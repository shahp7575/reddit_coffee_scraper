The acute nature of the symptoms of that ?more serious diagnosis had me struggling throughout my adulthood. The acutw' nature of it had left me hospitalized and unemployed, quite often

The acute symptom is complex and sounds...AWFUL: psychosis (which is NOT psychopathy...at all)

It is a 'break from reality' Perceived reality can turn upside down...one thing could be true....therefore everything is true...delusions of aliens find bedfellows with unrelated banal phenomena....'have I 'made' any coffee today'? what the hell does THAT mean dumb-ass stuff

Meanwhile...I have not been violent since early-onset adulthood.The symptomology has eased with age....THEN

So....
a/ cured my RBF (resting bitch face) somewhat
b wrote out my 'hate list': things I could NOT stand (like BLUE ink 🤮 I wrote; and could NOT stop....I did not re-read it

Then 'likes' 😳...HALF a page

There was a problem 🤔 Then I re-reD it (this hapened over 2 weeks) in PROJECT 'heal myself'....I needed to be less uptight maybe?

3/ I looked up my diagnosis...🤮🤮🤮; wrote up the symptoms...decided which ones I wanted to change; vs those that I did NOT want to change

Hope they wont lose much flavor over time...  
From a french webshop, prices are quite similar to US webshops I'd say, between 9 and 12 € for most bottles except ultra hot ones.  
There's also some I got from a peruvian shop. Recipes are more simple but there's peppers species I haven't tried...

My favorites among these I've already tried (some are already gone):  
\- Burns & McCoy Mezcaline : sweet but not too much, earthy, smoky and moderately spicy, very nice.  
\- Burns & McCoy Excubiarium : a nice green sauce tasty and with some enjoyabe spicy punch. I'd say the Hellfire Green Snot is quite similar.  
\- Savir Foods Amarillo : nice combination of sweet Amarillo peppers and habanero for a bit more punch.  
\- Savir Foods Lemondrop : limo peppers +lemon in a way it tastes more candied lemon and citric acid, but not sweet either. Goes nicely with sea food.  
\- Savir Food Jala Pepa : mild green sauce but with nice coriander  
\- Cantina Royal Tomasa : oily and hard to pour especially if stored cold, but very nice umami / mushroom taste. Heat is strong but progressive  
\- Cantina royal Tamaulipeka : some flavours similar to Tomasa, some different, a bit sweeter and a tad less spicy.  
\- Angry Goat Purple Hippo. Stronger than what I expected. The fruity side is fun but not what I prefer.  
\- Angry Goat Phoenix : I don't get any melon from it but the moderate heat and curry / mustard spices are nice.  
\- Queen Majesty : overall a bit too much on the vinegear side. The chocolate one has also a nice little cinnamon touch.  
\- Karma Funken hot, normal and yello edition : very hot and a tad sugary, but I haven't been able to feel the difference between the different peppers.",1,1731874035.0,hotsauce,0,1.0,False

Our new collection is here!
Our bath and body scent lists are organized a bit differently for our Holiday 2024 Collection. We have added more scents, but fewer options per product.

It was crowded, but I was lucky enough to get a 2 person table with an outlet. I stayed there for maybe three hours and ordered multiple items throughout my stay.

About an hour into my stay, a girl about my age who reeked of weed asked if she could share my table so she could study as well. I looked around and every other chair was occupied and there were even people standing beside the tables. I absolutely despise the smell of weed. It’s legal in my state so there’s no issues there, but it makes me nauseous and gives me a headache, so I knew there was no way I would get anything done with that girl across from me. Without mentioning her smell, I told her no and that I needed my personal space. 

Instead of walking away, she pressed and said that if I wanted my personal space I shouldn’t study in the most popular coffee shop in town. I then told her that I specifically didn’t want her at my table because she smelled like a marijuana farm and she should take a shower before she tries to infringe on strangers’ personal space. I thought she would go away after that, but she told me she was sitting at my table whether I liked it or not. She put her things down, maybe thinking I would leave.

Instead, I flagged down an employee and explained the situation. She sided with me and asked the girl to leave, threatening to call security if she didn’t do so. 

I resumed my work but felt a bit shaken by the situation. Later that evening, I recalled what happened to some of my friends. I thought that they would all agree that she was being an AH, but to my surprise, a couple of my friends told me I was the unreasonable one. One of them is familiar with the coffee shop and told me that it was rude of me to hog a table (even though I bought two drinks and a pastry throughout my stay), and that if I really had a problem with someone smelling bad, I should have just left. Another one of my friends said that my comment about how that person smelled was out of line, and even if someone is being rude I shouldn’t talk like that to a stranger. This sparked a huge debate until I agreed to post on this sub to settle this once and for all. So, am I TA in this situation?",1,1731873988.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

A bit about me: 

- I live with my husband, 3 year old son, dog, and cat in a small country town. We just inherited the cat recently and the 3 AM meowing concerts have been fantastic. 😂

- I work as a receptionist at a vet clinic. (Be prepared for pictures of puppies and kittens.) 

- For hobbies, I used to be really into baking and that’s something I’d like to pick up again. Can’t follow a recipe to save my life though. 😅 I’ve started building one of those mini book nooks for my bookcase. I also love to read. I’m currently reading Where the Sky Begins by Rhys Bowen. 

- I LOVE food. I have quite the sweet tooth as well. 😋

- I have a slight addiction to YouTube. 😬 Some of my favorite channels are Townsends, English Heritage, and Tasting History with Max Miller. 

- A few more random things that I like: The Sims, Disney, coffee, 90’s/00’s romcoms, overly dramatic TLC shows, and Phantom of the Opera. 

- If you’re into Myers-Briggs, I’m an INFP. My enneagram type is 9. 😁

I’m open to any gender, location, or age (18+) as long as it’s platonic. :)

I am still clearly overweight, but I have also clearly lost a lot of weight and it's noticeable. Before, all of my clothes didn't fit because they were too tight, and now they don't fit be they're too loose. My pants are falling off and shirts hang on me. I went from being a 3XL to a XL, so the size difference is really big. At first I was so excited about these changes, but now I get anxiety anytime I put on my clothes and see my reflection. All my clothes are huge and shapeless, so when I put them on they make me look bigger and have no shape and it sends me spiraling until I pull them tighter so I can see my figure. Has this happened to anyone else before, and if so how have you fixed it? I've tried sewing my pants along the waistline so they don't fall, but they're still huge around my thighs and butt.

1gtm8pb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gtm8pb,Time for Change? ECM Puristika? Niche Zero or Eureka Mignon Specialita? ($3500 CAD Budget),"Hello everyone, so I started in the world of espresso in 2023 after years of a Keurig Machine. I went from the Keurig Machine to a Philips 5400 super auto simply because I felt quite wasteful with all of the K-Cups I was going through. I only had the philips for about 2 months though because it kicked off my journey in learning about espresso and then it just felt like I was being edged on what coffee can taste like with my machine that was incapable of doing what I wanted regardless of the beans I bought.  

Now I am here. I have had this machine for about a year now and I have loved it very much throughout that time. I think this Breville Barista Touch Impress is the perfect machine to get if you can’t decide if you want to go full semi auto or not. Its smart barista feature (if you pay attention) teaches you roughly the basics on how to dial a new bean and workflow. If I had went from my super auto to the ECM Puristika that I am after now, I think I would have just been overwhelmed by the learning curve. This machine helped me figure out if I am down for the 5 minutes ish it takes to pull a shot from a real espresso set up or if i just want caffeine and convenience. 

So I have a few questions for the community. I never drink milk drinks because I have really gotten into specialty beans and in my opinion a milk drink with expensive specialty beans is like having louis xiii with coca cola. That means I have found that the ECM Puristika checks all of my boxes. For the grinder I am having trouble deciding between the Eureka Mignon Specialita and the Niche Zero. I drink 2 shots a day and I like a 22g shot for 44g liquid.

Is the ECM Puristika a good machine? is there something better at this price point or up to 30% more expensive? 

Niche Zero vs Eureka Mignon Specialita - (specialty beans like the ones photographed are my regular) 

Cheers

One thing to note is I did feel slightly overwhelmed and found myself and thoughts drifting from the service. I chalk that up to it all being so new! 

-The people were SO nice. Multiple people came up to me after liturgy introducing themselves, asking what brought me in, answering any quick questions I had at the moment. I thought I would save my longer more in depth questions for the priest, or maybe a different time than coffee hour (maybe unless you all think I should have asked some). 

- I was encouraged to come back to the variety of services by multiple people which was so nice to hear, and brought the welcoming feeling full circle. 

That is all! I hope you all have a wonderful day. ",1,1731873710.0,OrthodoxChristianity,1,1.0,False

I was drunk af and wasn't really looking great since I was staying at a friends' and didn't have my usual grooming routine. 

Wasn't shaved, hair probably looked terrible and I was so drunk I had seen her a few times and caught sight of her as she was leaving the toilet. I think I blurted something out like ""Hey, sorry don't wanna be weird but I saw you a couple times on the dancefloor and thought you look amazing, have a great night."" 

She was smiling from ear to ear and seemed receptive so I made few more comments and eventually got her insta. My friends were pulling me away so we could catch the train though so I couldn't hang about any longer. I think it was even worse in reality cause I was speaking way too quick and not really waiting for her replies. 

I sent her a text last night reinforcing how incredible she looked and a voice message this morning asking if she would like to meet up for coffee she said she had plans very abruptly.

Then I got flashback to last night and realised after getting her number I almost immediately turned around and started telling a girl friend who was there how she was the prettiest girl in the party and bragging about getting her number. I guess chances are 50/50 she wasn't too drunk and actually heard me saying that. The cringe is very strong. Could do with some comforting words...",0,1731873562.0,dating_advice,5,0.25,False

Different parts of the city, at different times of day. She's just everywhere. I’ll be on the tram, and I’ll spot her waiting to cross the street. I’ll be walking through the city center, and I’ll catch a glimpse of her out of the corner of my eye. I'll be waiting for a bus and notice her in the coffee shop across the street. People tend to see other people around the city I get it but but there's no one else I can think of that I've seen multiple times in this way and it just feels off.

I didn't really clock it as strange until she started carrying the same exact bag as me. It’s a Carhartt canvas tote bag, same color, same style. I keep seeing this woman with the same bag as me.

I have absolutely no chemistry knowledge apart from HS and very little disposable income for equipment (although mt friend does chem eng so he has access to labs) Anyway ere goes:

I am BROKE. However, I just found out Soma is OTC over here so i got a bunch of it. Each cap contains:
- 125mg carisoprodol
- 300mg acetaminophen
- 50mg diclofenac sodium
- 30mg caffeine

After some research and help from AI, I concluded that:
- STEP 1: Crushing the pills into fine powder and dissolving in water and then filter the insoluble NSAIDs with a coffee filter.
- STEL 2: Prepare (bake) Epsom salts and mix with the regular acetone to remove the any water molecules and make it anhydrous.
- STEP 3: Add anhydrous acetone to the original solution. This way the remaining caffeine will stay in the water and the carisoprodol in the acetone.
- STEP 4: Heat the solution at about 60 C so the carisoprodol-acetone will evaporate and separate from all the other substances.

My questions are:

1. Does this make any fucking sense or did Google and ChatGPT LIE to me?
2. How long should I stir/leave the solutions alone each step of the way?
3. How to I ""catch"" the carisoprodol-acetone vapor during heating?
4. How do I turn the vapor into crystal, a solid or maybe even liquid is better?
5. Will the remaining acetone in the final form be toxic? Anything I can do about it?

I think that's it. ChatGPT calculates I'll lose at least 25% carisoprodol with this extraction, but realistically I'll lose more like 50% haha. Thanks a bunch to everyone who took the time to read. Please help out this newbie haha. For clarification, I CAN buy some equipment but it's very limited.",0,1731873425.0,chemistry,3,0.5,False

1gtm19a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gtm19a,"Help, please!","Hello Xolofamilia, love living with these zany criaturas so much. Two quick questions. Our older Xolo (turns a year on Jan 1) has some breakouts on his neck, and recently noticed that our younger Xolo (3 months) is starting to get thicker skin on the back of her neck as well, with more blackheads. When I bathe them, I use a scrubber to exfoliate but don’t feel like it’s doing a thorough enough job. Was thinking about using a pumice stone gently (over the tough skin where there are no pimples of course). Have also made a scrub from scratch in the past with coffee, sugar, etc. What do you use to exfoliate them that you feel actually gets the blackheads so there’s not huge ones between baths, and prevents breakouts?

Second question - our younger Xolo Tochtli is almost certainly smarter than her older brother Akbal, but house training so far has been hard!! If we take her out constantly she will do her business outside, but she doesn’t ask to go out. She knows we want her to go outside but has kind of a nonchalant attitude about it. She doesn’t care if we scold her (the older one is like this about jumping up to see what’s on the counter for a snack)… have read this can be a breed thing but wondering since she’s still young if you have experience or ideas about how to work with her if it’s just stubbornness. She just went the whole night without going out and she can hold it for hours if she’s in our lap, for example. But she loves to pee or poop anywhere all over the house. She barks to ask us to pick her up on a couch or something, but if she goes to the door to go outside we may be missing it because she isn’t barking and does it quietly. We have bells hanging on the door which mostly works for the older Xolo, but I think she thinks it’s something I ring as I’m letting her out or telling her to go out. We aren’t using puppy pads with her, I just try to take her out a bunch every time I remember, but she’s sneaky! And they drink a lot of water so I feel like she doesn’t really hold it and just goes whenever she feels like it. 
We say she’s Chiquita, pero picosa! 🌶️

I’m a 28-year-old guy, and I’ve been seeing this incredible woman (27) for about two weeks now. We just had our second date, and honestly, I already think she’s amazing. She’s funny, intelligent, and our conversations flow naturall. We laugh a lot (though not in a rolling-on-the-floor way).

When we’re not together, we text daily, and I seem to be doing a decent job of keeping her entertained and making her laugh. But here’s the thing: I’m a little worried because we haven’t had much physical contact yet - just some casual touches on the arm during conversation - and we haven’t kissed. I know that’s not unusual, but I can’t shake this nagging feeling that maybe she doesn’t feel the same chemistry I do.

That said, we spent over six hours together yesterday, so I assume she enjoyed her time with me. Still, this is the first second date I’ve had that felt so... reserved, and I can’t stop overthinking it. I wondered if I should have just gone for it, but I didn’t want to be pushy, and the “right moment” didn’t seem to come.

We’re planning another meet-up soon — maybe coffee or even a trip to the cinema (her suggestion) — so that’s promising. But I’d really hate to mess this up. My flirting skills aren’t the strongest, and I keep second-guessing myself, looking for where I might have gone wrong.

I’d really appreciate any advice or reassurance. Thanks in advance! 😊",1,1731873241.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1gtm00o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gtm00o,Aeropress Premium review,"I've had my Aeropress Premium for a few days now. Ordered on October 18th from Williams Sonoma, delivered November 12th after showing backordered for a few weeks. Sharing a review here after brewing 4 times with it. Long time Aeropress fan, been making coffee this way for almost 10 years. The premium is my 5th press, the previous shown in the pictures is 6 years old having replaced the rubber plunger seal once. 

First impressions-
Unpacking it you immediately notice the weight compared to the plastic versions. The chamber is double walled glass, and the plunger is aluminum. The base of the chamber is heavy aluminum and the metal filter holder is stainless steel. I guess they used stainless steel since that is in contact with the coffee and aluminum might react and change the flavor. The plastic filter holder will fit, but notice the different number of holes due to the thicker walls of the glass chamber. Total weight without coffee is 1 lb 11 oz, compared to 6.5 oz for the original. 

Everything is metal, glass or rubber, including the stirrer and scoop. No plastic accessories; they don't include a funnel or filter holder, but those can be reused from the plastic version.

The brew chamber is the same outside diameter as the original, but it's taller due to the wall thickness. It has etched markings on the outside, these won't rub off like the original did.

Brewing-
I brew the same way everyday for years now. Water about 190°, two and a half scoops of dark roast beans on a fine filter burr grind. I bloom the grounds for 20 seconds then fill the chamber, slowly stir, then add a little more water by rinsing the stir stick in the chamber. So I move a lot of water through the grounds, but that's the way I like it.


Repeating this with the premium yielded a result that is close but not identical to the plastic version. I haven't figured out why but it's coming out a little more bitter and not quite as full-bodied, so I'm experimenting with different water temps and brewing time. I'm not sure yet if the glass and metal results in more or less cooling of the brew as compared to the plastic. I still press at the same rate, and use a fair amount of force at the end to compress the grounds and get every last extracted goodness.

The coffee seems to drip through a bit slower than the plastic version, so I've noticed there is less air being pushed through at the end of the press in the way that I make my coffee.

When you finish brewing with the premium, the metal filter holder will be hot so you need to let it cool or rinse with water before you remove it and press out the puck. I'm used to the paper filter staying attached to the coffee puck, but with the premium it's not, it's stays in the holder and I have to pull it out. That might be due to the batch of filters I have which seems slightly larger than usual. It does use the same paper filters, and you could even use the plastic strainer if you wanted.

I normally press out the puck in a fast motion with a satisfying thunk at the end, but with the premium I'm being more cautious. The plunger does have a rubber ring at the top to cushion it when it contacts the glass, but I'm still being more gentle, because glass. I'm looking forward to many years of use without developing any scratches in the chamber. That is the main reason I invested in the premium. Also the less plastic contacting our hot acidic beverages the better, right?

Final thoughts-
Overall I'm impressed with the build quality and materials for the premium. The cost is high, but I've already spent that much money buying plastic versions that don't last forever. The only thing that might wear out on this is the rubber plunger seal so I hope that those will be available in the future to replace. The only change I would suggest at this point is include some sort of funnel for those who don't have one, otherwise it's a challenge to add your grounds and not make a mess.

But anyways I cherish my results because I’m a history buff. Not only have I been interested in history for about 11 years now but what specifically began my journey as a history buff was the European Age of Discovery. At least beginning with Christopher Columbus. Sorry Portugal. But my results remind me of what I call the Atlantic World and the Triangular Trade. Triangular Trade pictures have always captured my attention and interest. And my ancestry results remind me of it. So how could I not be happy? 

I posted a similar post not long ago but that was on the Ancestry DNA subreddit. So if you happen to have seen that hello again. 

The only way I’d like my results more is if I were 1/3 of European, African, and Native American. But I’m mostly African but that’s cool.

Hello everyone welcome back, or I guess welcome first if your the kind of mad lad who opens chapter books to just a random page and just sort of keeps going…. Live dangerously I suppose if you represent the latter. To start off with today, minor Content warning, There's a bullying scene in here, so sorry if it's bad or unrealistic. Despite my best efforts, I was never bullied in high school or middle school, so I only have fictional bullying to draw upon, lame!

But otherwise strap in because we got intrigue! we got action! And we got clothing talk! As Emma explains to everyone why she shouldn't have to wear any. all of this and more in this episode of wearing nothing to magic school!!!!!

  
  
  
  


Chapter 9 



**The Transgracian Academy, Academy Hallways, on Route To Dining Hall**



**Emma Booker**



My Immortal companion Tim Tam was a last minute addition to this operation, I was originally only able to bring an instance of him with me provided I keep him in his virtual holding area, the ultimate kitty playground, where a virtual instance of me could play with him and give him all the attention he could ever want or need. I could of course take him out, but only If I was certain his presence would not compromise this operation, but seeing as our mission parameters had changed, I was weapons free to unleash our fluffy secret weapon.

 

As a result the first steps of Operation Tubman were going well, Tim Tam has always been a savvy operator and is playing his role to purfection, This particular assignment was right up his alley and Tim Tam never disappoints.

  


There were of course other issues to contend with as my plans regarding Aurin, Tim Tam and the academy slave stock progressed. The first one being the theft of my one and only piece of ‘luggage’. For the singular crate I had been sent with was in fact not a mere piece of luggage but actually Evi, disguised as a crate, which contained our ECS relay for communicating back home, Professor Mal’tori seemed to take a brief interest in it, likely because of the mana pumps built into it to start charging the ECS as soon as it arrived in the nexus.



Since the box was actually EVI, she quickly disengaged the pumps and locked down the crate tighter than the 22nd century fort knox. When the man eventually decided to up and steal the package wholesale, Evi simply escaped with the crates contents through the fourth dimension. Leaving the academy and Mal’tori with only an empty box and a pissed off instance of EVI to keep them company. That being said the foe exterior of the crate was still made of near irreplaceable mana resistant nanites, that we would very much like to reclaim, not that EVI didn't have plenty of nanites to work with already, it would just be nice to not let those ones go to waist, and also not give the college any free samples to experiment on. So the current plan was to ‘self destruct’ the  package, providing a feasible and politically suitable cover story for the package's re-appropriation. 



Since the academy had stolen the package and claimed it hadn’t arrived at the nexus to begin with, a claim I had no intent on refuting, they couldn't pin it on us as a hostile action if that package was to inexplicably explode. It was never here to begin with, their own words, which they had so helpfully put into writing, in the form of the handy letter they had delivered to the dorm just last night, signed and all.



With that letter In hand and the gang on our way to get some breakfast, It was my plan to deliver my veiled **warning,** directly to the professors table, because at the end of the day I still didn't want anyone to get hurt.



With this plan and many others well in mind, me and the gang proceeded on our way through the academy halls. They were quite nervous for various reasons, and almost all of those were unfortunately my fault in one way or another. Thalmin was nervous because of all the Nulls running around, a byproduct of my overly successful soul binding prevention. Thacea was nervous because of my oversharing about my inhuman feats of literacy, and Illunor was nervous because of my freakout last night.



Though Illunor at least didn’t have the nulls to worry about, not because they wouldn’t attack him, but because he didn’t know about them because I have been tactfully hiding and obfuscating mine, Thaceas and Thalmins conversations, to prevent others from listening in and also to stop Illiunor from parroting everything we say to Mal’tori.

  
  
  


While I couldn't do much to put Thacea’s and Illunor’s minds at ease, I could at least reassure Thalmin that I was perfectly capable of keeping him safe. I regarded him as he walked with a hand firmly on the hilt of his blade and his ears at full attention swiveling back and forth listening for threats.



I regretted telling him about the nulls at this point, their presence had clearly put him on edge, and was causing him undue stress that would more than likely never even manifest. The only reason I had even warned the gang to begin with, was because the spatial trickery of the academy was making the nulls somewhat difficult to track down, but it's not like I would miss one coming right at us. And only the administration building had those spatial defenses in place, so we were golden in the student areas.



“Thalmin I urge you to relax yourself, the threat from the Nulls to your person is so minimal, It's unlikely you will even get to see one today, unless of course you want to see one of the ones I have already caught.”



“I appreciate your concern Emma, but It would be improper for a mercenary prince of all things to not take responsibility for his own safety, besides, we can't all be as in-vulnerable as you Emma” Thalmin said somewhat jokingly.



“Sure you can!” I said cheerily “With my blessing at least, would you care for a demonstration?”



Thalmin stopped for a second, turning his full attention to me, a cautious look on his wolfy face. “Wait, that's an option?” he said with a hint of apprehension to his growly voice. “Of course I can, if anything comes at you be it an artificed blade or magical spell I can make sure it never even touches you.”



“Oh” he said simply, clearly considering seriously what I had to say.



“I can show you what I mean real quick, If you would allow me” I said to him, allowing a mischievous lilt to grace my voices. Thacea looked at me warily, while Illunor looked at Thalmin all confused, likely wondering why he had stopped.



“I don’t know about that Emma, what would this blessing cost?” He asked with a degree of trepidation in his voice ”What would it require on my end?”



“Oh absolutely nothing” I responded “I was being facetious when I called it a blessing, and I would have done it with no input from you at all should you encounter any threat to your safety and well being. We are peers after all!” I said encouragingly.



“That is quite the ability Ema, the armies of your world must be quite fearsome if your battle mages can conjure up such protections.” Thalmin replied.



“I just don't want you to trouble yourself with a threat that's really a non issue Thalmin. Frankly I wish I hadn’t told you about the nulls, since Thacea told you about them in the dorms, I have already caught two more of them roaming around the campus. My offer of demonstration and protection were only to help put your mind at ease.”



Thalmins head perked up confused at that statement “Wait, you have caught two more of these nulls? Did they attack us? You were on the balcony the whole morning, how can you have captured these nulls? Are we even talking to you right now, are you astrally projecting yourself possibly?”



“Lets just say for now that I am really good at multi tasking, And I am indeed here Thalmin” I said placing a single hand on the lupinors shoulder. “Now please, relax yourself, how are you going to appreciate your breakfast if your stomach is all tied up in knots from stress” I said before playfully taking another hand and phasing my fingers through his breastplate and tickling the soft lupinorian underbelly that lay beneath it.



Thalmin desperately suppressed his laughter, Illunor looked on in horror, and Thacea rolled her eyes. While Thalmin responded by pushing my arm away; which I allowed; but I didn’t relent, simply reaching in with another arm to attack him from a different angle, he quickly pushed that one away as well stifling a wolfish giggle, he jumped back from me and drew his blade taking on a martial defensive stance.



With a barely contained smile on his face he attempted to menace me with his sword, despite the fact we both knew from the night before it would have no effect. “Hey now, that's enough of that from you!” he spoke.



“What’s wrong Thalmin” I said cheerily “Is the dreaded mercenary prince ticklish”



“Try that again and find out” he snarled.



I took him up on his offer, playing along, and instead of cheating and phasing through his sword and arm, I instead nimbly dodged his strikes dodging left and right even allowing it to pass between the gaps in my arms and torso before following up and tickling him from both sides with two arms this time.



We engaged in this good natured horseplay for a few fleeting joyful moments, audibly giggling all the while, before we were cut off by a sharp chirp from Thacea, in regards to the sound of a frantic looking academy apprentice; flanked by gargoyles; approaching from around the hallway ahead of us.



Thalmin quickly sheathed his blade and I adopted my resting pose, attempting to look like we hadn’t just had a straight up tickle duel on academy grounds. My deception was flawless as always but I could tell Thalmin was struggling somewhat to keep the smirk off his face, not helped by me tapping him on his lower arm near his belly right as the apprentice passed us.



Though the apprentice would have been unlikely to notice anything of us anyways, as he had been tasked amongst other apprentices, with hunting down the nulls, most of which I had already captured.



The gang didn't seem to comment on the state of the apprentice, who I left undisturbed from his wild goose chase, and we proceeded to receive a brief chiding from Thacea.



“If you two could refrain from such blatant breaks from decorum in public that would be much appreciated” Thacea said in a tone of voice any disappointed motherly figure would be proud of.



Thalmin smirked and gave me a knowing look before responding “Of course princess, we will behave”



”At least in the presence of our fellow students” I added. ”What the point of going to college If its all work no play” I said whilst Regarding Thalmins elevated mood, and noticing Thacea;s mood shift to one more of annoyance, rather than concern.



All according to plan.

  


==================================



**The Transgracian Academy, Dining Hall**



**Emma Booker**

  
  


When we entered the dining hall we were ushered to our seats by wait staff dressed similarly to the ones who had served us the night prior. Served by a similar eclectic collection of various anthropoid servers and humanoid elves, we also dined in a similarly gaudish dining hall.



I would say it appeared like an upscale fantasy themed diner, but those diners never thought to add so much gold filigree, colored banners and finely detailed molded wall accents. And while a traditional earth designer could emulate this room, they would instead likely put just as much effort into making their establishments look old and worn, that would otherwise be required to make a similar room appear this shiny and flawless.

  


We were sat at an out of the way table which didn’t really impact my plans either way, and Thalmin took the lead in ordering for all of us, the entire platter as he said, and one order for each of us.



“We are going to put that stomach of yours to the test earthrealmer” thalmin spoke cheekily at me “Or at least what you have in place of a stomach, for through our tenure here at the academy, we are going to fill you up with the finest of Nexian delicacies.”



“I would advise against making it a competition Thalmin” Thacea spoke up ”I witnessed the earthrealmer devour half a tea set this morning. I fear she may have even the formidable lupinorian stomach beat in terms of capacity”



“Ah you'll find us Lupinor not dissuaded so easily princess” Thalmin spoke before holding aloft a cup of some form of coffee equivalent before taking a massive swig.



While conversation amongst Me, Thacea, and Thalmin had picked up again, similar to the first day after I had arrived here. I sent off an instance of myself up to the sparsely populated and elevated professors’ table, to converse with its sole occupant.



During our chatting at the table, I frequently noticed Illunor gazing longingly at the other tables, the nobles gossiping away Idly, clearly wishing to be part of the conversation, or any conversation, but not allowed to get up and join due to the rules of decorum. Thacea seemingly noticed this too, eyeing me critically before opening her beak, making her opinion known. 



“Emma, I understand your qualms with Lord Rularia and the quality of his character, as well as your desire to protect me from his barbed words, but simply put, his temperament and personality are far from unique in the nexus. If we are to refuse to interact with him, we are refusing to interact with the majority of the beings of the nexus, which will simply not do, and once again I will remind you, we are a peer group, and any perceived division amongst our ranks can and will be exploited by outside parties.”



“I understand Thacea, and I am happy to integrate him back into our conversations, but you must know if you chose to do so now, that you must avoid any talk of my realm, my capabilities and pretty much anything you would not rather not be repeated to Nexian officials in general, same goes for you thalmin.”



“I highly doubt the venurian would be so petty as to out every single one of the verbal slights of his peers Emma, the lizard quite enjoys his verbal sparring” thalmin retorted.



“He will if he’s bound by contract to Mal’tori to spy on us” I responded flatly.



“Excuse me?” Thacea responded, visibly taken aback.



“Illunor is contract bound to spy on us, well specifically me, but I doubt Mal’tori would much care who he is getting info on if he can use it to get another one of his lackeys into our peer group by outing any one of you for something said offhandedly in the confidence of peers.”



“Oh” Thacea replied clearly, doing the mental calculations on how this might affect the year going forward.“ That will certainly complicate the peer group dynamic going forward, but I'm afraid we must find a way to work around this Emma, if we are to survive this academic year in one piece”



“Oh I wouldn't worry about that to much Thacea, I reckon I can have this binding contract issue squared away by days end.” I said confidently.



=======================



**The Transgracian Academy, Dining Hall, Professors Table**



**Apprentice Lauriel**

  


I stared with dread at the half eaten salad before me, anxiety making it hard to find my appetite in these trying times. I sat alone at the professors table.



On any other day it would be an honor to be entrusted with overseeing so many malleable young noble minds. But I know today that was not the case.



For not only had the professors been called away to focus their efforts on the ritual of duplicity, their efforts had unfortunately been subverted by mysterious and unknown forces. Resulting in the crisis we have had to deal with both last night and today.



A crisis, that is what the dean had called it, and given what we knew of our illusive foe, a crisis was an apt description for it.



Due to the suspected actions of a certain new realmer, who’s presence could not be missed, the ritual of duplicity had failed. Not just to bind one name, but 23 names. 23 names had completely failed to bind, and there lies only one outcome for such an event, the creation of a Null.



A powerful and illusive beast in its own right, more than enough on its own to give even a professor of the academy pause for concern, but there were now 23 of them, roaming around the campus, alluding our detection spells, and prowling the campus with only one goal in mind, to lethally bind themselves to the students they had failed to take the likeness of.



I for one found myself agreeing with the dean over my academic master Mal’tori, we should not have gone through with the ritual of duplicity, the blackened signatures of the 23 students being an obvious warning of the dangers to come. Warnings that my master chose to ignore. Be it because of confidence or fear, I do not know.



All I knew was that as soon as my duties here were complete, I was to return to this hunt, along with all the other apprentices and gargoyles who now roamed the halls in search of these allusive foes.



While the outbreak was kept on the down low for now, while frantic calls were made for planar level mages to bolster our security. Most of our efforts were centered around securing the student areas, which caused suspicions to abound throughout the student body, from the extra gargoyle patrols that now roamed the academy's halls.



An air of concern propagated across the dining hall, which an apprentice of the academy like me had no problems picking out.



“Have you noticed the above average gargoyle presence”



“I have, I heard rumors of panicked apprentices accompanying them”



“Has some interloper infiltrated these storied halls”



“Preposterous! To think an institution sanctified by his eternal majesty himself capable of such ineptitude of security, as to let any wood be interloper penetrate this far into its walls, It's simply a ridiculous notion, borderline heretical I would say!”



Almost all of the tables had taken notice of the increased gargoyle presence, only a few suspected anything thankfully, but only one carried on as if nothing suspicious had happened at all. Not that I would suppose to know what looked like normal, for such an eclectic band of outcasts and social pariahs.



I glanced at the table of the contract bound lord, the mercenary prince, the tainted princess, and the ‘potential’ cause of all my current woes. A mysterious being, one whose horrid visual presence demanded the attention of every eye in the room, whilst simultaneously seeming to effortlessly return every errant glare.



But while their visual appearance demanded attention, their lack of any presence in the mana field would make them fade into the background in almost any other case. As if their appearance alone was designed to make up for this incongruity in their existence.



As I briefly cast the table a glare, pondering their peer groups incongruous demeanor, the earth realmer appeared to take notice of my passing glance, suddenly directing a number of their array of eyes directly at me.



I felt my chest tense up and my fingers reflexively tense up upon my salad fork. Though I maintained a face of passive indifference, well disciplined in the keeping of decorum, as my time in the academy, and efforts in attaining such a lucrative apprenticeship had taught me well in such matters.



I subtly glanced away, attempting to visually pay the earthrealmer no mind, but It seems they would not have it.



“Oh, greeting apprentice, I hope the morning has treated you well!” The newrealmer’s distinctive means of vocalizing graced my ears, as if vocalizing from right next to me, and not across a crowded noisy room. If it’s distinct chorus of voices was the creature's natural way of speaking, or some ridiculous magic affectation I did not know.



“I'm glad I got your attention actually, I was hoping to strike up a conversation with you. I have so many interesting tales of my realm to share, I think some of them you would find quite interesting”



What I did know, is that this lowborne was deigning to speak to me directly, in a clear afront to decorum, have I had more patience, I would have reprimanded such a blatant violation, but for now I simply cast a privacy field around myself, blotting out such wanted attempts at attention grabbing.



Or at least I thought this would blot out whatever speaking magics this new realmer was using, but It seemed that their audacity bore no bounds. Suddenly manifesting beside me.



I jumped up slightly at their sudden and unexpected appearance beside me.



“Wha.. What, What do you think you are doing here New Realmer! This is the professors table, you are not allowed to sit here! Nor are you allowed to leave your table unless you are dismissed!” I said audibly infuriated, the earth realmers lack of noticeable expressiveness not hinting as to whether my proclamations had affected them at all.



“Oh but I'm not sitting at the professors table” the new realmer ahead of me retorted. “Nor have I left my table” they said gesturing with one arm towards the table of their peer group where she….



Was sitting and chatting with her peer group?



“I have done nothing wrong as you can see, and actually this leads in perfectly to one of the things I was wanting to tell you about. You see in my realm we have this field of study called holographics, it similar to you school of illusion magic, but instead of using it for tricks and japes, we use our equivalent for boring things like remotely attending business meetings and stuff, Kind of like I’m doing now using a system called telepresence” She said enthusiastically.



“That does not mean you are allowed to interfere with the members of the professors table without following expectant decorum” I fumed now standing above the new realmer before me. Before considering what the new realmer had just said. Wait If this was some kind of illusion magic like the newrealmer had professed to, was I talking down to some kind of conjured image? Where was its mana-field then? It appeared as blank as the newrealmer itself making it indistinguishable from them.



“Actually apprentice, I wanted to thank you for your actions last night, for delivering me that letter regarding the fate of my luggage. It is a shame that it never arrived at the academy, but I am grateful I did not have to live with the uncertainty of its fate for even a second longer.” The newrealmer spoke as if I was not even here.



Wait, what was this? Was I talking to a memory fragment? some pre recorded message? I waved my hand through it, trying to disrupt the illusion like one would a regular illusion spell. Though my hand passed right through the image, it had not broken up the image like one would suspect. The illusionary new realmer continued.

“You know interesting thing that those class 10 United Nations high security packages got going on there, you see they have built within them, an explosive anti-theft mechanism, perfectly harmless, only designed to destroy the contents of the package, quite ingenious actually, specifically tuned so the crate can perfectly contain the explosive forces held within, while denying access to its contents to any would be thief!”



Wait? What’s this about the crate? I quickly checked myself to ensure the integrity of the privacy field around us. Did the new realmer know about the crate theft? Surely not, they had no way of knowing.



“Newrealmer I have little time for your ramblings, cease this brazen reach above your lowly station or I will be forced to take disciplinary action against you, that is well within my right to dispense!” I said with finality, though the newrealmer, either out of brashness or foolishness continued unperturbed.



“These crates do possess one design flaw, let say a certain uh.. I don’t know.. magically inclined professor, frustrated at his failed attempts to gain access to a completely mana-resistant box, then insisted on trying to simply smash it open utilizing brute force, It could potentially cause the exterior or the crate to be compromised, potentially setting off the explosives held within prematurely, which due to crates now compromised state, would be unable to contain the explosive forces held within, actually allowing the container to cause bodily harm to any who may be within Its 50 foot kill radius and 80 foot injury radius.”



This caused me to pause, actually replaying the new realmers words in my mind, a jolt of fear coursed down my spine, before I quickly collected myself and made sure to demonstrate my resolve to the new realmer.



“Is that some kind of threat?” I spoke sternly.



“WHAT! A THREAT? NO NO NO NO NO apprentice I must apologize for any misunderstanding” the newrealmer spoke apologetically before transitioning to a more ominous chorus of voices. “For you see I only wished to express my most sincere gratitude to you and your college for your diligence in informing me of the fate of my luggage, and I simply wished to reciprocate with thanks and also some, I'm sure, very interesting information on earthrealm packaging techniques. Fun bits of information like say how I was given this timer right here to keep an eye on the countdown for the explosive mechanisms within the crate”



The earthrealmer said, placing some form of time keeping device on the table before me, also mysteriously lacking in a mana-prescense, like the newrealmer and its illusion before. Though the timepiece was clearly real as It ruffled the cloth on the table unlike the illusion before me.



“Though I suppose I don't need it now, seeing as the package was lost and never arrived in the academy at all, as stated in writing by the signed letter I received directly to my dorm”



I eyed the new realmer intently, seeing the game they intended to play, which admittedly had me at a complete loss on how to proceed. Had they accused me of theft I would have quickly shot it down their accusatory words as baseless conjecture,  but they instead, infuriatingly, wished to reaffirm the academy's narrative whilst subverting it with bluffs of their own. A narrative I was bound by decorum to uphold.



With myself being at a loss for how to proceed, the new realmer wasted no time filling in the gaps in our unwanted discourse. “Perhaps you should keep this timepiece Apprentice Lauriel, consider it a thank you gift for all your hard work. It is quite finely crafted, and I imagine such a studious apprentice as yourself will find some use for it.” The Earthrealmer spoke before scribbling something on a napkin on the table, before dispelling their strange projection, leaving me standing alone at the professors table, shaken and at a loss for words.



I quickly sat down, dispelling the privacy screen and glancing around the room. The newrealmer sat at their table as if nothing had happened. I detected no chatter regarding the newrealmer’s highly inappropriate and visible breach of decorum, as if no one had seen it or bore it any mind.



Though I knew the discourse had indeed happened, because sat before me on the table, was a strange silver colored timekeeping device, seemingly mechanical in nature, finely crafted, though it seemed to have some lightly glowing elements to its faces, though they glowed without any visible disturbance of the mana streams. It gave off mechanical ticking noises as it ticked down, 62 hours and 3 minutes, left on the countdown, and on the napkin the Earthrealmer had inscribed simply two numbers 50,80.



The fundamental truths dictated that this new realmer should have nothing to offer to the nexus, nothing to barter with, and certainly no footing by which to threaten us from, but as I thought back to my experiences so far, the anomalous form of the new realmer and the strange feats and capabilities she had displayed so far, I felt a pang of concern all the same.

  


=======================

**The Transgracian Academy, Academy Hallways**



**Emma Booker**



“I'm afraid I will be unable to accompany you on your library venture” said Illunor “As I have a number of affairs to attend to, I'll be in our dorm later if you need me.” He spoke cordially enough before leaving to either A. Speak with Mal'tori (82.3% probability index rating) or B. Go to the bathroom (15.8% probability index rating) given the fullness of his bladder.



The dismissal of my invitation to go with us to the library was mostly certain however, given how I was aware of his standing orders from Maltori from the get go. So asking him was merely a courtesy, and an attempt to extend an olive branch.



“What matters could you possibly have this soon in the year Illunor?” Thalmin spoke, clearly fishing for answers.



“Personal Matters!” The lizard spoke with his back now to us, quickly scurrying off.



“Hmpf” Thalmin chuffed ”I've never seen the lizard move with such purpose” Thalmin spoke offhandedly.



“It is certainly concerning given the new context we have been given, when measured against his change in demeanor.” Thacea followed. As our peer group pulled an about face and began walking towards the academy exit.



“He will be free to lie around all day and yell at wait staff soon enough Thacea, one day he’ll look back at this harrowing” I make a motion to check a non-existent watch “Roughly 24 hour period and laugh” I said jovially.



“A contract is a very serious affair Emma”



“An affair which can only be rescinded by the contractor holder. Yes I'm aware Thacea, I assure you I have done my homework and have a rock solid solution in mind, and no it does not involve hard resetting Maltori to do it.”



“I'm sorry, do what to Mal’tori?” Thacea quickly shot back before we were interrupted by a very officious and very bovine “Well Well Well……”



While I found the bull’s interruption to be quite rude, I fought the urge to mute him at the second ‘well’, in his series of wells. Given Thacea’s comments earlier on facing the music as it were in regards to academy discourse.



And besides I wouldn't mind a good verbal spar with the flesh folk. Not being able to dunk on the systemic failings and inherent stupidity of nobility would be a major let down, in part due to the fact I was currently in the process of befriending a prince and a princess. But that just added a fun extra bit of challenge.



“...I see the new realmer has failed to pack even an extra outfit on their voyage to the nexus, it's unfortunate your realm is such of poor means that they could only afford to furnish their chosen candidate in only a single outfit.” The bull said in a faux charitable voice, seemingly only making half an effort to sound concerned at my situation.“



“Yes quite unfortunate indeed lord ping, it seems they are so unfamiliar with the ways of simple clothing, she neglected to dress herself before even entering the portal, and to think she is a mage of some kind in her realm, I can only imagine their ungifted commoners must have it worse. Then again that is assuming that outfit is indeed real and not some kind of illusion created in panic when confronted with more civilized races.” The butterfly lady before me spoke.



“Ah not unfortunate at all Lady Ladonna” I said, speaking directly to the butterfly women in question, deciding to kill them with kindness as my first strategy, cause you know, diplomat and all. Leave the actual killing for plan Z as the good director always said. “For you see casting off the tyranny of clothing has actually been a long standing battle for my people, a battle waged across many eras an for many reasons, for you see age old social norms used to force the women in my realm into very specific and quite limited socio political roles in our society, complicated and restrictive clothing, often being seen as the physical embodiment of such oppression, throughout our history women have fought to cast aside these restrictions as well as their clothing, to fight for equal rights of both liberty and nakedness to our male counterparts!” I said proudly proclaiming about some admittedly quite done and dusted equality issues our society had long since overcome.



“WHAT!?” Thalmin, Thacea, and even Lady Ladonna all gasped in unison. Though Auris Ping seemed to get his act together the quickest to disparage my claims.



“Preposterous, how backwards is your realm to cast aside such a…. a commonsense hallmark of civilized society!” The bull bellowed with a hint of anger penetrating his previously well put together demeanor.



“Well with the way our society has developed, clothing of any color quality or design is very easy to come by. It hasn’t been used as a status symbol for some time, therefore being worn solely for the purposes of practicality, comfort, or self expression. Those needs and desires vary from person to person and culture to culture, but some people choose to express themselves by wearing nothing at all! And did not one of you see my cool body art, like I had this whole renaissance painting vibe going on.”



This time Thacea interjected, and on Auris and Ladonna’s side the traitor!



“Emma you can’t just wear nothing in a public venue like that, ignoring the issues of hygiene, becoming ill and exposure to elements, there are certain elements of the biological form that are best kept to ones selves, elements that have certain connotations when exposed.”



“Thacea I am a digian, those *parts* are completely optional, Also we can't get sick either so both of those points are mute. Also Also nudity is a social construct, and with most social constructs your argument essentially boils down to, we don't do that because we don't do that, It is a perfect example of ad populum fallacy.”



Ladonna seemed to double down on her stance at this “It is clear the newrealmer, not having any cards in which to play or legs for her arguments to stand on is merely trying to confuse us with complete nonsense. It is clear that her outfit must simply be an illusion, and not even a very imaginative one, as it was clearly inspired by the noble dress she saw when first entering the room, her realm possessing no existing clothes to draw inspiration from, even copying the white glowing robes of the dean! A very novice set of moves I must say, made in a futile attempt to justify her realm's primitive and impoverished nature.”



The peer group gathered behind ladonna let out a series of haughty laughs at that, which I allowed before following up with my rebuttal.



“It's also a novice move in an argument, Lady Ladonna, to speak out of ignorance based completely in unresearched conjecture. And to address your previous concerns while yes this outfit was imagined on the spot, and indeed inspired by the dress of the assembled crowd before me, I assure you it was merely done as an attempt to fit in, and to abide by the rules of our gracious hosts. Though I must say once again, clothing is easy to come by in my realm and this dress is no illusion.” I said as I snapped my fingers.



And In a flash of light, and with a snap of my fingers I summoned for myself a new outfit, This time going for something a bit more contemporary, but also showy, having an better Idea of what these people considered fancy, even some basic streetwear could be considered an outfit made for a noble lord via color and cleanliness alone.



I opted for a stylish gold puffy vest jacket, layered with a white stylized last windshifter t-shirt and some nice jeans with glowing inlays, and I also made sure to add some of my favorite holo stickers for that personal flair.



In that same moment, in that same flash of light Auris Ping also found himself in my previous outfit.



“What I am wearing now Is an example of some more contemporary fashion from my realm” I said towards Ladonna, who looked on in genuine awe, for only a moment before Auris realized what I had done to him.



“Wait, what is this!?” Auris asked enraged.



“How’s it feel Auris? Real I’d hope” I asked.



“Insolence!” Auris declared.



“No that’s a dress” I replied “and I think it suits you quite well!” I said encouragingly, as I had actually made an effort to make sure it fit him properly, and the dress actually complemented his fur color quite well now that I looked at it.



I Imagine Auris would tear into me a bit more, but it seems our little discussion had drawn the attention of more than a couple of students.



“Awh can you believe it Auris Ping has allowed himself to be dragged down into a confrontation with a self purported commoner, how the mighty have fallen”



“And to fall for the unstructured ramblings of a newrealmer, such a horrendous mistake”



“Her conduct is scandalous and her words preposterous, but It could hardly be considered unstructured rambling”



“What fascinating articles of clothing, It's simple but also eclectic, and it also has a certain presence to it. Perhaps this new realm will have something to offer, at least in terms of it’s aesthetic arts”



“Yes, truly an intriguing and alien form of dress for an equally alien people.”



Auris reading the overall vibe of the room, seemed to decide to cut his losses.



“You will return to me my clothes newrealmer, now!” Auris said in a very forcibly leveled voice.



“Sure thing” I cheerily replied Before snapping my fingers and assuring everyone was in their starting outfits “Oh and by the way, If you need any tailoring services in the future, be sure to hit me up”



“Wait, you took my measurements?” Auris spoke in realization.



“No I just eyeballed It” I replied “I would say I didn’t look, but I can't help but always.. look, these eyes ain't for show”



“Wait, what do you mean?” Lady Ladonna replied with a now frantic and concerned look.



“I mean I see everything, and I mean everything… so… Maybe put some clothes on perverts!” I said irreverently.



At this The eyes of most people in the room lit up in realization, Auris Ping Lady Ladonna and her peer group slowly backed away.



Thacea Sighed, Thalmin smirked, the rest of our classmates in attendance displayed various degrees of concern, incredulity, and even some curiosity. Nice.



As we continued on our way and separated from the crowd, Thacea gave me an annoyed look because of my antics.



“Hey don't look at me like that, I proved my tricks aren’t just tricks, I knocked Auris's and Ladonna's peer groups down a peg, and I even got to show off some Earthrealm fashion.”



“I think that went quite well!”

(TLDR: starting a co-*werking*/study group of gays & queers for laid-back socializing & productivity partners)

I'm 25 and recently moved to DC to start a PhD program at AU. With the amount of time I have to spend on schoolwork and reading it's been tough trying to meet new friends (I have a small cohort and they're nice but it's literally me and four straight men). So I'm thinking about getting a group of gays together who might be in somewhat similar situations to 1. meet new friends and get to know the community better, 2. help actually be productive and get stuff done, and 3. explore the city a little.

If anyone is like me and hopelessly unproductive at home or would just like to make some new connections in a pretty laid-back setting let me know if you're interested! It's DC I know there are plenty of us who either have to study, fairly demanding remote jobs, or are very behind on books to read 😅😂

Don't have a solid structure worked out but it wouldn't be anything too formal. Probably just find a coffee shop, library, or someplace to meet once or twice (or more) a week for anyone who can make it.

Open to ideas for places to meet, ideas about the group in general, and would gladly take help from anyone who'd like to help me organize and knows the city a little better lmao. Feel free to reply to this thread or dm me",0,1731872790.0,DCGaybros,0,0.5,False

For context- this will be my first espresso machine. I have never been a filter coffee drinker, (never enjoyed regular coffee) but a few months ago I was in desperate need of caffeine and hit up a Starbucks and tried a macchiato and realized that espresso hits me completely and totally differently than regular filter coffee. No heartburn, more effectively felt the caffeine and I just loved the different taste. 

So after spending *way* too much in a single month at Starbucks, I decided to peer down the rabbit hole that is home espresso. I was at first on a very low budget, bc I wanted to be sure I would actually drink it before investing more money. I ended up with an aero press, and making “espresso style coffee” as you can with it, and I really enjoy it. But it is not espresso. So I decided to take the plunge and get a grinder and espresso machine. I ended really stretching my budget on the grinder, ended with a DF64 gen 2. But because of that I wanted to stay really budget and entry level on the espresso machine. 

I did literally weeks of research, and ended up between a Gaggia Classic, the Apex v2 and the hibrew H10a. I was basically decided on the H10a because the reviews I saw were good and it was $279 vs $499 for the other two. But as I was going to purchase the H10a, i discovered the 210 plus was just hitting the market, but listed at $399. 

Adding variable pressure and a solenoid valve to the H10a seemed like a no brainer for me just bc I’d rather have the dryer puck to deal with. Plus the improved aesthetic and larger drip tray- I was pretty much all in, especially bc I found it on the 11.11 sale on aliexpress with a coupon code for $60 off. 

So it ended up being $340 for the hibrew H10 plus and I felt good about it. Started shopping for some accessories, namely a scale and bottomless portafilter, when I came across the apex v2 also on Ali express, in the color I had preferred…. Also for $340 out the door between sale price and another coupon code. So I bought it (this one was shipping from a US warehouse with free return shipping) and decided I would have to make up my mind later but didn’t want to miss out on the option at that price.

And so now I am STUCK. There is next to no reviews about the H10 plus because it’s so new. I prefer the look of the H10 plus quite a bit. But it seems like the apex v2 is a more capable machine and would be an absolute steal at just under $350. 

Does anyone have experience with both the H10a and the apex v2? (Or one of its other names, I know they vary by region.) Are they in the same class as far as what they can put out? I think probably the largest differentiator is the separate heating block on the steamer of the apex, so even though I know you can’t brew and steam simultaneously, it’s much easier to bounce back and forth between the two to my understanding. I know these are both budget machines from china, but I think they both are in the range of sweet spot for me between budget and features, since I’m willing to compromise on the brand name and possibly the longevity vs legacy brands…..

Any advice or insight into which machine would be the better choice (both cost me $340 so price is a push) would be soooooo appreciated!",1,1731872583.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

So I was sitting on the couch, and my toddler son was carrying a long red broom and “cleaning”. He had it out in front on the coffee and just off to the side of the table. I am sitting on the couch reading, you can see my arm on the left. It’s my right shoulder with a dark t shirt

My wife thinks the kid cleaning is cute, so she snaps a photo.  She immediately says “woah, that’s weird. There is no broom in this photo. I took the photo to send it to my mom to show him cleaning. But the broom isnt in the photo.”

Now maybe you see a red handled broom, but I sure don’t.  At the bottom of the photo you can see where the bristle part of the broom starts. But there aint no handle.  And the broom was 100% right there as she was talking to me about the photo—-immediately after taking it—- and he 100% had it in his hand in the photo. You can see the shadow of it on the sunny part of the blue blanket.

Jealousy is a Demon

It had been weeks since they had really interacted. Since the night in the larder. Lucanis sat in the kitchen, staring into a cup whose contents went cold ages ago.

This is YOUR fault! Spite sneered in the back of his mind.

He wasn't wrong, Spite. Instead of talking like normal, well-adjusted people… But they were Crows… no Crow is ever well-adjusted. So, instead, Lucanis and Rook avoided each other. If the rest of the team noticed, they at least had the decency not to mention it. Rook kept her distance by never picking him to accompany her on missions.

Lucanis noticed she started spending more time with the necromancer, Emmrich. Lucanis would see them return from the Necropolis, Emmrich being the consummate gentleman and carrying a basket of cuttings from the graveyard, Rook animatedly talking about how there was a dichotomy in certain plants that have the power to both kill and heal. Lucanis felt a sharp to his gut ever time he heard Emmrich refer to her as, ""my dear"".

No. No… she is OURS!

Lucanis had his own distractions. Mostly coffee and Neve. He found it easy to mindlessly flirt with the mage. She was often the only one awake while he was. The often passed the time with playful banter.

Not ours… not ROOK!

His musings where interrupted by a light, familiar laughter, followed by a happy hissing noise. Rook entered in, her lair pulled back from her face by a simple ribbon, her hair falling across her shoulders to her waist, reflecting flashes of deep red in the light. She wore an oversized white blouse, the top several buttons undone, cinched in just under her breasts with an intricately woven cloth belt. Her pants and knee high boots hugged the curves of her legs. She looked… beautiful.

She startled slightly when she noticed him there, watching. Lucanis nodded in a polite greeting. Rook gave a tight smile in return before turning to the skeleton who followed her, carrying a tray filled with an empty tea service. He watched as Rook gently took the tray the skeleton was holding. ""Thank you, Manfred! Can you please let Emmrich know that my salves are almost done setting. I shall be down later tonight to bottle them up for him?""

Lucanis followed the animated skeleton as he happily hissed and scurried out the door. He took a sip of his long cold coffee, grimaced, and, as one does, proceeded to speak without thinking:

""Already planning an evening date with the elder Professor?""

Very rarely did Lucanis experience instant regret. This was one of those times.

Rook's back visibly stiffened. She slowly turned to face him. Lucanis swallowed the bitter liquid in his cup.

""Excuse me?"" Her voice was low… even… dangerous.

Lucanis shrugged, trying to act nonchalant, even as Spite howled internally, ""Just simple observations. An idiot could see that you two are getting closer.""

Rook looked at him with a flat expression, ""not that you deserve any explanation, but Emmrich has been mentoring me about the plants found in the memorial gardens. Not surprising, many are great uses in poisons. He has been quite eager to share his knowledge.""

Lucanis scoffed, ""oh, I'm sure he does.""

""What is your problem, Lucanis?"" Rook demanded. Lucanis slammed his coffee cup on the table and pushed himself up to a standing position.

""You need to go see Teia for some refresher training, Rook. You're a Crow and you can't even tell when an old man is flirting with you? Bah…"" Lucanis spits out.

""Well… he's not. And what does it matter if he is?"" Lucanis inwardly flinched at the withering look Rook gave him. ""You made it perfectly clear where you stand in regards to… us.""

""Rook…""

""No!"" Rook yelled, cutting him off. Lucanis was momentarily taken aback. In the years of knowing her, she had never seen Rook this worked up. She marched up to him and jabbed her finger in his chest. It felt like a stab to his gut. Her eyes glinted in fury and… pain?

She continued, glaring up into his face, ""no. You do not get to judge. Not Emmrich. Not me. While you're in here, flirting with Neve at the drop of a hat, while you rebuff any attempt I made for years? Why? Why her?""

Years? She wanted him for… years?

""She means nothing to me, Rook. She is merely there for a fun distraction"" Lucanis yelled back.

""Lucanis…"" Rook's voice cracks, ""why am I not good enough for you.""

Confusion hits him like a wall. Not good enough? Did she really think that?

""What? No.""

""Then why.""

Lucanis exhaled loudly and lowered his head. He slowly walked towards Rook. He raised his hand to touch her face. He paused and regarded her, silently asking for permission to touch her face. She silently looked at him, her eyes flickering with emotion. The hand he had used in the past to snuff the life from a target now gently tucked an errant strand behind her ear. He moved to cup her cheek.

""It is not you who are not good enough, it is me.""

Lucanis saw her open her mouth to say something.

""Hush, please. Let me explain."" He sighed, his shoulders slumping. ""I don't have any real affection with Neve that goes beyond platonic acquaintanceship. It will never go beyond flirty words. But with you? You know our life, Allona. We as Crows… it's dangerous to become attached. Especially with me. We all have targets on our backs. But me? The Demon of Vyrantium? Grandson of the First Talon? They would get to you to get to me. It would make you a target. And with this?""

He gestured to his head, ""with Spite? No, I can't risk hurting you.""

""But you are… you are hurting me…"" was her quiet reply.

""Mia luca…"" Lucanis made a guttural noise in his throat and brushed his lips against her forehead. It was warm and soft, just like she was. Not like him, with his coldness and jagged edges. He heard her sharp intake of breath.

""Do you know why I call you that? Why you are my light?""

""You said it was because I helped light the way for the perfect strike.""

""Hmm yes, that is true. But it is not the whole truth. You have always been a beacon. How somebody with the same blood as Viago be so… happy and light. Especially in the world we are from? Anybody else's fire would have been diminished or even snuffed. But you? Your light burns brighter than the summer Antivan sun. You even drove away my doom and gloom and let me be… me. Not the Demon of Vyrantium. Not the favorite grandson of the First Talon. But me. Just… Lucanis.""

His slid his fingers down her cheek and to her chin, pulling her chin up to look at him. He was relieved she didn't fight back.

""Do you know how I survived in there? The Ossuary?""

""You were too stubborn and proud to die at the hands of the Venatori."" It was said as a statement, not a question. Lucanis couldn't help but chuckle.

""You know me well. While pride and ego kept me alive, this kept me sane."" With that, he reached into a hidden pocket and pulled out a piece of worn, folded parchment. ""Do you know what this is?""

""Is… is that my letter?""

""Mmhmm. From when Viago thrust you into that damned contract with Varric. When I heard what he had done? Without a chance to say goodbye? Teia had to pull me off him. Trust me, if I could have found ways to send you word… I would have. I lost count of how many times I read this. Memorizing every word, every flick of your script. I always did adore your writing""

He slid one hand slowly down her arm, their eyes locked. When he reached her waist, he spread his fingers, moving his hand to the small of her back and pulling her against him. Softness and curves, hardness and edges.

""I sat in that prison. Your face, in my mind. Being my beacon… my light… mia luca… against that darkness. You kept me sane. It all centered on you. What I thought… what I wanted… what I dared to imagine…""

""Like what?"" Rook… no, not now, right here and now, she was Allona… whispered. ""What did you imagine?""

""This,"" he murmured, before pressing his lips against hers, the hand on her back pressing her firmer against his body, his hand reaching into her hair to pull her closer, deeper into the kiss. After a moment, he broke the kiss, leaning his head to rest against hers. The only sound was the ever crackling fire and their breathing.

""Ah, seems I was mistaken on something.""

""Wha…""

Lucanis silenced her with a kiss.

""The taste of the first kiss. Back at Cafe Petra."" Another kiss. ""Now… now, it's peaches and vanilla cream,"" kiss, ""safe and home.""

He thought he heard her make a soft whining noise before he felt her press her lips against his. He felt her arms wrap around his shoulders, neck, her delicate fingers combing through his hair. Needing no further invitation, Lucanis dragged his hands down her back, over her hips, letting them rest briefly on the back of her thighs, before he used the leverage to lift her legs off the floor. Allona instinctively wrapped her legs around his waist

Lucanis stated to carry her to his room in the larder.

Ours! Spite yelled triumphantly in his head.

'No!' Lucanis mentally yelled back.

He briefly broke the kiss with his luca.

He kicked the door door to the larder shut behind him with his foot.

How many sprays would I have? ( Over 22,000!). How much would my collection cost? ($4k but I damn know I didn’t pay that much, I love a sale!) I asked what my perfumes say about me. I asked what are my most common scent notes.  It was honestly amazing!!!! Highly suggest to play around with it!

Here is some of the info I was able to get!

Do any of these perfumes layer well together?
Layering perfumes can be a fun way to create unique and personalized scents! Based on your collection, you have a variety of perfumes with different notes and moods, so you could certainly experiment with combining them. Here’s a breakdown of some potential pairings and how they might layer well together:
1. Floral & Fruity Combinations
Floral and fruity scents tend to complement each other because they share a natural freshness that can be both vibrant and sweet. Many of your perfumes feature fruity top notes or floral heart notes, making them perfect for layering.
Daisy Eau So Fresh + Gingham Glow
Why it works: Both are fresh, light, and floral, with fruity notes that brighten the overall scent. Daisy Eau So Fresh has notes of wild strawberry and pear, while Gingham Glow offers a citrusy, fruity start. Layering them will create a dynamic and refreshing fragrance that lasts.
Victoria’s Secret Tease Heartbreaker + Flowerbomb Nectar
Why it works: Tease Heartbreaker offers fruity notes of raspberry and pink pepper, while Flowerbomb Nectar has a more sophisticated floral heart with orange blossom. Combining them will amplify the fruity, sweet top notes and create a warmer, deeper floral experience.
2. Gourmand & Floral Combinations
Gourmand fragrances (think vanilla, caramel, and sweet notes) can pair beautifully with florals to create an alluring, comforting scent profile.
Black Opium + My Burberry
Why it works: Black Opium is rich with coffee and vanilla, while My Burberry brings out floral notes of jasmine and rose. The sweet gourmand notes from Black Opium will mix with the florals of My Burberry, creating a warmer, more enveloping scent with a sophisticated edge.
Eilish + Chloe Nomad
Why it works: Eilish has a cozy, vanilla-driven sweetness that pairs wonderfully with the earthy and floral notes of Chloe Nomad, which features oakmoss and a hint of peach. Together, they can create a sensual and comforting yet fresh, slightly woody fragrance.
3. Woody & Fresh Combinations
Woody and fresh fragrances often have a grounding quality and layer well when you want a clean, more natural scent.
Acqua di Gioia + Sunset Hour by Goldfield & Banks
Why it works: Acqua di Gioia offers a refreshing aquatic note, while Sunset Hour has more woody, warm base notes of amber and sandalwood. Layering these will give you a balanced, fresh scent with a subtle, warm depth perfect for daytime wear.
Chloe Nomad + Idole by Lancôme
Why it works: Chloe Nomad’s earthy oakmoss and fresh notes pair nicely with Idole’s modern floral composition. The combination would offer a bright, crisp freshness with a bit of depth, making it a versatile layering choice for both daytime and evening wear.
4. Sweet & Spicy Combinations
If you like to add a bit of spice or sweetness, some of your perfumes, like Tease Cream Cloud and Good Girl Blush, are great for layering to create a warm, inviting scent.
Good Girl Blush + Tease Cream Cloud
Why it works: Good Girl Blush has soft floral and fruity notes, while Tease Cream Cloud offers warm vanilla and coconut, adding a delicious sweetness. Together, they’ll create a rich, spicy-sweet scent that feels both elegant and cozy.
Idole Aura + Tease Heartbreaker
Why it works: Idole Aura offers fresh floral notes with an amber undertone, while Tease Heartbreaker brings out a playful fruitiness. Together, the layers would offer an inviting and slightly fruity floral scent with depth and warmth, perfect for romantic evenings.
5. Citrus & Fresh Combinations

Beachwalk + Gingham Glow
Why it works: Both fragrances are fresh, bright, and perfect for layering in summer. Beachwalk offers a light, beachy floral with notes of lemon and coconut, while Gingham Glow is citrusy and floral with a soft, clean finish. Layering these will create a refreshing, sunny scent.

Why it works: Nest Wild Poppy is fresh and fruity, with notes of pomegranate and orange blossom. Pairing it with Tease Heartbreaker will enhance the fruity vibe and add a touch of floral sophistication. It’s perfect for daytime wear when you want to feel fresh and uplifting.
Tips for Layering Fragrances:
Start Light: If you’re unsure about how two fragrances will mix, start by layering lighter scents first. You can always adjust by adding more of the second fragrance if needed.
Match Scent Families: Layering within the same scent family (floral + floral, gourmand + gourmand) tends to work best, but feel free to experiment with contrasting notes (sweet + woody, fruity + fresh) for a unique effect.
Top vs. Base: Apply the lighter fragrance as the ""top"" scent (the one you’ll spritz first) and the heavier, more base-heavy fragrance second. This will allow the top note to shine through before the deeper notes emerge.
Skin Chemistry: Keep in mind that perfumes can smell slightly different depending on your skin’s chemistry, so test your layering combination on your skin for a few hours before committing to a full wear.
My Favorite Layering Suggestions for You:
Gingham Glow + Daisy Eau So Fresh: Fresh, light, and fruity for a breezy, warm-weather vibe.
Black Opium + Eilish: Sweet, rich, and comforting—ideal for evenings when you want a more seductive, enveloping scent.
Chloe Nomad + My Burberry: Earthy and floral with a sophisticated edge, perfect for day-to-night wear.
Tease Heartbreaker + Flowerbomb Nectar: A sweet and floral combo that creates an irresistible, romantic fragrance.

How many sprays would it take me to finish all of my perfumes
To calculate how many sprays it would take to finish all of your perfumes, we can use some basic information and assumptions based on your perfume collection. Here’s the step-by-step process to estimate the total number of sprays it would take to finish all your perfumes.
General Assumptions for Calculation:
Average spray amount: One spray is generally considered to be about 0.1 ml.
Volume of your bottles: You’ve mentioned a variety of bottle sizes, ranging from 30 ml to 150 ml (and more).
Number of sprays per bottle: The number of sprays in each bottle depends on the size of the bottle and the spray amount per use.
Here’s how to calculate the total sprays per bottle:
Formula:
Number of sprays = (Bottle Size in ml) ÷ (Spray size in ml)
For example, if a bottle is 100 ml, it would have around 1,000 sprays (100 ÷ 0.1 = 1,000).
Let’s Calculate for a Few Example Bottles:
1. Daisy Eau So Fresh 4.2 oz (125 ml)
Sprays = 125 ml ÷ 0.1 ml = 1,250 sprays
2. Yves Saint Laurent Libre EDP (90 ml)
Sprays = 90 ml ÷ 0.1 ml = 900 sprays
3. Chloé Nomad EDP 1.6 oz (50 ml)
Sprays = 50 ml ÷ 0.1 ml = 500 sprays
4. Coach Wild Rose EDP (50 ml)
Sprays = 50 ml ÷ 0.1 ml = 500 sprays
5. Marc Jacobs Eau So Fresh Sunshine 75 ml
Sprays = 75 ml ÷ 0.1 ml = 750 sprays
6. Mason Margiela Replica By the Fireplace (100 ml)
Sprays = 100 ml ÷ 0.1 ml = 1,000 sprays
Total Sprays for a Few Bottles in Your Collection:
Let’s take a few examples from your collection and add up the total sprays.
Daisy Eau So Fresh (125 ml): 1,250 sprays
YSL Libre (90 ml): 900 sprays
Chloé Nomad (50 ml): 500 sprays
Coach Wild Rose (50 ml): 500 sprays
Marc Jacobs Eau So Fresh Sunshine (75 ml): 750 sprays
Mason Margiela Replica By the Fireplace (100 ml): 1,000 sprays
Total sprays for these six perfumes:
1,250 + 900 + 500 + 500 + 750 + 1,000 = 4,900 sprays
 
Estimate for Your Entire Collection:
To get a rough estimate for all of your perfumes, I would need the volume of each perfume in your collection, but based on a rough calculation (given that many of your bottles are around 50-100 ml), let's estimate the total for your entire collection.
Assume the average bottle size across your collection is 75 ml.
If you have, say, 30 perfumes (just an estimate based on your list), the total volume would be roughly 2,250 ml (30 perfumes × 75 ml).
Number of sprays for 2,250 ml of perfume:
2,250 ml ÷ 0.1 ml = 22,500 sprays.
So, it would take around 22,500 sprays to finish all the perfumes in your collection, assuming average bottle sizes and spray amounts.
How long would it take to finish your perfumes?
If you use 3 sprays per day (which is typical for daily wear):
22,500 sprays ÷ 3 sprays/day = 7,500 days.
7,500 days ÷ 365 days/year ≈ 20.5 years to finish your entire collection!
 
How much does my whole collection cost
To estimate the cost of your entire perfume collection, I would need to provide an average price range for each perfume, based on their retail prices, and then calculate the total cost based on the number of bottles you have. Keep in mind that perfume prices can fluctuate depending on the retailer, region, and any ongoing sales or promotions. The prices I list here are based on standard retail prices for full-size bottles.

1gtljva,https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/1gtljva/clarification_about_broadcom_bcm94360cd_wifibt/,Clarification about Broadcom bcm94360CD Wifi/BT Support - Ventura,"Hey I have looked this up for past 2 days but haven't seemed to find a very clear answer on it -

I have a Broadcom BCM94360CD (802.11 A/B/G/N/AC with Bluetooth 4.0) I purchased back in 2020 from OSXWIFI that has done everything I need it to - I believe what I have is this [exact one](https://www.osxwifi.com/product/pc-hackintosh-apple-broadcom-bcm94360cd-802-11-a-b-g-n-ac-with-bluetooth-4-0/) (though I bought mine on Amazon and looks like OSXWIFI no longer sells on Amazon so the product page is gone - however the title and product details are basically identical to what I bought and it looks the same, etc so safe to assume thats the one in my Hackintosh ) 

My System Information on MacOS mentions my Network Card Vendor ID is Apple so I believe its one taken right out of an old Mac. I do know is everything works without any Kexts or specific settings for Wi-fi or bluetooth and has ever since I set it up and built my Hackintosh. Ie: went from Big Sur  -> Monterey just now without issue. Handoff, Universal Clipboard, etc all works like it does on an actual Mac etc. 

My issue is that

1-  [Dorantia Wireless Guide ](https://dortania.github.io/Wireless-Buyers-Guide/unsupported.html)doesn't mention anything about the support for the bcm94360CD in ***Ventura*** (or Sonoma for that matter but I'll cross that bridge when/if I get there ) - unless I am missing it?

2 - Most of my searches about this comes up with people using chips similar to the BCM94360CD but not that exact one I have  - and many of the results I'm finding involve people having issues that I just have never had with my Hackintosh ever since I built in 2020. I just can't find someone saying confirming if a native apple bcm94360CD chip will work in Ventura. I keep seeing Fenvi T919 and I don't know what this has to do with the chips either lol - maybe am missing something here - is the type of PCI-E adaptor going to be a problem? I feel like this Fenvi thing is throwing me off since I thought the chips in many of these advertised Fenvi's are just BCM94360CDs with an adaptor lol. 

  
TL;DR - whats the status of these native BCM94360CD cards for Ventura? What does Fenvi T919 have to do with it? Perhaps he one I have is in in fact incompatible with newer versions of MacOS?

  
Basic specs of my system below (I doubt you need more for the case of wifi/bluetooth but let me know)

SMBIOS: iMac19,1

CPU: i7-9700 (Coffee Lake) 

Motherboard: ASUS TUF Z390-PLUS GAMING (WI-FI)

1gtljix,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultingph/comments/1gtljix/how_to_ask_a_friend_about_an_utang/,How to ask a friend about an utang?,"Hi I wanna hear your thoughts and what I should do with this. For context: I had a previous loan which I shared with a friend. We split the amount by each month of how much they would pay. He provided for the first month, then half for the second month. He stopped paying for the third month since he had an exam and stopped working for the time being. I understood and was patient with it. Now, his part of the loan should've ended paying by October however since he stopped paying me I continued to consult him about it after his exams. He told me he'll pay this November on sweldo day but I got no word from him. I also don't get any updates like at least reassure me that he will pay me or on what day because I feel like a desperate person always asking him about it (which I don't want to come out as). Also my financial situation isn't that good as well and I also need the money.

It feels as if they are not prioritizing their responsibility with me since I see them sometimes travelling to cities or having coffee. I don't want to think this but it's difficult to go into people when they don't seem to take the accountability.

Do I keep asking them about it? Should I just wait? ",0,1731871943.0,adultingph,4,0.5,False

So I don't know if this is entirely accurate because I bought the remaster of Arizona sunshine one, and in the starting area, you can find a picture of a dog, and an overdue bill that says ""mr. T"" on it It has a full name, but it's blocked out by a Coffee stain. After you play the game a little bit more after a big fight the main character starts rambling how he'd like to thank all these people for getting to where he is, and one of the names includes is his dog. Keep in mind he doesn't say a specific name, He just says ""my dog"". Shortly after that, you get to an area right before the radio station, and it's like a small town with some houses. One of those houses if you look in the mailbox, it has the same overdue bill letter in it. It also has a doghouse outside of it that has the name ""Buddy"" on top of it. This isn't my question, but I'm a little confused on why the key in the dog bowl leads to A room with a bunch of cat pictures. I just thought that was pretty interesting and wanted to share it. I couldn't find any videos about the lore anywhere and this was just a tidbit that I Found. But my question was what happened between the first game and the second game? The First game ends with a helicopter picking the main character up, but the second game begins with him in a trailer?

My thought is sitting down at a coffee shop, brewery or public library and say I’ll be there for a certain block of time and invite anyone to join if interested. Most likely it would be just me to start but ideally, if I’m consistent, people would eventually join and we could form a nice little group to kind of cross-pollinate ideas, players, share tips and systems, etc.

Has anyone done this from scratch? It’s sort of working backwards from the usual method of starting a group of players and then building from there, I know, but I moved to a new state a couple years ago and my groups are fully online now because of that, so I’m just trying to think of some ways to build community near me.

But not always? Sometimes id drink it and it was fine... or only a mild change. I'd have some beliefs that were kinda weird, would drink caffine, they would go away some.  (I also thought it made me feel depressed or get really doomy and gloomy).

right now: coffee seemingly makes me feel hyper? maybe a headache. Usually I don't feel any difference from coffee but right now I just feel kinda elated. Any spiritual stuff I experienced or really weird thoughts just stopped for the most part. This happens occasionally. I'll get into massively weird beliefs and then, eventually, its like a clock resets and those all stop. I stop thinking they hold water entirely, sometimes(like now) have a really great mood. Also have been really irratable, more than usual. I feel fine otherwise though, occasionally getting spikes where I feel great. Apparently migraines can do that. I should see a doc about it. Feels like all the weird stuff is gone, but ik chances are if its something it can and will (and has) come back. Like a month ago I momentarily stopped believing in any weird things like spirituality but it didnt last very long and afterwards I stopped entirely. In the past I remember having times where I was more prone to being into religion than other times, seemingly for no reason.

Also just feeling like jumping around more, more prone to just tapping out a rythm singing at random, being all super happy (likely from coffee)

1gtl6me,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSDD/comments/1gtl6me/questioning_if_i_had_osddosdd1a/,Questioning if I had OSDD/OSDD-1A.,"This account is sorta like an alt because I have irl family nearly following me on everything I have. But anyway, I've been questioning having OSDD-1A (and or just OSDD) for a while. I will say that I am still a teenager (16FTM) and I've been trying to figure out mental issues for a while now. (suspected AuADHD) 

IDk how to word these posts, but from stuff I've looked up abt 1a it lines up to how I've experienced a lot of my life, but I've had my mom mention I have small to extreme personality shifts, I barely remember acting like these personality's, or in fact I barely remember most of my life, and when I do I have to question if it really happened because of near consent derealization + depersonalization episodes I go through even when my life doesn't seem horrible.

And then on top of that, I have been told I've acted really out of character or have woken up to doing something I don't remember. Like today, I don't remember waking up at 9 am, making myself a full breakfast with a pot of coffee and apparently pulling out my own hair in the bathroom. When I looked back into my dm's with friends and partners, my speaking pattern was completely off, I referred to myself in the third person, and using weird broken up sentences to talk to people. 

My mom keeps saying I might be Bipolar because of these extreme shifts in personality but its just, I don't remember doing anything unless its anything stressful, like school, a traumatic event or just something stressful in all, I witness and suffer all of the episodes, the panic attacks and extreme delusions.. I don't remember anything else from my childhood, friends, extended family, I look at old pictures of me from when I was a kid and it feels like I'm staring at someone else entirely different. Like I am only a vessel for all of these issues. I sometimes don't even remember basic info (blood type, age, birthday, full name etc)

But on the other memory Issues, I looked back on more dm's and there's even more stuff, I forgot things like the name of my own animals (I've had them for over 3-4 years now) and also have mentioned being unfamiliar with the house im in and contently bumping into things. But the issue I think I end up having that tells me that I don't have OSDD/DID is just; 

Oh well you know all of your trauma from ur childhood up until now (I can barely remember the ages that it happened to me, if you asked I'll say all of the worst happened between 4-12, and you have no inner voices, or you can't completely tell apart a alter from kinnie or I slip up and use I/Me/Myself instead of /We/Our/Ourselves, or that I go months without apparently 'shifting' (I've had times where I've acted line for line of a character from a show as a kid and now, having their personality, speaking patterns, liked and hated foods etc) 

Its just all puzzling, and im scared to tell my partners or my friends who are systems (apart from one person) because im scared if I come out that I might have OSDD they'll give reasons to why I don't and then I'll just shut down more then likely from it. 

TLDR: I don't remember anything in my but my traumas and barely basic info about myself, and I do things thats out of character and I don't remember doing.",2,1731870991.0,OSDD,0,1.0,False

I’m 20, M and dating just flat out feels impossible. In fact it’s not even dating in itself, cause in order to do that you have to find a date first. And I can’t seem to even do that. In person, online, etc it just doesn’t seem to go well

Try to approach people in public? Can’t do that anymore. If you even bother to try you get called a creep, get the most disgusting look, the “I have a boyfriend”, or someone else intervenes before you can get close enough to ask. I already have enough social anxiety when trying to ask, the last I need is any of the above. Just ruins whatever confidence I do have, and I’m sure there’s many others that can agree

Try to be approachable? Hahaha now that’s funny. Guys are meant to be the first to approach. And that’s despite that women no longer want to be approached or at least the vocal minority. But despite this I do try to keep a smile on my face, off my phone, and look approachable.
I don’t think I’m the ugliest guy in the world. I’m relatively fit (134 Ibs), 6ft, dress clean and attempt to match my clothing. Clean, well done up shorter hair (when not hidden under my cowboy hat). Clean face too. Deodorant & cologne… do I need to say more?

Going into the approaching, where are guys supposed to approach women anymore? It seems like everywhere is becoming a don’t approach me there anymore type of place. Out shopping at like target - no. The gym - also no. The coffee shop - nope. Out on a walk around the park, or town, etc - just forget it (although that could be seen as sketchy, so understandable). Oh and never approach her and ask for a number while she’s working… like what. Where does that leave?

Before anyone says the bar/ raves/ clubs - I’m not looking for a one nighter. Not looking to let loose and dance with someone for 3 minutes, I’m looking for a relationship. And while this is projecting the bar scene woman PROBABLY aren’t the ones you want a LTR with.

Now I personally am from a more rural location in Minnesota. So my options are always going to be limited especially as I choose not to go to college, and work (for the most part) by myself. So those aren’t options for me. I’m not of legal age to drink, and if I was (I’m close too) I wouldn’t drink anyways. The bar scene isn’t for me. Target & the gym are off limits, and I don’t have any book stores near me so… 

So what does that leave… oh yeah how could i forget - DATING APPS. F#%K|*G Dating apps. Absolutely hate them. The ghosting, no likes back, very few matches, being scammed, or that half the users are bots. That’s without mentioning that apps like Facebook just ignore my distance preference and match me with people 896 miles away. They all want one thing - my money. None want to make real connections. I refuse to use them anymore 

So what do I do. I’m lost. Like how am I or anyone in similar situations supposed to date anymore!? All advice appreciated, thank you for coming to my ted talk

1gtl201,https://www.culturecrawl.ca,Culture Crawl Ends Today,"Hey lovely Vancouverites! I’m not sure how many people have made it out to Culture Crawl this year, but as a ten year participating artist, I want to encourage you to get out into the neighbourhood to walk around, explore buildings and see art! A lot of artists in smaller studios got skunked by the rainstorm yesterday as everyone went to the big buildings (which is fantastic!) but the little pocket neighbourhoods with smaller studios have lots to show off too. 

If you’ve never attended Crawl - which is a free event - you might expect that artists will be pressuring you for sales which is the furthest thing from the truth. We mostly want to show off our work and talk about art and maybe show you how we do the cool thing we do. We want people to learn about the artists working in their community, what we make, and our awesome spaces. Most  of us expect you will walk in, look around, and maybe stop for a chat. (We’re not salesmen, anyway). 

It’s supposed to be a rain free afternoon, so grab a coffee or a can  and head to our neighbourhoods! The participating studios are located from Victoria Drive to Abbott Street and from 1st avenue to the waterfront.  I’m at the northeast corner of the crawl map (E11 kitty corner from the JJ Bean on powell street) and would love to say hi to some fellow redditors. I still have some print programs, two rooms filled with art in an amazing old building with a view of the trains, and hope you’ll drop by, so I can tell you who else to check out! The crawl map can be found on their website - culturecrawl dot ca and everyone open will have signboards out.

Stop in and say hi when you see one - more than 500 artists are open today and we’d love to meet you in our workshops.",18,1731870655.0,vancouver,3,0.88,False

1gtl0oa,https://i.redd.it/e6ezdvvbgi1e1.jpeg,"Alchemist’s Cabinet, 1000 pcs, Eeboo, 23” x 23”","I usually love Eeboo puzzles. I find in general that there are no false fits, the fit is tight enough so that rearranging sections is possible, and I find images that I really like. I don’t use the puzzle picture on the box as a guide so I do a lot of rearranging as I figure out what sections go where. I love the image of this puzzle. A little eerie/spooky.

36 m(asian) here.. I have been overweight for last few years and recently started working on weight loss with good balanced diet. I was able to reduce about 50 Lbs in about 3.5 months with good balanced diet, doing 25-30K steps per day with 40-60 mins elliptical in gym. 
After so long, I recently got my yearly checkup done. Everything else was near perfect except cholesterol levels. My god, it was a shock and a bummer. My cholesterol was 331 with ldl at 267 and hdl at 38.
I am really perplexed by this, I have been eating chia seeds, mustard seeds, dairy at 10%, coffee, salads 3-5 times a week with lots of veggies, chickpeas, oats etc which upon reading I found reduces ldl but still that was not the case for me. 
I did eat my dinner prior to test at 7 pm in the night before going to test at 9.30 AM in mrng(effectively 14 hrs fasting). What could I be doing wrong? I do eat some pizzas and fried chicken here and there but nothing out of ordinary. Any insights will be appreciated. Thank you in advance.",1,1731870477.0,Cholesterol,4,1.0,False

4. That poor middle daughter, she rarely shows her. Only the eldest and the screamer. 
5. Her poor pussy whipped husband. How does he stand the attitude? She’s so condescending to him. She should be kissing his ass because he’s still with her.
6. She claims she dropped all the weight because she stopped drinking. Yeah, okay. 🙄
7. Her so called friends in Indiana (or wherever she went) didn’t even seem to like her and they don’t watch her videos.

9. She is rude in her comments. It’s not necessary to be mean to the people who are watching and commenting on your videos! She can’t handle any differing opinion or ideas, only wants ass kissing.

I don’t see how I’m going to survive it feels so wrong,"It’s been nearly 3 months and I’m not getting any better, even though the shock has worn off a bit I still feel empty inside. We were together 3.5 years. We lived together. He couldn’t give me what I wanted and now I don’t even want anything, I just want him. 

He didn’t want to make an effort with my family or friends, he said I worked too much and didn’t spend enough time with him, he didn’t want to spend any money or time away from home to go on holidays together or make memories, he was mean and rude and impossible to have a disagreement with. He was so confrontational, not just to me but to whoever we were in company with. It felt like I was losing parts of myself and my light by being with him. He tried therapy, it helped with some issues (his jealousy and control mainly), but other things just kept coming up and he never stuck at it long enough to see any lasting change. We’ve broken up 3 times now. All signs pointed to us not being right for each other. 

But I can’t stop thinking about his kind soul that I know was there underneath his stress, his gentle nature which I saw every day. The way he kissed me a thousand times and the way he hugged me so tight. The way he made me laugh and the way we laughed together, so hard and so pure that I felt like a child again. He took care of me and helped me with so many things, he made me endless cups of tea even though I would always forget about them and let them go cold. He cuddled me every single night and I never once doubted that he loved me, I still don’t. 

I wonder now if I’ll ever find a love like him again. Our life together was good, our home was wonderful and safe, we just disagreed on so much. It hurts me to think that maybe I should have tried just a little bit longer, or changed my own perspective to fit with him more. Maybe he was right. Maybe I didn’t give him enough. Maybe I focused too much on others and not enough on our life together. 

I didn’t want to lose the last few years of my 20s stuck at home with my boyfriend and losing other things in my life. But now that I’m alone, those other things and other people don’t make me happy. I was unhappy with him too, a lot of the time, but at least I didn’t feel so alone. Our life was so good. He is a good person. I’m so confused and it’s just too late now for anything to change. My family hates him and his family probably hate me. I don’t want to hurt him by reaching out, especially when I don’t think anything can come of it. I don’t want to just meet him for a coffee. I want to hug him again, I want to be back in our house together again, I want to hear him making silly jokes again, I want to listen to him talk about his favourite things, I want to plan our life together, I want to marry him like I had dreamed of, I want to have his children and watch him be the father I know he could have been. We had such a bright future and I just extinguished it on a random Friday evening in August. I haven’t been able to write about it or journal since then because it’s too painful but I can’t keep it inside me anymore. I don’t know if I can survive this.

1gtkv5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1gtkv5x/3_month_old_feeding_problems_desperate/,3 Month Old Feeding Problems - Desperate ,"My baby who is 13 weeks now has major feeding issues and continue to drop in weight percentile. Desperate and at a loss on how to help her. Full details of what's going on. Would love insight or advice from anyone with a similar story.

Exclusively breastfed and at about 3 weeks we began to get a decent amount of spit up (a lot of chunky undigested milk). Tried not to over think things but then at 4 weeks she became super fussy constantly popping off the breast screaming and wrenching in pain. I was attributing it to my fast let down and the dr suggested we try bottle feeding for a bit to see if it was any better but she was fussy with the bottle as well, clicking and taking in a lot of air. Was referred to a pediatric dentist at 6 weeks and we had four oral ties released by laser. From there started working with a lactation consultant who specialized in ties and was able to show us new bottle feeding techniques as well as taking her to see a myofacial release specialist and for about a month we were in a decently good place getting her to eat about 25-27 ounces of pumped breast milk a day with relative ease and she was maintaining her new 10th percentile growth curve.

Simultaneously while all this was happening we had mucous diapers with specs of blood and a transient face rash when eating so suspected food allergies. I've gone on a total elimination diet of top 10 allergens which seems to have made these two things better. 

At 12 weeks everything began falling apart again. She eats an ounce or two then just starts refusing the bottle and screaming in pain. Her stools seemed to have slowed down so I've tried everything from massage to the windy etc to help her but nothing seems to make much of a difference. She is still going once a day and it's still soft/ runny when she does so the doc was not over concerned about this. Two nights ago she was straining so hard to poop she projectiled spit up everywhere and there was yellow bile in it so I decided to take her to the ER. X-ray did not show any blockages. They also did an ultrasound to check for pyloric stenosis, she refused to drink the glucose drink so they were only able to take measurements which said ""borderline"". We went home atleast knowing that she did not seem to have any immediate emergency problems. The next morning she was back to screaming and refusing the bottle so I called the pediatrician to be seen. Her weight has dropped now to the 6th percentile. He said the ""borderline"" ultrasound report did not really mean anything and that if she's not projectile vomiting with most feeds she does not have pyloric stenosis. At this point they have started her on liquid Pepcid twice a day to see if that makes a difference with her comfort while eating. We are a day in a half in now and not seeing much of a difference yet.

I'm truly at a loss for what to do. We have an appt at Boston children's with GI in two weeks but that feels like lifetime away when I have a baby who will barley eat. When not trying to feed her she is an overall happy baby but this is consuming our entire life right now. Idk if I should cut more foods... coffee maybe? Finally try formula? Just so tired and stressed and at a loss on how to help her. Thank you so much to anyone who has read all of this.

* Meet a friend, indoors. Coffee, food. (3h max)
* Shopping for anything I need.
* Reading (but how long is normal?)
* Trying out a new recipe (but 1-2h max)
* Video games (becoming annoying already and I've just started, so may not continue)
* Jigsaw puzzles (good ones are expensive, so 1x per month)
* Gym (mostly done during the week, so 1h at weekend)
* Watching series/films (but how long is normal?)

I'm maxed out on studying and learning so I can't pick up a new hobby. I'm not interested in crafts, I've tried a few of them and I just don't like the idea of buying things to mess around with things to then have to store said things. I am also very burnt out on travel (have had to do quite a lot for work in recent years) so learning new languages or visiting new countries I simply don't have the willpower for.

I'm aware as a person without children that I have a lot of free time, and it seems like a first-world problem, but I really have an issue with feeling like I'm at home when it's those colder months, and I'm forced to stay indoors a lot more. I  start to resent being there and having the weekly and weekend cleaning schedule hanging over my head every week, and various maintenance to do around the place. I'm looking for ways to connect with the idea that this place is a nice place to be, and that means finding nice things to do.

What do you all do on weekends, and what is it that makes you feel at home in the place you live?

1gtkst9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lucanismancers/comments/1gtkst9/fanfic_that_slow_burn_feeling/,Fanfic- That Slow Burn Feeling,"Author note: I'm living vicariously through stitched together cutscenes since i lack a way to play this game.  But DA has always been my favorite series. 

This is a female Rook.  Allona De Riva, younger cousin of Viago.  She grew up with Lucanis, though still several years younger (6-8 ish).  So they have... history.

This is my take on the damned scene in the larder. I have a follow up if you are interested.


Rook sighed as she pulled part of her hair into a messy bun, leaving half of her waist-length hair flowing freely over her shoulders. It had been a week since Zara's death. Rook didn't know which hurt Lucanis more: the chance of the killing strike being ripped from his grasp, or Spite showing up and Illario calling him a danger to his family.

There was an unspoken agreement that Lucanis needed time to process. Rook recognized it on the few… very few… occasions when they worked together on contracts. Usually, it was Lucanis who would seek her out, though. She softly smiled, remembering the nights the held quiet conversation in dimly lit rooms, nibbling on the small trays of meat and cheese Lucanis would prepare for them. Lucanis often told her that she was the only person he knew wouldn't judge him for his words. She would let him vent and rant, offering sympathetic noises where appropriate. She only offered advice if he explicitly asked.

Rook dragged her hands over her face. She aught to go check on him. Pushing herself up off the couch in her chambers, she made her way down to the kitchen.

She walked into the kitchen and towards the larder and noticed Taash, who was looking at Lucanis. Lucanis was sitting on his cot, back rigid, eyes glowing purple, a magenta purple aura floating around him.

Taash looked at Rook and said bluntly, ""demon's back.""

""I don't think he ever leaves, actually."" She replied as moved to stand next to the qunari dragon hunter. Taash turned her head towards Rook.

""Then he's acting weird.""

They were interrupted by Lucanis.

""Smells like… melon and woodsmoke!"" Well, they were interrupted by a voice coming from Lucanis. This voice was low, guttural. It lacked the suave, accented voice that could sound like a threat or a gentle purr at a notice that Rook enjoyed.

""Hey! No! No, sit your ass back down."" Taash yelled at Lucanis… Spite… both? Maker, this was complicated. Lucanis's figured had pushed itself up off the cot and now stood standing, its face focused on Rook.

Rook put a hand on Taash's shoulder. ""I'll handle this."" Taash opened her mouth to try and argue. Rook raised a hand, cutting her off. ""Make sure eluvian room is blocked?"" With a glance back at Lucanis, Taash nodded and walked out the door.

""Now. We get to talk.""

""You must be Spite. I would say it's a pleasure to meet you, but in our current situation, that would be a lie.""

Spite laughed. A bitter cackle that sent the hairs on the back of Rook's neck to stand.

""Oh, I like you. He likes you. This is why. You and I. Need to talk""

This was not part of of her agenda today. Rook crossed her arms over her chest and said, ""the only thing to talk about is getting you out of Lucanis's body""

Spite howled and hissed, clenching Lucanis's fists in frustration. ""No! Lucanis. Made a deal. He hasn't kept.""

Rook narrowed her eyes, ""what deal?"" Crows don't go and blindly make deals. Especially ones they don't plan to fulfill. Especially with demons.

""Break our chains. Kill. Escape our prison. And live.""

Rook blinked in surprise. ""Isn't that what happened? I mean, I literally broke Lucanis out of the Ossuary. You seem to be the one keeping him now""

""No! I want out!""

""Out? To where?"" Rook spread her arms in exasperation. ""Nowhere is safe for a possessed man.""

""No. No! He promised! Tell him! Make him!"" Spite had Lucanis hunched over, yelling, screaming, acting like a petulant child who wasn't given the last sweet. The purple aura around his body intensified. For a moment, Rook didn't know whether to reach out to try and touch him or to turn around and run. Fortunately, she didn't have to make a decision. At that moment, Lucanis's face visibly grimaced, and the purple aura suddenly vanished.

""Rook?"" The dark gray eyes that reminded her of the Treviso skies during a storm looked up at her, blinking in brief confusion.

""You were sleepwalking."" Rook gently replied, trying to train her voice to hide any shakiness from dealing with Spite. Lucanis shot her a look.

""Spite was sleepwalking. What if he tried to leave. What if he tried to…""

Rook firmly interrupted him, ""he didn't go anywhere. Nothing happened. Look. You're here. I'm here. Spite is… wherever Spite is when he isn't taking over.

Lucanis sighed loudly and pinched the bridge of his nose, ""I didn't want you to see that. Again.""

Rook looked at the floor and slowly looked up to Lucanis's face. He looked so tired. So worn. So… broken. She hated seeing him like this. But there was nobody else she would rather be here for multiple reasons.

""Nothing I'm seeing makes me want to look away."" She countered in a soft voice. Lucanis looked at her, his head tilting slightly, eyes half closed. She knew that look. He was analyzing her. Reading her. She held his gaze. His eyes eyes softened and a faint smile played on his lips.

""How have you always been able to do that?"" Lucanis murmured.

""Do what?""

""Break apart my perfectly gathered clouds of doom."" Lucanis shook his head, as if trying to clear his thoughts. ""You deserve better than to deal with my mess.""

Rook couldn't help but roll her eyes as she crossed her arms and leaned against a wall. ""You have known me since I was 5, when I was sent to live with my aunt in the House Di Riva. 25 fucking years. You should know better than anybody that I hate, hate, being told what I do or do not deserve."" Rook closed her eyes and took some deep breaths to calm down. The details of why she was the orphan charge of the Di Riva house was well known amongst the Crows. Early in her training, other fledglings tried to mock her parentage, saying she didn't deserve to be a Crow. That shifted to saying she didn't deserve so-called special treatment for becoming Viago's protege when he discovered her aptitudes for poisons.

""Lucanis, you are more than what you're going through."" Rook let her eyes wander over his form as he slowly walked towards her. ""And you wear it well.""

Rook inhaled sharply through her nose as he put a hand on the on the wall by her head, letting it support his weight as he leaned in towards her. The scent of spices and coffee filled her nose. Rook couldn't figure out if they were from the jars lining the wall several feet away or…

""Lucanis…"" she murmured.

""This isn't a good idea.""

""oh… you know me… sometimes a bad idea is better."" Rook chuckled, suddenly feeling nervous.

""You always did like walking a little too close to the edge, mia luca."" Lucanis moved closer.

Rook lowered her eyes as she reached out a hand, a finger resting on his chest between the dangling chain on his collar. ""So do you,"" she countered in a whisper.

""At least I know I'm doing you. You… I have lost count how many times I had to keep you from falling.""

Rook closed her eyes. She could feel him leaning closer.

""And what… what if I want to?""

""To what?""

She could feel him press against her. He was so close that she felt his breath on her lips.

""To fall,"" she whispered.

A beat passed and a frustrated grunt came from Lucanis. He leaned his forehead against hers. Rook opened her eyes as she she felt him push away.

""I… I need to clear my mind."" He held up his hands, as if silently begging for forgiveness, ""Excuse me.""

Rook silently watched him walk away, leaving her with the smell of coffee and spices and her heart shattering in thousands of little pieces",3,1731870006.0,Lucanismancers,3,1.0,False

**1) Lara Ravel**

Not counting Eva Yan, Lara is the only person that would allow the Bachelor to sleep at her place despite her having known him for less than 2 days. And when you play as Bachelor she would provide you an alpha tablet in every single day. Its not much but during the time where most people hoard resources for themselves, her kindness is shining beacon in a cesspool of chaos. Furthermore in all routes, her home has a cabinet that can be used to store your protagonist's stuffs.

**2) Var**

This guy allows you to take stuffs from his home and use the drawers in his rooms to store your stuffs. In Haruspex route, you can trade organs with him for bandages & tourniquets. In Bachelor route, he would give you 50k for persuading his adopted daughter to meet him. Its a sad thing that he died early in the game.

**3) Andrey Stamatin**

In all routes, this guy has a bar that sells you coffee daily. And coffee drinks reduce your exhaustion and help you stay awake for all day so Andrey Stamatin's bar is undoubtedly a place to visit in every morning. In Haruspex route, he would give bullets & shotgun in exchange for herbs. In Changeling route, he would offer only Twyrine Extracts in return for the herbs. Nevertheless he will always have something useful for any of the 3 protagonists

**4) Bad Grief**

If you are playing as the Bachelor and want to get good weapons asap (knife to backstab muggers in Warehouse mission & rifle to snipe arsonists & Var), Bad Grief is your guy. However in Haruspex & Changeling route, you would not need to buy any weapon from him to have an easy time in killing foes that appear in your quests. Then there is the fact that his stuffs are expensive. Nevertheless any of the 3 protagonist can still find him useful due to him being a reliable source of a quantity of bullets.

**B Tier**

**5) Notkin**

He sells you map of infected districts in exchange for either money or crowbars. And by giving Notkin crowbars. you save about 10k money.

**6) Vlad The Younger**

Basically an inferior version of Notkin. When you play as the Bachelor, you have to pay him 1000 in every morning to get an updated map of infected districts.

**7) Stanislav Rubin**

His place has a microscope that can be used to examine blood samples. This allows the Bachelor to complete certain quests without having to spend a lot of time walking back to Stillwater to use the microscope in his room.

**C Tier**

**8) Alexander Saburov**

All 3 protagonist can use the drawer in a bedroom of his home to store their stuffs.

**9) Aspity**

Only Haruspex can have access to the chest in her bedroom that can be used to store a limited amount of objects,

**10) Eva Yan**

As the Bachelor, you can sleep in 2 places: Eva's home & Lara's home. And Lara's home is simply the better choice due to her home being close to many stores.

There's one really nice gas station in town and a lot of the workers go there to fill up on breakfast gas and coffee in the morning. I've been going in and they have a nice system where you order on a screen. You don't even talk to people. They make your food you pick it up on the counter and then they're self check out. So I love it because early in the morning. Who wants to talk to people anyways? So I go in to mourn this morning and it being Sunday.  I walk up to the screen. I fill out my order. I see, there's food available that I want to eat but some woman behind the counter says to me. We don't start serving till 7 Ami ignore her and go get my coffee. She continues to try to yell at me. That they're not serving till 7 I look around for a signage because i know in the past I've been served at 6 I go up to the cash register and there's a guy working the register. And I say, do you display your hours of operation for food service? And he says no, we do not and I said.  The food's already prepared. Why aren't she selling it today? He's like we don't start serving food till 7 and I said, well, I was in here several times buying food after 6, and here's like oh yeah, well, today is Sunday and I said, well, can I speak to your manager? He said she won't be until Monday morning. I said can I have her phone number? Will you write it down here? And I gave him the slip of paper that the consul had printed out for me confirming my order. He wrote her number down and asked him to write down his name. And the other employee who was working that day and he went to take the paper back to write more, but then he said actually I shouldn't give out her purpose.  Personal number, I'll give you the store number instead. And I said well, you can give me the store number and you can cross off her number, but I definitely need that slip of paper because that's my evidence for the breakfast that I ordered that was available. But it's not served to me. I said I would just like to bounce some ideas off your manager because all the workers are very hungry in the morning and we're spending tons of money on gas and food. We make a lot for cleaning up after the hurricanes, but we like to spend it too.  I said, why don't you just turn off the screens in the hours that you're not serving food and then people would know that. Hey, you're not serving food yet. It's very confusing when the food is prepared and sitting there. The screens are on. They're all working and no hours are posted. He said I'm sure my manager will not be interested in any of your ideas. I said okay. I should still like her number. Here's where I might be t. AI gotten my car, drove away and I could still see her personal number on the slip of paper even though he tried to scribble it out. I called her at 7 AM. In the morning on a Sunday and she called me back and she was so nice.  She said that guy who had treated me in a weird way by saying that I said. I'm sure the manager will want to hear your opinions. And he said I wasn't saying opinions. I was stating facts and I said OOK and I expressed this turn. She's like, yeah, he's kind of mad at me right now because he's not my favorite employee. There's something like that anyways. She appreciated me calling her and I felt so.  Wonderful that she appreciates her customers.And I guess I'm asking.Am I the asshole pulling of karen and asking to speak to the manager because I had some good ideas about how to avoid confusion and make more money",1,1731869726.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False

It’s very rare that he’ll eat a sustainable amount of food and if he doesn’t, he’ll have coffee and snacks back to back days. 
I thought it was fine but he’s always cold and he’s underweight. 
I’m overweight so I thought maybe my habits would rub off on him (in a good way) and get him eating meals at least. 
However, he now verbally complains that he can’t eat enough, he can’t eat a meal, he’s freezing, etc. 
I just want him to gain atleast 10-20 pounds for his sake.. I want him to feel good about himself but where do I start :( I don’t want to force feed him.

1gtkkek,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gtkkek/aita_for_asking_my_mil_how_many_of_my_husbands/,AITA for asking my MIL how many of my husband’s soccer games she went too after she insulted me for taking time off work to be with my kids? ,"
37F. I’m married and a mom of three (7M, 3F, and 1F). I’m an attorney, and have always worked hard and taken my career seriously. I never thought I’d want to take time away from work, but before I had my youngest daughter, I was feeling burnt out from working non-stop and also taking care of two young children. I was always tired when I was with my kids and hardly had any time to spend with them during the week. My husband and I spoke about it, and agreed it would be the best thing for our family for me to take some time off work. I don’t see myself doing this for more than a few years, and I plan on going back to work once my youngest starts kindergarten. I feel incredibly fortunate that I have the financial ability to spend the extra time with my kids when they’re so little. I know I won’t get this time with them back and that I’ll have the rest of my life to focus on my career.

Everyone has been supportive of this decision except for my MIL. My MIL is also an attorney, and she’s incredibly driven and  well-known in our city. I know she was very happy I ended up with her son, and I think it’s in large part because she respects women who are ambitious and passionate about their careers. I’ve heard her talk negatively about stay at home moms over the years. Specifically, she thinks they’re  boring, putting themselves in a position to be taken advantage of,  and setting poor examples for their daughters. She also thinks men who want to be with stay at home moms are insecure and  just want someone they can control. 

So obviously, she didn’t seem pleased when we told her about my plan to take some time off work, but she’s kept her mouth shut for the most part. Things changed last night, when we had her and my FIL over for dinner. I cooked, and my MIL joked that she never thought she’d live to see the day when I prepared a home cooked meal. I said I have a bit more time on my hands now and I actually enjoy it. She said she’s glad I’m putting my law school education to good use. 

I asked what she meant, and my MIL said she didn’t understand my new “phase.” She said I spent so much time and money getting my education, and it seems like a waste to be home cooking instead of taking advantage of my skills. She also said I seem unhappy, and thinks it’s because I’m home all day instead of developing myself. I told my MIL I’m incredibly happy, and she said I’m lying to myself and not setting the best example possible for my little girls. She says it’s important to show them they can work hard and also be great mothers. She even said I’m teaching them it’s okay to depend on a man and waste their potential. She then said that her mom was brilliant and never had the opportunity to have a career because of the era she was born into, and it makes her sad to see me throw away a life that her mother and so many other women would have killed for.

My husband jumped in and said I’m not dependent on him, since I have a great education and resume, and I can go back to work at anytime. He also said that I’ve been working 70 to 80 hours per week since
I was twenty-six, and there’s nothing wrong with me taking some time off to be with our kids when they’re young. My MIL then asked my husband if he put me up to this, and said she raised him better than that.

My MIL said I’m too talented and smart to be home and that she hardly recognizes the ambitious and passionate twenty year old that she first met. I started crying, and told my MIL that I feel good about my decision and don’t appreciate her giving me unsolicited advice. I said that I love my career, but my kids are the most important thing to me, and I want to be a more involved mom than I was before. My MIL asked why I can’t work and be involved with them, and I said it’s just harder and I felt I was missing out on their lives before. She asked if I think women who work are missing out on their kids lives, and I said women who work as much as I did certainly miss out on parts of their lives  and don’t have as much time to be with their kids. 

My MIL said that she didn’t miss out on her son’s life, and I asked how many of his soccer games she went to. My husband was a college soccer player, and he’s told me
in the past that his parents never went to his games when he was little and that he always had to carpool with teammates. He’s also told me that his mom is a great adult mom since she’s interested in his life and gives great advice, but she wasn’t as interested in him when he was a young kid.

My comments set my MIL off, and she said I was disrespecting women who paved the way for me to have a career. My MIL and FIL left shortly after.

My husband is obviously upset about the situation. He thinks his mom was way out of line, but also doesn’t like that I brought up the fact that she never went to his soccer games. He said I stooped to her level and also that it wasn’t my place to comment on his childhood. My husband feels horrible  about the situation and has apologized for his mom’s judgmental comments, but desperately wants us to work it out. He wants us to sit down for coffee and apologize to each other, but I’m not ready. AITAH for my comments and do I owe my MIL an apology?",9,1731869388.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False
1gtkk5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1gtkk5h/virtualcoffee_opportunities_for_cs_students_to/,VirtualCoffee: opportunities for cs students to connect with industry pros,"Hey everyone,

I'm excited to share that I'm launching the waitlist for VirtualCoffee, a platform aimed at helping CS students connect with industry professionals to get a better understanding of specific careers, job opportunities, and companies. I’ve had my fair share of struggles connecting with people from large tech companies as my school was not a target school nor in the US. Now that I’ve actually graduated and gotten a job at a FAANG company, I’ve realized how much that limitation hindered my ability to explore what was available to me. I know a lot of students who might be like me and struggle with networking, especially if their schools don’t have great career fairs or aren’t able to convince popular companies to attend. That’s where VirtualCoffee comes in.

Not everyone has access to a strong alumni network or top-tier recruiting events, and many of us miss out on networking chances simply because we don't know the right people in the industry. VirtualCoffee aims to change that by connecting you directly with professionals who can provide guidance, mentorship, or even potential job leads.

How it'll work:

* You'll be able to schedule virtual coffee chats with verified professionals (think TeamBlind verification) from various tech companies (e.g. FAANG), and ask them about their career paths, roles, and industry.
* You can filter by interests, whether you’re looking to get into front-end, back-end, data science, or something else.
* You’ll also get advice on building a career roadmap, tips for interviews, and how to stand out even if you're not at a ""target"" school.

I’m aiming to build something that’s actually helpful, and I’d love for any CS majors who’ve felt the networking gap (or just want to learn more about different career paths) to check it out and sign up for the waitlist.

If you’re interested, here’s the link to join the waitlist: [https://virtualcoffee.vercel.app/](https://virtualcoffee.vercel.app/)

Looking forward to hearing what you think, and feel free to ask any questions!

My days (when i’m not working lol) are spent usually reading, baking and collecting knick knacks from thrift stores, I love a nice piece of clutter! 

I’m originally from South America and I’m fluently bilingual, I’d be more than happy to teach you some words in Spanish if you’re interested.

Some fun facts about me are that I’m both and EMT and a Licensed Massage Therapist, currently looking into cosmetology school as well, I like to consider myself a jack of all trades, I like learning everything and anything as much as I possibly can.

I’m in the process of getting my P.O. box set up for sending letters so our correspondence might not be immediate but please contact me if you’re interested! 

My ideal penpal would be male, age is not an issue for me as long as you’re OVER 19 years old, I also am looking for someone who likes to share details of their everyday life, yes, even the mundane, tell me about that cup of coffee you drank today and the cat you saw crossing the street! I’m also looking for someone who won’t mind a plain letter, I’m not much of an artist but I promise I put effort into my writing!

I enjoy espresso and lattes and getting kinda sick of high prices and poor quality from high street coffee shops. I’m looking for advice on my first set up..

Gaggia Classic pro or Rancillio Silvia for the machine.

And,

Fellow Opus or Baratza Encore ESP for the grinder.

Any advice would be great, or if someone recommends something other than the above please let me know and I will throw it into the mix. I presume the above options would make good quality lattes, and with some practice be better than the high street coffee I’m currently drinking?

It's flourless, you can put less chocolate chips if you want it to be less sweet. Walnuts are optional. I haven't found a vegan and gluten free brownie with a better texture.

You need a good blender and a scale.


100g dates
120g peanut butter or almond butter
2/3 cup of espresso (or coffee - i just use instant) 
240g black beans
1 tbsp miso
1 tbsp honey
1 tbsp cocoa powder
1 tsp baking powder
50g chocolate chips
2 flax egg (mix 2 heapin tbsp flax with the coffee)
1/4 heaping tsp. Potato starch or other starch


Chop the dates up real fine and soak them in the espresso til they're soft (10 - 20 minutes) 

Drain the dates, reserving the leftover espresso. 

Put the dates, peanut butter, black beans, cocoa powder, miso, honey, and baking powder in a blender. Blend it really smooth. Add the coffee flax egg. Consistency should be like muffin batter, not ""pourable"". 

Stir in the chocolate chips, and spread the mixture in a greased baking pan. Bake at 350 for about 25 -30min, until you can poke it with a skewer and it comes out clean (make sure you are poking a part with no chocolate chips as they will always be melted).

I just visited a friend in NYC last week and had forgotten how much I LOVE living in a walkable city. We would eat breakfast, leave and walk around the city pretty much til dinner and then take the train home. I loved being able to walk to get groceries, coffee, lunch, and to just shop around or to walk by the river. 
I used to live in Lincoln NE which was also a very walkable little city (much smaller tho lol). I lived outside of “downtown” but could still walk there from my apartment and would frequently walk across campus and downtown pretty much every day.
I now live in a suburban area outside of Cincinnati, and I just miss being able to walk to wherever I need to go. I guess my question is: how do you get your steps in while living in boring areas?

1gtki3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1gtki3z/launching_virtualcoffee_opportunities_for_cs/,Launching VirtualCoffee: opportunities for cs students to connect with industry pros,"Hey everyone,

I'm excited to share that I'm launching the waitlist for VirtualCoffee, a platform aimed at helping CS students connect with industry professionals to get a better understanding of specific careers, job opportunities, and companies. I’ve had my fair share of struggles connecting with people from large tech companies as my school was not a target school nor in the US. Now that I’ve actually graduated and gotten a job at a FAANG company, I’ve realized how much that limitation hindered my ability to explore what was available to me. I know a lot of students who might be like me and struggle with networking, especially if their schools don’t have great career fairs or aren’t able to convince popular companies to attend. That’s where VirtualCoffee comes in.

Not everyone has access to a strong alumni network or top-tier recruiting events, and many of us miss out on networking chances simply because we don't know the right people in the industry. VirtualCoffee aims to change that by connecting you directly with professionals who can provide guidance, mentorship, or even potential job leads.

How it'll work:

* You'll be able to schedule virtual coffee chats with verified professionals (think TeamBlind verification) from various tech companies (e.g. FAANG), and ask them about their career paths, roles, and industry.
* You can filter by interests, whether you’re looking to get into front-end, back-end, data science, or something else.
* You’ll also get advice on building a career roadmap, tips for interviews, and how to stand out even if you're not at a ""target"" school.

I’m aiming to build something that’s actually helpful, and I’d love for any CS majors who’ve felt the networking gap (or just want to learn more about different career paths) to check it out and sign up for the waitlist.

If you’re interested, here’s the link to join the waitlist: [https://virtualcoffee.vercel.app/](https://virtualcoffee.vercel.app/)

Looking forward to hearing what you think, and feel free to ask any questions!

For just the team I typically give them each something in the $20 realm such as scratch lotto tickets, box of chocolates, coffee gift card,  etc.  I've become aware that these are not very inclusive gifts so I'm trying to be better.

I've seen a fair amount of ""the owner is such an idiot"" in here, and I'd like to avoid that.

I own a small dessert shop in Southern California and we're going to add an indoor coffee cart.  Due to local regulations, an indoor coffee cart is way easier to permit than putting in an ""actual"" coffee shop.  

**Layout:** The permit allows up to 4 separate pieces (carts), so you could have a sink cart, fridge cart, coffee machine cart, etc.  I've got about 375 sq ft to work with, say 25 x 15 for the whole thing; carts, customer space, tables, etc, plus I have a large outdoor seating area.   

**Budget:** $30k, including permits.  

**Market:** We have a steady but slow stream of current customers.  We're on a busy street in a walkable neighborhood with lots of foot traffic.  There are 4 other coffee shops close by, one of which is Starbucks.  For about 2 months we had a micro-business coffee cart coming into our store as their side hustle, but they just couldn't keep their shit together; they worked 2-3 days a week, would be late or not show up, etc.  We really wanted them to crush, but for whatever reason they weren't up to the task.  We now routinely get asked to serve coffee.

**Background:** I like coffee. I roast, grind, and make my own at home, but I'm not a barista and won't be working as one in this business.  The intention here is to use a place we're already paying rent on and create a new business line that brings in more customers. 

**General Plan:** We'll hire a barista to run the cart and support them to do an excellent job.  They'll have a say in how the whole thing gets laid out and executed.  

I've been running small businesses most of my adult life, and I've found 2 things relative to this ask:  First, the people who actually interact with the customers usually have good advice.  Second, the most expensive mistakes are made in planning (which is also the cheapest time to make giant changes.)

With all that as background...

**Here are 4 questions I have:**  
  
1) What is the single biggest mistake/problem you as a barista working for a coffee shop see that a savvy owner, if they just listened to you, could fix?  

2) If you were to work at a shop for the ""perfect"" owner, what would that look like?

3) Do you have any physical layout suggestions that come from years of experience?  

4) Is there any other piece of advice you'd give?",3,1731868767.0,barista,8,0.8,False

He suggested we could adjust the medication or try alternatives based on my response after one month.

It's been 4 days since I started. On the first day, I noticed a slightly higher heart rate and dry mouth for about 3 hours, but those effects disappeared after day one. The medication has made me feel calmer and more positive, and I’ve stopped constantly listening to podcasts during activities like showering or studying. I also noticed that I was more outgoing and friendlier on the first day. My hunger has decreased, making it easier to stick to my diet, though I still get hungry. My sleep hasn’t been affected—I even napped on the third day—but I needed coffee today after feeling sleepy in the afternoon.

However, my concentration still isn’t where I want it to be. I get distracted by random thoughts and often chase them. I've struggled with executive dysfunction over the past year, particularly since grad school began in August. The semester has been especially challenging, with only two weeks left and a lot of work to finish. I still feel that I need better focus and concentration. I don’t feel much different internally after taking it.

I’ve read that psychiatrists often titrate doses to find the most effective one for each patient. I’m not sure if my PCP is doing this or how long it typically takes. Should I consult a psychiatrist to ensure I find the correct dosage as soon as possible?",3,1731868677.0,ADHD,7,1.0,False

I think a lot of people into these videos were little kids during that time and thus view it as a fun and exciting version of adulthood, specifically womanhood. 

Anyway I’m not unique in that I love the aesthetic and it makes me so nostalgic for being an early 2000s kid! I’m throwing some links below to give a more specific idea of what I’m talking about:

- Practical Magic
- Parent Trap (sorta)
- When Harry Met Sally (this just fits all vibes)

I notice that this is a topic that comes up allll the time and wanted to share my insights as well as open up the floor for others to share what has worked for them when encouraging or facilitating loved ones with clutter.


Firstly, I'd love to venture beyond the ""you shouldn't Declutter for others and shouldn't press then to Declutter if they are at all resistant to it"" aspect of this conversation. I feel this is a good rule of thumb that is focused on to the point of missing all the circumstances in which it is actually helpful and caring to walk someone through their process (a process many of us have walked ourselves through many many times).


The reality is that no one knows our loved ones like we do, and no one but us has to live with them. we are certainly able to gently press or facilitate their process in a way that isn't hurtful or harmful to them... especially if we understand they actually would like to have less things in the way of their ""favorites"" or more space to do art  at their desk, etc etc etc.

EXAMPLE
-we have a small collection of records that fits in a 18"" space on a shelf.
I had noticed that the records were getting tight in there, which could lead to damage/warping over time, so I let my partner know I needed him to go through and see if there's any he'd like to declutter, so we can maintain a space for the records to be kept intact. 
That was months ago!
This week on a free relaxed morning I made him a big cup of coffee and pulled out all the records. I told him to pull out his ""definite keep"" treasure albums (and I pulled out mine). I put those back on the shelf immediately and then one by one I put the records on and we went about our day, while they were playing. We discussed how often we listen to records vs how many we own. We also discussed that when he wants to listen, is he likely to pull this exact record? Or one of his pile of favorites? We decluttered enough records to keep our current ones stored well in the space we had... Simple as that.


Where am I going with this? 

TLDR:
Sometimes people are overwhelmed and unable to start on their own-a little encouragement and structure from someone who is a already good at the task can make all the difference in getting things done.

1gtk64e,https://www.reddit.com/r/controlgame/comments/1gtk64e/the_white_pyramid_is_the_other/,The White Pyramid is the Other,"The most obscure piece of Control lore is “the Other”. It is only mentioned a handful of times. But I think I’ve pieced together what it is/how it fits into the cosmology of the RCU: The Other is the White Pyramid, and the White Pyramid is the Astral Plane.

First, let’s look at what The Board says when you first meet them:

<**We are broadcasting from the Pyramid/Other**>

Now, you may assume that the pyramid they’re mentioning is the Black Pyramid, but let’s look deeper. The slash usually indicates two terms being used synonymously, and in other instances the Board refers to “the Other” as a distinct thing from themselves. So the Pyramid being associated with the Other is likely not their own. I believe they are broadcasting from within the White Pyramid (we see a symbol for it in the Oceanview) which we know as the Astral Plane. 

< **Objects of Power are Holders/665** >

< **to the Other/Blessing**>

The Board claim that OOP’s are linked to the Other. We know that OOP’s are linked to the Astral Plane. Darling believes that OOP’s and Altered Items gain their power through the collective unconscious of humanity. The Astral Plane/Other are likely the realm of the collective unconscious made manifest.  


< **The Astral Plane is a Conflux/Switchboard** >

The Board say this about Astral Plane. A conflux could refer to the confluence of humanity’s collective unconscious. The switchboard aspect is likely connected to resonance, since a switchboard can control sound in a show. Darling believes Resonance is a key component in Altered objects and items. The Board controls the Other like a switchboard, allowing them to force their connection to altered phenomenon (as Emily speculates). 

https://www.reddit.com/r/controlgame/s/7UGibys9NZ

If you read my last post about the significance of fire in Remedy’s games, you’d know the fire symbolism is tied to parautilitarians. Fire is a classical element that is associated with polyhedrons (another recurring piece of symbolism in Remedy’s games). In particular it’s associated with the Tetrahedron, which is an upright pyramid, just like the White Pyramid symbol. 

The White Pyramid being the Astral Plane and the association with fire would explain why most parautilitarians are described as having “fire” within them. Astral bodies are also usually described as being made of light or fire. 

The Other could be a reference to a mythological concept known as the Otherworld/Otherside. In most mythologies there is an astral area outside of the human world that a hero must cross a vast boundary to access. 

> Most stories in Old Norse mythology show a clear division between ""This World"", pertaining to that of gods and men, and ""The Other"", which is inhabited by jötnar and beings associated with them.

This aligns well with the Astral Plane.

At the end of the North Star episode of Night Springs, you can find a mural depicting an inverted pyramid on top of an upright pyramid. The mural shows the inverted pyramid (Dark Triangle Coffee aka The Board) feeding off of a group of people contained within the upright pyramid. I believed we are seeing The Board feeding off of the collective unconscious of humanity contained within the Other/White Pyramid/Astral Plane. 

TLDR; The obscure Other is what we know as the Astral Plane symbolized by the White Pyramid. It represents humanity’s collective unconscious and inherent paranatural power. The Board has burrowed their way into it to take control of it. ",18,1731868341.0,controlgame,5,0.89,False

For those that have or currently live there, what are your impressions? My partner and I are in our late 20s, and have a dog. I really value trail access, which looks great there. Dog-walking and running looks great there too. There is super easy access to the climbing gym which is a plus, and at least one coffee shop.

But it's a drive away from downtown. We're probably fine with that, but I'd rather not feel too socially isolated. Do you find that it's easy to still get out to bars and restaurants? If you do, are you driving or walking? How do you find access to groceries?

Commuting to Denver is also a consideration, but it looks like as far as that goes, it should be really no different than being anywhere else in Golden.

* Water flow from the reservoir is good. If I poke something in through the valve in the bottom of the reservoir water flows very freely.
* I've replaced the pump.
* I've checked the level sensor in the tank. It was a bit tarnished but not enough to affect conductivity. I cleaned it up and put it back in.

I read about people wanting an egg so bad too soon, wanting to find a hack or shortcut, wanting to figure out a way how to eat, unhealthy food, not wanting to give up coffee. I realize what are the things that I will want to find the easy way out to eat? 

Consider myself a pretty smart person very resourceful. I love to find solutions, but never was able to attain long-term results, no matter how smart I thought I was. I can’t help but think that this is why we’re in the position that we are in the first place, and this is why everyone in this feed struggles with food addiction and why we are making the choice to have surgery or had surgery.

I don’t want to continue with the food addict brain, but maybe perhaps if I/we start to accept and believe that we are food addicts maybe we won’t try to be so slick, and find hacks and tricks to find the food that triggers the bad behavior? 

I don’t know about you, but it just seems like a huge sacrifice and seriously invasive surgery just to resume and continue with the same mindset and behavior? 

I don’t know, maybe what you want to eat the most right now should be an indication that you should fight against to eat. Besides a craving or a desire to eat something maybe reflect when do you crave and desire to eat the thing, what is happening at that moment? What happened right before you started to feel, crave or want that? What’s gonna be happening after, that should reveal a lot..

I have finally 100% decided that I want this surgery, but I realize that’s not gonna be enough, because if I don’t change my mindset nothing changes. Am I gonna be like everyone else trying to find the hack, trying to find the shortcut, trying to find the soonest way to eat something? And for what? So that I can make myself sick again and slowly overtime stretch my stomach back out and gain all the weight back? 

I now know why our surgeons are so adamant about us really trying to eat healthy six months before and losing as much weight as we can and learning how to eat small portions and healthier food..Because addicts can’t just have a little bit of anything when they are in rehabilitation and recovery ❤️‍🩹 

Let’s be good to ourselves at whatever stage we’re in right now! Pre or post we deserve a better life! This change is forever, not just until our stomach heals. Prayers to all the pre-surgery candidates, blessings to all the post surgery, I pray that we all heal our mind, our heart, and our spirit, so that we can be whole again and not fall back into food addiction again.🙏❤️ (Surgery December 10th)",2,1731867994.0,BariatricSurgery,7,1.0,False

For those that didn't see my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1f3iavu/obisdian_git_sync_natively_on_android/), GitSync is an **Android git client that aims to simplify the process of syncing a folder between a git remote and a local directory**. It works in the background to keep your files synced with a simple one-time setup and numerous options for activating manual syncs.

I have been hard at work over the last few months improving all the basic functionalities of the app for out-of-mind daily use, adding a user-friendly onboarding flow and adding a **quick and easy method for resolving any sync conflicts** that occur. It also has a section to keep track of recent commits and allows you to enable or disable displaying a message when syncing occurs.

I own a 2003 (pre facelift) Modern Luxury package Ls430 (4.3l V8 RWD Boat, with a 5-Speed auto), this is my pride and joy spent 4 years saving up for one, it is my only car and thus my daily driver. This was my first ever Attempt At auto crossing, no track experiencing, no professional training no seat time nothing, Just been driving for \~5 years. I went with a few friends one whom had done it before, and the results were interesting, I was in Rungroup 3 (Car Number 69) And each participate got 4 Runs, it was two laps around a pretty simple track, the following details my 4 Runs:

1 My first attempt was initialized by accident they had a grid and running groups and I had pulled forward to get one of my passengers a helmet than circle back but then they had me run ahead of where I was supposed to be so I was tossed on the spot with my other two passengers barely making it to my car in-time for my first lap, we made it and it wasn't a bad run, I started this one and all my runs With the Shafter Engaged at 2, so that the car would take off in 1st Jump to second and stay there the entire time, I didnt Want it upshifting to 3 4 or 5, First half was a lil shaky the traction control didn't really help with slide outs that much it just got in my way beeped at me, So halfway thru I disabled VSC and the rest of that run was very smooth, I Didn't hit any cones my final lap time was 56.945

Sadly I didn't get any Footage for this first run

2 Second lap was an unmitigated complete total disaster lol, The lap started with My passenger and I agreeing he would turn off VSC after I Launched, I for some reason decided to just turn it off without telling him and figured I could manage on my own, then when the lap started He went to reach for the VSC and a panicked and swept my hand to stop him, in the process I accidentally and without Realizing until the run was over, Slapped the shifter Into L or 1st gear and the entire reminder of the run I was just revving the ever-living shit out of the 3UZ and with no VSC and High reving first gear I ended up spinning out when I entered the cones the wrong order out of pure frustration, Thankfully the LS430s God tier brakes were able to save my ass and I stopped it inches from smashing into the curb. All in all there were about 7 DNQs in the span of 30 seconds

For your Viewing Pleasure/Horror This run was Filmed: [https://youtu.be/khWDhLXJSAM?si=P\_YZcOR8vGiHT031](https://youtu.be/khWDhLXJSAM?si=P_YZcOR8vGiHT031)

3 Run Three was more a combination of run two and run 1 I had VSC off and I made my turns without issue I was better focused until the start of the 2nd lap It worked great until I as seen in run 2 footage I again entered the cones in the wrong order and got a DNQ

Sadly No one to record this run either

4 By Run four I was far more conservative with my throttle and Was concerned with my tires surviving the highway trip home, so I took it easy on this one Still VSC off and Pulled off a pretty good time around 52-53 seconds, Ill find the exact time when I pull everything from my car later today, Didnt hit any cones, and By this point i knew the track pretty well This run was recorded and from Two Different POVs, One by someone on Cone duty and another out on the Hill:

All in all I definitely would recommend Going to one of these if you are a car enthusiast and want to know how your car will really handle under certain conditions, and if not that than Did I mention it was a Shit ton of fun? Hell the 430 all things considered Isn't the worst Auto-crossing car you could try, I Even with this being my first time, and my sub par, unideal times I managed to beat some hideous BMW Egg-looking Crossover coupesuv thing, and a Lincoln LS. I imagine with some more skill practice and refinement I could get my times down into the 40s Territory. If not for the fun of actually driving yourself it is a lot of fun to Ride along as a passenger With other peoples cars Or even to sit and watch people try laps its a hell of a lot safer and entertaining than your average cars and coffee sort of thing and you actually get to watch some drivers with some skill Drive these cars rather than have them sit around looking pretty.

I double up the top and bottom boards by gluing and using way to many clamps. 11 3/4 spacing between shelves. Bottom shelf is 11 7/8 spacing.

I attached the 2x1 to the outer edge of the outswinging side to attach the trim to. Held on by 1 1/4 counter sunk construction screw.

At each step I measured what size cuts were needed rather than having a master cut list.

The main thing I would have done differently is to have slanted the outer edge to allow for the face to be slightly wider for a tighter fit into the doorway.

The trim isn't fully finished or properly attached just sized.

That was all I was able to finish in one day.

Better trim will eventually be made and mounted. Wife wants it painted white. I am going to added a hidden latch and release. What will be on the shelves in the end is up the wife. My office/ study/ gaming room, a utility closest, and a second bathroom are behind the door.

1gtjrzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gtjrzq/many_people_dont_know_it_yet_but_the_world_is/,"Many people don't know it yet, but the world is ending.","Orange narcotic strips and pink cotton candy clouds filled the sky. Two lovers sat on a bench, shared laughs and wondered about a life together forever. Children played in parks and drew chalk animals on concrete.

Summer’s end neared. Society and life would change forever. People would meet their dead relatives again. Moments later, millions of bright stars bloomed across the sky—the rapture, or a miracle from God? The small spheres materialized into existence as if by the flip of a switch, oblivious to any and all effects against humanity. The daytime stars exploded into an orange-purple dust—a silent process save for the distant boom at the end.

A blanket of strong light covered the sky. People took shelter or averted their gaze. Nations didn’t know how to react, except for the 999 witnesses of the entire event. Gathered as one big family, those people opened a church and streamed weekly masses online. The first man to see the full explosions became the leader. Nathaniel Sullivan, once a plumber, rose to fame as the number one televangelist in the world.

Three weeks after the event, dubbed The Bloom, the 999 announced Ambrosia, a miracle medicine.

“Dearest people of this world! Do not be afraid and have faith! Do you miss your dear family and friends who’ve passed away? Do you want to see them again? Ambrosia is the way; Ambrosia is the light!” Nathan Sullivan preached live on air.

The preacher said the 999 conducted internal tests. If it all went well, Sullivan would see his wife and daughter again. The man ingested Ambrosia. His body tensed and jerked on the leather chair. His pupils dilated to an abnormal size. The reverend calmed down moments after and fixated the camera with bloodshot eyes. Tears ran down his cheeks, and white thin lines brought back memories from the past.

After a few seconds passed, the image changed to static. Reverend Sullivan kneeled before only what he could have seen. The man stared at a fixed point in the room with hands clenched together. More tears streamed down his cheeks, and his lower lip trembled.

“I’m sorry. Please forgive me. I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” he said with arms extended, waiting for a long hug that never came.

“Daddy, come to us,” a boy’s voice whispered from a distant place. Devoid of life, it gurgled; water stuck in its throat. Yet, Nathaniel Sullivan’s eyes could not have betrayed him.

“I am. Right now,” Nathaniel Sullivan said. A concrete certainty washed over the man’s mind and body, and immense joy filled his broken heart.

Reverend Sullivan scanned the room and stared in confusion at every person in the room. The preacher moved with slow steps toward the large window and jumped from the 10th story of the sect’s church. A large crowd gathered around the mangled body. People touched the corpse as if Nathaniel Sullivan was a miracle man, a saint, a messiah sent by God to heal the entire world, end wars, eradicate famine, destroy addiction and bring closure to grieving families.

Several reruns of the incident reported no faces in the static. Social media platforms dissected the situation from one end to the other. Millions of people reported seeing the woman and boy in the static if only for a moment. Online and televised hysteria engulfed humanity’s hive mind. The sect announced a two-hour break to assess the situation. The next livestream’s numbers exceeded the first with a peak audience of 750 million people.

The doomsday cult had elected a new female leader. The live feed showed the woman in the middle of over a hundred members standing on the edge of the roof. Each pair of teary eyes studied the horizon. The preacher swallowed the Ambrosia pill first, and the rest followed suit. Seconds after, like death dominos, all the members leaped. The world heard continuous thumps and splashes, a grotesque symphony of broken bones and sinew.

Formal accusations could not be brought to what remains of the sect. All people who committed suicide did so out of free will. The remainder of the sect grew more powerful. Influential people across the world infiltrated it and the new religion became the fastest growing in history.

Ambrosia too became the fastest selling drug in the world. Entire families wanted to see deceased relatives or friends; parents forced kids to ingest the drug because grandparents waited to meet on the other side. Others only chased the high or wanted to see if the drug worked as advertised.

The sect’s shadow leaders, the people behind the curtain, spoke through government representatives or powerful media figures about the drug. The short press release read: The 999 is aware Ambrosia might be perceived as unethical, but it is a product like any other. The free-market dictates supply and demand, and no one is forced to buy it. The miracle pill has immediate and permanent effects, and we understand that. But one should look at this from another perspective: it brings closure to the end-user and allows for a final meeting with loved ones.

Priced at only $9.99/pill, the sect tailored Ambrosia for all budgets—over 100 million doses sold in the first day. People walked out of drug stores, grocery stores, markets and malls smiling and excited to see people long gone. With a 100% success rate, Ambrosia delivered on its promise: just one more moment of happiness.

News reports became hard to read or listen to. Corpses piled high, and graveyards hit maximum capacity, open fields the same. Crematories have become one of the most profitable businesses in the world.

Salmon pink and lavender purple skies blessed people’s sights with a sense of false serenity. Post-explosion Bloom dust still hung in the air, like ashes of a thousand-year burning flame, recently extinguished. People breathed in colored glitter, a disease of alien origin.

Police officer Robert Newson despised the new reality and hated to see people rushing to their deaths.

“Listen to that, Bob. They’re boasting about numbers again. This goddamn news makes me sick,” his best friend Vince said. “Damn, what this world has come to.”

“Screw them, man. It’s damaged way beyond repair. Heard the reported number of suicides now caps at 1.5 billion, but who knows the real numbers?”

“Yeah, it’s crazy. What frightens me most is that society acts like it’s normal. The sects sell Ambrosia like lollipops, and no one does anything. It’s all a gigantic mass depopulation plan. Fewer people means they’re easier to control and lie to.”

After paying the check at the diner, the men headed out for a walk and met a family. The mother, father and daughter hung from a branch of the oldest oak in town. The suicides had taken places just moments before.

“Jesus Christ, why? Why would you do this? You killed what most people would kill for,” Robert shouted at the dead parents.

The police officer thought about his wife’s and daughter’s funeral. Both stood silent, still and lifeless. A drunk driver had hit their car three years back—full frontal collision. The drunkard had fled the scene, unscathed and never to be seen again. Vince put a hand on Robert’s shoulder, removed his cap and didn’t say a word. Both knew prayers would not bring back the dead—no matter how much love existed in the world.

Society went through drastic changes. People had learned to adapt to a more gruesome reality, and to live under different circumstances and new laws. Robert Newson’s job almost became obsolete. Most people couldn’t be saved. World governments forbade police forces to intervene in cases of suicide.

A man stood in a pool of blood on a front porch with long slits on his forearms. Death embraced people with loving and cold arms and never let go.

“Will this insanity ever end, Vince?”

“As long as there’s demand for that stuff, I don’t think it will.”

Robert and Vince reminisced about the good, old days—family visits, kids playing, wives laughing, eating delicious barbecues and cracking open cold ones. Good years had gone by, and the world had morphed into a living hell.

The two best friends reached the woods at the edge of the city and walked on the trail towards the lake. Over a dozen bodies floated face down on the silvery surface. Death had become the number one pollution factor worldwide. The men stood frozen with mouths wide open.

“Jesus Christ. I just don’t understand how any of this works anymore,” Robert said.

“Let’s… Let’s just head back to my place and crash on the couch.”

Vince grabbed the remote control and flipped through the TV channels.

“A pilot crashed a plane in Romania, all 125 passengers dead.”

“A new wave of mass suicides in Japan. 85 people plunged to their deaths in Tokyo, 64 in Yokohama, 36 in Nagoya.”

“45 people at an Anti-Ambrosia protest sliced their throats open with a box-cutter.”

“A New-York man allegedly ingested Ambrosia and is still alive,” the news lady said, “and our colleague is right there with him setting up for a live interview.”

Robert and Vince looked at each other in disbelief. Could such a thing even be possible?

Jim Marshall, a blue-collar worker, had bloodshot eyes and cracked lips. The first and only known Ambrosia survivor’s face showed signs of seeing unfathomable beasts. The man rocked back and forth in the armchair.

“So, Mr. Marshall, could you tell us about your experience with Ambrosia?” the interviewer asked. “I’m sure our viewers at home want to know all the details.”

“Nothing is real. Ambrosia brings only madness and death. It’s a mere gateway. After swallowing it, the creatures appear in your mind before death. The aliens came with the Bloom and are living in the dust poisoning humanity’s lungs,” Jim rambled. “When the hallucination begins, the beings are friendly and make you see beautiful false things. It’s all a rapid succession of events— until the creatures kill you.

“So, it’s all a big lie?”

“The Bloom means rapture. Humanity’s days are numbered. It’s only one big world government now. The news is all lies. How else would an event of such magnitude have been possible?”

“What do the aliens look like, Mr. Marshall?”

“Indescribable appearance. I saw foggy shadows over fifteen feet tall. Maybe it’s the reason I survived; you know? Maybe the connection severed before I could see the aliens. Afterwards, I just came back to life, so to speak.”

At home, the two best friends’ eyes were glued to the screen.

“So, how exactly did you try doing it? Sorry if it’s personal and you can choose not to answer, but it would be best if the public knows more?”

“No problem, I’ll answer. Sleeping pills. Ten times the recommended dose—laid in bed and went to sleep in the bedroom. I wanted to see my mother again and like violent endings are not my thing.”

“Phew, might as well call you a miracle, Mr. Marshall. You’re one lucky man, I’ll give you that.”

“Probably, not sure. Look, sir, I’m just an average Joe. I don’t want to be a star or anything. The truth is all that matters.”

“If you’re telling the truth as it is, then why do they let you do it?”

“I don’t know, really. Maybe people watching will think I’m crazy?”

“Thank you very much for sharing your experience with us, Mr. Marshall.”

“Thanks for believing me.”

Robert and Vince agreed that Marshall told the truth. The survivor’s body language suggested it.

The men sat in silence on the couch—both trying to assimilate Marshall’s story. What would it have taken to make the world a safer place again if not a revolution? The idea had cemented itself in Robert’s mind. But what would be cost have been? How many people would have died if a war was to break loose?

Those thoughts dissipated when Vince’s phone rang. His wife Jessica had picked up their daughter Rebecca from school. No suicides happened that day, thank goodness.

The next day, the media tore apart the survivor—a liar, cheat, fraud, an insane person chasing his fifteen minutes of fame. In the afternoon, a woman called 911 and reported finding Marshall’s corpse inside a dumpster with a red plastic cord around his neck. On the desk in his living room, police found a note saying: “I wanted to be famous for a little while. Ambrosia works 100%.”

Robert Newson’s jaw dropped. The police officer called Vince right away.

“Seen the news?”

“Yeah, it’s… it’s very strange.”

“Strange? Vince, it’s right there, man. The aliens killed Marshall for speaking up against this global propaganda. It’s an assassination. We’ll talk more about it after work.”

Robert Newson got in the cruiser and drove to the station. The purple-orange dust in the air had a heavy miasma of rotting flesh and boiling blood. A strong migraine wrapped around his skull like a strong iron vise—first one in over fifteen years. The possibility of leaving town and going into hiding took shape in the police officer’s mind. Vince had a cabin two towns east of the mountains, buried deep within the woods. The men would bring as many supplies as possible and would venture into town at night disguised with fake beards and glasses to shop for necessities.

The sheriff had arrived already, a not-so-regular thing.

“Ah, morning, Bob. Feeling alright? Your face’s all pale.”

“Morning, boss. Yeah, just a headache.”

“Come to my office for a few minutes? I want you to meet a fine gentleman.”

A man stood on the couch with a cigarette in the corner of his mouth—tall, thin, dressed in a black suit and wearing sunglasses. The individual had skin as white as chalk and emanated an odor that made Robert Newson cringe.

One of the 999, Zachariah Redmond, made visits to various cities and towns in search of new members. Sheriff Willoughby introduced Robert, stating he’d be a fine addition to the team. Robert’s knees turned to rubber upon the realization that the enemy sat a few feet away. The sectarian nodded and asked for more coffee. Willoughby executed the order and filled the thin man’s cup.

“That’s enough, Willoughby! How much coffee do you think I drink? Sit down and let’s hurry. I have places to be, people to meet, and important things to do.”

“Right, sir. Sorry, sir.”

Robert couldn’t believe his eyes. Redmond pulled Willoughby’s strings as he wanted—a circus freakshow where the puppet did the puppeteer’s bidding.

“As I was saying, Willoughby. We had to dispose of Jim Marshall yesterday. The man was too much of a liability for the ecosystem. There are more like him, people who stay hidden and try to form resistance groups—a rebellion against the new system. The 999 will take care of any threat, don’t worry. Anyway, you’re telling me you and your guys can help push up the sales here in your area?”

Redmond laid out the operation plan. Willoughby’s team had to bring down the population from 2000 people to 500. The crazies, the junkies, the homeless and those above 75 years of age had to go first—the most vulnerable ones. The 999 would provide Ambrosia stock for free. Each member of Willoughby’s team would be compensated with $1.5 million dollars per 500 people who turned the lights off. The society would also do no harm to team members and families.

Robert’s migraine worsened. The sect demanded sacrifice, a harvest of souls, and death of the innocent. The 999 marched across America wearing business suits and combat boots, speeding up the apocalypse. The police officer knew the sectarians had set the gears in motion—such a plan could never be stopped. Insanity ate the sheriff’s mind, and the Bloom dust poisoned his lungs.

“That’s what I call an honest deal, Mr. Redmond! Glad to be of service!” the sheriff exclaimed.

“I’ll make the deal even better, Willoughby. If all goes well, our society would be more than happy to let the team join our ranks. Things have changed since the Sullivan events. I think those inside the society might be able to wait a bit longer to see dead family and friends. Now, if that is all, I’ll be on my way. On to the next city. There’s more work to be done. Be seeing you.” Redmond said.

The flesh on the sectarian’s neck moved as if tiny worms lived under it. Purple and orange stars flashed before Robert’s eyes. A slight dizziness brought a loss of balance in his legs for a moment. Luckily, the sectarian and sheriff didn’t see it.

“Mr. Redmond, can I ask you a question? What Jim Marshall said, is it all true? Do aliens walk among us now?” Robert asked.

“Yes. The creatures live in the dust sheltered from the human eye. Millions of them came here with the Bloom. This race of aliens wants to wipe out as much of humanity as possible, but the 999 managed to get a great deal done. The brilliant beings rule the earth now, and humans must obey. I think they’re doing us a favor—people get to see dead daughters, sons, mothers, fathers, and best friends one more time. With a leap into the unknown, users of Ambrosia can make it happen. It’s poetic and beautiful—a story with a happy ending,” Redmond replied.

“Thank you, Mr. Redmond. Just wanted to get my information first-hand from a trustworthy source,” Robert said. “What about establishing communication with the aliens? How did it happen?”

“We… managed to establish communication right after the event. The orange and purple dust particles swayed in the wind. Humans heard whispers in the air. The aliens have an intellect we cannot fathom to understand. They learned all languages in seconds. It’s impossible to describe the beings, but imagine a tall, thin figure made of light—weightless, floating around, moving in the air like embers from a fire,” Redmond said.

“I understand, sir.” Robert replied.

“Have you ever thought about taking Ambrosia, Mr. Newson? Yours is a tragic and gut-wrenching story, to say the least. I can’t even begin to understand how you must feel. If I remember things right, authorities never caught the drunk driver?”

“No, not once, sir. And they didn’t catch him, no.”

The police officer knew the drunk driver’s whereabouts —burial place, day and time of death, and type of gun used for the murder; a heavy burden Robert would have to carry forever.

“A strong man you are, Mr. Newson. It’s good you didn’t do it; the 999 needs you. Sheriff, the mayor’s on board too. I expect to hear good news in thirty days, yes?”

“Yes, sir. Absolutely.”

“Don’t disappoint us,” Redmond said.

The peculiar said goodbye and stormed out of the office. Robert peaked through the blinders to see a black sedan waiting outside the station. The driver’s face twitched as if the skin didn’t feel comfortable in its own body anymore.

“Why’d you ask him that, Robert?”

“Just curious is all. Listen, can I take the rest of the day off? My head’s killing me. I think I also have the goddamn stomach flu too.

“Go home and rest but be here first thing in the morning. Don’t be late. We have work to do. Sorry I surprised you like that, but I just knew I could count on you. We’ll stay safe and get rich. What more can you wish for in crazy times like these? Am I right?”

“You sure are, boss. I’m heading out.”

Robert got in his cruiser and went straight to Vince’s construction site. The police officer went inside his friend’s office; he was on the phone talking about a shipment of supplies for the company. The two best friends spoke about the encounter with Redmond, the plan the sect had for the town and the escape plan.

“Are you one hundred percent sure about this, Bob?”

“I couldn’t have made this all up. That man wasn’t right, if he was a man. I don’t know anything anymore. The whole world is burning. God damn it, this migraine is killing me, I feel like my head’s going to explode.”

Vince opened a desk drawer, took out a painkiller and gave it to Robert with a glass of water.

“Here, man. Take this and feel better.”

“Thanks, brother.”

“Go home, Robert. I’ll call my wife to pick up our daughter from school, and I’ll go load up the car. Then we’ll come to get you, alright?

“Since when do you call me Robert, dude? But yeah, sounds good. See you in a few.”

Robert packed clothes in a suitcase, put canned goods in a bag, dug up a stashed survival kit and grabbed his hunting rifle. The headache had not subsided—only worsened. A throbbing pain pulsated across his skull. The toxic air made breathing hard. He sat on the couch; his head tilted back, and sleep came easy. Purple and orange streaks adorned the skies in his dream.

“Daddy. Come here to us. We miss you,” his daughter, Julia, said from a distant place.

“Robert, I love you. We’re waiting for you,” his wife, Melanie, said.

Longing, relief and happiness overcame Robert Newson—a long gone family together once more. The man could breathe again; the headache vanished. The police officer wanted to see his girls again so badly. And with all the insanity in the world, it felt like the right decision—three souls blessed with purple-orange happiness once more.

“There’s nothing left for you there, my love. Only sadness and despair.”

The old world is gone, Robert whispered.

“Dad, we need you here. You won’t be lonely anymore. Please, come.”

Tears of joy streamed down Robert Newson’s face. Peace, and tranquility at last. His daughter came closer, her big blue eyes and blond hair sharpening into focus, a glowing halo surrounding her body—an angel made of light.

“Come on, dad. Take my hand and let’s go, please. You’re the only one missing.”

Robert Newson didn’t hesitate and wished for this sadness to end. The police officer’s mind exploded into a glowing purple and orange light.

His head tilted forward and fell on the cold rifle barrel.

“At last, I am at peace,” Robert thought.
