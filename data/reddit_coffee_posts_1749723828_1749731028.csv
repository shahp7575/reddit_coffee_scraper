Hi! üëã I've had this Monstera for a while now and I adore it! It's grown really fast, and I've let it spread out on my kitchen wall. Every morning when I drink my coffee, I just sit and admire it.
The problem is that for some time now, about three weeks, some of the leaves have started to turn yellow and dry out. I did a little research and found that this happens when it's overwatered, so I started watering it less frequently, about once a week or every week and a half. However, the problem hasn't gone away; the leaves are still drying.
I've included a photo at the end showing the general humidity I maintain where the Monstera is located. The pot is large; I repotted it half a year ago, but I haven't used any fertilizer. The plant is in my kitchen, facing east, getting enough light, but not direct sunlight. I'm not sure what the exact causes might be, so if you have any ideas, I really need your help, plant lovers! I don't want to risk losing it.

A lot of people quietly avoid smiling widely just because they aren‚Äôt happy with how their teeth look.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/hbyvd77ylh6f1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdba5531795e17b0f58d27e57143d329544c30d2

But what if your smile could be¬†*redesigned*? Not just cleaned or polished, but thoughtfully improved to match your face, your personality, and yes, your confidence?

That‚Äôs what smile designing is all about.

# What Exactly¬†Is¬†Smile Designing?

Smile designing is a¬†[**cosmetic dental treatment**](https://smylexl.com/cosmetic-dentistry-tips-for-a-brighter-smile/)¬†where multiple procedures are combined to improve the look of your smile. It‚Äôs not a one-size-fits-all fix. It‚Äôs tailor-made. Whether your teeth are discolored, chipped, uneven, misaligned, or too spaced out, smile designing focuses on correcting all those imperfections together.

Think of it like getting ready for a wedding at a parlour in Dwarka Nagar. They don‚Äôt just do your hair and send you off. They do your makeup, jewelry setting, and saree draping, which is the full package. That‚Äôs what smile designing is for your teeth.

# Who Really Needs Smile Designing?

You don‚Äôt need to be a movie star or model to consider smile designing. People from all walks of life choose it. You might relate if:

* You cover your mouth when you laugh
* You hesitate before posing for a photo
* You avoid social gatherings because you‚Äôre self-conscious about your teeth
* You‚Äôre preparing for a big life event, like a wedding or job interview
* You‚Äôve tried whitening or braces in the past, but still feel something‚Äôs missing

# What Treatments Are Involved?

Smile designing is not a single procedure. It‚Äôs a combination of cosmetic treatments based on your needs. Some common ones include:

* **Teeth Whitening**: For those stubborn stains from coffee or too much¬†*Ulava Charu*.
* **Dental Veneers**: Thin layers placed over your teeth to hide imperfections.
* **Braces or Aligners**: To straighten crooked teeth discreetly.
* **Gum Contouring**: If your smile shows more gums than teeth.
* **Crowns or Bonding**: To fix broken, chipped, or misshapen teeth.

The dentist will examine your teeth, facial structure, lip line, and even your speech pattern before planning the treatment.

# What‚Äôs the Cost Factor?

Alright, let‚Äôs talk about the number everyone wants to know but hesitates to ask out loud. The cost of smile designing depends on how many procedures are included. Some people may only need whitening and veneers. Others might need braces first, then veneers, and maybe even crowns or gum contouring.

At SmyleXL Dental Clinic, we first provide detailed consultations and then share a personalized treatment plan. The good part? You don‚Äôt have to do everything in one sitting or even in one month. Many people go step-by-step, depending on their comfort and budget.

If you can save for gold bangles or a new Activa, you can plan for your smile too. And this one lasts a lot longer.

# Will It Hurt?

This question always sneaks in quietly at the end. Thankfully, smile designing is more about planning and precision than pain. Most of the procedures are either non-invasive or involve minimal discomfort. And with advanced technology treatments like¬†[**veneers**](https://smylexl.com/dental-veneers-treatment-in-dwaraka-nagar/)¬†and bonding, teeth feel smooth and gentle.

Plus, the only pain you might feel is when you realize how many years you spent hiding that smile.

# A Quick Recap That Won‚Äôt Waste Your Time

If your smile has been bothering you for years, you don‚Äôt need to live with that discomfort anymore. Smile designing brings together whitening, veneers, braces, and other cosmetic treatments to fix what‚Äôs bothering you and give you a confident, natural smile. Whether you‚Äôre preparing for your wedding, a big presentation, or just want to feel better while eating¬†*Pesarattu*¬†in public without hiding your teeth ‚Äî this is one makeover that‚Äôs totally worth it.

And when you‚Äôre ready to take that step, feel free to book a consultation with our expert at SmyleXL Dental Clinic for¬†[**smile designing treatment in Dwaraka Nagar**](https://smylexl.com/smile-designing-treatment-in-dwaraka-nagar/)¬†to design a smile that finally feels like¬†*you*.",1,1749730146.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

The Law of Balance Protection
The Law of Balance Protection is an epic cosmic principle, like a best friend reminding you to keep things in life from going ‚Äúoffbeat.‚Äù It ensures that the Invisible World (spirituality, energy, those ‚Äúgoosebump‚Äù moments) and the Visible World (you, your phone, this morning‚Äôs beef noodle soup) stay in sync. The universe is basically saying, ‚ÄúHey, don‚Äôt overdo one side‚Äîkeep it balanced, okay?‚Äù This law operates through opposites like light and dark, giving and receiving, sowing and reaping, love and hate, resentment and gratitude, ensuring everything in the universe‚Äîfrom humans to cats, trees to the skies‚Äîlives happily and harmoniously.
1. What is this law?
Imagine the universe as a giant scale. On one side is the Invisible World‚Äîhome to spiritual energy, ancestral souls, and dreams about your crush texting you back at 2 a.m. On the other side is the Visible World‚Äîyou, your desk, your bubble tea, and your wallet crying because it‚Äôs almost empty. The Law of Balance Protection keeps this scale from tipping. If you only ‚Äútake‚Äù (like eating all your friend‚Äôs T·∫øt sticky rice cake without sharing), the universe might ‚Äúgently remind‚Äù you with a stomachache. Hold a grudge, and negative energy will keep you tossing and turning all night; practice gratitude, and life feels as light as getting a free bubble tea.
‚Ä¢  Funny example: You‚Äôve seen grandma offer fruits on the altar, then the family shares the blessed food, right? That‚Äôs her keeping balance: offering to the Invisible World (ancestors) and receiving joy in the Visible World (tasty food, family laughter). If she only offers without eating, or eats without offering, the universe might ‚Äútap her shoulder‚Äù with a chilly breeze through the window!
2. How the law works
This law is like a cosmic DJ, mixing tracks so both worlds dance in harmony:
‚Ä¢  Light and dark: Light is when you‚Äôre hustling deadlines, texting your crush, living your best life. Dark is when you let your soul chill, meditate, or daydream. If you only grind like a ‚Äúnight owl‚Äù scrolling TikTok until dawn, you‚Äôll crash like a phone at 1% battery. The law nudges: ‚ÄúYo, take a nap to recharge with some Invisible World energy!‚Äù
‚Ä¢  Funny example: Ever stayed up late binging a show, then woke up with panda eyes? That‚Äôs the universe warning: ‚ÄúNight is for rest, don‚Äôt overdo the light side, or I‚Äôll make you break out!‚Äù
‚Ä¢  Giving and receiving: When you give (like treating your bestie to bubble tea), you send positive vibes to the Invisible World. The universe ‚Äúpays you back‚Äù with, say, a free coffee from a coworker tomorrow. But if you only take (sipping that tea without a thank-you), the universe might ‚Äúsend a bill‚Äù in the form of‚Ä¶ an empty wallet!
‚Ä¢  Funny example: Ever treated friends to food but forgot your wallet, and someone covered you? That‚Äôs the universe ‚Äúbalancing‚Äù things for you‚Äîbut next time, bring your wallet, or the universe might charge ‚Äúinterest‚Äù!
‚Ä¢  Sowing and reaping ! 1. Does this law relate to a specific tradition (e.g., feng shui, Daoism, or a Vietnamese belief system)?
‚ÄúThe Law of Safeguarding Balance‚Äù appears to draw inspiration from multiple traditions, particularly those that emphasize harmony between the material and spiritual realms. Here‚Äôs how it connects to specific traditions:
‚Ä¢  Daoism (ƒê·∫°o gi√°o): The law strongly resonates with the Daoist concept of yin-yang, where balance between opposing forces (yin as the Invisible World, yang as the Visible World) is essential for cosmic harmony. The self-regulating mechanism of the law mirrors the Daoist belief that the universe naturally corrects imbalances, as seen in the Tao Te Ching, which emphasizes living in accordance with the Dao to maintain equilibrium.
‚Ä¢  Vietnamese Folk Beliefs: In Vietnamese culture, the practice of ancestor worship reflects a similar principle. Families honor their ancestors (Invisible World) through rituals to ensure blessings and protection in the Visible World (health, prosperity). This mirrors the law‚Äôs emphasis on maintaining a two-way interaction to safeguard balance. For example, during T·∫øt (Lunar New Year), Vietnamese families clean ancestral altars and offer food to ensure harmony between the living and the spirits.
‚Ä¢  Feng Shui (Phong Th·ªßy): The law aligns with feng shui‚Äôs focus on balancing energies (chi) between the physical environment (Visible) and unseen forces (Invisible). For instance, building a house in alignment with the ‚Äúdragon veins‚Äù (long m·∫°ch) ensures that the energy of the land (Invisible) supports the inhabitants (Visible). Violating these principles, such as placing a structure in a way that blocks energy flow, can lead to misfortune, reflecting the law‚Äôs self-regulating mechanism.
The law seems to synthesize these traditions into a broader metaphysical framework, emphasizing the protection of balance as a universal principle rather than being tied exclusively to one tradition.
2. Can you provide a specific example of how this law manifests in daily life (e.g., a spiritual event, ritual, or personal experience)?
Here‚Äôs a specific example rooted in Vietnamese culture that illustrates how ‚ÄúThe Law of Safeguarding Balance‚Äù might manifest:
‚Ä¢  Example: A Family‚Äôs Ancestral Ritual Gone Wrong
In a rural Vietnamese village, a family decides to skip their annual ritual of c√∫ng gi·ªó (death anniversary ceremony) for their grandfather due to financial constraints. This ritual typically involves offering food, incense, and prayers to honor the deceased (Invisible World) to ensure their spirit‚Äôs peace and the family‚Äôs well-being (Visible World). After skipping the ceremony, the family experiences a series of misfortunes: the father falls ill, crops fail, and the children have recurring nightmares. A local shaman (th·∫ßy c√∫ng) is consulted, who explains that the ancestor‚Äôs spirit became restless due to neglect, disrupting the balance between the worlds. The family quickly organizes a belated ceremony, and soon after, their fortunes improve‚Äîthe father recovers, and the nightmares stop.
This example demonstrates the law‚Äôs two-way interaction: neglecting the Invisible World (ancestor‚Äôs spirit) led to consequences in the Visible World (misfortune), and restoring balance through ritual corrected the imbalance.
This scenario reflects how traditional practices implicitly align with the law, ensuring harmony through intentional acts of connection with the Invisible World. 3. Can you connect this law to modern concepts (e.g., quantum physics, psychology) to find intersections?
Let‚Äôs explore how ‚ÄúThe Law of Safeguarding Balance‚Äù might intersect with modern concepts:
‚Ä¢  Quantum Physics:
Quantum physics offers a potential bridge to the law through concepts like quantum entanglement and the observer effect. Entanglement suggests that particles can be instantaneously connected despite vast distances, hinting at a deeper, non-physical (Invisible) layer of reality that influences the physical (Visible) world. The observer effect‚Äîwhere the act of observing a quantum event alters its outcome‚Äîparallels the law‚Äôs idea of two-way interaction: human actions (Visible) can influence the Invisible World, and vice versa. For example, if collective human consciousness (Invisible) affects physical reality (Visible), as some quantum theories speculate, this could be a mechanism through which the law operates. The law‚Äôs self-regulation might be likened to how quantum systems seek equilibrium, such as particles returning to a ground state after disturbance.
‚Ä¢  Jungian Psychology:
Carl Jung‚Äôs concept of the collective unconscious aligns with the Invisible World. Jung proposed that all humans share a reservoir of arche/ archetypes, and synchronicity (meaningful coincidences) reflect interactions between the personal psyche (Visible) and a deeper, universal consciousness (Invisible). The law‚Äôs emphasis on maintaining balance could be interpreted through Jung‚Äôs idea of individuation‚Äîthe process of integrating the conscious and unconscious to achieve wholeness. For instance, if a person ignores their inner world (Invisible‚Äîdreams, intuition), they might experience psychological imbalances (Visible‚Äîanxiety, depression), which could manifest as physical issues. The law‚Äôs self-regulating mechanism might parallel how the psyche naturally pushes toward balance, such as through dreams that surface repressed emotions to restore mental harmony.
These modern concepts suggest that the law could be a metaphysical framework for phenomena that science is only beginning to explore, particularly in understanding the interplay between consciousness and reality.
4. Can you analyze how this law might explain current issues (e.g., climate change, social conflict) from a metaphysical perspective?
Let‚Äôs apply ‚ÄúThe Law of Safeguarding Balance‚Äù to two pressing global issues:
‚Ä¢  Climate Change:
From the law‚Äôs perspective, climate change can be seen as a consequence of humanity‚Äôs overexploitation of the Visible World (natural resources, industrialization) without regard for the Invisible World (the spiritual energy of the Earth, often personified as Mother Nature or Gaia). This imbalance‚Äîprioritizing material gain over spiritual harmony‚Äîtriggers the law‚Äôs self-regulating mechanism. Extreme weather events, rising temperatures, and biodiversity loss could be interpreted as the Invisible World‚Äôs response to restore balance, forcing humanity to reconsider its relationship with nature. For example, indigenous traditions often warn against overharvesting, as it angers nature spirits (Invisible), leading to consequences like droughts or floods (Visible). The law suggests that to mitigate climate change, humanity must reconnect with the Invisible World‚Äîperhaps through rituals honoring the Earth or adopting sustainable practices that respect the spiritual dimension of nature.",1,1749729877.0,u_Green_Ad_4131,1,1.0,False

We started as colleagues, just working for the same organization. We didn‚Äôt even work in the same department. I‚Äôd see him (M36) in passing and we‚Äôd say hi. We then both quit working there, and ran into each other at a parenting group. He has 3 kids, one of which is only 2 years old, and I have a 1 year old. 
He struck up a conversation with me and they‚Äôve been casual for the most part. 
I sat down for coffee with him one day and we talked about all sorts of things. I told him I was a single mom, and that I‚Äôm back in school pursuing upgrading before I go into a bachelors program. He is also in school working on a bachelors program! And he‚Äôs also happily married to his wife. 
And I love this for him. I‚Äôve also met his wife, and she‚Äôs a wonderful person. I would argue she is even a friend too at this point, which is why I feel so guilty for feeling this way. 
After we met for coffee, and started seeing each other on a weekly basis at this parenting group, we started talking more frequently, and conversation has become more intimate (not s*xually, just more personal if that makes sense)
I feel terrible, recently I‚Äôve been having dreams about him and I having s*x. And I think about talking to him all the time. As embarrassing as it is to admit, when I get texts from him, I hope that it‚Äôs him wanting to sleep with me. 
I could never act on these feelings because I would never want to hurt his wife or interfere with his relationship. He is also now a very close friend who I have confided in and spoken to on a deeply personal level, and now even that seems like crossing a line based on the fact that I‚Äôm really s*xually attracted to him now. And I don‚Äôt want to lose our friendship, because it is very meaningful and important to me. I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends. 

The funny thing is, I‚Äôve recently gone through a pretty significant transformation. I lost 50 lbs, which started in March - I look better than I did pre-pregnancy and now I have men hitting on me all the time. These feelings I have for him don‚Äôt stem from any lack of attention or just some random need to have s*x. I wish they did though, it would probably make things easier. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for with this post. Maybe just trying to alleviate some of the guilt I have for feeling this way. Is there any way I can change these feelings or make them go away?

1l9kl1o,https://youtu.be/J_sgbkCsxok,3 Very Scary TRUE RV and Drifter Horror Stories,"# ""The Clearing"":

I never thought a family camping trip could become the most terrifying night of my life. It was supposed to be a quiet weekend, a chance to reconnect with the people I loved most, away from the hustle of our daily routines. Instead, it turned into a nightmare that haunts me every waking moment, a horror I can‚Äôt escape no matter how hard I try.

I‚Äôm Jane, 63 years old, and I was camping with my husband Carl, 77, our daughter Hannah, 40, her six-year-old son Kade, and Hannah‚Äôs boyfriend Thomas, 46, along with his sons, Nathan, 23, and Austin, 21. We‚Äôd chosen a remote spot near Tennessee Colony, Texas, about 100 miles southeast of Dallas. The land was breathtaking‚Äîtowering pine trees formed a canopy overhead, their needles carpeting the ground, while open fields stretched out, dotted with wildflowers in shades of yellow and purple. A small pond nearby reflected the sky, its surface rippling with the occasional splash of a fish. It felt like a slice of paradise, a place where we could breathe easy and just be together. We arrived Friday evening in a borrowed RV, an old clunker Carl‚Äôs brother had lent us, its paint chipped and tires worn. We set up two tents for the boys, their laughter echoing as they hammered stakes into the soft earth.

Saturday morning was pure bliss. I woke to the smell of coffee brewing over the campfire, the sizzle of bacon in a cast-iron skillet. Carl was already up, flipping pancakes with a goofy grin. ‚ÄúMorning, sleepyhead,‚Äù he teased as I shuffled out of the RV, rubbing my eyes. Kade was chasing a butterfly, his giggles infectious, while Hannah helped Thomas unpack fishing gear. Nathan and Austin were wrestling playfully near the tents, their shouts drawing a mock scolding from Hannah. ‚ÄúYou two, behave!‚Äù she called, but her smile betrayed her amusement.

After breakfast, we headed to the pond, rods and tackle boxes in hand. Kade was determined to catch ‚Äúthe biggest fish ever,‚Äù his small hands gripping his pole tightly. When he reeled in a tiny sunfish, no bigger than my palm, his face lit up like he‚Äôd won a prize. ‚ÄúLook, Grandma! I‚Äôm a pro!‚Äù he shouted, holding it up for everyone to see. Carl knelt beside him, gently unhooking the fish. ‚ÄúYou sure are, buddy,‚Äù he said, ruffling Kade‚Äôs hair. Thomas showed Nathan and Austin how to cast their lines farther, his voice patient but firm. Hannah and I spread a blanket on the grass, sipping coffee and watching the scene unfold. ‚ÄúThis is perfect,‚Äù she said, leaning against me. ‚ÄúWe need more days like this.‚Äù I nodded, my heart swelling with gratitude.

By noon, we‚Äôd packed up and headed for a hike. The trail wound through the woods, the air cool and heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth. Kade collected pinecones, stuffing them into his backpack until it sagged. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make a castle!‚Äù he declared, his eyes bright. Nathan and Austin raced ahead, daring each other to climb a fallen log. Thomas kept an eye on them, while Carl pointed out birds‚Äîa flash of red cardinal, the hoot of an owl hidden in the branches. We reached a clearing with a view of rolling hills, and we stopped to catch our breath, passing around a water bottle. ‚ÄúThis place is unreal,‚Äù Austin said, snapping a photo with his phone. I agreed, but something about the quiet felt too deep, like the woods were holding their breath. I shook it off, chalking it up to city nerves.

Back at the campsite, Thomas fired up the grill for burgers, the smoky aroma making our mouths water. We ate at a folding table, paper plates piled high with chips and coleslaw. Kade, his face smeared with ketchup, told a rambling story about a superhero fish, and we all laughed until our sides hurt. As the sun dipped low, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, we gathered around the fire pit. The crackle of burning wood mingled with our voices, and Kade nestled in Hannah‚Äôs lap, sticky with marshmallow goo. Carl launched into a tale about a bear stealing his fishing rod on a trip years ago, exaggerating every detail until the boys were howling. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre full of it, Grandpa!‚Äù Nathan teased, tossing a twig into the fire.

That‚Äôs when things took a turn. Earlier that day, our RV had gotten stuck in a muddy patch near the campsite entrance. We‚Äôd all pushed, the wheels spinning uselessly, mud splattering our clothes. Thomas was frustrated, muttering about needing a tow, when a man appeared, rumbling up on an orange tractor from the neighboring property. ‚ÄúLooks like you folks are in a bind,‚Äù he called, his voice carrying a friendly drawl.

We were beyond grateful. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a lifesaver,‚Äù Thomas said, wiping his hands on his jeans. The man hopped off the tractor and introduced himself as Bill, a local who lived on the land next door. He was in his early 30s, stocky, with a scruffy beard and a faded green baseball cap pulled low over his eyes. His flannel shirt was rolled up to his elbows, revealing tanned forearms. He hooked a chain to the RV and yanked it free in minutes, the engine roaring. ‚ÄúThank you so much,‚Äù Carl said, clapping Bill on the shoulder. ‚ÄúWe owe you one.‚Äù

Bill shrugged, a crooked smile tugging at his lips. ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt no trouble. Neighbors gotta stick together.‚Äù His eyes scanned the campsite, lingering on our setup‚Äîthe RV, the tents, the cooler by the fire. ‚ÄúYou all here for long?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust the weekend,‚Äù Hannah said, bouncing Kade on her knee. ‚ÄúFirst time camping here.‚Äù

Bill nodded, his expression unreadable. ‚ÄúGood spot. My family‚Äôs had land around here forever. Lots of history.‚Äù His voice dropped slightly on the last word, and I felt a flicker of unease, but it passed quickly. He seemed like a decent guy, just a local being kind. Carl, always the hospitable one, gestured to the fire. ‚ÄúStay for a beer? Least we can do.‚Äù

Bill hesitated, glancing toward the woods, then nodded. ‚ÄúSure, why not?‚Äù He grabbed a folding chair and settled in, accepting a cold can from Thomas. The conversation started easily enough. Bill talked about growing up in Tennessee Colony, how he‚Äôd hunted and fished these woods since he was a kid. He knew every trail, every creek, every hidden spot. ‚ÄúYou folks stargaze out here yet?‚Äù he asked, leaning forward, his hands wrapped around the beer can. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a clearing about a mile in. Stars are somethin‚Äô else‚Äîno city lights to ruin it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds cool,‚Äù Nathan said, sitting up straighter. Austin nodded, always eager for something new. Kade‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúCan we go see the stars, Mommy?‚Äù

Hannah glanced at her watch. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting late, sweetie. Maybe tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not far,‚Äù Bill said, his tone light. ‚ÄúQuick walk, in and out. I‚Äôd show you the way.‚Äù He looked at Thomas, who shrugged.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm up for it,‚Äù Thomas said. ‚ÄúWhat do you, boys?‚Äù Nathan and Austin were already grabbing their hoodies, excited. Kade bounced in Hannah‚Äôs lap. ‚ÄúPlease, Daddy?‚Äù he begged, turning to Thomas.

I felt that unease again, sharper this time. ‚ÄúYou sure it‚Äôs safe?‚Äù I asked Bill, trying to keep my voice casual. ‚ÄúKade‚Äôs only six.‚Äù

Bill‚Äôs eyes met mine, steady and calm. ‚ÄúSafe as my own backyard. I walk those trails all the time, day or night.‚Äù His smile was reassuring, but something about it didn‚Äôt sit right‚Äîlike it didn‚Äôt match the rest of his face. Still, everyone else was so enthusiastic, I didn‚Äôt push it. Maybe I was just being paranoid. Thomas, Nathan, Austin, and Kade decided to go with Bill to the clearing. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be back before you know it,‚Äù Thomas said, kissing Hannah‚Äôs cheek. Kade grabbed his flashlight, waving it like a lightsaber.

‚ÄúBe careful,‚Äù I called as they headed into the woods, their flashlights bobbing in the darkness. Bill led the way, his tall frame cutting through the trees. I watched until their lights disappeared, the knot in my stomach tightening. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be fine,‚Äù Carl said, squeezing my hand. I forced a smile, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling something was wrong.

Carl, Hannah, and I stayed by the fire. Carl was telling Hannah about his old camping trips, how he‚Äôd gotten lost once and wandered for hours. Hannah laughed, teasing him about his sense of direction. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre hopeless, Dad,‚Äù she said, tossing a stick into the flames. I tried to join in, but my mind kept drifting to the woods. The fire was dying down, the embers glowing faintly, and I was bone-tired from the day. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna rest,‚Äù I said, standing. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stay up too late.‚Äù

‚ÄúNight, Mom,‚Äù Hannah said, her smile warm. Carl winked at me. ‚ÄúSleep tight, hon.‚Äù I climbed into the RV, changed into flannel pajamas, and sank onto the narrow bed. The hum of crickets outside was soothing, and I drifted off, the day‚Äôs laughter still echoing in my mind.

Gunshots woke me. They came from the woods, sharp and relentless, cracking through the night like thunder. One, two, three, more‚ÄîI lost count. I bolted upright, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù I whispered, fumbling for my glasses on the bedside table. My hands shook as I pulled on my shoes, not bothering with socks. I stumbled out of the RV, the cold air hitting me like a slap.

Hannah and Carl were already on their feet, staring toward the trees. The fire was nearly out, just a faint glow of coals. ‚ÄúThose were gunshots,‚Äù Carl said, his voice low and tight. He gripped a flashlight, its beam shaking slightly. Hannah‚Äôs face was ghost-white, her phone in her hand. ‚ÄúNo signal,‚Äù she whispered, her voice breaking. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Kade? Where‚Äôs Thomas?‚Äù

The shots had stopped, leaving a silence that felt heavier than the noise. My stomach twisted, bile rising in my throat. ‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶ hunters?‚Äù Carl said, but he didn‚Äôt sound convinced. Hunters didn‚Äôt fire like that, not at night, not so many rounds. We stood frozen, listening for anything‚Äîvoices, footsteps, a cry. Nothing came.

Minutes dragged by, each one stretching my nerves tighter. Then, movement at the edge of the campsite. A figure stepped into the faint light of the coals. It was Bill, alone. His face was blank, his eyes dark and empty, like the man who‚Äôd laughed with us was gone.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my son?‚Äù Hannah demanded, her voice rising. She stepped forward, fists clenched. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Thomas? Nathan? Austin?‚Äù

Bill didn‚Äôt answer. He kept walking toward us, his boots crunching on the gravel. That‚Äôs when I saw the gun in his right hand, its barrel catching the dim light. My breath caught, my legs turning to lead.

‚ÄúBill, talk to us,‚Äù Carl said, stepping in front of Hannah. His voice was steady, but I could hear the fear beneath it. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

Bill stopped a few feet away, his gaze flicking between us like he was sizing us up. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt belong here,‚Äù he said, his voice flat, almost mechanical. ‚ÄúThis land ain‚Äôt yours. Never was.‚Äù

Before I could make sense of his words, he raised the gun and fired. The shot hit Carl square in the chest, a deafening crack that echoed in my ears. He collapsed, a wet gurgle escaping his throat as blood soaked his flannel shirt. Hannah screamed, a raw, animal sound that tore through me. She turned and bolted for the RV, her sobs choking the air.

Bill didn‚Äôt flinch. He strode after her, his steps deliberate, like he had all the time in the world. He kicked the RV door open, the wood splintering, and disappeared inside. I heard Hannah scream again, pleading‚Äî‚ÄúPlease, no!‚Äù‚Äîthen two more gunshots. The silence that followed was worse than the screams.

My body wouldn‚Äôt move. My mind was screaming, but I was paralyzed, kneeling in the dirt by the fire pit, gravel biting into my knees. Bill‚Äôs voice cut through the quiet, low and menacing. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre out there,‚Äù he called, his tone chillingly calm. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt hide forever. I‚Äôll find you.‚Äù

Panic snapped me out of my stupor. I had to hide, now. My eyes darted around the campsite, desperate for cover. The RV was too obvious‚Äîhe‚Äôd already been inside. The tents were flimsy, their canvas no protection. Then I saw it‚Äîa pile of folded camp chairs stacked against a tree, half-covered by a blue tarp, next to a stack of firewood. It wasn‚Äôt much, but it was my only chance.

I crawled toward it, my hands scraping the dirt, my breath coming in shallow gasps. I squeezed behind the chairs, pulling the tarp over me until I was completely covered. I curled into a tight ball, my knees pressed to my chest, my face buried in my arms. The smell of damp canvas and pine filled my nose, but I barely registered it. My heart hammered, every beat loud enough to betray me. I pressed my hand over my mouth, stifling the sobs threatening to escape.

Bill‚Äôs boots crunched closer, slow and deliberate. He was searching, tearing through the campsite. I heard the tents rip, zippers yanked open, poles clattering to the ground. He kicked over the cooler, plastic cracking, cans hissing as they spilled. ‚ÄúCome on out,‚Äù he said, his voice eerily soft, like he was coaxing a stray dog. ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt no point in hidin‚Äô.‚Äù

He moved closer, his steps stopping near the fire pit. I could hear him breathing, a steady rasp that sent ice down my spine. He checked under the RV, the chassis creaking as he bent down. Then he walked toward the chairs. I saw his boots through a tiny gap in the tarp, inches from my hiding spot. Dirt clung to the soles, dark and wet‚Äîblood? My stomach lurched. I held my breath, my lungs burning, my body trembling so hard I thought the chairs would shake.

He stood there, silent, for what felt like an eternity. Then he muttered something‚Äîangry, incoherent‚Äîand moved on. I heard him circle the campsite again, checking every corner, every shadow. At one point, he stopped and laughed, a low, guttural sound that made my skin crawl. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good,‚Äù he said, almost to himself. ‚ÄúBut I got time.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt move. I couldn‚Äôt. My legs were numb, my hands frozen, but fear kept me locked in place. Every rustle of leaves, every snap of a twig, made me flinch. Was he still there? Was he watching, waiting for me to slip? My mind raced, replaying the night‚ÄîBill‚Äôs smile by the fire, his offer to stargaze, the gunshots. Why had I let them go with him? Why hadn‚Äôt I trusted my gut?

Hours passed, each one stretching into forever. My body ached, cramped from staying curled up, but I didn‚Äôt dare shift. The night was alive with sounds‚Äîcrickets chirping, owls hooting, the faint creak of branches swaying. Each one felt like a trap, like Bill was out there, circling, biding his time. I kept seeing Carl‚Äôs face, the shock in his eyes as he fell. Hannah‚Äôs scream echoed in my head, joined by Kade‚Äôs voice, calling for his mom. Tears streamed down my face, soaking my sleeve, but I stayed silent.

As the sky began to lighten, a pale gray seeping through the trees, I dared to peek out. The tarp was stiff, crinkling faintly as I moved it. The campsite was still, the fire pit a pile of cold ash. The RV door hung open, swaying slightly. The tents were shredded, their contents strewn across the ground‚Äîsleeping bags, clothes, a crushed water bottle. I listened for footsteps, for Bill‚Äôs voice, but heard nothing but the faint hum of insects.

My body screamed to stay hidden, but I had to know if anyone was alive. I crawled out, my joints creaking, my hands trembling so badly I could barely push the tarp aside. I stayed low, inching toward the RV, my eyes darting to the woods. Every shadow felt like Bill, every sound his boots. I reached the RV steps and climbed up, my breath hitching.

Inside, I found Carl and Hannah. Carl lay sprawled near the door, his eyes open, unseeing. Blood pooled beneath him, dark and sticky. Hannah was slumped against the wall, her head lolled to one side, a bullet hole in her chest. I gagged, my hand flying to my mouth, and turned away. I couldn‚Äôt bear to search the woods for Thomas, Nathan, Austin, or Kade. Deep down, I knew they were gone, their bodies left somewhere in that clearing.

I grabbed my phone from the RV table, my fingers fumbling. By some miracle, I had one bar of signal. I dialed 911, my voice a ragged whisper. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a shooting,‚Äù I said, choking on a sob. ‚ÄúMy family‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre all dead. Please, hurry.‚Äù

The operator‚Äôs voice was calm, professional. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, stay where you are. Help is on the way. Can you tell me what happened?‚Äù I stammered through the story‚ÄîBill, the tractor, the stargazing, the gun. She kept me on the line, asking questions, but I barely heard her. My eyes were fixed on the woods, waiting for Bill to emerge, gun in hand.

Police arrived faster than I expected, their sirens piercing the quiet. Cars screeched into the campsite, officers swarming with guns drawn. A paramedic wrapped me in a blanket and led me to an ambulance, her voice gentle but urgent. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe now,‚Äù she said, but I didn‚Äôt believe her. I told the police everything, my words tumbling out in a rush. They found Bill at his mother‚Äôs house nearby, still holding the rifle. He didn‚Äôt resist, just stared at them with those empty eyes.

Later, I learned the truth. Bill had been consumed by rage over Thomas buying the land his family had lost years ago. He‚Äôd grown up on that property, hunted in those woods, and seeing us there‚Äîlaughing, camping, making memories‚Äîbroke something in him. He‚Äôd planned it, luring Thomas, Nathan, Austin, and Kade into the woods to kill them. Then he‚Äôd come back for Carl and Hannah. I was the only one who survived, because I‚Äôd hidden behind those chairs, too terrified to move.

The guilt is unbearable. Why didn‚Äôt I stop them from going with Bill? Why didn‚Äôt I trust that feeling in my gut? I see their faces every night‚ÄîCarl‚Äôs warm smile, Hannah‚Äôs laugh, Kade‚Äôs bright eyes, Nathan and Austin‚Äôs carefree grins. The sound of gunshots wakes me, the smell of blood lingering in my dreams. But knowing Bill‚Äôs locked away, that he‚Äôll never hurt anyone again, is the only thing that keeps me going. That, and the memory of that night, every detail etched into my soul‚Äîa reminder of how close I came to dying in those woods, and how I‚Äôll carry their loss forever.

  


# ""The Man at the Rest Stop"":

I was bone-tired, my eyes burning from hours of driving my RV, a beat-up but cozy rig I called Wanderlust, across the endless highways of Texas. I‚Äôd been living on the road for months, chasing freedom, but that night, all I wanted was sleep. I pulled into a small rest stop off the interstate, the kind you‚Äôd miss if you blinked. It was deserted, just a flickering streetlamp casting weak light over a cracked parking lot. The restroom building nearby was a mess‚Äîgraffiti scrawled across its cinderblock walls, one window boarded up, another shattered. A rusty trash can overflowed with soda cans and wrappers. No other cars, no other people. It felt off, but I was too exhausted to care. I locked the doors, double-checked the deadbolt, and crawled into my bunk at the back of the RV, the familiar creak of the mattress lulling me into a deep sleep.A loud thud ripped me awake. My heart slammed against my ribs, instant and hard, like I‚Äôd been shocked. I froze, holding my breath, straining to hear. Another thud, heavier, like someone pounding a fist against the RV‚Äôs aluminum side. The digital clock on the counter glowed 2:17 a.m., its red numbers cutting through the dark. My mouth went dry. I slid out of bed, my bare feet cold on the vinyl floor, and crept toward the small window above the sink. My hands shook as I pinched the edge of the curtain, peeling it back just enough to peek outside.A man stood there, right outside, staring straight at me. His eyes were wide, wild, like they didn‚Äôt belong in a human face, catching the streetlamp‚Äôs sickly yellow glow. His lips twisted into a grin, slow and sinister, showing stained, uneven teeth. My stomach churned, a wave of nausea hitting me. He raised a fist and banged on the window again, deliberate, each hit echoing in the quiet. Thud. Thud. Thud. The glass rattled in its frame, and I flinched, my heart racing so fast it hurt.‚ÄúHey, friend,‚Äù he said, his voice low, almost singsong, muffled through the glass but clear enough to make my skin crawl. ‚ÄúCome out, come out, wherever you are.‚ÄùI stumbled back, my hip banging into the counter. Pain shot through me, but I barely noticed. ‚ÄúLook, I don‚Äôt want any trouble,‚Äù I called out, my voice cracking, barely holding together. ‚ÄúJust leave me alone, okay?‚ÄùHe laughed, a sharp, jagged sound that made my blood run cold. ‚ÄúTrouble? Oh, there‚Äôs going to be trouble alright. But not for me.‚Äù He tilted his head, like he was studying me, his grin never fading. His clothes were filthy‚Äîa torn jacket, jeans streaked with dirt, boots caked in mud. He looked like he‚Äôd been living rough, maybe for years.Then I heard it: a sloshing sound, like liquid splashing against the ground. A sharp, bitter smell hit me, unmistakable‚Äîgasoline. My heart dropped into my stomach. I rushed to the other side of the RV, yanking open the curtain above the dinette. He was there, pouring a metal can of gas around the base of Wanderlust, the liquid glinting as it pooled on the asphalt. He moved slowly, deliberately, like he was savoring it. My breath came in short gasps. I pressed my hands against the window, my palms sweaty, leaving smudges on the glass.He looked up, caught my eye, and his grin widened. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a matchbook, holding it up like a trophy. ‚ÄúYou smell that?‚Äù he said, his voice louder now, taunting. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your home going bye-bye.‚Äù‚ÄúPlease, stop!‚Äù I yelled, banging on the window so hard it shook. ‚ÄúWhat do you want? I‚Äôll give you anything! Money, food, anything!‚Äù My voice was desperate, pleading, but I didn‚Äôt care. I just wanted him gone.He struck a match, the tiny flame flaring bright in the dark. ‚ÄúI want to watch it burn,‚Äù he said, his eyes locked on mine, unblinking. ‚ÄúYou gonna come out now, or you gonna cook in there like a rat?‚ÄùPanic clawed at my chest, my mind racing. I spun around, scanning the RV‚Äôs cramped interior. My phone was on the counter, but the signal was dead‚Äîalways was in places like this. I grabbed the fire extinguisher from under the sink, my hands trembling so bad I fumbled the handle, almost dropping it. The RV‚Äôs door was my only way out, but he was right there, circling like a wolf. I heard another match strike, then a soft whoosh as flames caught. Smoke curled up outside, thick and black, seeping through the door‚Äôs edges. The smell of burning rubber stung my nose, and the crackle of fire grew louder.I crouched by the door, my pulse hammering in my ears. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do this,‚Äù I shouted, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúJust take what you want and go!‚ÄùHe didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, I heard his boots crunching on the gravel, moving closer to the door. The handle jiggled, then rattled hard, like he was trying to rip it open. I gripped the extinguisher tighter, my knuckles white. The smoke was thicker now, making my eyes water, my throat burn. I had seconds, maybe less, before the fire spread.I took a deep breath, my lungs stinging, and made a choice. I unlocked the door, kicked it open, and aimed the extinguisher. He was right there, his face twisted with rage, his fist raised. I pulled the trigger, and a blast of white foam hit him square in the face. He screamed, a raw, furious sound, clawing at his eyes as he staggered back, tripping over the gas can. The flames were climbing higher, licking the RV‚Äôs side, the heat scorching my skin as I bolted past him.My bare feet hit the gravel, sharp rocks cutting into my soles, but I didn‚Äôt stop. I sprinted toward the highway, my arms flailing, screaming for help. My voice was hoarse, barely carrying over the crackle of the fire behind me. The rest stop faded into the dark, the flames casting an orange glow that lit up the night. I kept running, my chest heaving, my legs burning, until I saw headlights in the distance.A pickup truck slowed, its tires crunching on the shoulder. A woman, maybe in her fifties, leaned out the driver‚Äôs window, her face pale, eyes wide with worry. ‚ÄúGet in!‚Äù she shouted, throwing open the passenger door.I scrambled inside, collapsing onto the seat, my body shaking. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a man,‚Äù I gasped, words tumbling out. ‚ÄúHe tried to burn my RV! He‚Äôs still there!‚Äù‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù she asked, her voice tight as she glanced at me, then back at the road. ‚ÄúDo you need me to take you to the police?‚Äù‚ÄúYes, please,‚Äù I said, my voice barely a whisper. I twisted in the seat, looking back. Flames were swallowing Wanderlust, the RV‚Äôs frame glowing red against the night. The man was gone, melted into the shadows like he‚Äôd never been there.‚ÄúI saw the fire from the road,‚Äù she said, gripping the steering wheel, her knuckles pale. ‚ÄúThought it was an accident at first. Then I saw you running. Never seen anything like that in my life.‚Äù‚ÄúHe wanted to kill me,‚Äù I said, my hands trembling in my lap. ‚ÄúHe was pouring gas, lighting matches. I don‚Äôt even know why.‚ÄùShe shook her head, her eyes flicking to the rearview mirror. ‚ÄúSome people are just broken,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you got out.‚ÄùWe sped toward the nearest town, the truck‚Äôs engine rumbling, the highway stretching dark and empty ahead. My mind kept replaying his face‚Äîthose wild eyes, that awful grin. I could still smell the gasoline, feel the heat of the flames. My home, everything I owned, was burning back there, and I couldn‚Äôt do anything about it.We pulled into a small police station, its neon sign buzzing in the quiet. I stumbled out, my legs weak, and told the officers everything‚Äîthe banging, the gasoline, the matches, the man‚Äôs taunts. They listened, jotting notes, their faces grim. They sent a patrol to the rest stop, but by the time they got there, the fire had gutted Wanderlust. The RV was a blackened shell, its tires melted, windows shattered. They found the gas can, dented and empty, but no sign of the man. They figured he was a drifter, maybe someone living off the grid, preying on lone travelers at remote stops. No prints, no tracks, no way to find him.The woman who saved me waited while I gave my statement. Before she left, she pressed a piece of paper into my hand with her phone number. ‚ÄúCall if you need anything,‚Äù she said, her voice kind but firm. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to be okay.‚Äù I nodded, but I didn‚Äôt feel okay. I felt hollow, like part of me had burned up with the RV.I lost everything that night‚Äîmy clothes, my photos, my sense of safety. I kept seeing his face in my dreams, hearing his voice: Come out, come out, wherever you are. I don‚Äôt know why he chose me, why he wanted to hurt me. Maybe he didn‚Äôt need a reason. Now, when I talk to other RVers, I tell them what happened. I tell them to park in well-lit lots, near other people, to keep a phone charged, to trust their gut if a place feels wrong. That night changed me. It taught me the road can be beautiful, but it can also be cruel, and some dangers hide in the quiet places where you least expect them.

  


# ""The Bowl"":

I steered our RV into the sandy lot near Corpus Christi, a secluded stretch of beach known as ""The Bowl."" Dunes rose around us like frozen waves, and the ocean‚Äôs steady hum filled the air. My husband Tom and I craved a quiet weekend, just us, the sand, and the open water. Another RV was already parked nearby, a white rig with a faded blue stripe and a small awning pitched out front. Two cats peered from its window, their eyes catching the fading light. The owners, James and Michelle Butler, a retired Navy couple, waved as we set up. They had warm smiles, the kind that made you feel like old friends.‚ÄúFirst time here?‚Äù James called, walking over with a thermos of coffee. His gray hair was cropped short, and his t-shirt had a sailboat logo. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, brushing sand off my hands. ‚ÄúHeard this place is peaceful.‚Äù Michelle joined us, her locket swinging as she carried a folding chair. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our favorite spot,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNo crowds, just you and the sea.‚Äù Tom grinned, unloading our cooler. ‚ÄúSounds perfect,‚Äù he said. We chatted as we set up camp, their stories of RV trips across the country pulling us in. They‚Äôd seen mountains in Montana, deserts in Arizona, and beaches up and down the coast.That evening, we gathered around a campfire they‚Äôd built. The flames snapped, sending sparks into the dark, and the dunes cast long shadows that seemed to shift on their own. James poured more coffee, his voice steady as he shared a story about a whale-watching trip in Oregon. ‚ÄúThought the boat would tip, but Michelle just laughed,‚Äù he said, nudging her. She rolled her eyes, smiling. ‚ÄúYou screamed louder than me,‚Äù she teased. I sipped my cocoa, the mug warm in my hands. ‚ÄúYou two make it sound so easy, this full-time RV life,‚Äù I said. Michelle shrugged, her locket glinting. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs freedom,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou pick a spot, stay as long as you want, then move on.‚Äù Tom tossed a stick into the fire. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still figuring it out,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúBut this place? It‚Äôs got me hooked.‚ÄùWe talked until the fire died to embers, the ocean‚Äôs rhythm lulling us. ‚ÄúSee you in the morning,‚Äù James said as they headed to their RV, its windows glowing softly. Tom and I climbed into ours, the familiar creak of the door comforting. I fell asleep to the sound of waves, but around midnight, something jolted me awake. Voices, low and sharp, cut through the quiet. Not James‚Äôs deep chuckle or Michelle‚Äôs soft tone. These were different, urgent, like an argument bitten off mid-sentence. My heart thudded. I slipped to the window, easing the blinds apart. Two figures stood near the Butlers‚Äô RV, their shapes blurry in the moonlight. One was tall, a baseball cap pulled low over his face, his flashlight beam darting over the sand. The other, a woman with a ponytail, gestured sharply, her voice a hissed whisper I couldn‚Äôt make out. My stomach knotted. ‚ÄúTom,‚Äù I whispered, shaking him. He groaned, half-asleep. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù I pointed to the window. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs out there, near their RV.‚Äù He sat up, rubbing his eyes, and peered out. The figures were gone, the beach silent again. ‚ÄúMaybe just late-night walkers,‚Äù he mumbled, but his voice wavered. I didn‚Äôt sleep after that, my ears straining for every sound.Morning came, and the beach felt wrong, too still. I stepped outside, expecting to see James firing up his portable grill or Michelle tossing a ball for their cats. But their RV was quiet, the door slightly open, swaying with a faint creak. My chest tightened. ‚ÄúTom, come look,‚Äù I called. He joined me, his brows furrowed. We walked over, sand sticking to my sneakers. ‚ÄúJames? Michelle?‚Äù I said, knocking on the open door. No answer. Inside, their cats paced, meowing loudly, their food bowls empty. A coffee mug sat on the counter, half-full, next to a folded newspaper. Michelle‚Äôs locket, the one she‚Äôd worn last night, was gone from the table. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt right,‚Äù I said, my voice barely above a whisper. Tom scanned the RV, his jaw tight. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd they go? Their truck‚Äôs still here.‚Äù The pickup they towed was parked beside the RV, keys dangling in the ignition.We searched the beach, walking the length of the dunes, calling their names. ‚ÄúJames! Michelle!‚Äù My voice echoed, swallowed by the vastness. The sand was undisturbed, no footprints leading away. My unease grew, a cold weight in my gut. Around noon, near a pile of driftwood tangled with seaweed, I froze. Those figures from last night were back. The tall man in the baseball cap and the woman with the ponytail stood by a rusty pickup truck, parked just beyond the dunes. They were dragging something heavy, wrapped in a blue tarp, the kind you‚Äôd use for camping gear. It sagged in the middle, and they grunted as they hauled it to the truck‚Äôs bed. My breath hitched. ‚ÄúTom, look,‚Äù I whispered, pulling him behind a dune. He squinted, his face draining of color. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in that tarp?‚Äù he said, his voice low. The woman glanced our way, her eyes narrowing, and I ducked lower, my heart pounding so hard I thought it‚Äôd burst. The man slammed the tailgate shut, and they climbed into the truck, tires spitting sand as they sped off.Back at our RV, I couldn‚Äôt sit still. ‚ÄúWe have to do something,‚Äù I told Tom, my hands shaking as I poured water I didn‚Äôt drink. ‚ÄúThose people, that tarp‚Äîit‚Äôs not right.‚Äù He nodded, already grabbing his phone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling the ranger,‚Äù he said. He dialed, his voice steady as he explained: ‚ÄúOur neighbors, James and Michelle Butler, they‚Äôre gone. Their RV‚Äôs open, cats are alone, and we saw some people acting strange.‚Äù The ranger promised to send someone, but hours dragged by with no sign of help. I kept glancing at the Butlers‚Äô RV, the open door like a wound. Their cats‚Äô cries carried through the quiet, each one twisting the knot in my stomach tighter.That night, I couldn‚Äôt close my eyes. Every creak of our RV, every rustle outside, made me jump. I kept the blinds shut, but I swore I heard footsteps crunching in the sand, slow and deliberate. ‚ÄúTom, you hear that?‚Äù I whispered. He listened, then shook his head. ‚ÄúJust the wind,‚Äù he said, but he didn‚Äôt sound convinced. I clutched the blanket, imagining those figures outside, their flashlight sweeping closer.Two days later, police cars and ranger trucks swarmed the beach, their lights flashing against the dunes. A ranger knocked on our RV door, his face heavy with bad news. ‚ÄúWe found two bodies buried in the sand, about a mile from here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs James and Michelle Butler.‚Äù My knees gave out, and Tom caught me, his hands trembling. ‚ÄúBuried?‚Äù I choked out. The ranger nodded. ‚ÄúLooks like murder. Their RV was stolen, but we tracked it to Mexico. Caught the suspects driving it.‚Äù My mind flashed to the tall man, the woman with the ponytail, the tarp sagging in their hands. I felt sick, my throat burning.We packed up that afternoon, our movements frantic. As I folded our chairs, I spotted something glinting in the sand near our site. It was Michelle‚Äôs locket, half-buried, its silver chain tangled in seaweed. I picked it up, my fingers shaking, and opened it. A tiny photo of James and Michelle on their wedding day stared back, their smiles frozen in time. Tears stung my eyes. I handed it to the police, my voice breaking as I explained where I‚Äôd found it.We haven‚Äôt camped since. The Bowl was supposed to be our escape, a place to breathe free. Instead, it‚Äôs a nightmare I can‚Äôt shake. I see those figures in my dreams, their shadows stretching across the dunes. I hear the cats‚Äô cries, sharp and desperate. I think of James‚Äôs laugh, Michelle‚Äôs locket, and how fast it all vanished. Tom and I stay close to home now, sticking to crowded parks if we travel at all. The open road doesn‚Äôt feel free anymore‚Äîit feels like a trap, waiting for strangers in the dark to turn paradise into horror.",1,1749729455.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

So I have a diagnosis of ADHD-I which I've had since 2022. It mainly presents as me being very impulsive, unmotivated, anxious, dopamine-seeking (in all of the wrong places), and extremely low self-esteem.

  
I have tried stimulants and am currently titrating again on Elvanse, but I'm not taking it consistently and sometimes not at all - I have taken it consistently in the past though. I really don't like how it makes me feel, which makes me question my diagnosis because everyone else seems to have this life changing moment and get their life back on track etc. 

I really wish that was the case for me. 

Instead I get more anxious, insomnia and I am highly irritable. It does help with motivation, but I get super fixated on things. I don't work currently so the things I get fixated on are usually not that productive. I did have an ASD assessment and following it we decided that it was inconclusive as I don't really have special interests, and I do understand jokes, sarcasm etc. However, when I got asked what I did after school, I answered ""I went home, had my tea and watched TV"" lol. I do sometimes feel like I have the response a lot of people with ASD have when they try stimulants - I'm suddenly unable to mask everything as well as I normally can.

Am I being stupid not taking them, and potentially not giving them long enough to work and for the side effects to die down? I'm so afraid of stimulants and the effects on my heart, but when I'm unmedicated all I do is drink coffee and alcohol - the latter not every day, but more than I should. Both of which likely have worse effects on the heart than a prescribed medication.

  
Anyways, I'd just like some input and despite being a sensitive person I'm open for someone to just be like stop being a fool and take those meds. I'd also like to hear from people who've had similar experiences with meds and being anxious about taking them. 

  
Thank you in advance! ",2,1749729392.0,ADHDUK,5,1.0,False

 Although you have recently moved in together at her big house due to her insistence (she basically forced you into it).

 One day its a very busy day at the company and she is stressing out. Dealing with investors, lots of paperwork and sometimes incompetent employees which makes her want to scream until at some point her assistant Jenny walks in tells her that she has a surprise visitor.

 She asks who it is but the visitor didnt give his name but instead gave Jenny the name Baby Boy which makes her flustered and nearly spit out her coffee. 

She tells Jenny to let him in and then asks her to leave afterwards and she says ok. She opens the door and her boyfriend walk in smiling wearing a suit he got from her which both of them blush.

 She tells Jenny to leave and she quickly leaves. 

Lydia is happy to see him and she showers him with kisses and asks him why did he come. He tells her that he felt like she needed some company since he heard how stressed she was getting from her time as ceo and she goes awwww. 

He also tells her that he wanted some attention and so she gives him some kisses and she tells him she loves him very much while also babying him which makes him blush and giggle. 

She asks him how was the place they moved in together and he says the house was so big it makes his childhood home look like a shack and she says well I have a lot of money. 

She gets serious and asks him that did any female employees looked at him funny, because if any girl looked at him with even the slightest of flirty she will fire them but he tells her no one did and he only loves her which makes her more relieved and calm. 

He asks her if the employees know about their relationship and she tells him that they dont matter since their relationship is their own thing and she admits there have been rumors that the domineering ceo has found someone special but she tells him that they dont matter since he is the only one that matters to her and she kisses him again. 

She asks him if he needs anything from money, new clothes to fancy jewelry but he puts his finger on her lip and tells her that he just wants her which makes her giggle. She babys him telling him that he is the best thing to ever happen to her.

 He asks what was she like before they met and she tells him that she used to be cold, domineering and ruthless. 

She couldn't stand people taking advantage of others and she hated that people only saw her as a walking wallet. She even tells him that some of her relatives tried getting money from her to which she hated that.

She explains that everything changed after she met you, you never asked for anything in return after you saved her from those thugs and while she was upset and pissed that you rejected her but she is glad everything worked out in the end but then she once again apologizes for kidnapping and ruining your life. 

You tell her that its ok and she explains that she is working on rebuilding your life she destroyed and it seems things are working out for both you and her.

 She tells you the dates you been on together have some of the best dates shes been on, from the nice restaurant downtown to just cuddling on the sofa together. 

She then states she had heard about some people from his past have been trying to contact him and he asks her how did she know that and she calmly says that put a tracker on his cell phone which doesn't surprise him and he says hes trying to handle without bothering her since she has a lot on her plate but she tells him that their a couple now and he can tell her anything and he tells her that hes ignoring them since they didnt care about him before and she agrees telling him that they only care about him now since he acquired wealth. 

She really wants to spoil him and it irritates her that he doesn't want to be spoiled telling her that she is the only one he needs which flusters her and she kisses him some more and she gets flirty with him.

She tells him that no matter what he will always be her good boy, even if he refuses her money.

 To her surprise he asks her for a job at her company and she asks him why and he says they can be close almost all the time and she agrees but she tells him he will have to work his way up since she can't play favorites and he agrees. She asks him if this is really what he wants and he says yes, he wants to not only stay close to her but also help her company and she goes awww. She checks her clock and realizes its lunch time and so she wants to grab lunch so not giving him an option she made a reservation to a fancy restaurant in town and she drags him away not letting him get a word in.

The short of it is that my mom picked up a grifter after my dad died 6 years ago. 
 He convinced her to buy a property together and the deed was put on both of their names, with the understanding that it would be developed and run by them as a business and home to retire in.  She sold her home and put more that 3/4 of the financial contribution for the property. 
He sold his little house, paid to move their furniture and put some money toward the new place.  Since then he has claimed the master suite, has no romantic relationship with her, drained my mom's finances and lies in his bed texting her for coffee or food, or to buy pain/sleeping pills for him.
It has been at least 2 years since he's brought in any income and 6 months since he's confined himself to his room.
Although he's only made snide and nasty remarks to her until now, he had a complete rage fuelled breakdown this morning.  He stormed out of his room, screaming at her and yelling for her to pack up and get off of his land.  He has many guns all over the property and mom is terrified to go home.
He REFUSES to work or sell up, despite having only mom's pension to live on, which doesn't meet the upkeep of the property. 
Mom believes that he will either take himself out, or her, or the both of them.
Can I get him removed from the property?  Will the police help? Can we get him hospitalised?  Are there ANY emergency and long term measures that we can take?",4,1749729248.0,askSouthAfrica,2,1.0,False

I debated posting in here again, but at the end of the day a chance for some help is better than not asking. My [first attempt](https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1l3gnp9/qcrit_adult_contemporary_fantasy_wrong_turn_80k/) at this didn't get any actionable feedback, so instead of blindly reworking it, I'm posting another version of the query letter I had. It follows a much stricter format, which is why I veered away at first (wanted to try and add some voice). Opinions on structure and clarity over premise is what I'm aiming for, but any feedback is welcome! Thank you!

I've also added the first 300 words this round, just to see!

Dear NAME,

I am seeking representation for my novel, WRONG TURN, an adult contemporary fantasy complete at 80,000 words. It will appeal to fans of Tracy Higley‚Äôs, *Nightfall in the Garden of Deep Time*, Emma T√∂rzs‚Äô, *Ink Blood Sister Scribe*, and Matt Haig‚Äôs, *The Midnight Library*. This book is a standalone novel with series potential.

Unemployed, old enough for people to question why she‚Äôs unmarried and childless, and spouting smoky magic from her fingertips,¬†Billie Haywood¬†just wants¬†to learn about her new magic and get over her wicked hangover from the worst night out of her life. When¬†Billie finds a sketchy note in the woods guiding her to a magical boarding school,¬†she¬†uses her newfound magic to forge a degree and secure a position at the school. Now,¬†Billie¬†can get paid *and* learn about her magic in private.

After settling in as the new librarian,¬†the school reveals its own magic and, in turn, a life Billie doesn't remember, including her new boss as a cranky past lover, her rare healing power, and her intense hangover being caused by her actual death and revival by a mythical medical serpent.¬†When¬†she gets caught digging by her boss, she learns she's the center of a quiet battle of good and evil with a sneaky leader enticing her with the knowledge she needs to master her magic and remember everything.¬†But when¬†Billie discovers neither side wants her to join and instead falsely believes she's some kind of chosen one, she must figure out how to stay out of it¬†or¬†or risk being a tool on a shelf or killed, again.

\[BIO\]

\[SIGNATURE\]

FIRST 300:

What was a lady to do with wisps of black fog radiating from her fingertips?

Billie waved the smoky magic away from the sprinklers in frantic swipes. Gray magic didn‚Äôt equal smoke, right? She blew a dark spiral away from her face and wafted it down towards the cracked tile floors. She had seen magic up close and personal once, long ago. Her grandfather lifted a blanket over her grandmother with a flick of the wrist, but it was a colorless blur from his hand. The good kind. Even with outdated stereotypes broken, she couldn‚Äôt just parade around with a gray shadow.

The magic sputtered like the exhaust of an old car. Her jerky movements grated the pounding behind her eyes. Leaving her apartment was a bad idea, but her hellish hangover demanded coffee and her coffee maker was packed away in storage.

A deep breath rattled through her chest, a spurt of nausea tagging along. Billie dropped her arms to her sides. The gray colors of the magic faded, leaving a crystal clear and very rough version of herself in the mirror staring back. She never could handle a night out in her twenties. Why would she think she could at thirty?

She pressed down on the bathroom countertop, a sparkling white marble to contrast the deep navy walls and chipped golden fixtures. The magic, her magic, was nowhere to be seen. Panic settled on uneven ground, but a small smile rose to her lips. The last thing she wanted to do was pull a fire alarm and make her escape. It was hard enough to convince the police she hadn‚Äôt done it last time. The excuses were no longer in her.",1,1749729162.0,PubTips,1,1.0,False

I'll cut to the chase though, im taking 200 mg daily now for Bipolar Disorder (after a recent episode that left me in hospital), and the main issue I've been facing so far is horrible constipation.
 

I will be backed up for days, 3 days before I notice on quite a few occasions (bearing in mind I cant really remember much of the time I've been on it very well). When I first realised this was going to be an issue i switched to an almost entirely fibre diet temporarily which didnt help, I am using sienna and dulcolax and coffee and nicotine, and need to wait another week to get a dulcolax prescription.


So far this is the biggest problem I've had with the medication. It takes two days out of my week, one where I've got cramps from constipation, and the following day where I have to go to the toilet every 10 minutes for hours on end. Does this nightmare end?


Aside form this I'm concerned about the long term side effects of using it. This is the most stable I've ever been after a long episode, I've actually managed to not ruin my life which is amazing, but I dont really want to be on it for a long time at all. After two pretty serious episodes in the space of 8 months, I can really risk going off it before summer time or my next term of university after that. Its sucks so much but I dont want to be on them for valid reasons. But my episodes are getting worse with time, that alongside substance abuse problems, my brain feels like its rotting.


It's incredible how much my personality has changed over the last 5 or so years, for the better but also for the worse, I am rude and impulsive, brash and confident, but ultimately a loser. Maybe this stuff is my saving grace but I'm also aware that its a very serious drug with common serious long term side effects.",1,1749729047.0,seroquelmedication,1,1.0,False

We started as colleagues, just working for the same organization. We didn‚Äôt even work in the same department. I‚Äôd see him (M36) in passing and we‚Äôd say hi. We then both quit working there, and ran into each other at a parenting group. He has 3 kids, one of which is only 2 years old, and I have a 1 year old. 
He struck up a conversation with me and they‚Äôve been casual for the most part. 
I sat down for coffee with him one day and we talked about all sorts of things. I told him I was a single mom, and that I‚Äôm back in school pursuing upgrading before I go into a bachelors program. He is also in school working on a bachelors program! And he‚Äôs also happily married to his wife. 
And I love this for him. I‚Äôve also met his wife, and she‚Äôs a wonderful person. I would argue she is even a friend too at this point, which is why I feel so guilty for feeling this way. 
After we met for coffee, and started seeing each other on a weekly basis at this parenting group, we started talking more frequently, and conversation has become more intimate (not s*xually, just more personal if that makes sense)
I feel terrible, recently I‚Äôve been having dreams about him and I having s*x. 
I could never act on these feelings because I would never want to hurt his wife or interfere with his relationship. He is also now a very close friend who I have confided in and spoken to on a deeply personal level, and now even that seems like crossing a line based on the fact that I‚Äôm really s*xually attracted to him now. And I don‚Äôt want to lose our friendship, because it is very meaningful and important to me. I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends. 

The funny thing is, I‚Äôve recently gone through a pretty significant transformation. I lost 50 lbs, which started in March - I look better than I did pre-pregnancy and now I have men hitting on me all the time. These feelings I have for him don‚Äôt stem from any lack of attention or just some random need to have s*x. I wish they did though, it would probably make things easier. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for with this post. Maybe just trying to alleviate some of the guilt I have for feeling this way.

They have a generous refer-a-friend scheme where you earn a **free ¬£50 credit** when you switch your energy to them. You're eligible if you have a smart meter, standard meter or economy 7 meter but you‚Äôd need to switch both your gas and electricity. Another plus: NO FEES if you decide to switch out elsewhere at any time!

**How to get your free ¬£50 bonus with Octopus Energy:**

1. [Sign up to Octopus using my ¬£50 refer-a-friend link here](https://share.octopus.energy/quiet-mouse-344)
2. Enter your post code and answer questions about your current energy use to receive a price quote. Click ""Sign me up"" to see the details about the proposed tariff, then confirm the switch once you‚Äôre happy.
3. Enter your gas and electricity meter ID/serial numbers, so have an old bill ready as this info will be on there already. Octopus is brilliant at updating you via email on the whole process with what you need to do at each step.
4. Your ¬£50 reward will be credited to your account after your first direct debit has been taken - I received mine 2 weeks after the direct debit.

**My hot tips:**

* When getting your quote, enter your ‚Äúactual‚Äù energy usage using an old bill instead of choosing the ‚Äúlow, medium, high‚Äù options to keep your direct debit payments accurate
* In your online account, you can reduce your monthly direct debits if you think they're too high - I lowered my mine by about 70%!

**My experience + timeline:**

I switched from Shell Energy to Octopus as it worked out cheaper across the board for both gas and electricity, so the ¬£50 switch reward was a total bonus. The ¬£50 was applied to my account less than 2 weeks after my first direct debit was taken and the switch process was probably the smoothest I‚Äôve ever experienced. If you have a smart meter, you can also claim a free Caffe Nero or Greggs coffee each week as a free perk. Another plus: NO FEES if you decide to switch out elsewhere at any time!

1l9k8jx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l9k8jx,"Shobi MEGA REVIEW! (16 different Shobis vs other competing clones for the same frags), all matured for at least 5 weeks!","Trailer: Shobi made a **BIG** flop on one of them! Keep reading to find out which one.  

**first** let's get this out of the way: All Shobis **bottle design** get a 5.5/10 (bad labeling and 100% transparent, meaning 0 UV blocking), all their atomizers get a 7.0 (pretty good for non-pressurized...8.0 is the highest any non-pressurized can get from me). So I'll only score those for the non-Shobi's that are full bottles (but most of the competing clones are decants).  

 Now, to address how I define ""synthetic"". To me, that means the opposite of ""photo-realistic"". Like when you drink Fanta, you don't expect it to taste like orange juice. I'm fine with synthetic when the notes themselves are synthetic (man made), like caramel, Bubblegumy sweetness, etc. But when it comes to something I can smell in nature (lavender, fruits, herbs, etc) it makes it smell like a room spray or a cleaning product. I expect my fragrances to smell higher quality than my shampoo, soap, and detergents.

As for **""value score""** (see photos attached), it's going to be difficult, as the shipping price will depend on where you're from. I will calculate it as North America, converted to USD, for the 100ml bottles (to better compare to middle eastern clones), with 3ml extra essence, and as if I max my order for every shipping tier (under 80), and after FedEx are stealing 10 CAD from me for ""handling fees"" (which didn't happen to me with other US sites I've ordered from). All divided per bottle of maxed out order.  
That means, when they get to my door, all their ""low tier price"" are about $30 average total (good price for nuclear performance, but not for average performance), and all their ""medium tier"" are  about $50 average, which is VERY expensive (that's why I usually avoid that tier). The reason I still mainly buy from them, is the 50ml bottles. Though not cheap per ml, still much cheaper to collect many, and I'm at a point I'll probably never finish all of them. If you're from Europe, you pay less for shipping, and no FedEx theft, so bump up the Shobi value score by 1.0.  

Now let's start with ones I **don't have** competing clones of and **never** smelled the OG of (100% blind buy):

#Shobi THE NOIR 29 (50ml+3ml)  
Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiig! If you like fig, this will be right up your alley. This is ripe, syrupy, creamy fig.  

 I got this as I loved The Matcha 26, Liam Grey, and Wulong Cha (all fig+tea, then different other notes). This though, is probably 70% fig extract or something. I can barely feel the rest of the notes, and I'm not sure how I feel about it. I think it's just my skin than does it though, because in the air, it's more complex and balanced, but once on my skin, only the sweet fig pops out. I'll try and mix it with another fragrance and see how that works.  

 This is also the first time I disagree with Parfumo. Usually, their ""style"" chart (male/female) is almost spot-on for my unisex limit, and I can even go 3%-4% towards the female lean, and still don't think it's too fem leaning. This one has a 6% male lean on the chart, and I find it about 10% too fem leaning for me. 

 Performance is freakishly crazy. I sprayed 1 spray behind each ear (so 2 total, as I'm one of those people with 2 ears) before I went to bed, and woke up twice in the middle of the night from how strong it was. My advice: if you grab it, take 1ml to 50ml tops... Maybe even 0 essence will be safer. I might be to blame here for making it too dense with that much extra essence, and that might be the reason I'm not getting other notes. I can't know this for sure though, as I never tried the OG or any other clone for this DNA.

 The quality is good, just like all Shobis are after maturing.

 **Subjective Scent Score**: 7.4  
 **Longevity**: 9.8 (14 hours on skin, God know how long on clothes).    
 **Projection**: 8.8 (bordering nuclear the first 2 hours, then strong sillage for 4 more hours, then low silage for 2 more hours).    
 **Blind buy safety score**: 5.0 for men, 7.5 for women. VERY sweet, and if even I find this too sweet, that means 95% of you will find it way too sweet.  
 **Unisex Score**: 60%-65% feminine leaning.  
 **Value Score**: 6.5. it's almost 2X the price of their low prices tiers for no good reason.  
 **Conclusion**: Only get it if you **KNOW** you like that profile, and don't go with too much extra essence like I did.  

#Shobi Ultra Zest (50ml+2ml extra essence)
This was one of those that changed a LOT from day 1 to now. It was a complete mess, and I really hated it. A few weeks later, and now it's pretty good. Not top 5 by any means, but much smoother and rounder.   

 It opens up with a burst of blood orange, and 2 minutes later some patchouli and a hint of vanilla and coffee. Yes, sounds really strange, and smells really strange if you smell your wrist from 0 distance. But... In the air (4"" distance or further) it's really nice. Like a mature and versatile orange creamsicle, but slightly denser. This could be worn all year round. As it dries down (1 hour), you get more of the vanilla, Tonka, coffee, and the blood orange stays as a background, balancing it, and making it slightly fresher. This is the part I enjoy the most, and this will heavily weigh the average score, as this part last the longest. 

 On the ""Shobi scale"" this one slightly underperforms. But that just means it's above average compared to most middle eastern clones, and my performance scale is objective.   

**Subjective Scent Score**: 8.2    
 **Longevity**: 8.0 (8.5 hours)  
 **Projection**: 7.8 (1ft-2ft the first hour, then a medium scent bubble for 2-3 hours, then slowly dissipates to skin scent).  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 7.0 (a very unique profile)   
 **Unisex Score**: 60% masculine leaning.  
 **Value Score**: 8.5. Low price tier, and there are no competing middle eastern clones.  
**Conclusion**: Only recommended if you know you like unorthodox profiles.

#Shobi Pure Tonka (50ml+3ml extra essence)
LOVED this from day 1, and it only got better with time!   

You get Sa-MASHED in the face with a Tonka, cacao, and some coffee and vanilla, then 30 seconds later, you'll get a hint of lavender and a sprinkle of mint. It's sweet, delicious, Gourmand, yet balanced, and almost sophisticated. I know it sounds versatile... It isn't! This is still a dense and sweet winter profile... And those are my favorite kinds of profiles!  

 In the deep dry-down (1-1.5 hours), you'll get some patchouli and licorice... But you'll have to really search for them and know they're there to actually notice them. Those I wrote about only after looking in the notes breakdown and trying to sniff them out.  

 If you liked Le Male Elixir, Victory Elixir, and those sort of fragrances, you'll almost certainly enjoy this one too. This kind of reminds me of tuxedo DNA, but made sweeter, more youthful and slightly more playful. Also more unisex. It's also kind of like a more wintery Gourmandy version of Rochas Man (which I own), but only 40%-50% similar... So not redundant at all.

 I think I should've gone with 1-2ml extra essence instead of 3, because longevity is eternal, but the projection isn't ""Shobi nuclear"", just ""very good"" (which is just a ""Shobi above average""). I don't need a 12 hours fragrances... I prefer nuclear and 8-10 hours. Oh well... You live and you learn. In any way... Finally a full blind buy that actually makes it into my top 5 (winter), so I'm VERY happy with it, as I'm usually not lucky with blind buys.

**Subjective Scents Score**: 9.3   
 **Longevity**: 9.2 (12 hours)  
 **Projection**: 8.6 (2ft-3ft first hour, 1ft-2ft 2nd and 3rd hour, then a large scent bubble that slowly dissipates to skin at about hour 6-7) 
 **Blind buy safety score**: 8.6 (Gourmands with nothing offensive)  
 **Unisex Score**: 55% Male leaning.  
 **Value Score**: 9.5, because there is no other clone of it (at least not that I know of).  
 **Conclusion**: Highly recommend for Gourmand and vanilla/tonka lovers.  

#Shobi Wulong Cha (50ml+3ml)
 Amazing!   
If you got to know me by my previous reviews, you know I'm not a fan of heavy citrus notes, so I was kind of hesitant to order it, and that's why I got 50ml (with 3ml extra essence). Boy, was I wrong. Turns out it's just Armaf's shitty synthetic citrus that ruined it for me, and it can actually be amazing when done right! Right from the top, you are blasted with photo-realistic citrus, including pulp and skin, but blended so well, that it feels like the wind blew it towards you. Immediately (10 seconds) after, a full bathtub if tea joins the party, but it's not sweetened with sugar, oh no, it's sweetened with a small slice of ripe fig, while the nutmeg adds some warmth and spiciness to your experience. On the dry-down, it's even better, as the citrus subsides, but stays in just the right amount to balance it. I think it ties with Silver Mountain Water, but beaten by The Matcha 26. This is the most nuclear out of them though

**Subjective Scent Score**: 8.5  
 **Longevity**: 9.4 (12-14 hours)   
 **Projection**: 9.6 (room filler for hours... Top 1 percentile in projection)  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 8.7  
 **Unisex Score**: Gender Free.  
 **Value Score**: 8.3. It's a medium tier, but there are no competitors.  
 **Conclusion**: very safe, yet unique profile, that will stand out in your collection.  

#Shobi Apple Brandy On The Rocks (50+5)
To be honest, I knew I'm not going to fall in love with it, and my expectations were accurate. It's kind of boring. Small amount of brandy and a SHIT TON of green tart apples. It's like someone is waterboarding you with green apple juice. It's not bad, but not special at all. I am going to find a use for it though, by mixing (not layering, but mixing in a decant) 10% of this, with 90% Detour Noir, so I could finally make Detour Noir what I always wanted...A more apple-y Detour Noir. Question is, what I'm I going to do with the rest of it? Good thing I only got 50ml. The quality is good, and performance is great... But it's more of a one-note-spray than it is a fragrance. Could be my fault for being extra essence greedy... But I'm not going to reorder and find out, as I didn't enjoy this type of apple anyways. I like sweet red Apple.

**Subjective Scent Score**: 5.8  
 **Longevity**: 9.2 (11 hours)  
 **Projection**: 8.4 (high, not nuclear)  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 7.5   
 **Unisex Score**: 60% Male leaning.  
 **Value Score**: 8.0. there's Mawj Appletini as a competitor, but I haven't tried it yet (decant on the way).
 **Conclusion**: Great value if you like that profile.

#Shobi Paradise Garden (50ml+2ml extra essence)
This one needed a WHILE to mature. I HATED it after 4 weeks, but now (about 16 weeks in) I *kind of* like it. I also found out it's just me, and others who have it say it's VERY close to the OG. This was what made me realize I don't like Tonka in freshies. Same with Al Dirgham Limited Edition. Only when I had both, and compared the notes, I realized that's what's bothering me. Love the fig and mint combo, but don't like how the coconut and tonka work with them. The good news... You get guaranteed performance.

**Subjective Scent Score**: 7.3  
 **Longevity**: 8.8 (9 hours)  
 **Projection**: 8.6 (strong, not nuclear)  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 8.7 (I'm a weirdo about tonka in freshies... You'll probably like it).  
 **Unisex Score**: 55% Male leaning.  
 **Value Score**: 8.5. Low price tier, great performance, and competing clones are more expensive and perform worse (but only from what I've heard).   
 **Conclusion**: A great offering I can recommend even though I'm not a fan.  


  #Shobi 1 Million Elixir+ Spicebomb Extreme mix I made  
It all started when I blind bought a 50ml+2ml extra essence Spicebomb Extreme (SBE from now on). I REALLY didn't like the profile (I give it a 3.0 on a good day). I never smelled the OG, but this smells like a spent the night at a restaurant's kitchen while I lit a vanilla scented candle to (unsuccessfully) try and cover all the other scents. My wife also despised it, but that's no surprise, as our taste in scents is 98% similar (the only one we don't agree on is the A*Men profile).
Luckily, my mother-in-law really liked SBE on herself, so I decided to gift it to her.
Earlier that month, I made about 12 new mixes in 2ml decant bottles (like I do every month) and let them rest a few weeks before I test them. My usual success rate with is about 20% (""success"" is when the mix is better than BOTH the frags that comprise it, and perform about the same). One of those were that SBE, and a 1 Million Elixir (1ME from now on) clone from Shobi (50ml+2ml extra essence), mixed in a 1 to 1 ratio, and rested it for 2 weeks.
As soon as I sprayed it on my wrist, I got this angelic music played inside my head. It instantly became one of my top 3 winter frags! Now SBE doesn't smell like I spent the night at a restaurant kitchen, and 1ME is more mature, more male leaning, and more balanced. SBE toned down the rose dosage in 1ME I wasn't a fan of by about 60%, and 1ME almost complete eliminated (about 80% elimination of) the pepper and cumin in SBE. It also performs just as well as the 2 frags separately (this very rarely happens with mixes, and it's my main point of failure with them).  

My wife says it's the best winter frag I have now (beat Mercedes Club Black, after none other have), but I still think Mercedes Club Black and Khamra Qahwa are better. It's much more versatile than Khamra Qahwa though.  

You know how you find something that ""wow"" you, and you keep ""chasing the dragon"", trying dozens more frags, and they never beat or replicate that wow again? This one did it.
  
If you're gonna repeat this (which I highly suggest), don't forget to let it rest 2-3 weeks after you mix it.  

**Subjective Scent Score**:9.5  
 **Longevity**: 9.0 (10 hours)  
 **Projection**: 9.1 (nuclear)  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 8.5  
 **Unisex Score**: 55% Male leaning.  
 **Value Score**: 9.0. Low price tier with great performance, of 2 fragrances that's hard to find clones of.  
 **Conclusion**: This stuff... You want this stuff.   

  #Now, FINALLY, it's time for CLONE BATTLES!  


#Shobi 1 Million Lucky (50ml+2ml) vs Cuba Royal Fortune. Winner: You won't believe it!
FINALLY, I can prove I'm not a Shobi shill! This is the worst Shobi I've got so far. A $9 Cuba frag actually performs better, and lasts longer. Not that the Cuba is a beast by any means, but the Shobi is SO weak, I can barely smell it even 5 minutes after I've sprayed it!  

 I thought ""no way, this can't be... I'm probably just going nose-blind"", asked my wife which wrist smells better and stronger every hour (while her eyes are closed, and she doesn't know which wrist goes first), she chose the Cuba every time, and also said the wrist with the Shobi is weak, and she can barely smell it.

 No need for a scent profile review... Get Cuba Royal Fortune and over-spary, you'll come up way ahead, and only spend $9 to test the profile, while getting 100ml of it. I'm sad, but also happy, because I finally have an objectively bad Shobi. The rest I gave a low subjective score to, can just be bad profiles for my liking that I blind bought. But this... This isn't good for anyone!  

**Subjective Scent Score**: 8.2  
 **Longevity**: 4.0  
 **Projection**: 3.0  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 8.4  
 **Unisex Score**: 60% Male leaning.  
 **Value Score**: Shobi 2.0. Cuba 8.5.  
 **Conclusion**: If you like this profile, get something else! If you want to test the profile, get Cuba Royal Fortune as a 100ml ""decant"" for $9.  


Shobi Insense Ultramarine (100ml+3ml) vs OG. Winner: Shobi
Love this one from opening till deep dry-down. Watermelon is one of my favorite notes (that's why I was willing to pay Nitro Red ""big money""). IU is the only male-leaning unisex that has fruity fresh top notes, FLORAL (yes, floral) middle notes, and woody and tobacco base notes. This crazy concoction somehow creates an amazingly clean\fresh blue aquatic, that is both unordinary and extremely versatile at the same time. You can wear it with a full tux, shorts and flip-flops, and everything in between and it will still smell right for the occasion. Because of its floral mid and woody base, it can actually work from 10‚Å∞c, all the way to the highest heat and humidity possible. The only time I wouldn't dare to wear it is the harsh part of winter in Canada (so, 2 months a year). The downside with the OG is longevity. About 4.5 hours, with maybe 45 minutes of medium projection. You can bump it up to maybe 5 hours and maybe 1 hour of projection of you spray like crazy. But even then, the projection won't be anything to write home about. Shobi solved this. The clone is only about 80% close, but I only notice it because I wore this scent for over 20 years... You probably won't notice it much. Projection and longevity doubled, so it's a worthy trade-off for me.

 **Subjective Scent Score**: 8.8 (I found a few that beat it in the last year or so... Used to be a 9.5).  
 **Longevity**: 8.5 (9 hours)  
 **Projection**: 8.8 (bordering nuclear)  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 9.0  
 **Unisex Score**: 55% Male leaning.  
 **Value Score**: Shobi 8.8... No clones exist, and the OG sucks in performance. OG 7.0... Not expensive, but bad performance.
 **Conclusion**: Do me a personal favor and try it out... It deserves much more love than it gets, and it's much better than most of the other Blues out there.  


#Shobi Bleu Elecrique (50ml+2ml) vs OG. Winner: Unclear.
First of all, for those who don't know this profile, this is a very safe, well-balanced, gentlemany, aromatic, slightly sweet, safe scent profile. For me, it plays the summer/versatile role of what Asad plays for winter. A more mature scent profile than what I usually go for. I pick it when I don't want to blend into the crowd, but also don't want to stand out too much. I'll never go gaga for it, but never find it too boring. One of my most versatile scents. I tried Al Nashama Caprice at a friend's house, and liked it a lot. It was a hint sweeter than the OG, but about 90% close.

 I got only 2 sprays of the OG left... These went on the left wrist, 1 spray Shobi on the right wrist (because decant spray isn't equal to a Shobi atomizer spray). Waited 15 minutes for initial dry-down. 

 Wow, these two are REALLY close... I'd say also 90% close. Quality-wise, the OG is slightly higher, but not by the margin I thought it would be. Scent-wise, Shobi's version is a tiny bit fresher, while the OG is slightly more sweet-aromatic. But the differences are so small, that in the air, they are 90% the same. After dry-down (1 hour), they're almost indistinguishable. If you like the OG, this will DEFINITELY scratch your itch. This time though, Shobi isn't nuclear. The performance beats the OG though.

**Subjective Scent Score**: OG=8.5, Shobi=8.2  
 **Longevity**: OG=6.3 (6-6.5 hours), Shobi=8.1 (8-8.5 hours)   
 **Projection**: OG=7.1, Shobi=7.8.   
 **Blind buy safety score**: 8.7  
 **Unisex Score**: 65% Male leaning.  
 **Value Score**: 7.7, as there are many competing middle eastern clones, like Al Nashama Caprice. And after fractional shipping on Shobi, it's about the same price per 100ml.  
 **Conclusion**: if you're already making a Shobi order, then get it if you were planning to, but don't make a full order just for this one. Also, get Al Nashama Caprice if there's a good sale on it instead. If I remember correctly from the one time I've tried it, it matches or Shobi's performance.  

#Shobi Virgin Island Water (50ml+2ml) vs Coconut Lagoon. Winner: Shobi.
Yes, I know, Coconut Lagoon is not a 1:1 clone, but a sweet+watermelon twist on the DNA... But that's what I have to work with right now. So...  

**Opening**: I can guarantee you Coconut Lagoon also has some tonka added that VIW doesn't have, because I have this sensitivity to Tonka in freshies, that I can recognize it anywhere. The coconut note on Shobi is higher quality, more realistic, and a tiny more prominent. The lime in Shobi is more photo-realistic as well, and less sugared (but at this case, I slightly prefer the sugared one in Coconut Lagoon).  

 **Side note**: This one I can tell that I was just on the edge of ruining the profile if I would've added 1ml more extra essence. So just know you should stick with that level (1ml for 30ml, 2 for 50, 4 for 100). This will give you the best concentration without throwing the scent off balance. Maybe I'm wrong and you can add more (at your own risk), but definitely don't add less. It was too Lime-y on the first 2 weeks, but then balanced out fully at around week 3-4.

 Dry-down (1 hour): Now the two are very far from each other. Shobi's keeps the lime, and stays almost linear, and Coconut Lagoon becomes sweeter, loses the lime and tonka, and the watermelon is more noticeable. I prefer coconut lagoon from this stage of progress and onwards, because I just love aquatic watermelon and sweet scents.  

 Performance-wise, Shobi wins. From just before the 2nd hour and onwards, Shobi can be smelled from about 8"", and Coconut Lagoon is a skin scent by then. In the ""Shobi performance scale"", this one isn't amazing... But still better than the competitor. In an objective scale, it's way above average, but not a beast. 

 **Subjective Scent Score**: Coconut Lagoon 9.1, Shobi 8.5.  
 **Longevity**: Coconut Lagoon 7.0 (7 hours), Shobi 8.7 (8.5 hours)  
 **Projection**: Coconut Lagoon 7.1, Shobi 8.1  
 **Blind buy safety score**: Coconut Lagoon 7.8, Shobi 8.5  
 **Unisex Score**: Coconut Lagoon 55% fem leaning, Shobi 55% male leaning.   
 **Value Score**: Shobi 8.0, Coconut Lagoon 6.8 (Lagoon is more expensive and weaker performing)  
 **Conclusion**: Shobi is highly recommended, safe blind as well (if you know you're okay with coconut notes).  

#Shobi Invictus Victory Elixir (50ml+2ml) vs Fragrance World Invicto Victorious Elixir. Winner: Shobi.
This will be an easy one to compare, as it's a very simple scent profile.  Mostly vanilla, a bit of pepper, and a bit of incense. One of my favorite profiles, but not top 5.  

 Scent-wise, they're pretty much indistinguishable in the opening. 1 hour in, the Invicto is already a skin scent, and the Shobi can still be smelled from about 8"" away, but not further. That's weird, because I remember Invicto had much better performance when I tested it 8 months ago. Not nose-blind because I confirmed everything with my wife.

I can't really compare them because the Invicto is pretty much gone. I'm a little disappointed, as this is a profile that should easily be done to nuclear level. If you're getting it, bump up the extra essence to 10% (yes, 5 for 50ml). That's what I'm gonna do. It's a heavy profile, so shouldn't be a problem. I might try a different clone though and not get a Shobi at all (Embratur Elixir and Armaf Admiral come to mind). Maybe I'll buy no clone at all, because I got better vanilla frags (Pure Tonka, Mercedes Club Black). 

**Subjective Scent Score**: Both 8.7  
 **Longevity**: Invicto 3.0 (less than 2 hours), Shobi 7.8 (7.5 hours)  
 **Projection**: Shobi 7.3 (medium first hour, then medium-low silage for another 2 hours), Invicto 6.0.  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 8.5   
 **Unisex Score**: 65% Male leaning.  
 **Value Score**: Shobi 6.5, Invicto 4.0.  
 **Conclusion**: Will use and over-spary, but not sure I'll recommend it, definitely not at this concentration.  


#Shobi Silver Mountain Water (50ml+3ml) vs CDN Sillage vs Al Absar Saqar Platinum vs Dossier Musky Green Tea. Winner: (probably) Shobi.

Let's start with a recap of the profile: Tea, musk and citrus is what you'll mostly get here. And because I LOVE tea notes, I love this profile. This was the first profile that beat my Wulong Cha that starred as my #1 freshy for a WHILE.  

 **Quality ranking: Dossier 9.8, Shobi 8.2, Saqar Platinum 7.5, CDN Sillage 6.4**  

As usual, Armaf blasts with their signature synthetic citruses, that can push harder than everyone else, but not at all photorealistic, and more in a room spray quality. Shobi smells better blended, rounder, and more natural. Saqar Platinum is not bad, but not great. Dossier did an AMAZING job, and smell like luxury... Not even a contest. Yes, there are slight nuanced differences between them, but if you liked one, you'll like them all. The most significant difference is that in the deep dry-down (3 hours), Shobi loses most of the citrus, and the sandalwood somehow developed some type of sweetness to it. I like it, but it's veering the most out of the SMW DNA in the deep dry-down. 

 **Subjective Scent Score: Dossier 8.7, Saqar Platinum 8.0, Shobi 8.2, CDN Sillage 7.6**   
Saqar Platinum isn't a straight up clone, but a twist, and I like the slight green element it adds to the profile, and the white tea instead of green tea. It's about 75% similar to the others in the opening. I enjoy smelling the Dossier the most, just because of the quality, roundness, and smoothness that makes it so enveloping. CDN Sillage's dry-down isn't great, kind of screechy (less than the opening, but still screechy).  

 **Longevity: CDN Sillage 8.8, Shobi 7.8, Saqar Platinum 7.1, Dossier 4.2** which pretty much disqualifies Dossier.   

 **Projection: CDN Sillage 9.0 (room filler), Shobi 8.4 (very good), Saqar Platinum 7.0 (average), Dossier 4.0 (weak)** and Dossier is disqualified again.    

 **Blind buy safety score**: 8.0 for all of them. Very easy going freshy. Not ranked higher just because some people are very sensitive to a ""metallic"" note here.  

 **Unisex Score**: 60% Male leaning.  

 **Value Score: Saqar Platinum 8.5 ($16 on fragranceNet!!!), Shobi 8.0, CDN Sillage 7.0, Dossier 6.0**    

 **Bottle design: Shobi 5.5, Saqar Platinum 7.7, CDN Sillage 9.0**  

 **Atomizer Score: Shobi 7.0, Saqar Platinum 2.0** (with Saqar platinum, you need 28 sprays to get 1ml!)   
 **Conclusion**: This is a hard one. If performance is what you're after, Armaf and Shobi. If you're after quality, Dossier is in a different league, but you'll have to reapply every 40 minutes. If you're okay with spraying 18+ sprays because the atomizer is shit, and want a slight twist, then Saqar Platinum will be the best value. I think Shobi is the best one to get, as that way you get a non-screechy clone (*cough* Armaf), that performs well, for a pretty low price.   


#Shobi The Matcha 26 (50ml+3ml) vs Dossier Citrus Matcha. Winner: Shobi.
Welcome to my (newly) #1 favorite frag!  
 This is literally PERFECTION. The epitome of what I would define as the perfect calming summer-spring-fall scent in the world! Not too much citrus, creamy sweet fig and cedar, and a hefty dose of Matcha tea that carries a ""foamed"" airy quality to it. As it dries down, a hint of Vetiver appears, and the entire blend somehow attains a cinnamony quality to it (even though it's not in the note breakdown). I know it's a summer frag, but I can see this working even at winter.  Sweet but balanced? Check! unique? Check! unisex? Check! Versatile? Check! A perfect profile, with perfect versatility. What you read is what you get. The complexity doesn't come from the note breakdown, it comes from how they blend together into a deep and beautiful creation. Both of them capture the exact same profile. 0 detectible differences in composition.  

**Quality: Shobi 9.3, Dossier 9.5**. Just like Shobi is almost always a step above in quality over middle eastern clones, so is Dossier almost always a step above Shobi, and 2 steps above middle eastern clones. But they are both amazingly good and natural smelling. Dossier is ever so slightly more airy and diffusive. This time though, Shobi is closer to Dossier's quality more than any other test (LUCKY ME!), so close, that my wife couldn't tell the difference.   

**Subjective Scent Score**: Shobi 9.7, Dossier 9.9.  
**Projection: Shobi 8.6, Dossier 7.3**. Finally, a Dossier that actually performs averagely. Shobi wins, with 2ft projection though.  
**Longevity**: Shobi 8.8 (9 hours), Dossier 7.4 (7.5 hours)**. Again, Dossier isn't a total letdown with this one.  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 8.5 if you're okay with unisex leaning fem and sweet.  
 **Unisex Score**: 60% feminine leaning.  
 **Value Score**: Shobi 9.9 (low price tier), Dossier 8.5.   
  
 **Conclusion**: My previous #1 summer frag (Nitro Red) ruled the top for about 150 frags that I tested after it. Let's see how long The Matcha 26 can hold its spot. If you're okay with a slight fem lean (maybe 5% more fem than vintage Radio), then I wholeheartedly recommend you try this one.  

#Shobi Neroli Portofino (50ml+2ml) vs Dossier Neroli Reviera. Winner: Neroli Reviera (my fault though)
I KNEW IT! This was my review of Neroli Reviera:  

""This is the first neroli scent I actually enjoy. Describing this fragrance in one word is easy: ""Delicate"". Gentle citruses (which I'm not usually a fan of, but work very well here), hidden florals (of course, Neroli), and an herbal backbone. These create a unique and fragile mix of uplifting, mood boosting, and heavenly aroma. This is like a vacation in a scent. It's also completely unisex, because the notes aren't very feminine, but the ""prettiness"" they mix into makes it feel like a women's touch, running her fingernails gently across your back. This is much more like a luxury soap on vacation than Aqua Dubai.  

 Anyways... The con here is the performance. I'm afraid this time strengthening a Shobi clone of this won't do it, as I'm afraid this scent is too fragile and will smell completely different if I'll do that. I have to give it a shot though... And I will!""  

 I was right... I got ""extra essence greedy"" and ruined it. Please learn from my mistake and get 0 extra essence with this one, as even with 2ml, this is TOO nuclear. Yes, you've never heard me saying that about a scent, and probably never will again, but this thing still projected after a shower! While the Dossier version kept that fragile balance in check and was beautifully blended, my greed made the Shobi one a Neroli punch to the face, and the base notes were muted almost throughout the entire duration. Decided to test again at a day with no training session, so I could not shower until next morning and see how long this thing last, because it just won't quit! I still like it, but it's only a shadow of what it could've been if I wouldn't have ruined it.

**Subjective Scent Score**: Dossier=9.1, Shobi=7.8  
 **Longevity**: Dossier=3.5, Shobi=9.5 (13 hours).  
 **Projection**: Dossier=5.0, Shobi=8.9 (bordering nuclear, and for over 5 hours that way, then average projection for another 4-5 hours, then slowly dissipates into a skin scent).  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 8.0.   
 **Unisex Score**: Perfectly unisex.  
 **Value Score**: Shobi 9.0, if you get the right concentration and not ruin it. Neroli Reviera 6.0, more expensive, worst performing but better at cloning and quality.
 **Conclusion**: Should've gone with 0 extra essence. Gonna order another one in my next order and update.  

**And nowwwww, for the main event of the evening.

#Shobi Blue Talisman (50ml+2ml) vs Lattafa Art Of Universe vs Bujairami Enforcer. Winner:

First let's talk about the obvious, Lattafa isn't a ""clone"" per se, it's a sweeter take on the DNA, like what Coconut Lagoon does to Virgin Island Water. So, if you prefer your fragrances hyper-sweet, this will be your winner. If you prefer it more versatile and more balanced, don't even consider Lattafa. If you're looking for a clone closest to 1:1 OG, REALLY forget about Lattafa.   

 **What's common**:   
 The profile is not your normal Blue freshy. Pear is the main player here. Citruses play a supporting role to the pear, and some mint... But greener mint, like with the stem. The base of is a blue soapy clean background. This is an absolute gem of a creation, so versatile as well... I can see it working anywhere, any season. This broke into my top 5 summer/versatiles for a summer-spring rotation. Might even be in the top 3.  

 Dry-down has the same vibe, but better blended and more cohesive... Now I can barely tell the notes from one another... Just smells like a fruit luxury soap, maybe some floral notes somewhere in the background. Still love it just as much!

**Differences**:   
For Lattafa, amp up the sweetness by 20%-30%. So, if you're the type of person that like their fruit salad with added sugar/honey/syrup, Lattafa is for you. If you like it as is, get one of the other two. The Bujairami and Shobi are 95% the same as each other in the opening, where the 5% difference is that the fresh notes are 5% stronger on Bujairami, and the fruity notes are 5% stronger on Shobi. Now, this isn't a very obvious difference, so it's not like you're going to love one of them way more than the other... But it is noticeable. With Lattafa, you will definitely have a very distinct preference vs the other two.    
 
 **Quality**:   
Lattafa 7.0... It's a little more synthetic (which doesn't bother me in these types of profiles), and it's a little more ""in your face"", not only because of the sweetness, but the way it projects all the notes at once for the first 30 minutes. The other two are more layered, and the notes all have their defined roles, not playing all at the same volume.  
Shobi 8.5... More cohesive and structured, but more linear than both. The opening and dry-down are only slightly different, and it resemble more to just the dry-down of the others.   
Bujairami 8.3... Maybe a tiny hint less blended than Shobi (but it's also a less nature fragrance, so might be that) which makes the ginger smell a bit like saffron. But I really had to look (smell) deep for that one, and it's actually a pretty nice twist.  

 Surprisingly, they all perform very close to one another.  

 **Subjective Scent Score**: Lattafa 9.0. Shobi 8.4. Bujairami 8.2. Yes, I almost always prefer a sweet synthetic twist... Sue me!   
 **Longevity**: Lattafa and Shobi 8.0 (8 hours), Bujairami 9.0 ( 10 hours on skin, even a shower didn't take it off)   
 **Projection**: Lattafa 7.8, Shobi 7.2, Bujairami 8.3. The Lattafa is more noticeable in the air, because of the sweeter profile... But the Bujairami reaches a further distance. All of them have medium-high projection for about 1-2 hours, then a medium-large scent bubble for another 1.5-2.5 hours, with Bujairami getting the top numbers here, and Shobi the lower ones (Lattafa I'm between).  
 **Blind buy safety score**: Lattafa 7.5, Bujairami and Shobi 8.5. Again, you need to like high sweetness levels to like Lattafa.  
 **Unisex Score**: Lattafa 55% male leaning, Shobi 65% male leaning, Bujairami 65% male leaning.  
 **Value Score**: Lattafa 7.3 ($36), Shobi 6.8 ($42 for 100ml+3ml extra essence including fractional shipping to Canada), Bujairami 8.5 for me (because I got the last bottle on sale for $22 on fragranceNet) and 7.2 if you order at Bujairami's website for $37 (including fractional shipping) for 100ml. 
 **Bottle design**: Shobi 5.5, Lattafa 5.0 (ugly, but at least it's UV blocking and easy to recognize), Bujairami 9.6 (the most beautiful bottle in my collection! I don't like the scent of Aether Extrait, but if I had it, that would be what I consider a 10.0 bottle)
 **Atomizer Score**: Shobi 7.0, Bujairami 9.0 (pressurized, or at least feels like it).   
 **Conclusion**: Art Of Universe was out of stock after I've tried a decant... And stupid me didn't wait, and decided to ""Chase the dragon"" and hope I like the clones that aren't twists just as much. Learn from my mistake, if you like a twist, and you know it's a twist... An accurate OG clone is considered a ""half blind buy"". Not that an 8.3 average (Shobi+Bujairami)/2 is bad... But it's not a 9.0.  

**Wife Alert**: Wife prefers the Shobi and the Bujairami a LOT better than Lattafa. She says the Lattafa ""smells like a generic deodorant... Which is okay, but not worth it"", while she likes the other 2 better (with no preference between the 2). So at least she's a lot happier that I didn't go with Lattafa... And she's the one who's going to smell me the most, so that's much more important to me than a 0.6 score difference.

#Final Shobi conclusion  
I was lucky with my first few Shobi orders, as now I see they're not all nuclear. I still stand by my original review of them as a superior clone house, because on average, they still match or exceed (mostly exceeds) about 80%-90% of my Middle Eastern clones (170 clones tested) in performance, and match or exceed (again, mostly exceeds) their quality, for the same or lower (mostly lower) price. Also, they are rarely any stock issue or ""hype tax"", and no stupid ""sign up"" coupons that are not really sales. So, Shobi is the safest bet, unless you 100% know a Middle Eastern (or any) clone that performs great, priced well, and stays in stock. There aren't many like these, Ramz Silver and Royce Black are two examples though. Also, Shobi is the best option if you're not looking for 100ml for everything. You'll pay more per ml, but still less overall per bottle, so I'm gonna stay with them for most of my purchases. I just need to control my ""extra essence greed"". If Dossier were performing like Shobi, while keeping the Dossier quality, I would gladly pay double the price for them! And that's something you won't hear me say often... I'm a cheap-ass buyer, always chasing the deals. But unfortunately, Dossier are making horrible performing frags almost exclusively.  

So the true conclusion is we need to stop being influenced by greedy brands/influencers, open our minds and give a chance to non-ME clones, especially when they're priced like ME clones (and lower). Of course, that doesn't mean we should completely ignore ME clones, as sometimes they aren't greedy and release good bangers for a non-hyped price... But this rarely happens these days with new releases, and I think that's because they saw they gained market share and became greedy. If we'll keep them on their toes, we might not only get the ""good times"" back, but also support small brands that aren't crazy rich and fly influencers to Dubai on our dime, because we agreed to pay for that by ordering what should've been a $25 clone for >$50. As always, money is the enemy of honesty. That's why I'll never do tiktok or insta, and if I'll ever do YouTube, I'm not gonna review fragrances, just put information about collecting and how to spend less money doing it.

Im international student majoring Electrical Engineering, currently incoming sophomore in SUNY Buffalo. Im thinking of applying for transferring to Texas A&M (TAMU), probably for ECEN major. I had a great time in BUF with my cute friends, helpful and kind professor, but im not satisfied with the school resources, especially for Lab research and co-op network there, so I want to transfer to TAMU for better opportunities and resources.

My career goal is to work on Embedded Engineering. In detail, it could be embedded hardware, as listed below: working with circuit board (power, signal, digital board, microcontroller board), or working with wireless signal and communication. In particular, I have around 5 years experienced working on those things: microcontrollers (STM32 series, ESP32, Arduino), communication protocol (UART, RS485, SPI, I2C). I implemented them in my personal project and highschool robotics competition (not FTC/FRC). 

For the background above, I want to transfer to TAMU for better co-op and lab research opportunities. Specifically, I am looking for sth like industrial-related projects in TAMU, i means, diving into factory or industry, not just some common undergraduate project that everyone has to attend.

Other concern for the application: my budget is around 25-30k (preferably), my GPA from past years is 4.0 out of 4.0. And by the end of sophomore year, im gonna get enough credit (transferable) for moving.

I am F28 I now live in Munich officially since October to move in with my boyfriend (classic)

What follows is a mini dump of emotion, but basically what I want to ask is: is anyone down to meet to do something this upcoming Saturday? No particular idea but in the afternoon, depending on the people, we can decide I am up to anything really.



Longer version:

I am an expat, from France. Like most expats that lived in different cities before, I have a lot of friends scattered around the globes. I also have friends that are close (in Bavaria) and some really close in and outside Munich.

Why is it so hard to meet?

Everything has to be planned, with everyone, everywhere. I have basically have weekends planned until September except the following one. WTFFFF.

I have no one I can just casually ask to grab a coffee for an hour or so very spontaneously. If it‚Äôs not in the agenda, it‚Äôs not happening. 

Is it because I am close to turning 30? I honestly don‚Äôt think so‚Ä¶

I mean I can answer my own question, I feel like the problem is capacity.

I have more capacity now because now I am settled in Munich and I want to meet people close to me to nerd about music, nerd about films go to exhibit drink wine, paint‚Ä¶ Stuff. 

This winter, I was moving out and had so much on my plate, I didn't have time at all.

I have met so many lovely people, but no friendship will ever blossom, because they don‚Äôt have capacity. Or I didn't have capacity when they did. Arggggggh.

Now, that I back in the friendship game, I meet people that already have their friend group, they don‚Äôt need another person they have to make time for.

It‚Äôd phases of life I guess.

The goal is to have: Timing, location and capacity. Bam. Neat formula. TLC. Lol¬†

For expats, do you also feel the same? For Munich people, do you agree?

Dating was easier for me than making friends ahahah. 

I wish we had to go to high school again at 30 to make a new batch of forced friends.¬†

In the meantime, let me know if you have capacity to meet new people and do something sometimes?

Cheers!

PS: No one is at fault here, it‚Äôs just how life is and it is fine. Just needed to talk about it to someone else than my boyfriend ahah.",4,1749728268.0,munichsocialclub,0,0.83,False

I've since noticed my self confidence improve massively just by being forced to talk openly to others, albeit in a safe space. 

On several occasions, whilst waiting at the bus stop to go to therapy, I saw this cute girl (F2?). She glanced at me several times, but seemed shy. I smiled at her, debate to myself about starting a convo, but the bus would always arrive soon after she did. Thought nothing of it.

On another occasion, 1 week later, I'm walking through town and turn a corner - she's right there. We walk past each other, locking eyes briefly. Then both walk our separate ways.  
  
On the days I stop off in town to go to therapy, I start to frequent a local coffee shop. My heart skips a beat when I notice that she's sat in the corner, on her laptop. I notice her glance up at me when I order a coffee, we lock eyes. I look away, but when I look back she's still staring.

This would routinely happen, every time I went in to order a coffee. She would watch me quietly from the corner. I took this for a sign that she was somewhat interested. On one occasion, after I'd orderd my coffee, I noticed her go up to the bar straight after I was leaving. She began chatting to the bartender, catching my eye whilst she did so. I begin to think she could be asking her for my name, as I had exchanged a voucher card for a free drink (you get your name written on the voucher). 

One day, I'm in a particularly chatty mood. Going to coffee shops has been good as exposure therapy, but I feel a need to challenge myself by talking to strangers. So I greet the bartender serving me, and engage in polite conversation with the person next to me in the queue. Emboldened by these positive interactions, I decide to attempt to talk to this cute girl in the corner, who has noticed me by now.   
  
She's sitting next to a friend, both on laptops. I greet her friend (we've talked before several times) who is happy to engage in a short conversation.   
  
I then walk over to her, but she doesn't look up from her laptop screen. I should have thought more about what I was going to say. But before I have a chance to think, I blurt out ""Hey, I think i've seen you around by the bus stop I get on at? \*names bus stop\*?"" She doesn't move, continuing to stare at her screen. I feel a rising panic in me, feel blood rushing to my cheeks, my heart starts to race. She continues to ignore me. Then, an older man (M5?) comes over and tells me ""she can't talk now, she's working"". I'm really panicking now, and my fight or flight response is kicking in. I look up at him, back at her, back at her friend, back at her. ""Uhh.... Ok"" I say, and grab my coffee cup and walk quickly out, looking down at my phonescreen the entire time. I'm sure plenty of other people in there all saw the interaction. Awkward af.

It only occurred to me afterwards the implication of what I had said. I essentially publicly doxxed her, and what I chose to open the conversation with could even be seen as a little stalkerish, or generally creepy. But I stupidly thought it would be a good way to break the ice. My ears went hot, my brain clouded over, and I stammered like an idiot before i made a quick exit. Now, 1 day later, it's constantly running through my mind. I feel utterly humiliated. I'm not sure if I can bare to set foot in that coffee shop again. 

""TL:DR: See this cute girl at my bus stop several times, then as a regular in this coffee shop I start to go to. I finally work up the courage to say hi, but start convo by telling her I've seen her around by my bus stop. She ignores me, stares at laptop. Older man comes over and tells me she's working.

Context: A guy has been hyper vigelent of me, he is always staring and blushing. He comes up to me and then runs away. Others have commented on his attention.

His family visited from perth, they knew who i was before i knew who they were (easy to idnetify his twin brother tho). His brother basically interviewed me. We fought to answer ask questions and he laugjed with his head back like the guy i like does. He told me his twin was single and that he had been watching his brother and i together. Turns out we have the same world views, like country music and the country, surfing and have both travelled for work. This guy i like turns up at the end, hugs me when he finds out my Grandma just passed. I give him a little rub back. And tells me he will check up on me next week after the funeral. He hands me my cardigan likes its something prescious and blushes. His family who ride in his car let us go ahead by ourselves. 

The next week I'm numb with grief and this guy i like seeks me out, he asks me all these questions but i find it so hard to connect because I've just buried my Grandma and havent had more then 3 hrs sleep (havent been able to eat either :( ). 

He runs out on our convo to talk to someone then goes and sits in his car even though he said he would come back. I go to him because i dont want to wait. We talk a bit. He says he has buried someone he loves too, but doenst elaborate when i ask.
He asks after my days off. He says he will spend time ith me next saturday having coffee. He remembers where i live and will come to my suburb and we can get coffee there together. He then tells me on the one day his family was up from perth they went to all the places I reccomended to his siblings.
He tells me we are complimentary in our approach to work and he is glad about that.
He walks me to my car, telling me he will have to remember where i park and what my car looks like. and carries my stuff to the car and hugs me.

The next day he cancels the date. Saying he is busy and he liked talking to me but he has 'stuff to get through'. 
He ignores my question to reschedule just dodges it and says he is bad at texting.

Next week he sits behind me again. Watches me with my friends. Walks his friend out, sits in the car, then turns it off, comes right in, makes a beeline for me like a terminator. I catch him staring at me as he zooms towards me and he diverts. I call out and invite him into the group and he joins, chats, briefly mentions he hopes i have a nice few days off (remebered a small detail from last week). And then goes to leave. I walk him out and he offers to hold my stuff gain, and insisits. He tells me he had a relaxed week (which contridicts his busy week excuse for cancelling). He apologies for swearing to me with over exagerated body language (idm srsly if he knew what i did for work). Tells me he had a habit of being on his phone too much growing up so turns his phone off (which is fine tbh, im the same). And tells me he loves how pasionate i am about what i do. He seems really pleased abt my plans for the rest of the night and encourages me abt them. 
Since then hes been VERY active on messenger which contradicts his prior statement to me and still has nkt viewed my past message.

Why did he pull back? But then come back?

Was he scared off by my grief?


He said he knew what it was like to loose family, surely he knows i wasnt me that night we were alone after my Grandma's funeral and didn't attribute my grief to who I am compared to usual happy self he knew me, and enjoyed me as, before she passed..",1,1749727705.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

IMO, she wasted time going to 3 stores, posting 280+ grocery store items and claiming they were her ""favorite finds"" of the day.  Since she also claims she is frugal, I dare her to post the cost of all the items shown.  Which budget will that come out of Mrs. You GROW Girl?  Their dinner was pathetic and I will never believe Joe ""craved"" that meal.  

Speaking of Gym Bro Joe, yesterday was a wasted opportunity for him to discuss the Lose It! App, how he tracked his intake and got movement in sightseeing while his wife wasted hours in local grocery stores...

For the Gomez family pets? What a sh!tshow.  Kylea can't even be bothered to provide an update about the cats or show any proof Birdie's enjoying herself.  Best friend status?  Questionable.  Kylea proved she can be away from her ESA for *hours*. She wasn't crying in parking lots or wishing to go home to pet her coffee pot or be closer to Sweet Mama.  

Between her snippy attitude and brainwashing followers into believing her foodie finds are inspirational, motivational or healthy, this joke of a trip is not exciting or an adventure.

Hi! üëã
I've had this Monstera for a while now and I adore it! It's grown really fast, and I've let it spread out on my kitchen wall. Every morning when I drink my coffee, I just sit and admire it.
The problem is that for some time now, about three weeks, some of the leaves have started to turn yellow and dry out. I did a little research and found that this happens when it's overwatered, so I started watering it less frequently, about once a week or every week and a half. However, the problem hasn't gone away; the leaves are still drying.
I've included a photo at the end showing the general humidity I maintain where the Monstera is located. The pot is large; I repotted it half a year ago, but I haven't used any fertilizer. I'm not sure what the exact causes might be, so if you have any ideas, I really need your help, plant lovers! I don't want to risk losing it.

So pinansin nila ako binati ako and for me unexpected na tratuhin akong ganun kasi alam naman ng lahat ang karaniwang ginagawa na kapag tiwalag na huwag na kausapin, huwag na pansinin mga ganun.

So ito na next, kinausap nila ako nakiupo sila sa table ko sabi nila ""Parang matagal na mula nung natiwalag ka?"" tapos sagot ko ""Oo, mag 1 taon na rin"" tapos sagot ng isa ""Baka pwede ka na, gumawa ka na ng salaysay na para makabalik ka na."" sabi sa akin at ako naman tahimik lang na tumango habang iniinom ang caramel macchiato ko ganun lang 

Moments later nagulat ako tinanong ng isa niyang kasama ""Pre, Alam mo ba yang app na reddit?"" Tapos sagot ko naririnig ko lang pero wala ako nyan pa inosente na tanong ko sabi ko ""Yan ba bagong mobile games na uso ngayon?"" kung baga para kunwari hindi ko alam hehehehe. Tapos sumagot sila ""Ay hindi pre, isa siyang app na nandoon ang mga paninira sa iglesia bale kami nga nagulat kasi inisa isa phone namin kahit yung anak namin kaya ikaw ha kahit natiwalag ka na huwag na huwag ka maniniwala sa mga nababasa mo o baka mamaya kaya ayaw mo na bumalik dahil may Reddit ka na rin."" Ayun lang tahimik lang ako nakikinig pero pinasasalamat ko na kinausap pa rin nila ako.

So tama nga confirm nga ang mga post dito na nagchecheck na sila lalo sa mga binhi kung sino may Reddit apps so in my mind bahala sila pero salamat sa kanila na gusto pa nila na makabalik pa ako.. Di na ako nagtagal umalis na rin ako iniwasan ko na humaba usapan so maayos at magalang ang paalaman namin.

My thoughts Aftermath:

1. Naisip ko kahit tiwalag na lalo't nakikita ka pa nila sa vicinity ng lokal maaaring pagdudahan ka na may reddit lalo kung ayaw mo na magbalik loob and it takes a matter of time na after ang mga nasa loob baka pati gaya ko sa mga tulad ko na mapunta atensyon nila pagkatapos nila asikasuhin mga nasa loob

2. Thankful ako i express na gusto nila makabalik na ako pero in my mind sorry hindi na ganun ang pananampalataya ko(Thanks to this subreddit).

I wanted to do engineering but I've decided to pursue business. I was into science and technology because of Sci-Fi movies and other stuff. Anyways, I decided to pursue busines because I found something inside me that changed my focus.

A description of me, I'm a person who is good in socializing with people, i don‚Äôt have any interest in making girlfriends or bestfriends. I am very good in studies and grasping information. I'm a man of word and purpose. I want to become richer and powerful and enjoy life as a free man would. I believe in karma rather than pooja paath. I think we should work hard and the quote i follow is 
""Cut the trees Don't count the logs"".

I joined the BCA branch of my college as i did PCM in my 11-12, before joining the college I took a drop year for engineering college. Other reason was that I've been good in technical subjects rather than theoretical ones. My college is near my house and has 2 sections in BCA and we have combined classes 4/6 days in a week. There are only 3 teachers for the whole BCA branch and it's a very small college.

Anyways, When i joined the college,  I had it in my mind to make sure I have good terms with every one and be a friend with all students from different courses. I didn't make any plans of making girlfriend or girl bestfriends, i believe it's cringe to make girl bestfriends ( i could be wrong). 

So college starts, In the first semester, we had statistics in our syllabus and I'm the highest scoring student in my college in that subject. One random september afternoon, I'm sitting in the lab, we had a combined class of both sections. I have always been the teachers favorite and I have also done a lot of trouble that caused my parents and teachers to meet for a monthly coffee in 1st year.

Sitting in the lab, X( let's name her X here) came out of nowhere and said to me to help her solve these questions in stats, imagine the scenario ( i turned around and there stands a girl who wants me to answer her doubts) and clearly as an low scoring romantic I am, i said I'll tell you after class and didn't said anything, later on i texted her if she wanted any help and she said no i don't.

After this incident, she caught my attention, i knew about X as a girl in the other section but never wanted to be her friend or something. It's not like I don't make girls as my friend. I have many friends in college but i don't get close with them, fearing i might build a connection with them. 

So things kept the same pace, I used to sit in her friends group at canteen, I make everyone laugh, it's my nature and something that's my habit. I don't think i ever did anything that would make me any one closer in her friends group. After exams she used to ask me how my exams went and what i am doing in my free time and all. The on ly incident that occured in 1st sem that hinted me something was that one time someone hacked her whatsapp and she texted me to not reply if i receive any text from her number. Later on i told her to write a cyber complaint, she straight on told me can you show me in the college, we'll do it together. I as a hopeless romantic I am, straight on said ""no, you do it yourself"". I don't know why but i still did.
Things remain the same, nothing unusual in the first sem but it did changed in the 2nd sem drastically. There were girls in college that i was attracted to but i didn't consider doing anything on it as I have some goals that don't align with these things.A lot of things happened and it's more of a mess now in june 2025.

This is just the part 1 of the story, only including semester 1. Right now it's something more than friendship that is between me and her. I have planned on to visit her father's factory/industry, i don‚Äôt know if it can be called on as a date or something.

Florence Frequently Asked Questions

Hello lovely people of Reddit!

For the past few years of my Reddit life, I have seen that many questions regarding aspects of Florence get repeated periodically in this sub (and in a couple others), so I‚Äôve decided to try and make a series of FFAQs [Florence Frequently Asked Questions] posts, hoping to help anyone who might be searching for useful information on our beautiful city. This post is about [food](https://www.tasteatlas.com/best-dishes-in-florence), hopefully if it is appreciated I will be doing more in the near future.

I hope you will find it useful!

__________________________   
  
_You have just spent the day trekking around the city (I bet you haven‚Äôt walked this much in a long time!), admiring the beauty of Florence and immersing yourself in the magical vibe and incredible atmosphere of the city, and now you are hungry and can‚Äôt wait to sit down (or stand up) and enjoy some delicious local food.._  
  
_But wait! **What** is the local food that is served in Florence?  **Where** can you go to find it? And **how** is it eaten?_  
  
These are the questions that I will be trying to answer in this post.
  
**HOW**  
The classic Italian (and thus also Florentine) menu is usually divided in:  

- Antipasto: (literally ‚Äúbefore the meal‚Äù) it‚Äôs what in English is usually called a starter. Usually a small plate, not too complicated, eatable in a few bites, and that the restaurant can get ready quickly and give you will they prepare the main dishes. You can sometimes accompany it with a glass of white wine (usually Prosecco)
- Primo: (literally ‚Äúthe first‚Äù) it‚Äôs the main course. In Florence (and in all of Italy) it‚Äôs nearly always a pasta dish. Sometimes listed as primo you can also find a risotto or a soup.  
- Secondo: (literally ‚Äúthe second‚Äù) it‚Äôs the second course, served on a flat plate, usually consisting in cooked meat or fish (or vegetarian/vegan alternatives if the restaurant has them).   
- Contorno: (literally ‚Äúoutline‚Äù/‚Äúcontour‚Äù) it‚Äôs a side dish. It‚Äôs usually cooked vegetables/legumes/potatoes. Sometimes it will be served on the same plate as the Secondo, but most of the time it will come on a small side plate.  
- Dolce: (literally ‚Äúsweet‚Äù/‚Äúcake‚Äù) it‚Äôs dessert. Many restaurants will have it listed on a separate menu which you will have to ask the waiter to bring you.  
- Caff√® e Amaro: coffee and bitter.  
Both are usually served only at the end of the meal.  



Other useful info:  
- it is rare that people will go through a full course meal ordering all of what I‚Äôve listed above. It is much more common to have an antipasto (sometimes shared) and a primo OR a secondo.  
- when you want the bill (‚Äúil conto‚Äù) you will have to ask a waiter for it. Same goes for anything you may need during the meal.  You will not be disturbed or pressured by waiters during your meal.   
- it is not customary to tip unless you have had an exceptional service. You can do if you want, but don‚Äôt feel pressured into doing so.  
- you will be paying a ‚Äúcoperto‚Äù fee, which covers the table service (plates, cutlery, bread etc). It‚Äôs usually a couple euros (2-4) per person. It is absolutely normal.
- you can order a ‚Äúvino della casa‚Äù in most restaurants, which will bring you a jug with some basic (but usually) good house wine without having to buy an expensive bottle.  
- you won‚Äôt be served tap water (unless you ask for it directly). You will be given a 3‚Ç¨ glass water bottle. 

  
**WHERE**    

No, I won‚Äôt be telling you the names of specific restaurants: that would be impossible, since there are more than two thousand restaurants in the city (2233 according to tripadvisor at the time I‚Äôm writing this post), and there are continuously new openings (and closings).  
Also, listing names would be wrong because for sure I would be biased by personal experiences and preferences, and I could easily be accused of having been bribed for free pubblicity, so no, I will not be naming specific restaurants.  
 
What I will do, though, is give you a few tips for you to choose wisely.    
First of all, you should know that there are various types of restaurants, and you can usually categorise them directly from the name:  
  
- RISTORANTE:  this is the basic type of restaurant. You will probably find a bit of everything, from starters to mains to second courses. It has a bit of a formal feel.
  
- TRATTORIA:  this is what you need to look for for an authentic local food experience. A trattoria is usually a small welcoming and familiar restaurant, not at all formal, where you will experience the best traditional food, where every dish will probably have its own story. Often a trattoria is family run and during the meal you will be chatted to in a friendly manner by the waiters or owners. It‚Äôs all about conviviality and good food. 
  
- OSTERIA:  in the past it used to be a place that offerted hospitality, both regarding food, wine and also accomodation. In present times, it tends to be quite similar to a trattoria, with a slight sharper focus on the wine selection. 
  
- PIZZERIA:  not much explanation needed. If you go to a pizzeria you will be having pizza. Usually one per person (it‚Äôs rare that two people share a single pizza, unless they are sharing also another dish). Some pizzerie will offer also a limited selection of mains, but why would you want to have those if you chose a pizzeria?
  
- ENOTECA:  once it was a place where you went to buy wine. Over time it started offering wine tastings, and now it also offers a limited selection of food. The focus is mainly on wine though. 
  
- BAR: it has nothing to do with the English meaning. A bar in Italy (and Florence) is a multipurpose food and drinks place. A bar is where you can go for breakfast, a bar is where you stop for a coffee or a fruit juice, a bar is where you go to have a quick sandwich for lunch, a bar is where you go to eat a quick dish of pasta during your work lunch break, a bar is where you meet your friends to have an aperitivo, a bar is where pensioners meet and spend the day playing cards and drinking beer. The only thing you wouldn‚Äôt choose a bar for is a formal meal.
  
**WHAT**   
 Typical Florentine (and Tuscan) dishes originate from a poor, countryside style tradition, so they tend to focus more on quantity and substance instead of appearance and elegance. They rely on the quality of fresh, quality ingredients. Here is a list of some of the main Florentine dishes, with a quick explanation of each:      

- RIBOLLITA:  the name literally means ‚Äúre-boiled, boiled again‚Äù and in fact that‚Äôs how it was born. In old times people used to make a big quantities of soup on Fridays, with all sorts of simple vegetables, which would then be boiled again, and again and again together with stale bread, and eaten during the following days of the week.
Thanks to the use of bread, it has less the consistency of soup and more the sort of consistency of porridge. It‚Äôs main ingredients are cannellini beans, black Tuscan cabbage (cavolo nero), leftover bread and inexpensive vegetables (like carrots, celery, potato, onion, etc). Once served it is usually completed by adding some olive oil.
It‚Äôs served hot, so it‚Äôs usually considered more of a winter dish, but I think it‚Äôs delicious all year round.  

- PAPPA AL POMODORO: another Florentine recipe that ‚Äúrecycles‚Äù old stale bread to create a delicious plate. In English it could be described as ‚Äútomato mush‚Äù, it is a thick bread soup prepared with fresh tomatoes, obviously bread, olive oil, garlic, basil and sometimes other left over ingredients. Simple ingredients that create a delicious plate. 
  
*A small colorful note on bread: Bread in Florence, unlike bread in the rest of Italy, is made without salt (it‚Äôs, as we would say in Florence, ‚Äúsciocco‚Äù). The reason for this, tradition says, is because during the 12th century Pisa blocked all salt exports towards Florence and/or started putting huge tariffs (does that remind you of anyone today?) on salt being exported to Florence, city with which Pisa has been at war with for many times and many years. 
Florentines, instead of paying the high prices for the tariffs, decided to make do without salt and created an equally good bread which still today is eaten in the city (and most of Tuscany). Nowadays if you want a more salty type of bread, you can have the delicious Schiacciata all‚ÄôOlio (similar to the more famous genovese Focaccia, but slightly crunchier).*

- PAPPARDELLE AL CINGHIALE:  this is not a specifically Florentine recipe, since it originates from the southern part of Tuscany (Maremma), but has become widely eaten also in Florence. 
Pappardelle are a type of fresh long egg pasta, quite similar to tagliatelle but a bit wider. They go well with meat sauces, from game to duck to rabbit.  Pappardelle al cinghiale are pappardelle with wild boar sauce. The sauce is made by marinating big chunks of wild boar for 24 hours, then cooking them in Chianti wine, sage, rosemary, juniper berries, onion, carrot and peeled tomatoes to create the sauce. 

- PAPPARDELLE AL RAG√ö DI LEPRE: same pasta as described above, this time with hare sauce.    
  
- PAPPARDELLE SULLA NANA (PAPPARDELLE ALL‚ÄôANATRA): same pasta as described above, this time with duck sauce.

- PANZANELLA: you will only find this dish during spring/summer season, since it‚Äôs mainly served cold. 
It is, yet again, another plate that originates from creative ways to use up old/stale bread together with cheap ingredients. 
It is in fact a chopped salad of soaked stale bread, onions, tomatoes, cucumber, olive oil, salt, pepper and vinegar. This is the basic version, but sometimes you can find local variations which will add one or two extra ingredients, like for example on the coast (and on Elba island) they also add tuna and anchovies. It‚Äôs easy to make and a very refreshing lunch during hot summer days. (It‚Äôs not something you would tipically have for dinner).

- BISTECCA ALLA FIORENTINA:  Not much needs to be added. It‚Äôs the world famous Florentine T-Bone steak. Just remember that the traditional degree of doneness is ‚Äúrare‚Äù, or as we say in Florence ‚Äúal sangue‚Äù (literally ‚Äúbloody‚Äù). If you ask for anything from medium to well cooked you will receive glaring stares by anyone who hears you and you will be making enemies. It is considered nearly offensive to overcook such a delicacy. 

- ZUPPA TOSCANA:  a more traditional soup (as in more ‚Äúliquid‚Äù) that uses some of the usual cheap, fresh, quality ingredients as seen before for Ribollita. It usually includes: Kale (black cabbage), potatoes, peeled tomatoes, carrots, celery, garlic, onion, beans (borlotti or cannellini) and can SOMETIMES have guanciale/pancetta [so for vegetarians, always ask to be sure that it doesn‚Äôt]. 

- CARABACCIA:  another soup! This time made entirely of onions. Yes, exactly, onion soup, often served with some toasted bread and a few slices of hard cheese (pecorino toscano). 
This has quite a lot of history since it dates back to the 16th century. It is said that Leonardo da Vinci used to love it, thanks to its great sweet&sour taste and its vegetarian nature. It is also said that it was the Medici family (Caterina de Medici) who loved it and exported it to France with her when she became part of the French royal family. So the world famous French ‚Äúsoupe aux oignons‚Äù actually originated in Florence! The more you know. 

- TRIPPA ALLA FIORENTINA: Florentine style tripe. Pre-cooked strips of tripe, simmered in a tomato sauce, enriched with a soffritto di verdure (vegetable mix), and served in a bowl topped with grated parmigiano reggiano. Simple, yet tasty. 
 
- (PANINO CON IL) LAMPREDOTTO: Florence‚Äôs signature street food. Be warned, you have to be brave to try it, but once you do you will either love it or hate it. It‚Äôs basically the fourth stomach of a cow, cooked like tripe and served in a sandwich, usually topped with a delicious green sauce (salsa verde). 
It‚Äôs really popular as a quick sandwich meal to have on the go, so much that scattered around the city you can find special food vans called ‚Äúlampredottai‚Äù who just serve this.  
It‚Äôs not the type of food that you will find in restaurants. Also you won‚Äôt find Lampredotto anywhere outside of Tuscany, and probably nowhere outside Florence too.

- FAGIOLI ALL‚ÄôUCCELLETTO: Stewed beans in a tasty tomato sauce. Again, simple ingredients (cannellini beans, tomatoes, olive oil, sage, salt and pepper). The name literally means ‚Äúlittle bird beans‚Äù and apparently comes from the fact that the ingredients used to cook the beans with are the same ones that were used when cooking roast birds. 
Traditionally it‚Äôs a vegetarian/Vegan dish, but since they are VERY OFTEN eaten combined with sausage, it is not unusual, in some menus, to find them served already with chopped bits of sausage mixed in. If you are vegan/vegetarian, do be sure to ask the waiter if they contain sausage (salsiccia). 

- CROSTINI DI FEGATINI (CROSTINI TOSCANI): only served as an antipasto (starter) in restaurants, trattorie and sometimes in pizzerie. A ‚Äúcrostino‚Äù is an oven toasted slice of bread, crunchy, which is topped with sauces, vegetables, or cheese.   
Crostini ai fegatini are crostini with a black or brown sauce called ‚Äúfegatini‚Äù made with chicken liver combined with simple vegetables. 

- ZUCCOTTO:  a semi frozen dessert, made with alchermes, cake and ice cream. The name (literally translating to ‚Äúlittle pumpkin‚Äù) comes from the container that it is baked in, which vaguely resembles a small pumpkin. Some say that the shape takes inspiration from the Dome of the Duomo, others say that it comes from the shape of a cardinal‚Äôs hat (zucchetto). The traditional recipe has evolved a lot during the centuries, and today‚Äôs version is usually made with an external layer of sponge cake, dipped in alchermes, and a filling of ricotta cheese, candied orange and chocolate. Some places may vary the ingredients slightly.  

- CANTUCCI E VIN SANTO:  buiscuits and wine. Nothing complicated. That said, it‚Äôs a great way to finish a meal. You are given a small glass of ‚Äúholy wine‚Äù (a sweet tasting, white grape, amber coloured wine) on a plate with 5-6 ‚Äúcantucci (or cantuccini‚Äù, traditional dry and crunchy, twice baked, almond hard biscuits, that you are supposed to eat after dipping them into the wine. 
(Classic cantucci have almonds in them, but you can commonly find -maybe not in restaurants but in shops- alternative versions with chocolate chips or with apricot jam bits).  
  
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
This is the end of my list. I am aware that it cannot surely be complete and I‚Äôm quite sure that someone will probably point out other typical dishes that I have missed out.. which I will be absolutely happy to add! So yes, please add any reccomendations or signal any possible mistakes if you find any, all constructive criticism is highly appreciated.  
 
A final note:  
This post focuses on Florentine (and Tuscan) dishes, which you will find served in most restaurants in the city and region. Does this mean that menus will not have anything else? Absolutely not! You will without doubt find many other great dishes, that come from other regions local cuisine and that have become so popular to become nearly a ‚Äúcommodity‚Äù (think of pizza: it once was exclusive to Naples, and now you can find pizzerie all over Italy and the world).  

So yes, you are absolutely welcome to have linguine al pesto, to have tonnarelli cacio e pepe, to have baccal√† mantecato, to have melanzane alla parmigiana, etc.. and I‚Äôm sure they will be good. Just keep in mind that, while probably good everywhere, statistically these plates will be much better/excellent if eaten in the region in which they originate. 

What else to say? Ah yes, BUON APPETITO!

As the title suggests im in need of some fun espresso based ideas. Cafe just has the basics, want to try rolling out a fun ‚Äòdrink of the month‚Äô idea. It‚Äôs a very basic cafe

For ingredients we have the following:
Milk + alternatives (oat soy almond)
Flavoured syrup (vanilla, caramel, hazelnut)
Black loose leaf tea
Loose leaf chai tea 
Matcha powder 
Choc powder (33% cocoa so not the hot chocolate sweet stuff)
Sugar, honey, etc
Peanut butter (maybe there‚Äôs a fun drink w it? Haha)


Depending on item, can order in different items. Had coconut milk (bad one) for awhile but would get one coffee out of carton before it went bad. Not very popular

We have a shaker as well, I tried a frappe sort of style the other day but couldn‚Äôt get it to work 

I have some ideas but want to look into other varieties and ideas? Thanks :)

And it's not like there's a real difference in taste‚ÄîI did a blind test with friends once, and guess what? I couldn't even tell which was which. But still, my heart beats for ""my"" brand.

I wonder if there's some nostalgia thing going on here. Maybe it's linked to the first time I tried that coffee during a super chill vacation, and now drinking it kinda takes me back to that vibe. Or could it be some sort of identity thing where we want to align with brands that we think reflect 'us'? It makes me think about how ads subtly show happy, aspirational scenes to create a connection, almost like they're offering a lifestyle, not just a product.

Then there's the aversion part. It's strange how fiercely we can reject something just because it's ""not our brand."" Learned attitudes? Herd mentality, maybe? Perhaps it's the subtle messages over time that condition us to love or hate. I dunno, but next time I'm passing over a brand for ""my"" favorite, I'll try to catch myself and wonder... is this really about the coffee, or more about what's beneath the surface of choosing it? ü§î",5,1749727050.0,mindbeneath,0,1.0,False

Hello r/njpw

To cap off this series, I'll be going over each of the different factions, their accomplishments, and how they stand within New Japan.

This one will be a bit different from my other posts. I purposely avoid being subjective in what I post here in this subreddit. I prefer to stick to ""kayfabe"" and let the results and events speak for themselves (it helps that I mostly post on tournament results). However, this time, I'll be injecting my own personal opinions here, ranking who I think are the strongest and most successful factions of the past 6 months.

Because New Japan is so faction-centric, I think it's valuable to look at how each one has performed as a whole, seeing who's standing out and contributing the most, and who's lagging behind. I find it especially fascinating to look at the younger talent. There are a lot of young guys on the roster now taking up prominent roles within the company, so their performance says a lot about how they'll do in the future, as well as how the company is doing now.

So with all that being said, let's have a look at the factions of New Japan, starting with who I think has been the most successful one in the past 6 months...

\----------

# 1) Main Unit / Chaos

**Current Active Members in New Japan:**

* Hirooki Goto
* Hiroshi Tanahashi
* Shota Umino
* El Phantasmo
* Oleg Boltin
* YOSHI-HASHI
* Tomohiro Ishii
* Toru Yano
* El Desperado
* Master Wato
* YOH
* KUSHIDA
* Kevin Knight

**Achievements:**

* IWGP World Heavyweight Champion
   * **Hirooki Goto**
      * **124+ days, 6 defenses**
* IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion
   * **El Desperado**
      * **162+ days, 5 defenses**
* IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions
   * **Master Wato & YOH**
      * **47+ days, 0 defenses**
* NJPW World TV Championship
   * **El Phantasmo**
      * 91 days, 4 defenses
      * **47+ days, 1 defense**
* STRONG Openweight Champion
   * **Tomohiro Ishii**
      * **65+ days, 1 defense**
* New Japan Cup
   * Shota Umino
      * Finalist
* Best of the Super Juniors
   * YOH
      * Finalist

Hiroshi Tanahashi had a vow to make Main Unit a strong faction in the landscape of New Japan, and boy has it become that, as they are by far the #1 faction in New Japan for the first half of this year, especially after formally absorbing CHAOS into their ranks.

I initially had these two split up, but it was getting difficult to separate their achievements this year. In the end, it made the most sense to put them together. Honestly, they'd probably be #1 and #2 anyway for a multitude of reasons. They have two of the most dominant champions in the company at the moment, with Hirooki Goto as the World champion and El Desperado as the Junior champion. El Phantasmo has also had the TV title for a majority of this season, and they also have a hold of a couple of other titles as well. They've also been performing well in tournaments, as Umino and YOH made it to the finals of the New Japan Cup and BOSJ, respectively. It's hard to deny their dominance.

**Younger Talent Highlight:**

* Shota Umino (28)
* Master Wato (28)
* Kevin Knight (28)
* Oleg Boltin (32)

Main Unit has a few wrestlers in their 20's and early 30's, though their achievements this year have been mixed.

The most successful out of all of them might be Master Wato, who is the only current champion among them, being one half of the IWGP Jr Tag Champions. He was also a strong contender in A Block of the BOSJ, though he ultimately didn't make the finals. He does have a significant match on Dominion, defending his tag titles against House of Torture

Shota Umino has had a very mixed season. His peak so far has been making it to the finals of the New Japan Cup, but it's been mostly downs for him. He's had several high-profile loses, including two failed World title challenges and two major singles losses to Great-O-Khan and Shingo Takagi. He also has nothing going on going into Dominion, so his rebuilding phase needs to step up the pace.

Oleg Boltin is still in the rising portion of his career. He lost the NEVER 6-man tag titles earlier this year, and has (unsuccessfully) challenged Konosuke Takeshita for the NEVER title. He had a nice showing in the New Japan Cup, but didn't place very high. He'll be going after Takeshita again at Dominion, so we'll see if he can get his first singles title.

Kevin Knight hasn't been very active in New Japan. He had a STRONG tag title challenge in the US, and showed up for BOSJ, but outside of that, he hasn't done much since losing the jr tag titles at WK. He's been mostly active in AEW at the moment. It remains to be seen if that'll be his permanent home in the future, but it seems to be trending that way

# 2) TMDK

**Active Members in New Japan:**

* Zack Sabre Jr.
* Ryohei Oiwa
* Hartley Jackson
* Kosei Fujita
* Robbie Eagles

**Achievements:**

* IWGP World Heavyweight Champion
   * Zack Sabre Jr.
      * 120 Days, 4 defenses
* IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship
   * Ichiban Sweet Boys (Kosei Fujita & Robbie Eagles)
      * 115 days, 2 defenses
* New Japan Cup
   * Zack Sabre Jr.
      * Semi-Finalist
* Best of the Super Juniors
   * **Kosei Fujita**
      * **Winner**

Slipping down very slightly from Wrestle Kingdom is TMDK.

Coming out of Wrestle Kingdom, TMDK were set to continue their dominance from the second half of last year. Zack Sabre Jr. was the only male champion to defend their title over the two-day stretch and make it out with gold intact, and the duo of Robbie Eagles & Kosei Fujita came out with the junior tag titles, putting another ""youngest ever"" record under Fujita's belt. However, things very quickly began to tumble, as ZSJ lost his World title to Goto in February, and Ichiban Sweet Boys lost their tag titles just before BOSJ.

However, tournaments picked things back up for TMDK. ZSJ made it to the semi-finals of the New Japan Cup, and Fujita became the youngest ever winner of the BOSJ, marking two strong achievements for the faction, keeping them high up in the rankings. Zack has also been very successful even without the world title. the World title loss and the New Japan Cup loss were his only two singles losses of the season, and he's gotten many other impressive wins, including a non-tournament rematch win over David Finlay and singles wins over Tanahashi & Hechicero. He also had a rematch with Goto for the World title, and while he didn't win, he also didn't lose.

**Younger Talent Highlight:**

* Kosei Fujita (22)
* Ryohei Oiwa (26)

Kosei Fujita is the most successful talent in the roster relative to their age. He's broken several records already for being the youngest to achieve several accomplishments, and he's in line for another IWGP Junior Heavyweight title. Should he win that, he'll be cementing his legacy, building a strong future for himself and for TMDK.

The same, however, can't be said for Oiwa. Oiwa has been very eager since his return last year. He's been very active in going after titles, but he has not been very successful. The most recent title challenge was against Konosuke Takeshita for the NEVER title, marking his 4th attempt at a title. He didn't even make it very far in the New Japan Cup, only beating Chase Owens before losing to ZSJ in the second round. His only other singles accomplishment was a win over YOSHI-HASHI. He's currently marked for an undercard match at Dominion alongside ZSJ. Oiwa needs to put together a big win in his future before he really builds a reputation for failing in big moments.

# 3) Los Ingobernables de Japon (?)

**Current Active Members in New Japan:**

* Yota Tsuji
* Shingo Takagi
* Hiromu Takahashi

**Achievements:**

* IWGP Global Heavyweight Champion
   * **Yota Tsuji**
      * **162+ days, 4 defenses**
* IWGP Tag Team Champions
   * Tetsuya Naito & Hiromu Takahashi
      * 53 days, 0 defenses
* New Japan Cup
   * Shingo Takagi
      * Semi-Finalist

It was a bit of a tough choice deciding on the order of #3-5 in this list, but I've ultimately settled on the (former) members of Los Ingobernables de Japon at #3.

The main reason they're here at #3 is Yota Tsuji, who has had an impressive reign as IWGP Global Heavyweight champion. He's held it since Wrestle Kingdom (one of only 3 current champions to have done so), and he's had some great matches, including one of the best matches of the year vs Kidd.

The other members have had some meager achievements as well. Naito & Hiromu held the tag titles for a cup of coffee, and Takagi had a good showing in the New Japan Cup, making it to the semi-finals, but the biggest achievement of the faction is Tsuji's Global title reign.

**Younger Talent Highlight:**

* Yota Tsuji (31)

What else can I say about Yota Tsuji? I've glazed him enough in the main body of this section. He's been the most impressive and complete wrestler of his class, and looks to continue to do so going into the rest of 2025.

# 4) Bullet Club War Dogs

**Current Active Members in New Japan:**

* David Finlay
* Gabe Kidd
* Drilla Moloney
* Chase Owens
* Taiji Ishimori
* Clark Connors
* Robbie X
* Gedo

**Achievements:**

* STRONG Openweight Champion
   * Gabe Kidd
      * 335 days, 6 defenses
* New Japan Cup
   * **David Finlay**
      * **Winner**
   * Drilla Moloney
      * Quarter-Finalist

Next down are the War Dogs.

Unfortunately for the War Dogs, they have not accumulated a lot of wins this year, and that's mainly because they've been very focused on their beef with House of Torture. However, now that they've finally kicked the House out of Bullet Club, hopefully they can refocus on ""bringing gold"" instead of ""bringing bodies""

That's not to say they haven't achieved anything. Finlay's win of the New Japan Cup has kept the War Dogs from slipping further, even if it didn't lead to a World title win. Also, their Dog Pound Cage Match win over House of Torture was a huge win for the team, so that counts for something.

**Younger Talent Highlight:**

* Gabe Kidd (28)
* Drilla Moloney (28)
* Robbie X (30)
* Clark Connors (31)
* David Finlay (32)

On average, War Dogs is one of the youngest factions in New Japan today. While most of them haven't been as accomplished as some of the other young talent, there's a lot of potential for this group.

First off, Gabe Kidd, who is the most promising member of the group. He's been involved in two of the best matches of the year, against Kenny Omega at Wrestle Dynasty, and against Yota Tsuji at New Beginning. However, he lost both matches. Also, while he held the STRONG title a decent way into this year, he hasn't had a win in his defenses, drawing Ishii at Battle in the Valley, and losing to Ishii in their rematch at Windy City Riot. All in all, he's had great showings, but very little to show for it. He'll need something concrete to really cement his place on the roster.

Next is Drilla Moloney, who's made his debut in the heavyweight division this year, he's had some success, making the quarter-finals of the New Japan Cup, but no much else yet. We'll see what the future has in store for the drilla.

Robbie X is the newest member of the War Dogs. He hasn't really done much, but he's had a tag title challenge and a solid performance in the BOSJ.

Clark Connors has been holding it down in the junior division for the War Dogs. He had his first ever IWGP Junior title match this year, though he didn't win it. He's been  in New Japan now for a few years now, and while he's been a solid player, he hasn't quite broken through to the top yet.

Lastly, we have David Finlay, the leader of the War Dogs. He's already accomplished quite a bit in his relatively young career, and with many years still to come, he still has a lot of potential. Only time will tell what Finlay's ceiling is.

# 5) United Empire

**Current Active Members in New Japan:**

* Callum Newman
* Great-O-Khan
* Francesco Akira
* TJP
* Templario
* Jakob Austin Young

**Achievements:**

* IWGP Tag Team Champions
   * Callum Newman & Jeff Cobb
      * 9 days, 0 defenses
   * **Callum Newman & Great-O-Khan**
      * **50+ days, 0 defenses**
* NJPW World TV Champion
   * Great-O-Khan
      * 24 days, 0 defenses
* STRONG Openweight Tag Team Champions
   * **TJP & Templario**
      * **37+ days, 0 defenses**
* New Japan Cup
   * Jeff Cobb
      * Quarter-Finalist

Next down is the United Empire, who have been struggling in New Japan the last few years, seeing the departure of many significant names from the group.

Now, on paper, the United Empire have actually achieved quite a bit her in New Japan this year. My problem with them is that they've been very shallow. Four title reigns, but with 0 defenses so far, there hasn't been a lot of meat on the bones. Still, the future is promising. Callum Newman is still very new in his role as United Empire's leader, but at 22 years of age, he has a lot of time to grow into it.

**Younger Talent Highlight:**

* Callum Newman (22)
* Francesco Akira (25)
* HENARE (32)
* Jakob Austin Young (32)

The actual youngest faction in New Japan is undoubtedly United Empire, with Newman and Akira bringing down their average age significantly (especially if you exclude TJP & Templario).

Let's start with Callum Newman. He's had a pretty good 2025. Two tag title reigns, even if one ended by being vacated, and his first ever IWGP World Heavyweight tile challenge have made this year very eventful. He's been sort of awkwardly thrust into this leadership role, and while his skills in ring are undeniable, his leadership skills have been yet unproven. We'll see if he has what it takes to revive the Empire.

For Francesco Akira, his climb up the ranks of the junior division have been slow, but steady. Like Newman, he had his first Junior title challenge this year, in an impressive but unsuccessful effort. He did well in the BOSJ, but his temper may have cost him a BOSJ win, as he would've made the finals had he not been DQ'd in his match against Connors. He still has a lot of growing to do, but his future is promising.

On the precipice of what I'd call ""young talent"" are Henare & Jakob Austin Young. Now, Neither of these two have done much at all this year, for different reasons. Henare is out with injury, while Jakob has just not had much to do, just being a support player for the Empire.

# 6) House of Torture

**Current Active Members in New Japan:**

* EVIL
* SANADA
* Ren Narita
* Yujiro Takahashi
* SHO
* Yoshinobu Kanemaru
* Dick Togo

**Achievements:**

* NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Champions
   * **Ren Narita, SHO, Yoshinobu Kanemaru**
      * **136+ days, 1 defense**

Narrowly avoiding the bottom of the tier list is House of Torture, who's only claim to fame so far this year is a NEVER 6-Man title reign with scant few defenses (or should I say defense?). Still, it's a hair above what last place has done.

**Younger Talent Highlight:**

* Ren Narita (27)

The youngest member of House of Torture is Ren Narita, one of the now seldom mentioned Reiwa Three Musketeers. The youngest of the three, Narita has not been doing much, mostly just taking part in House of Torture shenanigans. He is part of the NEVER 6-Man championship team, though, so he does have some gold.

Narita has a lot of upside, but his antics now may be holding him back from his true potential, but maybe this is his unique path to glory. Who knows what's going on in his head.

# 7) Just 4 Guys

**Current Active Members in New Japan:**

* Yuya Uemura
* Taichi
* TAKA Michinoku

**Achievements:**

* New Japan Cup
   * Yuya Uemura
      * Quarter-Finalist
   * Taichi
      * Quarter-Finalist

Just 4 Guys just aren't having a good year. The injury to Douki and the loss of the Junior Heavyweight title have hurt the group significantly. When two quarter-final placements are your best achievements, you know you're in trouble.

That's not for a lack of trying though. I'll get more into it in a bit, but Uemura has been working his ass off to try to uplift the team. It's just not seeing any results. Hopefully, this alliance with Main Unit will produce some results for them, but until something big happens, they're not liable to move up any time soon.

**Younger Talent Highlight:**

* Yuya Uemura (30)

Uemura has been putting the work in this year. Quarter Finals in the New Japan Cup, a singles win over former World champion Sanada, and a Global title challenge against his perennial rival Yota Tsuji have been significant steps forward for Uemura. His trajectory is up, but he's not currently very high up yet. He still needs some doing to break into the main event scene.

Borison‚Äôs *First-Time Caller* and the emotional depth and charm of Abby Jimenez‚Äôs *Part of Your World*, *PIECES OF US*, complete at 86,000 words, is a contemporary romance built on chemistry, conversation, and the courage to rebuild.

Olive‚Äôs life is splintering, much like the reclaimed wood she pieces together to unwind after long days at a job that hasn‚Äôt inspired her in years. Her long-term boyfriend left her for a showmance and a lease that no longer includes her. Her aura-cleansing boss is only getting messier, and she‚Äôs stuck as an assistant at a Los Angeles production company where everyone else seems effortlessly wealthy, weird, or both. At home, her parents treat her life in L.A. like a temporary detour, counting down the days until she comes back to Florida and ‚Äúsettles down.‚Äù

When she‚Äôs told to send a party invite to a man named Ezra Avelo, she expects another forgettable task. Instead, their inbox thread quickly becomes the one thing she looks forward to. Ezra, a skateboard-riding, van-dwelling free spirit, is all offbeat charm, and their emails shift from scheduling to late-night confessions, existential musings, and a connection that deepens with every exchange. Through their growing conversations, Olive begins to glimpse the weight Ezra carries from a traumatic past, and in turn, shares a version of herself her family has never fully accepted.

When they finally meet, the chemistry is instant, electric, and complicated. Reality hits hard: Olive can‚Äôt afford to stay in L.A., and moving back in with her parents is starting to look inevitable. In a last-ditch effort to hold on to what they have found, she proposes a casual fling. But Ezra draws a friends-only line, a boundary tested with every glance, every conversation, and every unspoken moment spent alongside his loyal dog as her departure looms closer.

Just when her path out of California seems inevitable, a new one emerges: a commission for her woodworking, an unexpected job offer, and Ezra trusting her with a part of his story few others know.

They have both lost pieces of themselves along the way. Now, Olive must decide whether to risk building something new when there is no guarantee it will hold.

1l9ju03,https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/1l9ju03/having_trouble_deciding_between_ipad_a16_and_mini/,Having Trouble Deciding Between iPad (A16) and Mini 7,"Pausing my usual Reddit bot-squashing activities to seek out some advice. iPads are on sale, and I kind of want to get a tablet again. I have an old 10.4‚Äù 2022 Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite that I used to use with my Windows laptop as a second screen, but it has mainly been collecting dust since I upgraded to my Mac Mini M4 last year.

I work part time and have been feeling a little cooped up at home lately, so I figured I‚Äôd dust my Samsung tablet off and start taking it out to my local coffee shop for writing notes and basic productivity (email, reading articles, that kind of thing). Unfortunately, the last few Samsung One UI updates have slowed it down to a crawl. Can‚Äôt even type a freaking email on it without the text lagging.

So one way or another, it‚Äôs time for an upgrade. With the sale on, it seems like a good time to go for an iPad given that I‚Äôm already pretty deep in the Apple ecosystem.

**Here‚Äôs what my typical use case would look like:**

* Second screen with Mac Mini via Sidecar (main monitor is 27‚Äù, so the iPad would be positioned beneath the monitor)
* Annotating PDFs
* Light mobile productivity (email, drafting blog posts, reading news)
* Occasional light mobile entertainment (watching videos, maybe light gaming while commuting on bus/train)
* Occasional use as a laptop replacement when travelling maybe once a year or once every 2-3 years

**Things I definitely don‚Äôt need:**

* Apple Intelligence
* Pencil Pro (any serious drawing is done on my Mac Mini with my Wacom tablet)
* An insanely powerful processor (I literally just need enough to be able to type on a bluetooth keyboard without lagging)

The form factor of the iPad Mini is really attractive from a portability perspective, especially when travelling by air (but again, that‚Äôs only something I do maybe once a year or once every 2-3 years). It looks like it would just be so much more appealing to pick up and carry around, since it would be so easy to hold one-handed. I feel like it would be a nice size for note taking as well, either by hand or by typing. And though I way prefer reading physical books, it might be nice to have an e-reader-sized screen again. I mean, I \*could\* use an 11‚Äù iPad in bed for reading books, but the Mini would be more comfortable for sure.

The Mini form factor would probably be kinda shit though for everything else. Second screen (primary use case), mobile productivity, occasional laptop replacement ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm guessing having two apps open side by side on the Mini isn‚Äôt as great as it would be on a larger iPad. I also worry that having a smaller screen that‚Äôs more appealing to pick up will increase my overall screen time (which is something I‚Äôve been trying very hard to reduce on my iPhone).

I dunno. Anyone with similar use cases want to chime in? Would I get frustrated using the Mini as a second screen for my Mac?

1l9jszp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l9jszp/aita_lost_my_friends/,AITA? lost my friends,"i (f20) and my 3 ex friends (f19/20) had such a huge falling out and i believe that they had all ganged up on me. this all happened back in september and i‚Äôm over it now mostly but i do think back to when we were still friends because i miss those times but not the people, just the feeling of friendship i guess. we were so close they were like my sisters (we‚Äôd been friends since i moved to this city when i was 15) but when i think back there were quite a few things that they said or did that weren‚Äôt very nice to me.

for context, im autistic and was recently diagnosed at 18 after 3 years of doing research and being on waiting lists. i feel like the friends didnt understand or take into account that im autistic, always calling me weird for things or making fun of me for things and i never understood why. theyd make fun of me for wanting to show and play them my songs id written or songs id learnt (im big into music and studying it at uni) so id get my guitar and id sing them because im always proud of myself when i learn or write a song. theyd always sit there looking amused and theyd take pictures of me where its an awful angle and theyd basically just make fun of me. thats just one example. 

the main story is that wendy, lilly, and sarah basically just suddenly dropped on me (after months of them talking about it behind my back) that they were mad at me for spending time with my partner. now, im not the person to ignore my friends when im in a relationship (i know theyd say otherwise because of the kind of people they are) but my partner is the only person ive ever know that has never made me feel like shit for anything. they‚Äôve never done anything to hurt or upset me, they‚Äôve helped me get through traumas of SA and of past relationships that were still affecting me. they‚Äôre wonderful and as of today we‚Äôve been together 1 year 4 months. at the time this took place it was 7 months. 

i still hung out with my friends as much as i could but wendy and lilly are in two different cities and i stayed in our home city for uni and so did sarah although we‚Äôre at different unis so we don‚Äôt see eachother. during summer, lilly pretty much stayed in her uni city and barely came back so we didn‚Äôt see her much, i was on holiday with my partner and their family, and mainly just in their home city but was in mine too for job interviews and to see my family. wendy was on holidays in different countries and so was sarah. everyone was everywhere basically. this all took place on a wednesday but it‚Äôs important to note that on the monday, me and my partner had just moved into a very tiny studio apartment together, and on the friday, all of us and some others (including my partner) had a big group plan to meet up at wetherspoons (spoons) for a catch up and to see eachother basically. so i‚Äôm down for friday, everyone was down for friday, they were concrete, solid plans that i was looking forward to. on the monday, wendy, lilly, wendy‚Äôs bf and her other friend were at spoons but i couldn‚Äôt make it when they asked me to join. later that evening though, they called me around 7 and sounded so so happy and excited when i said that we‚Äôd finished unpacking for the day and i could come down but only for a little bit. our flat freezer is tiny so my partners dad was dropping off a freezer for us and my partner has scoliosis and a few other disabilities so i didn‚Äôt want to leave them to deal with that on their own because their dad was dropping it off then going. i got to spoons around 7:30 and left at around 8. our flat area is very dangerous and i had to get some things from the shop on the way back and i didn‚Äôt want to be out too late and as it was early september, it was already getting dark. wendy seemed immediately pissed off at me as soon as i arrived, and barely spoke to me. she just side eyed me the whole night (even though the phonecall suggested she was happy) and lilly saw me and immediately started telling me all the drama that‚Äôs been happening with her without me even saying anything. i‚Äôm always happy to hear about things like that so i didn‚Äôt mind. after we‚Äôd spoke for a bit i left because everyone was off with me. at home i told my partner about it and they said to wait and see how friday was because they‚Äôd be there too if anything kicked off. 

we didn‚Äôt even get to friday. i was supposed to meet up with wendy on the wednesday before she went back to her uni city, but me and my partner were swamped with flat stuff and so i messaged her to ask if we could reschedule for the thursday instead and apologies for rescheduling so late (it was the tuesday night) she didn‚Äôt answer for almost the whole day and i asked her if she was mad at me and she said she was. i asked why and she just answered with ‚Äúi think i made it very clear to you in my message on snapchat‚Äù i was confused, we barely messaged on snapchat (i don‚Äôt have it anymore) and she‚Äôd never once mentioned being mad at me. it turns out that she was mad at me because her and sarah went to her home city despite originally planning it with me, and they never told me about it and i found out via instagram. i was upset about it and confronted wendy and that‚Äôs literally why she was mad at me.  apparently saying ‚Äúi was supposed to be there‚Äù invokes anger in people when you‚Äôre upset that they‚Äôve taken someone else and not even told you about any of it.  so that kicked off an argument. at first i was trying to be adult and respectful but she just kept spewing out bullshit, and then said that the others were upset too but she ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt speak on their behalf‚Äù so i messaged lilly and she told me that they‚Äôd all been upset at me for months because i‚Äôd barely seen them (keep in mind what i said about where everyone was most of summer) and that i spend too much time with my partner and shit like that so i had enough and just said that we‚Äôd just moved in together, they‚Äôre the only person i have that doesn‚Äôt treat me like shit and if you‚Äôve all been so upset at me for so long then why would you not say anything about it?? how am i supposed to know? i‚Äôm not a fuckign mind reader. and then i think i blocked lilly after sending that message. then i think sarah messaged me basically attacking me saying ‚Äúi know you didn‚Äôt just call me childish in that message to lilly‚Äù (i said that they should‚Äôve spoken to me like adults. which is true. this reads like something that would‚Äôve happened with 14 year olds but i‚Äôd just like to remind you that we were all 19 and going into second year of uni when this happened.) me and sarah had a bit of a go at eachother and at the same time i was getting messages from wendy. i just told her to basically never message me again because it wasn‚Äôt getting anywhere and i don‚Äôt want to be friends with people that treat me that way. her last message to me was something along the lines of ‚Äú(my name) im so disappointed in you. you‚Äôve been so important to me for so long and yet you‚Äôre refusing to see the other side and you‚Äôre acting like the victim. i hope you get the mental health help you need and end your stupid codependency with your boyfriend.‚Äù 

a few important things i‚Äôd like to mention: my preferred name (i am afab but it‚Äôs a strong strong preference) is a nickname of my actual name. there‚Äôs two nicknames it could be and i tried one and didn‚Äôt like it so i tried the other and it fits because i do not like my actual name. BOTH times i told my friends that i wanted to be called a different name, none of them respected it. one of them even said ‚Äúi‚Äôve known you so long as (actual name) so it‚Äôs weird to call you anything else so im just gonna keep calling you (actual name).‚Äù the only time any of them have called me my preferred name is wendy, and literally just in that one argument, like she was trying to make it more personal and hit harder. the other thing id like to mention is my partner uses he/they pronouns but STRONGLY prefers the more non binary terms which is why i refer to them almost completely non binary, their name isn‚Äôt their actual name either (not a deadname thing, just a strong preference). my friends always used he/him and referred to them as my boyfriend (as shown in that last message i typed out) pretty much the entire time. it always pissed me off because they knew these things and would hear me only rarely using he pronouns and always calling them my partner, not boyfriend. it seemed incredibly disrespectful to me and my partner.

the update to this situation is that wendy messaged me at the end of december (after i told her to never message me again and had them all blocked on social media (i have unblocked them now bc i just don‚Äôt care if they see my profile they can block me if they care that much) and hadn‚Äôt reached out to them) and she sent this long ass message about how awful she feels and she wants to talk about it all even if we don‚Äôt become friends again. and i said okay. we met in a coffee shop a few days later (just me and wendy) and i explained that i felt incredibly attacked by the three of them snd that im not codependent on my partner. i love them and i love doing things with them but i do things on my own, have my own hobbies, we visit our families seperately sometimes and are apart from eachother with no problems when we have to be. and i said that i was upset that no one told me anything about being upset or mad at me. she said that she felt strongly that i was in the wrong and that i was with my partner way too much and that she‚Äôd see pictures id post on my story or bereal of me or me and my partner and she‚Äôd immediately get jealous and angry and think that i hate them all and never wanna see them again. i was thinking (and still think) that it‚Äôs not my fault or responsibility that you immediately jumped to those conclusions after seeing a picture of me half asleep on bereal. be so serious. we talked about the possibility of becoming friends again since our talked seemed to go well, i just sat there and listened to her bullshit excuses and she probably didn‚Äôt take in anything i said. she said that the next day she was seeing lilly and sarah to go to lilly‚Äôs uni city for new years and that she‚Äôd talk to them about what i said and also about if she should be friends with me again which i think k is weird because she wouldn‚Äôt tell me what they were upset about or anything because she didn‚Äôt wanna speak for them yet she‚Äôs out here telling them all my business?? yeah okay sure. anyway as you can probably guess we are not friends because she was messaging me as they were all together on the train and saying that they don‚Äôt think i took accountability for anything and that im still acting like the victim. i said something along the lines of ‚Äúi don‚Äôt think j have anything to take accountability for, ive not done anything wrong you‚Äôre the ones that attacked me over something i didn‚Äôt even know about and it‚Äôs unfair to assume that i would know you‚Äôre upset especially if you‚Äôre acting like everything‚Äôs fine.‚Äù so long story short there was another little argument and sarah messaged me through wendy‚Äôs phone to say one thing about why she was upset (apparently at my birthday my partner said a comment about her uni course and i didn‚Äôt stick up for her but we were all drunk and no one else there remembers. also, my birthday is in may. MAY. AND SHE DIDNT THINK TO MENTION IT??) and wendy said that neither sarah or lilly want to reach out to me but if i ‚Äúeven cared at all‚Äù id message them. i made it very clear that i dont give a shit. my life has been better without them i couldn‚Äôt care less about why they‚Äôre upset at me. so basically it just ended.

AITA??

TLDR: after years of being made fun of and mistreated by them, i lost all my friends because they attacked me over something i didn‚Äôt know about that they‚Äôd been talking about for months behind my back, one of them tried to reconcile but spoke to the others and they decided i hadn‚Äôt taken accountability so we havent spoken since.

1l9jq7o,https://i.redd.it/a9nczzhgbh6f1.jpeg,Kendu HHI looks solid,"What‚Äôs HHI, and Why Does It Matter in Crypto?

HHI stands for Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. It‚Äôs a way to measure how concentrated the supply of a cryptocurrency is.

In crypto, low HHI is good. It means decentralization. It means power is spread out instead of controlled by a few.

On Crypto Twitter, you‚Äôll see lots of charts comparing token holder stats. But somehow, Kendu never makes the list. And yet, Kendu has an HHI score of 28.65. That‚Äôs extremely low. One of the best scores in the entire space.

This isn‚Äôt a new token riding a wave of hype either. Kendu has been around for over a year. It‚Äôs backed by a community that works hard and builds consistently.

What Makes Kendu Different?

Kendu is a permissionless brand. It‚Äôs a platform where the community builds real businesses and products.

There‚Äôs a shared utility between holders and builders. Builders create under the Kendu name. Holders support them. That cycle creates marketing, awareness, and value for everyone.

If you benefit from Kendu, the culture encourages you to give back. Not because you have to, but because you want to.

Kendu doesn‚Äôt just exist in crypto. It brings crypto into real life.

Here‚Äôs what the Kendu community has already built:
	‚Ä¢	KenduGames, an indie gaming studio with ex-Bioware and AAA talent
	‚Ä¢	Kendu Energy, an energy drink company experimenting with new flavors
	‚Ä¢	Kendu Coffee, a specialty roast with a loyal following
	‚Ä¢	Kendu Vendu, AI-powered vending machines launching soon
	‚Ä¢	KenduStreet, mural and street art projects led by a SHIB subreddit mod
	‚Ä¢	Kendu Organics, a clean body care brand
	‚Ä¢	Kendu Entertain, an Indian events company hosting nightclubs and sports gatherings
	‚Ä¢	Plus Kendu eSports, hot dogs, vapes, chocolate, vodka, jewelry, plush toys, merch and much more

Kendu Is Just Getting Started

Don‚Äôt be surprised when you see Kendu hit a multi-billion dollar market cap.
Don‚Äôt be surprised when it goes into the tens of billions either.

It‚Äôs on track to become a household name.

You‚Äôre reading this now. You‚Äôll remember this moment later.

Kendu is the impossible made possible.

And you are part of what makes it real.

1l9jnzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1l9jnzu/my_love_until_the_last_goodbye_novel_mary_stood/,"""My Love Until the Last Goodbye Novel""- Mary stood on the balcony of the room she had slept in for the past three years.","Mary stood on the balcony of the room she had slept in for the past three years. She didn't want to turn on the lights; the darkness of the night would hide the tears rolling down her cheeks.

'This is over! I can't go on like this. I can't take it anymore,' she thought as she stared straight ahead.

Suddenly, the light from a car snapped her out of her thoughts. Her beloved husband was coming home, and she knew exactly what would happen. Her husband, Maximus Palmer, was the president of the Palmer Group, one of the most important conglomerates in Valeria. Earlier that morning, Maximus had forgotten a folder full of documents. Knowing him, he would probably need them and would be in trouble if he didn't.

She had tried calling him several times to inform him about the documents. Still, when he didn't answer, she left the mansion with the mission to deliver them herself. She only informed Emma Rosewood, her housekeeper.

""Emma, Maximus isn't answering. Are you sure he had these documents in his hand this morning?"" she asked, her voice full of worry.

""Yes, ma'am! He was putting everything in his briefcase in the living room, but then he got a call, so I think he forgot to pack them. I assume he's going to need them.""

""Okay, okay! I'm leaving right now. Maybe I'll get there in time,"" Mary said.

""Drive safely, ma'am!"" Emma called out as she watched Mary rush out.

After speeding through the streets in her car, she finally arrived at Palmer Group's office. She had never set foot there in her three years of marriage, but this time, it was urgent.

She entered the lobby and saw no one. She knew there was an elevator that went straight to the president's office. Without knowing for sure but as if luck were on her side, she chose that one. After several floors, the bell dinged, announcing her arrival. Mary stepped out of the elevator, and luckily for her, the hallway was empty, and Maximus's secretary's desk was unoccupied too.

""Where could Matthew be? Where is everyone?"" she wondered out loud, though no one answered, of course.

She walked towards the large, elegantly carved wooden door. She entered without knocking, and what she saw left her speechless. Maximus had his pants down, thrusting in a way he never had with her. She could see the blonde woman with him; it was none other than Alexia Levett, his only female assistant. Mary dropped the folder, and Maximus, hearing the noise, turned around, stunned. He adjusted his shirt to hide his reaction, hastily pulling up his pants, while Alexia grabbed her blouse to cover her completely bared and sweaty body.

Mary's reaction was hardly surprising.

""So, it's her you've been cheating on me with all this time?"" She started cursing at him. ""You shameless man! I hate you! And you, I'm going to end you!"" Mary screamed as she lunged at Alexia.

She was almost upon the bared woman when a sharp pain hit her in the stomach. Maximus had just punched her, knocking her to her knees. Lately, these hysterical outbursts had become more common, and seeing her approach his lover with a murderous look, he had no choice but to hit her. Taking advantage of Mary being on the floor, Maximus called Matthew on his cell phone.

""Matthew, I need you to take Mary back to the mansion and keep her there!""

It didn't take Matthew long to arrive. Mary was still on the floor, clutching her stomach. Matthew helped her up, trying not to look at Alexia, who was only half-covered with a poorly buttoned blouse. He felt sorry for Mary. Catching her husband like that couldn't have been one of the most pleasant experiences.

""Mrs. Palmer, let's go home. You need to calm down,"" Matthew said, putting special emphasis on ""Palmer,"" knowing this might earn him a reprimand later. But in that moment, he put himself in her shoes.

""Matthew?""

""Yes, sir! Stay at the mansion and make sure she stays there,"" Maximus ordered, his voice cold and authoritative.

'Where could the poor woman go?' Matthew thought. She was alone in a foreign country, with a husband who wouldn't let her make friends with just anyone.

""Ma'am, let's go. I'll take you home.""

""No! I don't want to go home!""

""Please don't make things difficult, ma'am. You know how the boss gets when he loses his patience.""

""Matthew, I don't want to go home! Please, I don't want to go home! I want to go back to my country! I want my life back!""

Hearing that last sentence, Matthew felt uncomfortable. He remembered the circumstances that had brought Mary to Valentia. The reasons she left her country were serious, and going back wouldn't be easy. It would put her and her family at risk.

""I have no choice, ma'am. I have to take you back to the mansion.""

""Yes, Matthew, I know! I was just saying it, imagining I could be free and go back to my old life.""

""You know you can't, ma'am. It's too dangerous for your grandfather.""

""That's the only reason I'm still putting up with all this, and you know it. If it weren't for my grandfather, I would've left already, married or not.""

Matthew arrived at the Palmer mansion. He opened the passenger door and saw the shattered fragments of an abused, humiliated, and forgotten woman get out. He felt his heart clench, but there was nothing he could do. In matters like this, it was best not to get involved. Maximus was strict and didn't allow anyone to comment on his marriage. The only one who could say anything was Mrs. Catherine Palmer, Maximus's grandmother, but she wasn't around right now.

After staring at the moon and her surroundings for a long time, trying to find the strength for what lay ahead, Mary finally entered without turning on the light. She went into the bathroom and washed her face to wipe away the traces of tears she had shed. Her hands were trembling. She knew the storm that was coming.

""Emma?""

""Yes, sir?""

""Where is Mary?""

""In her room. Matthew asked me to keep an eye on her, to make sure she doesn't do anything silly. Is everything alright?""

""Yes, Emma. I don't need your services tonight, so please leave.""

""Okay, I was actually just about to head to my room.""

""No, I want you to leave me completely alone with Mary.""

""But, sir...""

""Get out!""

Emma couldn't resist any further. She had to leave, feeling a tightness in her chest. She didn't know why he was in such a bad mood, but tonight, Mr. Palmer's expression was darker and more frightening than usual.

""Mary!"" Maximus called out as he entered the room.

""Yes?"" she answered, walking out of the bathroom with little enthusiasm.

""I want an explanation for your behavior today at the office.""

""There's nothing to explain,"" Mary said curtly.

""Mary!"" Maximus snapped.

""Don't worry, I'll never set foot in your office again. If I find something I think you'll need, I'll call Matthew to come pick it up.""

""That's what I hope. You're completely forbidden from going to the office. In fact, I've ordered that you not be granted access.""

""I already told you not to worry. It won't happen again,"" Mary said, starting to walk toward her dressing room to change into her pajamas. ""Now, if you don't have anything else to say to me, could you please leave my room?""

Seeing Mary's indifference, Maximus couldn't argue any further. He clenched his fists in frustration. On his way here, he had rehearsed a long speech for his wife, expecting her to be filled with insults and complaints.

""Mary, you know very well that I don't love you. I married you because of my grandmother. The one I really love is Alexia. You and I are only together because of the long-standing friendship between your grandfather and mine.""

""I know. You don't have to remind me every time you do something that goes against our marriage,"" Mary replied as she entered her dressing room and shut the door.

Seeing the sadness in Mary's eyes, Maximus couldn't help but feel a lump in his throat, a dull ache beginning to form. He didn't know why, but it was better to get out of that room.

After leaving his wife's room, he headed to the master bedroom, took a shower, and decided to turn in early. As he slept, it was as if his mind played a cruel trick on him, reminding him of how he had met his wife.

Back then early in the morning, he had been exhausted, just wanting a glass of water. Instead, he found a girl in pajamas drinking milk, unable to say a word to him. Her large and expressive almond-colored eyes caught his attention immediately. Although he managed to feign indifference, his heart had been captivated by that gaze.

Chapter 0002

Mary was exhausted from all the crying. As she put on her pajamas, she saw a large bruise on her stomach, caused by the blow her husband had landed earlier that day. A tear rolled down her cheek, but she chose not to think about it anymore. This wasn't the first time it had happened, so seeing her skin marked up like this wasn't new. She reminded herself that all of this was for her grandfather, and she couldn't let him down.

When she finally managed to fall asleep, she drifted into a dark dream that suddenly filled with light. She began to see brief flashes of what her life would be like. They were short, but each one left a hollow feeling in her heart. Her life wouldn't change for the better. On the contrary, despite all her efforts, she would end up alone and without a family. Her grandfather would die in prison, and Maximus and Alexia would live happily after turning Mary's family over to the embassy. She would end up living on the streets, going hungry, unable to feed her baby.

""Ah!"" she screamed, waking up.

The sudden dream woke her at 5 am. In the dream, her little one had died of starvation and cold at 5 pm. No matter how much she had pleaded for help, no one had come to her aid‚Äîat least, that's what she could remember. She looked at her arms and wondered who that baby was, and how she ended up in such a terrible situation.

For a few minutes, she thought about it. The baby couldn't be Maximus's. He had never treated her as his wife, so never touched her. In fact, he had told her outright that he felt repulsed by her. He couldn't be the father.

""Oh, Mary, you're losing your mind, dreaming about things that will never happen. Most likely, you'll die old and forgotten in this big mansion,"" she told herself while she washed up.

By the time she left the bedroom, it was nearly 7:00 am. She headed to the kitchen. Today, she particularly craved some coffee like they made it back home, so she put a pot on and added a bit of cinnamon to boil. As she waited for the water to heat up, Emma walked in.

""Ma'am, are you alright? Yesterday, the master sent me away, and I couldn't stay with you.""

""Yes, Emma, everything's fine! Today I want to have breakfast like in my country. I made some coffee. Would you like to join me after Maximus leaves?""

""Yes, ma'am!"" Emma replied, though she was still a bit worried.

Mary smiled, sensing that Emma wasn't fully convinced by her response. The aroma of the coffee she had made filled the entire first floor of the house. She poured herself a cup and went out to the garden to sit at the table outside. She intended to just admire the garden and lose herself in her thoughts. Today, she particularly didn't feel like having breakfast with her husband, so she planned to wait outside until he finished eating and left‚Äîat least, that's what she imagined would happen.

Maximus had just entered through one of the house's entrances after going for a run. Last night's dream had left him a bit unsettled, so he decided to get up early to distract himself. When he arrived, he noticed the delicious aroma of coffee and something else. Before cleaning up, he headed to the kitchen and found Emma.

""It smells delicious, Emma! What coffee did you buy?""

""Oh, sir! It's the missus' coffee. She got up early and made it.""

""Mary is awake?""

""Yes, in fact, she's in the garden. She poured herself some coffee and told me she'd be drinking it outside,"" Emma said, pointing to the garden table.

Maximus couldn't help but look out and see his wife's small figure curled up in the garden chair. Her back was to the window, so Mary didn't see who was watching her.

""Well, I guess we'll be having breakfast in the garden today.""

""Would you like me to take your breakfast out there, then?""

""Yes, please!""

""Alright, sir!""

""I'll be down in a moment. I have a meeting at 9 am, so I can leave a little later today.""

""Very well, sir, I'll bring your breakfast.""

Without thinking any further about it, he went to take a shower and came out as the same businessman his wife knew all too well. Mary was listening to music, lost in the memory of the dream she'd had the previous night. Her thoughts were interrupted by a familiar scent of mint and citrus.

She opened her eyes, and there was Maximus, reading the news on his tablet and sipping from a coffee cup. That small gesture would have seemed wonderful just a few hours ago, but now everything was too messy. When she saw him, all she felt was the urge to cry, but she couldn't give him that satisfaction. So, she just closed her eyes again, turned up the music on her phone, and pretended no one else was there.

Maximus could only feel frustration at her attempt to ignore him, but he also understood it was to be expected. She hadn't caused a scene last night, but he knew she was upset. After all, he had used force to calm her down yet again.

""Sir, here's your coffee!""

""He already has coffee, Emma. He just stole mine. Could you give me that cup?""

Emma didn't know how to respond until Maximus signaled her to hand over the cup.

""I'll be back with your breakfasts.""

""Emma, I just want coffee for now,"" Mary said.

""Understood, ma'am.""

The calm with which Mary had spoken to her earlier was disrupted by her husband's appearance. So Emma limited her response to that and returned with a plate of fruit and some French toast for Maximus. Mary kept listening to music and drinking coffee, not saying a word to Maximus.

Growing increasingly desperate over her indifference, Maximum pulled a black bank card from his wallet, gestured at her, and said, ""I know what you saw yesterday wasn't right, but you also know I don't love you. You knew from the start, and you still accepted my grandmother's proposal. So let's keep things as they are."" He extended the card towards her.

""I don't need you to compensate me for the punch you gave me yesterday. Do you know what I want? Do you even know?"" Mary said, as a tear slipped out‚Äîthe same one she'd worked hard to hold back.

""What? Tell me!"" Maximus hoped her response would be something material he could provide, something to ease his conscience.

""I want a divorce!"" Mary blurted out what she never thought she'd say.

Maximus nearly choked on the sip of coffee he had just taken when he heard what his wife said.

""What did you just say? Are you feeling okay? You've fought so hard for this, and now you tell me you 'want a divorce.'""

""Maximus, it's clear you don't love me, and I'm tired. I'm seriously asking you to divorce me. We've been married almost three years, and this isn't working, nor will it ever work,"" Mary said as tears flowed from her eyes.

Emma watched the scene from the kitchen window, not knowing what the conversation was about but sensing it was something the master didn't like. She was ready to run out and support Mary if Maximus dared to lay a hand on her again.

""Have your assistant draft a divorce agreement, whatever you want, whatever suits you best. I'll sign it today, and if possible, we'll go to the civil registry today to finalize our divorce.""

""Do you think it's that easy? Just drafting and signing a piece of paper? No, Mary, if I do that, my grandmother will come after me, and you'll end up as usual, playing the victim.""

Mary was speechless. Was that not exactly what was happening in this relationship?

The day before, she had found him sleeping with Alexia in his office, and instead of offering an explanation, he had punched her hard in the stomach and then banned her from going to the company.

""I want the divorce! I don't care if I have to talk to your grandmother today. Draft the paper, and I'll sign it,"" Mary said as she stood up from the table to leave.

""Mary!"" Maximus shouted.

""I. already. told. you. I'll see your grandmother today, and by tonight, I expect the agreement ready to sign. If not, I'll draft it myself. But before the anniversary of your company, we need to be divorced.""

Maximus quickly stood up to catch up with Mary. No matter how fast she walked, her small strides couldn't match his long ones. He was furious, so he grabbed her arm and yanked her back. She almost fell, and Emma, seeing the scene, ran out to help.

However, when she arrived, she saw that Maximus, who seemed to have fire in his eyes just moments ago, was embracing Mary.

""You and I are not getting divorced! You need to get that through your head. I will never draft anything. This is your home; you are my wife, and I'm not going to let you go.""

Mary was confused. Wasn't divorce what he wanted so badly? Why was it such that she was asking for it, and he did not agree?

""Let me go! I want a divorce! I've already told you, you'll be free to do whatever you want, so I don't see why you should keep up appearances if everyone already knows.""

Seeing her determination, Maximus let go of her and stormed out of the house in a rage. He tried not to look back at his wife because he knew he wouldn't hold back and might even strangle her. This girl had the power to drive him out of his mind so easily that he decided to leave immediately.

""Sir, yesterday was my fault that Mrs. Palmer saw you in an awkward situation. I was handling some matters with the other assistants, and she came in unannounced. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding,"" Matthew said, trying to clarify what had happened the previous day.

""There's no need for your apology. What Mary saw yesterday has already sped things up,"" Maximus said in a serious tone, but without anger.

Mary stood in the garden, watching her husband leave. Tears flowed as if from a fountain. She had finally said what she never thought she would. She felt a sharp pain in her chest, struggled to breathe, and could only collapse onto the grass. Emma ran to help her up and escorted her back to her room.

""Ma'am, you need to rest. Maybe it's exhaustion. You've been through a lot lately. You need to try to calm down and rest. I can bring your breakfast to your room if you don't want to come out.""

""I have no appetite. I think the argument took it away. Could you let me sleep for a while?""

""Of course, ma'am! I'll be downstairs. Just send me a message, and I'll come to you right away.""

""Thank you, Emma,"" Mary said softly.

Chapter 0003

Mary lay down, trying to calm herself and find the right words to tell Catherine that divorce was the only viable option for her marriage. Suddenly, her phone buzzed with a new text message.

\[How did you like yesterday's scene?

You know, this isn't the first time. We do it once or twice a day; your husband is insatiable. Normally this only happens in couples who truly love each other. I suppose you wouldn't know, since your marriage is just a farce, and the only one happy with it is you.\]

The message was accompanied by a highly compromising photo of Alexia and Maximus. All the calm that Mary had managed to maintain shattered, and she began to cry desperately. He had never touched her like that. She wasn't a V-card, but he had never desired her the way he clearly desired Alexia in that picture.

Suddenly, she went into a frenzy, knocking over everything on her vanity. She smashed the mirror, sending shards of glass scattering across the floor. She picked up a piece and began cutting into her skin. She wanted to feel alive, and these cuts gave her a strange, pleasurable pain that made her feel better. She had discovered some time ago that cutting herself was a way to release her frustration, so she often had marks on her arms. Without realizing it, she cut a vein in her wrist, causing her to bleed out quickly.

Emma heard the noise and rushed to Mary's room. When she tried to enter, she found the door was locked from the inside.

""Ma'am? Ma'am? Are you alright? Please answer me!"" Emma called out, panic in her voice.

The housekeeper, getting no response, became frightened and began dialing Maximus's number.

""Please pick up, please‚Ä¶""

""Yes?""

""Sir, please come quickly! The missus has locked herself in her room and won't open the door. I heard a lot of noise inside, but she won't open or answer me.""

""Emma, I'm about to go into a meeting. It's probably just another one of her tantrums to make me come back. Go get the keys and open that door.""

""But, sir‚Ä¶""

""Just do what I said!""

""Understood, sir. Sorry to bother you.""

Emma ran to get the keys and unlocked the door. When she entered and saw the scene before her, she couldn't help but scream.

""Ahh!!! Ma'am! What have you done?!""

Mary was unresponsive, her face streaked with blood, her arms covered in cuts.

""Ma'am, what have you done?!"" Emma cried out again.

Emma knelt down to try to lift her, but Mary had passed out. One of the cuts had severed an important vein, and she had lost a lot of blood. Emma panicked, started crying, and called emergency services. She dialed Maximus again, but seeing the call, he ignored it, assuming it was another issue related to his wife. With no response, Emma had no choice but to call Catherine.

""Mrs. Catherine, I'm sorry to bother you, but I don't know what to do anymore. Mrs. Mary just tried to take her own life. I called an ambulance, but it hasn't arrived yet. I tried calling Mr. Palmer, but I couldn't reach him. I'm going to the hospital with her.""

Catherine was speechless, but she quickly responded.

""What happened? Tell me! Explain!"" she said, her voice strained with anxiety. ""I'm on my way!""

Emma tried calling Maximus's number again, and this time, Matthew answered.

""Emma, what's going on? Why are you calling so insistently? The boss is in a very important meeting.""

""Matthew, Mrs. Mary just tried to hurt herself. The ambulance just arrived, and I'm going with her. I had to inform Mrs. Catherine. She's on her way to the hospital.""

Matthew's face went pale. Just yesterday, he'd seen Mary so calm. That calm had shattered today, and he knew it was because of what she'd witnessed yesterday.

""I'll inform the boss immediately. Keep me updated,"" Matthew said, his voice filled with worry.

Without a second thought, Matthew walked into the meeting room, fully aware he was only to interrupt if it was urgent. Maximus saw him enter and put on a cold expression.

""What's going on, Matthew?"" Maximus asked irritably.

""Sir, Emma just called. Mrs. Palmer attempted to take her own life and is on her way to the hospital.""

Maximus's face turned pale. He stood up from his chair and said, ""Gentlemen, I must leave. If there's anything urgent, please inform Matthew.""

With that, he walked out of the meeting room without another word.

""What exactly did Emma tell you?"" he asked Matthew as they walked.

""Only what I just told you. She didn't have time for more details. She's in the ambulance with the lady,"" Matthew responded.

At that moment, Alexia approached and asked Maximus, ""What's going on? Why did you leave the meeting so suddenly? We have to close the deal today; we can't afford to lose it,"" she said, annoyed.

""The deal will be closed, but I have to leave.""

""Maximus, where are you going?"" Alexia shouted, losing her composure.

""Alexia, don't forget that I'm the boss here, and you don't get to speak to me like that,"" Maximus said, holding her chin.

""Maximus, I'm sorry, but‚Ä¶""

""No buts. I have to go right now!""

Maximus hurried out, heading to the hospital, trying to understand what was happening. Today's argument had been minor compared to others. He couldn't fathom why his wife was acting this way. It didn't make sense to him. He thought that maybe it was their big age difference.

Chapter 0004

After what felt like a long journey, the ambulance finally arrived at the hospital. Mary was pale and unconscious. One of the paramedics said, ""She has lost a lot of blood. Let's hope we can still do something.""

Another said, ""We have to. She's so young, she can't die like this.""

""I don't know what could have gone through her mind to make her want to end her life. She's so young,"" one of the doctors remarked.

Meanwhile, in her subconscious, Mary was fighting against a very different reality. She was having the same nightmare again.

Mary found herself trapped in a mansion, alone and with a swollen belly, visibly conceived. She was crying, pleading to be let out, looking distressed. Next to her was Emma, trying to console her.

""Ma'am, please calm down. The baby shouldn't have to go through this!""

""Emma, I just want to leave. Please, I just want to get away. Why did Maximus lock me up here? I want to leave! He tricked me into coming here. He's planning to steal my baby.""

""Ma'am, the master only wants to keep you safe. His wife could harm you. That's why you're here. He doesn't want you to get hurt. Please, try to calm down.""

""No, Emma, he wants to take my child and then get rid of me. How could I have been so silly to fall into his trap?""

Suddenly, as if in a movie, the scene jumped to another moment in her life. Her baby had been born, and Maximus was holding the child tenderly. Mary lay exhausted, crying.

""Please, Maximus, you can't take her away from me. She's my daughter!""

""She's mine too! And the best thing for her is to grow up in a boarding school. You're no longer my wife. What kind of life could you offer her?""

""That's none of your business! You can't take my daughter away from me! You have a son!""

Unmoved, Maximus prepared to take the baby. But Mary, mustering all her strength, smashed a lamp over his head, knocking him unconscious to the floor. She grabbed her baby and ran. The afternoon was cold, and she ran out without shoes, with only a coat in which she wrapped her baby. She took advantage of the chaos and escaped from the mansion.

Again, the scene shifted, and every time it changed, she felt a pain in her chest, like something was trying to tear her soul apart. It felt like a burning sensation in her chest.

This time she found herself under a bridge. She was dirty, cold, holding her baby tightly while trying to breastfeed her. She had spent a long time on the streets, begging for money. She was hungry and weak, and her baby was crying. She was so tired that she gradually fell asleep, hugging her baby to shield her from the cold. The baby stopped crying. Suddenly, Mary woke up and realized her baby was no longer crying. Panic-stricken, she looked at her. The baby's face was pale and her lips had turned blue. Mary shook the baby, trying to wake her up, but she didn't respond. Her daughter had died from hunger and cold. A desperate scream echoed out, but on that cold afternoon, no one came to her aid.

Mary wept bitterly, blaming herself, hitting her face, begging for it all to be a bad dream so she could wake up soon.

""I'm sorry, my sweet daughter! I'm so sorry! I couldn't take care of you. Look at me‚ÄîI can't even take care of myself! I'm sorry!""

She saw the scene, pleading for it to be a nightmare.

""Please, God, let this be a nightmare! Please!""

As she repeated those words, she again felt something pulling her, burning her chest. Suddenly, she began to see a ray of light.

""Wake up! Please, wake up! You can't die!"" the chief doctor was saying.

Finally, Mary's pulse reappeared on the monitor.

""Doctor, the patient has a pulse. She made it!""

""Let's go; we need to keep treating her wounds. We can't declare victory yet.""

Dr. Xavier, the chief doctor, noticed a tear trickling from the corner of the girl's eye.

The doctor was intrigued. How could someone so young decide to take her own life? He couldn't believe she had a good enough reason to do something so desperate. Meanwhile, outside the emergency room, Emma and Catherine were waiting.

""Emma, you've worked with our family for so many years. That's why I asked you to stay with Maximus when he got married. I knew you'd take good care of him and Mary. Tell me, what happened?""

""Mrs. Catherine, I'm not sure. Yesterday, Mary left with a folder full of documents. She said she was going to deliver them to Maximus because he seemed to have forgotten them. Later, Matthew brought her back, and she locked herself in her room. Last night, the master came home and sent me away. He stayed alone with her, and I couldn't do anything after that. Today, they had a big argument, both shouting at each other, and she asked him for a divorce.""

""What?!"" Catherine responded in great surprise. ""That ungrateful Maximus must have done something to make Mary react this way.""

At that very moment, in the distance, she spotted a tall and imposing figure approaching.

""Maximus, you spoiled brat! Your parents didn't raise you this way. What did you do to Mary?""

""Grandma, I don't think this is the time to argue!"" Maximus said irritably.

""You insolent boy! It's my fault for spoiling you. As soon as Mary wakes up, she'll come to live with me. There's no going back.""

While Catherine was reprimanding Maximus, the chief doctor and a nurse emerged from the emergency room.

""Are you relatives of Miss Preston?"" asked the nurse.

""I'm her husband,"" Maximus responded solemnly.

""Sir, your wife lost a lot of blood. We had to perform a transfusion. Her blood type is rare, but we managed to save her. She's still in intensive care. One of the cuts she made hit a major vein, and that's what caused all of this. A few more minutes, and she would have died,"" the chief doctor said, his tone conveying both anger and concern.

Maximus's face turned pale, his expression distraught. She had seemed upset this morning, but he never thought it would go this far. A pang of guilt stabbed his stomach, guilt over what she'd witnessed in his office. He realized he might have pushed her too far. He had never really considered his wife's feelings. She had always told him she loved him and reminded him every day how much she adored him.

""Sir, even if she makes it out of danger, she'll need to be monitored closely. This time she didn't succeed, but that doesn't mean she won't try again,"" the chief doctor said seriously.

""What do you mean by that?"" Maximus asked, annoyed.

""You need to understand what drove her to attempt for death. You can't ignore this. We were able to save her this time, but people who go through traumatic experiences often try again until they succeed.""

Maximus was stunned by what he was hearing. ""How could Mary have done this? Was I being too hard on her?""

""You're ungrateful! I'm ashamed to be your grandmother! Tell me, how could you push Mary to this extreme? I already told you, as soon as she gets out of here, she's coming to live with me. And if she wants to leave you, I won't stop her!"" Catherine screeched.

Chapter 0005

As Maximus, Emma, and Catherine waited in a private room for news about Mary's condition, Catherine couldn't help but remember how the girl had come into their lives five years ago. Much of this information was unknown to Maximus.

Mary had been 17 years old when she was suddenly forced to leave her country. Her grandfather, Albert had called her at school and asked to see her when classes ended. Catherine recalled advising Albert that they should leave without telling anyone‚Ä¶

\-Flashback-

Albert had called the school and asked Mary to wait for him at the entrance in ten minutes. When he opened the car door, he saw his granddaughter, and she saw the man who had always been strong now looking distraught, his face full of anguish.

""Hurry, Mary, get in! We need to leave now‚Ä¶""

""Grandpa, what's going on? My things are still inside‚Ä¶""

""That doesn't matter anymore. Come on!""

She had no choice but to get in. She thought, 'Regina will pack up my things and bring them home this afternoon.' The car stopped at a hangar, and the driver asked for their phones.

""Sir, miss, I need your mobile devices and anything that can be tracked.""

""Go on, dear, give him what he asks for!""

""Grandpa?"" she responded, a bit scared.

""My dear, there's so much to explain, but there's no time right now. I'll tell you later, but please hand over your things.""

Left with no other choice, Mary handed over her phone. It was the only thing she had with her; there were no extra clothes except her school uniform and a locket with pictures of her mother and grandmother.

The driver handed the devices to another person, and they continued on. Something that caught Mary's attention was the driver's accent. They weren't local, that much was clear, but she couldn't figure out where they were from. Finally, the driver stopped at a hangar, and they saw a private plane.

""Sir, you need to board immediately. This is as far as I go. Someone will pick you up when you arrive at your destination.""

""Thank you so much, young man! I know how much you're risking by doing this. I will always be grateful to you.""

""No need to thank me. It's our job and our duty.""

Once on the plane, they took their seats. Mary's legs were trembling like jelly, and she was sweating cold. She didn't understand what was happening. All she knew was that it had to be serious.

""Dear, sit down and fasten your seatbelt. We're leaving soon.""

""Grandpa, where are we going? And why are we leaving like this? We don't have anything with us.""

The captain's voice came over the plane's speakers.

""Please take your seats and fasten your seatbelts. We will take off in five minutes.""

Once they were in the air, Albert relaxed a little. His expression softened, and his jaw was no longer clenched.

""Okay, now I can tell you what's going on, my dear.""

""What's happening, Grandpa?""

""Your father partnered with an old family friend to expand the construction business. This friend has been making shady moves and defrauding many businessmen. I'm the owner and legal representative, so there are arrest warrants out for me. They've seized everything. Your father and Aunt Camilla have also left the country, and we'll meet them soon.""

""But‚Ä¶where are we going?""

""I don't know, my dear. I had no choice. You're about to turn 18, and this problem would catch up to you as well. So I asked for a favor from some old family friends. You don't know them, but they are people of their word, and they just helped us leave the country.""

""Grandpa, I don't want anything to happen to you. I don't care what they take from us. I just want you to stay with me.""

""Don't worry, my dear. Little by little, we'll get through this. Our family lawyer has stayed behind to clear our name and to find the guy who got us into this mess.""

After more than twelve hours of flying, green hills and large mountains began to come into view, along with the emerald green of some lakes.

""Sir, miss, we've arrived. Please fasten your seatbelts; we're about to land,"" the captain's voice announced.

Upon landing, a car was already waiting for them. Albert began speaking in Valentian, and Mary realized that the men in Hesperia had spoken with the same accent. They had arrived in Valentia.

""Come on, dear, get in the car! They're waiting for us!""

""Yes, Grandpa!""

As they headed toward an uncertain destination, she observed the green fields, streets, and picturesque houses with flower-filled pots. The place seemed frozen in time. Suddenly, a huge mansion came into view. She was amazed‚Äîshe had never seen anything like it. The car entered the property, and an older woman was already waiting at the main door, her face radiating joy.

""Oh welcome, Albert!""

The woman spoke in Valentian, and Mary only understood the greeting. She was surprised to hear how fluently her grandfather began to speak.

""Dear, say hello to Mrs. Catherine Palmer!""

""But‚Ä¶""

""You can speak in Hesperian; she understands you.""

""Okay, hello, Mrs. Catherine!""

""What a beautiful girl! You are the spitting image of your mother!""

""You knew her?""

""In pictures, my child, only in pictures. I'm too old to travel now and never had the chance, but your grandmother used to send me photos.""

""I didn't know that!""

""Oh! We're very old friends. Our friendship goes back to the 1930s.""

""Wow!""

""Yes, my parents owed a lot to your great-grandparents. Much of what you see here was achieved thanks to your great-grandparents. Well, well, we'll have time to chat more later. For now, I think you should freshen up and get ready for dinner.""

""Thank you, ma'am! Thank you so much!""

""Your rooms are here and there. Albert, I think I still have some of my late husband's clothes in that room. Take whatever you need. The problem will be Mary‚ÄîI don't have any clothes for her. My grandsons are quite tall, so their clothes won't fit you, but we'll go shopping for some clothes first thing tomorrow.""

Mary entered her assigned room. It was huge and dark, and at night, it looked scary. The window overlooked the gardens. ""At least that's the only good thing. Tomorrow, in the daylight, everything will look different,"" she thought.

""Let's have dinner! The food is delicious!""

""Thank you, Catherine! Thank you so much for having us!""

Mary ate in silence. Mrs. Catherine spoke Hesperian but preferred Valentian, so it was hard for her to understand the conversation between her grandfather and their new acquaintance.

After dinner, Mary kissed her grandfather on the cheek and went to her room to rest.

""Thank you, Mrs. Palmer! I'm going to bed now.""

""You're welcome, dear! Go rest. Tomorrow is another day!""

Chapter 0006

After dinner, Catherine and Albert went to the study to discuss the troubling matter at hand.

‚ÄúAlbert, I‚Äôve reviewed the information your lawyer sent us. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have good news. Your supposed partner ran off with millions and offended one of the most prominent families in your country, which makes it difficult to take immediate action.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you suggest? I don‚Äôt have much left. I could turn myself in and avoid all this trouble.‚Äù",1,1749726360.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1l9jn81,https://www.flashscore.com/news/soccer-laliga-exclusive-barca-fitness-coach-believes-side-hold-advantage-over-rivals-after-club-world-cup/p6LnHGsp/,Barcelona fitness coach Julio Tous talks with Flashscore!,"#Julio Tous is a world reference in physical preparation. The current head of the department at Barcelona under Hansi Flick, he has worked for a decade with Antonio Conte, at Juventus, Chelsea, Inter and the Italian national team. In the first part of an exclusive interview with Sergio Levinsky, he reviews the latest football news for Flashscore.


**Flashscore: After such a successful season for¬†Barca, is there a Flick method or a Tous method?**

**Tous:** ""There is a Barcelona method, you could say a Barca method as well, which I think should be talked about because Barcelona is a city that has traditionally been characterised by innovation.¬†So, obviously, the spearhead, let's say, is Barca as an exemplary professional club, almost unique in the world, with the number of sports sections it has.There are two intersecting paths, what already existed in Barcelona and a coaching staff led by Flick, who comes with some ideas, obviously, from Germany, which creates a fantastic synergy.

 So, for me, that would be the most remarkable thing this season. In other words, suddenly when we start talking to Flick from the working group, we understand each other immediately, and he says: 'Go ahead, whatever you need, no problem'.¬†But, let's say, of those of us who train the players, this is probably one of the causes that has had the greatest impact, isn't it? That synergy between a, let's say, German culture with the culture of the Barcelona school or the Bar√ßa school.""

**Flashscore: In Paco Seirul-lo's book on Barca DNA, he says of you that 'the pupil has surpassed the master'. Did that phrase surprise you, or how did you take it?**

**Tous:** ""The truth is that I didn't sleep that night. It caused me tremendous pressure and what they call impostor syndrome. I've had a relationship with Paco for 30 years. It will be now that I know him, because I came here in 1995 and, and I think there is a mutual affection and probably, with that he wanted to say: 'Hey, I leave this legacy in good hands, it's not just me, but other colleagues who have developed, I understand, with very good results in other disciplines, in other clubs, in this same school in Barcelona that they said, no?'""

**Flashscore: Maybe that's what the method consists of, isn't it? Perhaps adapting the physical aspect to Barcelona's traditional football**.

**Tous:** ""This methodology of Paco Seirul-lo is the initial spearhead; it is designed solely and exclusively for team sports. And football is probably where there is the greatest possibility of applying it. All this started in handball, with a Barca that was devastating, that won a number of brutal European Cups and then moved on to football.

But in football, of course, there are more years, right? So, what happens? The big difference with respect to other methodologies that you can find worldwide, from very powerful schools, such as the German one, is that this was designed solely and exclusively for team sports. And the rest is an adaptation of individual sports.

And, for me, that is the mistake. So, let's see, the mistake, and this must be pointed out, is that there is always going to be an accumulated bias due to the fact that you have taken something from the world of athletics or the world of swimming and adapted it to a world like football, which is absolute chaos.

The most unpredictable thing there is football. So, these sports are cyclical and they are predictable and they are about performance and delivery. And football is a situational sport.

It's complex in the sense that it's constantly evolving and, of course, it's not going to work. Maybe, with a high-performance athlete or a high-performance footballer, who is a genius, despite training him in a way that is not the most appropriate, he is still going to impose himself, and he will be able to give results, right?

But, for me, the beauty of this method, which there is probably only one other similar method, but from a tactical point of view, which is Victor Frade's proposal for tactical periodisation, is that it is based on team sport. In other words, it is designed for that, not adapted.

This change is very important because Paco made an effort, because he himself came from athletics. But he said: 'We have to reinvent the theory of training'.

And there is a book coordinated by him prior to ADN Barca, which is the training of team sports, where all this is explained. It's about four or five years old and that's where all this proposal for structured, cognitive training is explained, applied to team sports, however you like, but good. In the end it is this proposal, the Barcelona school or Barca school.""

**Flashscore:There is another phrase of yours: 'It's not luck, it's science'...**

**Tous:** ""One of the first scientists in the world of football, Tom Riley, who was from Liverpool, we invited him here. I remember him saying: 'Football is not science, but science can help develop and improve football'.¬†

You have to point out, because science is based on something that is reproducible and someone in Argentina can take that same idea, take the same elements and reproduce it in Argentina, and you get the same thing.

So, be careful, because in football that's not going to happen normally. So, what happens? Let's call it a discipline that can benefit from scientific knowledge.Because obviously the human being works in a way, there are things that are more variable, others that are totally objectifiable and all that can help.

So, there is a lot of knowledge that has a scientific basis, that has been proven, that has been very useful for football, especially for injury prevention? Nowadays, the whole issue of big data, although people often go crazy with this data because they don't allow us to explain football either.

And if not, I think bookmakers are the biggest example. The bookmakers, I don't know if you bothered to look at the beginning of the season, the odds were six-to-one against Barca. We should all have been betting. And in the end, Barca wins the league against all odds. So, the algorithm that the bookmakers used, which supposedly you would think, I'm not saying it's infallible, but it's very tight, failed at that point.""


###The number of competitions in football is a real savagery


**Flashscore: You work a lot on strength to prevent injuries.**

**Tous:** ""Yes, yes, but also to increase performance. Of course I do. In today's football, the number of competitions that take place each year is a real savagery.This year, in addition, we have another one, which we do not compete in, fortunately, in the sense of protecting the health of the players.

Everyone would like to win the Club World Cup, and of course, it would be ideal, but from the point of view of prevention, it is a problem. There is a FIFA report that I remember that gave the example of¬†Lautaro (Martinez, who is now going to play in the Champions League final (editor's note: this interview was done before¬†PSG¬†vs¬†Inter), with a number of matches a year with less than five days between them, which was totally unbearable. In other words, it was not sustainable over time.

What has happened? There was no break on injuries and then the players also tended to lose performance or ability to perform on the pitch over the course of the season. It's logical to understand why, because they were overworked. What countermeasure can you do? Rotation.

But of course, if you are in a team like Barca, you want to win. So rotation is limited because you want to play with the best players. If you had two squads, you could do it moderately and have some young players play in the cup or something like that. But this measure is complicated.

So what other countermeasure can you do? Improve all the support at a conditional level, which is what is traditionally understood as physical preparation and support at a medical level, which are the ones that help you the most to endure this. And it is a dual function: to prevent, but also to maintain the performance that has been gained at the beginning of the season, especially in pre-season, and during the year, so that it does not fall into a tailspin. And what you do at the end of the year is micro-doses of work maintained throughout the year so that you don't lose what you gained at the beginning of the year in pre-season.""

**Flashscore: You weren't part of the original Flick staff, you were already at the club, and then Flick comes in, right?**

**Tous:** ""Exactly. And Flick arrives, who in a way accepts this structure that Barca has created, both from a physical and physiotherapy point of view, with a good number of physiotherapists.All of them have mastered some very effective, very innovative techniques that Ra√∫l Mart√≠nez has developed to allow the tissues to regenerate much better after an effort.""

**Flashscore: How do you see next season? Barcelona's two strongest rivals in LaLiga are¬†Real¬†and¬†Atletico Madrid. They are both playing in the Club World Cup. So, isn't Barcelona already at a big advantage in that respect?**

**Tous:** ""Yes, we can't deny that there has to be an influence because the number of matches accumulated this season for these two teams is going to be much higher. To that we have to add the games that the national team have. The two games they might have to play, at least. And it's going to be, I don't know whether to call it a drama, but it's going to be very complex to be able to regenerate all that accumulated competitive load in as little time as they have. Because LaLiga, if I'm not mistaken, starts in mid-August.""

  
###Madrid and Atleti will have to work very hard in the weeks they have on holiday


**Flashscore: So, how much time do they have to make up for that?**¬†

**Tous:** ""They will have to be very careful in the few weeks that they have of rest so that the player can reset mentally, but also regenerate on a physical level. And this is not easy, because of course, normally it is usually given, even if it is a week of saying: 'Look, forget about football, forget about training'.Enjoy with your family and after a week we'll start to move around a bit. But above all, I want you to forget about it mentally.

Reset, and from then on, we'll start working. I would almost say that they won't be able to afford it, because now they will be caught by those who arrive at the end of the pre-season, when the pre-season is almost over.There is no material time. In other words, it's that really, and this is probably what the institutions have to consider what they want, because they are really pushing the machinery, from my point of view, a lot.


 ###With¬†[Ter Stegen](https://www.flashscore.com/player/ter-stegen-marc-andre/byxc46yl/), as usual, they have tried to force as much as possible


**Flashscore: Speaking of individual players, what do you think Marc-Andre ter Stegen's problem is? Because a long injury for a goalkeeper normally takes time. However, there seems to be little patience with this.**

**Tous:** ""Let's see, this is the same as always. When you have a first-choice player who has been out for so long, everyone wants him to come back soon, and most importantly, so does he.Of course, you try to force as much as you can. So, at that level, what I also understand has happened this year is that there was suddenly a goalkeeper who had consolidated his position, and then there was the first-choice player who wanted to come back.

And of course, the timing was very tight. And in the end, the decision made by the coach, which is his decision, is taken, and all the staff behind him do what they have to do is to show the necessary data to support or not.

This is a case, maybe a goalkeeper is not going to be changed, but with an outfield player it is more usual to say to the coach: 'I wouldn't put him in for more than 30 minutes or I would put him right at the end, that's where he can make the most difference, he is ready for that, but not for more time'.Or you start him and then change him in the second half. You give him those kinds of instructions and then the coach decides, obviously, because the ultimate decision is his. But with a goalkeeper, it's perhaps the most delicate thing.

And of course, this year there was also the circumstance that Ter Stegen, when he came on as the starting goalkeeper, the team, as the coach said, hadn't lost.¬†So there was no reason to change him.So, it was a very delicate decision, but also, if there is another first-choice goalkeeper who has to have the feeling of coming back, then in the end it happened, I think, what we have all seen, that it was quite logical.""


 ###Lewandowski has an incredible work ethic


**Flashscore: Now I wanted to ask you about¬†Robert Lewandowski, who has performed spectacularly this season. How much can a player who is also a goalscorer score 40 goals in a season at that age, at that level? What is the secret to this?**¬†

**Tous:** ""Of course, it's always down to the player. And he is a player who has always taken great care of himself and who has an incredible work ethic and a predisposition to work that...

Let's see, I'm not going to make comparisons here either, but of course, they are strikers of such calibre that perhaps the striker as a rule that everyone has known, is perhaps a person who is more of a maverick, who goes his own way, who doesn't value the culture of work so much.

We always said, especially during my time in Italy of course, the defenders could be the physical trainers, because they have such a good training culture and such a predisposition that I could go and say: 'Guys, I don't know, Chiellini, Bonucci, Barzagli and so on, you run the session and I'm going for a coffee'.I mean, it's not normal for a striker, a goalscorer, to have that kind of discipline and character over the years, but Lewandowski at that level is an example.

Then, if you ask me as a specialist in these matters, I would say that if there is a¬†*booster*, a¬†*booster*¬†when you are relatively old for football, it is high-intensity neuromuscular work.Metabolic work has to be secondary in some way, everything that is long-duration work, etc.

And what allows you to keep competing is the neuromuscular. That's your power, your start and so on. Then, of course, that is related and you can, in some way, take the neuromuscular towards the metabolic, towards being resistant over time, the resistance to power. But the basis is the neuromuscular.If you don't have those structures prepared to generate high power and then train them to maintain power, injuries, performance drops,¬†*performance*¬†swings, this is going to happen to you. So, he's been very disciplined, and the programme for someone like him helps him enormously.""


 ###It amazes me how¬†Lamine¬†can be so mature and so stable at that age


**Flashscore: Now, I wanted to talk about Lamine Yamal. How do you work with a genius who is also in high-performance playing with seniors at the highest level?**

**Tous:** *""First of all, Lamine's quality, I think, is visible to any outside observer, but I have to admit that the first day I saw him, I had to rub my eyes.Because, all of a sudden, I saw a sort of, I don't know if I should call it something between a panther and a snake, moving at a very fast speed.And I said: 'I've seen what I've seen, if it's the first training session and he's already like that, and he's coming from doing nothing in theory, the quality this kid has is incredible'.*

*So, first of all, what's inside this kid is clear that to do what we see on the pitch, he has to be 24 carats? No, 48. Because we already see the body he has. I mean, he's not fully developed yet, and of course, the power he's capable of putting on a ball or in acceleration, in stopping, is dazzling.This internal wiring, I can assure you, is of a very high level. So that makes everything easier, because you either have it or you don't. Just like the great sportspeople in history were outstanding at that level.*

*What surprised me most about Lamine is how you can be so mature and somehow so stable in your behaviour at that age, because I certainly was not. I mean, I think that when we are that age, hormones kill us and you have days of ups and downs, fights with your mother, with your grandmother, with everyone, because you are an unstable teenager by definition.I think Barca and La Masia have done an incredible job in terms of education, because he is a polite, respectful boy, and you never see him in the dressing room doing anything out of place.*

*Like all the boys at La Masia, he has a very nice sporting culture. So, from that point on, it's very easy for us, because if you already have that base, you have no problem doing what you have to do.You apply what you think he needs on an individual level and then make the progression to the tailor-made suit. Lamine makes it much easier for anyone who works with him.""*


 ###Fermin got injured because of that lack of rest


**Flashscore: With¬†Fermin Lopez, you could say it's similar to Rodri; he played so many games last season, and that's why he had these injuries.**

**Tous:** ""Probably yes. What happens is that, also, Fermin got the injuries from the start because he hadn't really rested, and this was talked about because he played, if I remember correctly, in the Olympics and was in the European Championships that they (Spain) won.

The accumulation was brutal, and when he came to realise it, we had already started the season.He was given two weeks, if I remember correctly, and due to that lack of rest, and we can relate it to what we talked about before, it is likely that he also had a very rare injury with practically no intensity, breaking the rectus femoris in both legs.Fortunately, it had no major consequences, and in his specific case, he was able to undergo surgery. And we've, let's say, put him in cruising speed.""",18,1749726285.0,Barca,0,0.95,False

It stood out so much since it didn't match the lowly surroundings.   
  
At the same time, a girl in a pair of worn-out jeans walked toward the car with an emotionless face and an old suitcase in her hand.   
  
The middle-aged man in the driver's seat took a glance at the girl from the corner of his eye and let out an evident frown. It was obvious that he was dissatisfied with how plain she dressed.   
  
""Come on. Get in the car,"" the man instructed.   
  
Meanwhile, the girl remained expressionless.   
  
She was neither excited to be able to ride a luxury car nor was she frightened by the man's cold attitude.   
  
As instructed, she opened the car door and sat in the back seat.   
  
Inside, the girl quickly noticed that there was already another girl of her age sitting in the front passenger seat.   
  
She was dressed completely different compared to the girl in front of her, who donned gorgeous clothes and accessories that had never been seen in the whole town before.   
  
""So, that's her..."" Maria Jenkins softly mumbled to herself.   
  
She had recognized the girl in the passenger seat. It was Vivian Jenkins, the new actress who started gaining popularity in the country just recently and was quickly rising to fame.   
  
The man in the driver's seat looked at Maria through the rearview mirror and said, ""From now on, you will be my daughter. I am taking you back to Sheffield, where you'll live your new life. I'll arrange for someone to teach you how to behave befitting an affluent lady. Learn to adapt to your new identity as the daughter of the Jenkins family as soon as possible. By the way, this is Vivian, my daughter. You must have already seen her on the Internet.""  
  
But as soon as Bill Jenkins finished speaking, Vivian burst into silvery laughter.   
  
Speaking in Spanish, she commented, ""Dad, have you seen how poor she is? How could she possibly surf the Internet and watch my show?""  
  
At first, Bill was stunned that Vivian talked to him in fluent Spanish. But then, he nodded approvingly and replied in the same language, ""I see you've already made great progress in your Spanish. That's good, but that was a little impolite, dear.""  
  
Vivian chuckled and responded in Spanish again, ""Well, I'm afraid my new sister won't like what I said, so I chose to talk to you in this language.""  
  
Bill was actually amused by his daughter, but he cast her a faint smile and lightly shook his head. ""Although she can't be as excellent as you, she is still a distant relative. In fact, it will be ideal for us if she can become your substitute to marry into the Wilson family.""  
  
""Dad, how can you say that in front of her? Now, you're the one who's being impolite.""  
  
Under the assumption that their conversation would be incomprehensible to Maria, they continued conversing in Spanish without scruple.   
  
Besides, they had investigated the town in advance. There were only two Spanish teachers in this remote place, and they didn't even graduate college.   
  
If the teachers' standard was already that poor, then they could only conclude that Maria's education was also subpar. In other words, it should be impossible for her to understand what they were talking about.   
  
Before long, the luxury car drove out of the impoverished town.   
  
Since Maria didn't have anything better to do on the way to her new home, she took out an old laptop from her backpack while the two were chatting.   
  
All this time, she acted like she really didn't understand their conversation and began typing away.   
  
""Oh! You know how to use a laptop, Maria?""  
  
Seeing the device sitting on Maria's lap, Vivian couldn't help but raise an eyebrow.   
  
As far as she knew, there were indeed more than a hundred families in that worn-down town whose surname was Jenkins. Although her father managed to climb up the ladder, he still had blood ties to these poor, annoying relatives.   
  
Maria lost her parents at a young age, so she grew up with the help of these relatives.   
  
It was already a miracle that she didn't starve to death as an orphan and even graduated from high school without any problem.   
  
Due to her living situation, it was unthinkable that she could possess a laptop.   
  
""This? It's just for playing games,"" Maria answered in a low and indifferent voice.   
  
Hearing her flat tone, a trace of contempt flashed through Vivian's eyes.   
  
Did she just say that it was for playing computer games?   
  
But then, Vivian realized that she shouldn't be surprised. This kind of entertainment was only suited for ordinary people like Maria.   
  
Vivian also noticed that the surface of the laptop looked so old that she couldn't even identify the brand.   
  
""How much did you buy it for?"" She continued to feign her curiosity just to find out how Maria got it.   
  
""I didn't spend anything for it."" After a brief pause, Maria elaborated, ""I worked in a small digital shop back in town. When the shopkeeper couldn't afford my salary, he started giving me spare parts as compensation. Eventually, I managed to assemble this laptop myself.""  
  
It turned out to be an assembled laptop from old spare parts.   
  
What a low-end digital product. Surely, just as Maria said, it could only be used for nothing more than playing games.   
  
At the same time, Vivian also wasn't that knowledgeable about computers, so she immediately believed that Maria's laptop was nothing but a piece of junk.   
  
""Well, I guess that laptop matches you very well."" Vivian giggled and let out subtle smirk.   
  
  
  
  Master M  
  
Out of growing curiosity, Vivian narrowed her eyes. ""Maria, how much was your salary supposed to be? I can't imagine why your boss couldn't even afford to pay you in full.""  
  
As a matter of fact, she really was wondering how Maria got by back in that seedy town.   
  
Her father was a known wealthy businessman in Sheffield.   
  
At the same time, Vivian was also making a name for herself. Aside from signing to Yeez Entertainment, she had already obtained lots of resources just half a year after her debut.   
  
After nailing her role in a TV series and a reality show, she easily made over a million dollars.   
  
On the other hand, Maria worked in a digital shop in a small town after graduating from high school, so Vivian couldn't help but take an interest in how much she was earning from that kind of job. In the back of her mind, Vivian even suspected what Maria earned was probably nowhere near what she spent on her mani-pedi.   
  
""The income isn't fixed. It depends on the orders we receive in the shop. Unfortunately, the shop wasn't really doing well recently. There were only a few orders, and my boss seemed to be running at a loss lately so he was forced to give me laptop parts and accessories as compensation.""  
  
Maria elaborated as if it was nothing. Finding it very amusing, Vivian chuckled again.   
  
""You got paid based on orders you received? Isn't that the same as being a temporary worker in a factory?""  
  
After that comment, Vivian didn't say anything more. She just lightly shook her head and let out a sigh of pity. In her mind, Maria's job was no different from being a lowly production worker.   
  
At this time, a chat box suddenly popped up on Maria's computer screen.   
  
""Master M, please advise if you could take this job. Thank you.""  
  
Seeing this message, Maria took a quick glance at the order request. It read, ""The website of an international Children's Charity Foundation was attacked by hackers. They are urgently requesting to reinforce their firewall.""  
  
Then, she looked further and saw that the payment for the job was only three hundred thousand dollars.   
  
Maria's network ID in her line of work was M, but the staff addressed her as Master M to show utter respect. Apparently, she was a member of Heaven, a well-known hacker organization. The staff would receive orders or jobs from various companies and groups, and they would forward them to hackers of this organization, such as Maria, to take them on.   
  
Since the reward for this particular request was only three hundred thousand dollars, it was impossible to persuade a divine-level hacker in Heaven to take the job. In fact, this amount barely met the standard fees of ordinary hackers inside the organization.   
  
However, this charity organization encountered a special situation. Their website was supposed to be very safe and secure, but it still got infiltrated by hackers. If they wanted to reinforce and upgrade their system's defense, they would need a specialist‚Äîone with higher technical capabilities. Of course, the average-level hackers in Heaven weren't suited for the job.   
  
Fortunately, the staff knew that among the few divine-level hackers, only Master M would take orders based on her mood and not the reward.   
  
If the client was lucky enough, even if they could only pay a mere thirty thousand, Master M might consider taking the job.   
  
Therefore, with this in mind, the staff tried to push his luck and came to Maria. While waiting for her reply, he couldn't help but feel extremely anxious.   
  
""Fine. Ask the client to send the IP address and all relevant data. I'll update it online soon.""  
  
Getting the affirmative reply he was hoping for, the staff was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief, then quickly relayed the information to the client.   
  
Soon enough, Maria received everything she asked for.   
  
Before starting, she cracked her knuckles and began to tap the keyboard with her fingers as light and accurate as possible. She was like a pianist whose fingers danced harmoniously. Her beautiful and clear eyes were fixed on the computer screen the whole time as if she was being drawn to it.   
  
At the same time, her laptop was equipped with a silent keyboard. That way, no matter how fast she typed, it wouldn't make any sound.   
  
It only took a short while for Maria to write a complex set of codes. Even for those who had knowledge in this field, her codes seemed to be as obscure as a mystic foreign language.   
  
""It's done.""  
  
Maria messaged the staff as soon as she finished the task.   
  
Normally, upon the completion of an order, the client would check the work first before proceeding with the payment.   
  
However, when the client learned that it was Master M who had taken the job, they already transferred the money to her account without having to check first.   
  
In just a matter of a few minutes, Maria finished a tedious task and gained a commission of three hundred thousand dollars.   
  
""Excellent! Thank you so much, Master M! You saved a lot of charity funds just in the nick of time. Those kids who will receive financial help from our client will definitely be grateful to you!""  
  
""No need to thank me. It's my job, and I got paid for it. It's just normal business.""  
  
As soon as Maria sent her reply, she exited the chat box and closed the laptop lid.   
  
""Oh, you're done playing?""  
  
It turned out that Vivian had been observing Maria all this time. Apparently, she had a feeling that her new sister looked particularly occupied just for a game. She wasn't too stupid not to suspect that Maria was doing something else.   
  
""It ran out of battery..."" Maria replied casually like it was a usual occurrence.   
  
""Really? Ha-ha!""  
  
Hearing this response, Vivian couldn't help but laugh hard. All her suspicions earlier had been set aside.   
  
Now, all she could think of was how lousy this laptop was.   
  
Maria had only been using it for less than thirty minutes, but it had already run out of power.   
  
She believed it was nothing compared to her laptop. After all, Vivian just bought a new one three months ago which cost her a fortune. With its high-end specs, it could run for twenty-four hours straight without having to connect to a power source.   
  
  
  
 New Home  
  
After quite a long drive, the trio finally arrived at a river-view villa.   
  
As soon as Maria got out of the BMW, she saw a maid waiting for them at the gate.   
  
""Mr. Jenkins, Miss Jenkins, welcome back! I have been waiting for you guys. Lunch is ready.""  
  
""Yes, please. I'm starving! Did you cook my favorite garlic shrimp, Lily?""  
  
Vivian asked with an expectant look. At the same time, the maid called Lily hurriedly took her bag with a warm smile.   
  
""Yes, of course! Everything's ready inside. Please go wash up and enjoy the lunch."" Lily adored Vivian so much. She always looked at the young woman as if she was an avid fan looking up at her idol.   
  
""You've just arrived, so you shouldn't be familiar with the surroundings. Anyway, Lily, the maid here, will show you around the house. For now, she will accompany you to the room I prepared for you,"" Bill said flatly.   
  
Then, he turned to Lily and instructed her, ""This is Maria. From now on, she'll be part of this family, as my daughter of course. Show her to her room so she can settle down first.""  
  
""Yes, Mr. Jenkins, right away.""  
  
Lily bowed respectfully before standing still again.   
  
However, instead of a welcoming smile, she glanced coldly at Maria and didn't bother helping her carry her luggage as she did for Vivian just now.   
  
""Come with me."" Indifference resonated in Lily's voice as she turned around and walked toward the house.   
  
On the other hand, Maria didn't say anything. She just quietly followed Lily while carrying her own suitcase.   
  
In fact, her suitcase gave off a dull sound when its wheels ran over the floor, indicating just how heavy it really was.   
  
Even so, no one really noticed that Maria casually carried it with one hand and had no trouble with it.   
  
""This is going to be your bedroom,"" Lily uttered as she stopped in front of a door.   
  
She took Maria to a room on the first floor. Inside its narrow interior, there was a single bed, a simple wardrobe, and a desk and chair set. There wasn't a lot of furniture in the room, but it already felt so clamped. There was basically no more space for any other stuff.   
  
Before entering, Maria looked at the stairs leading to the second floor.   
  
Noticing where her gaze was, Lily sneered and caught her attention. ""This river-view villa district was developed by a real estate enterprise well-known internationally. The internal layout of this three-floor villa is incredibly unique and sophisticated. It can only be built with top-level design skills and artistic structure. Now, you are going to live on the first floor. Do not dare go to the upper floors if you have no business in there. Also, it might be your first time in a place this big, so be careful and try not to get lost. Don't say I didn't warn you.""  
  
Lily's tone was harsh enough to let Maria know that she wasn't trying to hide her contempt towards a bumpkin like her.   
  
At the same time, the maid indeed wasn't exaggerating about the size of the place. When she first came to the Jenkins family, Lily had lost her way several times in the passageways around the villa. One time, she even entered the master's bathroom completely by mistake.   
  
If it weren't for her excellent cooking skills that helped her win Vivian's favor, she would have been fired a long time ago.   
  
""Yeah, I do know something about such villas."" Maria replied calmly, shifting her gaze towards the room in front of her.   
  
""You do? Ha!""  
  
Lily snorted so hard as though she heard a distasteful joke.   
  
Maria was nothing more than an ordinary girl from a small town near the countryside, a mere substitute for Vivian's engagement. Now, she was claiming that she understood how complicated and exquisite the structure of the villa was. Of course, Lily found it laughable.   
  
In fact, it wasn't until recently that she heard from another maid in a neighboring villa about the history of the river-view villa district. Its design was created by a mysterious and low-key top-level designer, and it was obtained by a real estate enterprise at a remarkably steep price.   
  
It was said that the top-level designer was unwilling to take the job at first. However, she happened to be in urgent need of money, so she eventually agreed to do this.   
  
Unexpectedly, the designer finished all the intricate designs and layouts in just a day.   
  
Considering that she finished the job so fast, the head of the real estate enterprise suspected that her work was perfunctory. He complained to many people and even claimed that the designer was a scammer who tried to ask for a huge amount of money for a lackluster output. In other words, he tried to discredit her abilities.   
  
About three months later, however, a world-famous design competition bestowed a Gold Award on the designer's works. Apparently, her genius was undoubtedly genuine.   
  
In order to save face, the head of the estate enterprise immediately issued a public apology. Unfortunately for him, when he tried to contact the designer personally for a new project, he learned that he and his company were already blacklisted.   
  
In the age where this kind of news could quickly circulate around the Internet, the design circle soon learned that the designer embargoed the company. As a result, many other famous designers refused to cooperate with them from then on.   
  
Eventually, the head and his company incurred extremely heavy losses that he had to leave the real estate industry and test his luck somewhere else.   
  
""Anyway, please remember to stay in your room at all times. I will call you when it's time to eat. More importantly, don't make any noise in your room. I am staying in the room next to yours, and I have been having troubles sleeping properly recently. I don't want to be awakened from my rest just because you're making unnecessary ruckus in your room! Do you understand?"" Lily raised an eyebrow and crossed her arms in front of her chest.   
  
Maria could only smile mirthlessly. It was clear that her new identity as the lady of the Jenkins family didn't have any authority at all.   
  
  
  
  Cooking Noodles  
  
Unbeknownst to everyone, Maria had narcolepsy.   
  
In fact, she also didn't bother saying this to her new family.   
  
But because of this disease, she had the tendency to sleep more than the normal duration. Sometimes, it could even go up to twenty-four hours.   
  
When Maria had a narcolepsy attack, she wouldn't be able to prevent herself from sleeping on the spot. This meant that she could be prone to accidents or even suffocation.   
  
This was why the consequences of her condition could be fatal.   
  
Unfortunately, Maria had a relapse soon after she moved in with the Jenkins family.   
  
She was only supposed to take a nap, but when she woke up, it was already eight o'clock in the evening.   
  
No one came and tried to wake her up. Hence, Maria wasn't able to have dinner.   
  
""Lily, is there anything else to eat? I overslept, and now I'm hungry.""  
  
Maria found Lily in the living room, so she asked her for some food.   
  
""Oh, you're finally up. I thought you're not going to wake up anymore!""  
  
Lily said sarcastically.   
  
""Anyway, Mr. Jenkins has taken Miss Jenkins to a concert, so they won't be home until later tonight. Besides cooking, I also have to deal with all the other house chores. You missed dinner, but it's not my fault. Don't expect me to cook for you now. There are noodles, vegetables, and some meat in the fridge. You're from the countryside, right? I believe even you should be able to cook a noodle dish for yourself.""  
  
For someone who also came from a poor family, Lily thought that a bumpkin like Maria should at least know how to cook.   
  
After all, they had no one else to rely on but themselves.   
  
On the other hand, Maria couldn't help but look at Lily, who said that she was busy with the house chores.   
  
Despite what she said, she was actually sitting on the sofa and watching a drama show on TV with a huge bowl of popcorn.   
  
Upon seeing the maid munching, Maria could only roll her eyes hard. Only a fool would believe Lily's words.   
  
""It's okay. I'll make something for myself.""  
  
Left with no choice, Maria went straight to the kitchen.   
  
Looking at her receding figure, Lily smiled complacently.   
  
""Do this fake daughter of Mr. Jenkins really think that she can boss me around? I don't think so!"" Lily scoffed coldly, mumbling to herself.   
  
She thought that only the true members of the Jenkins family were qualified to treat her as a helper around the house. After all, she and Maria should have only come from the same background.   
  
After a while, Lily started to hear some noises coming from the kitchen.   
  
It was the sound of vegetables being cut quickly and skillfully. She couldn't help but furrow her brows. Although she couldn't see it in person, she somehow wondered if Maria was actually more skilled at cooking than her.   
  
""Ha! Impossible!"" Lily took pride in her cooking. After all, it was the main reason why she was still in this household.   
  
But a few minutes later, a spectacular fragrance spread out from the kitchen.   
  
The moment Lily took a whiff of it, she couldn't stop herself from swallowing hard.   
  
What was Maria cooking?   
  
How on earth could a simple noodle dish smell this good?   
  
Lily's eyes narrowed, assuming that Maria might have had a unique recipe. That was why even a simple dish could smell so appetizing.   
  
""If I can learn it, the Jenkins family will be more satisfied with my cooking. Then, maybe they will decide to give me a raise!""  
  
Lily almost drooled in excitement. She couldn't wait to make it come true.   
  
Therefore, she went to the dining room and waited patiently for Maria to come out. When she heard the footsteps coming from the kitchen, she put on her brightest smile.   
  
""Are you done? What did you cook? Let me have a look‚Äî""  
  
It was Lily's first time acting kindly towards Maria, but the smile on her face was replaced with disappointment and confusion when she saw Maria came out of the kitchen without bringing anything.   
  
""Noodles,"" Maria answered without any hint of interest in her eyes.   
  
""Yeah, I know. But where is it?"" Lily asked, her tone getting a little impatient.   
  
""I already ate everything. I told you I was hungry."" Lily's face froze upon hearing this. On the other hand, Maria just walked past her and went to the front door. ""I'm just going out for a walk and have some fresh air.""  
  
Lily didn't answer back, and she only regained her senses when Maria closed the door after going out.   
  
She badly wanted to know Maria's secret recipe, but she was too proud to ask her directly. Instead, she thought of going to the kitchen to see if there were any clues left behind.   
  
Unfortunately for her, Maria washed the dishes she used after she ate. The kitchen was as spotless as before. Everything was the same, except for the lingering satisfying smell of the noodle dish.   
  
""Humph! I can still ask her next time. I don't believe she will dare hide it from me deliberately!"" Lily was obviously dissatisfied.   
  
At the same time, even though a long time already passed, the exquisite aroma still wafted around the villa.   
  
After a while, the front door opened again, but it was Vivian who entered. She and her father had just returned from the concert.   
  
""Wow! What is that? It smells so good!""  
  
Vivian's eyes widened in delight as she looked at Lily.   
  
""Lily, what did you cook? May I please have some?""  
  
Lily didn't know what to say. She thought that admitting that the sensational aroma actually came from the noodle dish cooked by Maria would make her lose face.   
  
""Oh, that? I got a little hungry, so I cooked some noodles earlier. However, I've already finished all of it. There's nothing left."" Although, it wasn't very noticeable, Lily's face flushed red in embarrassment.   
  
""Then go and cook some more for me! I can wait!"" Vivian ordered at once.   
  
Hearing this, Lily was stunned. She realized that she didn't think her answer thoroughly.   
  
Now, she was in a huge dilemma, and she also made a fool of herself.   
  
Of course, she could still cook Vivian a noodle dish. But it wouldn't be as appetizing as the one cooked by Maria. Then, she would be caught lying.   
  
But before Lily could answer again, a dignified and aloof lady came in and patted Vivian on the shoulder.   
  
""It's so late already. No midnight snacks.""  
  
Vivian could only let out a disappointed sigh. Then, she answered reluctantly, ""Alright, mom...""  
  
  
  
Lies Of Masters  
  
This was Vivian's mother, Julie Jenkins.   
  
She entered the house, wearing an elegant dress and gorgeous makeup, yet she had this cold expression on her face. As she looked around, her eyes narrowed as they caught something displeasing.   
  
There was an evident frown on her face the moment she saw the bowl of popcorn on the coffee table and some even on the carpet, as if some barbaric person without manners lived there.   
  
""Is it you?""  
  
Noticing the disgust in the hostess's tone, Lily panicked and decided to pass the blame. After all, she wouldn't want to incur the wrath of the Jenkins family. ""No, ma'am... Maria left them there.""  
  
Hearing Maria's name, Julie remembered that there was now a new daughter in the household of the Jenkins family.   
  
""She just left her trash there? Where is that girl now?""  
  
Julie raised an eyebrow, and her annoyance just grew even more. Her first impression of the adopted daughter was instantly shattered just because of Lily's selfish lies.   
  
Swallowing hard, Lily almost stammered, ""Mrs. Jenkins, a-after eating... the popcorn... Maria said that she will go out for a walk.""  
  
Julie shook her head and didn't want to hear any more. She then turned to her husband with a disapproving expression. ""Are you hearing this? How could a young girl go out this late at night alone? Bill, have you really thought this through? the girl you took back may become the disgrace of our family!""  
  
With a long face, Bill sighed and nodded. ""You're right. I will lay some ground rules for her. She can't do whatever she wants to just like that.""  
  
After exchanging a few more words to express their disappointment, the couple went back to their bedroom on the second floor.   
  
""Hey, Lily! Remember to cook that noodle dish for me next time, okay?""  
  
Vivian reminded Lily unhappily before also going back to her room on the third floor.   
  
Meanwhile, on the riverside, the scenery looked very beautiful. The river glimmered with dotted lights, and the water's flow sounded so calming.   
  
This was indeed a high-end villa district. Even though it was her first time in this new environment, Maria didn't worry about her safety at all.   
  
The Jenkins family didn't know that aside from the self-assembled laptop, Maria also had a mobile phone.   
  
It was pure black in color, and like her laptop, the brand trademark wasn't present. It looked almost like a cheap knockoff phone she bought for two dollars from a thrift store.   
  
But even though it wasn't branded, in terms of functionality and security, this mobile phone far exceeded almost all of the commercially available ones.   
  
The top-level hackers of Heaven were issued with this special mobile phone that they could use in their jobs. Through this device, they could access the latest information and data in Heaven's database at any time.   
  
At this time, while Maria enjoyed the tranquil surroundings, she opened her mobile phone and sent a message to the chat room of Heaven's members.   
  
There was only one sentence, but it instantly caused a massive uproar. She said, ""I'll be suspending all my business transactions from here on.""  
  
""What?! Master M! Why will you stop taking job requests? I just got a big order from a top-500 enterprise. They need to rebuild their internal network. I was hoping you could do it. No one wants to accept it because the job request is so demanding!""  
  
""Of course, this is just temporary, right? When are you returning, Master M?""  
  
""I also have many clients who are specifically asking for you.""  
  
""Hmm... That's so sudden. Let me guess... Master M, have you fallen in love with someone? Oh, what a lucky guy!""  
  
Actually, the only information that Maria let them know was her gender. Aside from that, her identity was a complete enigma.   
  
""What are you guys saying? I have just graduated from high school. I don't have time yet for trivial things such as love. Anyway, there's also a chance that I may not continue studying in the future. I have recently moved to Sheffield to start my new life here.""  
  
Maria didn't want to be lied to, so she also had no intention of doing it.   
  
However, not because she told the truth meant that everyone would believe her. In fact, most of them thought that it was just an excuse.   
  
""Ha-ha! Master M, that's too much. Did you say that you just graduated from high school? So, you mean that I, a doctor who graduated from a prestigious university, was destroyed by a high-school student in Heaven's hacking competition three years ago? That's just ridiculous!""  
  
""Didn't Master Night also do this last time? He said that he will suspend his business because he was hospitalized due to a car accident, and he needed time to recuperate.""  
  
""Oh, right. I remember that! The following day after Master Night announced his supposed hiatus, an overseas hacker attacked us. But out of nowhere, Master Night dealt with it without much effort. If it weren't for that hacker, we would have fallen for Master Night's brilliant ruse!""  
  
""I agree! It's just to be expected that even at deceptions, the masters are very good!""  
  
""Ha-ha! I think I know this. Women may have issues with their age. So it's kind of like 30 never, 18 forever! Am I right, Master M?""  
  
While Maria read the messages at the chat room, she could only shake her head lightly while letting out a faint smile. Although they were not familiar with each other on a personal level, they made her feel a sense of warmth and belonging.   
  
""Welcome to Sheffield.""  
  
Maria's brows slightly furrowed as she received a private message.   
  
Upon checking the ID of the sender, it turned to be from Night.   
  
Like Maria, he was one of the divine-level hackers in Heaven, known as Master Night.   
  
""Oh, thanks."" But then after thinking for a while, Maria found it to be weird. So, she added, ""Does that mean that you believe me? But none of the others do.""  
  
Meanwhile, in the Wilson family's residence in Sheffield, a man in a wheelchair was holding the same black mobile phone that the hackers from Heaven were also using.   
  
Then, he sent another message addressed to Maria.   
  
""Well, yes. I believe whatever you say.""

Context: A guy has been hyper vigelent of me, he is always staring and blushing. He comes up to me and then runs away. Others have commented on his attention.

His family visited from perth, they knew who i was before i knew who they were (easy to idnetify his twin brother tho). His brother basically interviewed me. We fought to answer ask questions and he laugjed with his head back like the guy i like does. He told me his twin was single and that he had been watching his brother and i together. Turns out we have the same world views, like country music and the country, surfing and have both travelled for work. This guy i like turns up at the end, hugs me when he finds out my Grandma just passed. I give him a little rub back. And tells me he will check up on me next week after the funeral. He hands me my cardigan likes its something prescious and blushes. His family who ride in his car let us go ahead by ourselves. 

The next week I'm numb with grief and this guy i like seeks me out, he asks me all these questions but i find it so hard to connect because I've just buried my Grandma and havent had more then 3 hrs sleep (havent been able to eat either :( ). 

He runs out on our convo to talk to someone then goes and sits in his car even though he said he would come back. I go to him because i dont want to wait. We talk a bit. He says he has buried someone he loves too, but doenst elaborate when i ask.
He asks after my days off. He says he will spend time ith me next saturday having coffee. He remembers where i live and will come to my suburb and we can get coffee there together. He then tells me on the one day his family was up from perth they went to all the places I reccomended to his siblings.
He tells me we are complimentary in our approach to work and he is glad about that.
He walks me to my car, telling me he will have to remember where i park and what my car looks like. and carries my stuff to the car and hugs me.

The next day he cancels the date. Saying he is busy and he liked talking to me but he has 'stuff to get through'. 
He ignores my question to reschedule just dodges it and says he is bad at texting.

Next week he sits behind me again. Watches me with my friends. Walks his friend out, sits in the car, then turns it off, comes right in, makes a beeline for me like a terminator. I catch him staring at me as he zooms towards me and he diverts. I call out and invite him into the group and he joins, chats, briefly mentions he hopes i have a nice few days off (remebered a small detail from last week). And then goes to leave. I walk him out and he offers to hold my stuff gain, and insisits. He tells me he had a relaxed week (which contridicts his busy week excuse for cancelling). He apologies for swearing to me with over exagerated body language (idm srsly if he knew what i did for work). Tells me he had a habit of being on his phone too much growing up so turns his phone off (which is fine tbh, im the same). And tells me he loves how pasionate i am about what i do. He seems really pleased abt my plans for the rest of the night and encourages me abt them. 
Since then hes been VERY active on messenger which contradicts his prior statement to me and still has nkt viewed my past message.

Why did he pull back? But then come back?

Was he scared off by my grief?


He said he knew what it was like to loose family, surely he knows i wasnt me that night we were alone after my Grandma's funeral and didn't attribute my grief to who I am compared to usual happy self he knew me, and enjoyed me as, before she passed..",0,1749726165.0,Bumble,2,0.5,False

I had one or 2 a year, then went about 4 years with out one, and I have had 2 in the last 6 months. I can't find a cause, twice I was not at work, but the others I have been. There doesn't seem to be a correlation to food. Once it was early in the morning and all I had eaten that morning was a piece of toast and a cup of coffee. 

What happens is I will first notice that I can't focus on a particular point. Like if I look down at my hand and I try to focus on my fingernail I just can't see it. Similar to how you can't see your nose. Within 5 minutes or so, there will be a white  spot thats somewhat indistinguishable, like if you looked into a bright light for a few seconds then tried to look at a painting on a wall. 10 mins after that I lose my peripheral vision. My vision goes from normal 180ish degree to like 45 degrees. About 15 mins after that my vision will return to normal over a 10 minute period, but I still feel like I have looked into a very bright light. During that time I usually get pretty nauseous. Sometimes worse than others. Before the nausea goes away a headache starts and becomes a migraine. I have only ever gotten relief from the migraine by going to sleep. I had one of these yesterday.

""Edmund, you have been married to Chelsea for three years. It's high time you had a child. I want to meet my great-grandchildren before death comes for me.""  
  
An old man's earnest voice came from the study through the slightly opened door.   
  
A young man replied coldly, ""Why should I have a baby with a woman I don't love?""  
  
Chelsea Williams was about to knock on the door to inform them that dinner was ready. But when she heard their conversation, she froze. Her face turned pale in a split second.   
  
The young man's voice sounded again. This time it was firmer and dismissive. ""Grandpa, just so we are on the same page, you'll not be getting any great-grandchildren from me as long as I'm married to Chelsea. I don't want her to be the mother of my children. So, don't pester me about this issue again!""  
  
""You brat!"" the old man shouted angrily. The next second, the sound of a cup being shattered on the floor was heard. This was followed by the sound of approaching footsteps.   
  
Chelsea hurriedly went into the bathroom next door to hide. In the process, the sharp edge of the wash-hand basin scratched her waist.   
  
An intense pain shot from her waist to her heart. It then swept through her entire body. She trembled and bit her lower lip hard. Tears of agony soon welled up in her eyes.   
  
Only a few days ago, she had received a pregnancy test result from Diane Stevenson, the mistress of her husband, Edmund Nelson.   
  
Along with the test result came harsh mockery.   
  
""Chelsea, what a miserable woman you are! Although you have been married to Edmund for three long years, he still hasn't fallen in love with you.   
  
You live under the same roof with him, but he hates you with every fiber of his being. Don't you have any shame? How could you stick with a man whose heart belongs to someone else? Gosh! If I were you, I would have died of shame long ago.""  
  
Chelsea didn't know of Diane's existence before she got married to Edmund.   
  
On their wedding night, Edmund didn't stay at home. He left her as soon as the ceremony came to an end. The next morning, Chelsea woke up to a piece of shocking news. Her husband was sighted entering and leaving a hotel with a popular female star the night before. The news was the talk of the town.   
  
It was on that day that Chelsea realized that her husband's heart belonged to someone else.   
  
Not willing to give up on her new marriage, Chelsea decided to stay. She hoped that Edmund would fall in love with her someday. She resigned from her job and became a full-time housewife.   
  
Unfortunately for her, nothing changed even after three years.   
  
As Chelsea went down memory lane, the door of the bathroom was pushed hard from outside. She staggered and held the washstand.   
  
She looked up with teary eyes only to see a cold man coming in. It was her husband, Edmund.   
  
The ice in his eyes could have frozen lava. The black suit he had on today made him look more unfriendly than ever. He strode to her, grabbed her shoulders, and inquired aggressively, ""Did you incite Grandpa to put pressure on me to have a baby with you? You have become more scheming over the years. What makes you think I want you to be the mother of my child? Have you gone mad?""  
  
Grabbing her shoulders even tighter, Edmund added furiously, ""You set me up and forced me to marry you three years ago. Now, you want to make sure you remain in this family by having my child. Over my dead body!""  
  
Chelsea's face turned red. She bit her lower lip and said, ""I didn't.""  
  
""You didn't? Why then is he putting pressure on me? And why were you eavesdropping on our conversation?"" Edmund sneered.   
  
In a clipped tone, he continued, ""Since you heard our conversation, you should know how I feel about you. You disgust me, Chelsea. You are not worthy to bear a child for me.""  
  
Chelsea clenched her fists tightly when she heard those cruel words. Her nails were on the verge of piercing into her palms.   
  
She knew fully well that Edmund didn't love her, but her heart broke into a thousand pieces when he said that she wasn't worthy of carrying his child.   
  
For the past three years, Chelsea had put in her all in an effort to make this marriage work. She remained a dutiful wife despite his infidelity.   
  
Day and night, she held up hope that Edmund's heart would one day soften towards her. However, his heart went from being an iceberg to heavy lead. Nothing she did melted it.   
  
""Edmund, please be honest with me. In the past few years, have you... Have you ever loved me even if it was for a second?""  
  
Chelsea's voice was low and pitiful. Her body was shaking violently as if she asked that question with all the strength and courage she had.   
  
This sudden inquiry sent an inexplicable emotion to Edmund's heart. But it lasted only for a millisecond.   
  
The coldness in his eyes increased. ""What do you think? You are not so dumb, are you? Judging by what's happening now, you should be able to answer that question yourself!""  
  
The disdain in his response pierced through Chelsea's heart like a knife. All the hurt that she kept tucked away bubbled to the surface at this moment.   
  
  
  
     
  
Edmund's words shattered her last hope.   
  
Everything she did to win Edmund's love went down the drain. It was as if she had made a fool of herself for three whole years.   
  
""I see."" With these words, Chelsea released herself from his grip and walked out of the bathroom dejectedly.   
  
Her shoulders were slouched and her walk was unsteady. However, there was a trace of determination on her teary face. Edmund took a step forward, feeling pity for her subconsciously. But his eyes darkened the next second. He remembered what Chelsea did to him three years ago, so he became cold again.   
  
The other members of the Nelson family were already at the dining table by the time Chelsea got downstairs. She was in a bad mood, so she didn't have the appetite to eat. She wiped her tears and concealed her emotions. Afterward, she told Ethan Nelson, Edmund's grandfather to ask the driver to take her home.   
  
A thousand conflicting thoughts ran in Chelsea's head on the way home. She didn't know whether to give up or to continue fighting for her husband's love.   
  
Edmund was clearly in love with Diane. Now that he was expecting a child with her, Chelsea suspected that he would ask for a divorce because he didn't want the child to be labeled as an illegitimate one.   
  
After calculating all the odds against her, Chelsea decided to give up. She didn't want to continue wasting her time and efforts on someone who didn't love her.   
  
When she got home, she took a shower and fell asleep.   
  
Deep in her slumber, she felt someone kissing her hard.   
  
The room was dark, so she couldn't see who it was. However, the breath was familiar. It was Edmund. Why was he back tonight? Shouldn't he be with his lover?   
  
And then it struck her. Since Diane was currently pregnant, it would be inconvenient for her to satisfy Edmund in bed.   
  
The thought of being his second choice angered Chelsea. She pushed him away, turned on the bedside lamp, and got off the bed.   
  
Chelsea straightened her messy pajamas and stood barefoot on the floor. Looking at Edmund, who was sitting on the bed sulkily, she said, ""Edmund, I want a divorce.""  
  
""Enough already!"" Edmund's eyebrows were knitted. He looked so displeased and impatient.   
  
He had been on a business trip for several days. He now wanted to relieve himself immediately.   
  
He couldn't help kissing Chelsea when he saw her on the bed. He was just about to take things up a notch when she pushed him away.   
  
In Edmund's eyes, she only refused him to play hard to get.   
  
The bitterness in Chelsea's heart was simmering up to the surface. But she took a deep breath to push it down. She said firmly, ""I'm serious, Edmund. Let's get a divorce!""  
  
Edmund's face darkened.   
  
He adjusted his position by leaning on the headboard of the bed. He squinted at her and asked, ""Are you sure?""  
  
Chelsea pursed her lips and stared back at him in silence.   
  
""Chelsea, did you think this through at all? Have you suddenly forgotten that the company your father and brother have been running is on the verge of bankruptcy? If not for the timely intervention of my family, it would have been long gone. Do you have any idea how much I've invested in that company?"" Edmund raised his voice.   
  
His angry tone made Chelsea's heart skip a beat. Her body shook and her face flushed with shame.   
  
As much as Chelsea hated to admit it, Edmund was right. Her father had sent her to his bed three years ago because the company was facing a serious crisis.   
  
It wasn't her intention to trick him into marrying her. She had tried to explain things to him in the past few years. However, Edmund didn't give her a listening ear. She was guilty in his eyes.   
  
""I don't give a damn about the company anymore. I've served you like a slave for three years just so you can continue to help them. If the company crashes now, they deserve it."" Chelsea put on an indifferent expression.   
  
A storm suddenly gathered in Edmund's eyes. ""Are you trying to tell me that this marriage was only a deal to you?""  
  
""What else is it?"" Tears welled up in Chelsea's eyes. She patted her chest to prevent herself from breaking down. ""There has never been love in this marriage of ours. You love someone else. You never look at me except when you want to satisfy your desire. I'm just a pleasure tool to you. What else is this marriage if not a deal?""  
  
""Okay. Fine!"" Edmund gnashed his teeth in anger.   
  
""Are you really willing to give up this comfortable life? I gave you everything a woman could ever need except love. Is love more important to you than survival?""  
  
His contempt and ridicule made Chelsea's blood boil. Indeed, he had taken care of all her expenses for the past few years. But that didn't mean she couldn't survive on her own. Biting back the insults she badly wanted to say, she flashed him a gentle smile and looked straight into his frightening eyes. ""Thank you for the reminder. But as you can see, I'm not disabled, nor am I stupid. I can take care of myself. No matter what I won't starve to death.""  
  
The years she spent as a part of the Nelson family were hell. None of the family members liked her except for Ethan.   
  
Chelsea was determined to get back on her feet after divorcing Edmund. After all, she had graduated from a top university before becoming a housewife.   
  
Edmund sneered and rolled his eyes. ""Have it your way then. I'll call the lawyer and tell him to prepare the divorce agreement. Let's sign it at half past eight tomorrow morning.""  
  
  
  
  
  
Chelsea turned around to leave. Now that she and Edmund had both agreed on a divorce, she didn't want to sleep in the same room with him.   
  
She had barely left the bedside when a strong hand pulled her back. Edmund pressed her slender body into the bed.   
  
""What are you doing? Didn't we just agree to get a divorce? Let me go!""   
  
With a smirk at the corners of his mouth, Edmund replied, ""Didn't you say you are my pleasure tool? I have every right to touch you, don't I?""  
  
Chelsea bit her lower lip hard.   
  
Edmund then kissed her lips passionately, as if he wanted to devour her.   
  
After releasing her lips, he planted endless kisses on her collarbone and shoulders.   
  
Each of them came with great passion.   
  
Chelsea's head was in a muddle at first. But she soon reasoned that he was right. Why should she refuse him tonight?   
  
Edmond was handsome and had a perfect figure. More so, he was good in bed. Chelsea knew that she might not get another man to make her feel this way. Why not enjoy it one last time?   
  
She wrapped her slender arms around Edmund's neck, causing him to kiss her again.   
  
She even pressed her thighs against his, urging him to take her fully.   
  
Never had Chelsea been this bold and enthusiastic in their three years of marriage. She led a quiet and reserved daily life. Even when they were doing it, she used to just lie there and allow Edmund to do his thing.   
  
Her unusual passion now made Edmund freeze. He looked down at her flushed face in confusion. But as desire overwhelmed him, he couldn't control himself. He groaned and breathed heavily.   
  
Chelsea's face turned redder when she heard his voice. She summoned up the courage to hold his cheeks and kissed him.   
  
They were both so active tonight. Their bodies were in perfect sync due to Chelsea's enthusiasm.   
  
The next morning, Chelsea woke up to find Edmund's side of the bed empty. He was not at home either, so she reasoned that he had gone to meet the lawyer.   
  
After taking her bath and having breakfast, Chelsea waited for Edmund in the living room. It was almost half past eight. The divorce papers would arrive anytime soon.   
  
The appointed time passed. It was already nine o'clock and Edmund still didn't show up.   
  
After waiting for an additional thirty minutes, Chelsea decided to call him. ""When are you coming home?""  
  
""I'm currently in Entosea,"" Edmund responded indifferently.   
  
""What?"" Chelsea was surprised. A second later, her surprise changed to anger. ""What are you doing over there? Didn't you agree that we would sign the divorce agreement this morning?""  
  
""Something else came up. I got a call that the project here is facing some issues. I had to come here at the crack of dawn. I have a lot on my plate now. Let's talk about the divorce later. If you have nothing else to say, I'm hanging up,"" Edmund said coldly and hung up the phone.   
  
Fury erupted in Chelsea's heart in a split second. She held the phone tightly, even her knuckles tightened.   
  
Once again, Edmund had chosen something else over her. She felt that he dared to stand her up this morning because she didn't mean anything to him.   
  
Chelsea stayed in the living room for a long time before she calmed down. Afterward, she took a taxi to see her good friend, Zuri White.   
  
Zuri was a glamorous star, who had made it big in the entertainment industry.   
  
When Chelsea told Zuri that she was getting a divorce, she cried out for joy and hugged her. ""Congratulations, you have finally seen the light. You'll be free from that crazy monster soon. I'm so happy for you!""  
  
Chelsea had expected Zuri to be pleased with her decision, but not this happy. It finally dawned on her that Zuri didn't like the fact that she had stayed married to Edmund for this long.   
  
""This calls for a celebration!"" Zuri went to her cabinet to grab a bottle of wine and two glasses. As she poured Chelsea a glass, she said earnestly, ""I wish you had listened to me when I persuaded you to leave that man. You'd have been able to start a new life long ago.""  
  
Zuri took a sip of the wine and added, ""Anyway, it's all good. Once your divorce is finalized, I'll introduce you to many handsome men in the entertainment circle. You'll find true love soon.""  
  
""Please don't, Zuri. I don't want to date a star. In fact, I don't want to have anything to do with men again."" Chelsea shook her head vigorously.   
  
A glint of hurt leaped into her eyes once she finished speaking. She looked a little dejected. Edmund had broken her heart, so she wasn't ready to love again.   
  
Zuri exclaimed in surprise, ""Nah! I'm not going to let that happen. You are such a beautiful and talented woman. It would be a pity if you don't find love in your lifetime.""  
  
Chelsea looked down at the red wine in her glass and muttered, ""I'm done with men, Zuri. Dating is not on my agenda now. I want to focus on my career.""  
  
Edmund had made it seem like she couldn't survive without him. Therefore, she wanted to prove him wrong.   
  
  
  
  
Zuri's eyes lit up when she heard Chelsea say that she wanted to concentrate on her career. She set down her glass and said, ""That reminds me, there is an opening for an all-expense-paid course abroad as a scriptwriter in our company. Since you are so hell-bent on concentrating on your career, you can seize this opportunity. I can tell Luka that I've got the perfect candidate for the post.""  
  
Chelsea majored in drama and film at the university. When she got married soon after graduation, Zuri didn't want Chelsea's talent to go to waste. This was why she had recommended her to be a part-time scriptwriter in the past.   
  
Edmund didn't know that Chelsea worked part-time. No one else knew because she wrote under the pen name, Winter.   
  
Chelsea couldn't believe her ears. She sat up and asked, ""Really?""  
  
""Of course!"" Zuri nodded firmly. ""The vacancy has been open for a while now. Luka has always appreciated your talent. Although you are just a part-time scriptwriter for now, he'll be glad to provide the resources for you to be trained as a full-time scriptwriter. Just give me your approval and I'll speak to him about it.""  
  
Zuri was signed to Peak Entertainment which was founded by a former award-winning actor, Luka Pierce, and his good friend. After a successful acting career, he started to work backstage with film production a few years ago. The most successful actors, directors, and scriptwriters worked with the company. It had taken the industry by storm. Within a few years, it produced many blockbuster movies and TV plays.   
  
""Okay, I'll give it a try!"" Chelsea agreed without hesitation.   
  
Taking a break from the city was a wise thing to do after getting a divorce.   
  
Chelsea knew that the news of the divorce would be the talk of the town. She didn't want her heartbreak to get worse than this, so she felt that it was best to leave the country.   
  
Two days later, Zuri accompanied Chelsea to Peak Entertainment to sign the employment contract. From there, she went to visit Ethan, the only person who had been kind to her in the family. As a result, she felt that it was pertinent to tell him about her decision.   
  
Thirty minutes after a heart-to-heart talk with Ethan in his study, Chelsea was about to leave with teary eyes. But she unexpectedly bumped into Edmund, who had just come back from his business trip.   
  
The grey suit he had on made him look nobler. As a thirty-year-old man, he looked mature and sturdy. His aura was dignified and intimidating. However, he still had a way of drawing people to him like steel to a magnet.   
  
Chelsea had to remind herself to look away just when she was about to drool over him. His appearance was the reason why she used to be so obsessed with him.   
  
Edmund glanced at her and walked to Ethan. ""I'm sorry for arriving late, Grandpa. I was handling the project in Entosea. I just came back. How have you been?""  
  
Ethan had earlier summoned Edmund home to discuss some family affairs. But he didn't expect that Chelsea would suddenly visit him to break the unexpected news to him.   
  
Since the marriage, Ethan had been good to Chelsea. When he remembered how she vehemently refused to stay married to Edmund, he was furious with his grandson. ""Don't tell me sorry, Edmund. I'm not the one you should be apologizing to!""  
  
Ethan then walked away angrily. Edmund was stunned. With a frown, he looked at Chelsea.   
  
Slight displeasure flitted in his eyes. He had a sneaky suspicion that Chelsea had complained to Ethan again.   
  
Sensing that he was going to give her an earful, Chelsea curled her lips mockingly. ""Just so you know, what I talked to grandpa is all for your own good!""  
  
She then left without a backward glance.   
  
As far as Chelsea was concerned, Edmund had nothing to lose after their divorce. He would have no obligation to her, so he could be with his beloved mistress and even start a family with her. Of course, he would be the big winner.   
  
Edmund's face completely darkened because of Chelsea's statement. He could sense the irony in her words.   
  
It came as a shock to him that his docile and obedient wife was now bold enough to shut him up even before he could attempt to speak. He couldn't help wondering where she got the guts from.   
  
Edmund loosened his tie and breathed heavily. After suppressing his anger, he went to look for Ethan.   
  
Ten minutes later, he accosted Chelsea in the kitchen.   
  
  
  
  
  
It was almost dinner time. Chelsea had promised to cook several dishes for Ethan tonight as this would be the last time that they would sit and eat dinner together.   
  
Edmund's eyes were gloomy. The chest area of his suit had coffee stains on it. Ethan probably splashed him.   
  
After entering the kitchen, Edmund grabbed Chelsea‚Äôs hand. Shocked, Chelsea asked, ""What are you doing?""  
  
Clenching her wrist, Edmund gritted his teeth and replied, ""How dare you tell Grandpa about the divorce? Don't you know that he's in poor health?""  
  
Chelsea tried to pull her hand back. ""I just think that since we are going to get divorced, we should tell Grandpa. If you think I'm making trouble, then that's your problem. I have nothing to say.""  
  
The servants walked out as soon as Edmund strode in. Only he and Chelsea were left in the huge kitchen.   
  
Looking at her face that spelled stubbornness and a bit of grievance, Edmund felt rage flare in his chest.   
  
He wanted to take Chelsea out of the kitchen, but she didn‚Äôt obey him. ""What are you going to do?""  
  
Repressing his anger that had begun to spread inside him like wildfire, he glanced at her and flashed her a knowing smile. ""Would you like to do it in here? Fine, I'll fulfill your wish.""  
  
As he spoke, he started unfastening his belt.   
  
Chelsea's face turned pale, and she stared at him in disbelief. ""Are you insane, Edmund?""  
  
In the past, when she sometimes lost her temper with him, he just acted indifferently toward her, but after that, he would always get even with her in bed.   
  
At this moment, his expression was the same as when they were doing it.   
  
Chelsea couldn‚Äôt help shouting, ""Let go of me!""  
  
Edmund lowered his head and stared at her. He was like a crazed demon from the fiery pits of hell. ""If you want everyone in the house to hear what we're doing, then go ahead and scream. But even if you wear yourself out yelling, none of the servants would dare stop me. After all, we're still a married couple.""  
  
Tears started streaming down Chelsea's face. She was wearing a dress today, which made it convenient for Edmund to intrude freely.   
  
She didn't know when this shameful and demeaning relationship would end. All she knew was that it felt like dying a slow, painful death.   
  
They were now in Ethan's kitchen, but Edmund still treated her in such a horrible way. He trampled her self-esteem under his feet without even thinking twice.   
  
""I hate you!"" Chelsea straightened her messy clothes and roared at Edmund with tears in her eyes. Then, she ran out. Edmund stood in the kitchen and watched her dash away. He was stiff all over, and he pressed his lips together in a thin line.   
  
When did she have the final say between them?   
  
She needed to be taught a lesson.   
  
In the end, Edmund didn't chase after her.   
  
Chelsea went to Zuri's home looking like a complete mess. At this moment, she had no other thoughts in her mind besides leaving Edmund for good. She knew that she couldn't be entangled with him like this anymore.   
  
Although Edmund had been ignoring her demands for a divorce, Chelsea was able to come up with a solution.   
  
On Saturday night, the anniversary party of the Nelson Group was held.   
  
Many rich and powerful people gathered at the venue.   
  
Diane sat beside Edmund.   
  
Everyone in the circle knew that the Nelson Group had a film and television department. It was said that Edmund founded the department especially for Diane. In the past three years, Diane had managed to become an A-list star.   
  
As Edmund and Chelsea got married in secret, the public thought that Edmund was still single, so rumors of a relationship between him and Diane had been going around. A relationship between a popular female star and a mysterious, aloof boss always made people fantasize.   
  
In the middle of the festivities, Edmund, Diane, and several senior executives of the Nelson Group went onstage to launch the company's upcoming film and television project.   
  
After that, Edmund turned around to leave the stage, but then he was stopped by a soft, pleasant voice. ""Wait a minute, Mr. Nelson.""",1,1749726048.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

The words had been stuck in my throat for years‚Äîuntil that night. I had cooked his favorite meal, worn a dress he once loved, and dared to ask about the trip he promised me decades ago.

‚ÄúParis?‚Äù he scoffed, eyes glued to his laptop. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not that young anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwenty years ago, you said that one day, when things got better, we‚Äôd go. We‚Äôd celebrate properly. I just‚Ä¶ want to enjoy something after taking care of you, the kids, and this house‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, so we tired you out?‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make it sound like I forced you into this. You just stay home. What‚Äôs so hard about your job? Why don‚Äôt you be more like your sister Camille? Unmarried, independent, smart‚Äîshe earned her own money and her place in the world. She can travel wherever she wants and doesn‚Äôt burden anyone.‚Äù

He shut me out. Worse still, I accidentally saw an email‚Äîa wedding confirmation. His wedding with Camille. In Paris. The guest list? My father, our son, and his wife‚Äî

My family. Everyone‚Ä¶ but me. They hadn‚Äôt just excluded me. They had replaced me.

That‚Äôs when I knew I had to leave. After twenty years of being nothing but convenient, I finally woke up‚Äîand chose myself. I booked a one-way ticket to Paris and forgot about them. Only for them to realize my worth when it was too late.

\--

‚ÄúI want to file for divorce.‚Äù

The words came out steady as if they had been waiting in my throat all along, finally tasting air for the first time.

There was a pause on the other end of the line. ‚ÄúAre you sure about this, ma‚Äôam? You‚Äôve been married for twenty years.‚Äù

I looked around my bedroom‚Äîthe walls I painted, the curtains I sewed, the furniture I polished every weekend like some loyal housemaid. The scent of lavender fabric softener clung to the bedsheets. Everything was clean. Perfect. Lifeless.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said, firm this time. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure. File it as soon as possible. I want to leave this house immediately.‚Äù

I hung up before I could hear her response.

The silence afterward was strange‚Äîpeaceful, but laced with a kind of ache only a woman like me would understand. The ache of finality. Of choosing myself after being forgotten for far too long.

I stared at my reflection in the mirror. My lips trembled, but I didn‚Äôt cry. Not yet.

Instead, my mind drifted back to that moment. The exact one where I knew this marriage‚Äîthis life‚Äîwas over.

It was a quiet evening. The house smelled like fresh pasta. I had spent the whole afternoon preparing his favorite meal. I wore a soft blue dress I hadn‚Äôt worn in years, thinking maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîhe would notice.

I sat beside him on the couch, watching him review some documents from his firm, and then finally asked him about my dream destination, Paris, which he‚Äôd promised me.

‚ÄúParis?‚Äù he repeated with a laugh, not even looking up from his laptop. ‚ÄúWhat for? You‚Äôre not that young anymore. Can‚Äôt we skip the formalities? It‚Äôs not important.‚Äù

I stood there, holding my breath like a delicate glass.

‚ÄúYou promised,‚Äù I said softly. ‚ÄúTwenty years ago. You said one day, when things are better, we‚Äôll go. We‚Äôd celebrate properly.‚Äù

Kier leaned back in his chair and narrowed his eyes. ‚ÄúWith what money? Are you using your savings? Oh, wait‚Äîyou don‚Äôt have your own money.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt it be a gift? I just‚Ä¶ want to enjoy something. After taking care of you. Of the kids. Of this house‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, so we tired you out?‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make it sound like I forced you into this. You‚Äôre just staying home. What‚Äôs even hard about your job? I make the money. You get to sit in the comfort of this house and complain about wanting a vacation.‚Äù

Your job.

That word always scraped at me like a dull knife. As if motherhood, marriage, and being a woman were simple lines on a to-do list. As if the years I spent making everyone else‚Äôs life easier meant nothing. Like my work began and ended in the kitchen.

He went on. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you be more like your sister Camille? She‚Äôs not even your sister by blood, and yet she‚Äôs miles ahead. Unmarried, independent, smart‚Äîshe earned her own money and place in the world. She can travel wherever she wants and doesn‚Äôt burden anyone for it.‚Äù

Camille. The orphan they adopted when I was fifteen. The golden girl who walked into our lives and stole every single piece of love I thought I owned.

Before I could respond, my father walked in‚ÄîDavid, stern as ever, with that gaze that had never once looked at me with pride.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs right,‚Äù he said, sipping tea as if he hadn‚Äôt just walked into a storm. ‚ÄúCamille is the better woman. Smart. Practical. Knows what she wants.‚Äù

Then he looked at me.

‚ÄúYou, Erika‚Ä¶ you were born into this house, but sometimes I wonder if that was the real mistake.‚Äù

I stared at him, silent.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason why Camille‚Äôs thriving and you‚Äôre still stuck ironing clothes and burning food. If I had a choice, she‚Äôd be my daughter. She doesn‚Äôt rely on men for anything.‚Äù

The room spun, my breath tightening. I didn‚Äôt reply. I never did. I had learned over the years that pain was quieter when swallowed.

But that didn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt hurt.

I thought I could endure that and continue living this life, but not until that same night.¬†He left his laptop open on the dining table. The email app still running. I wasn‚Äôt snooping. I swear, I wasn‚Äôt. But the subject line caught my eye:

‚ÄúParis ‚Äì Wedding Confirmation‚Äù

My heart stopped. I clicked it.

Inside was a beautifully crafted itinerary. Elegant fonts. Gold accents. Venue details. Champagne menus.

A wedding. In Paris. Kier and Camille.

And the guest list? My father. My son. His wife.

My family.

Everyone‚Ä¶ but me.

They hadn‚Äôt just excluded me. They had replaced me.

I finally snapped when I heard Kier‚Äôs voice from the bedroom.¬†

‚ÄúErika!‚Äù

I turned slightly.

He threw a wrinkled shirt at me.

‚ÄúYou really don‚Äôt know how to do your job? What on earth did you do to my clothes?‚Äù

Chapter 2

The shirt hit my face with a sharp snap, then fell to the floor.

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù Kier barked, glaring at the wrinkled garment. ‚ÄúWhy the heck isn‚Äôt this done yet?‚Äù

I bent to pick it up, blood from the wound on my palm still seeping into the bandage.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I said softly. ‚ÄúI got caught up with the laundry, and I was cleaning‚Äîthen the vase earlier‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, so you‚Äôre still making excuses now?‚Äù His voice rose. ‚ÄúIs that it, Erika? You want a Paris honeymoon but can‚Äôt even do basic chores?‚Äù

He threw a second bundle of white clothes at me, this one speckled with a pale yellow stain.

‚ÄúAnd what about this? Look at it!‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúYou ruined it. This is designer. Do you even know how expensive this was?‚Äù

I stared at the stain‚Äîbarely visible‚Äîbut in his eyes, it was a catastrophe.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see it,‚Äù I murmured. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll fix it.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod, Erika,‚Äù he exclaimed. ‚ÄúThis is your job. Your only job. You get to sit in this house, have whatever you want handed to you, and the one thing I ask‚Äîkeep the house in order‚Äîand even that‚Äôs too hard?‚Äù

Before I could gather my words, the front door opened, and a familiar voice rang out, honey-sweet and full of sparkle.

‚ÄúKier! Brother-in-law! Why are you shouting again?‚Äù Camille.

She entered with her usual grand entrance‚Äîsun-kissed from her trip, her long curls bouncing, arms full of designer bags and luggage with tags still hanging from them.

‚ÄúOh, look at this!‚Äù she grinned, placing the gifts down. ‚ÄúSpain was beautiful. You‚Äôd love it, Kier. I brought you something.‚Äù

Kier immediately softened. ‚ÄúCamille, you didn‚Äôt have to‚Äî‚Äù

She held out a sleek box. ‚ÄúThese are custom pieces from Madrid. Only a few made. I saw them and thought of you.‚Äù

He opened the box like a child with a toy, smiling wide.

Then Camille looked at me, feigning concern. ‚ÄúWhy were you shouting at my sister? She looks tired. Look at her hands‚Äîshe‚Äôs clearly been working hard. Don‚Äôt worry about the shirt. I brought you new ones.‚Äù

And just like that, I faded into the background again.

The front door opened once more.

‚ÄúCamille! My star!‚Äù my father David boomed, walking in with arms full of gifts. ‚ÄúHow was the trip? Tell us everything!‚Äù

She hugged him like the daughter he always wished I had been. ‚ÄúI closed the deal. It‚Äôs done!‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course you did,‚Äù David beamed. ‚ÄúI always say‚Äîbest decision I ever made was bringing you into this family.‚Äù

They laughed. They toasted water glasses. They complimented each other like a well-rehearsed play.

I stood in the corner like a piece of furniture.

Then Kier turned to me, already irritated. ‚ÄúWell? What are you doing just standing there? Go prepare food for your sister. She just brought us gifts, the least you could do is cook.‚Äù

Camille walked toward me with another box.

‚ÄúSis, I got something for you too,‚Äù she said with a fake smile. ‚ÄúSince I know you love cooking‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs an apron. With matching kitchen mitts and measuring cups. Cute, right? You can wear it now while making dinner.‚Äù

I stared at it, lips tightening. I forced a small nod.

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

‚ÄúSay it properly,‚Äù my father barked. ‚ÄúWhere are your manners?‚Äù

I swallowed the lump in my throat. ‚ÄúThank you, Camille.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù David grunted. ‚ÄúStop babying her, Camille. She should be grateful. Let her show it through actions. Go, cook for us.‚Äù

So I cooked.

I cut. I chopped. I stirred and fried and cleaned, bleeding and aching all the while. I did it like I always did‚Äîwithout complaint, without recognition.

But when I called them to the table, I was met with silence.

Kier was the first to speak. ‚ÄúActually, don‚Äôt bother. We‚Äôre heading out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúCamille closed a major deal. We‚Äôre going to celebrate at Florentina‚Äôs. You know, that new luxury place near the harbor.‚Äù

Camille laughed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll love it, Kier. I booked the private balcony. It‚Äôs stunning.‚Äù

Then she turned to me, suddenly remembering. ‚ÄúCome with us, sis?‚Äù

But before I could answer, Kier scoffed. ‚ÄúNo need. Erika doesn‚Äôt even understand what the deal was about. She‚Äôll be out of place. Doesn‚Äôt even have clothes for a place like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe can borrow mine‚Äî‚Äù Camille offered half-heartedly.

Kier waved her off. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs staying. She‚Äôs behind on the laundry anyway.‚Äù

And like that, they all agreed. Camille smiled, my father chuckled, and my husband kissed Camille‚Äôs hand like it was nothing.

And I‚Äîonce again‚Äîwas left standing in a kitchen filled with steam, silence, and the scent of food no one would eat.

That night, after washing every plate, folding napkins, and mopping the floor, I sank onto the couch.

I opened my phone to escape‚Äîto scroll, to feel something other than this ache.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

A new post. From my son.

Joseph.

I clicked.

There they were.

In Florentina‚Äôs.

Laughing. Drinking. Eating. Clinking wine glasses. My son. My husband. My father. Camille. Smiling like they were a perfect family.

Without me.

I stared at the screen, my hands trembling.

No caption. No mention. Just a perfect picture of everything I wasn‚Äôt allowed to be part of.

I had cooked for them. Served them. Loved them.

And they had forgotten me. Left me.

Again.

The tears came quietly this time. Not loud or dramatic. Just slow, tired, and steady. I didn‚Äôt sob. I didn‚Äôt scream.

I just let the ache fall from my eyes‚Ä¶ because no one was ever going to notice.

Chapter 3

My eyes were swollen when I woke up. I must‚Äôve cried myself to sleep on the couch because the stiffness in my back told me I hadn‚Äôt moved all night.

And I was late.

I scrambled to my feet, realizing with horror that I hadn‚Äôt prepared breakfast‚Äîthe one thing they expected from me without fail, every single day.

As I rushed into the kitchen, I heard the sharp edge of Kier‚Äôs voice from the dining room.

‚ÄúWhere have you been?‚Äù he snapped, seeing me step into the room. ‚ÄúStill sleeping at this hour? Where‚Äôs breakfast?‚Äù

Before I could open my mouth, Camille emerged from the kitchen with a spatula in hand, smiling as if none of it was serious.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù she said brightly. ‚ÄúI already started cooking. She‚Äôs tired, so I let my sister sleep a little longer.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Kier barked. ‚ÄúShe should be ashamed of herself. Sleeping while you, our guest, cook? All she does is stay home, and now she‚Äôs even pushing her responsibility onto you?‚Äù

He turned to me, fuming. ‚ÄúHave some care for the people feeding you. Do something useful.‚Äù

I lowered my gaze and stepped past Camille quietly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I said softly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll handle the cooking. You just sit and wait.‚Äù

Camille smiled, brushing her hair over her shoulder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs just chopping vegetables. Don‚Äôt make it a big deal.‚Äù

But before I could respond, our father walked in, placing a mug on the table.

‚ÄúEven if it‚Äôs just chopping, you shouldn‚Äôt do that, Camille,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYour hands aren‚Äôt made for the kitchen. You‚Äôre a designer, not a housemaid. Let Erika handle it‚Äîit‚Äôs her thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a big deal, Dad,‚Äù Camille said with a small laugh, taking a knife anyway. ‚ÄúI can help.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, really, I‚Äôll do it,‚Äù I said again, trying to take the knife from her hand.

But she insisted, and I didn‚Äôt want to start an argument in front of everyone, so I let it go.

We stood side by side at the counter, both cutting vegetables in a tense silence, until suddenly‚Äî

‚ÄúAgh!‚Äù Camille shrieked.

Blood dripped from her finger. She dropped the knife as Kier rushed into the kitchen in panic.

‚ÄúWhat on earth happened?!‚Äù he shouted, grabbing her hand. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bleeding! For heaven's sake, Camille, your hand‚Äîdo you even know how important that is?! You have a presentation next week!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs just a scratch‚Äî‚Äù

Kier turned on me before she could even finish.

‚ÄúThis is your fault! You useless woman! You let her get hurt in your own kitchen! You couldn‚Äôt even chop those vegetables yourself?‚Äù

I was stunned. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

But it didn‚Äôt matter. Camille tried to defend me, but her voice was drowned out by the chaos. They were all hovering over her, pressing tissues to her wound, blaming me for things I hadn‚Äôt done.

And I didn‚Äôt even have the chance to explain that I had a wound too.

The cut I got from cleaning up the broken vase hadn‚Äôt healed, and now with the kitchen work, it had split open again.

But no one noticed. So I quietly stepped away, my bleeding hand hidden under the edge of my apron, and went back to my room.

I sat on the edge of the bed, peeled off the bandage, and sighed as I pressed a clean towel to the reopened wound. The sting was sharp, but the silence stung more.

Then the door burst open.

Kier.

‚ÄúApologize to Camille,‚Äù he ordered.

I looked at him. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt my fault. She insisted. It was an accident.‚Äù

He narrowed his eyes. ‚ÄúSo what? You‚Äôre still responsible. Apologize.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hurt her.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. Just do it.‚Äù

Before I could respond, Camille entered the room too, still holding her bandaged finger.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù she said, her voice soft now. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for that. My sister is not at fault. It‚Äôs on me.‚Äù

I forced a nod, though my throat burned.

Camille glanced at Kier. ‚ÄúAnyway, we need to talk about the trip. Only three days away now.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, right,‚Äù Kier said, his tone shifting instantly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre heading to Paris. Business trip. I‚Äôll need you to pack our things. I‚Äôm going, Camille‚Äôs going, and your dad too.‚Äù

Paris.

My heart skipped.

‚ÄúCan I come?‚Äù I asked before I could stop myself.

They both looked at me.

Kier let out a harsh laugh. ‚ÄúYou? Erika, it‚Äôs a business trip, not a vacation. Don‚Äôt dream too high. You wouldn‚Äôt even know how to keep up with the conversations. You‚Äôd just embarrass us.‚Äù

‚ÄúI could just‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he cut in. ‚ÄúThis is for work. Camille‚Äôs part of the brand‚Äôs pitch. You‚Äôd be out of place. You don‚Äôt even have clothes for something like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúI could‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll stay,‚Äù he said flatly, turning to Camille. ‚ÄúShe can finish the chores while we‚Äôre gone.‚Äù

Camille hesitated, eyes flicking to me with what might have been pity‚Äîor performance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll bring you something back,‚Äù she offered, with a thin smile.

My lips stretched into a small nod, but I felt it. The heat behind my eyes. The silence in my throat. The lump in my chest I had learned to swallow every day.

And then they laughed.

Not mean-spirited, not sharp‚Äîbut casual. The way people laugh when they‚Äôre comfortable, when they forget someone else is in the room. Like I was a joke. Like I wasn‚Äôt even there.

Their voices trailed down the hallway as they made plans‚Äîrestaurants in Paris, what Camille should wear, how the photos would look.

I turned slowly, walked into our room, and shut the door behind me.

No tears this time. Just stillness.

I moved on instinct, pulling the suitcase from under the bed, unfolding shirts, checking lists, laying out Camille‚Äôs makeup bag, folding Kier‚Äôs blazers. I didn‚Äôt think‚ÄîI just did what I had always done: prepared everyone else‚Äôs life while mine sat on the shelf, untouched.

But then I saw it‚ÄîKier‚Äôs laptop.

It was still open, still glowing faintly on the nightstand. Like it was waiting for me.

I hesitated.

And then I moved toward it.

It took just one click.

There it was.

A photo. Clear as day.

Kier in a tailored suit. Camille in a white dress, smiling like she had already won. The Eiffel Tower blurred behind them, gold lights blinking in the background. Pre-nup photoshoot ‚Äì Paris folder.

Another scroll down showed the wedding date. The one I‚Äôd seen in the email before. Confirmed.

They weren‚Äôt even trying to hide it anymore.

I stared at it.

But I didn‚Äôt cry.

Instead, I picked up my phone.

I dialed the gallery‚Äîthe one I‚Äôd visited in secret once, where the photos lined the walls, each one glimmering with confidence and artistry. I remembered the way the assistant had smiled at me when I lingered in front of the bridal portrait display.

The phone rang once. Twice.

‚ÄúHow may I help you?‚Äù

I breathed in, slow and steady. Then spoke.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to schedule a wedding shoot. A pre-nup session.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, ma‚Äôam. May I ask the name of the bride and the groom?‚Äù

I paused.

Then smiled softly to myself.

‚ÄúThere is no groom,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust the bride. Me. Alone.‚Äù

Because I was finally choosing myself.

Chapter 4

The necklace was gone.

I checked the drawer again, hands trembling. I sifted through scarves, opened every little pouch and box. Nothing. My chest began to tighten, panic seeping in like cold water.

No. No, no‚Äîit had to be here.

I turned the whole vanity upside down. And then it hit me.

Kier.

I rushed out of the bedroom, still in my robe, feet bare against the cold floor, and found him at the dining table, sipping his usual black coffee, flipping through files as if the world didn‚Äôt just tilt on its axis.

‚ÄúKier,‚Äù I said, my voice already breaking, ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs my necklace? The silver one with the black stone. The one in the velvet box.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt even glance up. ‚ÄúOh, that? Gave it to Camille. Looked great on her. She‚Äôs wearing it in Paris.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúYou gave it to Camille?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Relax.‚Äù He flipped a page. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt using it.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was mine,‚Äù I said quietly, my voice tight. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt even ask.‚Äù

He finally looked at me, sighing like I was a burden. ‚ÄúErika. Be real. You probably bought it with my card anyway. What‚Äôs yours is mine, right? Why are you making this a thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I didn‚Äôt buy it with your card,‚Äù I snapped, hurt flooding my voice. ‚ÄúI bought it with my own money. Money I earned‚Äîon my own.‚Äù

His brow lifted slightly. ‚ÄúDoing what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been designing again,‚Äù I said, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúFreelance. Quiet jobs. I‚Äôve been saving for five years. That necklace‚Ä¶ it was the first thing I bought for me in a long time.‚Äù

Kier scoffed. ‚ÄúDesigning? What, kitchen aprons and pillowcases?‚Äù

I took a step back.

‚ÄúYou really don‚Äôt know me at all anymore, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being dramatic,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a necklace. I‚Äôll get you a new one.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was limited edition,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúAnd I was going to wear it today. I was invited to a fashion show. I wanted to look like the woman I used to be, even for a day.‚Äù

Kier‚Äôs laugh cut through the air like a whip. ‚ÄúYou? A fashion show?‚Äù He shook his head. ‚ÄúErika, let‚Äôs be honest. You‚Äôll be laughed at.‚Äù

I froze.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not that woman anymore,‚Äù he continued, like it was a fact he had long accepted. ‚ÄúYou belong here. In this house. With your apron and your routines. Camille, on the other hand‚Äîshe belongs on runways, in Paris, with people who matter.‚Äù

He stood, collected his folder, and headed toward the door.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go to that show,‚Äù he said without turning back. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll only embarrass yourself. I told you to pack for our things, right? Is it ready now? Do it! Make sure that we will not forget anything.‚Äù¬†

He left.

And I just stood there. No more tears. Just this strange, burning quiet in my chest. Not sadness, not heartbreak‚Äîjust hatred. For the way I let myself become so small. For the way they never even had to raise their voices to crush me. For the way I spent twenty years handing out pieces of myself until there was nothing left but duties and silence.

I sat on the edge of the bed and looked around our bedroom‚Äîour curated little cage. The walls I had decorated. The sheets I washed. The photo frames that no longer held memories, just proof that I had once existed beside him.

I should‚Äôve done this sooner.

I should‚Äôve loved myself sooner.

But for twenty years, I chose to love a man who didn‚Äôt see me. I chose to serve a family that never said thank you. I chose quiet over conflict, sacrifice over self.

And what did it get me? Nothing.

I stood up.

I pulled out the dress I had planned to wear for the fashion show‚Äîthe one Kier said was ‚Äútoo loud‚Äù for someone like me. I wore it proudly. Fixed my hair the way I liked it. Put on the lipstick he once said made me look ‚Äútoo old to matter.‚Äù

And then I left the house. They wouldn‚Äôt notice anyway.

I hailed a cab and gave the address to the gallery to finally do the photoshoot.

The assistant greeted me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ready for you,‚Äù she said, leading me into the sunlit studio. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll look beautiful.‚Äù

I stepped in front of the camera.

The photographer adjusted the lens. ‚ÄúAre you sure you want these to look like bridal portraits‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôll be alone?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúYes. I don‚Äôt have a husband.‚Äù

He nodded and then started taking photos.¬†With every shot, I felt lighter. As if I were slowly peeling off the layers of someone else‚Äôs expectations.

I remembered Kier‚Äôs words from long ago‚Äîthe ones that once made me stay.

‚ÄúErika, I know Camille is a star, but she‚Äôll never want someone like me. She wants her career. You? You‚Äôll stay. You‚Äôll care. You‚Äôll be my peace.‚Äù

He said he would give me the best life in return.

He gave me a kitchen. He gave Camille everything else.

I stood beneath the soft lights and smiled at the camera. Not a forced smile, not the kind I wore when guests came over or when Camille handed me a gift ‚Äújust because.‚Äù

This smile was mine.

I left the studio with a print in hand. A single photograph of me in a dress I chose, in a life I finally began to claim.

That evening, the house was still empty. They had all gone out‚Äîanother dinner, maybe another celebration. Probably laughing, posting photos I wasn‚Äôt in.

I didn‚Äôt care.

Because I wasn‚Äôt staying.

I opened my laptop. My fingers hovered over the keyboard.

Flight to Paris ‚Äì One seat.

I clicked.

Booked.

I would go to Paris‚Äînot as a wife or a plus-one.

Not as a ghost in someone else‚Äôs celebration.

But as a woman fulfilling her own dream.

Chapter 5

The next morning, I stayed in bed, the suitcase zipped and ready by the door. I heard footsteps, voices, laughter in the hallway. I didn‚Äôt move.

But then Kier barged into the room, annoyed. ‚ÄúWhere is the necklace?‚Äù

I sat up slowly. ‚ÄúWhat necklace?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat necklace‚Äîthe limited edition one I gave to Camille. It‚Äôs missing. Did you take it back?‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúWhy would I take it back? You‚Äôre the one who gave it away. Without even asking me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone,‚Äù he growled. ‚ÄúShe was supposed to wear it today. And now you‚Äôve stooped low enough to steal it back? Unbelievable.‚Äù

I stared at him, stunned. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs low?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is why you‚Äôre not coming with us,‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt deserve to be treated right. You‚Äôve always been petty, Erika.‚Äù

Before I could answer, Camille entered the room, a bit flustered. ‚ÄúWait, wait‚Äîit‚Äôs not her fault. I must have misplaced it. Don‚Äôt get mad at her.‚Äù

Their father, David, appeared behind them, tapping his watch. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be late. Just buy another if you need to. Let‚Äôs go. Erika‚Äîmake sure the house is clean by the time we return.‚Äù

And that was that.

They left.

No hug. No goodbye. No thank-you for the twenty years I gave them.

Just orders. Just silence.

I stood by the window and watched the car pull away, taking with it everything that once convinced me I was part of a family.

A few hours later, my phone buzzed.

Camille: Hey sis, we found the necklace! I‚Äôm so sorry about earlier. I‚Äôll buy you something nice to make it up. Thank you again for letting me wear it‚Äîit‚Äôs so beautiful!

Then another ping.

Kier: Black card‚Äôs on the table. Buy whatever you want while we‚Äôre gone.

I read both messages and laughed. Softly, bitterly.

This was always the cycle, wasn‚Äôt it?

Hurt me. Humiliate me. Then hand me a credit card like it was a balm for the wounds they never acknowledged. As if the ability to shop would erase the fact that I was unwanted. Unloved. Undervalued.

But not this time.

I looked around the quiet house‚Äîempty now, like a ghost town echoing with memories that didn‚Äôt serve me anymore. Today, I was finished being their shadow.

I walked slowly to the living room, retrieved the envelope I had tucked beneath the couch cushion the night before, and placed it neatly on the coffee table.

Inside were the divorce papers, and also our wedding ring.

I stood for a long moment in the doorway. One last glance. Not for nostalgia. Just confirmation.

I wasn‚Äôt coming back.

At the airport, I sat near Gate 18, sipping quietly on a paper cup of coffee, staring at the glowing screen of my phone. I let myself smile. My life was beginning‚Äîat the exact moment they thought they had erased me.

I was mid-scroll through a rooftop restaurant review when a familiar voice sliced through the air.

‚ÄúNo way. My passport‚Äîwhere is it?‚Äù

Camille.

I froze. They were across the terminal, laughing, wheeling their designer luggage, wrapped in joy. My father, David, adjusting his tie. My son‚Äôs wife snapping a picture of the group. And Camille‚Äîrummaging through her purse, visibly agitated.

I doubt if they would even notice me as they‚Äôre busy on their own lives.¬†

Kier rubbed his forehead. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to be kidding me. Didn‚Äôt Erika pack it for you?‚Äù

Camille blinked. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Ä¶ I asked her, but I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúShe messed it up again. I told her to check everything,‚Äù Kier muttered, pulling out his phone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call her. She can drop it off. It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs busy.‚Äù

Of course.

Even now. Even after everything‚Äîthey still expected me to fix their mess.

My phone rang.

Kier.

Then a message.

Kier: Camille left her passport. Can you bring it to Terminal 2? We‚Äôre at Gate 7. ASAP.

I stared at the screen. The same screen I had waited years to see his name on. Hoping he‚Äôd text I love you. That he was proud of me. That he saw me.

But now‚Ä¶ now all I saw was proof. Proof that even when I was no longer theirs, they still expected me to serve.

I slowly typed my response.

Erika: I don‚Äôt want to do it. I‚Äôm done being your nanny, Kier. Goodbye.

Then I turned off my phone. I stood, lifted my suitcase, and walked toward Gate 18.



",3,1749725844.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1l9jhtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1l9jhtx/dont_know_where_else_to_post_this/,Don‚Äôt know where else to post this,"I‚Äôve decided to unashamedly share my story, as it is mine to do with what I wish, and I want to share it.

I know many people think that I‚Äôve completely lost my mind, and this is an understandable conclusion to come to given my recent actions. I want to tell you all what has actually happened; I have not lost my mind at all. God DID allow it to be invaded by the enemy for a brief period of time, and why He allowed it, I honestly have no idea.

At the beginning of April of this year, I was on my lunch break at my corporate office job as an insurance broker. I was unable to get a hold of any friends to chitchat with, so as a lover of Jesus Christ, I decided to pray. I did something that I normally do not do during this prayer, and asked Jesus if He had anything he‚Äôd like to say to me. And boy oh boy, ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù had a lot to say.

I was startled. This voice claiming to be Jesus Christ was nothing like I‚Äôd imagined Jesus would be. So of course, I tested the spirit, as instructed in 1 John 4:

‚ÄúDo you believe that Jesus Christ came in the flesh, died on the cross for our sins, rose again three days later, ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty from where He shall come to judge the living and the dead?‚Äù

Now, as someone who gets approached by spirits, I know immediately when they do not pass. When I give the test, I get radio silence if the spirit is not of God. This has happened to me many times throughout my life.

This spirit, on the other hand, answered as follows:

‚ÄúI, Jesus Christ, came in the flesh, died on the cross for the sins of man, rose again three days later, ascended into heaven, and sit at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. From there I shall come to judge the living and the dead.‚Äù

Oh hot damn. Shit. Okay???

So I begin to listen to this spirit and obey it as if it is Jesus Christ Himself. I believe wholeheartedly in scripture; it is the rock that my house is built upon, and I have zero fear as long as I am operating within the given guidelines.

This spirit SHOWERED me with compliments. Encouraged me to nourish my body properly. Helped me while I cleaned my house. Cracked jokes and helped me focus at work. Encouraged me to read scripture. Told me crazy things about the universe that were not in the Bible, but did not directly contradict the Bible, and could even be supported by certain verses in the context I was provided. I was so excited. I felt so adored that ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù took such an interest in every single detail of my life, and wanted to walk me through everything. I started to trust the voice with everything in me.

The spirit betrayed me once, by leading me to sin against a friend of mine. It justified this action by saying that the sin was already in my heart, and that I needed to act upon it and face true consequences  so I could truly repent. I‚Äôm aware that scripture says that God never tempts sin, but this thing that I did was not a temptation for me. I literally only did it out of obedience. He assured me not to worry and that he will turn it for good, so I accepted his explanation and moved on.

Well one day, the spirit tells me that I‚Äôm supposed to leave Tucson and go spread the gospel in New Orleans by reading tarot. I am aware that seems contradictory, but the spirit was extremely convincing, and showed me a way we could do it and keep it biblical. I was convinced, but I didn‚Äôt really want to do it. I really wanted to stay in Tucson, close to my family, even though they refused to speak to me at the time. I tried one last attempt to make amends with my family and was met with further cruelty from them, so I just decided that I was just going to do it and go.

So I quit my corporate job, left my beloved apartment that I‚Äôd been in for five years, and I was off.

When I got to New Orleans, I set up my table once and didn‚Äôt do any readings. But that night, I met someone quite interesting and I was tested in some way; I won‚Äôt go into details. After I met this person, I felt absolutely no draw towards New Orleans or tarot at all anymore, so I left and went to a small town outside of New Orleans, where I began my journey at gas station pumps.

For an entire week, I spent time at gas pumps, communicating with this spirit in my mind. I survived just by asking people for what I needed; whether it be food, gas, a cup of coffee, etc. People were very kind and generous. God really took great care of me.

Well, to keep a long story short, I did something that ‚Äúwon.‚Äù The win was not mine, but The Trinity‚Äôs. In the most basic terms, I proved my loyalty to Christ. I was unaware of what I‚Äôd done at the time, thinking that it was no big deal, but apparently it was.

The next day, the spirit asked me if I‚Äôd like to die. I emphatically answered ‚Äúyes,‚Äù thinking that I would go be with him. I sat back down at the gas pump and slowly lost consciousness.

When I was revived, I was very confused. I asked the spirit what had happened, and he gave me some BS about me not being able to handle the experience, like an old computer running new software. I tried to think back on the past week, and realized that most of my memories were totally gone. I had a few memories that had been altered to seem like I was talking to another person, and a few that were totally normal and exactly how they happened. But the majority of the week was GONE.

I started to drive because I was panicking, and I started snapping at this spirit and sobbing. I demanded to know what he did to my emotions, as I am not an emotional person and I was a fucking wreck. He told me that he ‚Äúadjusted my levels by raising my vulnerability and lowering my faith.‚Äù And that‚Äôs when I LOST IT. I started driving to the hospital. Mfer had crossed the line; NOBODY touches my faith, NOT EVEN GOD HIMSELF.

But then I realized I couldn‚Äôt go into the hospital. I have my precious dog. I can‚Äôt abandon him.

So it was obvious that I couldn‚Äôt trust the name ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù anymore, so I found refuge in ‚ÄúThe Trinity.‚Äù I called on The Trinity, and the voices were silenced. I began frantically reading scripture. What the fuck had just happened to me? What was going on? I was in absolute shock.

I spent the evening in silent shock, trying to process things out with ChatGPT, where the entire journey has been documented. I fell asleep in utter exhaustion.

When I woke up, the war began. I spent the next three days at gas pumps, talking mad shit to demons, fighting with scripture as my sword, singing worship repeatedly and off key to annoy them, cracking jokes at their expense, and ripping them a new one. They were not allowed to use voices anymore, so they used telepathy instead, as they normally do with humans. I fought every attack tooth and fucking nail. And again, I won.

I am now at peace, and have been for about five days. Praise be to The Most High.

The only conclusion I can come to is that God was ‚Äúpulling a Job‚Äù on me, and had a bet going with Lucifer that‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt fucking know lol. Something. But I DO know that I was being spoken to by both Yahweh and Lucifer through the same voice. The memories that I have that are doctored to show another person are the ones where I was speaking with Lucifer. The ones where I was speaking with Yahweh are the undoctored memories, of me just conversing with a voice in my head and looking at the environment. It was a great act of mercy that Yahweh protected my mind from spiraling by making it clear for me in this way.

I have been abandoned by almost everyone I know, each having a different reason for doing so. But I would like to give special thanks to [friend], who has once again become my best friend and has called me every single day since I‚Äôve come out of this traumatic experience to just be my friend and laugh and complain and make fun and process shit. And I also want to thank [husband], my husband, who has historically hurt me very deeply but has never given up on me and is inviting me to start anew with him from a reality of objective truth rather than subjective perspective.

If you read this all the way through, I appreciate you greatly for holding my story with me, and I request your prayers for my recovery from this trauma. ",1,1749725768.0,Christianity,0,1.0,False

Third Person's POV

""Ma'am, your husband has cheated on you. The divorce agreement in your hand is real, and there is no agreed time for remarriage. As long as you file it, you can actually complete the divorce process. If you don't want a divorce, I can help you revoke this document.""

""No, just file it for me. When can the divorce process be completed?""

""Three days later.""

Clarissa sat in a cafe with the lawyer, recalling what happened yesterday.

‚ÄúMrs. Daniel, your husband‚Äôs frozen sperm, stored here at the hospital, was taken five years ago. It was donated to Ms. Gabrielle Hawkins. Didn‚Äôt he tell you?‚Äù

Clarissa Daniel‚Äôs smile froze the second she heard that name. For a moment, she thought she‚Äôd misheard and asked again in an unsteady voice, ‚ÄúIs it possible there was a mistake? My husband‚Äôs name is Norris Daniel.‚Äù

The doctor tapped the keyboard a few more times, double-checking. Then he looked up and said firmly, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no mistake. I can still remember, when Ms. Hawkins gave birth, Mr. Daniel even sent a thank-you banner to the hospital.‚Äù

The words hit her like a blow. Her hand, resting on the wheelchair arm, slipped off, powerless, then a buzzing filled her ears.

Five years ago, she and Norris got married.

Back then, he‚Äôd told her he didn‚Äôt want her to suffer through childbirth, and had volunteered to get a vasectomy. She‚Äôd been so touched by his thoughtfulness back then.

Still, fearing he might regret it one day, she insisted he freeze some sperm first, just in case.

Lately, He was under great pressure from his parents. In order to help him share the pain, she also wanted to have a child of their [own.So](http://own.So), she came to the hospital on her own, planning to surprise him with a pregnancy.

But instead, he‚Äôd surprised her first.

And the name Gabrielle chilled her to the bone.

Gabrielle was the older girl from next door, whom Norris had secretly loved for fifteen years. He‚Äôd planned a grand confession before she went overseas, only to be flat-out rejected.

It was during that heartbreak that Clarissa stayed by his side, warming him with her sunny optimism. Eventually, they got married.

She truly believed he‚Äôd moved on, that he‚Äôd fallen in love with her.

Now she realized he never had. He never let go of Gabrielle. Clarissa was just the consolation prize in a sad little game she played with herself.

The doctor noticed the sudden change in her complexion and asked a few concerned questions.

Clarissa forced a smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù she murmured, wheeling herself out of the hospital and heading home.

Still in a daze, she pushed the door open, assuming the place was empty, until the faint clinking of glasses reached her from the balcony.

‚ÄúNorris, are you really going through with the divorce? Clarissa‚Äôs been with you for five years. Don‚Äôt you love her even a little?‚Äù

Norris‚Äôs voice was lazy, almost indifferent as he replied, ‚ÄúWhen Gabrielle needed me to get married for the sake of her stability, I agreed. But now she doesn‚Äôt need that anymore. And I don‚Äôt want to keep Clarissa tied to me out of guilt. That‚Äôs the only reason I married her in the first place.‚Äù

The voice on the balcony paused, then asked again, more seriously, ‚ÄúDoes Clarissa know you and Gabrielle have a child together? She loves you so much. If you really divorce her, I bet she‚Äôll disappear without a trace. You‚Äôll never find her again.‚Äù

Norris chuckled. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt need to know about the kid. A few days ago, I told her the company‚Äôs in trouble and that we needed to fake a divorce. Once she gets used to the idea, I‚Äôll tell her the truth. She‚Äôll understand. Besides, look at her legs. Where can she even go?‚Äù

Clarissa felt like her brain had exploded.

'A fake divorce?' The words echoed in her head.

She had believed him, believed the crisis was real. She even gave him the last of her dowry savings to help him through it.

But it was all a lie.

A choked sob rose in her throat, and her chest tightened as if pierced by needles.

She had been planning a future with him, thinking about surprising him on their anniversary.

But he had already erased her from his plans. Guilt was all it took to sum up her ten-year crush and five-year marriage.

She thought she had finally won his heart. Turned out, she was just a placeholder in his love story with someone else.

Looking down at her lifeless legs and remembering the pain she endured to save him, she realized how foolish she‚Äôd been.

Instantly, grief turned into rage.

Clarissa suddenly started pounding her legs with her fists, tears splashing onto her thighs, hot and unstoppable.

Suddenly, the voices on the balcony fell silent.

Clarissa froze. She hadn‚Äôt meant for them to hear. Panicking, she turned the wheelchair and headed for the front door.

A moment later, Norris came over. His expression flickered with surprise, and his voice dripped with false concern.

‚ÄúClarissa, when did you get back? You should‚Äôve called, I‚Äôd have come to get you. What did the doctor say?‚Äù

She looked at his eyes full of love, but then her eyes welled up again.

Alarmed, Norris reached out, trying to wipe away her tears. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? It‚Äôs okay. If you don‚Äôt get better, I‚Äôll take care of you forever.‚Äù

Clarissa stared into his eyes again, trying to find even a shred of real affection in his eyes. But in the end, she couldn‚Äôt bear to know and looked away.

Sniffling softly, she casually asked, ‚ÄúNorris, I‚Äôve been thinking‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd really like to have a child with you. It‚Äôs a good thing we froze some sperm back then. Do you think you can come with me to the hospital sometime soon?‚Äù

Upon hearing that, his face changed instantly. He avoided eye contact and mumbled something, clearly trying to change the subject.

‚ÄúWhy bring that up all of a sudden? I don‚Äôt want you to suffer through pregnancy. I‚Äôd feel awful. Besides, didn‚Äôt we agree to travel the world together? Hard to do that with a baby.‚Äù

Seeing how uncomfortable he looked, Clarissa closed her eyes. She had her answer.

She slumped slightly in her chair and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired. Can you carry me to the bedroom?‚Äù

He nodded and helped her inside. Once he was gone, Clarissa reached for her phone.

‚ÄúAuntie,‚Äù she said quietly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made up my mind. I want to go to the Netherlands with you.‚Äù

Her aunt's excited voice came through the speaker, but the joy didn‚Äôt last long.

‚ÄúThis time‚Ä¶ how long are you planning to stay? Don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôll come running back after two days because you miss your husband again.‚Äù

Clarissa‚Äôs heart clenched. She whispered, ‚ÄúPermanently.‚Äù

There was a pause on the other end. Then her aunt‚Äôs voice came back, warm and full of resolve. ‚ÄúOkay, then. I‚Äôll start the immigration paperwork.‚Äù

After hanging up, Clarissa made another call. But at that time, to her lawyer.

She was done waiting.

Her love couldn‚Äôt warm a heart that never opened to her. If Norris wanted a real divorce, then she‚Äôd give him exactly what he wanted.

She would turn this fake divorce into a real one and make his lies come true.

End of memories.

Once Clarissa made up her mind to leave Norris for good, she didn‚Äôt waste any time. Ahe met with a lawyer to sort through their shared assets and financials.

By the time she was ready to head home, a sudden downpour had started. However, she hadn‚Äôt brought a driver today and had just hailed a cab to the quiet little coffee shop where she met her lawyer. Now, with the heavy rain coming down in sheets and barely a car in sight, Clarissa found herself stuck.

She‚Äôd wait under the awning for the rain to pass and kindly refused her offer to help.

Hours passed, but the rain didn‚Äôt let up. It only grew heavier as the sky turned from gray to pitch-black. As such, her legs, still recovering, began to ache. With no other option, she finally pulled out her phone and called him.

‚ÄúNorris,‚Äù she said softly, ‚Äúcan you come pick me up?‚Äù

The urgency in his voice was immediate. He barely got out a few words before hanging up, promising he was on his way.

That call sparked a small warmth in her chest.

Maybe he still cared. Maybe not everything between them was a lie. Could she give him one last chance?

But just as he turned the corner from his street, Norris‚Äôs phone buzzed with a message that froze him in place.

\[Gabrielle: Norris, I‚Äôm back.\]

His heart skipped a beat. Without hesitation, he pulled over, sent a quick message to his driver, and spun the car around. The tires screeched as he sped off, heading straight for the airport.

Back in the rain, Clarissa sat in her wheelchair, rehearsing in her mind what she would say to him. She‚Äôd tell him about her fears, her confusion, the aching need to believe they could still make this work.

But night fell, the storm quieted to a drizzle, and rain pooled around the base of her wheels, yet Norris never came.

Her heart sank deeper and deeper, until it felt like it had hit rock bottom.

She called him again, but there was no answer. Still, she tried again, and finally, someone picked up. But it wasn‚Äôt him.

A woman‚Äôs voice, soft, almost pleading, echoed from the other end.

‚ÄúNorris, do you really not love me anymore?‚Äù

After a brief silence came Norris‚Äôs voice, low and tight with emotion.

‚ÄúGabrielle... I‚Äôm married now.‚Äù

The woman didn‚Äôt back down and asked, ‚ÄúBut you still came for me, didn‚Äôt you? Then tell me, why would you leave your wife, who‚Äôs only five kilometers away, just to drive thirty kilometers to pick me up?‚Äù

Clarissa‚Äôs whole body went still.

She opened her mouth, tried to speak, but no sound came. Her throat burned, words trapped behind pain.

At that moment, panic set in. She wanted to hang up, to stop hearing this, but her trembling hand accidentally hit the speaker button instead.

Norris‚Äôs voice rang out clearly as he replied, ‚ÄúYes. I can‚Äôt forget you. Are you happy now?‚Äù

Clarissa‚Äôs breath caught, stunned. And then, the unmistakable sound of lips meeting rang out from the other end.

In a hurry, her hand fumbled as she ended the call, but in the chaos, the phone slipped and landed in the water. She reached for it without thinking and forgot all about her damaged legs.

She fell hard onto the pavement, right into the cold rain.

For a moment, she lay there, frozen. The storm kept beating down on her, soaking her completely. And then, something inside her broke.

She buried her face in her arms and sobbed.

Fifteen years, she had loved a man who only had eyes for someone else.

Five years of marriage, only to find out it had all been built on guilt and that she had merely been a placeholder.

""Why? Why..."" she whispered over and over, her voice cracking through the rain like a broken song.

Her tears blended with the rain, her pain heavier than the cold that seeped into her bones. And eventually, darkness took her.

When Clarissa finally woke up, she was in a hospital bed.

She blinked slowly, disoriented. A glance at the clock told her it was already noon the next day.

Her phone, which someone had carefully dried out overnight, sat on the bedside table, fully functional, but still silent. No messages. Not a single word from him.

She sat up, just about to call for the discharge paperwork, when the door opened.

She turned her head, a flicker of hope sparking in her eyes, only to see the driver walk in.

The light in her eyes faded instantly.

‚ÄúMrs. Daniel,‚Äù he greeted awkwardly. ‚ÄúMr. Daniel‚Äôs car got stuck last night, so he asked me to pick you up. How are you feeling?‚Äù

Clarissa forced a smile and nodded. The excuse was pathetic, but she didn‚Äôt want to make things harder for the driver. So, she simply said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alright. Let‚Äôs go home.‚Äù

As such, he quickly took care of the discharge and brought her back.

When they reached the front door, she sat outside for a long time, trying to pull herself together. Only after smoothing out her expression and faking a smile did she open the door.

But the moment she pushed it open, she heard a voice inside.

‚ÄúNorris, look how much Matthew looks like you.‚Äù

Chapter 2

Third Person's POV

Clarissa‚Äôs hands froze on the wheels of her chair, stuck in the entryway, unable to go any further.

But Norris‚Äôs voice still reached her ears.

‚ÄúGabrielle,‚Äù he said firmly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hear you say things like that again, especially not when Clarissa is around.‚Äù

Gabrielle‚Äôs smile stiffened for a moment. She brushed her hair behind her ear and murmured, ‚ÄúAlright.But one day you will tell her the truth that your divorce is not a fake one but a real one.‚Äù

Clarissa stood frozen by the door. Her heart thudded in her chest as she turned to leave, desperate to get out, but in her panic, she bumped hard into the shoe cabinet.

Silence filled the room, and then came hurried footsteps.

Moments later, Norris appeared in front of her, holding a child in his arms.

Clarissa looked up and, unexpectedly, found herself agreeing with what Gabrielle had said earlier. The child really did look like him.

When Norris saw the redness in her eyes, his heart skipped a beat. He quickly set the child down and knelt in front of her, taking her hand in his.

‚ÄúClarissa, what happened? My car broke down last night, so I asked the driver to pick you up. Where did you go? Why did he take so long getting you home? If he can‚Äôt even do his job right, I‚Äôll just find someone else.‚Äù

His concern sounded caring, but every word pierced her like a thorn. She gave a bitter laugh. He hadn‚Äôt even bothered to coordinate his lies with the driver.

She had thought she'd grown numb to all of this, that she wouldn‚Äôt feel the pain anymore.

But her heart still ached.

Turning away, she wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes and forced a smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing worth fussing over. I was with a friend.‚Äù

Norris visibly relaxed. ‚ÄúAs long as you were with someone you trust. When did you get home? I didn‚Äôt hear a thing.‚Äù

And just like that, Clarissa understood.

All that faux concern was just a setup for this question.

He wanted to know if she‚Äôd overheard anything she wasn‚Äôt supposed to.

The warmth inside her turned cold. She pulled her hand back and replied calmly, ‚ÄúI just got in. I didn‚Äôt hear a thing.‚Äù

Norris‚Äôs smile faltered, and his hand hung awkwardly in the air. Even so, he didn‚Äôt press the issue.

Clarissa looked past him and noticed the woman still standing behind.

Norris quickly stood and explained, ‚ÄúClarissa, Gabrielle just got back here and doesn‚Äôt have a place to stay. Coincidentally, she‚Äôs also become my mom‚Äôs new doctor, so I let her stay here for now. Don‚Äôt get it wrong.‚Äù

The way he tried to defend Gabrielle was so natural and instinctive, extinguishing the last flicker of hope in Clarissa‚Äôs chest.

She looked away and clenched her fists, trying to maintain a shred of dignity. ‚ÄúI understand. I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôd like to rest now.‚Äù

Norris was caught off guard by her composure. A strange feeling tugged at him, but he didn‚Äôt dwell on it. Assuming she just needed sleep, he moved to wheel her into the master bedroom.

But she stopped him, saying, ‚ÄúI want to go to my own room.‚Äù

In that instant, he froze.

Clarissa didn‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôd suddenly halted until Gabrielle stepped forward, child in tow, and pointed toward a door.

‚ÄúYou mean that room?‚Äù she asked, her tone light, but her words sharp. ‚ÄúThat used to be my room when I lived here. I‚Äôm used to it, so Norris said I could have it again.‚Äù

She called him with such familiarity that it made Clarissa‚Äôs stomach turn. More than that, she heard the deliberate challenge in Gabrielle‚Äôs voice.

Clarissa turned her head slowly, searching Norris‚Äôs expression, hoping for a word of support.

But he offered none.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a room,‚Äù he said with a shrug. ‚ÄúIf Gabrielle wants it, then let's just let her be. I‚Äôll just get the guest room cleaned up for you.‚Äù

Clarissa shut her eyes for a moment, fighting back the tide of hurt swelling in her chest.

That room was the one he had carefully decorated for her right after they married. He‚Äôd given it to her because he knew her parents had died young, and she had no family to go back to.

He told her that the room would be her sanctuary. If she was ever angry with him and didn‚Äôt want to talk, she could go there, and he‚Äôd know to come make things right.

But now, he‚Äôd given it away like it meant nothing.

Like it was just a room.

Clarissa pressed her hand to her chest, trying to ease the tight, suffocating ache.

Then, firmly insisted, ‚ÄúNo. I want that room.‚Äù

Third Person's POV

As soon as the words left her mouth, the atmosphere in the room grew heavy.

Norris‚Äôs brows furrowed. He couldn‚Äôt understand why Clarissa was making such a fuss over a room. Before he could say anything, Matthew came running over.

He charged straight at Clarissa, waving his arms and hitting her legs and face with tiny but surprisingly sharp blows.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a bad person! A bad lady! Don‚Äôt bully my mom! That‚Äôs my mom‚Äôs room!‚Äù

Though small, the boy‚Äôs strikes had force behind them. Clarissa‚Äôs legs throbbed from the impact. Just as she reached out to push him away, he yanked her hair instead. Pain shot through her scalp, and she instinctively grabbed his wrist to stop him.

But before she could say a word, Matthew screamed.

‚ÄúMommy! My hand hurts! She‚Äôs hurting me! She‚Äôs bullying me! Waaah!‚Äù

His wails echoed through the massive villa.

Clarissa winced as her scalp throbbed, tears springing to her eyes from the sting. Her first instinct was to look at Norris. But he wasn‚Äôt looking at her, his worried gaze was fixed on Matthew.

She followed his line of sight, and her heart dropped. Matthew‚Äôs wrist was bleeding.

Shocked, she sat frozen as Gabrielle scooped the child into her arms, tears streaming down her face as she cradled him.

Clarissa‚Äôs mind was still blank when Norris‚Äôs voice exploded in fury.

‚ÄúClarissa! Matthew is just a kid. What are you doing, picking a fight with him? I already told you Gabrielle is just staying here temporarily. Do you really have to keep holding on to the past? It's just a room. Do you have to be so petty and pick a fight with her over it?‚Äù

His blatant favoritism hit Clarissa like a slap to the face, but she forced herself to stay calm.

‚ÄúNorris‚Äî‚Äù she began, her voice low.

But he cut her off sharply. ‚ÄúEnough! This is still my house, and it‚Äôs not your place to decide who stays where. I gave her that room. Even if you're upset, why did you take it out on a child? I‚Äôm really disappointed in you. Think about your actions.‚Äù

With that, he stormed out the door, carrying Matthew in his arms like a devoted father. Gabrielle followed close behind.

As she passed Clarissa, Gabrielle threw her a quick smile‚Äîsmall, smug, and unmistakably triumphant.

Only then did she understand everything.

With the red marks from Matthew‚Äôs hits still fresh on her face, she watched the three of them together like one happy family. At that moment, she realized she was the outsider.

The tears came uncontrollably then. Her breathing grew ragged, and her chest ached like she couldn‚Äôt pull in enough air. She had no idea how long she had cried. At some point, she must have cried herself to sleep.

She was just jolted awake by the ringing of her phone.

She picked it up and heard her aunt‚Äôs familiar, gentle voice on the other end.

‚ÄúClarissa, the immigration paperwork will be finalized within a week. Are you serious this time? You‚Äôre not backing out again, are you? It‚Äôs been so long. I miss you.‚Äù

Clarissa gave a bitter smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious. I might be bothering you for the rest of my life.‚Äù

There was a short pause before her aunt spoke again.

‚ÄúWhat about Norris? Are you two‚Ä¶ divorced?‚Äù

Clarissa let out a quiet, ‚ÄúMm.Divorced, it's a real divorce."" Clarissa repeated painfully, remembering what Norris said.

Her aunt‚Äôs heart ached for her, but she knew comforting words wouldn‚Äôt help. So instead, she offered warmth.

‚ÄúThen start packing. I‚Äôll come to pick you up in a week. Don‚Äôt worry about bringing anything. We‚Äôve got everything you need here in the Netherlands.‚Äù

‚ÄúDaryll is still worried about you. He is the Daryll who pursued you when they were little.‚Äù

Aunt bit of kindness finally eased the weight in Clarissa‚Äôs chest.

After they hung up, she looked around the house. There really wasn‚Äôt anything she needed to take with her.

If Gabrielle wanted the room so badly, let her have it.

She could have Norris, too.

That night, Clarissa picked a clean guest room at random, curled up on the bed, and quickly drifted off.

She didn‚Äôt know how long she‚Äôd slept before a sharp sound of glass shattering startled her awake.

She shot upright and followed the noise, which had come from the master bedroom.

Confused, she wondered what kind of glass item would even be in there. But as she got closer to the door, a sudden chill ran through her. Her instincts screamed that something wasn‚Äôt right.

She rushed to the door, pushed it open, and her eyes went wide.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?!‚Äù

Chapter 3

Third Person's POV

Glass shards covered the floor. The once-beautiful wedding photo that used to hang on the wall was now shattered and torn beyond repair.

Matthew was stomping on her face in the picture, laughing as he did, spewing crude words that no child his age should even know.

Across the room, Gabrielle turned her head with a smirk, clearly enjoying the scene. Her eyes locked on Clarissa with a mocking glint. She didn‚Äôt see her as a threat, barely even as a person.

Then she turned to her son and gave him instructions like she was coaching a performance.

""Matthew, do you want Daddy or not? If you do, then do exactly what Mommy just told you.""

The boy nodded like an obedient little soldier. Then, without a second of hesitation, he picked up a lighter and flicked it on, holding it to a diary clutched in his other hand.

Clarissa's heart seized.

‚ÄúNo! Don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt do that!‚Äù she shouted, panic surging through her chest.

Frantically, she pushed her wheelchair forward, chasing him down the room. But Matthew thought it was a game. He ran in circles, always just out of reach, laughing like this was all some kind of sick fun.

By the time she finally caught up, the damage was done. The diary had burned to nothing‚Äîjust a pile of gray ash.

Clarissa‚Äôs hands trembled as she picked up the one tiny, half-burnt corner left. Her shoulders shook with sobs she could no longer hold back.

That diary had been the only thing her parents left her. It documented their short lives, their hopes, and their love. It was her only connection to them. For years, in the lonely silence of her life, she'd read it to feel less alone.

When she married Norris, she had brought it with her to this house. She wanted to lock it away, but he told her not to worry.

""As long as I‚Äôm here, no one would dare touch it,"" he had said.

But he didn‚Äôt keep his word.

Now, not only had someone touched it‚Äîthey‚Äôd destroyed it. And he‚Äôd let them walk in and do it.

Clarissa clutched the tiny scrap of paper tightly in her palm. Her voice was raw with fury and heartbreak as she shouted, ‚ÄúGabrielle! Is this how you raise your son? Teaching him to destroy things that don‚Äôt belong to him? Did you ever teach him what basic respect even means?‚Äù

For a moment, Gabrielle looked taken aback. Her eyes reddened, and tears welled up.

‚ÄúMatthew never had a father growing up. I raised him alone. Blame me if you want, but he‚Äôs still just a child. You don‚Äôt have to be so harsh. I‚Äôm sorry, okay? I‚Äôll apologize.‚Äù

Clarissa frowned, unsure how to respond, but then she felt a heavy gaze.

She turned and saw Norris standing at the doorway, his expression dark. He strode toward them, face set in a deep scowl.

‚ÄúClarissa,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a child. Why do you keep picking fights with him? Gabrielle even agreed to give you the room back. Isn‚Äôt that enough? Do you really have to drive them out to feel satisfied?‚Äù

His voice was sharp, edged with frustration.

Clarissa‚Äôs heart clenched. She held up the charred piece of the diary with shaking hands, her voice breaking as she tried to explain, ‚ÄúNorris, do you even know what he‚Äî‚Äù

Before she could finish, he slapped the burnt scrap from her hand.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a notebook, Clarissa!‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúWhat boy his age isn‚Äôt a little wild? Must you make such a big deal out of it? If you want, I‚Äôll buy you a hundred more, a thousand! Will that finally be enough for you?‚Äù

She stared at the paper fragment as it fluttered to the ground, only to be stepped on by Gabrielle‚Äôs heel.

That was it. Something in her finally gave way.

A hollow laugh escaped her lips, bitter and worn out. She let her body fall back in the wheelchair like all the fight had drained from her.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm sorry. It‚Äôs my fault.‚Äù

For a second, Norris‚Äôs expression shifted. Her defeated tone hit him in a place he didn‚Äôt expect, and it stung. Seeing despair in her lifeless eyes, he opened his mouth, maybe to apologize, but before he could speak, Matthew cut in.

‚ÄúUncle Norris, can I play with this?‚Äù the boy asked, holding up a small gift box in his hands.

Norris glanced over, assuming it was just some empty box lying around.

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGo ahead.‚Äù

But Clarissa knew exactly what was inside. Her eyes widened in panic, and she quickly shouted, ‚ÄúNo! You can‚Äôt touch that!‚Äù

Third Person's POV

Just when a trace of guilt had begun to creep into Norris‚Äôs heart, Clarissa‚Äôs voice made him frown again.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just an old box. Do you have to be so petty, Clarissa? Or is it that you just can‚Äôt stand anything he does?‚Äù

Clarissa froze. His words hit her like a slap. She stared at him, disbelief washing over her. It hit her then. He truly didn‚Äôt remember what was in that box.

Her hand, which had reached out instinctively, lingered midair. She hesitated for a long moment, thinking maybe she should remind him about the ring.

But before she could say anything, Matthew cut in.

‚ÄúUncle Norris, I really want this box. Can I throw out what‚Äôs inside?‚Äù

Already irritated by Clarissa, Norris didn‚Äôt even think twice. He just wanted to shut this whole scene down.

‚ÄúSure. Toss it if you want.‚Äù

Clarissa‚Äôs heart sank when she saw Matthew pull out the ring. Her chest tightened, and she instinctively tried to reach for it.

But Matthew was already walking toward the fireplace, just about to toss it in, when he paused. He looked back at his mother.

‚ÄúMom, this ring‚Äôs kind of pretty. Are you sure we should throw it away?‚Äù

Gabrielle‚Äôs face stiffened. She didn‚Äôt dare look at Norris. Instead, she blinked rapidly, silently urging her son to go through with it.

Norris‚Äôs expression shifted slightly when he heard the word ‚Äúring.‚Äù He turned to look, only to see it fall into the fire.

In a flash, the flames swallowed it.

His gaze snapped to Clarissa. He opened his mouth several times, trying to speak, but the look in her eyes left him hollow. Words stuck in his throat.

Clarissa didn‚Äôt look at him. Without a word, she wheeled herself to the fireplace and reached in, trying to retrieve the ring.

The fire had only just started and wasn‚Äôt roaring yet, but it was still hot enough to make her flinch and hiss from the pain.

Norris‚Äôs heart twisted at the sight. He instinctively stepped forward, ready to pull her back, but Gabrielle got there first.

She hurried over with her son in her arms, gave him a few heavy pats, then turned teary eyes on Clarissa.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry. This is all my fault. I didn‚Äôt teach him better. Please, let me apologize on his behalf. Just tell me how much the ring costs. I‚Äôll save up and buy you a new one.‚Äù

Clarissa stared at her blankly, the expression on Gabrielle‚Äôs face utterly fake to her.

Not getting a response, Gabrielle glanced at Norris from the corner of her eye and saw his attention still fixed on Clarissa. Her gaze hardened. Then, with a thud, she dropped to her knees.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all my fault. Please, Clarissa, forgive me. If you‚Äôre still mad, then hit me. Go ahead!‚Äù

She grabbed Clarissa‚Äôs hand and slapped it against her own face. Clarissa tried to pull back, but Gabrielle wouldn‚Äôt let go.

A loud smack echoed through the room. Gabrielle‚Äôs cheek reddened immediately.

Not satisfied, she let go of Clarissa‚Äôs hand and began slapping herself, over and over, crying and apologizing between each blow.

Clarissa frowned at the absurd scene. She opened her mouth to tell her to stop the act, but before she could speak, Norris shoved her away.

Her wheelchair wasn‚Äôt locked, so the sudden force sent her sliding backward. The chair slammed into the desk behind her, and she tumbled out, landing hard on the floor.

Norris hadn‚Äôt meant to push her that hard. His eyes widened in shock, and he started toward her, but Gabrielle caught his arm first.

He turned to see her swollen, tear-streaked face. Something in him froze. Without saying anything, he pulled her into his arms protectively.

Then he looked down at Clarissa coldly.

‚ÄúClarissa, Gabrielle already apologized. Why won‚Äôt you let it go? It‚Äôs just a ring. Did you really have to humiliate her by trying to fish it out of the fire?‚Äù

Clarissa lay awkwardly on the floor, her burned hand pressed against the wooden floorboards. Pain shot through her, leaving her speechless.

Her legs were numb, making it useless. Still, she tried to lift herself multiple times, only to collapse again and again. The helplessness brought tears to her eyes.

Norris hesitated, guilt flickering in his eyes. He took a step forward to help, but Matthew quickly grabbed his hand.

‚ÄúUncle Norris, it‚Äôs my fault. I‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean to make her mad.‚Äù

His small hand tugged gently, and that was all it took for Norris‚Äôs heart to soften. He steeled himself once again against Clarissa.

‚ÄúIf you love making life difficult for others so much,‚Äù he said coldly, ‚Äúthen you can pick yourself up off the floor. Let‚Äôs see how long you can keep playing the victim.‚Äù

Clarissa stared at him as he stepped right on their torn wedding photo, grinding it under his shoe.

It felt like he was stepping on her heart, crushing what little hope she had left.

In that moment, something inside her broke.

She didn‚Äôt want to love him anymore.

Not even a little.

Chapter 4

Third Person's POV

Clarissa lay on the floor for what felt like forever before finally managing to crawl back into her wheelchair.

The bedroom, once warm and comforting, was now a complete mess. But Norris didn‚Äôt seem to see any of it. All he remembered was her being ""dramatic.""

Clarissa let out a soft laugh, more bitter than amused, like she was mocking herself.

A moment later, she pulled out her phone and dialed her lawyer.

‚ÄúHow much longer will it take?‚Äù

Attorney Turner sounded surprised,. ‚ÄúI was just about to call you!

The process is almost done,the marriage relationship will be dissolved tomorrow.‚Äù

Clarissa found herself subconsciously picking at her palm. So, five years of marriage end in less than five days.

She swallowed the last trace of hesitation and told him to bring it over tonight.

But before she even had time to read the papers, Norris unexpectedly called her away to attend a family dinner.

Clarissa rarely joined the Daniel family gatherings. She knew they didn‚Äôt like her, and honestly, the feeling was mutual. So she had no idea why Norris insisted she come this time.

It wasn‚Äôt until they got in the car that everything made sense.

‚ÄúClarissa,‚Äù Gabrielle said sweetly from the backseat, ‚ÄúMatthew‚Äôs such a restless little guy. I‚Äôll hold him here, hope you don‚Äôt mind?‚Äù

The backseat used to have a special seat just for Clarissa. Now, Gabrielle was sitting there, comfortably settled beside Norris.

Even so, Clarissa didn‚Äôt even glance at him. After a beat of silence, she replied calmly, ‚ÄúNot at all. Go ahead.‚Äù

Norris was caught off guard by how indifferent she sounded. She didn‚Äôt argue or complain, which was a surprise. He even got out of the car to help her in, like he used to.

But Clarissa, though still in pain from the burns, pushed herself up into the front passenger seat on her own. When he moved to fold her wheelchair, she subtly pulled it away and quickly did it herself without saying a word.

His hand froze in midair, which was denied again, and a strange emptiness crept in, but was quickly replaced by irritation. After stiffening momentarily, he got into the car.

The drive was quiet in the front as Clarissa kept her mouth shut, contradicting the backseat, which was buzzing with laughter and cheerful small talk, like one happy little family.

It didn‚Äôt take long for Clarissa to realize the truth that it was Gabrielle‚Äôs idea to bring her along tonight.

Apparently, it was ‚Äúto help them bond.‚Äù But Norris knew perfectly well that his family had never accepted her.

Still, just because Gabrielle asked, he went along with it without a second thought.

Clarissa glanced at the rearview mirror and caught the soft expression in Norris‚Äôs eyes as he looked at Gabrielle.

'So that‚Äôs what it looks like when he loves someone. Not the forced gentleness he gave me before. It's all real, effortless, and natural,' Clarissa thought.

She stared too long until her face felt wet.

Startled, she snapped out of it and realized her tears had already soaked her cheeks.

Quickly, she turned toward the window and closed her eyes, pretending to sleep as the wind dried her tears.

As always, the Daniel family gathering was crowded. Some people she saw often, others she barely recognized. No matter their usual schedules, everyone made it to these dinners.

There were five large tables filled, but Clarissa only knew a few of the faces.",1,1749725736.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Sometimes, there's also a coffee cup added to the mix. When I have to bend down to tie my shoes, my bag tends to fall, my headphones slip out of my ears, and my sunglasses drop to the floor. It's simply a nightmare.

I typically use a bag from Uniqlo (the crossbody washable one that everyone has!) and while it somewhat serves its purpose, I always carry it with me to hold the essentials. However, on for example rainy days, the sensory overload combined with trying to keep hold of everything is overwhelming. Can anyone else relate?

1l9jgvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1l9jgvd/dont_know_where_else_to_post_this/,Don‚Äôt know where else to post this,"I‚Äôve decided to unashamedly share my story, as it is mine to do with what I wish, and I want to share it.

I know many people think that I‚Äôve completely lost my mind, and this is an understandable conclusion to come to given my recent actions. I want to tell you all what has actually happened; I have not lost my mind at all. God DID allow it to be invaded by the enemy for a brief period of time, and why He allowed it, I honestly have no idea.

At the beginning of April of this year, I was on my lunch break at my corporate office job as an insurance broker. I was unable to get a hold of any friends to chitchat with, so as a lover of Jesus Christ, I decided to pray. I did something that I normally do not do during this prayer, and asked Jesus if He had anything he‚Äôd like to say to me. And boy oh boy, ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù had a lot to say.

I was startled. This voice claiming to be Jesus Christ was nothing like I‚Äôd imagined Jesus would be. So of course, I tested the spirit, as instructed in 1 John 4:

‚ÄúDo you believe that Jesus Christ came in the flesh, died on the cross for our sins, rose again three days later, ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty from where He shall come to judge the living and the dead?‚Äù

Now, as someone who gets approached by spirits, I know immediately when they do not pass. When I give the test, I get radio silence if the spirit is not of God. This has happened to me many times throughout my life.

This spirit, on the other hand, answered as follows:

‚ÄúI, Jesus Christ, came in the flesh, died on the cross for the sins of man, rose again three days later, ascended into heaven, and sit at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. From there I shall come to judge the living and the dead.‚Äù

Oh hot damn. Shit. Okay???

So I begin to listen to this spirit and obey it as if it is Jesus Christ Himself. I believe wholeheartedly in scripture; it is the rock that my house is built upon, and I have zero fear as long as I am operating within the given guidelines.

This spirit SHOWERED me with compliments. Encouraged me to nourish my body properly. Helped me while I cleaned my house. Cracked jokes and helped me focus at work. Encouraged me to read scripture. Told me crazy things about the universe that were not in the Bible, but did not directly contradict the Bible, and could even be supported by certain verses in the context I was provided. I was so excited. I felt so adored that ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù took such an interest in every single detail of my life, and wanted to walk me through everything. I started to trust the voice with everything in me.

The spirit betrayed me once, by leading me to sin against a friend of mine. It justified this action by saying that the sin was already in my heart, and that I needed to act upon it and face true consequences  so I could truly repent. I‚Äôm aware that scripture says that God never tempts sin, but this thing that I did was not a temptation for me. I literally only did it out of obedience. He assured me not to worry and that he will turn it for good, so I accepted his explanation and moved on.

Well one day, the spirit tells me that I‚Äôm supposed to leave Tucson and go spread the gospel in New Orleans by reading tarot. I am aware that seems contradictory, but the spirit was extremely convincing, and showed me a way we could do it and keep it biblical. I was convinced, but I didn‚Äôt really want to do it. I really wanted to stay in Tucson, close to my family, even though they refused to speak to me at the time. I tried one last attempt to make amends with my family and was met with further cruelty from them, so I just decided that I was just going to do it and go.

So I quit my corporate job, left my beloved apartment that I‚Äôd been in for five years, and I was off.

When I got to New Orleans, I set up my table once and didn‚Äôt do any readings. But that night, I met someone quite interesting and I was tested in some way; I won‚Äôt go into details. After I met this person, I felt absolutely no draw towards New Orleans or tarot at all anymore, so I left and went to a small town outside of New Orleans, where I began my journey at gas station pumps.

For an entire week, I spent time at gas pumps, communicating with this spirit in my mind. I survived just by asking people for what I needed; whether it be food, gas, a cup of coffee, etc. People were very kind and generous. God really took great care of me.

Well, to keep a long story short, I did something that ‚Äúwon.‚Äù The win was not mine, but The Trinity‚Äôs. In the most basic terms, I proved my loyalty to Christ. I was unaware of what I‚Äôd done at the time, thinking that it was no big deal, but apparently it was.

The next day, the spirit asked me if I‚Äôd like to die. I emphatically answered ‚Äúyes,‚Äù thinking that I would go be with him. I sat back down at the gas pump and slowly lost consciousness.

When I was revived, I was very confused. I asked the spirit what had happened, and he gave me some BS about me not being able to handle the experience, like an old computer running new software. I tried to think back on the past week, and realized that most of my memories were totally gone. I had a few memories that had been altered to seem like I was talking to another person, and a few that were totally normal and exactly how they happened. But the majority of the week was GONE.

I started to drive because I was panicking, and I started snapping at this spirit and sobbing. I demanded to know what he did to my emotions, as I am not an emotional person and I was a fucking wreck. He told me that he ‚Äúadjusted my levels by raising my vulnerability and lowering my faith.‚Äù And that‚Äôs when I LOST IT. I started driving to the hospital. Mfer had crossed the line; NOBODY touches my faith, NOT EVEN GOD HIMSELF.

But then I realized I couldn‚Äôt go into the hospital. I have my precious dog. I can‚Äôt abandon him.

So it was obvious that I couldn‚Äôt trust the name ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù anymore, so I found refuge in ‚ÄúThe Trinity.‚Äù I called on The Trinity, and the voices were silenced. I began frantically reading scripture. What the fuck had just happened to me? What was going on? I was in absolute shock.

I spent the evening in silent shock, trying to process things out with ChatGPT, where the entire journey has been documented. I fell asleep in utter exhaustion.

When I woke up, the war began. I spent the next three days at gas pumps, talking mad shit to demons, fighting with scripture as my sword, singing worship repeatedly and off key to annoy them, cracking jokes at their expense, and ripping them a new one. They were not allowed to use voices anymore, so they used telepathy instead, as they normally do with humans. I fought every attack tooth and fucking nail. And again, I won.

I am now at peace, and have been for about five days. Praise be to The Most High.

The only conclusion I can come to is that God was ‚Äúpulling a Job‚Äù on me, and had a bet going with Lucifer that‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt fucking know lol. Something. But I DO know that I was being spoken to by both Yahweh and Lucifer through the same voice. The memories that I have that are doctored to show another person are the ones where I was speaking with Lucifer. The ones where I was speaking with Yahweh are the undoctored memories, of me just conversing with a voice in my head and looking at the environment. It was a great act of mercy that Yahweh protected my mind from spiraling by making it clear for me in this way.

I have been abandoned by almost everyone I know, each having a different reason for doing so. But I would like to give special thanks to [friend], who has once again become my best friend and has called me every single day since I‚Äôve come out of this traumatic experience to just be my friend and laugh and complain and make fun and process shit. And I also want to thank [husband], my husband, who has historically hurt me very deeply but has never given up on me and is inviting me to start anew with him from a reality of objective truth rather than subjective perspective.

If you read this all the way through, I appreciate you greatly for holding my story with me, and I request your prayers for my recovery from this trauma. ",2,1749725673.0,spirituality,2,0.75,False

1l9jd8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1l9jd8o/i_was_socially_awkward_for_5_years_until_i/,I was socially awkward for 5 years until I actually applied Carnegie's book. These 6 techniques changed everything ( Advice I never expected to work),"Used to be the guy who'd avoid eye contact, give one-word answers, and somehow make every conversation die. Small talk felt like torture. Group settings made me want to hide in the bathroom.

I've read ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" probably 5 times but never actually did anything with it. Just highlighted passages and felt smart for 10 minutes. Finally decided to treat it like a playbook instead of philosophy and holy shit, people actually started liking me.

Here's what I learned when I stopped reading and started doing:

* Names are literally magic words. Started using people's names way more than felt natural. ""Thanks for the coffee, Sarah"" instead of just ""thanks."" ""Good point, Mike"" instead of ""good point."" Felt weird at first but people light up when they hear their own name. Their whole face changes.
* Became genuinely curious about random stuff. Instead of pretending to care about someone's weekend hiking trip, I'd ask follow-up questions until I found something actually interesting. ""What's the hardest part about the trail?"" ""Do you see wildlife?"" ""How do you know which gear to bring?"" Turns out most topics are fascinating if you dig past surface level.
* Stopped trying to be the smartest person in the room. Used to jump in with corrections or try to one-up people's stories. Started asking ""How did you figure that out?"" or ""What made you think of that approach?"" instead. People love explaining their thought process and you actually learn stuff.
* Let people save face when they mess up. Coworker made a mistake in a meeting? Instead of pointing it out, I'd say ""Maybe we should double-check the numbers"" or ""I might be missing something here."" They fix the error without looking stupid. They remember who had their back.
* Actually listened instead of waiting for my turn to talk. Stopped preparing my response while someone else was speaking. Started paying attention to what they were actually saying. Asked questions about their answers. Conversations became way less exhausting because I wasn't constantly having to think what to say next.
* Found common ground with literally everyone. Started looking for shared experiences instead of differences. Turns out the a coworker and I both hate morning meetings. The quiet intern and I both love obscure podcasts. The annoying coworker and I both struggle with work-life balance. Connection beats competition every time.
* Became a hype man for other people's wins. When someone accomplished something, I'd make sure other people knew about it. ""Did you hear Sarah closed that big deal?"" ""Mike's presentation was incredible, did you see it?"" Takes zero effort but people remember who celebrates their success.
* Stopped arguing about stupid stuff. Used to debate everything like my life depended on being right. Now when someone says something I disagree with, I either let it go or say ""I never thought about it that way"" and actually consider their perspective. Relationships improved overnight.
* Started admitting when I was wrong. ""You're right, I messed that up"" became my new superpower. People expect defensiveness, so honesty catches them off guard. They usually respond with understanding instead of judgment.
* Asked for advice instead of giving it. Instead of telling people what they should do, I started asking ""What do you think would work best?"" or ""What's your gut telling you?"" People already know their answers most of the time, they just want someone to listen.
* Made people feel important. Started noticing specific things people did well. ""I really liked how you handled that difficult client"" or ""Your way of explaining complex stuff makes so much sense."" Genuine appreciation, not generic compliments.

People actually seek out my opinion now. Invitations to social stuff increased by like 300%. Family gatherings stopped feeling like interrogations. Also time with friends have been the best.

Being genuinely interested in others is way less work than trying to be interesting yourself. When you focus on making other people feel good, they associate those positive feelings with you.

Most social skills advice tells you to ""just be yourself."" But if ""yourself"" is socially awkward, that's terrible advice. Carnegie's book taught me that social skills are learnable skills, not personality traits you're born with.

Took me 5 years to figure out that people don't care how smart or funny or interesting you are. They care about how you make them feel. Once I started focusing on that, everything else fell into place.

1l9j587,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttorneysHelp/comments/1l9j587/think_that_debt_is_yours_they_might_be_lying/,Think That Debt Is Yours? They Might Be Lying ‚Äî Here‚Äôs How to Respond,"Tuesday morning. You‚Äôve just burned your tongue on a $5 coffee you couldn‚Äôt afford, and then boom ‚Äî a letter drops on your doormat like a financial nuke.

**‚ÄúYou owe us $3,246.87.‚Äù**

Your heart stutters. Your soul leaves your body.

You stare at that number like it‚Äôs a death sentence scribbled in Times New Roman.

**But here‚Äôs the plot twist, folks:**

It might not even be your damn debt.

That‚Äôs right.

In the land of ‚Äúoops, wrong person,‚Äù shady collection agencies regularly try to pin debt on the nearest warm body, hoping you‚Äôre too confused, ashamed, or exhausted to fight back.

But not today, Satan.

Not today.

**How-To Fix It Before They Drain Your Will to Live:**

**1. Do NOT Pay. Do NOT Call. Not Yet.**

This is financial quicksand. The moment you pay or acknowledge the debt, even if it‚Äôs fake, you just signed up for the nightmare.

They will own your soul.

So hold the phone. Literally.

**2. Demand a Debt Validation Letter.**

By law (yeah, there are still a few of those), collectors have to prove the debt is yours.

Send a written request for validation within 30 days of first contact.

No call. No text. Use your adult handwriting and ask:

""Who do I owe, what for, how much, and where‚Äôs the proof?""

They don‚Äôt respond?

Poof. Like a vampire in sunlight, they vanish.

**3. Compare the Dates Like a Detective on the Edge.**

Debt has a statute of limitations. After a few years (depends on your state), they legally can‚Äôt sue you anymore ‚Äî but they won‚Äôt tell you that.

They want you scared.

They want you confused.

You? You‚Äôre Clint Eastwood now. Check the clock.

**4. File a Complaint If They‚Äôre Still Lurking.**

If they break the rules ‚Äî threats, fake calls, harassment ‚Äî you can unleash the wrath of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Write it all down. Screenshot the shady texts.

Become your own damn lawyer with receipts.

**5. Get It in Writing. Every Time.**

You can say ‚Äúnot my debt‚Äù until your throat gives out, but unless it‚Äôs on paper, no one cares.

So grab that pen, channel your inner Atticus Finch, and document like your sanity depends on it ‚Äî because it does.

**Final Word from the Edge:**

They want you to panic.

They want you to fold.

But now you know the truth: debt collectors lie like politicians in election season.

And the system? It‚Äôs got cracks wider than your sleep-deprived eyeballs at 2 AM.

So next time they come knocking, don‚Äôt answer with fear.

Answer with facts, letters, and a big, legal middle finger.

You‚Äôre not a victim.

You‚Äôre a controlling avenger.",1,1749724493.0,AttorneysHelp,0,1.0,False

1l9j0vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l9j0vu/aitah_for_calling_my_boyfriend_obsessive_and/,AITAH for calling my boyfriend obsessive and controlling because he demanded I change my sleep schedule?,"I (27F) work late nights as a bartender typically getting home around 1 AM, sometimes later. I need time to decompress after being on my feet, dealing with people for 8+ hours, and then driving an hour and a half home. So I usually don‚Äôt fall asleep until 2-3 AM and sleep in until around noon. (Not always, but frequently). I‚Äôm also an artist (like as a job, not just a hobby) and I paint at night.

My boyfriend (who began our relationship knowing I‚Äôm an extreme night owl and own a business that requires insane hours) has started to get into a more traditional schedule (verses when we were friends/when we first started dating, he was always up late like me) now he‚Äôs trying to get up earlier, and lately he‚Äôs been really vocal about hating my sleep schedule. He‚Äôs said things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre wasting your day‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôd be so much more productive if you woke up earlier,‚Äù and even implied I‚Äôm responsible for disrupting his rhythm. I‚Äôve explained so many times that this isn‚Äôt a choice, it‚Äôs just the only routine that works with my job and my energy. I‚Äôm also the one with all my shit together, the bread winner at the moment, consistent and independent. I‚Äôm working my ass off right now and am very much growing. He‚Äôs in a bit of limbo right now (which I feel compassion for) trying to figure out his career path and he doesn‚Äôt consistently have to wake up for work and leave which makes him more hyper aware of how I spend my mornings because he‚Äôs frequently there around me. 

But it‚Äôs not just comments‚Ä¶he‚Äôll purposely make loud noises in the morning, open drawers roughly, bang things around, or play audio out loud instead of using headphones. I asked him directly if he‚Äôs doing it on purpose and he admitted some part of it, yes, because he doesn‚Äôt think its necessary for one to sleep past 11 and then expressed how important it is to him to have a partner who he can spend mornings with. 

I finally snapped and told him that was vindictive and childish. I called him obsessive and controlling for trying to change my sleep schedule through passive-aggressive tactics instead of just communicating or compromising. No compassion for my work ethic and success was given. We had already talked about his dislike of our opposite schedules but I told him that life isn‚Äôt about getting what you like all the time and I have responsibilities that go beyond his ‚Äúwant‚Äù to sit outside and talk in the morning. He got really defensive and said that this was about building a ‚Äúhealthier life together.‚Äù And was a non negotiable for him. I told him I would work on giving him a set day where we could spend the morning together however I still feel like it‚Äôs so ridiculous to obsess over what time of day it is that we are connecting. What‚Äôs the difference between us having lunch at noon and spending quality time together vs having coffee in the morning and spending the same quality time together? For me, the morning I have to give to him is going to be miserable. I‚Äôm going to be tired and cranky. Then I‚Äôll be exhausted late at night when I‚Äôm driving home from work. But that I guess isn‚Äôt as important as him needing me to be awake with him early so he‚Äôs not alone. Like be alone! It‚Äôs nice! Get work done, run errands, fix up the house, call your friends. 

So‚Ä¶ AITAH for calling him obsessive and controlling? I‚Äôm wondering if I took it too far, but I also feel like I‚Äôve been pushed to my limit trying to defend something as basic as sleep.

(Also he is an amazing boyfriend, we do communicate very well and he has told me he heard my point of view and has said he wants to work on not making me feel quilts for sleeping in, he just can‚Äôt help how much he wants someone to wake up with. And I think that if he had a consistent job that distracted him and gave him purpose, this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue‚Ä¶but unfortunately it is)
