by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **The Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Portland Trail Blazers: A One-Sided Comedy of Errors**

The Oklahoma City Thunder (19-1) are set to stomp on the Portland Trail Blazers (8-11) like a toddler on a stress ball. With a **-12.5-point spread** and **moneyline odds of -750**, the Thunder are so heavily favored that even their warm-up routine makes the Blazers’ coaching staff cry into their coffee. The total is set at **231.5 points**, but with the Blazers missing **Jrue Holiday, Damian Lillard, and four other starters**, this game might as well be a Thunder scrimmage.

### Why the Thunder Will Win:

* **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander** is coming off **37 points** in their last game and is -108 to score **over 31.5 points** tonight. He’s basically the NBA’s version of a guaranteed bet.
* **Chet Holmgren** (-122) is projected to grab **over 8.5 rebounds**, which is about as shocking as snow in December.
* The Blazers are missing their **starting point guard entirely**, so their best hope, **Deni Avdija**, is facing a -105 prop to score **over 22.5 points**. Good luck, Deni—your team’s fate rests on your shoulders like a 300-pound barista’s tip jar.

### Why the Blazers Will Lose:

* They’re starting **Sidy Cissoko** and **Toumani Camara**, two players whose combined career All-Star appearances total zero. Camara is -110 to score **over 12.5 points**—a lofty goal for a guy who averages 2.3 PPG.
* Their “center” is **Donovan Clingan**, who’s

She muttered “ok…” and went to her room. Later she told me it was “aggressive energy for 8 AM” and that maybe I need therapy if I’m beefing with a speaker.

I apologized but she’s still acting weird, and my other friends say yelling at Alexa is unhinged behavior.

This weekend felt soooo full of everything — leftover Thanksgiving feelings, Black Friday chaos, that Marissa Torres news update, and then something totally unexpected from Winfrey!


---

🌤️ Saturday — A Super Chill… but Kinda Wild Day

I woke up late today (Mom said my belly was “hibernating after all that turkey”).
Jennifer was reading the news again at the dining table, and guess what?

📺 Marissa Torres Update!

They finally got her down from the shopping mall signboard!!
(Thank goodness… her poor giant belly looked so heavy on TV yesterday.)

Jennifer joked,

> “At least she didn’t float away like a giant parade balloon.”



Mom gave her The Look™ and said,

> “Have some sympathy, Jennifer.”



But then SHE laughed too, so I guess… everyone found it funny now that she’s safe.

The news said she told reporters:
“I will never climb anything before coffee again.”

We all cracked up. Even Shelley snorted orange juice.

📚 Afternoon With Friends at Coffee Day

Carmen, Penny, Kira and I met at Coffee Day again — and of course Zoe was there with Haruka and the staff, all in their matching black outfits. They heard about the Marissa Torres thing too.

Zoe sighed dramatically,

> “If that signboard was outside my café, it would’ve trended twice as fast.”



Haruka added,

> “Actually, maybe three times. Coffee stains always go viral.”



We ALL glared at her at the same time.
Haruka just winked.

📘 Winfrey’s Big Surprise: NEW BOOKS!

Then Winfrey marched in like she was holding treasure.

And she WAS.

1. The new Narnia Remake Novel

She said it’s a modern reinterpretation with more magical maps, new world-building illustrations, and a whole expanded arc for Lucy.

2. THE ADVENTURES OF TONYA SAWYER

Inspired by Mark Twain’s original Tom Sawyer — but THIS version is:

about Tonya Sawyer

still mischievous

still adventurous

still loves exploring

AND she’s apparently hilarious and chaotic

AND the author wrote it like a tribute to “girls with bold hearts”


Winfrey said:

> “Amy, Tonya Sawyer reminds me of YOU—
except she doesn’t have eight sisters and a mother who makes the whole house practice posture.”



HEY!
Okay… maybe she’s not wrong.

Penny is already planning to read it during class next week “if the teacher doesn’t look”.


---

🌙 Sunday — Cozy Home Day

Mom made pumpkin pancakes in the morning because she said,

> “Thanksgiving calories don’t count until Monday.”



Melissa was arranging flowers again —
Vicky complained:

> “She’s talking to the roses more than to us.”



Melissa protested,

> “They are delicate! And roses listen better than siblings.”



We all laughed.

The afternoon was quiet — everyone worked on something:

Jennifer answered emails

Vicky helped Mom clean

Melissa decorated the dining table with new blooms

Heather practiced her cheer jumps

Gillian studied crime documentaries again

Linda & Nina played Switch

Shelley watched old Mud Queen clips

And I reread parts of Winfrey’s Tonya Sawyer book


I REALLY like Tonya.
She’s so chaotic but kind.
And her adventures feel like something that could happen in Sunnyville…
(just with more frogs and river rafts).


---

🌆 Evening: News Update Again

Another update came about Marissa Torres — she posted a video thanking the rescue team and joked:

“If anyone asks, yes, the signboard lost. My belly won.”

Mom spit her tea laughing.


---

I feel like this weekend was a mix of comedy, warmth, adventures, and books.

The perfect pre-December vibe.
I can’t wait to tell my friends more about Tonya Sawyer tomorrow.

Their old grinder broke recently so we revisited the topic of purchasing a grinder for ourselves. Since getting the Baratza, we still get the same beans from that shop, albeit unground - doesn’t specify a roast level (looks medium) but the bags typically have a roast date within a week or two of purchase. 

Now, it’s been a bit of a nightmare trying to dial in a shot using the 2 shot single wall basket. Baratza’s recommended starting grind setting of 15 and 16 were too fine for our machine. Tried 17 and it was a bit better but an inconsistent pour so we got a WDT (MHW 3-Bomber) thinking channeling might be our problem. I grind 18g of beans (have a scale to .01), toss into basket, use the WDT (with my hand wrapped around it to prevent the coffee from spilling… probably need to get a dosing ring now, does it ever stop?), and gently tap the portafilter against the counter before tamping. It’s not a perfect tamp along the sides, almost as if the tool is too small for the basket but I figured this is normal? I pull a couple of blanks on the machine to get it heated up and then I’m off to the races. 

It seemed like regardless of the WDT, 18 was the best grind size until I descaled this morning. Since we’re still experimenting, I decided to try manually programming the shot length again with the different grind sizes. Setting 17 completely blocked the machine so I only got a few drips out before stopping it. I tried setting 18 and got about 30ml of espresso in 45 seconds - it looked like the machine was struggling to push the water through despite the setting working well before. I tried the espresso on its own and it was so freaking sour *and* bitter. Moved on to setting 19 and got a whopping 42ml in 23 seconds, including pre-infusion time… it still doesn’t taste great. It’s less sour than before but still has this mouth puckering intensity to it that feels unbalanced. 

Guys, I’m losing it. How is there such a massive difference between grind size 18 and 19? Could my tamping really be that inconsistent? Could it be either a faulty grinder or a faulty espresso machine (unlikely but I’m grasping at straws)? What else could I be missing? Should we just go back to the dual wall baskets which feels like wasted potential? Would love any advice! ",1,1764518494.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I always remembered this woman and friended her on FB.  I said hi one day about 2 months ago and we had a chat.  Since she was the one who stopped dating me the first time I didn't ask her out.

3 weeks ago, she texted me out of the blue asking me to meet for coffee.  We did and just had another date Friday and went back to her place where we cuddled and kissed, but took it no further.

I'm struggling with pacing.  I have a but of an anxious style and am trying to train myself out of that.  I can text every day reflexively.  I've been restrained and texting her every few days so far.

So, I texted yesterday just to say I had a great night Friday, it was a short conversation but seemed to go well.  She used a heart emoji to sign off.

She's not texting me regularly. It's been me that has been reaching out, but she's been receptive and inviting.

I'm going to ask her out again next weekend, but am wondering, what's the proper pacing for texting?  Should I leave it at every few days?  Don't want her to think I'm not interested, but don't want to overdo it and seem needy either.",1,1764518459.0,datingoverforty,4,1.0,False

This is a Throwaway account but have been following DPH for more than 2 years now and absolutely love the community for whatever it’s doing to encourage PetrolHeads to express themselves. 

Land Rovers and Range Rovers have been an integral part in the UAE’s automotive industry and as a JLR enthusiast I wanted to host/organize a meet up for enthusiasts to bring their cars or just turn up to know more about these beasts. 

I didn’t know how and where to start and decided to reach out to DPH. If anyone is up for a meet in the last week of December (21st, 28th, 4th Jan), then we can plan something out and also find out which place to rent/meetup and logistics involving that. 

Ideally meeting up for a morning coffee and discussing JLR vehicles would be amazing.

1palq3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1palq3i/i_have_been_struggling_for_a_few_years_now_and/,"I have been struggling for a few years now, and its going to become so much worse.","On paper, it would appear that my life is more than okay. I currently study at one of my country's top universities and have a scholarship to support it. I was also a member of one of its varsity teams until I quit after a year, citing ""focusing on my academics"" as my reason. In fact, it's more than that.   
  
During my high school years, I already started having issues with my mental health, but it wasn't that severe at the time, as I could just not go to class when I felt like it(I did so a lot of times). I also have a stable nuclear family that supports me well. We are also not that poor. That being said, starting university exacerbated my problems. I went into the school year having high hopes for myself, but I soon realized that my past issues did not really disappear. Eventually, I continued my absenteeism, which was too risky now, unlike high school, as they have an attendance requirement. In one class, I immediately leave early after the attendance has been recorded to avoid a failing grade. All that while my family at home has no idea about what *exactly* I'm going through.

Fast forward to today. I expect to fail 3 of my 4 credited courses this semester, either through excessive absences or pure difficulty(or both). In the fourth course, I was doing well on the tests as I was already retaking the course. Though my absences already exceeded the limit, so I'm basically at the mercy of my professor. 

What has been destroying my life these past few years is an embarrassing (suspected) physical illness that has kept me from being close to people. All of it, coupled with the fact that I have no friends, have social anxiety, and have really bad habits that keep me from being functional. I don't even have the natural intelligence like my classmates, so I have a hard time even understanding the lectures. I went to the doctor twice now, and their suggested medications have not fixed my main issue(alleviated maybe, but not permanent). My family knows about it now, but I can't keep reminding them about this, as they would just worry too much, and we do not have much money to fund any medical tests. Oftentimes, I think about how my life is over and that if I were to continue fighting, I would basically relive my suffering.

I believe in God(at least I'd like to, if it keeps me sane), so I have prayed to Him multiple times about my illness since high school. Of course, I understood that I had not behaved perfectly and deserved some punishment. To confess, I was severely addicted to energy drinks because they kept me mentally sharp, and they allowed me to stay on top of my studies. I eventually stopped, but by then the damage had already been done(and more so to come). I detested God for what he allowed to happen to my life, but couldn't bring myself to completely mentally abandon Him, as I am basically in an impossible situation(in my eyes). And it had always seemed to be the perfect situation for a ""miracle"". All this hope I had for years until I reached my breaking point. 

I have been passively ideating for a long time now because of my shame and insecurities. I have not yet taken action on it, not because I still have a reason to live, but because I really do not know how to plan for it. Like, where can you buy a rope? Where do you tie it? And aren't ingesting dangerous chemical substances really painful? I am drinking coffee right now as I write this, so the extra energy and enthusiasm I appear to have seem misleading. But I really have no hope for my future. And I do not want to have hope. I have been to that cycle multiple times to count, and it only really ever led to too much pain and disappointment. And seeing that I still have my life to live, assuming I don't immediately end things, it makes me furious at my nature that it keeps trying to fool me into thinking I still have a chance.

That's it. To those who took the time to read this, I am grateful that you chose to spend some of your time doing so. I have also read other entries on this subreddit, whom most of which, if not all, actually experienced suffering worse than mine, leads me to believe that some people are really just unlucky. I am sorry if I seem soft and not taking advantage of my opportunities; I just am not that resilient. I can only wish for a better reality for all of us. Even for those who have decided to end things.",1,1764518350.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False
1palpt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/chch/comments/1palpt1/searching_purpose_of_human_life/,searching purpose of human life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

*Being trans, people-pleasing, and defining a new name*

First person I heard use my name was the cashier at the Williamsburg Taco Bell, handing me the thanksgiving dinner that I ate alone amongst the chosen family of Uber drivers taking their break in silence.

I wanted to test it, see what it would be like to hear someone say that name aloud. Why I would choose a name that a good amount of people can’t pronounce (He was close, he handed me my order yelling “Sire!” A feast for a king), was my first thought. I’ve spent most of my life trying to take up as little space as possible, and now having to constantly advocate for the pronunciation of my new name every time I interact with someone seemed daunting. 

Everything is very black-and-white in the worlds that I’ve occupied. Man or Woman. Hot or Ugly. Good or Bad. Simple or Difficult. As I have taken on (or really, unintentionally assumed) the role of leader in my work life, I’ve tried as much as possible to be perceived as a “Good” and “Simple” person to make others happy (and make my life easier, really). I haven’t always been good. I’ve made mistakes, hurt people, learned lessons too late, etc. And I’m probably “difficult” sometimes (And I mean shit even when I’m not trying to be “difficult,” my autism, Blackness, or some secret third thing makes me perceived as such). But in a world lacking any nuance, I’ve strived towards the path of least resistance — I’m the good guy. I’m a normal, easy-to-work-with person that can sit in the good, wholesome, productive leader box. Until I’m not, then I’m ripped apart, externally and internally, till I can figure out how to get back in my box. 

I think that’s one of the many reasons I like to keep my gender simple and uncomplicated. Taking the path of least resistance. I got the “girl” label and there’s no need to make things troublesome for me or anyone else to change it. Change my email address, websites, organization paperwork, re-introduce myself to professional connections, and more things I haven’t even begun to think of? A headache. Come out to my family in the south? As Trans, AND gay? Hilarious. I’ve got other things to worry about. And it’s not even that uncomfortable. Barely even think about it most days. Gender? That’s other people’s business. I just wear the clothes I got from my mom that I still have from high-school, the random floral Buc-ee’s shirt I got as a gift, the James Blake t-shirts I’ve almost disintegrated from an unknown number of washes, the crop-tops and booty-shorts from that one old white dude I dated (free clothes, how can I complain?). I sport the face I was born with. She/Her? Like half the people I know use those pronouns. It’s very simple, really.

Recently though, I realized it might not be best to revolve my life around people pleasing. Through some meditation, through books, through writing, I’ve found myself faced with unbearable confusion and anxiety in my journey of self-discovery. Why I can stand on a stage in-front of a hundred or so people and yap about work just fine, but lapped around the block 5 times trying to enter a gay bar before giving up, is beyond me (Where did I go after giving up? You guessed it, to the Taco Bell). There’s something indescribably terrifying exiting out of the box of normalcy, conformity, and the routine of being the good, simple, non-intrusive person.

\_\_\_\_

I remember in middle school being afraid to walk in this specific area in the hallway during passing period, because they had these full size mirrors I could see my reflection in. I assumed the unbearable discomfort it brought was because I was “ugly.” And that reminder was depressing, so I avoided it. For a multitude of reasons (Being in predominantly white spaces, not knowing how to do my hair, being undiagnosed Autistic, puberty, being taller than literally everyone including teachers, and so on), I was uncomfortable in my body and being perceived by other people. I assumed “ugly and awkward” as my diagnosis and as the reasoning for my later realized gender and neurotype discomforts.

It was in high-school, when I found my first set of older boyfriends I met online through Minecraft, that I learned that I had something that was desired: femininity. I spent many years attaching my value to the aspects of “womanhood” that were desired by others. My only close relationships were boyfriends, and I was only valued as someone’s “girlfriend.” I wasn’t ugly anymore, and I could get used to what was in the mirror. It couldn’t be that bad? I had something to be happy about, apparently. 

I’m not sure when I first entertained the idea of being trans. I have on a hard-drive somewhere pictures of me in a button up, jeans, and wearing 2 sports bras, sometime in undergrad, just to see what it would feel like to look like that. I remember thinking I looked so ridiculous. I think it’s because those clothes didn’t fit, I could still very clearly see my feminine figure in those skinny jeans, and I had (have) horrendous selfie game. 

I thought about being trans in middle school and high school as well. It’s been on and off throughout much of my post-pubescent life. I remember contemplating and eventually brushing off those thoughts because “I only wanted to be a guy because of trauma,” or something. I hated being perceived as feminine by men, and I hated all the objectification that comes from that. I hated not being able to be friends with and love men without them sexualizing that. And I didn’t want to change gender based on all the societal things that are put on women. I didn’t think that’s why \*actual\* trans people transition.

But I also hate feeling weird around women, feeling like the odd one out. I’ve always wanted to be friends with women, but I’ve felt like an intruder in any group of women I’m in, and I didn’t really have a label for it and didn’t want to explore that embarrassing “I’m not like other girls” feeling. I hate women’s clothes, and I hated feeling weird in the men’s clothing section in Texas, prepping the “I’m shopping for my friend” line I had stashed in case someone asks. I hate my round face in the mirror. I hate having an objectively “good” singing voice, but still hating how it sounded.

I loved the idea of being friends with and having loving relationships with other women as a man. And I loved the thought of being a man loving other men. Not romantic love; I like the idea of being a warm, friendly presence. I feel like “me” on the outside isn’t emanating the “me” on the inside that wants to be that presence with other people. The idea of exploring who I am from a different body — not reserved, unabashedly me, exploring masculinity and even femininity from a “male” slate —made me feel like I could finally not be terrified trying to be seen around people. And I started to shed the ideas of what \*actual\* trans people do and come up with my own reasons for doing.

And I hated my old name. Too feminine sounding. Never liked it. I went by a masc nickname to all my online friends growing up. And now, I loved the thought of finally getting a new name. 

\_\_\_\_

“I can’t do another white name” was my first thought (my birth name is, very white, even though neither parent is). I landed on Trevon. Played with that for a bit. Felt too much like a “name” though. Not sure how to describe that feeling, but that “that’s a name other people have” feeling. I’ve known at least a couple “Trevons/Treys.” I’m not sure if I’m a Trey, too. I was on the phone with my ex, the first person I came out to, as we browsed the list of baby names we would never have (tragic). I played with some names I came across, names I liked the sound of, creating hybrid names (Is that allowed, I thought?). After some playing around in a notes app the day after at some coffee shop on the UES, arrived on Sy’Aire.

Don’t think I’ve ever known anyone with that name, after some Google searches I found it on other baby-name sites, even a ""how to pronounce” YouTube video of its own. It felt very new, “airy”, freeing. I like writing it “syaire” but the capitalization and apostrophe I felt might make it easier to pronounce (I was wrong). Doesn’t have a meaning according to Google. No origin other than being a combination or alternative to other related names. Did I need an origin story? I didn’t know the meaning of my birth name until I Googled it just now actually. Could I create my own meaning? Again… is this allowed?? I panicked as if the name police would come and force me to pick Steve or Kyle or something (and apologies to the Steve and Kyle’s of the world, or anyone else with popular male names, it’s not you, it’s me).

For the next few weeks after, I was “Sy’Aire” in my head. In the Tinder profile I kept impulsively creating and deleting. In my Taco Bell orders. 

New clothes were easy. Fun, even. I never liked femme clothing. Baggy clothes, neutral colors, that felt like me. Big t-shirts, undershirts, great. Boxers? Not there yet, and honestly panties (And let’s pause to say I never liked that word, ever. We need a new gender neutral or just less freaky word for those things. “Panties” for me is my “moist,” I just hate it.) work just fine.

Pronouns were another thing. He/They feels good enough for now. It’s really hard to tell what I want here. Again, I feel like this is an “other people” thing. I’m realizing the discomfort I’ve gotten in the past from accidentally being Sir’d or He'd (I’m abnormally tall, it’s a common mistake until people see my face) is mostly because then they see my face, they do the “Oh! Uh… Ma’am? Sorry,” and it’s awkward and I feel uncomfortable because they’re uncomfortable. “She” honestly feels fine, but if I’m going for \*boy\* then maybe we should retire that one. “He” is a little jarring (I think mostly due to that “oops this is about to be awkward” realization) but maybe I’ll get used to it. “They” is fine but it feels a bit impersonal. And I honestly don’t trust myself at the moment to stick to any neo-pronouns (I keep accidentally mis-pronouning myself and have deadnamed myself like 4 times today).

Female to what, though? Still unsure. Male seems fine. I’m trying to go beyond “fine” though. Fine shouldn’t be my standard anymore. I should probably at least attempt to figure out these things about myself. Still trying to get there though. Still trying to figure out a lot of things actually. Had to phone my cis ex again, to figure out the name of those pants that I like that I see guys wear. “Chinos,” apparently. Not knowing how to dress myself or the names of clothing items I like is apparently, very male. 

Anyways, it’s sigh-AIR. Same amount of syllables as my last name, actually. Really it’s not that hard. And I would like to create my own definition(s) for this name:

I  avoid going a lot out because when my baby isn't sleeping, she's hyperactive and doesn't sit still for a second.

As for my husband, he works until 6. When he comes home, he takes care of the baby for one hour, and then I start the bedtime routine. We only say the basics. As soon as the baby sleeps, he is asleep for a nap, and I wake him up to go out with the dog. After that, either I am very tired or not in the mood, so we sit on the couch and scroll or something like that. Sometimes the baby wakes up every hour, so I have to attend to her as well. Then I go to bed early because I know I have to wake up at 5-6 a.m. with the baby. So I am feeling very lonely, but I cannot blame only others.

I’m a truly hopeless romantic. Give me cliché stuff, gentle romance, quiet nights, cute dates, sharing life with my person, making memories, all that classic relationship stuff. But here comes the tricky bit: I’m asexual. Meaning I’m not up for anything sexual, *ever*. Which, to no surprise, has made my love life a bit challenging. But what's life without a challenge, I guess.

I offer dry humour, teasing as a love language, random info dumps and loads of cuddles. Needless to say, I’d love a partner who accepts my boundaries and is happy without any bedroom activities, so someone with a very low drive, or maybe I’ll really strike it lucky and you’re asexual too! **So, in a nutshell**, I’m looking for a monogamous long term relationship. Easier said than done, being ace, but never say never!

Now, since lists are clear and effective, have some!

**Who I am:**

* 27 years old and from Finland
* obviously childfree since I'm posting here
* atheist and progressive person (liberal, leftie, woke, you get it)
* chubby and short, short dark hair (but it changes, it’s been blue, purple, red…)
* some small tattoos but I dream of a full sleeve
* don’t smoke or drink at all, my only vice is coke zero
* city girl, love culture, museums, theatre, musicals, coffee shops, shopping etc.
* into writing, reading, photography, fashion, city holidays, binging tv shows
* not nerdy but not sporty either
* sadly very allergic to pets

**Who I’m looking for:**

* around my age
* ideally located in Europe
* knows what he wants, emotionally intelligent, honest, humorous

So, you're newly navigating the retirement landscape? Maybe it hit you faster than expected? 🦽 Don't panic! Feeling a bit lost after the sudden stop is *totally* normal. I've been there, trust me. Suddenly, all that free time…what do you *do* with it? Binge-watching Netflix only lasts so long, right? 😉

Thing is, retirement can be *amazing*. It's a chance to rediscover yourself, chase those dreams you put on hold, and, most importantly, *live*! But the key is to do it without feeling like you're emptying the retirement fund faster than you can say ""early bird special.""

Here’s the deal. Staying active, both physically and mentally, is crucial. But how do you do that on a budget? Here are a few ideas that worked for me:

*   **Embrace the great outdoors:** Hiking trails are free! So is walking your neighborhood. Dust off that old bike! Nature is the cheapest (and arguably best) therapist. Remember that beautiful park you always drove past on the way to work? Now's your chance to explore it.
*   **Community Centers are your friend:** Seriously! They often have super affordable classes and activities, from yoga to art workshops. Plus, it's a fantastic way to meet new people! Check out the listings; you might be surprised.
*   **Become a master of bodyweight exercises:** You don’t need fancy gym equipment! Think squats, push-ups (modify on your knees!), planks. There are tons of free videos online to guide you. And speaking of free... **We believe in strongest people.** We made a special freebie guide packed with affordable ways to stay active right at home. Check it out here: [https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts](https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts)
*   **Volunteer!** Give back to your community *and* stay active? Win-win! Animal shelters, food banks, local libraries…they’re all looking for help. It’s a great way to feel purpose and connect with others.
*   **Rediscover a hobby (or find a new one!):** Remember that guitar you bought years ago and never learned to play? Now’s the time! Knitting, painting, gardening…anything that sparks your interest and keeps your mind engaged.
*   **Connect with others!** Loneliness is a real problem in retirement. Join a book club, start a walking group, or just meet up with friends for coffee. Human connection is priceless.

Listen, regaining an active life after retirement isn’t about running marathons (unless that's your thing!). It's about finding joy in the everyday, staying connected, and taking care of yourself, both physically and mentally. It's about designing your *next* chapter, not just passively accepting it.

What activities have you found fulfilling (and budget-friendly!) since retiring? Always curious to hear what keeps you folks energized!",2,1764518135.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

Would love your honest thoughts – especially on pacing and emotional impact.
Thanks for reading!

  We lived under the red star, and the star never blinked.
My name doesn’t matter. In the village they still call me by my father’s name, and that is enough.
I was nine the year the older boy hit me with the pipe.
Third grade, morning shift. Classes ended at 13:30 because the factory needed the mothers and fathers for the second rotation. Four kilometres of cracked asphalt and dust between the school and the block of flats. No buses; petrol belonged to the State. Children walked alone. That was the rule.
He stepped out from the poplars that lined the irrigation canal. Fourteen, maybe fifteen. Eighth-grade uniform, red Pioneer scarf knotted like a noose. He didn’t speak. Just raised the iron pipe—cut-off scaffolding, the kind we stole from collective farms to fix our balconies—and brought it down on the exact same place a guard in Siberia had once broken my grandfather’s skull.
I remember the sun flashing on the metal. Then the world went red. I stayed behind, watching him walk away without a care. Blood mixed with my tears, hands pressed to my head while I asked the empty air, “Why? Why did you hit me? What did I ever do to you?” The feeling of impotence was overwhelming. He was too big, too strong. I cried because I could do nothing else.
I made it home by walking in the ditch so nobody saw the blood. Told my mother I’d fallen off the parallel bars. She looked at me once, saw the lie, and beat me anyway for ruining the shirt. The Party gave us one new shirt every two years, so I had really done it this time.
I never told anyone who did it. Informing was for dogs.
Six years later I was fifteen. The country still wore grey, but the grey had begun to rot at the edges.
The older boys were doing their two years of “patriotic service.” They came home on Sunday passes drunk with power and plum brandy, uniforms too big for the men they hadn’t become. I was buying cigarettes behind the bus station with coins I’d stolen from the factory collection box when I heard his voice—older, thicker, but the same laugh.
He was telling his friend they would meet two girls at the old path above the hidden beach. The path the border guards had stopped patrolling after the minefield was laid farther north. Thirty metres straight down to rocks and black water. I knew every stone. That was the place I grew up—where we hid to smoke, where we made campfires when the militia was someone we knew or just a lazy communist.
Hearing that voice reopened a wound that had never truly closed. That night the rage came back, colder than the day it happened. I remembered my mother’s beatings, and the scar on my scalp still ached. I went down to the basement, took the same kind of pipe (still there, still rusted, heavy and cold), and walked to the cliffs. I hid just metres from the path, crouched in the bushes. Outside it was already dark, and a warm spring wind pushed the salty breath of the Black Sea into my face.
The girls arrived first, scarves pulled low, whispering about university exams they would never be allowed to take. They passed two metres from me and smelled of cheap lilac water.
A few minutes later the boys came along the same path.
I stood up behind them.
The first swing found the exact same place where he had scarred me. He dropped like a sack of maize. His friend screamed once—a thin, useless sound swallowed by the sea—and ran.
I hit until the pipe was soft with hair and the rocks underneath were wet. A strange feeling of freedom and relief surged through me. Blood boiled in my veins. I was not scared. I felt no remorse.
Then I ran.
It was 22:30 when I reached the block. Blood had dried into a second skin, but I hadn’t realised I was covered in it.
My mother opened the door, saw me, and dragged me into the kitchen by the hair. When she realised the blood was not mine, she went quiet—the way people go quiet before a storm. Then she started hitting. Not slaps; closed fists, the way her own father had taught her after crawling back from Siberia missing four toes and all mercy. She used the wooden spoon the Pioneer committee had awarded her for “exemplary ideological education of the child.” She slammed my head against the walls. I felt warm blood running down my back. I didn’t defend myself—she gave me this treatment every week. I only hoped one day she would hit hard enough that I never got up again. Pain had lost all meaning. Life had never had any value for me until that night.
My father came in barefoot, eyes still red from the night shift. He tried to pull her off. She bit his wrist. He struck her once—the way men hit under communism when words are no longer enough. She fell between the table and the stove and stayed there.
The kitchen smelled of blood, coffee, and fear.
My father washed my face in the sink, water running pink into the drain.
“What did you do? Why did she do this? Tell me.”
Fear I had never seen before was painted across his face.
I told him everything. The pipe when I was nine. The laugh behind the bus station. The sound the skull made when it finally gave.
He listened without blinking. Then he sat for five, maybe ten minutes, staring at the blank wall.
“Tell me exactly where this happened. Tell me everything again.”

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I am a novice in espresso and will be buying my first ever machine. My choices are Gaggia Classic Evo Pro (~Rs. 53,000) or Lelit Anna 2 (~Rs. 63,000). I already own a HiBrew G5.

My constraints -

1. Absolutely zero mods.
2. Consistent flavour.
3. One shot espresso and one milk drink at different times of the day.

There are two core contentions between these machines that hold up my decision.

1. PID & Gauge

 The Lelit has both of these. The Gaggia has neither. Is the consistency worth the extra Rs. 10,000? Does pressure feedback affect things materially on every single shot? What is the daily and accumulated long-term penalty for not having PID? Is it frustrating enough for owners of the Gaggia to wish they had spent more?

2. Attachments

 How important is it to stick to the 58mm standard for attachments? Again, keep my disinclination towards modding in mind. The coffee machine is an appliance, not my side-project. If the stock portafilter, tamper and basket are good, then I will drive them into the ground before buying replacements.",1,1764517603.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1palebw,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1palebw/aitah_for_sending_i_still_think_about_you_to_my/,AITAH for sending 'I still think about you' to my ex as a joke and losing everything because my husband's prenup had an infidelity clause?,"My husband found the text before I could delete it and now I'm sitting in a hotel because apparently I signed away everything if I ever cheated.

I sent it as a joke. That's what I keep telling myself. My ex from college and I ended things eight years ago and we haven't spoken since. But last week I was scrolling through old photos on my laptop, found one of us at some beach party, and just had this weird moment. I typed out ""I still think about you sometimes"" and hit send before I could stop myself. Immediately regretted it. He didn't even respond.

My husband (together 5 years, married for 2) was in the shower that morning. I left my phone face-up on the bathroom counter while I went downstairs to make coffee. When I came back up ten minutes later, he was standing in our bedroom, half-dressed, calmly folding shirts into his gym bag.

""What are you doing?"" I asked.

He didn't look at me. Just kept folding. ""Packing.""

""For what?""

That's when he walked over to the nightstand, picked up a manila envelope, and handed it to me. Across the front, in his handwriting: ""Pre-Nup Violation: Read Before I Leave.""

I felt my stomach drop. ""What is this?""

""Open it.""

My hands were shaking. Inside was a copy of our prenuptial agreement with one section highlighted in yellow. I'd signed it two years ago without reading it carefully because my husband came from money and I didn't, and his family's lawyer had presented it as ""standard protection."" The highlighted part said that if either party engaged in infidelity (defined as ""emotional or physical contact with a former or potential romantic partner with intent to rekindle or pursue said relationship""), the unfaithful spouse forfeited all claim to shared assets, spousal support, and any inheritance provisions.

""I wasn't cheating,"" I said. ""It was just a stupid text.""

""To your ex. Saying you still think about him."" He zipped the bag. ""That's pretty clear intent.""

""I didn't mean it like that. I was just, I don't know, feeling nostalgic or something. He didn't even answer.""

""Doesn't matter."" He finally looked at me. His face was completely calm. That's what scared me most. No yelling, no crying, just cold. ""My lawyer already has screenshots. You can stay in the house until the end of the month, then it reverts to me. Car's in my name. Bank accounts were separate per the agreement. You'll get nothing.""

I started crying. ""You're really going to destroy our marriage over one text message?""

""I'm not destroying anything. You did."" He picked up his bag. ""My brother told me you weren't trustworthy. My mom said you were only with me for money. I defended you. I told them you loved me.""

""I do love you!""

""Then why the hell would you text him?"" His voice finally cracked a little. ""We just celebrated our anniversary last month. You told me I was everything you ever wanted. Was that a lie?""

""No. This was just a moment of stupidity. Please.""

He walked past me toward the door. I grabbed his arm and he pulled away so fast I stumbled.

""Don't touch me."" He was calm again. Scary calm. ""I'll have someone come get the rest of my things next week. Don't contact me. Any communication goes through my attorney.""

""Who's your attorney?"" I asked, because I couldn't think of anything else to say.

""My cousin. The one who wrote the prenup."" He opened the bedroom door. ""The one I specifically told you specialized in infidelity clauses. The one you smiled at and thanked for 'keeping things simple.'""

He left. I heard his car start in the driveway and then he was gone.

I called him seventeen times. Texted him over and over apologizing, explaining, begging. Nothing. I called my sister and she said I was an idiot for texting an ex while married. I called my mom and she asked why I didn't read the prenup more carefully. I called my best friend and she said ""well, technically you did emotionally cheat, even if you didn't mean to follow through.""

Three days later I got served with divorce papers. His lawyer included printouts of the text, a timeline of our marriage, and a request for me to vacate the house by the 30th. I looked up tenant rights and apparently because my name isn't on the deed and the prenup specifies I have no claim to the property, I have no legal standing to stay.

I'm in a hotel now using money from my own savings account (thank god I kept one). I make okay money as a teacher but not enough to afford anything close to the neighborhood we lived in. I'll have to move back in with my parents at 34 years old because I sent one drunk text at 9 in the morning to someone I haven't seen in almost a decade.

My ex finally texted me back yesterday. He said ""Sorry, I don't think about you. Happily engaged. Please don't contact me again."" So that's great.

My husband's family is already talking about the divorce on social media. His mom posted something about ""gold diggers finally showing their true colors"" with a photo of her and my husband at some charity event. I'm blocked so I only know because my sister showed me.

I don't know what I expected. That he'd cool off? That we'd talk it out? He won't even look at the texts I send. His number might be blocked now, actually. They just say ""delivered"" but never ""read.""

The worst part is I genuinely didn't mean anything by it. It was a stupid, thoughtless moment. I wasn't planning to meet up with my ex. I wasn't trying to start something. I just typed it out and sent it like an idiot. But apparently that doesn't matter. Intent doesn't matter. The prenup is ironclad according to the two lawyers I've consulted, both of whom told me I'm screwed.

My family thinks I'm getting what I deserve for being careless. His family thinks I'm a cheater who got caught. I'm starting to wonder if I really did emotionally cheat without realizing it. Maybe I wanted something from my ex, some validation or confirmation that I mattered to him once. Maybe that is cheating.

I don't know anymore. Am I the asshole for thinking this punishment doesn't fit the crime? Or did I actually do something unforgivable and I'm just too selfish to see it?

1pal9hs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pal9hs,How to create Filter-Gallery inside a detailed page CMS,"Hi everyone,

I’m building a website in Framer and I need some guidance on creating filters inside a detailed page (so, inside a single CMS item of my “Spaces” collection).

For example, in the “Living” page, I’d like to have filter buttons at the top (e.g., “Armchairs,” “Sofas,” “Tables,” “Chairs”). When I click on one of them, the gallery below should update to show only the images related to that filter. I’ve attached screenshots for reference.

Also, for pages like “Bathrooms,” where there are no subcategories or filters, how should this be handled? Is there a way to make it dynamic so that the gallery still works even without filters?

Any advice on how to achieve this in Framer would be greatly appreciated.

I have already created the galleries and assigned to the relative category, I want to display the categories on the fornitures inside its specific area.

I (27F) have always had issues with my narcissistic, manipulative and abusive father but today was my last straw. My mom has been sick for the past week and now I'm taking care of all the household chores. So I got both my parents coffee when he started calling me multiple times to get him random things from around the house, and because I got so tired, I told my younger sibling to go fetch him whatever that he wants because my legs started to get tingly (I have PID). That's when he started yelling at me for saying that to my sibling and threw the coffee cup across the room and started calling me names and praying for my downfall and how I'm an irresponsible piece of shit. I know he's going to emotionally and verbally abuse me for the next two months but is it weird that I genuinely don't care about him even if he doesn't talk to me till I die? It's always been like this and living with him in the same house where he thinks he controls everyone and they should feed him in the mouth is mental torment. ",20,1764517193.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False
1pal98g,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pal98g/i_am_41m_and_she_is_27f/,I am 41m and she is 27f,"Me and a girl have been writing to each other every day  for almost 4yrs. We have a long distance relationship. We know what each other look like and we send each other photos everyday. 

  
One day when I was on vacation, I sent her photos on my vacation and she said the 3 words to me and i wrote it back. After we finished writing, I went to the pool and was copying everything another girl did with, then later i wrote  another post asking if she wants to go get coffee.. Later I deleted the post and carried on. 

  
There was no reply but I did see her again and didnt talk to her or anything. 

  
After that, me and the long distance girl continued writing each other and everything was okay or at least i thought it was. This year, i asked her if she wanted to take the sexual step with me. She said yes. But when we did send sexy photos I never asked to see more and we never truly finished, it was like she was teasing me. But I would send her blanket photos maybe way to many even when she was sick. So then halfway through this year, I decided to go to her facebook and i found out she got engaged… 

  
Normally every man‘s response would be shocked and hurt. But my reaction was neither. and I didn’t bring it up but when i didn’t bring it up, my writing to her was strange then 4 weeks later she asks if everything was okay then i bring it up but not angrily or jealous then i write to her congratulations in writing and on her facebook. She writes saying she did it because she doesn’t want to be alone and he started rand writing to him. 

A month later, i go to a porn site and i start giving my money to the model.. When that started, once again my writing became strange and i started acting strange. 2 months later i confessed to her what i was doing and she was hurt and thought i was going to replace her. 

So then, i decided to stop with the porn   model and write only to the long distance girl. For awhile it was okay and calm until just recently my writing is a little strange and started yet again with writing to another online porn model.. 

  
So my question is: what’s really happening here? why do I need to go to porn? 

  
side note: since she got engaged, all things sexual with her has stopped.  

  
Oh and i can’t write to her ‘it’s over’ because she has a lot of on her plate plus her mum is sick, her work is hard, plus now before Christmas would not be a thing to do.

1pal910,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pal910/was_i_being_too_needy_about_locking_down_a_date/,Was I being too needy about locking down a date or was his rant completely overblown? I can't tell anymore.,"I (F30) hit it off with a guy on Bumble (M31) who seemed perfect on paper to me - tall, handsome, tatted, nerdy, musically-inclined, intelligent, insanely great sense of humour, noticed small details, asked questions, listened intently to my yap and even yapped more than me! Honestly it felt like I was talking to someone who matched both my freak and yearn in equal measure. You could've told me it was my first day on the planet with the way I was in complete awe.

He was extremely keen on a date from day one but pinning down a day on both of our calendars was proving tricky for him due to the nature of his work; I work a steady 9-5, he freelances. A few days into our messaging, he was getting frustrated with how busy work was and suggested a quick coffee/park walk, just to make sure we could meet soon. I agreed so it was an easy out if we decided we didn't vibe as well in person. Then he changed his mind and said he'd move things around so we could hang out properly, which I thought was sweet. And any time we spoke and something activity-related came up, he kept saying ""another date idea, hell yeah, let's do it"" and made it clear he didn't want to talk too long before meeting. And any time he kept sensing I was being careful (I'm one of those too-much kinda lover girls), he assured me this was a safe space and encouraged me to be myself, as open, honest, weird and insane as that person was. He absolutely shit on the last guy who broke my heart over the summer and convinced me he was different. Silly me!

Anyway, the days I kept free for him this week were coming and going and on the last day we spoke (Thursday), I really needed some confirmation so I could decide whether to work in the office or WFH (Friday, one of the half-days I had kept free). He told me he couldn't do Friday anymore or the weekend but good news, he was free all of next week and free as a bird. I told him to pick a day and joked that my friends will tell me to ""drop that mf"" otherwise. He wasn't happy about that comment. It was in jest and he gave me as much sass as I gave him so I really really didn't think it was a big deal.

I (over-)explained that I was just being facetious because of my anxiety and I couldn't leave it alone, even though my friends were telling me to. And I added that generally unsurety/I'll-let-you-knows can appear like a no and I didn't mean him specifically, but more from experience and even I was guilty of it sometimes! But not to worry because it was ultimately a poorly-phrased joke and that I was more than happy to plan everything since he's so busy and stressed. I said leave it to me and I asserted that the important thing was locking down a day otherwise I would assume he wasn't interested in going out anymore and if that was the case, then that was also okay! I just didn't want a penpal. And wished him a good day at work and said we could talk about it later. 

I admit my joke could have been interpreted as a jab and my assertiveness was perhaps too pushy. But I was laughing throughout my voice note and being my usual silly self. And given what he said about being honest, I mistakenly thought ""okay, I should be able to express my needs for once without having a panic attack. He likes it when I'm sassy, he finds it cute. It'll be fine..."" especially if we've both established we like each other and want to see each other multiple times! 

Cue a 4-min rant over voice note, claiming I was calling him a liar, calling him a false person who doesn't keep his word, that he's a grown man, too old for this, he's not a child, that I'm making up scenarios and acting crazy. That the entire thing was insane and he couldn't believe what I was saying and where it was coming from. That he's always been honest with me and that my behaviour was very very strange. And that he didn't want to talk to me because he was so pissed off and angry. He repeated this over and over and over, completely and utterly maniacal and angry...enough to fill 4 minutes of audio. 

The transcript I generated attests to the length. The rising tone in his voice scared me. And I don't get scared easily! I'm a big girl. Eldest daughter. I yell at my dad, haha. 
But of course, me being me and having childhood trauma and abandonment issues to a tee, took a half hour to process this and then sent a grovelling voice note back, apologising for everything. I explained I wasn't attacking his character at all. I suggested taking a time out and talking about it properly later. He then blocked me. I was able to reach out the next day from somewhere else in an effort to patch things up and apologise but he left me on read. I've deleted his number since because all my dignity is out the window. 

It's just an absolute shame because I rarely ever get on like a house on fire with anyone. Especially in terms of personality, family history, humour etc. I'm lucky if I meet someone I like once every few years! 
I keep flip-flopping between laughing and crying at the sheer absurdity of it all. My heart is telling me I fucked this up but my head is telling me he overreacted.

Let's hope December doesn't come with any more plot twists because I am EXHAUSTED of swiping through apps endlessly. 

Can you please slap some sense into me and stop the spiral?

Started getting into Japanese green tea about a year ago because I wanted to cut down on coffee. Bought some sencha from the Asian supermarket, chucked boiling water on it, drank it while scrolling my phone. Job done.

Fast forward to last month when I was watching this documentary about traditional tea houses in Kyoto, and it properly hit me  I've been treating tea like instant coffee. The whole point is that it's meant to be a ritual, not just chugging caffeine while multitasking.  
Started doing some reading about 茶道 (sadō) and the philosophy behind it. Even for everyday tea drinking (not formal tea ceremony), there's this whole mindfulness aspect I'd completely ignored. The preparation, the temperature, the breathing, actually sitting and appreciating it instead of drinking it while checking emails.

Decided to properly commit to it. Got some decent organic genmaicha from  (Yame region stuff), and now I actually take fifteen minutes in the morning to prepare it properly. Measure the leaves, heat the water to the right temp, let it steep correctly, sit and actually drink it without my phone.  
Sounds pretentious written out like this, but honestly? It's changed my entire morning. Feel way calmer starting the day. The tea tastes completely different too when you're not rushing it.

Anyone else had this realisation? That Japanese tea culture isn't just about the drink itself but the whole process around it?

1pal737,https://i.redd.it/iykzxyxuxe4g1.png,My mom hit me so hard it left a bruise because I didn't sufficiently scrub the counters after cooking Thanksgiving dinner. Corn beef hash and eggs.,"In my defense, the restaurant I had called to inquire about doing takeout from that day apparently lied to me, so I had to scramble to cook something up with what was in the house.

Ended up throwing together eggs, bacon, canned corn beef hash and some frozen hash browns to flesh it out into a halfway passable meal.

I was so exhausted from scrubbing down the stovetop that I forgot to clean up the coffee my mom had spilled during the night that I hadn't seen. (I don't drink coffee).

The next day my mom sent me a massive wall of text about ""broken promises"" and that she was crying at how horrible and lazy I am. When I got home the next day from studying and applying for jobs, she demanded to show me how to clean the counter while screaming and cursing, and when I tried to walk away she struck me with her fists and cane so hard it left a bruise.

Meanwhile, I have nowhere to go -- I am pretty highly educated, but I'm also on the autistic spectrum and have been struggling with discrimination -- I was recently terminated after attempting to present paperwork from my doctor and begin the interactive process. It's been long enough looking for work in my IT niche that I'm starting a job with no relevance to my degree this coming week, but I have very little savings.

I'm very upset -- when I first moved home, my dad would chase me around the house with a gun until he had me cornered then hurl insults at me. He's in an Alzheimer's facility, but my mom seems to have picked up where he left off... we originally agreed I could stay if I did things like take out the trash, feed and water the bird, do the dishes, but then she started demanding I do medical tasks like put her shoes on... while refusing to wake before noon. She abuses benzos, then pounds coffee and by the end of the day she's in a borderline manic state. She stays up until about 6-8am then sleeps for about five hours then wakes up and walks around the house crying that she is ""so busy"" and how lazy I am.

(Because I don't want to sit around until between 11 and 2 to put her shoes on and bringing her candies and coffees instead of trying to study for certs or apply to jobs in my field)

I've spoken to domestic violence hotlines, but... it's her house. It sounds like best case scenario, she'd get a DV conviction but be within her rights to evict me, and I'd be homeless.

So... whether it's at school, at work, or at home, I am abused and told that if I had money maybe I could get help (apparently I could hire a lawyer if I had some) but since no one wants to stop discriminating long enough for me to practice my trade, I can't.

So I sit in the corner of a coffeeshop and resist the urge to use my skills for evil.

Daisy Shaw

Everyone in Chicago knew Ryland Pickwick, the notorious arms dealer, was a loose cannon.

He was bloodthirsty, cruel, and he loved to hold a blood-stained dagger to his opponent's throat whenever he played cards.

Lately, a rich man's illegitimate daughter caught his fancy, and their wedding was set for next week.

My fiancé, Harrison Pickwick, caught wind of it and disappeared for three days.

When I finally tracked him down, I overheard his conversation with his right-hand man.

""On the wedding day, deploy all our men to keep Anna safe and send Judy over in her place.

""I can't let Anna marry that psycho. Every woman he toyed with ended up broken.""

His right-hand man muttered, ""Rest assured, boss. It's all fixed.

""But... What about Ms. Hansen? If Ryland discovers that the bride has been switched, will he...""

Harrison snorted.

""What's there to be afraid of? He wouldn't dare to touch my girl.

""After the heat dies down, I'll divorce Anna and hold a fancier wedding for Judy.""

I stood outside, frozen to the core.

Turned out the love of my life had fallen for someone else.

I decided to go along with his plan. Yet once the swap was made, Harrison broke into tears.

***

After Harrison finished speaking, a woman's quiet sobs echoed through the private room.

Only then did I notice Anabella Ridgeway's presence. She sank into the leather sofa, her eyes rimmed with red, like a frightened kitty.

""Harry, it's not worth the risk! Ryland Pickwick is gonna kill you...""

Harrison brushed her tears away with his fingertip, his voice sweeter than honey. ""Rest assured. Fear is never in my dictionary.""

Then he chuckled, slipped his arm around her waist, and pulled her in. ""If you wanna thank me, just give me a bunch of kids.""

The people in the room instantly erupted in cheers and whistles.

Anabella's face flushed red as she buried her head into Harrison's arms.

""But, what about Ms. Hansen?""

""Judith?"" Harrison tittered. ""She's crazy about me. Even if she finds out, she'll forgive me after a few sweet nothings.""

His men chimed in, ""Mr. Pickwick is right! Ms. Hansen never says no to him!

""She wouldn't mind such a trifle.""

""Yeah. Everyone knows that she's hell-bent on marrying Mr. Pickwick.""

""Mr. Pickwick, you're so lucky. You get to marry the sweet Anabella, and the elegant Ms. Hansen is also waiting to be your bride.

""I wonder who you prefer, though.""

Harrison didn't respond. He pulled out a velvet box from his suit pocket, revealing a ruby ring.

It was the Pickwick family's heirloom, handed down to every bride through generations.

Under everyone's gaze, Harrison slid the ring onto Anabella's ring finger.

His action was enough to prove his determination to marry her.

Taken aback, Anabella tried to pull away, but he held her tightly.

""Since you will walk down the aisle with me, this ring belongs to you.""

Then he rubbed the ring and whispered, ""Don't let Judith see it. She may be compliant, but she's perceptive and paranoid.""

I stood outside the door, gazing at the ring, a bitter smile tugging at my lips.

Harrison's mother gave me that ring on her deathbed. It was a symbol of the Pickwick family's century-long heritage

Since we weren't officially married, I felt it was improper to wear it.

But three days ago, Harrison showed up at my apartment at midnight, saying he needed the ring for the ceremony.

So I opened the safe and gave him that ring.

I never once expected that the ceremony was meant for someone else.

I dashed out the door, straight into the pouring rain.

Bullets of rain pelted my body, wrenching my mind back to the night seven years ago.

My family and the Pickwicks had been close for generations.

Later, when they got into trouble, my father often secretly gave them financial help.

One day, the Pickwicks' sworn enemies found us. My mother hid me in the basement.

I could do nothing but watch as they brutally murdered my parents.

My father's blood squirted in my eyes, blurring my vision.

When reinforcements from the Pickwick family arrived, Harrison was the first to find me.

I bit him and kicked him like crazy, my nails raking his arm and leaving trails of blood. But he held me tightly until I blacked out, like he couldn't feel the pain.

In the wake of the upheaval, Hector Pickwick, Harrison's father, took me in and raised me out of gratitude.

Harrison brought me wherever he went. He saved me from the nightmares that haunted me and the vengeful rage that had once consumed me.

I grew deeply attached to him. I went to school and trained with him, stuck by him through thick and thin.

I thought we would stand by each other forever, never expecting that someone else would take my place.

If that was what he wanted, I would honor his choice.

When Harrison left the club, the rain was still falling. I had been sitting in the lobby the whole time.

The moment he caught sight of me, he let go of Anabella's hand, sprang behind me, and covered my eyes like he did when we were teens.

""Guess who I am.""

I yanked his hand away. ""It's not fun.""

With a chuckle, he casually draped his arm over my shoulder and caressed my cheek.

""Look at you, so ballsy! Aren't you afraid it'll be some perv?""

I said nothing, my gaze sweeping over Anabella and the troop of men behind him.

They didn't seem to worry that I had seen what just happened at all.

Because they knew I would always compromise with Harrison.

Harrison stepped between us, obscuring my sight. ""Did you come here looking for me?""

I nodded. ""The rain was heavy. I came here to take shelter.""

He took my hand like he'd done a million times, rubbing it in his palms to warm it up.

""You said you liked that exclusive Tiffany diamond bracelet, right? I forgot to tell you that I made a special trip to Los Angeles to get it for you.""

""Where's the bracelet then?"" I asked.

He cast Anabella a glance. ""It's a custom piece. I made a few tweaks to the design. So ... it won't be finished until the wedding's over.""

I forced a smile but said noth

While waiting for the car, Anabella suddenly let out a cry-her bracelet had hooked onto a nearby ornament.

With a forceful tug, the bracelet snapped and hit the marble ground, shining diamonds scattering in all directions.

It was the exact bracelet that I yearned for. There were only three in the world. I had mentioned it to Harrison several times.

He never bothered to buy it for me, and now, it was actually on someone else's wrist.

In a panic, Anabella crouched to pick them up, but a splinter of diamond cut her finger.

""Ouch!""

Blood oozed out. Harrison immediately released me and strode toward her.

""How can you be so careless?""

He swiftly removed his suit jacket and placed it over Anabella's shoulder. Then he used his tie to staunch the flow of blood.

I had given Harrison that tie as a birthday gift. He treasured it and treated it with meticulous care. Yet now, it was smeared with blood.

When he caught me staring, a shadow of guilt crossed his face.

""Judy, I'll take Anna to the clinic. You go in. I'll be back to get you.""

Before I could answer, he half-carried Anabella and climbed into the car.

To ease the tension, his men chimed in, ""Ms. Ridgeway helped Mr. Pickwick before. So he's returning the favor. Don't take it to heart. Do you want us to

give you a ride?""

I shook my head and told them to leave.

I just wanted to see if Harrison would keep his promise.

The night fell. Even when Hector called me and urged me to come home, Harrison was still nowhere in sight.

The next morning, he rushed into the villa. Seeing me sitting at the dining table set his mind at ease.

""Sorry, Judy. The car had a blowout. We were in the middle of nowhere with no phone signal. That's why I couldn't make it back for you."" 

I didn't listen to a single word he said.

My gaze was locked onto the hickey on his neck.

I reached for it, as though to expose his lies, but Harrison recoiled, adjusting the awkward scarf higher.

I looked down, digging my nails into my palm to fight back the tears.

""Your scarf looks out of place. I'll fix it for you.""

""No!"" He jumped at my words, then quickly changed the topic. ""Speaking of which, don't you need a diamond for the wedding veil? Let's go to the jewelry store and choose it now.""

As he spoke, he hurried to the car and waited for me.

I chuckled bitterly, tears rolling down my face.

By the time I changed clothes and stepped outside, the scarf was neatly fastened around his neck.

As the car pulled up to the jewelry store, a commotion reached us from inside.

I looked up at the VIP room on the second floor, and through the glass, I saw Anabella again.

Her face was streaked with tears, and a circle of rich women pushed and shoved her.

Harrison clenched his fists, his jaw tight, his gaze fixed on the second floor.

But he fought his urge to bolt upstairs and turned his gaze toward me.

I knew he wanted me to save Anabella's skin again.

This wasn't the first time.

Quite a few socialites didn't see eye to eye with Anabella.

Once, Anabella got pushed into the pool. Harrison jumped in and rescued her.

Afterwards, whenever she was in a jam, Harrison would always bail her out.

If he couldn't make an appearance, he let me handle it.

After the word got out that the casino tycoon, Ryland Pickwick, was going to marry Anabella, those ladies Fold Up green with envy. 

To catch Ryland's attention, they wouldn't hesitate to do plastic surgery and insert breast implants.

""Are you deaf? Take your clothes off! Let's see how big those titties are to enthrall the famous Ryland.""

""Please, don't do this. People are watching us.""

Anabella shook her head, tears gushing.

""Drop the innocent act! There's no way Ryland would know you got the goods if you hadn't flaunted them.

""If he can see them, why can't we?

""Will you take it off yourself, or should we help you?""

When Anabella was driven into a corner, Harrison nudged me.

""Judy, go!""

I staggered and almost fell.

But he was utterly fixated on Anabella and didn't notice that at all.

With a self-mocking curl of my lips, I headed to the second floor.

Seeing me, Anabella scuttled behind me and whispered shakily, ""Ms. Hansen, help...""

I glanced at the bullies and bellowed, ""How dare you make her strip in public? Aren't you afraid of being on tomorrow's front page?""

The leader, Elsie Thorp, smiled at me indifferently. ""Ms. Hansen, we're just curious. But take my advice, saint, either."" 

The leader, Elsie Thorp, smiled at me indifferently. ""Ms. Hansen, we're just curious. But take my advice, she's no saint, either.""

""Yeah, Ms. Hansen. I saw Mr. Pickwick take her to the hotel a few days ago. Isn't that suspicious?""

Anabella shook her head frantically.

""No! Ms. Hansen, don't listen to their nonsense!""

He clutched my arm and pulled me back. I couldn't break free even if I tried.

""Nonsense? You just don't have the guts to admit it!

""Yesterday, I even saw you two enter...""

Before she could finish, Anabella screamed and tumbled backward over the railing!

""Anna!""

Harrison lunged forward and caught her. They crashed to the ground together.

""Anna, are you all right? Did you get hurt?""

It took Anabella a moment to recover from the shock. She slowly looked up at me, tears pouring. ""Ms. Hansen, why did you push me? Did you really believe their lies?""

Harrison lifted his head, his gaze sharp and cold.

""Judith! I asked you to save her, not the other way around!""

Catching the flicker of satisfaction in Anabella's eyes, I suddenly understood why she had been pulling my arm.

""She jumped herself.""

She hung her head, her eyes rimmed with red, and she said timidly, ""It's my fault. I fell by accident...""

She trembled all over, looking pitiful and vulnerable.

Harrison cradled her, his heart full of sympathy.

""I saw everything clearly from below! You nudged her! And you still try to deny it?""

Meeting his scornful eyes, I realized that arguing was pointless.

Anabella staged the whole scene herself, and he wouldn't believe a word I said.

""If anything happens to her, I will never forgive you.""

With that, he ignored everyone, scooped Anabella up in his arms, and strode out of the jewelry store.

Before leaving, Anabella raised her brows at me and smiled triumphantly. I wasn't the only one who saw that smile. Elsie and her friends saw it, too.

Gnashing her teeth, Elsie thundered, ""That bitch! I knew she did it on purpose!

""Ms. Hansen, Mr. Pickwick is engaged to you. How dare she go after him? Don't you...""

She left the rest unsaid, probably convinced by those rumors that I was spineless.

Back at the villa, before I could even take a seat, Harrison stormed in.

He seized my wrist and dragged me toward the door. ""Anna is in the hospital because of you. Go apologize.""

I jerked my hand free and met his cold eyes.

""I said I didn't push her. Why should I apologize?""

""I believe what I saw. Judy, don't test my patience.""

With that, he produced my father's ring, the only keepsake I had of him.

When we got engaged, I gave it to him as a token of our love. It was the thing that I cherished most.

My heart sank as a chill ran through me.

""You're gonna threaten me 

""Not threaten. As long as you apologize, everything will go back to the way it was.""

I laughed, tears rolling down my cheeks.

I looked away, quickly wiped my tears, and swallowed hard. ""Fine. I'll go. But once I apologize, give me back my ring.""

Harrison paused. He opened his mouth, but the words died in his throat. In the end, he gave a reluctant nod.

Anabella was placed in the Pickwick family's private hospital. She was now curling up in the bed and weeping quietly.

The sight of me gave her quite a start.

""I'm sorry.""

After saying that, I stared at Harrison.

He held Anabella by the shoulders and said coldly, ""Apologize on your knees.""

I gawked at him in disbelief, my heart desolate.

I sank to my knees and repeated the words. ""I'm sorry.""

Anabella tried to rise from the bed as if to help me up, but Harrison stopped her.

""She owes you an apology. Rest up. Nothing can go wrong at the wedding.""

He didn't even bother to lie.

I stood up, snatched the ring from his hand, and turned to leave.

No matter how he shouted my name, I marched ahead, steadfast.

We hadn't come across each other again until the wedding day.

After all the formalities, he sent me into the wedding car and whispered, ""No matter what happens, don't freak out. I'll come to get you later.""

I stayed quiet.

After circling the city, the car suddenly stopped on the bridge.

About ten minutes later, it started moving again.

But I sensed the route had changed. It didn't head to the Pickwick's villa, but to Ryland's manor in the south.

When the car halted, my heart clenched.

As Hector's illegitimate son, Ryland was never acknowledged by the family and grew up in the slums.

He was ruthless. He clawed his way up from the bottom, conquered, and took over several rival gangs.

Feared by every gangster, he became known as the ""King of Gambling.""

I had met him a few times. He always struck me as cold and unapproachable.

As the car door opened, he looked at me without a trace of surprise. Instead, he flashed a grin and asked, ""You're here? Are you hungry?""

""Why weren't you surprised to see me?""

""Were you not the same?""

I was so nervous that I forgot to pretend.

Ryland chuckled. ""Do you want to go back to Harrison?""

I shook my head.

""From now on, you're my wife.""

Hand in hand, we walked up the red carpet. The wedding eclipsed the one the Pickwick family held, but the guests were surprisingly sparse.

Most were his brothers from the gang.

During the ceremony, Ryland kissed me. I didn't resist and let him deepen the kiss.

That night, he claimed me like a ravenous beast. His thirst was almost unquenched.

His hot breath grazed my ear as I whimpered and attempted to run, but he gripped my ankle and hauled me back.

All night, no matter how I begged, he refused to stop.

Not until the sun rose did he pat my back and coax me to sleep.

Yet I had barely closed my eyes when I heard Harrison's furious roar. ""Already married? That's a load of bull!""

He kicked the door open and stormed in.

Harrison charged into the bedroom, his eyes blazing red. ""Ryland! Where's my wife? I'm taking her home!""

Ryland swiftly wrapped me in the blanket and stood before the bed.

""What's your problem? Shouldn't your wife be at home? Stop making a scene here!""

""There was a mix-up yesterday! Judith was sent to you! Where is she? Which room?""

Seeing Harrison so anxious, Ryland smirked and deliberately revealed the scratch marks on his back.

Harrison's eyes widened in shock as he fixated on the scratch marks. ""You...""

His words were caught in his throat, his heart raced, and his gaze wandered to the giant bed draped in dark curtains.

""My wife sleeps in my bed. Duh! Who would put their wife in the guest room?""

Harrison's lips quivered. He couldn't force a single word out.

I chimed in at the right moment, my voice raspy from sleep. ""Sweetheart, who's there?""

That came like a bolt from the blue, and Harrison staggered, almost losing his balance.

The butler rushed to steady Harrison, but Harrison shoved him aside. He hissed, ""Piss off! Don't touch me!""

Harrison snapped his head toward Ryland and glared at him. ""Ryland! You know what she means to me! How dare you defile her?

""Judy, it's me! Talk to me, Judy! Did he force you?""

He lunged forward, but Ryland kicked him in the stomach. He grunted and stumbled backward.

""Harrison, don't flip out on me!""

Ryland's words dripped with disdain.

""Besides, you know who's behind this, don't you?""

Harrison gritted his teeth, his eyes burning with fury. ""You've known it all along?""

Ryland offered no reply, only a cold smirk playing on his lips.

""Get out!""

""I won't leave without her!""

Harrison lunged forward again, grappling with Ryland. Both went for the kill. Within moments, Harrison's face was marked with bruises and blood.

By the time I threw on my robe and rushed out, Ryland had already pinned Harrison against the wall, twisting his arm behind his back.

But the moment Harrison saw me, he thrashed violently. ""Judy! Judy, come here! I'll take you home!""

His eyes sparkled with a feverish mix of hope and desperation, as if he truly cared about me.

I watched him serenely. ""What about Anabella? What do you plan to do with her?""

Harrison's smile vanished.

""Last time, I was drunk. I mistook her for you. It was too late.

""But I'll take care of it! You're the only woman I'll ever call wife! I'll make her move out. She won't come between us again!""

I cut him short. ""That won't be necessary. I won't go back.""

""Nonsense!""

He snapped, ""How am I going to tell my father? And my mother? Before she passed, she entrusted that family heirloom to...""

I laughed bitterly. ""What's the point of telling me this now? Didn't you put that ruby ring on Anabella's finger yourself?""

Harrison blanched. He didn't expect me to know this.

""The night at the casino, I heard everything, yet I still played along with you. Call it even now.

""You should leave.""

Words failed him. He finally realized why I had been acting strangely over the past few days.

I walked up to Ryland, touched the split corner of his lips, and asked softly, ""Does it hurt? I'll fetch the first-aid kit.""

He grabbed my wrist. When he was about to lead me back to the room, Hector and his men arrived. 

Seeing me with Ryland, Hector turned livid. His finger trembled as he pointed at Ryland. ""Brat! That's your sister-in-law! How could you? Alas!""

Hector's presence gave Harrison some hope. He shouted, ""Dad, dad! Judy is my wife! She should be mine!""

""Don't worry. I'll set this right for you!""

I looked at Ryland. Though his face registered composure, his hands behind him were clenched.

I gently took his hand and met Hector's gaze. ""Sir, Harrison orchestrated this to marry Anabella. It has nothing to do with Ryland.""

""What? What are you talking about?"" Hector was clearly in the dark, convinced it was all by Ryland's design.

I added, ""If you don't believe me, you can check with Anabella and see if she's wearing the Pickwick family's ruby ring.""

Hector shot Harrison a glare. ""Is that true? Did you do it?""

Harrison closed his eyes and sank to his knees.

""Yes, it was all my doing. I can't bear to watch Anna marry a degenerate like Ryland! That's why I went to such lengths!

""But Judy, I have never given up on you! Come back with me now, and we can sweep this under the rug!""

As soon as he finished talking, Hector kicked him hard.

""Bastard! That marriage was arranged long ago! How dare you mess it up!""

Hector turned to me and said, ""But good thing that no one knows it yet. Judy, come home with us. I'll make it up to you!

""I'll send that Anabella away immediately and right all the wrongs done to you!""

Hector's plea felt genuine. He truly wanted me back. For all these years, he had been treating me like his future daughter-in-law.

Noticing my silence, Ryland tightened his grip, as if afraid I might say yes.

No way I would do that.

""Sir, forgive me, but Ryland is also your son. I'm willing to marry him.""

""My dear, don't talk nonsense! He's nothing but an illegitimate son. How could he ever be good enough for you?""

""But I'm just an orphan. You took me in out of your kindness. Since Harrison carries a torch for Anabella, I'll let them be together. It's for the best.""

Hector sighed, staring daggers at Harrison, then kicked him again. ""Brat! Look what you have done!

""Before this blows out of proportion, get rid of that girl right now!""

The butler chimed in, ""I'm afraid it's too late. The news has traveled far and wide.""


""What?"" Harrison jerked his head up, bewildered.

He had originally planned to bring me back and leak the news to humiliate Ryland.

But now, things had gotten out of hand. He might never get the chance to bring me back.

It wasn't until this moment that he completely lost his bearings.

Watching me holding hands with Ryland, he kept shaking his head, tears streaming down his face. ""No, Judy! You can't stay here! You can't!

""If you don't leave now, there will be no turning back!""

I stayed quiet, rubbing my temples and whispering to Ryland, ""Sweetheart, my head hurts. I'd like to return to our room and lie down.""

Ryland gestured for the maid to escort me out.

""Judy! Judy!"" Harrison wanted to follow, but the bodyguard stopped him cold.

Frustrated, Hector shot Ryland a stare and said austerely, ""Get your brother back now!""

No matter how fiercely Harrison fought, it was all in vain.

That evening, while I tended to Ryland's wounds, he furrowed his brows and seemed to have a lot on his mind.

I turned to fetch the first-aid kit, but he pulled me back and had me sit on his lap.

His spontaneous action caught me off guard, leaving me unsure what to do.

Just as I was about to rise, he murmured, ""Seven years ago, I was the one who found you first, not Harrison.""

I was utterly dumbfounded. ""What did you just say?""

He rolled up his sleeve, revealing a tooth-bite-shaped old scar on his forearm.

I touched the scar with shaky fingers, my heart hammering in my chest. ""How could it be you?""

""Back then, I had just made a name for myself in underground boxing, but Hector summoned me back to work for him. I was the first to break into your house that night.

""I carried you out of the basement.

When you asked my name, I didn't tell you.

""I didn't think that you would mistake me for Harrison.""

I frowned slightly and examined Ryland's face, my finger gently tracing the scar beneath his brow.

I had long noticed that Harrison had no scar on his face, and I figured that I remembered it wrong.

""That'll explain it. Whenever I ask Harrison about that night, he always gives me the runaround. I thought he was trying to spare my feelings. It turned out he didn't know.

""Why didn't you tell me the truth later?""

He replied, ""You were certain it was him, and you liked him so much. I didn't see the point of bringing it up. Besides, it was just a brief encounter in the chaos.""

I slowly shook my head, cupped his face, and met his gaze. ""No, it's not. If you hadn't found me that night, I would have died in that basement.""

He held the back of my head, pulled me close, and kissed me affectionately.

But then, I gently pushed him back, my voice tinged with a hint of curiosity and jealousy. ""But, why did you marry Anabella?""

Seeing my stern face, Ryland chuckled.

""That was just an excuse to brush off those people trying to set me up with a date.

""As for Anabella, she shares a past with Harrison. Now, with your wedding coming up, I can't just sit back and do nothing.

""So, I thought I would test Harrison. See how he will respond if I ask to marry Anabella.

""To my surprise, he pulled a switcheroo, so I played his game and let you unwittingly deliver you to me.""

I froze, struggling to wrap my head around it.

""No wonder you weren't surprised to see me.""

""You were no different,"" he said with a smirk. ""I know who I will be marrying. So do you. It lines up perfectly, doesn't it?""

We changed a smile, sharing a tacit acknowledgment of everything.

When Harrison reached the Pickwick's villa, the front gate was teeming with people, including the Ridgeways.

The Ridgeways didn't object to the marriage swap.

Although Ryland was currently more popular, Harrison and he were still brothers. 

For them, their goal was to forge an alliance with the Pickwicks, so it didn't matter which son their daughter was betrothed to.

Caleb Pickwick couldn't stop praising, ""Anna is truly fortunate to be marrying you!

""You're so young and successful. Anna could not have hoped for a better match! We fully support this marriage!""

Harrison forced a smile. He had no desire to indulge them.

Seeing Harrison distracted, Anabella wanted to speak, but Hector cut her off. ""Our first choice for marriage had been Judy. But since the deed is done, we won't fuss over it. Let it be a lesson for Harrison's waywardness and keep your daughter away from us for now.""

Anabella sprang to her feet. ""What?""

Before she could defend herself, Caleb thundered, ""The adults are speaking! Don't interrupt!""

He turned to Hector with an obsequious smile. ""Sir Pickwick, forgive my daughter! We have no objections. The Pickwick family is distinguished, and a wife like Ms. Hansen befits Harrison perfectly.""

But Anabella didn't agree to it. She elbowed Harrison, hoping he could stick up for her.

As she moved, the ruby ring on her wrist slipped into view, and Hector happened to see it.

His face instantly darkened. He smacked the coffee table and fumed, ""Some, take that ring off Ms. Ridgeway's finger.""

Biting her lips, Anabella nudged Harrison again. ""Harry, you promised that this ring...""

""Take it off, Anna."" Harrison shut his eyes wearily. ""I'll buy you a better one.""

Before Anabella could react, the bodyguards stepped up, deftly removed the ring, polished it, and placed it in Hector's hand.

After the Ridgeways left, the scandal became the talk of the town.

At the charity dinner, we naturally became the center of attention.

Harrison looked at me openly, and I averted my gaze.

By accident, a waiter spilled wine on my dress. As I went to the lounge to tidy up, Harrison trailed after me.

He blocked my path and presented a diamond bracelet.

""Judy...""

I cut him short. ""Do you think I need this now?""

His face turned pale as he stubbornly held his hand out.

""Judy, I'm sorry for what I did to you, but you can't be with Ryland! He's unworthy of you!

""Come with me. Give me a chance to make it up to you. Please?""

With that, he leaned in to put the bracelet around my wrist.

But I thrust my hand away. The bracelet fell onto the marble floor, shattering into pieces as it had at the club that day.

He froze to the spot, tears welling up in his eyes.

I smiled faintly.

""This bracelet looks better on Anabella.""

Harrison knew exactly what I meant. His face went even paler, etched with pure shame.

He was about to speak when a shrill argument broke out nearby.

Martha Vyner, the Vyner Group heiress who'd always been hung up on Ryland, had cornered Anabella on the patio with Elsie and a couple of her lackeys.

""If you hadn't butted in, I'd at least have had a chance! Now that Ms. Hansen is married to Ryland, what am I supposed to do?""

Martha tried to shove Anabella, but Anabella smacked her hand away.

""I'm Mrs. Pickwick now! Go ahead and lay a finger on me! I dare you!""

""Bitch! Aren't you scared I'll spill all your dirty secrets to Mr. Pickwick?""

""Ryland and I are rock solid. Nothing you say could come between us!"" Anabella shot back.

As soon as Anabella finished speaking, Elsie lunged forward and slapped her hard across the face!

Harrison instinctively moved to intervene, but Elsie's roar stopped him cold. ""We all saw you fake that fall at the jewelry store to frame Ms. Hansen that day!

""Lately, Mr. Pickwick's been sending lavish gifts to Ryland's villa just to win Ms. Hansen's forgiveness. Even when she throws it out, he keeps coming back! You think he'll still want you once he finds out the truth?"" 

That sent Anabella over the edge. ""So what?"" she shrieked. ""I got him to stay once. I can do it again!""

""You have no shame! First, you stole my fiancé because you thought his family connections were better than yours! The second his family got investigated, you cut ties with him right away. You almost drove him to kill himself over you!

""A while back, you didn't think the professor's son your family picked for you had a promising future, so you faked drowning to latch onto Mr. Pickwick. You ruined his relationship with Ms. Hansen for good! This is all on you! I'm gonna make sure Mr. Pickwick finds out today!""

Elsie turned to leave after that, but Anabella pounced and grabbed her by the hair!

""Bitch! I fought for what's mine. Who do you think you are to ruin me?""

She went crazy, hitting and scratching Elsie like a maniac. Martha and the others tried to pull her off, only to get scratched and bloodied themselves.

At that moment, Anabella didn't look even a little bit as delicate as she usually did.

""Anabella, are you out of your mind? You dared to hit me?""

""So what? Harry's got my back!""

With that, she kicked Elsie, who was now on the ground, and then threw herself into the nearby ornamental pond, screaming for help.

Harrison and I watched every single second of this.

I let out a scoff and turned to leave, but a heavy thud came from behind me.

Harrison had dropped to his knees right in front of me.

""Judy..."" His voice trembled. ""So, that's the truth... I've been blind this whole time.""

I turned and looked down at him, a sneer tugging at my lips. ""It's too late for apologies, Mr. Pickwick. Take care.""

Back in the hall, I ran into Ryland, who'd been looking for me.

I filled him in on what just happened, and as I spoke, security brought up Martha, Elsie, and Anabella.

Some had scratched-up faces, and others had messy hair.

Anabella got the worst of it. She was carried up on a stretcher, soaking wet and unconscious from swallowing so much water.

That night, the Pickwick family was thrown into utter chaos.

After they got back, Anabella was put under house arrest.

When she woke up, she had no clue what was going on and threw a fit demanding to see Harrison, only to be hit with proof that she was the one who started the rumors about the wedding swap. 

Harrison slammed the divorce papers in front of her right then and there, and Anabella passed out from anger.

She was sent back to the Ridgeway family before long and ended up in Elsie's hands.

Word got around that her dad married her off to an old, rich guy with weird kinks.

Ryland had just finished telling me all this when the butler came to announce, ""Mr. Pickwick is here. He's heading to the Middle East to handle the family business and wanted to say goodbye.""

""No need for that,"" I smiled faintly. ""Tell him he can come to the party after September.""

The butler froze for a second, then laughed and left.

Ryland was confused. ""After September? Is that your birthday?""

I just smiled without answering and got up to leave.

Suddenly, it clicked. His eyes lit up instantly! Ryland laughed heartily, caught up to me in a few strides, and scooped me up into his arms, his entire being radiating unrestrained joy.

The end.

I’ve been browsing some communities recently, and I’m looking to connect with someone who’s interested in video editing — you don’t have to be a pro.
Even if you’re just passionate about it, starting out, or know the basics, that’s totally fine. I just need some advice.

I don’t want to explain the details publicly, but if you’re in Whitefield, I’d be happy to meet in person — coffee on me — and get your guidance.

And yeah… my English isn’t the best, so I used ChatGPT to help me write this 😅

1paky2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_moxymoxysam/comments/1paky2w/my_neighbor_fantasy/,My Neighbor Fantasy,"It was a crisp, frosty Saturday morning. After working all week I was glad to have the entire Saturday free, but being single and having not much of a social life for a 25 year old woman, it also felt a bit boring and lonely. So I decided to go on a little walk around my apartment complex.

I stepped out of my door, past the Christmas lights hung around my door, the Mickey and Minnie Mouse figurines, the Lilo and stitch Christmas sign, and some other decorations that showed my love for the holiday and my apparent singleness. Wearing an old pink t shirt, black loose fitting sweatpants and vans with no socks, my short blond hair up in a loose ponytail, and no bra to conceal my poky nipples, I felt ratty and ugly. But a walk is a walk.

Moments later I was in the cool air, enjoying myself and my thoughts. I spent about 10 minutes walking until I returned to my building. I turned the corner to my unit when I saw someone across the hall. “Oh hi! You must be my new neighbor…” I choked, my voice lost in my throat. I recognized you.

All the things I’d done for you, the things you taught me about myself, the best sex of my life and the deepest darkest kinks, it all came flooding back when I saw you. “Hi” I whispered, barely audible. 

You stood smiling, towering over me, fit and muscular, black muscles shining through your white shirt, your BBC straining against your jeans even now. You and I had dated in college, well not so much dated as fucked. You never found me pretty or interesting enough to date me, but you, and sometimes your friends, would use me for days on end, nothing was unavailable, I was yours.

Now I stood smiling shyly at you. “I can’t believe you’re my new neighbor…do you want to, i don’t know, come in for coffee?” I motioned into my apartment. Moments later we were inside, garland and stray Christmas decorations filled the space. I put a coffee pot on and turned to see you smiling deviously at me.

I didn’t say a word, in an instant, your hands were on me, roughly taking my clothes off. I was naked, maroon panties at my ankles, your hand on my neck. My back was to my kitchen sink. I heard you take off your belt and shortly it was around my neck, choking me, making me gasp, and then moan. My panties came off my ankles as my feet left the ground, only for you to pick them up, lift my hands up, and expertly tie my wrists to the handles of the two cupboards above the sink, leaving me displayed naked in my kitchen. The coffee percolated next to me, sounding like a small cafe as I caught my breath while you admired my small body, my small slightly sagging boobs, my small but fit butt and legs. 

“Sami, Sami, Sami, no wonder you’re single, look at you, a Disney adult, Christmas all over, this ain’t what real men want. Real men want this” he smiled as he groped my ass and kissed me. It was heaven.

“Now…let’s make you look proper” he said as he grabbed a sharpie and right above my smooth shaved pussy he bent down and wrote, “BBC Slave, please help beautify me”

Pulling out his phone, me bound helplessly in my own apartment, he said, “the boys will love to see this…smile” I obeyed. “Oh and want to know who told me about your place, otherwise I never would have found you…it was your sweet mama”

They'll say things like ""look at this cathedral. We have a historic library. We're near the beautiful city center. There's a Gregg's. Look at the beautiful overlook we have of this wooded area"" 

One video said ""it's home to the most posh Gregg's in England.""

Is there anything you’d consider crucial to bring? 

I have a lot on my wish list below, but much of it will be driving and doing pullouts for photos, since my joints won’t handle much more than an easy 2-3 miles hike max on a good day. I would love suggestions, recommendations, and opinions from those in the know, to make this an amazing trip!

I ate some of the soup. It was very salty, so I didn’t finish it. 

The main course was served.  It was extremely salty. Almost unbelievably salty - like someone had poured an entire salt shaker into it. I ate only a few bites and set it aside. 

The server came back after about 20-25 minutes and asked how everything was. I said, I’m afraid it’s too salty for me, so I’ll just have my bill please. 

She responded by telling me I should have said something. I thought that was an odd thing to say as I had not seen her since the main course was served - which was understandable as the diner was very busy. I don’t know when she thought I should have told her. Maybe I was supposed to go find her? 

She also told me the food was extra salty because it’s homemade / made from scratch. Which I thought was an odd thing to say as made from scratch means the salt content is controlled by the cook. 

I didn’t argue with her at all, I just said it’s all fine, no problem. 

She went to get the bill and when she returned she told me she had taken the main course off my bill and charged me for just the soup and coffee. I thanked her. I left her a cash tip that was approximately 21% of the (soup and coffee only) bill. 

My friend tells me I was wrong and should have tipped the server based on what the bill amount would have been if the server hadn’t removed the main course from the bill. She said the server voluntarily adjusting the bill should have been rewarded with a larger tip. I thought tipping 21% was reasonable. Am I wrong? Thank you. ",29,1764516157.0,amiwrong,42,0.86,False

All of them, including the male adult, blast their phones nonstop downstairs i mean full on scrolling videos on facebook or tiktok, or just loud youtube videos. Imagine 4 or 5 simultaneously blaring loud devices but different sounds..in an open concept downstairs, so basically 1 big room, theres a partial partition with another living room but its still open.Then theres me, who gets overstimulated to the point i want to cry and scream and lock myself away but I cant because im a mom so i dont hang out in my bedroom upstairs. If i go to sit out on the patio, kids follow. The adults cant watch tv, cant hear it 🤷‍♀️ the children have completely taken over. When the child on the weekends visits theyre not allowed upstairs due to previous horrendous behavior, so i somewhat understand on the weekends its going to be a little more overstimulating having the additional blaring device but I feel like its rude, lack of manners and definitely lack of consideration to play a device loudly in a common area not even once thinking about the other people (me). For instance, last night i put on a Christmas movie for me to watch in the living room, and not only did I have to keep telling my twins to turn their phones down, but my partners son also was blasting his phone and my partner doesnt even register it whatsoever. He tunes his surroundings out and he doesnt even see a problem.  Even if he does tell them to turn it down its only to ""not piss me off"" instead of teaching them its very inconsiderate. So, i started crying and gave up and went upstairs.If i was the only adult Id make it a rule that they need to go to the 2nd living room thats attached, or use headphones, or at the very least turn it down to where other people (me) can at least drink coffee in the morning in my own house without being completely crushed by the blaring sounds, or maybe watch a movie, or whatever maybe Id like to do. I could not imagine being in a room with other people, even in my own house i pay for, and just loudly watching videos on my phone. Its cringey how inconsiderate it is. I dont do it. I guess my question in all of this is, am i wrong? My partner says im the problem and the kids are being kids and I am trying to take away their childhood. He says this in front of them so I am made to be the household villan. So, im always beating myself up and suffering in my own house because there is zero adult space, zero adult time, nowhere not overstimulating, not even after bedtime because 2 of the kids always end up in our room. Im going insane. I am unable to tune out my surroundings, im very sensory sensitive and i am pretty understanding but i dont think anyone in this house considers anybody but themselves. I dont ask for any kind of treatment that I dont also give out myself. None of these kids are toddlers anymore. Everyone should learn common courtesy. Right??

Sometimes I make a traditional pot of coffee for my parents so a separate grinder could be nice so we can start using fresh coffee.

I've used the Express and found it great. I could easily pull a shot from one machine, and it always tasted amazing. Not sure about the grinder/fine tuning process with beans as it was not my machine so that part was taken care of for me. It made tasty coffee and that's all I care about. Not really interested in nerding out on espresso. The only con is the size. She is huge!! 

The bambino is much smaller which is good. I don't have much space. It heats up quick. Does it brew as well as the express? I'd have to buy the separate grinder but everyone seems to love the one I picked. Arguably this is just as easy as the express, right? Grind, prep, brew.

I have GAD, first started in 2020 when I had a panic attack driving and I found little relief since. I still am not able to drive on the highway for the fear of panicking. 
I did Genomind testing to determine the best anxiety medication since I react very strongly to any type of medication – buspar came out as a better match then most traditional drugs.
I am on week four, I still have incredible dizziness and blurred vision, especially up to an hour after taking it. I also have symptoms of shallow breathing or feeling like I can’t get a deep breath, slight slurred speech, and muscle tension. These symptoms are once in a while, and don’t last forever, but they still concern me.  I’m just starting to notice that my morning coffee is exasperating these symptoms so I will try not to take them together moving forward. 
Buspar has helped with my anxiety, it keeps panic just under the surface – which is an improvement to having full-blown panic attacks. But I still feel the panic lingering in my body. Not sure if that makes sense. So I don’t want to stop taking it because it’s the only thing that has remotely given me relief. 

My question is are these side effects common still at four weeks? Has anyone found relief sticking with this drug longer through this time. And have side effects eased up?

I am on 2.5 mg two times per day.

1pakn7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/WoadStressManagement/comments/1pakn7q/call_centre_stress_management/,Call Centre Stress Management,"**Call Centre Stress Management** – The hum of headsets, the constant ping of notifications, the pressure to meet KPIs—working in a call centre is notoriously demanding and requires specific Stress Management techniques. Agent burnout and stress are significant challenges, leading to high turnover and decreased performance. But the conversation is shifting from simply acknowledging the problem to implementing powerful, modern solutions

This isn’t just about beanbags and free coffee; it’s about building genuine emotional resilience. Let’s explore the trending stress management techniques that are revolutionizing call centre environments and empowering agents to thrive.



# 5 Call Centre Stress Management Techniques

**1. Mindfulness and Micro-Meditations**

Forget the idea of meditating for an hour. The latest trend is micro-meditations: 60-90 second breathing exercises agents can use between calls. This practice is a powerful tool for emotional regulation, allowing agents to reset, release the tension from a difficult interaction, and approach the next call with a fresh, calm mindset. Encouraging a quick “mindful moment” to focus on breath can drastically reduce anxiety and prevent overwhelm.



**2. Gamification for Good**

Gamification is moving beyond just sales leaderboards. Forward-thinking centres are using it to promote wellness and stress management.

Make it fun! – Think about challenges that reward positive behaviours;





* points for taking scheduled breaks,
* badges for utilizing breathing exercise apps,
* team-based goals for positive customer feedback.





This transforms wellbeing from a mandate into an engaging, positive competition that boosts morale and reduces stress.



**3. Leveraging AI-Powered Tools**

Artificial Intelligence is now a key ally in stress management. AI-powered sentiment analysis can monitor call tone in real-time, flagging signs of rising customer (and agent) frustration. This allows for proactive intervention, like a supervisor offering support. Furthermore, AI-driven coaching platforms can analyze calls to provide personalized feedback on pace, tone, and language, reducing the anxiety of performance reviews and giving agents clear, actionable ways to improve.



**4. Creating a Culture of Psychological Safety**

A major source of stress is the fear of making a mistake. The trending solution is building psychological safety—an environment where agents feel safe speaking up, asking for help, and even being vulnerable about their stress levels without fear of reprisal. This is fostered through supportive leadership, open communication channels, and viewing difficult calls as learning opportunities rather than pure failures.



**5. Ergonomic and Environmental Optimization**

Stress isn’t only mental; it’s physical. Investing in ergonomic assessments for chairs, desks, and headsets reduces physical strain, which is a huge contributor to overall fatigue. Additionally, creating designated quiet zones or breakout areas where agents can truly disconnect during their breaks is essential for mental recovery away from the noise of the floor. These ergonomic assessments are crucial for Call Centre Stress Management



# Building a Resilient Workforce

Call Centre Stress Management is no longer a perk—it’s a critical component of a successful operation. By integrating these trending techniques, from high-tech AI tools to simple cultural shifts, contact centres can foster a healthier, happier, and more productive workforce.



# The result?





* Reduced attrition,
* Improved customer satisfaction,
* Agents who feel supported, valued, and equipped to handle the daily challenges of the job.





Investing in agent well-being isn’t just the right thing to do; it’s the smartest business decision you can make.



# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) - Call Centre Stress Management

**Q1: What is a quick stress-relief technique an agent can use at their desk?**

A1: The 4-7-8 breathing technique is highly effective. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, and exhale slowly for 8 seconds. This triggers the body’s relaxation response and can be done discreetly between calls.



**Q2: How can call centre leadership help reduce team stress?**

A2: Leaders can promote stress management by encouraging regular breaks, recognizing effort (not just results), fostering a supportive team environment, and providing access to mental health resources or Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs).



**Q3: Are there specific technologies that help with agent wellbeing?**

A3: Yes. Technologies like AI sentiment analysis tools, gamified wellness platforms, and performance management software that offers constructive, data-driven feedback are all designed to reduce agent anxiety and improve the overall work experience.

1pakmk2,https://i.redd.it/wk5t1wckue4g1.jpeg,Sudden Impact (1983),"A rare movie where the villain is a woman—and a serial killer at that. Making Harry's mirror image female, driven by revenge for her sister's abuse, creates far more troubling and complex material than simply pitting him against a death squad like in Magnum Force. Beyond hunting the serial killer, Harry stays busy: dodging cartels, crooks, and more crooks. He can't even grab coffee or drive without stumbling into trouble.



Sondra Locke delivers a terrific performance, and the film's dual nature gives Clint Eastwood plenty of room to work. The dog might just be the best supporting actor in the series.



Eastwood's direction is solid, featuring moody lighting and striking shots. In that regard, it's second only to the original Dirty Harry. I'll go further: this is the second-best Dirty Harry movie overall. It unexpectedly made my day.



Now I'm off for a hot dog—with mustard, not ketchup, of course.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Iowa State Cyclones vs. Indiana Hoosiers: A Clash of Unbeaten Titans**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a showdown between two undefeated behemoths: the **Iowa State Cyclones** (8-0) and the **Indiana Hoosiers** (7-0). This isn’t just a game—it’s a battle of wills, rebounding prowess, and whether Tucker DeVries can keep his dad’s job as head coach by not chucking 3s into the stands. Let’s break it down with the precision of a stat geek and the wit of a late-night host who’s had one too many coffee infusions.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The numbers don’t lie (well, they might if they’re in a casino, but let’s assume they’re sober here). Iowa State is a **-7.5-point favorite** on the spread, with decimal odds of **1.31** (implied probability: **76.3%**). Indiana, meanwhile, sits at **+3.6** (implied probability: **27.8%**). The total is set at **139.5 points**, with even money on over/under.

Translation? Bookmakers think this will be a low-scoring, defensive slugfest. But let’s not take their word for it—after all, they’re the same people who once gave “Bigfoot wins chess match” +500 odds.

---

### Team News: Injuries, Strengths, and Shoelaces

**Iowa State**: The Cyclones are a rebounding **vacuum cleaner**. Their 44-26 edge over Marquette? That’s like a toddler hoarding all the candy at a Halloween party. Jada Williams (15 points, 11 rebounds) and Arianna Jackson (9 rebounds) are the team’s gravitational anchors, while Addy Brown and Audi Crooks split scoring duties like a well-balanced buffet. But beware: Crooks fouled out in 22 minutes, which is less playing time than a TikTok dance trend.

1paklus,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1paklus/list_of_dramafree_superchargers_for_nontesla/,List of drama-free superchargers for non-Tesla vehicles in the United States,"""What is a drama-free supercharger?"" A Tesla supercharger that:

* Allows at least some non-Tesla vehicles to charge (with a NACS adapter, or with Magic Dock).
* Has a long cord (a V4 supercharger).

This means everyone should be able to charge their vehicle without taking up multiple spots. In other words, you should not expect more drama than you would find at Electrify America.

NOT ALL HAVE MAGIC DOCK. Always pack your NACS adapter, or check the Tesla app, which will tell you if an adapter is required. These are all V4 superchargers, so most will have Magic Dock and allow all CCS vehicles, but unfortunately not all. It's best to verify this info in the Tesla app, which you must have to charge anyway.

This information comes entirely from [supercharge.info](http://supercharge.info), an enthusiast-run, completely independent site that keeps track of every supercharger. Very cool site. Many thanks to them. If you see inaccuracies, I suggest making an account there and submitting updates (politely). It would be nice if they flagged Magic Dock versus non-... but, they are busy volunteers.

Currently there are 572 drama-free superchargers in the United States.

1pakluh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pakluh/fomotidine_pinky_finger_twitching/,Fomotidine & Pinky finger twitching,"39 Female. ENT put me on 20 mg 2x a day Fomotidine. I’m on close to 4 weeks of taking it. I’ve cut out caffeine (coffee was my main source of caffeine), due to the severe reflux and my doc advised additional dietary removals along with the using prescribed Fomotidine. 

My sore throat pain is starting to get better, and my throat feels less sore, but if I eat triggering foods, the soreness amps up again. I have a follow up by the end of this week. 

 I noticed maybe a week ago my left pinky finger twitches when I’m falling asleep. Is this a side effect of either the Fomotidine or my caffeine removal? 

How long before my throat fully clears up? Any foods I should ADD to my diet to manage Fomotidine symptoms and also create better gut microbiome to improve the reflux?

My sister knew someone with H Pylori and thinks since my throat isn’t 100% better, I should get tested for that. Thoughts?",1,1764515569.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Towering stacks of those indestructible, quad-ruled, double-spiral tanks: coffee rings, bent wires, pages torn out in fury, ink smudged from shaky hands. They’re my trademark, the only notebook I’ve ever used for every single thing in my life. And when I flip through them now, 10 years later, it still knocks the wind out of me.

Year 1 entry: “Day 4. Hands shaking so bad the letters look drunk. Can’t imagine ever laughing again.”

Six months later, same Ampad: “Laughed until I cried at dinner tonight. Forgot this feeling even existed.”

Year 3: “Turned down a drink at a wedding and didn’t even flinch. Who the hell is this guy?”

Year 7: “Coached a guy through his first 30 days today. Told him it gets better. Meant every word.”

Whenever the momentum dips or the “I’ve arrived, I can coast” voice shows up, I pull one of those beat-up double-spirals off the shelf and get hit with undeniable proof in my own handwriting: **You’ve already done the impossible. Keep going.**

Journaling isn’t just dumping the day. It’s building your personal hall-of-fame, exhibit by exhibit, in ink that doesn’t lie. Nothing reignites the drive like cold, hard evidence of how far you’ve already come. So yeah, I’ll keep preaching double-spiral Ampads and daily writing until they bury me with one. Because nothing fuels tomorrow like proof of yesterday.

Who else has cracked open an old notebook and got that “holy hell, look at this” moment?

1pakkjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/WoadStressManagement/comments/1pakkjn/top_strategies_to_reduce_allostatic_load/,Top Strategies to Reduce Allostatic Load,"Discover how to manage your body's stress response and enhance your overall health with proven strategies to reduce allostatic load.

# Allostatic load - Stress reduction

Allostatic load refers to the wear and tear on the body caused by chronic stress. It is the cumulative effect of the body’s physiological response to repeated or chronic stressors. By understanding the basics of it you can gain insights into how it affects your overall health and well-being.

One important aspect of allostatic load is the body’s stress response system, which involves the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones help the body respond to stress in the short term, but when stress becomes chronic, they can have negative effects on various systems in the body.

In order to effectively manage this, it is crucial to recognize the signs and symptoms of chronic stress. These may include fatigue, sleep disturbances, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and changes in appetite or weight. By identifying these symptoms, you can take proactive steps to improve your overall health.



# Lifestyle Adjustments for Stress Reduction

Making lifestyle adjustments is an essential strategy for reducing allostatic load and managing stress. By incorporating healthy habits into your daily routine. you can help regulate your body’s stress response and promote overall well-being.

One effective lifestyle adjustment is prioritizing self-care activities. This may include engaging in hobbies or activities that bring you joy and relaxation, practicing mindfulness or meditation, getting enough sleep, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

Another important aspect of lifestyle adjustments is adopting stress management techniques. These may include deep breathing exercises, regular physical activity, and seeking social support from friends, family, or support groups.

Additionally, it is crucial to assess and address any sources of chronic stress in your life. This may involve setting boundaries, delegating tasks, or seeking professional help when needed. By making these lifestyle adjustments, you can significantly reduce allostatic load and improve your overall well-being.



# The Role of Diet and Nutrition in Managing Allostatic Load

Diet and nutrition play a crucial role in managing allostatic load and promoting overall health. By fueling your body with nutritious foods, you can support your body’s stress response system and reduce the negative effects of chronic stress.

One important aspect of diet and nutrition is consuming a balanced and wholesome diet. This includes incorporating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats into your meals. These nutrient-dense foods provide essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support your body’s resilience to stress.



# Diet and Stress Reduction

Another important consideration is to avoid or limit the intake of foods that can contribute to increased stress and inflammation. These may include processed foods, sugary snacks, caffeine, and alcohol. By reducing the consumption of these items, you can help regulate your body’s stress response.

In addition to a healthy diet, staying hydrated is crucial for managing allostatic load. Drinking an adequate amount of water throughout the day helps support proper bodily functions and can help reduce the negative effects of chronic stress.

Reduce, as much as possible the consumption of prepared soft drinks, sodas, flavoured water and energy drinks. One or two cups of tea or coffee without sugar is acceptable and in some cases even beneficial, just be aware that caffeine can increase your stress response.

Overall, adopting a wholesome and balanced diet, while avoiding foods that contribute to stress, can significantly reduce allostatic load and improve your overall well-being.



# Physical Activity as a Tool for Alleviating Stress

Engaging in regular physical activity is an effective tool for alleviating stress and reducing allostatic load. Exercise has been shown to have numerous benefits for both physical and mental health, making it an essential strategy in maintaining a balanced lifestyle.

When you engage in physical activity, your body releases endorphins, which are natural mood-boosting chemicals. These endorphins help reduce stress, improve mood, and promote a sense of well-being. Regular exercise also helps regulate the body’s stress response system, making it more resilient to chronic stressors.

There are various forms of physical activity that you can incorporate into your routine. This may include aerobic exercises such as walking, jogging, or swimming, as well as strength training exercises. Find activities that you enjoy and make them a regular part of your schedule to effectively alleviate stress.

It is important to note that physical activity should be tailored to your individual needs and abilities. Consult with a healthcare professional before starting a new exercise routine, especially if you have any underlying health conditions.

By incorporating regular physical activity into your lifestyle, you can effectively alleviate stress, reduce allostatic load, and improve your overall well-being.



# Mindfulness and Mental Health Practices to Lower Allostatic Load

Practising mindfulness and mental health techniques can be powerful tools in lowering allostatic load and improving overall well-being. These practices help cultivate a sense of calm, reduce stress, and enhance resilience to chronic stressors.

One effective practice is mindfulness meditation. This involves focusing your attention on the present moment, without judgment. By practising mindfulness meditation regularly, you can train your mind to become more aware of your thoughts and emotions, and develop a greater sense of clarity and calm.



# mindfulness stress management

Other mental health practices that can help lower allostatic load include journaling, engaging in creative activities, and seeking therapy or counselling. These practices provide an outlet for self-expression, promote emotional well-being, and help manage stress.

It is important to prioritize self-care and make time for these practices in your daily routine. Even a few minutes of mindfulness meditation or engaging in a creative activity can have significant benefits for reducing allostatic load and improving your overall mental health.



# Conclusion

In conclusion, incorporating mindfulness and mental health practices into your lifestyle can help lower allostatic load and promote overall well-being. By taking care of your mental health, you can better manage stress and enhance your body’s stress response system.

1pakh6y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pakh6y,"Sarta Coffe - Vila Madalena, SP","
Ontem tive uma das experiências mais especiais com café no Sarta, na Vila Madalena. Provei três cafés da La Cabra e cada um deles trouxe um universo diferente na xícara.

Comecei pelo Geisha lavado da Guatemala, do produtor Diego de la Cerda. Ele é um café de leilão do Cup of Excellence e já no aroma dá para sentir o quanto é complexo e elegante. Floral absurdo, delicado e cheio de camadas. Eles tinham o mesmo grão só que torrado pela April, o que achei interessante pra sacar perfis diferentes de torra.

Depois fui para dois colombianos:

O El Estoraque, do produtor Jeison Liban López, veio com caturra e castillo lavados, uma acidez vibrante e notas bem claras de manga e frutas vermelhas. 

O Potosí Washed trouxe frutas tropicais, doçura limpa e uma sensação muito equilibrada. Direto e elegante ao mesmo tempo. Tive a oportunidade de provar esse no Longão, mas a extração do Edu, no Sarta, deixou as frutas tropicais bem evidente. 

Para fechar, pedi o espresso Low Caff da Daterra, variedade Aramosa Laurina. Corpo leve, crema linda, fruta tropical e uma doçura muito natural. A uva ficou exalando na boca durante horas. Senti um pouco de adistringência no final, mas acho que foi por tempo de torra, pois tinha 7 dias. Cafés como estes são bem delicados e precisam de, no mínimo, uns 15 dias para abrir. 

Um detalhe que fez diferença: todas as extrações foram feitas com Lotus Water e filtros Sibarist, o que deu ainda mais clareza para cada perfil de sabor. Foi a primeira vez que provei cafés feitos com os filtros Sibarist e minerais da Lotus. Por conta disso, o preço de cada filtrado ficou entre 45-75 reais. 

Em relação à hospitalidade do Sarta, admiro mais ainda o trabalho deles. Os baristas transitam pelo espaço com bastante calma, atenção e batem um papo longo sobre café com o cliente. Vale a visita. ",6,1764515251.0,CafeEspecialBR,0,1.0,False

>*But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith will not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.*   
*— Luke 22:32* *^((BSB))*

It’s a great comfort to know that Jesus is watching over us and interceding for us. When His disciples were about to face a severe test, Jesus prayed especially for Peter, knowing that he was most in danger: “Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail.”

Christ’s concern for us becomes even more tender when He sees our weakness. The more difficult our struggles, the more earnestly He prays for us and the more powerfully He helps us.

It’s encouraging to remember that this story of Jesus interceding for Peter is a picture of what He is doing for all of us. From heaven, He watches over us, and when we are in danger, He lifts His hands in prayer for us before God.",2,1764515194.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False

These are some places I thought could be visited on day trip (excluding all theme parks as it won’t be feasible with 1 yr old). 

1. Mosque 
2. ⁠qasr al watan 
3. ⁠etihad towers or
3. Heritage village 
4. ⁠louvre stopover for photo stop 
5. ⁠Emirates palace pass by 
6. ⁠corniche pass by 

I looked up some packages available on get your guide and had couple of questions below. 

1. For mosque some were offering guided tour and some self walk. We are history person so I feel guided might be useful but then I feel that could also be one of diaper changing stops with baby. So thinking if we go with self guided would it still be good experience? 

2. Some packages offer either heritage village visit or etihad towers observation deck. Now I am already visiting burj khalifa and sky view observatory in Dubai. Is this experience at etihad towers still worth it or should I do heritage village? I am also visiting old Dubai for historic vibes so again that’s a thing. Also skeptical if heritage village will be stroller friendly or not. 

3. Emirates palace is just pass by , I know there is some coffee shops where you can sip and enjoy. Is that worth the thing that this makes you choose to go with private tour instead as none of getyourguide have stopover at this ? Private are more than double on get your guide. 

4. Can I visit all these places in day trip if I do private tour instead of shared one specially with baby and would that extra money be worth it? I don’t want to visit louvre from inside stopover is fine. 

5. Any companies I can reach out for private ? Get your guide was 160 cad per person so maybe 320 total and private was like 850 cad which is crazy insane to me. ",2,1764515046.0,dubai,0,1.0,False

It makes it really hard for actual women to connect. I just want normal female friends for coffee, walks, gym, hanging out. Nothing weird. But because of the constant male spam, genuine girls either don’t comment or stay silent because they don’t want unwanted attention.

I know women here can be more private and cautious online. But still, it shouldn’t be this difficult to find a simple circle of female friends in a big city.

It's been one year since we broke up. You recently reached out to check up on me after you learned about my injury. I left it for a couple days, in part because it threw me off guard, in part because I've been with someone else for almost 9 months, and wanted her perspective before I spoke to you. 

And it was fine, it was. But talking to you again just brought up all the shit that happened between us all over again. So I, like an idiot (because I always was when it came to you), reached out for a coffee and a talk. Apologies were made, great.

But I wish you hadn't reached out. I wish I hadn't reached out. I wish we would have just left it in silence.

Because I convinced myself I would be okay talking to you, again. But the reality is that everything still stings. Let me be clear - I do not want you back. I've been enjoying my life as it has gone forward.

But it will never change the fact that loving you *hurt* at every turn. And I know I don't need to explain why. You know.

The shittiest part, flower? It didn't stop every single thing I loved about you from surging back to the surface. It didn't stop that same shaky, nervous energy that I felt on our first date, every time you'd kiss me, or hold my hand or the back of my neck. It didn't stop that rush that came when you looked into my eyes and smiled at me.


It didn't stop me reaching out on the shittiest holiday of our previous relationship, to check on you, to make sure you had a good meal. It didn't stop me wanting to share that labor of love with you.

It didn't stop my heart clenching up in my chest, seeing you again, smelling you again. Having you so close, but never really having you. Because that's all it ever was. I was your escape, and nothing more. And when you decided that my problems were too much for you, you didn't even ask me about them. You shut me out completely for weeks, in favor of spending time with ""just a friend"".

That's what stung the most, to have you tell me that I need to open up, only to be shut down when I tried. To be made to feel like I didn't even exist, let alone matter. And then to be blamed for all of it - the broken trust, your reactions to my emotions as I tried desperately to explain why what you did hurt.

I'll always love you, I know that. The shape of it has changed, but it will always be a space for you.

But I wish you hadn't reached out. The silence was deafening, but at least I could still pretend that you didn't give a fuck about me - it was easier that way.

And I'll never tell you this in person, because you don't deserve my emotions. Because I'm fucking terrified that I will wreck everything good in my life, breaking down over the way you made me feel again. Because I know it would hurt you, too.

Hi, I’d really appreciate some advice about my situation. In short, my asexual boyfriend decided he wants to slowly explore his own sexuality, and we’re both trying to find ways to do that.

A bit of backstory — we met about a year and a half ago. Right at the beginning, he told me he’s asexual, he’s never had any sexual experience and didn’t plan to. On the other hand, he’s very into BDSM (just like me), and as a stone-top dominant he’s always been able to satisfy all my sexual and kinky needs. Sexual activities with toys or scenes where he touches my intimate areas don’t bother him — he even enjoys them, as long as he himself isn’t involved physically or using his intimate parts. Because of that, we’ve both been extremely happy in the relationship.

Recently something happened during our usual skin-on-skin cuddles (always non-sexual for us) — he got an erection and asked if I wanted to touch him there. I was shocked, but I did, and we had a few sexually intimate minutes until he became overstimulated and decided it was time for morning coffee (lol).

While we were drinking coffee, I brought up what happened because I wanted to know how he felt about it. He said it was surprisingly pleasant and stimulating, and he’d maybe like to slowly build some sexual intimacy from his side too — but really slowly.

My question is: do you have any ideas how to explore sexual intimacy from asexual side when you are non-sex repulsive asexual? (I don’t know how else to phrase it lol.) 

Of course we communicate about this and we’re trying to figure it out together, but we both are clueless and don't know even in which way to think. 😭",6,1764514869.0,asexuality,1,0.75,False
1pakalp,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1pakalp/im_finally_out_of_the_bux/,I'm finally out of the Bux!,"Good morning y’all! ☀️

It’s been a long time coming (and somehow only been a year 😂), but I’m FINALLY out.

Last year, I reapplied to the ’Bux remembering how much I loved working there back in 2014–2016, back when it was actually fun. I got denied by a bunch of stores, so when I finally got that call back, I was excited. I trained for two weeks, learned all the new drinks, new syrups, new foams, all the stuff we definitely didn’t have back when we were slinging morning buns and turkey stuffing paninis. It was a long time ago, y’all. 😂

But honestly? I regretted coming back pretty fast. And it wasn’t just the new CEO (though we’ll get to that circus in a minute).

I genuinely liked a lot of the people I worked with. They made the shifts bearable...you know, like when you walk into class and see your friends and go, “Okay… I can survive this today.”

But then there were the other partners, one in particular, who made my life hell from basically day one.

I was called names. I was insulted for how I dressed. My girlfriend was called “ugly and boring.” I got called a republican because of something I planned to cook for dinner 😂 like okay?? I was told I “didn’t look gay enough” and labeled an “old school lesbian,” which honestly… I’ll take it. I’ve got my priorities straight and that’s the straightest I’ll ever be. My sexuality isn’t my whole personality, and especially not something I showboat at work.

One day I was standing with Partner A (the terrible one) and Partner B, and B said while looking at me, “I don’t mean this in a weird way, but you have such a unique look, you could model for a video game.” I laughed because I just didn’t expect it. They both stared at me and asked why I was laughing. I said, “No, I promise, I’m flattered.”
Partner A then turns to me and goes, “Why would you think she was talking about you? With your millennial flare jeans and absolutely no style at all. She meant me.”

The secondhand embarrassment I got from that moment could’ve killed a Victorian child.

And it’s not like I ever did anything to her. She came for me guns blazing, every single day. Always loud about being a mental-health advocate while actively bullying me nonstop. My clothes, my girlfriend, my personality...everything was a target. All I wanted to do was clock in, work, and go home.

Now…the CEO. The company has gone to absolute shit. The hunger for money while paying us pennies to deal with chaos made my head spin like the exorcist.
The whole “write on every cup” thing was ridiculous, especially because we wrote MORE when it wasn’t required or tied to our jobs. Then they dropped drive-thru times to 60 seconds while expecting paragraph-long affirmations on cups? Make it make sense.

The “Back to Starbucks” campaign was laughable. I was there when Starbucks was a café. Now? It’s a jungle gym for adults and Gen Z to order $13 dessert drinks with 6,700 calories. We weren’t making coffee anymore, we were basically Dairy Queen in green aprons.

And the mandatory holiday hours? A joke. Asking if we want to sign up, only to turn around and say, “If you don’t, I’ll schedule you anyway.” So you’re telling me people cannot survive a single holiday without coffee? If some partners WANT to work, let them! Herd them into one or two stores and call it a day. Not everyone needs to be forced in. Holidays are for family, friends, or just quiet “me time” if you don’t celebrate.

The DMs were even worse. Never praise, never encouragement, just constant criticism and micromanaging. For everything. Literally everything. And don't be surprised if they have higher-ups sneak in on a holiday to make shit up about you because they had to wait at the register for more than 20 seconds. 

So yeah. I’m glad I’m out. It was a terrible experience, and the company can absolutely screw itself.

I found a better-paying job with actual growth, professionalism, and a boss who genuinely cares. It’s wild how rare that apparently is these days.
You know it's bad when you're forcing yourself in school and actively looking for jobs when you're on your breaks at work. 

This is my experience. If you want to work at place that makes coffee but not really, then Starbucks is for you. 

Starbucks might be everyone else’s cup of tea… but it’s not my steep. ☕️ ",7,1764514802.0,starbucks,1,0.89,False

I don't want to end up in a trashy relationship, just so I can say '' I have a bf! "" I'm the kind of hopeless romantic who wants to meet her partner by crashing into him and accidentally switching books. Yeah, I'm stupid and WAYYY to much into fictional stories, but it's still better than settling for the bare minimum. 

Again, not actively looking for someone, that's my problem, don't @ me on that. 

BUT DAMN MAN, I FELT LIKE CRAP TODAY. Me and my friends had planned an outing today, one of them is my colony best friend(I'll call her cbt), one's my school best friend (call her sbf), and 3rd was school bff's boyfriend (I was friends with him before they got in a relationship + I'm the one who set them up, so he and I aren't at odds, he's actually a really good friend of mine, and we almost always invite him out), now the only unsung variable was my colony bff's boyfriend, who came at the last moment. But I couldn't care less honestly, I had a feeling that'd happen, with the way her reactions had been 😭🙏

Although I was mentally prepared to be a fifth wheel, it still felt terrible. 
We went to DIY first, where ofc I'm the only one who bought anything for myself, sbf and cbf both got gifts lol. 

Then my sbf and her bf got in a fight. So when we went into the movies, it felt awkward, but I was sitting in the corner, so I really didn't care at some point. Cbf and her bf were enjoying the movie, but then she told me sbf was crying, and I was like THE HELL?? (they were both at fault for their fight btw) Then after intermission, o switched seats to sit in the middle, and calmed her down, then theive started again, and perhaps they worked it out and it was all good. But seeing both couples just sitting together, sharing talks and popcorn, holding hands, while I was just there with myself sitting in the middle, not feeling left out but just lonely enough, i felt so envious and happy for them, in a way I can't explain. 

Then we went to eat in McDonald's. Probably the only place where I didn't feel hella lonely. First me and my Cbf went to get the order. Her bf cam with us bcuz he felt awkward with with the other two (since they weren't related really, only connected through me lol) and the machine was glitching. I sent them off, and just stood there, i kinda expected them to come back ig, but oh well, I got the order, and just sad beside my cbf. It felt good though. I'm happy my friends are good enough to not make me feel lonely. We laughed and joked and everything. I was struggling to open a mustard packet when my friend saw me and suddenly said ""you should really get a bf"" and I was like ""really? I can do it myself smh"" and sbf's bf goes ""yeah next time, you should bring someone too"". It wasn't offensive or anything, but like it did kind of hit me, that I was basically fifth wheeling on a duble date. 
They were being all lovey dovey. Sbf and her bf sharing coffee, and cbf's bf helping her out when she spilled ketchup on herself. Kinda felt unreal just sitting there, just like that. 

Then we went to the game zone (yes we almost spent 6 hrs in the mall today) cbf's bf is hella competitive lol, and challenged me to game of air hockey, and a car racing game (beat him both times in air hockey, and 1 time in car racing lmao), it was really fun too, while we did this sbf and bf roam around, as they don't really like playing games (sbf is disabled, she doesn't have her right hand, so she prefers not playing games) again, my friends tried to ensure I didn't feel lonely, but it's something that's uncontrollable, like it or not, after being in a relationship for 6 months (which both of them were) it's inevitable that you'll want to spend more time with you partner than your friend. At some point I was just sitting there in a corner, while cbf and bf were playing games, while sbf and bf were checking out different things. Sbf saw me and we clicked pictures and everything, but like, all i felt was pity coming out of my best friends at these points. 

We went to zudio at last, where sbf and bf roamed around the shop. Cbf and bf were picking lip balms and everything (though this time she didn't let her bf pay, she ain't that kind of person) while I was just there, checking out stupid clothes and all. 

Many jokes about my shitty love life and ex (who is sbf's bf's best friend, and 3 of us are in the same school so 🙏) were made, I couldn't care less about the jokes, but what hurts more is being the only loney person among 5 people. 

This is honestly the 1st time I've fifth wheeled two couples, and 3rd time I've third wheeled. I'm so used to it atp, because my relationship only went on for a month, so I never got the chance to go on a REAL date. 

I'm not desperate enough to still get a bf outta nowhere, I still want a good partner. But considering my future of wanting to go abroad, I feel like that's only gonna happen after 4 years, when I do my masters. 

Idk how many of y'all relate to me 😭✌️I'm sure many of you are in healthy relationships, and I wish you all the best! But god I hate being single, I'm so tired of playing the cupid, the matchmaker, for once can't I be the match made? I really try to suppress these stupid feelings, knowing it's just some teenage phase, but I really just wanted to let it all out once. 

If there's anyone who feels the same, I hope y'all know, there are people like you. And if you look for love, you'll find it soon. You'll find it, I believe in you! But I feel it isn't meant for people like me, I just believe in traditional love, and sadly that's not how it works after you become and adult in this world, which'll soon be me. 

Maybe I'll become the sweet old lady with 12 cats, it's a sad future, but still better than settling for crap. Who knows what'll happen, but this day felt like a mirror, even if it wasn't meant to. 

Cheers to all, hope no one goes through this!

woke up, made coffee, shower, breakfast.  
normal morning nothing wrong, then i just sat down on the couch and had like nothing to do for the next hour. Just me and my phone

thats when it hit

that bored empty feeling and right behind it the urge. ""just check the odds real quick you dont have to bet just look whats on"" yeah we all know where that goes...

1+year clean and boredom is still my biggest trigger, not stress not bad days just having nothing to do. My brain doesnt know how to be still without wanting some kind of action

So instead of opening a betting app i opened this recovery tool ([tool](https://nogambling.app)) i use that has a journal. Back when i started going to GA meetings they always said write it down get it out of your head. I just started typing everything, how bored i was. How my brain was trying to trick me and how i knew one bet would turn into a full relapse by launch

Something about putting it on the screen made it feel smaller like this loud voice in my head but when i wrote it out it looked kinda pathetic honestly

20 min later i was at the gym and urge was gone  
Not saying this works every time but it worked today and today is all i got

If youre early in recovery watch out for boredom, its sneaky as hell doesnt feel dangerous but it is you should have something ready for when it shows up

whats your biggest trigger? and what do you do when boredom hits? It's kind a feel like nobody talks about this one enough...",3,1764514203.0,problemgambling,0,1.0,False

1pak1v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Appliances/comments/1pak1v8/most_people_just_fill_and_flick_the_switch_on/,"Most people just “fill and flick the switch” on their electric kettle – here’s the safer, better-tasting routine I ended up using","I only recently realised I’ve been using my electric kettle like a caveman with a light switch: fill it to some random level, slam the switch down, walk away. Then I’d wonder why my tea or coffee sometimes tasted weird or why the kettle looked tired after a year.

After reading a bit about safety and talking to some tea/coffee nerds, I changed a few small habits. Nothing fancy, but it genuinely improved both the taste and how “stable” the kettle feels.

First thing I fixed: I stopped filling it while it’s still on the base.  
Now I always lift it, take it to the sink, *then* fill. Super simple, but it means I’m not splashing water around the electrical connector, and I’m not tempted to flip it on while it’s basically empty.

While filling, I actually pay attention to the MIN/MAX lines now.  
Going under MIN can trip the dry-boil protection and cook the element for no reason; over MAX means once it boils, it can burp hot water out of the spout or lid.  
I also ditched my worst habit: re-boiling the same sad water that’s been sitting there for hours. Fresh cold water really does make tea and coffee taste cleaner.

The lid was another “oh, right” moment.  
Auto shut-off usually relies on steam hitting a thermostat. If the lid is half open, the steam just escapes into the kitchen, and the kettle can boil longer than needed or act a bit strange. Now I just make sure the lid properly clicks shut before I start it.

I also got into the habit of glancing at the base.  
If the kettle isn’t sitting flat and centred on the 360° base, some kettles won’t start at all, others cut out mid-boil. Two-second check, saves a lot of “why did this turn itself off again?” irritation.

The biggest game-changer for taste was actually using the temperature presets instead of boiling everything to death.  
With my old on/off kettle I boiled *everything*. With the temp-control one, I roughly do:

* Green tea: \~70–80°C (158–176°F)
* Oolong / lighter black teas: \~85–95°C (185–203°F)
* Pour-over coffee: \~93–96°C (200–205°F)
* Black tea / Turkish tea water: full boil, then a short rest

On my Saki temp-control kettle, the 80°C preset basically became the “green tea button”, and the difference in bitterness was huge once I stopped nuking it at a raging boil.

I also stopped playing “human thermostat” and turning it off early.  
I let it reach the target temperature or full boil and shut itself off. That seems kinder to the safety system and means I’m not constantly guessing if the water is “hot enough”.

Last thing: I don’t store water in the kettle anymore.  
I used to leave half a kettle “for later”, which just builds scale and gives that flat, slightly stale taste. Now I empty what’s left, pop the lid open for a bit so it can dry, and every so often I run a quick descale (bit of vinegar + water, then a couple of plain boils to rinse).

For those of you who install or repair kettles/small appliances:

As an homage to her, and to my wife (who is Canadian) I want to make a recipe that is ours.

I started this thanksgiving, I found a recipe for maple pecan pie, I threw in a splash of bourbon and topped it with crunchy sea salt and was left with a good, if a little sweet, result.

The key component is the custard, which (in my opinion) should have a bit of a luster to it and not be too sweet. The custard of this pie was a bit cloudy and quite sweet.

Questions for the pros here: what are the rules for the custard? What general guidelines are there to make the custard...custard? I'd like to experiment with bourbon, coffee, liquid smoke, etc. to flavor the custard, I want a silky result that isn't too sweet, and has complexity driven by flavors that pair nicely with the burnt sugar/molasses/maple sweetness and are representative of both of us. Any recommendations for flavors that pair nicely with pecans are also appreciated, bonus points for unexpected or strange pairings (I found black pepper in a pumpkin pie is 👌).

I have a crap ton of studying to do for uni so this is the worst time to be experiencing such side effects, but I'm determined to tough it out if there's a chance it goes away.

Did any of you experience this side effect when starting? If so, did it get better?

Yung eksena sa branch na ito parang peak food court eksena na nakatayo sa tabi ng table pag may patapos na kumain vibes.

Nasecure nila yung table - coffee table to yung may 4x na one seater chair, 2x na coffee table. But since madami yung previous na gumamit naglagay sila ng additional 2x na chairs na ginagamit dun sa round table, and 2x na small stools. So total of 8 chairs yung nandun sa area, pero ung 4 na additional nakaharang sa aisle.



Iniwan ni tita si pinsan, sumama sakin sa pila. Nagchchikahan kami, pag tingin naming kay pinsan may 2 na lalaki (mga early to mid 30s sila) na nakaupo dun sa 2 na chair na nakaharang aisle, pero part pa din nung area na nireserve namin. Nagkkwentuhan lang naman sila, magkaharap nakaupo, harmless ganon. So ok, sabi ko sige paalisin ko na lang pag uupo na tayo.



Naka order na ko, uupo na, nauna ako kay tita, nag excuse ako; nilapag ko ung bag ko and buzzer thing sa table. Kinausap ko si pinsan ng mahina, tinanong ko ""nagpaalam ba sayo tong mga to?"" Sabi nya hindi daw, bigla na lang daw umupo dun, tas tingin daw ng tingin sakanya as if nagbabalak na paalisin sya. So humarap ako dun sa kuya 1, wala si kuya 2 nag-CR yata, ""kuya, dito din po ba kayo? May ddating po kasi kaming kasama."" sabi nya ""ay inaantay ko lang kasamahan ko."" So ok sige hinayaan ko.

In my head I was like ""wtf?""



Nagbuzzer na ung kay tita - ready na order nya, nag excuse sya, nung bumalik sya di sya pinadaan ng kusa nung mga kuya, kasi nga nagddaldalan sila, so nag excuse sya in a sarcastic tone. Bumalik, at naupo ng nakamangot.



Me to K3: Kuya, dito din po kayo uupo? Nauna po kasi kami dto.

K3: Ay bakit for here ba kayo?

Me: Yes for here kami.



Si tita umeentry bumubulong ""bakit kasi kayo dito naka upo, wala naman kayo table dyan, nakaharang pa kayo sa daan, ang lapit lapit nyo pa samin!""

K3: Sige aalis kami pag dumating na yung drinks.

Me: Ok lang naman na inyo na yung upuan, pero move kayo onti kasi super lapit nyo samin.



As in halos shoulder to shoulder na si tita and si K3 sa super lapit.

Also, di rin naman nya alam na may nakupo dun kasi si K1 and K2 ang umupo ng walang paalam.



Dinedma nila ko. di na sila nag kkwentuhan, nakaupo na lang, mata mata na lang.

Nagbuzzer na yung thing for my order, tumayo ako and pinadaan nila ko.

Nung pabalik na ko, nakaharang si K2 and K3, nakatalikod si K2 sakin nakaharap sya kay K3. Di ako nagsasalita, hawak ko lang yung tray, tinapik ni K3 si K2, ""pre, dadaan.""



Pagka-upo ko sa seat ko

Me to K3: Kuya di naman namin pinapatayo, pero layo lang kayo konti kasi parang isang group lang tayo dito e.

Tita: Ang lapit lapit kasi ng upo nyo, wala naman kayo table dyan, bat ba kasi dyan kayo nakapwesto!

K3: Teka, aalis naman kami pero wag naman kayong ganya-

\*nag cut off na ko\*

Me: Tita tama na ako na lang.

Me: Kuya di naman namin kayo inaagawan ng upuan, pinapamove lang dun sa kabila kasi ang lapit nyo talaga, ang hirap mag kwentuhan kasi dikit na kayo samin o.

K3: Haharangan namin yun? 

Me: Eh nakaharang din naman kayo dito eh.

K3: Ah ok lang yun, ok lang kami dito.

Me: Ay hindi, sakin hindi ito ok, hindi ok na dyan kayo nakaupo.

K3: Antayin lang namin drinks namin.

Me: Fine. Bahala kayo.



Proceeds to sit there and look at each other. Di sila nag patinag, umupo talaga dun, yung hand-off area katapat lang namin, walang tao dun. Pwede naman sila maghintay dun para hndi awkward? But no, pinanindigan nilang maupo dun.



While kaming 3 walang nagsasalita, mga naka mangot lang.



Finally, nag buzz na ung thing nila, tumayo si K3 at K2 knuha yung drinks, yung tuod na si K1, naiwan nakaupo pa din dun. Pagkakuha ng drinks, si K2 umupo ulit, si K3 pabalik na nakatayo ppormang uupo ulit, tinignan ko na lang sya as if saying ""now what? dumating na drinks nyo, uupo ka pa?""



Niyaya nya na ung mga kasama nya at lumipat sila sa kabilang area ng store. 

Pagka-alis nila, tumayo ako at minove ko ung chairs sa area na tinuturo kong lipatan nila.



Minutes later, inayos ng staff yung chairs, binalik sa tables ung 2 na chair, and ung stools nilapit samin ulit.



The end.



Ang issue ko is, valid ba yung reaction? Or may less confrontational way ba to approach yung ganitong situation? Kasi I understand wala na talagang table, pero bakit kasi bigla na lang uupo ng walang paalam, tapos pag nag raise ng concern ung nauna sa table na uncomfortably close na sila samin, sila pa yung galit? Di ba dapat, ""ay sorry po sige alis na kami."" Mali ba ako?





TLDR: May biglang umupo na group of guys sa table namin ng walang paalam, tapos nagalit nung sinabihan kung pwedeng lumayo sila konti.

K3: Sige aalis kami pag dumating na yung drinks.

Me: Ok lang naman na inyo na yung upuan, pero move kayo onti kasi super lapit nyo samin.



As in halos shoulder to shoulder na si tita and si K3 sa super lapit.

Also, di rin naman nya alam na may nakupo dun kasi si K1 and K2 ang umupo ng walang paalam.



Dinedma nila ko. di na sila nag kkwentuhan, nakaupo na lang, mata mata na lang.

Nagbuzzer na yung thing for my order, tumayo ako and pinadaan nila ko.

Nung pabalik na ko, nakaharang si K2 and K3, nakatalikod si K2 sakin nakaharap sya kay K3. Di ako nagsasalita, hawak ko lang yung tray, tinapik ni K3 si K2, ""pre, dadaan.""



Pagka-upo ko sa seat ko

Me to K3: Kuya di naman namin pinapatayo, pero layo lang kayo konti kasi parang isang group lang tayo dito e.

Tita: Ang lapit lapit kasi ng upo nyo, wala naman kayo table dyan, bat ba kasi dyan kayo nakapwesto!

K3: Teka, aalis naman kami pero wag naman kayong ganya-

\*nag cut off na ko\*

Me: Tita tama na ako na lang.

Me: Kuya di naman namin kayo inaagawan ng upuan, pinapamove lang dun sa kabila kasi ang lapit nyo talaga, ang hirap mag kwentuhan kasi dikit na kayo samin o.

K3: Haharangan namin yun? 

Me: Eh nakaharang din naman kayo dito eh.

K3: Ah ok lang yun, ok lang kami dito.

Me: Ay hindi, sakin hindi ito ok, hindi ok na dyan kayo nakaupo.

K3: Antayin lang namin drinks namin.

Me: Fine. Bahala kayo.



Proceeds to sit there and look at each other. Di sila nag patinag, umupo talaga dun, yung hand-off area katapat lang namin, walang tao dun. Pwede naman sila maghintay dun para hndi awkward? But no, pinanindigan nilang maupo dun.



While kaming 3 walang nagsasalita, mga naka mangot lang.



Finally, nag buzz na ung thing nila, tumayo si K3 at K2 knuha yung drinks, yung tuod na si K1, naiwan nakaupo pa din dun. Pagkakuha ng drinks, si K2 umupo ulit, si K3 pabalik na nakatayo ppormang uupo ulit, tinignan ko na lang sya as if saying ""now what? dumating na drinks nyo, uupo ka pa?""



Niyaya nya na ung mga kasama nya at lumipat sila sa kabilang area ng store. 

Pagka-alis nila, tumayo ako at minove ko ung chairs sa area na tinuturo kong lipatan nila.



Minutes later, inayos ng staff yung chairs, binalik sa tables ung 2 na chair, and ung stools nilapit samin ulit.



The end.



Ang question is, OA ba yung reaction? Or may less confrontational way ba to approach yung ganitong situation? Kasi I understand wala na talagang table, pero bakit kasi bigla na lang uupo ng walang paalam, tapos pag nag raise ng concern ung nauna sa table na uncomfortably close na sila samin, sila pa yung galit? Di ba dapat, ""ay sorry po sige alis na kami."" Mali ba ako?



TLDR: May biglang umupo na group of guys sa table namin ng walang paalam, tapos nagalit nung sinabihan kung pwedeng lumayo sila konti.

1pajrfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Salinas/comments/1pajrfq/do_not_seek_after_ultimate_perfection_of_life/,"do not seek after ultimate perfection of life, because here that is","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1pajofs,https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficePolitics/comments/1pajofs/cringy_corporate_phrases_part_2/,Cringy Corporate Phrases - Part 2,"Last week I published a post covering some vomit inducing corporate phrases. I read your comments on the post and came up with part 2: phrases you hear in corporate when it wanrs to hurt you, but not take responsibility for it. 

Feel free to comment more phrases! 

-------------------------

1- “It’s a business decision. It’s not personal.”

Literal meaning: This choice is driven by business logic, and not petty emotions.


Real meaning: It IS personal; I don’t like you. But since I am too much of a coward to own my emotions, I am going to frame this petty decision into an acceptable narrative to justify to myself and HR that I am not actually evil.



2- “No margin, no mission.”
Literal Meaning: Without profit, we can’t fulfill our purpose.

Real Meaning: We are about to cut something you like: Pay, Support, Coffee, toilet paper, plastic cups, some people- And we want to blame you and the numbers for it. If you had worked better, we would not be in this situation, but we are kind enough not to blame you directly.


3- “Headwinds.”

Literal Meaning: External conditions are tough.

Real Meaning: We ignored every single warning about this for two years up until now. Now that shit has hit the fan, we are going to blame the tooth fairy for our own overinflated ego and naïveté.


4- “It’s not downsizing, it’s rightsizing.”

Literal Meaning: We’re resizing the company to the right level.

Real Meaning: We like gaslighting ourselves. We made huge mistakes in budgeting and strategy, then hired a McKinsey consultant in order to come up with a fancy phrase to justify letting people go. The saved money from firing people might just cover the consulting fee.


5- “Change is good.”

Literal meaning: Change creates new opportunities.

Real meaning: You are being restructured for the 7th time this quarter. Your team is broken apart, your role is unstable, and you should set your LinkedIn profile to “Open to Work.”


6- “We’re doing a culture reset.”

Literal meaning: We’re improving our culture.

Real meaning: We’re getting rid of some people we don’t like, but we do not have the balls to call it that; so we are using fancy words like culture to sound not evil.


7- “Doing more with less.”

Literal meaning: We need to be more efficient with fewer resources.

Real meaning: We are going to let 50% of the company go. Those who stay now have to work twice as much, always be available, and say goodbye to any work outside this stupid building. You are welcome.


8- “Cost containment.”

Literal meaning: We have to control expenses.

Real meaning: Your salary, your team, your tools, your perks - these are the “costs” that we are going to cut. Leadership compensation, offsites, fancy lunches, and those colorful HR shits on every wall are just “strategic investment.”


9- “Our employees are our greatest asset.”

Literal meaning: Our people matter most.

Real meaning: We’re about to treat “our greatest asset” like a disposable line item. But we’re saying this now to have it in the bank, so the press release does not make us sound like the insufferable assholes you know we are - and we know we are.


10- “We need to optimize workflow.”

Literal meaning: We want to improve processes.

Real meaning: We’re going to remove steps, people, safety checks, QA, payment processing, testing, customer support, etc. And then act surprised later when everything breaks.",1,1764513177.0,OfficePolitics,0,1.0,False

My first working day  in Koln. 

The river splitting and running through the city reminds me of home.

I feel at ease, and very much at home since I left home. 

Except. 

[https://youtu.be/6NXnxTNIWkc?si=O23ZrNpGgM1ONjGg](https://youtu.be/6NXnxTNIWkc?si=O23ZrNpGgM1ONjGg)

Everywhere I turn, the blonde German frauleins keep disturbing my mind.

' Why and how did it become my weakness? 

' When and how great is my weakness for blondes?

 I know who to blame. Like many others I grew up with brothers.

And, like many familiar stories, growing up with elder brothers ,I blame them.

I grew up with men's magazines strewn about their room, flipping through  magazines almost always featuring mostly nude blondes. 

And a good many of them featuring undressed blonde German girls. 

Or, at least with German sounding names, like Brigitte.

' And I am now in the land where blondes are born? '

The joke goes, ' The Germans  manufacture blondes like they put Volkswagen cars, which means people's cars, on the road.

But, laugh as much as you will.

 I am as sure on my death, on my deathbed, should a post-mortem be done on my death, the cause of death will be certified as ‘ due to intoxication by the sight of blondes.’

But reality is the surest way to speak to your mind. 

My first meeting of the day with my German associates.

Make it two. It's a family company, and they are brothers.

From the same ' made in Germany ' factory.

They look like they have been delivered from Hitler’s order sheet of how German men should look like when we shook hands.

Minus  Hitler's moustache.

Again, it is now admitted in the history books, Hitler, at the height of the Nazi rule, ordered German mothers to give birth to the perfect German specie.

Blonde and blue eyed.

The Nazis depict the perfect Aryan descent being someone with blond hair and blue eyes. 

The Nazi regime promoted these traits as part of their ideal master race.

The Nazi regime, according to the history books, decreed that The 'German Race' which was dubbed the ' Aryan Race ' was superior to any other race.

A friend from home who now lives, and prefers Paris as his home, once joked,' The German blondes purr, just like their Porsche cars. Not like our French girls who delight in teasing you.'

It raced through my mind for that instant if I was standing in front of one of Hitler's creations coming alive, maybe through another Nazi propaganda, added with free German education, and eugenics policies.

'Is this,  tall, athletic men with blonde hair and blue eyes standing in front of me, part of Hitler's last orders, come alive?

How the physical 'master race ' should should look like?

After a 1.5-year live-in relationship, a breakup, several disasters, and moving into a space alone, my life is different now, No friends, no pubs, no weekend vibes.

It’s just morning coffee, calisthenics and stretches, the office, books, writing, and seriousness with life. No alcohol, no cigarettes, No burning money.

Though I'm not saving vast amounts of money, I make sure to spend it on things that I truly love or that bring me genuine happiness. Weekends are now regular, I hit Netflix, enjoy good food, talk to my parents, and end up on the bed dreaming about something BIG and a great future.

# SO

Stop listening to others who only cause procrastination and bad influence. I'm not saying my friends are inherently bad, but you eventually need to transition to a better, more disciplined lifestyle after a certain point. I'm in my late 20s, and I felt this was absolutely essential for me.

I’m J. I’m poly and partnered (35f). I live in Ohio and probably prefer someone who also lives in the state, but open to chatting with people in the USA, especially any surrounding states.  My partner and I actually met on Reddit, so I do have some hope something may spring from this! 

I am pan, however I mostly have experience dating cis women, but I am open to dating all genders/identities. After cis women, I’d say have the next most experience with trans men, but again I’m open to anyone. I’m interested in what’s between your ears, not your legs. Although I will say preference wise, I’m not particularly looking for anyone ace, but that’s just a preference of mine.

I am 420 friendly (my partner and I enjoy partaking in edibles), I’m much more likely to be zooted than drink (probably only do that a couple times per year). It’s not a big part of my life but it is something I enjoy on occasion.

I’m childfree and plan on staying that way. 

I love music and musical theatre, going to the movies (if you know the Nicole Kidman speech, you already have my heart), going bowling, museums and perusing a local bookstore and buying overpriced coffee.


Here are some ideas for dates that I’ve never done (but would like to)

Going to a drag show (and getting ice cream after)

Doing an escape room (and getting ice cream after)

Going to a karaoke bar (and getting ice cream after)

Taking each other to an art museum (and getting ice cream after)

Take me to your favorite place (and getting ice cream after)

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Im a new animal care specialist and last week i was in our animal side room with my olac(?) doing whatever, when we hear our boss telling someone off for catching him pouring his dunks coffee into the ferret cage!!! This dude was trying to say thats not what he did and bla bla bla, but she wasnt having it. 
A couple mins go by and i walk out to grab something and this guy started apologizing and shit to me as well, i just explained to him that you shouldn’t ever feed things to animals you dont know, and that coffee is toxic to most if not all pets. And yes, even decaf, since apparently he didnt think decaf was a problem. In the moment i forgot to consider if the coffee had dairy, sugar etc in it thats also an issue of its own, but i digress. His claim was that he was just letting them sniff it off his finger, but that really doesn’t help his case imo😒 he then proceeded to go on some sob story about how he feels so bad for them living in a tiny tank and “theyre his buddies”that he always visits on his work break. As someone whose owned ferrets half my life, i get it man, but be so forreal! he also admitted be “may have” dropped something in there once, which we think is a cheeto since a while back someone found a mystery cheeto in the ferret cage. Safe to say if he comes back hes probably getting banned. Also, enjoy a cute photo of them for critter tax/attention.

But here’s where I’m really confused.... I saw posts claiming they’re back together, and in her lash training post she’s suddenly wearing this big, fake, gaudy ring?? Like… what is that even supposed to mean? Is she hinting at something? Did she confirm anything anywhere?

I just wanna make sure my friend isn’t about to walk straight into a disaster zone, because she does not need to get blown up the way his ex went after that poor 19-year-old.

 History


 Origins

In 2079, beneath the rainy, neon-pulsing skies of São Paulo – a metropolis already intertwined with the first waves of alien technology, where advertising holograms floated alongside autonomous delivery drones – grew up Kenyel Kurosawa Torres. Son of Aurora Torres, a hybrid systems engineer who fused terrestrial circuits with galactic technology, and Renzo Kurosawa, a precision craftsman who forged blades adaptable to variable gravities, Kenyel entered a world on the boil. His maternal grandmother, Verdona, an Anodite of ancient lineage, rarely appeared, but when she did, her ethereal eyes lingered on him with a subtle affection, contrasting with the coldness she reserved for Aurora for her affinity with mana. Verdona saw a rare balance in Kenyel: without the mystical gift, he was free from the weights that those in power are responsible for, and she whispered, in sporadic visits, that his mind was ""a lighthouse that will illuminate many"".

Kenyel's childhood was a mosaic of urban contrasts: the streets of La Boca, Argentina, with their gleaming metallic facades and markets where human vendors bargained with Tentacle merchants, echoed with the hum of maglev trains and the chant of AI algorithms that narrated galactic legends. Aurora, with her voice modulated by vocal implants, weaved tales of Plumber heroes to entertain the children, but behind the stories hovered resentment against Verdona – an absence that manifested itself in tense silences during holographic calls. At the age of six, the family balance broke down. Gwendoline, the youngest of the twins, still a baby, suffered an uncontrolled mana surge: a wave of vital energy that cracked windows and overloaded local power grids, a rare echo of her Anodite potential. The incident, although isolated, sounded like a warning – a reminder of the fragility that mana imposed on those who wielded it without full control. Renzo, pragmatic and aware of the risks, insisted on moving to Brazil, seeking the expertise of Maximus Torres, Aurora's father and an almost mythical figure among the Plumbers.

In Recife, a coastal city transformed into a hub of galactic integration – with orbital observation towers rising like black glass sentinels and mixed communities of humans and species like Piscis Volan coralum living together in elevated neighborhoods –, the family reestablished itself. Maximus, the ""Master of the Stars"", a veteran Plumber whose reputation preceded his aged silhouette scarred from interplanetary battles, became the pivot of the new life. Aurora saw him as too absent, a ghost of galactic duties who prioritized the cosmos over home, but for Kenyel, at 16, Maximus was a portal. Introduced as an assistant trainee at the local Plumbing base, Kenyel immersed himself in quantum network simulations, organizing patrol data while protecting his twin sisters, Angeline and Gwendoline – four years younger –, and cousin Benjamin, with simulated ""missions"" on the high rooftops of Recife. These games, armed with homemade drone prototypes, forged his tactical mind: he mapped escape routes between floating towers, anticipating ""attacks"" from urban shadows, planting the seeds of a born strategist.


The Torres-Kurosawa family was a forge of resilience, tempered by impending loss and strong bonds. Aurora, with her hands calloused with quantum soldering, instilled in Kenyel a fascination with technological convergence – nights spent dismantling alien relays at improvised tables, where she explained how circuits could ""connect"" everyone without the dangers of mana. But her lack of full mana affinity—an imbalance that made her vulnerable to toxic buildups—hung like a shadow, a reminder that power could corrode from the inside out. Renzo, with his stoic calm and painstaking precision, counterbalanced this with lessons in discipline: nighttime training sessions with adaptive blades, where father and son dueled in the dim light, turning movements into lessons in control and legacy. This shared passion – energetic blades – solidified a relationship of deep complicity, a refuge where Kenyel learned that strength was not brutality, but balance.

Maximus emerged as the architect of his rise: his grandfather, whose legend among the Plumbers was echoed in accounts of negotiations with the newly formed Galactic Council, guided Kenyel from inexperienced assistant – calibrating sensors on routine missions against space pirates – to IT Division prodigy. Aurora, however, harbored a veiled hurt over Maximus' absence during family crises, an echo that Kenyel absorbed in silence. Rook Blonko, a meticulous Revnian recruit who joined the Recife base, evolved from reluctant colleague to steadfast confidant: nights of tactical simulations turned into confessions about the weight of duty, forging a friendship. Elena Valadus, the chief bioengineering scientist with her mind as sharp as a precision laser, awakened in Kenyel an unadmitted affection – a fascination with his tireless dedication to human-machine fusions, repressed by an emotional block that saw any distraction as weakness. With her sisters, Kenyel's protective instinct was visceral: Angeline, the most restless, asked at age 13 to train with Verdona, and Renzo, after deliberation, allowed it, letting her attend with her sister and grandmother. Kenyel, tormented by the fear that her lack of control – less polite than Gwendoline's – could lead her to the same poison that threatened Aurora, monitored her progress via encrypted channels, an anxiety that consumed him on sleepless nights. Gwendoline, on the other hand, proved an anchor: after the childhood outburst, she became a model of control, centered and reflective, guided by Verdona who, in a rare visit, assured the family that such stability made poisoning ""impossible – the mana flows like a tamed river in you"". Verdona, surprisingly, reserved genuine affection for Kenyel, seeing his absence of mana as a blessing of clarity, and sharing advice on cosmic balance. Benjamin, the charismatic cousin, was the emotional foil: Kenyel served as his logistical support and anchor, helping him navigate the weight of growing galactic prominence.


At the age of 23, in 2102, the fabric of the family was irreversibly torn. As an advanced intern under the tutelage of Maximus – now immersed in communications protocols for Earth's membership negotiations with the Galactic Council – Kenyel was summoned back to Recife during Aurora's agony. At 42, she succumbed to a chronic accumulation of ""wild"" mana: residual flows from suppressing and repudiating her anodite nature ate away at her neural system, resisting injections and biochemical filters that Kenyel frantically coded in laboratories. He watched the monitors flash with relentless data—curves of life energy collapsing like overloaded grids—vowing in whispers that he would rewrite the code of the universe to save her. But mana, capricious and uncontrollable, won. His death was not an abrupt end but a slow erosion, leaving Kenyel with a deep emotional block: losses now manifested as voids, which he filled with obsessive work, avoiding the raw grief that would paralyze him.

The funeral, under artificial showers of luminescent particles, tore the family seams apart. Renzo, devastated, directed his pain at Maximus, blaming his absences on their failure to bring in expertise in time – an accusation that echoed in tense discussions. Angeline, already under Verdona's tutelage, deepened her training and would leave, while Gwendoline, with her newly established stability, became the pillar at home. Kenyel, catapulted to early leadership, took on communications protocols on real missions: calibrating networks for patrols against incipient threats from Melinesapien smugglers. He transformed grief into strong determination, proving himself indispensable to the Plumbers and honoring the legacy of Maximus – the grandfather who, despite his perceived flaws, had introduced him to a cosmos he now swore to protect. This emotional block, however, took root: losses were not processed, but filed away as system failures, propelling it forward with an efficiency that masked the emptiness.



The year 2102 marked not just personal loss, but the threshold of a transformative era. Four years later, in 2106, Earth was accepted into the Galactic Council after arduous negotiations led by Maximus and allies like Benjamin, triggering a technological boom that rewrote the planet. Cities like Buenos Aires and Recife have further metamorphosed into Hypertechnological ecosystems: adamantium skyscrapers intertwined with bio-luminous vines of galactic species, streets where humans traded neural implants with Galvan merchants, and skies ridden with fleets of Plumber patrol ships. Kenyel, now 27, rose in the Communications and Technology Division, engineering defenses against the shadows of this new world: quantum firewalls that shielded networks against incursionist hackers, and integration protocols that allowed aliens and humans to share data without cultural friction.

But galactic prosperity has brought storms. In 2110 the war against Vilgax erupted as a cascade of systemic failures: the warlord, with his cybernetic Iron Legion, targeted Earth's adamantium core as a trophy and its prime location. Kenyel, at 31, became the invisible architect of defenses: organizing hybrid armies via neural implants, shielding communications against drone interference and planning ambushes on border asteroids, always alongside Rook – now an inseparable partner, whose loyalty was proven on dangerous missions – and Elena, whose genius in bioengineering complemented her codes with organic innovations. The destruction of Arburia, a border outpost, was a visceral blow: Kenyel-programmed evacuation drones failed an EMP pulse, costing thousands of lives. Amazement consumed him in loops of post-mortem analysis, an echo of his emotional block that prevented him from processing guilt beyond cold optimizations.

Ethical dilemmas multiplied like viruses in a network. The Osmosians – Experiments infused with alien and Benjamin DNA, created behind the scenes by the Council to carry out kamikaze attacks on Vilgax's hordes – represented an abomination to Kenyel: Creations of a traitor, a Stain in the memory of the Hero of the galaxy, just tools for a war that is already over. Internal betrayals eroded trust: Proctor Servantis manipulated hidden agendas, while Albedo, the criminal renegade Galvanian genius, sabotaged protocols with chaotic genius. The climax came in 2114, at the Battle of the Null Void: Benjamin, the galactic hero whose oratory had united divided factions, led the charge with the Nullifier – a weapon of mass containment created by Azmuth. Kenyel coordinated from an orbital command ship, his heart synchronized with monitors like an overclocked processor. Vilgax's trap detonated: Benjamin sacrificed himself, exploding into a controlled singularity that swallowed the tyrant. ""Let's make every chance count,"" his last words transmitted via ComLink, burned themselves into Kenyel's neural implant like an eternal loop, feeding a guilt he archived, not healed. Post-war, remaining cells of the Legion haunted the cybernetic fringes of Earth, forcing Kenyel into obsessive vigilance – monitoring her sisters' mana via remote sensors, fearing that Angeline's lack of control, even tamed by Verdona, could echo Aurora's fate.

At 34, Kenyel manages the Plumbers' IT Division from an orbital base over the Atlantic—a floating nexus of interconnected holograms and simulation rooms where humans and aliens debate ethical algorithms under domes of stellar transparency. The post-accession boom transformed Earth into a vibrant cauldron: megacities like Nova Recife pulsed with quantum implant markets, where Revnians like Rook traded parts with pilostran blacksmiths, and Elena led bio-tech fusion labs that healed war wounds with self-replicating nanites. Kenyel enhances firewalls against remaining incursions, trains newcomers in hybrid tactics, and mediates interplanetary crises – such as disputes over communication spectrum between mixed colonies. His methodical routines underpin this efficiency: 5am wake-ups for exercise sequences in simulated gravity, AI-calibrated meals for neural optimization, and blade workouts with Renzo via holographic link, where precise movements serve as an anchor against emotional emptiness. His goal is to build unbeatable networks – a galactic web that protects family and cosmos – while repressing his affection for Elena in sharp professional interactions, and honoring Maximus with innovations that extend his legacy. Verdona, in sporadic communications, praises him as ""the balance,"" a subtle balm against her fears for her sisters: Gwendoline, now a centered field operator, and Angeline, whose remote mastery alleviates but does not erase her anxiety.


In 2116, at the age of 37, Kenyel enters alone the lost sanctuary beneath the Andes Mountains, a place where the last person to find him was 200 years ago. Azmuth had taken Ascalon back from the Galactic Council and hidden her there, sealed by a quantum enigma that would only open to someone of fair mind. For three centuries the sword observed bearers with potential until its second bearer arrived. When Kenyel's hand touches the hilt, the white blade awakens, recognizes it and accepts it. There is no decree, there is no human choice. The weapon chooses. And he chose him.

In that instant, Kenyel becomes the ""Holy King"", also called ""White Seraphim""—a title reserved only for the legendary founder of the Forever Knights, Sir George, the only one the sword had ever accepted before.

The Forever Knights were reborn with a vengeance when the first waves of alien refugees arrived on Earth. With the second and third waves, and especially when the war against Vilgax turned the planet into the largest strategic target in the galaxy, the order came out of the shadows. At first they watched in silence. Then they began to act: selective assassinations, attacks, sabotage in alien neighborhoods, all to force the extraterrestrials to flee and hand over the Earth unprotected to the conqueror.

When Ascalon lights up white in Kenyel's hands, the seven champions of the order face him in ritual combat within the sanctuary itself. Within minutes, plasma-reinforced medieval armor, energy shields, and ancient pride are cut through like paper. The blade that tears apart reality speaks louder than any words. The knights kneel. Not because they were defeated, but because the sword chose — and their law is clear: obey the choice of the weapon.

Kenyel accepts the crown, but imposes total reform.  
He knows that the veterans, hardened by centuries of hatred against “freaks” like Dagon and alien invaders, will never completely change. But the young, the squires and the new generations will learn the correct path: joint training with alien Plumbers, protocols that punish any act of supremacy, mixed missions that prove, in practice, that strength comes from unity.

In a few years, the Forever Knights cease to be a xenophobic brotherhood and become the ""Seraph Guard"", the armored vanguard of the Plumbers, loyal only to the Holy King.

Kenyel now wields the most dangerous weapon ever created by Azmuth—a scientific sword capable of shattering entire planets if used without restraint. He doesn't hold her for ambition, glory, or emotional redemption. Hold it because someone needs to hold it so it never has to be used that way.

And every night, before closing his eyes, he repeats the phrase he has had engraved in his soul since Benjamin's death:

«Let's make every chance count.»


Allies: Rook Blonko (Best friend); Elena Valadus ( Your Love); Maximus Torres (grandfather, inspirational mentor); Renzo Kurosawa (father, master of discipline and swords); Gwendoline and Angeline (sisters and confidants).  
Enemies: Remnants of the Iron Legion; Proctor Servantis (traitor); Albedo (rival); Forever Knights (initial rivals, their King).
