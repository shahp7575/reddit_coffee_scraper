I would lie down exhausted, but my mind seemed to come alive as soon as my head hit the pillow. Thoughts would race about everything‚Äîwork, bills, even conversations I had days ago. It only made me more frustrated, and the few hours of sleep I managed were often interrupted.

That‚Äôs when I realized I needed to change my relationship with sleep. I started by identifying the causes of my insomnia. I discovered that late-day caffeine was a major culprit, so I swapped my afternoon coffee for chamomile tea. I also made myself turn off screens at least an hour before bed. It was tough at first, but I soon noticed the difference.

I adopted a simple nighttime routine: a warm shower, a light book, and a quiet, dark room. Gradually, my body began to recognize when it was time to wind down. Surprisingly, small changes during the day‚Äîlike exercising in the morning and practicing deep breathing at night‚Äîmade a big impact.

Ever find yourself scrolling mindlessly through your phone instead of tackling that to-do list? üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (Guilty as charged here.) How about turning that distraction device into a focus-boosting powerhouse? Let‚Äôs talk **mindfulness apps**‚Äîthe secret weapon you didn‚Äôt know you needed to work smarter, not harder.

First things first: why mindfulness apps? Well, we all know that focusing can be as tricky as herding cats. But with a little tech help, you can transform your phone from foe to friend in your battle against distraction.

Here are a few gems I've tried and tested:

1. **Headspace** üöÄ  
   Ever caught yourself thinking about unicorns during a meeting? Headspace can help you refocus with guided meditations and mindfulness exercises. Perfect for those moments when your brain decides to spontaneously combust.
   
2. **Calm** üåä  
   Feeling stressed? Calm offers soothing nature sounds and bedtime stories narrated by the likes of Matthew McConaughey. Who knew getting rockstar-level sleep could be so chill?

3. **Insight Timer** üï∞Ô∏è  
   You want variety? This app has over 45,000 free meditations. It‚Äôs like Netflix for meditation (just without the endless scrolling and decision fatigue).

4. **Forest** üå≥  
   Hate feeling guilty for using your phone? With Forest, you grow a tree every time you resist the urge to check your phone. At the end of a productive day, you've got a whole forest. It's environmental activism and productivity in one neat package!

5. **Simple Habit** üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
   Only got five minutes? This app is for those quick mental resets when you need to get back in the groove fast, ideally before your coffee gets cold.

I know, sometimes it feels like we‚Äôre living in the age of distraction. But what if I told you that focusing your mind could be as easy as downloading the right app? What if the tool you need is just a tap away? 

So, friends, which app are you going to try next? Or perhaps you‚Äôve got a hidden gem of your own to share? Let‚Äôs light up the comments with your experiences and see what mindfulness magic we can unlock together. üòä

It was during a routine medical check-up, one of those you do more for peace of mind than out of real concern. As the doctor reviewed my tests, he casually mentioned, ‚ÄúYour cholesterol levels are a bit high, and there are signs of insulin resistance. It‚Äôs nothing serious yet, but it‚Äôs something to keep an eye on.‚Äù That caught me off guard. I had always considered myself a normal person with ‚Äúaverage‚Äù eating habits. I never thought that at 30 years old, I‚Äôd hear the word ‚Äúpre-diabetes.‚Äù

I left the office somewhat shocked, trying to process what it all meant. In the days that followed, I started paying closer attention to my habits and realized they were far from healthy. Breakfast? White bread with butter and coffee loaded with sugar. Lunch? The quickest option possible, usually something fried or ultra-processed. Dinner? Pizza or anything that required little effort. Exercise? Only when I had to run to catch the bus.

I decided I couldn‚Äôt ignore the warning. I started small, almost hesitantly. I swapped white bread for whole grain, even though I found the taste strange at first. I began adding fruits to my breakfast‚Äîsomething so simple, yet it made a huge difference. I signed up for a yoga class, and I remember that during the first week, my muscles were so sore I almost gave up. But somehow, I kept going.

After a few weeks, I noticed subtle changes: I woke up feeling more energetic, my clothes started to fit better, and my mood, which used to be so unstable, felt more balanced. That gave me the motivation to keep going.

It wasn‚Äôt a linear journey. There were moments when I slipped‚Äîa weekend of fast food or an entire week without exercising. But instead of giving up, I learned to start again. I realized that health isn‚Äôt about being perfect but about making conscious choices most of the time.

Today, I look back and feel proud of how I‚Äôve transformed my life. I didn‚Äôt just lower my cholesterol and stabilize my glucose levels; I gained something even more valuable: a relationship of care and respect for my body. I learned that every meal, every walk, and every good night‚Äôs sleep is an act of self-love. And that, more than any blood test result, is the greatest indicator of health I could have.",1,1736611517.0,Vitalconnection,0,1.0,False

I've started bodyweight exercises at home since last 2 weeks. I am motivated enough to stick to my exercise routine but my diet has is giving me a lot of problems. I live alone and having a tiffin from an aunty who lives in the same building. Below is me detailed diet.

After exercise - 1 cup ON protein powder 

Breakfast - 2 tbsp yogabar health mix, either one of 1 plate poha, upma, idli, sabudana khichdi or medu vada, 1 cup of coffee with milk and 3 tsp sugar

Lunch - 2 chapati, 1 cup sabji, 1 cup daal (included in the tiffin), 2 boiled eggs

Evening snacks - 1 cup of tea with milk and sugar 3 tsp, either 1 apple and handful of peanuts or a sevpuri, I also eat Chicken Shawarma on the weekends in evening 

Dinner - 1 chapati, half cup of dal, half cup of sabji (included in tiffin), 2 boiled eggs

My weight has been fluctuating between 91kg and 92kg with this diet. I'm willing to change it to make it more healthy but I'm overwhelmed with information. Also, apart from the tiffin, whatever I have listed here, I eat it in the outside shops.

I've posted on this sub about my ex friend Julia before. The overwhelming majority of comments on that post said to cut ties with her because she wasn't a true friend, and that's what I did. I haven't spoken to or heard from her in years at this point.

My friends and I organized a trip to a ski resort with an outdoors hot tub. One of the guys in the group (Brian) is dating Julia's sister (Becky), and we all agreed she was welcome to come along. The resort is quite remote: there is a shuttle service that operates once a week, but otherwise the only way to get there is by car. We went with two cars: Brian driving one, and Mark driving another.

When we stopped for coffee midway through, Brian walked out with Becky and Julia, whom no one expected to be there. It was quite awkward initially, but no one commented other than the usual ""it's been a while.""

When we got to the resort, I'd booked a single bedroom for myself but then Becky said I would have to share with her instead because Julia snored and needed a separate room. We then went to the hot tub, and Julia was one of the first people to excuse herself; I came back to my portion of the room in a state, as if someone had gone through my bags. I suspect it was her but have no proof and nothing seems to be missing, so I let it go as I know she'd ruin everyone's holiday if I accused her.

I also overheard her talk to Mark about how much weight I'd gained over the years, how ballsy it was of me to wear a bikini (it's the only swimsuit I have fml), and how much she was looking forward to seeing me tumble down the slopes.

Mark obviously then told me and, after I mentioned the suitcase thing, he offered to drive me back. He also said he found Julia obnoxiously clingy, and that he would also rather go home than to have to put up with her for the rest of the weekend.

I may be TA as I could be overreacting, and I'd be cutting Mark's holiday short too. We'd all agreed to split the costs evenly at the end, but, by us leaving first, the others would end up paying more for the rest of the trip. I also have no idea how the other guys would get back with only one car.

Ah, Bitcoin‚Äîthe currency of rebels, tech wizards, and anyone who‚Äôs ever dreamed of shouting ‚ÄúTo the moon!‚Äù at their digital wallet. It‚Äôs the future of money, but did you know it‚Äôs also the future of generosity? Enter the **Bitcoin Donate Button**, your one-stop solution for accepting Bitcoin donations effortlessly and stylishly.

Whether you‚Äôre a creator, a nonprofit, or just someone with a big heart and a website, our app is here to turn your visitors into donors faster than you can say ‚Äúblockchain.‚Äù Let‚Äôs dive into the why, the how, and the endless possibilities of accepting Bitcoin donations.

# Why Accept Bitcoin Donations?

First, let‚Äôs talk about why you should embrace Bitcoin as your new best friend in the world of philanthropy.

# 1. Global Reach Without Boundaries

Bitcoin knows no borders. Unlike traditional payment methods tied to banks or specific currencies, Bitcoin is universal. Your donors in Japan, Germany, or Antarctica (penguin activists, anyone?) can support you with a single click.

# 2. Low Fees = More for You

Who loves transaction fees? Absolutely no one. Traditional donation platforms often skim off a percentage of your contributions. Bitcoin‚Äôs minimal fees ensure that more of what‚Äôs given actually reaches you.

# 3. Privacy Matters

Some donors prefer to stay anonymous. Bitcoin makes that easy while still keeping transactions secure and traceable on the blockchain. It‚Äôs the perfect balance of privacy and transparency.

# 4. Future-Proof Your Cause

Bitcoin is more than a currency‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement. By accepting Bitcoin donations, you show you‚Äôre forward-thinking, tech-savvy, and ready for the future of finance.

# How the Bitcoin Donate Button Works

Now, let‚Äôs get to the fun part: how our **Bitcoin Donate Button** makes accepting crypto donations as smooth as butter on warm toast.

# Step 1: Set It Up in Minutes

Our app doesn‚Äôt believe in complications. You don‚Äôt need to be a coding genius or a blockchain expert to integrate the Bitcoin Donate Button into your website. Just follow these simple steps:

1. Visit [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/).
2. Enter your Bitcoin wallet address.
3. Customize your button‚Äôs design to match your site‚Äôs aesthetic.
4. Copy the generated code and paste it into your website.

Voil√†! Your Bitcoin Donate Button is live and ready for action.

# Step 2: Watch the Donations Roll In

Once your button is up, all your visitors need to do is click it, scan the QR code, and send their donation. It‚Äôs seamless, intuitive, and faster than ordering a coffee at your favorite caf√©.

# Who Can Benefit from Bitcoin Donations?

Spoiler alert: Pretty much everyone. But here‚Äôs a closer look at how different groups can leverage our Bitcoin Donate Button:

# 1. Content Creators

Bloggers, podcasters, YouTubers‚Äîyour fans love your work, so why not give them an easy way to support you? Adding a Bitcoin Donate Button to your site or channel is a no-brainer.

# 2. Nonprofits

Running a nonprofit is no easy feat, and every dollar (or satoshi) counts. Accepting Bitcoin donations opens up your cause to a global audience and ensures more of their contributions go directly to your mission.

# 3. Small Businesses

Even small businesses can benefit from Bitcoin donations. Think of it as a modern-day tip jar for your loyal customers who want to show their appreciation.

# 4. Open-Source Projects

Developers creating tools for the greater good deserve some love too. With a Bitcoin Donate Button, your supporters can help fund your projects and keep innovation alive.

# Real-Life Scenarios: Bitcoin Donation Magic

Let‚Äôs take a peek at some real-life scenarios where the Bitcoin Donate Button shines like a freshly minted crypto coin.

# 1. The Blogger Extraordinaire

Meet Jane, a travel blogger with a knack for uncovering hidden gems. Her audience loves her work, and she loves sharing it for free. But keeping the blog running comes with costs.

With our Bitcoin Donate Button, Jane can accept donations from readers across the globe. Whether it‚Äôs $5 worth of Bitcoin from a fan in Brazil or $50 from a crypto enthusiast in Germany, Jane‚Äôs efforts are rewarded with ease.

# 2. The Eco-Warrior Nonprofit

Imagine a nonprofit dedicated to saving rainforests. They‚Äôve got a loyal base of donors, but traditional donation platforms eat into their funds with fees.

By switching to Bitcoin donations, they save money on fees and attract a new wave of tech-savvy, eco-conscious supporters. Thanks to the Bitcoin Donate Button, their mission gets the boost it needs.

# Tips for Maximizing Bitcoin Donations

Want to get the most out of your Bitcoin Donate Button? Here are some tips to make it a smashing success:

# 1. Educate Your Audience

Not everyone is familiar with Bitcoin, and that‚Äôs okay. Add a simple FAQ section to your site explaining how to donate with Bitcoin and why it‚Äôs awesome.

# 2. Promote Your Button

Don‚Äôt be shy! Share your Bitcoin Donate Button on social media, newsletters, and anywhere else your audience hangs out. The more visible it is, the more likely people are to use it.

# 3. Thank Your Donors

A little gratitude goes a long way. Whether it‚Äôs a personalized email, a shoutout on social media, or a simple thank-you message, let your donors know their contributions are appreciated.

# The Future of Giving is Here

The world is changing, and so is the way we give. Bitcoin donations aren‚Äôt just a trend‚Äîthey‚Äôre a glimpse into the future of philanthropy and support. With our **Bitcoin Donate Button**, you‚Äôre not just keeping up with the times; you‚Äôre leading the charge.

1hyysja,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1hyysja/my_best_friend_of_21_years_did_me_dirty_and_idk/,My best friend of 21 years did me dirty and idk how to move forward,"So let‚Äôs go back to December 2024; it‚Äôs my birthday and I run in a very small circle. I invite my fianc√©, my best friend, her sister, and their boyfriends out to dinner and a drink or two after to celebrate. (Important background info this is the restaurant my late dad introduced and took me too every year since I was like 15). I plan a month in advance as to be respectful of everyone‚Äôs schedule and make sure everyone can set aside the time to come. 3 days before the dinner I was hanging out with my best friend and she began to tell me that the last time I saw her partner as soon as I left he talked shit about me and then she proceeded to tell me how ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt want her to get a drink with me afterwards‚Äù at first because he didn‚Äôt want to come so I trouble shot that we could drive her then it became about his insecurities and paranoia and how he couldn‚Äôt handle her in the city possibly getting hit on (at this point I‚Äôm seeing all the obvious red flags and being super open with her about them and telling her I‚Äôm having a hard time emotionally this time of year, I don‚Äôt have family, she‚Äôs my family, and this dinner and going out means everything to me) mind you these are all plans she already agreed to a month ago and then confirmed again. Then the night of the dinner comes. She has minimal communication with me beforehand but when we do talk it‚Äôs, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôre you gonna wear to the bar tonight‚Äù ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the vibe‚Äù sending pics of makeup looks and talking about the literally bar we were going to (we also haven‚Äôt been OUT together in a year because of her controlling partner) we all meet up and apparently my best friend, her sister, and their boyfriends all ended up carpooling. Dinner happens and at the very end as I bring up if we‚Äôre gonna walk the 7 minutes to the bar or drive my best friend next to me goes ‚Äúyeah I think I‚Äôm gonna cancel I‚Äôm tired‚Äù mind you we‚Äôre at an espresso cafe. Weak excuse. I almost thought she was joking. No offer to go back to my place or hers. Nothing just silence. Then all 4 of them go in their phones and my fianc√© and I just stared at each other literally mouth gaped open. I kept shaking my head until I got up and went to the bathroom and she came in and tried to say ‚Äúwell if you really want me to I can try to order extra coffee and hang out it‚Äôs just well only be out for an hour anyways is it really worth it?‚Äù And right then I was done. I told her ‚Äúdon‚Äôt touch me or talk to me‚Äù I went and got a drink and a slice of cake and the check, had others pay, and went home and drank wine with my fianc√©. I cannot explain in short enough text but I have known her for over 20 years and I know she was lying and I saw her smug little partner sitting there at the table and I know she cancelled because of him. Not because of being tired. Especially because I saw her up posting until 3am.

The next day I have a huge, deep heart to heart with her where I am very real and so is she about or feelings and expectations and reality. She says she wants so badly to ‚Äúmake this up to me‚Äù I hate that turn of phrase but she kept using it. She planned to have an entire girls day and then dinner and go to a bar with me for a drink or two the first Saturday in January. She showed up 5 hours late without telling me after there was so much communication leading up about me asking her to not waste my time. She just stayed up late drinking energy drinks with her partner and went to bed at 6 am when she knew she promised to be at my house at 1pm. Whatever. We go to dinner. She has a drink. She proceeds to railroad me and talk about how her partner was begging her not to go. Her partner was begging her to cancel on me again. Last minute. He was making her cry and that‚Äôs part of why she was extra late he was just picking at her while she was crying out the door. He was saying he was mad at her she was making me feel guilty he was texting her shit during our dinner. Then I ask her if she just wants to go home after and she said ‚Äúno he doesn‚Äôt have power over me but this is our last hurrah so let‚Äôs go to the bar‚Äù (kinda contradictory but okay). We go and she tells me she planned on coming to my house and cancelling on me again and she told her partner that she would and she‚Äôs scared of am argument with him because she went out after saying she‚Äôs cancel on me and I shut down after that. I had my fianc√© come get us and drop her off and I full on haven‚Äôt talked to her since. That night I gave her so much love and support while also making it clear that what he does is wrong. 

Her sister has said things about him. Her family has. How I have. Her and I have both been in abusive relationships so I know how it goes so I‚Äôm showing her grace but shes 27 and he‚Äôs 35 and a fucking loser with nothing to offer and I fucking hate him and he‚Äôs making her a terrible person.

1hyysba,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1hyysba/i_31m_need_some_perspective_on_this_whole/,I (31M) need some perspective on this whole situation ,"
So, this is a story about me (31M) and S (27F), a friend of a friend (N), and how things unfolded. I‚Äôll try to keep it concise but complete.


 S is roommate of N. We had a few shared conversations where I noticed some subtle signs‚Äîlong eye contact, playful banter, and even N mentioning later that S had asked if I was single. She even called me a ‚Äúcutie‚Äù in the group it seems N told me. Also she has asked N if I was single. These felt like solid indicators, so I decided to act.

I got S number at a house party N hosted. Our conversations over text started off light but steady. However, I felt the texting wasn‚Äôt going that great‚Äîher responses didn‚Äôt feel fully engaged or consistent. So, I decided to pull back for about a week to give her space and avoid seeming too pushy. At another house party the next week some time, she was very cozy with me and I reached out next week again and eventually asked her out. To my surprise (and relief), she said yes.


We spent about five hours together at the date , and honestly, it was one of the most emotionally significant experiences I‚Äôve had. We connected deeply, talked about family dysfunction (something we both relate to), and shared laughs and quiet moments. There were subtle physical cues‚Äîshoulders brushing, lingering touches‚Äîbut I hesitated to make a move beyond that. She extended the date by suggesting coffee and even brought up potential future plans, which felt promising.


Post-date, the texting dynamic started to feel‚Ä¶ off again. Responses became sporadic, and I struggled to find the balance between giving space and maintaining the connection. Then, N dropped the bomb: S wouldn‚Äôt be interested in anything romantic with me. In the fact she is not sure it will go there. Eventually she‚Äôll come to that was the consensus. It hit hard, especially after what I thought were clear signals, but I had to respect her feelings.


Looking back, I wonder if I misread some of her actions or if she genuinely enjoyed the connection but realized later that it wasn‚Äôt what she wanted romantically. Either way, I‚Äôve decided to let it go and focus on myself. Still, I can‚Äôt shake off the curiosity‚Äîwhat do you guys think? Were her signals mixed, or was I overanalyzing? Did I play this right, or could I have handled things differently? Also I think I mightly overinvested lol coz I was a bit smitten about her.

1hyyrs3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hyyrs3,I sorted the non neon colors from the king art 30 pack gel pens.,"When you look up this product, it has charts with the name of colors in the pictures. They changed the saturation on the pictures so bad that it is hard to tell which color is which for the glitter colors. It's not a problem for the neon glitter colors because the chart for that is in the same order that the pens come in. The photoshop that I did on the second slide is the order that they come in the pack, so it can make it easier to label them. I have the version of the 30 pack where it's one row on top of another in the package. In that package the neon pens are easier to distinguish because they are clear while the non neon have glitter on the barrel. But when they sell the 30 pack all in one row I believe all the pens have sparkles on the barrel. I don't know why, but in the pack that comes in two rows the second and 3rd pen are in the same order of their counterparts for both groupings, while the one row 30 pack has the second and 3rd pen of the neon group switched around. I got the pictures from the one row pack",1,1736610766.0,colors,0,1.0,False
1hyyrmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hyyrmv/aio_for_considering_ending_things_bc_boyfriend_is/,AIO for considering ending things bc Boyfriend is saying demeaning things ,"My boyfriend (32m) is a hardworking wonderful guy. This man literally wakes me up every morning with a cup of coffee and a warm house bc he built a fire (Colorado ski town). I do the cooking, he does the cleaning. He does the shoveling. I clean as well but I'd be lying if I said I do as much as him. When we do trips he takes the lead on prepping and planning. We regularly go uphill skiing with our dog and he packs the gear for that. It's worth mentioning that going uphill is his hobby, I don't but if he and the dog didn't want to I would literally never do it. We have a roommate who is supposed to be splitting household chores with him but keeps getting seriously injured. 
The roommate was laid up all last year with a broken back and just seriously injured his knee. The manual labor like shoveling and bringing in wood is clearly not something he can do. I should have picked up on this and started chipping in more, I will in the future. 
My boyfriend recently started working from home and I have been WFH for years. He wakes up early (like 5am) and knocks out a bunch so he's going back and forth between work, skiing and housework throughout the day while I'm chained to my desk 7-3, generally getting up around 6:45am. If the driveway has been shoveled I'll drive to ski after work if not I'll take the shuttle which takes a little longer. I'm not a slob by any means but I will put up with a little clutter for a few hours before I get to it, he will clean things up immediately as he sees them. He's has been a sweet thoughtful partner for the majority of our 2 year relationship that I've felt lucky to have. I've always been/had to be hyper independent. With this relationship Ive been able to relax more and feel like two people are taking care of each other instead of being a perpetual care taker. I relaxed a bit too much and need to step up my game to make things more equitable -Ive acknowledged and conveyed my willingness to do that. We're currently on a trip (work trip for me) so there's nothing I can do immediately to act on that. 

He's been in a mood and been speaking to me in a tone that makes me feel like he hates me. It's been cropping up probably the past month and even a few of his friends/roommate have mentioned it to him (roommate is his childhood best friend). Since we left for this trip he's been just ripping me to shreds. He claims I make up stories to ""one up"" people. It's completely untrue, I do reciprocate stories to relate to people but I'm not making them up. While I work a pretty conservative job and keep my nose clean I'm ADHD AF and do have a lot of wild stories, they are true though. He called me the equivalent of an attention whore and has made a number of comments disparaging me and being overly critical. For example he was hounding me non-stop about how badly I was snowboarding and how I was so slow, I am not slow by literally anyone's definition. He's faster than me but only maybe one of the other people in the group could even keep up with me but I was the target of all his ire. He was berating me so much that I physically froze up and then I really was a hold up so I went home bc it was just no longer fun. This whole trip he's had a scowl and been gruff. This is the one time I see my coworkers a year and frankly it's embarrassing to bring a partner who is acting like he hates me. I would rather he hadn't come. He's been mad about the stuff at home and held it in till it boiled over. While his frustration is valid, had he addressed it I would have been receptive and pitched in more/expressed my gratitude more frequently for all he does every day. Had he brought legitimate, actionable concerns to me I would have assessed and worked on them but the way he's approached it has me feeling like he's trying to destroy my self confidence. I've spent years trying to overcome my sense of inadequacy from being an olderest daughter in a very conservative family that does not value me in the slightest. For awhile I chose partners who also didn't value me, went to therapy, worked through that and thought I was choosing better -he is, despite this worlds better than my previous partners. I'm considering ending things with him over this. Is this an overreaction or something we should work through?",2,1736610753.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

I'm close to all caught up and the Freebird Tahoe got me thinking of the songs I've heard blasted out of car windows over the years.

We've all heard the Sweet Home Alabamas from Jr's first lifted Silverado and the trap stuff pumped through some busted Beats by Dres, but what are the craziest songs you've heard on the street?

Like, out here, the local college radio will play this awesome polka radio show on weekend mornings, and that's always fun to hear, not unexpected. Not beating this one Harley, an honest to goddamn motorcycle, blasting NPR of all things as it farted through town multiple evenings in the summer one year. Like the driver was sincerely trying to listen to Democracy Now or All Things Considered on their hog ride.

But the best of all had to have been, one fine Saturday morning in April a few years back, I had some wicked insomnia and had been up since before sunrise, just chillin, drinking coffee, listening to the dawn chorus, worse ways to start your day. When around 7 am, not long after sunrise, came this old-ish convertible, like a 911, nothing too fancy or classic, just your typical midlife crisis machine absolutely blasting none other than **Fields of Gold**. Like it rattled my kitchen windows. YOULL REMEMBER ME AS THE WEST WIND MOOOOVES!

I think they stopped at the nearby crosswalk to check their phone or something, so I got at least 30 seconds of Sting to start my day. Thought this must be the craziest car song moment, but then, a few weeks later, same convertible, same time, and what did I hear? You guessed it. **Sussudio**. The man is in his element. I should have gone out to shake his hand. What an experience. Haven't seen or heard him since. Hope he's okay.",5,1736610540.0,PatFinnerty,0,1.0,False

I am going on a fourth date tonight with the first woman I met, and really the only one I liked. So it may be a success, too early to tell. 

But out of dozens of matches, most of them have just faded. It happens. You end up liking and chatting with someone else more, or just change your mind. I have. I stopped responding because I just lost steam. 

I also don‚Äôt like the thought of burning up my free time having coffee with strangers. 

Oh and I‚Äôve had multiple women say ‚Äúyes! I‚Äôd love to meet for coffee, looking forward to it‚Äù.  Then stop responding when I try to set something up. lol. I‚Äôm like, ohhhh kayyy. 

Ok I just had another. Exactly a week ago she sends ‚Äúwould you like to meet?‚Äù   Then I respond by telling her I am coming from a different city, not far away,  but would be willing to meet for coffee near her and ask what days work best. So she replies a whole week later, today ‚Äúthat sounds nice‚Äù.  Dude, I already forgot about you! Gawd. Fun stuff 

So the matches and chats don‚Äôt really  lead to dates but I‚Äôm fine with that. I‚Äôm dating someone now and I‚Äôm enjoying time with her. I don‚Äôt have the energy to multi date anymore.

1hyyjd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1hyyjd3/why_is_he_ignoring_me/,Why is he ignoring me?,"Four months ago, Both David and I moved to another country to start a new job. On the first day at work we, and another colleague, realised that we lived in the same apartment building. So we decided to drive into work together every day. I am more outgoing and sociable. David is socially awkward and more shy. I am well liked at work, while other people find David standoffish.

  
During this time, David and I realised that we got on really well, and there seemed to be a spark between us. Colleagues at work thought that we were together, or that David liked me, He would follow me around work and find excuses to talk to me. One weekend, we went for a coffee. He told me that he had been dating a woman who called her ex husband during one of their dates. He said that now he wouldn't feel bad using her for sex because she had done him wrong. I asked him if casual sex was a repeating pattern for him, and he said that he only ever seems able to have short term relationships. I said 'Does that make you happy?' He said 'No but why can't I just do it and not think about whether it makes me happy?' We had been for drinks with other colleagues but one day, David asked me to go for coffee and we ended up having a day out. During this outing, David was talking about a couple that he knew. He said that they had no 'pizzazz' I joked 'That's what I thought when we met, no pizzazz.' David replied 'Well I thought that we had pizzazz from the start.' I asked him if he was ok and he said 'Yes I just hope everyone finds someone for them.' 

I then reflected upon this and i felt bad for making a joke which reflects differently to how I actually felt.  A week later we were alone on the drive home and David said that we should go to a restaurant that friday. As we were coming into the apartments, I then said 'You know when I said that we didn't have pizzazz? I just wanted to say that I think we do have pizzazz' David smiled and said 'We do have pizzazz, we have a little bit of pizzazz.' I then became uncomfortable and went into the elevator to go home. The next few days were awkward between us, but David would come with me to the supermarket after work whilst I picked up dinner, but didn't mention the previous conversation. I texted him to apologise for my awkwardness and asked him for a coffee. He said he would let me know, but then didn't. I later found out that he was on a date that day. 

After a few weeks, things got back to normal, but David would often decline invitations when Jo invited him out. David created a group chat for a new sport he wanted to play, but I didn't attend the first time. Then David asked me if I wanted to go. I assumed he meant with the group. He said 'Yes we could ask the group. There are some nice restaurants around here.' I said ;Yeah there's a nice Indian.' Later, I wondered whether he had been trying to ask me for dinner. 

One day in the car to work, David and another colleague were talking about the weekend. David told the colleague that he had sex with a woman and he described the woman as crazy. I was visibly upset by this and ignored David. Before this. David had become noticeably moodier. He was less jokey and seemed stressed and upset. For example, he was mildly reprimanded at work and was visibly upset for about a week. I heard that he was starting arguments in meetings. I also became friends with his immediate superior, which seemed to annoy David. He would make comments like 'Why does everyone like you so much?' A few days later I went to see David and I asked him what the matter was, and he said he was tired. I said that I knew he was stressed about work and some other things. I said 'Also I was really rude to you the other day and I'm sorry. I feel like we're on track to being really good friends and I keep on making it awkward. I think its because I've developed feelings for you.' David said 'What, that I annoy you?' I said 'No I mean romantic feelings. But that's fine, David. We can keep on being good friends.' David said 'Well that's something for me to think about. Let's discuss it later.' Later on, David and I went to the shops together but he did not bring up the conversation. 

  
Since then, David looked uncomfortable when we have interacted. I heard the end of a conversation with the other colleague who told David 'Yeah but she's expecting you to do all the work.' We went on a work night out together and David was visibly moody after a while. Another colleague told me that I have really good energy. David said 'Nobody would ever tell mee that I have good energy.' He also made jokes about me being biploar. David told me during the evening that he was having surgery during the christmas break. He said 'So I'm really looking forward to staying in and having some space. Then i'll have surgery, then I'm going to go to a silent retreat to clear my head. Then maybe we can go to see the fireworks on new years, if we can get a group together' and I agreed. During the break from work, I saw David in the apartment foyer dressed well and looking like he was waiitng for someone. He then blanked me a few days later in the mall. Therefore I decided not to text him about his surgery or new years eve. I spent a lot of time debating whether he would want to hear from me. 

  
We have been back at work for a week. David is sometimes friendly when I see him but other times he ignores me. For example, I held the door open for him and he looked at rhe ground and said nothing. I invited him to my birthday party in a f and asked  jokingly if he was excited about it. Today I went out with a friend from work. She told me that David was speaking to others at work about how during the break he had gone to a wedding with a local girl he was seeing, and had met her family there. 

Was he keeping me hanging and now thinks that he has found someone better? I'm upset because I thought that we were genuinely friends. 

Has he shown me respect?

  
I feel like I care too much about him and he is more interested in having sex with other people.

Ate candy

Didn't drink

This morning I woke up to a pissed bed. Not mine but my newly potty trained girl who fell asleep snuggling with Mommy and Me.

Everyone went to the extra bedroom. I stayed up and cleaned and did the laundry.

I didn't get upset on the inside. Sure more sleep is always nice especially being away from the grind but I'm grateful.

In an alternate reality I would be waiting for the liquor store to open to replace the fifth that is now mostly water and drink the other because it can't be wasted. Also get an extra just in case....

In an alternate reality I wet the bed alone.

Instead I'm having some coffee looking out the window on beautiful snow covered mountains while the family gets some extra z's.

I have to replace the bag of Reese's Christmas Trees instead of booze. I don't have to channel my inner Ethan Hunt to get them into the pantry.

She is sweet and having some self-esteem issues. I've helped her with shopping, make-up, fitness training. There is a man at the studio that she likes.  To be fair, I think she is a bit out of his league in terms of looks but is a young lawyer, she makes a good living and holds her own professionally. He is maybe 30-40 years old. I'm 54 but read younger appearance wise and I'm in better shape physically than she is.  To help her, I told her to speak to him casually as she gauges interest. She agreed and I saw her asking him questions. He was smiling so I thought, ok that seems to be progressing nicely.

She normally meets me in the sauna and asks to have coffee but for the last several weeks she's been chilly and walked right by me without saying anything. I know she heard my greeting.

Last night I was putting my mats away and her crush hit on me. He directly asked if I would like to spend some time with him outside the studio.

I was surprised as I am way older than this guy but I do always see him noticing or looking at me. I thought he was just watching my technique or thinking look at the sweaty old chic.

I played dumb said ""Yoga partners are always great to have but I like to be into my own groove. It's less pressure you know?""

And I walked out into the snow.

I wonder if this is why she is angry and I don't know what to do.

2. Tell her, hey the guy asked me out and I said no. I'm too old for him anyway and you have nothing to worry about.

But I remember you (que the cheesy, emotional Skid Row song we used to blast in your Jeep, riding down the parkway.

Your lips tasted like black coffee. You smelled like sawdust and American crew. We spent our first day together in an old aluminum canoe on a pond by the mountains. Some days split our lives into two parts; for me, there‚Äôs everything that came before you, and then there‚Äôs everything that came after. You got into my boat, and I was never the same after that. That night, we kissed for the first time. We sat on my mom‚Äôs front porch while the Memorial Day fireworks thundered over our heads. I think I was already in love with you when our lips met for the first time. 

I'm dealing with a health crisis, some days it's touch and go. So I've been thinking a lot about my life. I just wish I could say I‚Äôm sorry for every way  I hurt you. You were ready for things that terrified me (thanks mom and dad‚Äîfor the broken home, messy divorce, and lifetime of relationship trauma). I‚Äôm sorry I was too young and broken to understand what you meant to me. I loved you. I said the words often enough when we were together, but I never felt the weight of those words until I couldn‚Äôt say them to you anymore. Also, after all we‚Äôd been through, there was a time you came to me; broken-hearted, depressed, and looking for a friend. I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt know how to be that for you. I didn‚Äôt know how to dull my feelings for you into something as blunt as friendship. I wasn‚Äôt that strong. I couldn‚Äôt turn it off. I failed you again, and I‚Äôm so sorry. ¬†I don't have many regrets in this life, but the way I hurt you is one of them. 

Thoughts of you have faded with over twenty years, but honey‚Ä¶ you haunt my sleep. I close my eyes at night and you walk through my dreams. Occasionally, something in the waking world will bring the pain of missing you into sharp focus; the smell of autumn leaves and damp wood, an old yellow jeep passing on the highway, or someone in a crowd who resembles you. It takes my breath away and I‚Äôll feel myself crushed beneath the weight. I‚Äôll always carry the burden of missing your smile and the way you looked at me. 

No one has ever looked at me the way you did.

I‚Äôm not sorry for the time I spent with you; even though it ended in heartbreak.¬†Some small part of me will always be in love with you.

I‚Äôm under no illusions; I know the people we once were no longer exist. They‚Äôve grown older and ceased to be who they were. Most days I‚Äôm fine; my life has had more blessings than anyone deserves. I hope the same is true of you. I get up every day, and I honor the commitments I‚Äôve made in life. I've been 100% faithful in my current situation. Honor your commitments and live your life. Be overwhelmingly happy and blessed where you are. I promise to do the same. I still say a prayer for you every once in a while. Even more often now, since I've been ill. 

I pray that your life has been happy and full.  

That's all really. I love you. I'm sorry. Thank you for the time we spent. I‚Äôm glad that for just a little while,¬† I was able to experience loving *anything* the way I loved you. You gave me some beautiful memories. Thank you. 

All my love,

‚ÄîJ.

The substitute manager is not here anymore, but I was talking to one of my coworkers yesterday and she said that our substitute manager told her, ‚ÄúWhen I got here, everyone told me [my name] was mean, but she‚Äôs not mean, she just doesn‚Äôt talk.‚Äù My coworker didn‚Äôt say this to be rude and I‚Äôm actually friends with her, but it hurt my feelings.

Mom used to tell us stories when we were kids.

The world before women became barren, and men were suddenly capable of reproducing through a genetic mutation.

Women were still *carriers*, however. Legally obligated to birth children.

Men may have reproduced the child, and had full ability to birth them, but it was the woman's sworn duty as an American citizen to uphold 'traditional' values.

Due to falling birth rates, every woman was obligated to become a Mother at 18.

The implant procedure was...uncomfortable. 

If I didn't find a husband, the child would be removed, and I would be deemed an 'unfit' woman.

Carrying a baby was harder than I thought.

Nausea plagued me, my stomach contorting under a growing bulge, turning my face gaunt. I was in a bookstore, trying and failing to reach a book, when a quiet chuckle startled me.

The guy was my age, tall, with sandy blonde hair hanging in his eyes.

‚ÄúDo you need help with that?‚Äù

His eyes found my belly, offering me the book. ‚ÄúOh, shit, man.‚Äù His lips curved. ‚ÄúWhen is she due?‚Äù

‚ÄúAny day now,‚Äù I panted. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

He nodded, his expression twitching with worry. ‚ÄúWell, at least let me help you.‚Äù He eyed the groceries I was struggling to carry. ‚ÄúI'm Jasper.‚Äù

I was too tired to argue.

‚ÄúLily.‚Äù

I let him carry my groceries home.

Jasper was quick to empty all my bags and make me coffee, finally allowing me to relax into my Craigslist couch.

‚ÄúSooo, how far along are you again?‚Äù Jasper asked from the kitchen.

I sipped my coffee, rubbing my belly. ‚ÄúIt's due almost any day now,‚Äù I meant to say, but my tongue was suddenly too big for my mouth, my vision blurring.

I dropped my coffee, my body crumpling.

Warm arms pulled me from the chair, and through half-lidded eyes, Jasper loomed over me, bearing a knife.

‚ÄúI knew I‚Äôd find my daughter,‚Äù he whispered, ice-cold fingers tip toeing across my belly. His wild eyes found mine, lips breaking out into a grin. 

‚ÄúWhen they took her away from me, I felt numb. Like a part of me had been‚Ä¶ ripped out‚ÄîI mean, they did rip her out. They held me down, just like this, sliced me open, and took her.‚Äù

He pinned down my wrists. ‚ÄúI swore I‚Äôd track her down, and be her real fucking dad. I'm going to take care of her,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI'm going to get her a bed, and toys, and maybe she‚Äôll do tricks!‚Äù

The cold steel of the knife sliced into my belly, and I screamed.

He laughed.

Even though we weren‚Äôt married anymore, there was something deep inside me that wanted to be there for him. I knew he was struggling he wasn‚Äôt the same person I remembered. He was lost, unsure of himself, and dealing with a lot of pain that he never voiced directly. But I could see it.

One day, Peter called me. His voice was shaky, and even though he didn‚Äôt come right out and say it, I could tell he needed support. He wasn‚Äôt asking for help, but it was clear he didn‚Äôt know how to navigate everything he was going through. I agreed to meet him at the coffee shop we used to visit together. I wasn‚Äôt sure what I could do, but I knew I couldn‚Äôt turn my back on him.

When I saw him, he was sitting at the window, staring outside like he was trying to find answers in the world. He didn‚Äôt look up when I sat down, but after a few moments, he spoke. He apologized for everything, saying he felt like he‚Äôd failed failed at our marriage, failed at life. It broke my heart to hear him say that. I knew he was struggling with his own sense of worth, and in that moment, I just wanted to remind him that he wasn‚Äôt defined by his mistakes or the end of our relationship.

I told him he wasn‚Äôt alone in this. That he didn‚Äôt have to carry it all by himself. He looked at me like he wasn‚Äôt sure how to believe it, but I meant every word. I told him that even after everything, I still believed in him. That he was more than the pain he was feeling. I wasn‚Äôt trying to fix him I just wanted to help him see that he was still capable of finding his way back, even if it felt impossible right then.

He admitted that he didn‚Äôt know who he was anymore, and I could see the vulnerability in his eyes. He was afraid he couldn‚Äôt come back from everything. And honestly, I understood that feeling. But I also knew he deserved to heal, to feel like he could start again. Peter said he didn‚Äôt feel like he deserved my kindness, and in that moment, I could hear how much he was beating himself up. I told him he did deserve kindness. That no one, including him, should have to go through this alone.

We sat there for a while, just talking, with no pressure and no expectations just two people who once shared a life, now finding a way to support each other in a new way. It wasn‚Äôt about us getting back together or fixing what was broken. It was about showing him that he still mattered, that he wasn‚Äôt beyond redemption or lost forever.

That day, I realized something important: sometimes, supporting someone doesn‚Äôt mean fixing everything or solving their problems. It means showing up, being present, and letting them know they‚Äôre not alone, even when life feels like it‚Äôs falling apart. And that‚Äôs what I tried to do for Peter.

In this conversation I triggered my partner with an insensitive comment and additionally I want to mention that we had both a very bad night of sleep so our level of reactiveness was higher than usual.

Anyways we have a deal that when a sensitive topic comes up we can throw in our ""safe word"" so we both know this is not the right timing, energy and setting for this topic to talk about now. My partner throw in the word and I immediately also recognized that I stepped on her toes. Despite her saying our safe word she kept talking about the same topic as stored anger from the past came up and she couldn't hold back or recognize her trigger right away.

I don't know if you know this situations when you feel that you are kind of discussing with each other but you can feel that this will lead just nowhere and every word will just contribute to further esca√∂ting energy, thats exactly what it was.

I didn't reply to what she was saying as I knew that I would speak from a place of being hurt. We left the coffee went back to the car and we both felt not in a nice energy afterwards, we both felt distance to each other and being hurt.

In the past these where exactly the situations that have been the cause for huge escalations as we never managed to get out of this vicious circle of two hurt children in grown up costumes keep blaming and accusing each other.

What was different this time?

I had place where I could go immediately to understand what was going on inside of me, that helps me to see myself from the outside perspective, that helps to distance myself just a little bid to understand both sides of the coin and that helps to shift my emotional state from being hurt, accusing & blaming into a state of acknowledging and connecting to my pain, understanding my need and therefore being able to respond from a place of compassion and understanding. The Lumii APP helped my like crazy today, yes I might be biased as I am involved in the project, but it is just hard to believe how it worked out today and prevented a lot of unnecessary suffering.  I feel  a lot of gratefulness today for everyone who is contributing to this project, to this subreddit and I am also proud to say that I am part of a project like this. I hope it will help many, many more people tapping into a constructive way of how to deal with difficult emotions in their everyday life. I believe that if we are able to take good small decisions in the everyday life which are true to what we feel, we are really creating a good foundation for a life that we truly want.

After I went through the lumii process I was really able to communicate my need and pain from the heart, I could show understanding for my partners pain and we where able to hug and forgive each other.

I don‚Äôt know what to do next. Help?,"My husband and I have been together for almost 5 years. Up until the fall of 2023, we had no issues with breath. We have always eaten a pretty standard diet. Not necessarily health nuts but a good balance of primarily cooking food at home and occasionally eating out. We moved to a new city in our state in May of 2023, and sometime last fall the breath stuff started. 

At first I thought he just needed to brush. When it was still there we thought maybe he just needs to brush better? That still didn‚Äôt work so he started flossing every day, brushing his tongue and using mouthwash. That still didn‚Äôt touch it. I also noticed that some days it was there and some it wasn‚Äôt.

This might sound odd but I have always had a very strong sense of smell. My mom says I get it from her. I felt like I could smell that the bad breath was not coming from his mouth,  it something deeper back in his throat. We thought maybe tonsil stones, but I know that smell and it‚Äôs not it. He looked for them himself and didn‚Äôt see any and made a dentist appt. They found some beginning stages of some sort of low grade gum disease and did an extensive periodontal cleaning and even gave him a special mouthwash. Every visit since then, they have said he looks fine and great. 

He went to his doctor about it and ended up going to an ENT and a gastroenterologist both said it could be heartburn but they didn‚Äôt give a clear answer. Seemed like he maybe would need to get some sort of imaging or a scan done that was just too expensive and we weren‚Äôt confident it would give answers.

He has tried drinking a baking soda solution, hydrogen peroxide mouthwash, otc antacid and calcium carbonate, and even just taken Tums. He stopped drinking coffee and energy drinks. All of these things may work for a day maybe, but won‚Äôt work the next. And then we don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs actually them working or if it‚Äôs just not happening that day. He did not change his diet prior to this starting to occur. In fact, since this started he has changed his diet multiple times and we have not seen a change in the issue. 

It‚Äôs terrible. I feel so terrible for him especially since he is trying to hard. Our sex life used to be amazing, but I just can‚Äôt when it‚Äôs like this. It‚Äôs not his fault and he has done SO much to try to find the cause and solution to this. But it‚Äôs over a year later and just getting worse. I don‚Äôt know how to describe the smell. It doesn‚Äôt smell like poop, tonsil issues or like he has a cold. It doesn‚Äôt smell like food or coffee breath. I‚Äôm starting to worry I may be smelling something bad that‚Äôs happening to him, like he is sick and for some reason I can smell it. It‚Äôs affecting us both so much and I hate myself for this but it‚Äôs affecting our relationship. I have severe anxiety and experience symptoms of OCD when it comes to hygiene and cleanliness in kitchens/bathrooms specifically. Lately I have found that if I come home and the apartment smells like the bad breath, I get extremely irritable and depressed.

IMO, the gram range on baskets isn't very helpful. So once I've found a dose of coffee that fills my basket just right, I take that dose and find a container that just fits it.

Then when I have a new bean, I use my reference container and get my first dose. Then I measure the weight of the first dose so I can determine my target yield.

The reason for this post is I have been planing to start my own IT consultation business, to get leads I am aware I need to put myself out there and make contacts by networking. The issue is, once I make a contact I totally forget about them and don‚Äôt bother initiating contact or catching up. Note that I do make friends with like minded people and have been in touch with them. But with people who aren‚Äôt like minded, who do want to hangout with me I shy away, I make excuses or just ignore them.

How do you guys do it? How do you  maintain constant connection once you establish a contact, especially if that person could be a potential lead in the future? Do you text them to hangout , WhatsApp them every now and then , call them , hang out for coffee ??  Or simply get in touch only when needed - to me this seems cold and opportunistic. 

Is there a book I can read to become more social or tips to socialize and be in constant contact? ",4,1736608249.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone! Double post - also posted this in the sterilization subreddit. Everyone has been amazing during this journey!

 I wanted to share my experience to help assuage any nervousness others might have about getting surgery. Long post ahead - skip to second paragraph of the story if you don‚Äôt care about background lol!

Background: I have known my whole life I‚Äôve never wanted kids. I have been using a Mirena IUD for several years (over 10 and have gone through two) and have loved the no periods benefit! I knew I wanted to get a salpingectomy at some point but have always been nervous about getting surgery. For full transparency - I am an OBGYN myself so I‚Äôve done these procedures and know of their safety but it‚Äôs always different when you are the patient!! But after this election, I have been extremely nervous about a reduction in birth control coverage and access. One of my friends who I did my residency training lives nearby and her office takes my insurance and she also knew how much I wanted my tubes out. Given that my current medical job has lots of flexibility, it would be fully covered by insurance, and I had a surgeon I trusted - it was a perfect time to get it done.

Preop appointment: I had my preoperative appointment in December. She normally does not do an exam as long as people don‚Äôt have a surgical history - but I will tell you that some physicians will (we did them in training), and they do this not to make people uncomfortable, but rather sometimes they like to feel the size and shape of your uterus before doing surgery, and some people do like to make sure you‚Äôre up-to-date on preventative things like Pap smears and STI screening. Some doctors make you do a pregnancy test or labs at your preop visit as well as before surgery and some don‚Äôt. so it really just depends. I just had a consultation for a formality and then we scheduled surgery. I was initially scheduled for February but she put my on a waitlist to be called if something opened up sooner - which it did and I got my surgery Jan 10. I had planned to keep my IUD for period suppression (and exchange it in a few years just for comfort).

Leading up to surgery: I got a few phone calls in the weeks prior: one was their billing office discussing insurance. Insurance covers the procedure and the OBGYN portion. It doesn‚Äôt always cover the anesthesia or the facility charge - so please know that when scheduling. They said they would come up with an ‚Äúestimate‚Äù but that I would not need to pay anything until I received a bill in the mail with the final totals - and then they stated they would work out a payment plan. After insurance it would most likely be $4,000 (again the facility charge and anesthesia charge). The week of surgery I got two phone calls: one was the facility asking for my general medical history and providing preoperative instructions - in general they want to make sure surgery is safe for you. You are asked to have nothing to eat past midnight the day of surgery and you can have clear liquids up to 3 hours prior to surgery (black coffee counts as clear liquids). They also provided directions to the surgery  center, and discussed that you must have someone to drive you home and be with you for 24 hours after anesthesia. The second call was the day before my surgery making sure I didn‚Äôt have any questions and repeating the preoperative instructions and essentially a ‚Äúpre-registration‚Äù (making sure they had the right insurance, emergency contact info, etc.).

Day of Surgery - Preop: we got to the one day surgery center at 5:30 AM. I wore sweats because I didn‚Äôt want to have to change into something tight after surgery (just wear something comfortable). Check-in was super quick, I just had to give them my name and sign a consent to treat. My partner waited in the lobby while they brought me back to the preoperative area. There, I provided urine for a pregnancy test (standard), I signed my surgical consents with the preoperative nurse, got my vitals checked, and answered normal routine check in questions - just like you do when you go to the doctors office. I was then asked to change into a surgical gown, put on the little socks with the sticky stuff at the bottom to prevent falls, and I had to wipe down my body with some antibacterial wipes. I will know that if you shave the night before the day of surgery, do not wipe these areas with the wipes because it burns a lot. I didn‚Äôt wipe my legs, but I forgot that I had shaved under my arms And it was probably the most uncomfortable thing during the whole day. Lol but alas I survived. They started an IV in my right hand which was a tiny poke and then honestly I forgot it was in there, and they took more blood from my left arm (my blood type and make sure I wasn‚Äôt anemic prior to surgery). They gave me fluids while I waited which was cool because it felt like someone was dripping water on my hand but it was the fluid going in! They had me take off all my jewelry and I put tape on my helix and daith piercings on my ears because I didn‚Äôt know how to take them out - this is to prevent surgical burns if they have to use any type of electrical current and metal on your skin can burn you. They also gave me a lunch lady hairnet which I waited to put on. They gave me some preop pain meds and brought my partner back to sit with me and we just sat and chatted for about an hour. I met with the anesthesiologist who asked me standards questions and then my surgeon came in to make sure all the paperwork was ready and make sure all my questions were answered. You also get warm blankets during this time which was a nice touch :) once we were ready to roll I kissed my partner goodbye who took my bag winter coat and purse with my glasses (I am very blind). My clothing and shoes were placed in a bag and given to the preop nurse who locked them away. I walked holding my IV back and covered in the back by a blanket with the nurse so I wouldn‚Äôt moon the whole unit! They gave my partner my ‚Äúcase code‚Äù so he could watch on the screen in the waiting room where I was (in procedure, procedure done, recovery 1, recovery 2) which was nice.

Surgery: once I walked into the OR it was FREEZING. They keep it cold so that the surgeons don‚Äôt pass out while doing surgery because it gets HOT under the surgical gowns and lights. They had me lay on the surgical bed and immediately covered me with warm blankets. They played some fun music while they put a bunch of monitors on me and made sure I was in good position. They put an O2 mask on me and gave me a benzodiazepine for anxiety and said ‚Äúpick out a good dream.‚Äù My surgeon held my hand while I getting the medicine (it burned a bit but not bad at all) That is all I remember. 

PACU (post anesthesia care unit): the next thing I remember I was waking up to a friendly man in recovery. He said surgery went great and that I apparently kept ‚Äúthanking‚Äù everyone. I honestly started crying partially from drugs but also just from the great relief I felt after surgery!! He just checked my vitals and took off excess stickers while I woke up. I was there for about an hour. Once I seemed awake enough he walked me to the bathroom to make sure I could ambulate and pee. Then I moved to phase 2 of recovery. There was a little recliner and they brought my partner back to be with me in phase 2. They brought me some crackers and ginger ale to make sure I wasn‚Äôt nauseous and that my pain was okay. Then nurse went over all my preop instructions in A LOT of detail which was great (again even though I‚Äôm a surgeon it‚Äôs nice to have these read out to me). He told me where my prescriptions were sent (prescription strength Tylenol and ibuprofen and then a few tablets of oxycodone if I needed it). They also gave me pictures of the inside of my body (I personally requested these because I was curious and it was SO cool). Then, I got dressed and because I was doing so good they just walked me out to my car but they did offer a wheelchair. My parent drove me home.

Timeline of the day: 
5:30: Arrive to preop
7:30: Walk back to the OR
8:30: Wake up in recovery 
9:45: Start my drive home

I was probably under anesthesia for a total of 30 min.

Home recovery: so far so good! Postop day 0 I was pretty sore - primarily from the gas they have to put in your abdomen to inflate it to see everything but it honestly just feels like I did a very intense ab workout and mostly hurts when I go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I mostly ate small spoonfuls of ice cream and drank Gatorade and just spent the day on the couch. My partner worked from home next to me! My first full meal was dinner and they recommend something light (sometimes people get nauseous after surgery). I took Tylenol and ibuprofen around the clock. I took half a tablet of the oxycodone before bed just to help me sleep but honestly I don‚Äôt think I need it. The best thing has been using a heating pad on my belly for the cramping and we got some small pads because I have some spotting. It still burns when I urinate but it‚Äôs been getting better. Postop day 1 and my throat is really sore (which they warned me) so I got some throat lozenges and drank some tea. Honestly I feel pretty good just very very sore. I have the weekend to recover and I work from home Monday during the day and then I‚Äôm on call that night and I think I should be good to go! Haven‚Äôt had a bowel movement yet but they warned me I could get constipated so I‚Äôve been taking stool softeners. My partner has been so supportive and kind :)

Summary: all in all, it was an amazing experience.  I trusted my surgical team and so far I‚Äôm doing great. Wishing everyone the best and if you all have any questions please don‚Äôt hesitate to ask. I‚Äôm so excited to start this chapter of my life with one less thing to worry about and live my life my way. I have three super small incisions (one on my belly and two on the right).

I have no idea if the translation is right I‚Äôll have to depend on you all


In the hush of dawn, when the world is still,  
Two hearts resonate, a bond they fulfill.  
Across the vast ocean, where waters divide,  
Friendship transcends, like the tide‚Äôs gentle slide.  

With whispers of laughter that dance on the breeze,  
From shores far apart, they share memories with ease.  
Though miles may extend like the horizon's embrace,  
In the warmth of their words, they find a sweet place.  

The sun sets in gold on one side of the sea,  
While the moon rises bright for the other to see.  
Yet in the twilight's glow, their spirits align,  
In the tapestry woven, their stories entwine.  

Through seasons of life, they weather the storm,  
In letters and calls, their affection transforms.  
A shared cup of coffee, a virtual toast,  
In the realm of the heart, they cherish the most.  

Time zones may shift, and the years may roll on,  
Yet friendships like theirs are never withdrawn.  
For kindness is timeless, and laughter is free,  
In the dance of connection, they‚Äôre always in spree.  

So here's to the friends, both near and afar,  
Who light up our lives like the brightest of stars.  
Across the great ocean, may their spirits forever,  
Bridge every distance, uniting us ever.

Amis √† Travers l'Oc√©an

Dans le silence de l‚Äôaube, quand le monde est encore,  
Deux c≈ìurs r√©sonnent, un lien qu‚Äôils d√©corent.  
√Ä travers l‚Äôimmense oc√©an, l√† o√π les eaux se s√©parent,  
L‚Äôamiti√© transcende, comme la douce mar√©e qui s‚Äô√©gare.  

Avec des rires chuchot√©s qui dansent dans la brise,  
De rives √©loign√©es, ils partagent des souvenirs avec aisance.  
Bien que les kilom√®tres s‚Äô√©tendent comme l‚Äô√©treinte de l‚Äôhorizon,  
Dans la chaleur de leurs mots, ils trouvent une douce raison.  

Le soleil se couche en or d‚Äôun c√¥t√© de la mer,  
Tandis que la lune se l√®ve, brillante, pour l‚Äôautre √† d√©couvrir.  
Pourtant, dans l‚Äô√©clat du cr√©puscule, leurs esprits s‚Äôalignent,  
Dans la tapisserie tiss√©e, leurs histoires s‚Äôentrelacent et s‚Äôassignent.  

√Ä travers les saisons de la vie, ils affrontent la temp√™te,  
Dans des lettres et des appels, leur affection se projette.  
Une tasse de caf√© partag√©e, un toast virtuel,  
Dans le royaume du c≈ìur, ils ch√©rissent le plus essentiel.  

Les fuseaux horaires changent, et les ann√©es d√©filent,  
Pourtant, des amiti√©s comme la leur ne se retirent jamais, avec une grande habile.  
Car la bont√© est intemporelle, et le rire est libre,  
Dans la danse de la connexion, ils sont toujours en f√™te.  

Alors levons nos verres aux amis, proches et lointains,  
Qui illuminent nos vies comme les √©toiles aux destins.  
√Ä travers le grand oc√©an, que leurs esprits √† jamais,  
Rendent chaque distance plus proche, unissant √† jamais.

I kindly explained how the site worked. we continued chatting for a couple of weeks. it was very friendly, and I didn't think much about it. he was the one doing the contact. I just responded when I had time. we seemed to hit it off. he was smart. seemed educated and his photo showed quite an elegant person. he claimed to work for DOD on classified projects. RED FLAG #1 

we ended up communicating on signal. had several phone calls his accent fitted his claim to be from a Scandinavian country. after a few weeks I suggested we meet for coffee. we lived an hour drive from each other, so I'd been led to believe. but he said he needed to travel to another state to set up a project, classified of course.  things were going well and then he claimed to love me!!! BIG RED FLAG GOES UP! he became very emotionally direct. miss you. can't wait to spend my life with you. we even planned the house we would buy.

I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop: needs money for airfare to visit sick child or to escape some awful situation. but it never happened. he had said he was divorced. as things progressed and I couldn't see that shoe I was expecting to drop.  I started thinking maybe I'd met the man of my dreams. 

he attempted a video call that lasted all but a fraction of a second as he dropped his phone. ( which I discovered later to be a ploy of scammers) throughout I was considerate, friendly, kind and concerned for him. this is now two months into the contact. I started considering him a friend. I wasn't interested in being coupled but if it happens great. it seemed fine to have a supported kind text friend, then he was contracted to go to middle east (ME) to set up a project. I thought this was strange as the war is going on. RED FLAG #3.

he arrives in said ME country and within a few days calls to tell me he's having trouble getting into his bank to transfer monies to pay for equipment. he's trying to figure what to do. I suggest obvious: call the company who sent you. he can't do that. instead after a day or two he asks if I can help him?? can I see if I can access the website for his bank and see if I can figure why he can't. I know stupid of me I had 3 red flags. but he seemed a wonderful caring man. LOL this is RD FLAG #4

 I went to website while he was on phone with me. I chatted with customer service, who I believe was him, and asked why he couldn't get into his account. they don't do business in ME! even though they are an offshore bank. he seemed concerned and said, ""let me think about what else he can do. if he can't come up with something i'll give you (me) my log info and maybe you can transfer for me""!! BIG BIG RED FLAG #5

fortunately, his hanging up to think what to do, gave me time to investigate. I discovered STARLINK, who he claimed to be contracted to, did not get gov agreement to operate in this ME country. also the banking institution he was trying to access was considered fraudulent, is not registered with the SEC and was only set up two months ago. coincidence! I take a deep breath and contact FBI giving them the info I had. lost count of RED FLAGS by now.

I lay in bed disappointed about what could have been. pulled myself out of the dream and realized how lucky I was to be aware and suspicious from the start and very, very fortunate that I won't lose my money...just the love of my life..lol

the scammers get you to lock into their banking making it seem that it's safe after all it's not my bank or my money but what you don't realize is the website they create has other entities that swoop in and take your info and get access to your banking!! I never understood how people could lose all their money without sending or writing a cheque. now I know.

I'm writing this as a warning in the hope it prevents someone from being taken advantage of. don't do anything for anyone you don't really know.

I text the guy to say, I didn't feel comfortable doing the transaction. I did it in a nonconfrontational way so as to not upset him. but he seemed annoyed and the more he talked his accent changed. not sure if it was the same person or they work in a group.

oh, the camera. I asked several times for him to send me pics if his locations. I wanted evidence. he said: ""don't you remember babe I dropped my phone and it damaged the camera?"" lol 

you may wonder why I continued texting with him for so long, I had just ended a relationship, and I guess the scammer was a distraction, he was smooth, knew all the right things to say and as I said intelligent and handsome. how could someone like this be using me??  also as it was slow progressing, I was confused as to whether he was playing with me. and his supposed job made sense as to why we couldn't meet. I kept my wits about me and didn't fall for his nonsense. 

I hope I help someone. be vigilant check out institution there are sights to check for you, scamadvisor is one. SEC, there are many, also, don't be afraid to contact FBI they will advise. and check with your own bank. if someone cares about you they will never ask you to do something illegal. you can be done for money laundering if you actually transfer money are caught.

I only took it on an empty stomach (only coffee and water) and i ate after 3 hours or something, but i think i have taken it again on an empty stomach this period and didnt have this effect

Keeping your home and kitchen spaces organized can seem overwhelming, but with a bit of creativity, you can transform these areas into functional and beautiful environments. Here are some innovative ideas to help you reclaim your space, enhance efficiency, and make everything more accessible.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen  
  
### Maximize Vertical Space

One of the best strategies you can use in your home and kitchen is to take advantage of vertical space. By utilizing walls, you can free up counter surfaces and create a more open atmosphere.

- **Floating Shelves:** Install floating shelves to display your favorite dishes or cookbooks. This also adds a decorative element.
- **Wall Hooks:** Use hooks to hang pots, pans, and utensils. This not only keeps them visible but also adds an artistic flair to your kitchen.
- **Over-the-Door Racks:** Maximize the backside of doors in your pantry or bathroom with racks for spices, dish towels, or cleaning supplies.

### Creative Storage Solutions

Every corner of your home has the potential for storage. When looking for creative organization ideas, think outside the box.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen  
  
- **Under-Bed Storage:** Utilize under-bed storage bins for seasonal clothing or extra kitchen linens. This keeps your bedroom tidy while providing extra space.
- **Multi-Functional Furniture:** Invest in furniture pieces such as ottomans with hidden compartments or coffee tables that double as storage units. This is perfect for both functionality and aesthetics.
- **Magnetic Strips:** Attach a magnetic strip to the wall for tools or spice jars. This keeps items easily accessible while saving drawer space.

### Declutter with Decluttering Routines

Sometimes, less is more. Start by identifying items that you no longer use or need in your home and kitchen. A regular decluttering routine can keep your spaces organized.

- **Monthly Check-Ins:** Set aside time each month to evaluate the items in your kitchen and living areas. Ask yourself if each item serves a purpose.
- **Donation Boxes:** Keep a donation box in your home. Whenever you find something you no longer need, drop it in the box and take it to a local charity.
- **One In, One Out Rule:** For every new item you bring into your home, consider removing an old one. This can help maintain balance.

### Kitchen Drawer Dividers

Kitchen drawers can quickly become a catch-all for utensils, gadgets, and miscellaneous items. Implement drawer dividers for clear organization.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen  
  
- **Custom Dividers:** Use adjustable dividers to create sections for different kitchen tools, making it easy to find what you need.
- **Drawer Organizers:** Invest in organizers for cutlery or spices that fit your specific drawers for a clean, orderly look.

### Labeling Can Make a Difference

Labeling is one of the simplest yet most effective organization strategies. When everything has a designated spot, it's easier to keep areas tidy.

- **Clear Containers:** Use labeled clear containers to store pantry items like pasta, grains, and snacks. This not only helps with visibility but also keeps items fresh.
- **Baskets:** Label baskets for different kitchen items such as snacks, baking supplies, or breakfast items to make accessing your favorites a breeze.

### Color Coding

Color coding is a fun way to organize your home and kitchen spaces while making them visually appealing.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen  
  
- **Kitchen Tools:** Use color-coded utensils or dishware to make your cooking routine easier. It‚Äôs not only practical, but it adds a cheerful touch.
- **Files and Papers:** Organize important documents by color in your home office or kitchen area. This will make finding crucial papers much simpler.

Implementing these creative organization ideas can significantly improve your home and kitchen spaces. Remember, a clutter-free environment not only enhances the look of your home but also promotes productivity and peace of mind.

Added this mini ek43 (Urbanic 080) to deal with the espresso side of things. I had a long break from espresso but the fly bit me again. Pietro with pro brew burrs can't really go fine enough and is too uniform in my opinion, but that's allright. It absolutely kicks ass with pour over..

Also after 4 sink shots you start guestioning your hobby choices with the manual grinder only.

Cool looks aside, I much preferred how the Mignon Specialita works and sounds, compared to the Korean thing. Don't buy this one if you don't especially value its aesthetics. The coffee is really good, but it's relatively difficult to get out of that thing even with a bellow hopper.. Mixed feelings so far because it wasn't exactly cheap anymore with the VAT and shipping, but at least it looks really nice lol.

1hyxmo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Final_Canary5374/comments/1hyxmo4/the_haunted_doll_is_this_haunted_doll_the/,The Haunted Doll | Is This Haunted Doll the SCARIEST Toy EVER Made?I,"I never considered myself a superstitious person. Ghost stories, haunted houses, cursed objects ‚Äî they were all just tales to entertain us around campfires or on stormy nights. But I learned, the hard way, that some things are far more terrifying than any story could ever capture.

It started with a box. A plain, unmarked package left on my doorstep one cold November morning. There was no return address, no note, just a neatly wrapped parcel with my name scrawled across it in an elegant but unfamiliar handwriting. At first, I assumed it was a mistake, a package meant for someone else. But curiosity has a way of overriding reason, so I brought it inside, set it on my kitchen table, and peeled back the paper.

Inside was a doll.

Not the cheerful kind you‚Äôd see in toy stores or a child‚Äôs bedroom. No, this was something entirely different. Its porcelain face was cracked, as though it had been dropped and hastily repaired. Its eyes ‚Äî glassy, unblinking ‚Äî were a vivid, unnatural blue that seemed to follow me no matter where I moved. The doll wore a faded Victorian-style dress, tattered at the hem, and clutched a small, threadbare teddy bear in its tiny hands. There was something off about it, something I couldn‚Äôt quite place but felt deep in my bones.

I should have thrown it away then and there. But instead, I set it on a shelf in my living room, thinking nothing more of it.

That night, I awoke to the sound of footsteps.

At first, I thought it was the creaking of the old wooden floors in my house. It was an old place, full of quirks and noises that I‚Äôd grown used to over the years. But these weren‚Äôt the random creaks of settling wood. They were deliberate, rhythmic, moving closer and closer to my bedroom.

I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. Someone was in my house.

I reached for my phone on the nightstand, my fingers trembling as I dialed 911. But before I could hit the call button, the footsteps stopped. Dead silence filled the house. I strained my ears, waiting for any sign of movement, but there was nothing. After what felt like an eternity, I summoned the courage to get out of bed and check the locks. Everything was secure. No sign of a break-in.

I didn‚Äôt sleep much that night.

The next morning, I noticed something strange. The doll wasn‚Äôt on the shelf where I‚Äôd left it. Instead, it was sitting on my coffee table, its unblinking eyes staring directly at me. A chill ran down my spine. I tried to convince myself that I must have moved it and forgotten, but deep down, I knew better. Still, I placed it back on the shelf and went about my day, trying to shake off the unease that clung to me like a second skin.

But the footsteps returned that night. Louder this time, accompanied by faint whispers that I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. I stayed in bed, clutching the covers like a lifeline, my mind racing with every worst-case scenario. And then, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped. The house fell silent once more.

When I ventured into the living room the next morning, the doll was on the floor, its head turned to face the doorway as though it had been waiting for me. My stomach churned, a sickening wave of dread washing over me. This wasn‚Äôt 

I decided to get rid of it.

I threw the doll into a box, taped it shut, and drove to the nearest thrift store. The clerk gave me a strange look as I handed it over, but I didn‚Äôt care. I just wanted it gone. For the first time in days, I felt a sense of relief, as though a weight had been lifted from my shoulders.

That night, I slept peacefully. No footsteps. No whispers. Just silence.

But the peace didn‚Äôt last.

The next morning, the doll was back. Sitting on my kitchen table, its glassy eyes fixed on mine. My breath caught in my throat, and I stumbled backward, nearly knocking over a chair. This couldn‚Äôt be happening. It wasn‚Äôt possible.

I grabbed the doll and drove to the edge of town, where an old quarry had been turned into a landfill. I hurled the doll as far as I could, watching as it disappeared into the sea of trash below. This time, I was sure it was gone for good.

Or so I thought.

When I returned home, the doll was waiting for me on the front porch.

The doll had crossed a line now. It wasn‚Äôt just an eerie object; it was something far worse, something malevolent. I stared at it, my hands trembling as I unlocked the front door. I thought about leaving it out there, abandoning the house altogether, but where would I go? This was my home.

I picked it up with shaking hands and brought it inside, though every fiber of my being screamed not to. I needed to understand what I was dealing with. There had to be a logical explanation. Or so I told myself.

I set the doll on the table and examined it closely. The cracks in its porcelain face seemed deeper, darker, almost like veins spreading beneath its surface. Its dress looked more tattered than before, and the teddy bear in its hands was now missing an eye. But the most unsettling change was its eyes. They weren‚Äôt just unblinking anymore. They were alive, shimmering faintly in the dim light, as though something was looking out from within.

I decided to research the doll‚Äôs origin. It had to come from somewhere, right? I took photos of it and uploaded them to a few online forums dedicated to antique dolls and paranormal oddities. Within hours, the responses started pouring in. Most were generic, guesses about its age or style. But one message stood out.

It came from a user with no profile picture and a username that was just a random string of numbers. The message read: ""Get rid of it. Burn it if you can. Do not keep it in your home. It‚Äôs not just a doll.""

My stomach churned as I read the words. I replied, asking what they meant, but the user never responded. The message haunted me all day, a seed of fear that grew with every passing hour.

That night, the whispers returned, louder and more distinct. I couldn‚Äôt understand the words, but they were undeniably there, circling through the house like a malevolent wind. And then came the laughter ‚Äî soft, childlike, but twisted in a way that made my skin crawl. It was coming from the living room.

I grabbed a flashlight and crept down the hallway, my heart pounding so loudly I thought it might burst. The light flickered as I entered the room, casting eerie shadows on the walls. The doll was no longer on the table. It was sitting in my armchair, its head tilted slightly, as if it were smiling at me.

My breath caught, and I dropped the flashlight. The room plunged into darkness, and the whispers grew louder, more insistent. I stumbled backward, fumbling for the light switch, but when I finally turned it on, the doll was gone.

The room was empty.

I searched the entire house, every closet, every corner, but it had vanished. Yet I could still feel its presence, like a weight pressing down on me, suffocating and inescapable. I locked myself in my bedroom and stayed awake until dawn, clutching a knife for protection.

The next morning, I found the doll in my bed.

I was unraveling. My mind felt like it was fraying at the edges, each thread pulled loose by the presence of that cursed doll. Every logical thought I clung to had been shredded by the impossible. It wasn‚Äôt just my sanity at stake anymore; it felt like my very soul was under siege.

The doll wasn‚Äôt inanimate. It wasn‚Äôt just a creepy relic with a mysterious origin. It was alive in some way I couldn‚Äôt comprehend, and worse, it wanted something from me.

I spent the morning scouring the internet for anything that might help. Stories of haunted dolls weren‚Äôt exactly in short supply, but most were urban legends or thinly veiled horror fiction. None of them offered solutions, just warnings to stay away. But I couldn‚Äôt stay away; it was too late for that. The doll had already chosen me.

One post caught my eye. It was buried deep in a forum for occult enthusiasts. The user claimed to have encountered a similar doll, one that seemed to move on its own and torment its owner. They mentioned a ritual, a way to banish whatever entity was tied to the object. It was risky, they said, and not guaranteed to work, but it was the only lead I had.

The ritual required salt, candles, and something that bound me to the doll ‚Äî in this case, the box it had arrived in. I would need to surround the doll with a circle of salt, light the candles at each cardinal point, and chant a specific incantation while focusing all my intent on severing the connection between me and the entity.

It sounded absurd. But absurdity had become my reality.

That night, I prepared for the ritual. I placed the doll in the center of my living room, surrounded it with a thick ring of salt, and positioned the candles as instructed. The doll‚Äôs eyes seemed to gleam in the flickering candlelight, as though it knew what I was attempting. I took a deep breath, clutching the box it had arrived in, and began to chant.

At first, nothing happened. The room was eerily silent, the only sound my own shaky voice repeating the incantation. But then the air grew heavy, thick with a presence that made my skin crawl. The flames of the candles flickered violently, casting distorted shadows on the walls. The whispers returned, louder than ever, overlapping and chaotic, filling my head with an unbearable cacophony.

And then, the doll moved.

Its head turned slowly, deliberately, until it was facing me. My voice faltered, the chant dying in my throat as I stared in horror. The whispers coalesced into a single voice ‚Äî deep, guttural, and inhuman. ""You cannot escape me,"" it said. ""You invited me in.""

The candles extinguished all at once, plunging the room into darkness. I scrambled backward, clutching the box like a shield. The air was electric, charged with a malevolence that made it hard to breathe. I fumbled for the flashlight I‚Äôd left on the floor, my fingers trembling so badly I could barely hold it. When I finally managed to switch it on, the doll was gone.

But I wasn‚Äôt alone.

The shadows in the room seemed to shift, coalescing into a form that was both amorphous and distinctly humanoid. It towered over me, its presence oppressive and overwhelming. The voice came again, this time from everywhere and nowhere. ""You belong to me now.""

Reality itself seemed to ripple, the edges of the room dissolving into darkness. I tried to move, to scream, but my body refused to obey. The entity loomed closer, and for the first time, I saw its face ‚Äî or rather, the absence of one. It was a void, a swirling chasm of nothingness that pulled at my very essence.

The doll appeared at its feet, its glassy eyes now glowing with a malevolent light. The entity reached out, its shadowy hand closing around me, and the world shattered.

I woke up to the sound of a doorbell.

Disoriented, I stumbled to the front door and found a plain, unmarked package waiting for me. My name was scrawled across it in elegant, unfamiliar handwriting.

1hyxmep,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1hyxmep/bilateral_salpingectomy_success/,Bilateral Salpingectomy - Success!,"Hi everyone! Everyone in this community and the childfree subreddit have just been so supportive and kind. I wanted to share my experience to help assuage any nervousness others might have about getting surgery. Long post ahead - skip to second paragraph of the story if you don‚Äôt care about background lol!

Background: I have known my whole life I‚Äôve never wanted kids. I have been using a Mirena IUD for several years (over 10 and have gone through two) and have loved the no periods benefit! I knew I wanted to get a salpingectomy at some point but have always been nervous about getting surgery. For full transparency - I am an OBGYN myself so I‚Äôve done these procedures and know of their safety but it‚Äôs always different when you are the patient!! But after this election, I have been extremely nervous about a reduction in birth control coverage and access. One of my friends who I did my residency training lives nearby and her office takes my insurance and she also knew how much I wanted my tubes out. Given that my current medical job has lots of flexibility, it would be fully covered by insurance, and I had a surgeon I trusted - it was a perfect time to get it done.

Preop appointment: I had my preoperative appointment in December. She normally does not do an exam as long as people don‚Äôt have a surgical history - but I will tell you that some physicians will (we did them in training), and they do this not to make people uncomfortable, but rather sometimes they like to feel the size and shape of your uterus before doing surgery, and some people do like to make sure you‚Äôre up-to-date on preventative things like Pap smears and STI screening. Some doctors make you do a pregnancy test or labs at your preop visit as well as before surgery and some don‚Äôt. so it really just depends. I just had a consultation for a formality and then we scheduled surgery. I was initially scheduled for February but she put my on a waitlist to be called if something opened up sooner - which it did and I got my surgery Jan 10. I had planned to keep my IUD for period suppression (and exchange it in a few years just for comfort).

Leading up to surgery: I got a few phone calls in the weeks prior: one was their billing office discussing insurance. Insurance covers the procedure and the OBGYN portion. It doesn‚Äôt always cover the anesthesia or the facility charge - so please know that when scheduling. They said they would come up with an ‚Äúestimate‚Äù but that I would not need to pay anything until I received a bill in the mail with the final totals - and then they stated they would work out a payment plan. After insurance it would most likely be $4,000 (again the facility charge and anesthesia charge). The week of surgery I got two phone calls: one was the facility asking for my general medical history and providing preoperative instructions - in general they want to make sure surgery is safe for you. You are asked to have nothing to eat past midnight the day of surgery and you can have clear liquids up to 3 hours prior to surgery (black coffee counts as clear liquids). They also provided directions to the surgery  center, and discussed that you must have someone to drive you home and be with you for 24 hours after anesthesia. The second call was the day before my surgery making sure I didn‚Äôt have any questions and repeating the preoperative instructions and essentially a ‚Äúpre-registration‚Äù (making sure they had the right insurance, emergency contact info, etc.).

Day of Surgery - Preop: we got to the one day surgery center at 5:30 AM. I wore sweats because I didn‚Äôt want to have to change into something tight after surgery (just wear something comfortable). Check-in was super quick, I just had to give them my name and sign a consent to treat. My partner waited in the lobby while they brought me back to the preoperative area. There, I provided urine for a pregnancy test (standard), I signed my surgical consents with the preoperative nurse, got my vitals checked, and answered normal routine check in questions - just like you do when you go to the doctors office. I was then asked to change into a surgical gown, put on the little socks with the sticky stuff at the bottom to prevent falls, and I had to wipe down my body with some antibacterial wipes. I will know that if you shave the night before the day of surgery, do not wipe these areas with the wipes because it burns a lot. I didn‚Äôt wipe my legs, but I forgot that I had shaved under my arms And it was probably the most uncomfortable thing during the whole day. Lol but alas I survived. They started an IV in my right hand which was a tiny poke and then honestly I forgot it was in there, and they took more blood from my left arm (my blood type and make sure I wasn‚Äôt anemic prior to surgery). They gave me fluids while I waited which was cool because it felt like someone was dripping water on my hand but it was the fluid going in! They had me take off all my jewelry and I put tape on my helix and daith piercings on my ears because I didn‚Äôt know how to take them out - this is to prevent surgical burns if they have to use any type of electrical current and metal on your skin can burn you. They also gave me a lunch lady hairnet which I waited to put on. They gave me some preop pain meds and brought my partner back to sit with me and we just sat and chatted for about an hour. I met with the anesthesiologist who asked me standards questions and then my surgeon came in to make sure all the paperwork was ready and make sure all my questions were answered. You also get warm blankets during this time which was a nice touch :) once we were ready to roll I kissed my partner goodbye who took my bag winter coat and purse with my glasses (I am very blind). My clothing and shoes were placed in a bag and given to the preop nurse who locked them away. I walked holding my IV back and covered in the back by a blanket with the nurse so I wouldn‚Äôt moon the whole unit! They gave my partner my ‚Äúcase code‚Äù so he could watch on the screen in the waiting room where I was (in procedure, procedure done, recovery 1, recovery 2) which was nice.

Surgery: once I walked into the OR it was FREEZING. They keep it cold so that the surgeons don‚Äôt pass out while doing surgery because it gets HOT under the surgical gowns and lights. They had me lay on the surgical bed and immediately covered me with warm blankets. They played some fun music while they put a bunch of monitors on me and made sure I was in good position. They put an O2 mask on me and gave me a benzodiazepine for anxiety and said ‚Äúpick out a good dream.‚Äù My surgeon held my hand while I getting the medicine (it burned a bit but not bad at all) That is all I remember. 

PACU (post anesthesia care unit): the next thing I remember I was waking up to a friendly man in recovery. He said surgery went great and that I apparently kept ‚Äúthanking‚Äù everyone. I honestly started crying partially from drugs but also just from the great relief I felt after surgery!! He just checked my vitals and took off excess stickers while I woke up. I was there for about an hour. Once I seemed awake enough he walked me to the bathroom to make sure I could ambulate and pee. Then I moved to phase 2 of recovery. There was a little recliner and they brought my partner back to be with me in phase 2. They brought me some crackers and ginger ale to make sure I wasn‚Äôt nauseous and that my pain was okay. Then nurse went over all my preop instructions in A LOT of detail which was great (again even though I‚Äôm a surgeon it‚Äôs nice to have these read out to me). He told me where my prescriptions were sent (prescription strength Tylenol and ibuprofen and then a few tablets of oxycodone if I needed it). They also gave me pictures of the inside of my body (I personally requested these because I was curious and it was SO cool). Then, I got dressed and because I was doing so good they just walked me out to my car but they did offer a wheelchair. My parent drove me home.

Timeline of the day: 
5:30: Arrive to preop
7:30: Walk back to the OR
8:30: Wake up in recovery 
9:45: Start my drive home

I was probably under anesthesia for a total of 30 min.

Home recovery: so far so good! Postop day 0 I was pretty sore - primarily from the gas they have to put in your abdomen to inflate it to see everything but it honestly just feels like I did a very intense ab workout and mostly hurts when I go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I mostly ate small spoonfuls of ice cream and drank Gatorade and just spent the day on the couch. My partner worked from home next to me! My first full meal was dinner and they recommend something light (sometimes people get nauseous after surgery). I took Tylenol and ibuprofen around the clock. I took half a tablet of the oxycodone before bed just to help me sleep but honestly I don‚Äôt think I need it. The best thing has been using a heating pad on my belly for the cramping and we got some small pads because I have some spotting. It still burns when I urinate but it‚Äôs been getting better. Postop day 1 and my throat is really sore (which they warned me) so I got some throat lozenges and drank some tea. Honestly I feel pretty good just very very sore. I have the weekend to recover and I work from home Monday during the day and then I‚Äôm on call that night and I think I should be good to go! Haven‚Äôt had a bowel movement yet but they warned me I could get constipated so I‚Äôve been taking stool softeners. My partner has been so supportive and kind :)

Summary: all in all, it was an amazing experience.  I trusted my surgical team and so far I‚Äôm doing great. Wishing everyone the best and if you all have any questions please don‚Äôt hesitate to ask. I‚Äôm so excited to start this chapter of my life with one less thing to worry about and live my life my way. I have three small incisions (one on my belly button and two on the right).

1hyxkaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hyxkaa/returned_protector_ch_25/,Returned Protector ch 25,"Officer Cuthbert hadn‚Äôt had a good day. It had started out well enough, heading to the station to meet with his partner and hop in the patrol cruiser. The first sign of things going wrong was when the supervisor had assigned them to foot patrol in Orlando International Airport. Foot patrols were always annoying, people constantly bothered you about minor things that really didn‚Äôt need police attention. Some lady complaining her drink was too cold, or claiming the price of airport food was somehow illegal.

It wasn‚Äôt all bad, of course, plenty of kids would rush up and excitedly ask them about all kinds of things, giving the two of them the chance to play the cool police officers for a bit. Oddly it had gotten better over the last couple years, since the portal things started appearing people were more accepting of having armed officers walking around in public, overshadowing the previous scandals that had dominated the news. But while the public was more welcoming in general, new policies were worrying. Officers were always to patrol in pairs, and when patrolling critical areas like airports they were required to bring their patrol rifles. In theory they also had to have the special ‚Äòanti-creature‚Äô rounds loaded, but after two years only a few made it to individual police stations. Most, apparently, were being sent to the national guard and military.

As such, when the power shut off and creatures started appearing he was glad to have carried his rifle and magazine of AC rounds for the last few hours.

Unfortunately one magazine was all he had, and it was barely enough to take down one of the strange creatures that emerged from a swirling ball of light. Cuthbert and his partner had been in one of the disconnected wings of the airport, and the creatures appeared right in the walkway leading back to the main terminal. They, along with a couple airport security who‚Äôd also been armed, had been forced to retreat into a corner of the gates along with several hundred people.

The AC rounds were a disappointment, barely seeming to harm the first creature to appear, but after seeing what normal rounds did he found himself wishing he had more AC bullets.

And, of course, he was in the one place where even the masses of Florida men behind him weren‚Äôt armed. Meaning it was down to him, his partner, and the two surviving airport security. They‚Äôd managed to push back the two initial creatures, though not before his partner was injured and several civilians were killed. Any thought of trying to make it to the tramline leading to the main terminal was quashed by the grisly sounds echoing through the halls. From fading screams to a wet tearing and crunching that he was trying really hard to not imagine the source of, they weren‚Äôt escaping that way. And going out onto the taxiway wasn‚Äôt any better, packs of the creatures appearing from swirling masses of light and wandering between the wrecks of aircraft they‚Äôd torn though.

All he could do was hide, women struggled to keep their kids silent while men grabbed anything they could that might be useful as a weapon. His partner was struggling to clear a jam in his sidearm without making any noise when everyone heard the clicking of a creature‚Äôs claws on the tiled floor.

Peering out from behind the overturned table, Cuthbert saw one of the creatures prowling in their direction, pausing to sniff and mess with each store it passed. The head, rear legs and body of the monster was cat like, if a cat was the size of a small car, massive eyes with vertical pupils scanned the area with a bestial intelligence while large triangular ears swiveled back and forth. The creature‚Äôs front legs most remind him of a sloth, overly long with massive fixed claws that he‚Äôd seen tear apart metal. While everything else was covered in a thin layer of whitish fur, the creature‚Äôs tail transitioned to large overlapping scales of a slightly darker color. Towards the tip of the tail the scales bunched up, sticking more outward than laying flush with the tail. More than once he‚Äôd seen the creatures snap their tails forward, launching a handful of those scales like clusters of thrown knives.

Looking across the hall at his partner, they made eye contact as the monster slowly came closer to where they hid, it was only a matter of time until they were found. They had to fight, but any gunfire would assuredly bring more of those creatures running. The only other choice was for one person to stand and distract the creature, he could see his partner pleading for him to take that role, but he was hoping his partner would do so. His partner nodded to his injured leg as if to argue that he wouldn‚Äôt be able to lead the creature far. He replied by glancing at the creature, expressing disbelief that anyone could outrun that thing for long.

A deep growl broke their silent argument, it was too late, they‚Äôd been found. Peeking out the creature was growling as it approached the gates where so many people were hiding. Gritting his teeth and saying a prayer, Cuthbert leaned out from cover, leveled his rifle on the creature and began firing. His partner and the airport security quickly followed suit, but they could have been throwing rocks for all the effect the weapons had. Still it gave the creature pause as it shook off the annoying pinpricks, a couple spots of red appearing in its white coat, not nearly enough to kill.

By the time the last of his ammo was gone the thing seemed more confused and angry than hurt, wondering what had been striking it.

This was it, he figured, I did my best but these things just wouldn‚Äôt die. No matter what he did, he was dead. He thought he‚Äôd be afraid, but after over two hours of hiding he was out of fear, all that remained was acceptance. He‚Äôd always laughed at stories of men who chose to die fighting against impossible odds, if you couldn‚Äôt win then why not simply lay down and take it. But now that he found himself in such a situation where death was bearing down on him he found himself feeling differently. He didn‚Äôt want to die laying down, he wanted to be able to claim he did his best, right up until the end. He knew it didn‚Äôt really matter, but perhaps that was the point, if it didn‚Äôt matter if he gave up or fought, then he wanted to go out fighting.

Drawing his baton and taser Cuthbert stood, snapping the baton open with a flick of his wrist. The creature‚Äôs growling got louder as its eyes focused on him. Much to his surprise, Cuthbert felt someone step up along side him, glancing over to see his partner.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Cuthbert said.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù the other man replied, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt think you should die alone.‚Äù

Cuthbert simply smiled, raised his baton and prepared to charge. Sensing his intent the cat-creature coiled up on its haunches, bearing its foot long teeth that were still stained by the blood of the last person it killed.

He started to push off when many things happened all at once, the glass to his right shattered as something shot through it, a wooden pole seemed to sprout from the shoulder of the creature, a man in metal armor appeared out of thin air, grabbed the pole, pulling it free to reveal a foot long blade that had been buried in the flesh of the thing. With cat like reflexes the creature jumped and spun, lashing out with its too long arm and the massive, curved claws cut through the air where the man had been standing. But now, somehow, he was behind the creature and, in a single spin of his spear, cut off the creature‚Äôs tail. Two more lightning fast swipes severed its arms like he was butchering it before a final thrust punctured its skull.

\-\-\-\-\-

Orlan took a breath, pulling his spear free of the beast‚Äôs brain and flicking it clean as he looked over at the two officers.

‚ÄúYou two would make good mages,‚Äù he remarked with a grin, they simply blinked at him, ‚Äúyou need first aid?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, n-no,‚Äù the injured officer replied, ‚Äúplenty of aid kits around.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat, my girls are going to clear the tarmac south of here,‚Äù Orlan continued as dozens of eyes peeked out from their hiding spots, ‚Äúas soon as you see an opening, run for it. If you can make it over the highway you should be safe, national guard has been setting up there. Got it?‚Äù

The officers simply nodded at him, he gave them another grin before turning and running deeper into the airport.

‚ÄúThe creatures resemble Clawed Jungle Lions, but with an artic fur for some reason,‚Äù Nallia‚Äôs voice said in his mind, ‚Äúmost of them are tier two, but we‚Äôve seen several that have broken through into tier three.‚Äù

‚ÄúOdd to see such a familiar beast from a rift,‚Äù Orlan replied, rounding the corner to find a couple more of the beasts feasting on what was, fortunately, unrecognizable as a human. They were a bit smaller than the first he‚Äôd fought, and this time when he threw his spear he hit one in the neck, killing it instantly. The second didn‚Äôt last much longer as he took it down in a couple swings.

‚ÄúIt was always suspected that the Clawed Jungle Lions were monsters, not natural animals, due to a lack of related species,‚Äù Nallia spoke, ‚Äúthis simply confirms it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Naturalist Guild will be thrilled,‚Äù Orlan replied over the telepathic channel in a dry tone, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a group of people in the southern end of this building, can you clear a path for them to run to the national guard?‚Äù

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt be too hard,‚Äù Lailra replied, ‚Äúmost of us landed a bit short of where you are but we‚Äôll catch up soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúBe careful, Lord,‚Äù Nallia added, ‚Äúmy spells are picking up something odd closer to the rift.‚Äù

‚ÄúAn alpha?‚Äù Orlan asked, already dashing down another hall.

‚ÄúPerhaps, hard to tell, these beasts are rather hard to pick up with magic, especially at long range,‚Äù she explained, ‚Äúcould be a pack of tier three beasts, or a few tier four who have a shrouding ability.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can handle a couple tier four long armed cats.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, don‚Äôt,‚Äù Lailra pleaded, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve no easy way back to the island, meaning we can‚Äôt rely on getting back for magical healing.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be careful,‚Äù Orlan promised, jumping over a crushed counter of a coffee shop and driving his spear into the back of the beast that was too busy rummaging around to notice him. Probably the coffee grounds overwhelming its nose, he figured, not turning down the opening.

‚ÄúFor survivors, I‚Äôm seeing only a few scattered individuals across the main airport,‚Äù Nallia continued, ‚Äúthere are a few groups in the separate buildings, but you probably ran into the largest group.‚Äù

‚ÄúShould we assist the, you called them National Guard?‚Äù Pela asked suddenly over the telepathic channel, ‚Äútheir guns are drawing in a lot of the beasts.‚Äù

‚ÄúLailra,‚Äù Orlan ordered, ‚Äútake two others with you to hold the line, we‚Äôre going to use the National Guard as the anvil to our hammer.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt have them breaking,‚Äù Lailra agreed, ‚Äúthen Pela and Nallia, with me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe rest of you, form teams of two or three and sweep the outlying buildings for survivors, avoid large groups of beasts if you can, eliminate or draw away those you can‚Äôt,‚Äù Orlan continued, ‚Äúonce we‚Äôve got as many out as we can we‚Äôll group up and go after that alpha.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Lord Orlan,‚Äù came a chorus of mental replies.

\-\-\-\-\-

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt focus too many guns on one target!‚Äù Lieutenant Leewald shouted to be heard over the roar of multiple fifty caliber machine guns. The heavy, anti-material rounds were enough to drive the creatures back, but didn‚Äôt seem able to kill them, or at least not quickly. The idea of a living creature that found fifty cal only painful, but not lethal, was hard to imagine, but he supposed he didn‚Äôt have to imagine any more.

He'd been briefed on ‚Äòanti creature tactics‚Äô repeatedly over the last couple years, ever since the things started appearing. Every time another portal opened the analysts would alter those tactics, requiring more briefings and more training. He‚Äôd listened to the briefings, and done the training, but in the back of his mind he hadn‚Äôt actually expected to see a giant cat shrug off rounds from what was considered a light anti-tank bullet. Perhaps ‚Äòshrug off‚Äô was a bit overstating it, they yelped in pain and dove behind rocks or into ditches, often emerging with a modest wound, but they weren‚Äôt reduced to bloody chunks like the bullet should have.

The chainguns of the Bradelys were better, but it still took a good moment of directed fire to ensure a creature would stay down, and those things chewed through ammo. And it didn‚Äôt help that some of the creatures seemed even tougher for some reason, treating the chainguns like the rest of them treated the fifties.

‚ÄúLT,‚Äù a voice drew his attention, ‚Äúsome of the men reported seeing a figure, well, flying through the air and crashing into the southern terminal.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Leewald asked.

‚ÄúSaid it looked like superman or something,‚Äù the private shrugged, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve also got a group of people running this direction from the East.‚Äù

‚ÄúMore survivors?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre running fast‚Ä¶ faster than people should run. And, apparently, they‚Äôre killing the creatures,‚Äù the man said, looking over his shoulder for a moment, ‚Äúdo you think it‚Äôs that protector guy?‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt he way out near Bermuda or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúOur Lord found a way to make it here,‚Äù a woman‚Äôs voice responded and, in a burst of flames, the most beautiful woman Leewald had ever seen appeared next to him. She wore a long red dress that was covered strategically in finely engraved metal plates, somehow managing to straddle the line between evening dress and armor. Arching one of her eyebrows at him she asked, ‚Äúare you in charge here?‚Äù

‚ÄúLieutenant Leewald, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù the LT nodded.

‚ÄúLieutenant? You don‚Äôt look like navy,‚Äù she remarked, looking him over before shaking her head, ‚Äúas I was saying, Lord Orlan managed to arrive in time to assist, I‚Äôm here to reinforce your position. From now on your main goal is to provide a secure point for survivors to escape to.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith all due respect,‚Äù Leewald said, shaking off her beauty and sudden appearance, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt take orders from‚Ä¶ whatever it is you are.‚Äù

Just as he was about to continue a wave of translucent green vines rose up in front of the national guard line, diving forward over the ground. Dozens of the creatures were swept up in the tide, thorns from the almost ghostly vines dug into their flesh, and wherever blood was drawn the flesh and skin would begin to rot away.

‚ÄúA secure fallback point? You got it,‚Äù Leewald corrected himself, turning to the private, ‚Äútell everyone to dig in, I want an aid station and space for survivors set up.‚Äù

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù the private nodded, finally tearing his eyes away from the woman and running off to relay the orders. Leewald turned back just in time to see the woman rising into the air, standing on a cloud of flames and smoke, a lance of fire made solid shooting out to impale one of the few creatures that escaped the vines. Shaking his head he grabbed his radio to issue more orders.

\-\-\-\-\-

‚ÄúMy lord,‚Äù Nallia‚Äôs voice came suddenly nearly an hour later, ‚Äúthat anomaly I sensed is on the move.‚Äù

‚ÄúShit,‚Äù Orlan swore aloud before asking on the telepathic channel, ‚Äúwhere is it heading?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight for you,‚Äù she answered, ‚Äúand quickly, you‚Äôve got a minute or two, tops.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going outside,‚Äù Orlan said as he ran towards the nearest large glass window, stepping through space and reappearing in the air beyond it, falling towards the tarmac a story below him, ‚Äúcan anyone make it here?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got our hands full protecting the army,‚Äù Lailra spoke up.

‚ÄúNo one can make it to you before it arrives,‚Äù Nallia added.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see anything behind me,‚Äù Orlan said as his feet hit the ground and he continued running, putting distance between himself and the gates.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in the building you just left, still on your tail.‚Äù

Cursing under his breath Orlan ran, his feet leaving imprints in the solid concrete as he picked up speed. Seconds later he heard a loud crash behind him, glancing back he saw at least five creatures that, while similar looking to the rest of the beasts they‚Äôd fought, were each half again as large.

‚ÄúNot an alpha, a pack of stronger beasts,‚Äù Orlan said as the beasts sprinted after him, ‚Äúlooks like they‚Äôre easily tier four, I‚Äôm not going to be able to outrun them.‚Äù

As he spoke he skid to a halt, spinning his spear and entering a defensive stance to prepare for their arrival.

‚ÄúMy lord! Back!‚Äù Nallia‚Äôs voice shouted in his mind, and Orlan replied without hesitation, jumping backwards five feet. Just as he did he felt and saw something tear through where he‚Äôd just been, striking the ground a good forty feet away in an explosion of dust and rock.

‚ÄúThe hell,‚Äù Orlan asked, glancing in the direction the attack had come from for a moment, not seeing anything before he was forced to return his gaze to the oncoming beasts.

‚ÄúAira is on her way, should be with you in five minutes,‚Äù Lailra said in his mind, ‚Äúhold out until then.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think someone is taking shots at me,‚Äù Orlan replied, ‚Äúsouthwest of my position, a sniper.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere was mana in that attack,‚Äù Nallia agreed, ‚ÄúI could barely sense it though.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Orlan grumbled, ducking as the first of the stronger beasts swiped at him, lifting his spear to cut the underside of the long, sloth like arm, barely managing to draw blood before he had to step aside to avoid another attack from a different beast. At least in this melee, the sniper would have a hard time getting a shot, he though dryly to himself as he fought.

1hyxgip,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1hyxgip/gfci_wall_taps/,GFCI wall taps?,"So my wife wants to use some wall taps in the kitchen. It's a 1 to 6 with some USB outlets. 

The appliances that will be plugged into this will exceed 15 amps. (Coffee maker, toaster, teapot) 

Under normal operation our 15A breaker will trip is how I know this. So we only use one of the devices at a time as to not overload the circuit. 

Now my concern with these wall taps is...  
1. The design: So these are not designed to go over a GFCI outlet. They have a center screw that's supposed to go into a regular duplex outlet. Of course on some of the Amazon product pages they say, just take out the screw and slam that baby in there. So....I'd be concerned w/ only one plug the weight of the unit and plugs are wholly sitting on a single plug. 

  
2. While I know by design these taps CAN be designed to only use one plug, my concern is weight. Since we're not affixing any of these to anything other than the plug, it would seem to me having two full plugs would help maintain better support of the device w/in the plug. 

3. 15A through a tap seems like a lot. Sure some of them are rated for 15A but IDK if I want to eff around and find out w/ a poorly produced wall tap. I guess the breaker offers some protection, but running a tiny device like that at capacity makes me nervous. 

So all of these outlets are in the kitchen. I'm not opposed to wring in something more logical...but if there are GFCI taps you'd recommend....I'm all ears. ",1,1736607039.0,homeowners,3,1.0,False
1hyxg50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Europetravel/comments/1hyxg50/6_week_europe_vacation_planningpacking/,6 week Europe Vacation - Planning/Packing Recommendations...,"Hi there, I'm planning a 6 week Europe vacation leaving this August and returning in October. I've booked my flight with Iclandair. I'm in my mid-50s and have some disabilities that make things a bit difficult for me, so looking at trying to keep things easier. Here's my itinerary...

* Ireland
* No. Ireland
* Hopper flight to Edinburgh, Scotland
* England
* Chunnel to France
* Italy (flying out from Rome)
* Iceland (for one night on my way back)

For the trip:

* I am doing quite a few tours (mostly book/movie/TV related), so that will make things easier. I also plan on seeing a lot of castles, but those easy to get to.
* I am staying in Airbnbs or Hostels (I've stayed in them before - am requesting bottom bunks).
* Making sure I'm staying in places with washer/dryers and am trying my best to bring only 4 days worth of light weight clothing (which I can rewear if I have to) all of the same color scheme so I can wash them together (no jeans - I've already learned the hard way about jeans in Europe - had to stand next to a dryer for 5 hours...), a light weight rain jacket, and one pants liner if it gets cold (I'm from an area where it gets cold, so temps in the 50s is fine for me).
* I am bringing a nicer camera, but no extra lenses, and my ipad.
* I want to use a good backpack (not an expensive one, mainly b/c I feel like that's a target for being pickpocketed) to pack everything in and use only that. I plan on removing my clothing from my bag while out and about.
* I have good Merrell waterproof shoes, so I'm good there (those are the only shoes I'm bringing - except flipflops for the showers).
* Despite being female, I don't use accessories. I don't use a purse. I have a strong cross-body strap for my phone and a small wallet attached to it. I will use a different passport holder for special items.

My questions are:

* do you think it's possible to keep my bag under 15lb? I have neck issues, so would like to  stay under this weight. I honestly thought I was going to be using a bag on wheels, but that would probably be more difficult/heavier when having to carry up/down stairs, lift, etc. I've purchased one bag I think will work (want one that will resist rain and this one has the small compression bags for packing) and will return if it doesn't. Went to REI and couldn't find one I liked.
* I'm with AT&T for phone and iPad. What is the best option in your opinion about being able to use cell service when needed? Some of my tours are out in the wilds of Scotland, so... EDIT: I see the recommendation auto post about the EU sim card. Any recommendations on which ones to use? I have android. And then the iPad 10th gen.
* Safety. I am a lone female, which I'm used to, but I know that any kind of item that can be used as a weapon is not allowed at least in the UK. I know there are whistles I can use. Can anyone recommend something like this for some kind of protection? Can/should I purchase prior to getting there?
* Bathroom items... I will bring the very minimum with me and plan on buying more while over there. Any recommendations on where/what (brands) to buy?
* Food... Since I'll be on a lot of tours, what kind of good snack items do you recommend? I'm honestly not a big restaurant eater, but I am (admittedly) a coffee snob. lol
* I'm going to use the Eurail pass for most of the trip. sometimes I'll have to take buses. I also have some friends who'll be giving me rides. :D Any hints on using the Eurail pass?
* Anything else you can recommend.

Thankfully I have friends in England and France I'll be visiting. My brother will happen to be in No Ireland the same time as I am, so that's a bonus. :)

I appreciate any input you can provide. Thank you!!! :)",1,1736607007.0,Europetravel,3,1.0,False

I'm sure any upgrade from an 8 year old laptop is going to be a big improvement. What's annoyed me as of late is rendering even for my basic video editing because some times might take 25-40 minutes on an 8 minute video. While rendering, my computer is slow as fuck even for browsing. I also noticed my media player some times takes literally 5-7 seconds to load a video or even opening an image file it now starts to lag a couple seconds.

Some of the stuff I use for my videos: usb webcam, usb microphone, usb external 2TB hard drive, usb keyboard/mouse, Sony MDR 7506 headphone jack (the big jack), hdmi LG wide screen monitor... I noticed some Macbooks only allow 1 or 2 external monitors.. I have been thinking about getting a 2nd monitor but not sure yet. A video card slot is a bonus (big and micro sd card slots, but I have a usb hub if not). That's pretty much it. 

I was look at the new Macbook M4 pro for $2000 but I dunno if I really need all that but not 100% sure. That's why I'm here. I don't mind refurbished too as long as its safe. Maybe a Macbook Air? I dunno...

1hyxfga,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hyxfga/now_that_god_has_revealed_himself_none_of_us_are/,"Now that God has revealed himself, none of us are allowed to die.","It was a Thursday when God revealed himself to all of humanity.

The day started ordinary enough, but sometime in the afternoon, I felt a presence in my chest and a voice in my ear:

*‚ÄúI have returned,‚Äù* the voice said.

As it just so happened that *everyone* had heard that voice, *everyone* felt that presence, and soon *everyone* stepped out of their dwellings and looked up at the sky and saw the clouds disappear and a brilliant light shine for just an instant, a moment, a light so brilliant it couldn‚Äôt have belonged to the sun and it had to have been something else.

And it was clear. The feeling in our hearts was certain. The lord was real, and he was here.¬†

What happened next was likely what you would‚Äôve expected.

The world became kinder‚Äîmore compassionate. Not by virtue of an intrinsic force of goodness overtaking us, but rather, the fear of retribution. You didn‚Äôt want to fight, didn‚Äôt want to insult, didn‚Äôt want to judge, because you didn‚Äôt know what would happen when you did. *A safe life,* with the recent supernatural developments, was one that contained a bit more charity, a bit more turning the other cheek, and a bit more feigned grace. *Fake it ‚Äòtil you make it,* after all.¬†

I watched for signs of what would change next. We were all under the watchful eye, but it least *felt*‚Äîincorrectly, we would realize‚Äîthat the almighty‚Äôs interventions had been minimal so far.

Everyone found out at their own pace that death had become a thing of the past.

Some knew immediately‚Äîwhen their loved ones in hospice care saw remarkable turnarounds in health.

Others missed the memo until mass consensus had been established, when scientists and statisticians alike revealed that by every known metric‚Äînatural disasters, car crashes, heart attacks‚Äîthat the number of daily reported deaths had plummeted from an average of 160,000 to zero.¬†

Life went on, and as it did, I started hearing whispers of what *worship* was. Depending on who you talked to, online or at the watercooler, you‚Äôd hear a different rumor, a different interpretation.

It wasn‚Äôt until my mom was called upon that I knew what it was. I remember it vividly.¬†

7 o‚Äôclock, after dinner, Mom got up from her seat in the living room, got ready, donned her coat, stepped towards the shoe rack.

‚ÄúWhere you heading, hun?‚Äù my father asked her.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been summoned.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe lord has summoned me for worship.‚Äù

I remember just how *odd* the moment felt. Life had been tinged with a certain unreality since the grand question was blown wide open. Seeing Mom head for the door both did and didn‚Äôt make any sense. Had it been any other year, we would‚Äôve thought she was doing a bit.

‚ÄúDid you, uhh‚Ä¶ need a ride?‚Äù my Dad asked confusedly.

‚ÄúThe lord would like me to walk,‚Äù she responded. Then she turned the knob and went outside.

I was seventeen at the time. My brother was twenty. We both asked Dad if we should follow her. He told us to stay home‚Äîthat he‚Äôd accompany her and figure out what was going on.¬†

He didn‚Äôt return until the next evening. We rushed downstairs when we heard the front door open, hoping we‚Äôd catch both parents entering. Instead, it was just him**,** disheveled, weary, a a muted expression on his face.

I‚Äôll never forget the way he looked at us.¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs standing in a field,‚Äù he said. Then‚Äî‚ÄúThere are other people there, too.‚Äù

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Four months passed since Mom was first called to worship.¬†

During that time, we learned something more about God‚Äôs ‚Äúinterventions.‚Äù

The ‚ÄúNew Commandments‚Äù as I‚Äôd termed them in my brain, were panning out as the following:

1. Thou Shalt Not Die (via disease, natural disasters, etc.)
2. Thou Shalt Be Called to Worship at a Random Time¬†

Now I‚Äôll admit neither of those are as catchy as the OG Commandments. This is, after all, not the official word of the lord, merely just my reading of the tea leaves.

‚ÄúCommandment 3‚Äù came to me in a dream. *Kidding*‚Äîit came to me in a Youtube video.

It was your usual street fight video. Two guys on a sidewalk corner, for reasons unknown, exchanging blows, until the bigger of the two got the upper hand and started *wailing and wailing,* then secured a knife and‚Äî

Like a lightbulb went off in his head, stopped, lifted himself from his rival.¬†

The guy getting his ass handed to him stood up also.

And then both of them just‚Ä¶ walked. Single-file, empty expressions on their faces. Manchurian candidate shit.¬†

So:

1. If Thou Attempt to Kill Another, Thou Shalt Immediately Be Summoned to Worship.¬†

Was the takeaway.

But what‚Äîpray tell‚Äîwas worship *really?*

I visited my mom one afternoon to understand better.

The spot she had journeyed to was an hour‚Äôs drive from home, so she must‚Äôve trekked for *hours* that first night.

I arrived at the field, to the sight of thousands of people standing evenly spaced‚Äîthree feet apart in every direction. They all faced the same way, heads tilted slightly towards the sky, perfectly still. No movement.¬†

I maneuvered the rows for what felt like an endless amount of time. When I finally found her, it genuinely felt like I just got lucky.

It was my first time seeing her since she‚Äôd been gone. I had mentally convinced myself that there was no need for me to come out here. After all, she‚Äôd be coming home‚Äî*any day now.*¬†

‚Äú*Mom.*‚Äù I‚Äôll admit, I was a bit emotional.

To my surprise, despite her fixed posture and eyes tilted up, her mouth moved. ‚ÄúHi sweetheart.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm well. I am in worship.‚Äù

She wasn‚Äôt totally being herself. ‚ÄúMom, are you able to move?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am in *worship*,‚Äù she repeated.¬†

‚ÄúBut do you want to come home?‚Äù

The softness in her tone didn‚Äôt change, but it did seem like she was imbuing her words with some kind of subtext. Trying to say something more. ‚Äú*I can‚Äôt, love.‚Äù* And then, enunciated even clearer, ‚ÄúI think you should *go home. Perhaps before you‚Äôre forced to stay too.*‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äú*Home.* Get going now dear.‚Äù

I told her I loved her then departed through the gathering of worshippers, all of them laid out so absolutely perfectly. Like a chessboard‚Äîeveryone had their spot. And there was plenty‚Äî*plenty*‚Äîof land to go. So much so that I had to wonder what spots myself, my friends, Dad, older brother and everyone I‚Äôd ever loved would potentially occupy one day.

En route, I spotted a few other visitors. They looked more morose than I was. They whispered words of affirmation and love to their respective persons, *hearing responses sure* but said responses from the corner of their loved ones' mouths seeming light, quiet, curt, God-centric. Like they were standing at someone‚Äôs gravesite‚Äîalbeit more a statue than a grave. A commemoration of someone long gone.

But no one was really gone. Mom hadn‚Äôt *left*. Worship would be over soon, it had to **be**. Maybe another couple of weeks, couple months at most, and then she‚Äôd be home, and the lord would call someone else to take her place.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. When Thou Art in Worship, Thou Shalt Not Age.

‚ÄúCommandment 4‚Äù became common knowledge a year later.

The amount of folks called to worship had steadily gone up during this time. This was global, of course, so anyone curious could at any time look up a livestream of the designated ‚Äúworship areas‚Äù around the world to see people standing uniformly, frozen, perfectly spaced**,** in parks, beaches, city squares, you name it. Every town, every city had its *place.*

My place, I supposed, would be the same field where Mom was, unless it filled up by the time it was my turn, in which case it could very well have been somewhere completely random and unknown.¬†

The *no aging* revelation was again something discerned by the ever-decreasing amount of practicing scientists on the planet. Outside of worship, life was still progressing normally more or less, except for that final, tricky, ‚Äúdeath‚Äù step.

*‚ÄúWorship grief‚Äù* was a real term now‚Äîthe experience of losing someone to God, essentially. Not yet coined was the secret counterpart buried in all our brains that God knows, *literally,* we weren‚Äôt brave enough to speak: *worship fear.*

I tried my best to keep my thoughts pure. I couldn‚Äôt help but assume that thoughts of blasphemy contained within the 17 or so centimeters of my brain were fair game for our omnipotent ruler to scrutinize. It was a nice fantasy though‚Äîthe idea that there might be a spot, a street corner without God‚Äôs CCTV camera. Somewhere you could just be *you* without fear that your insubordination would expedite the ticket to your special place on God‚Äôs canvas.

Support groups existed, and so I joined one, and that‚Äôs where the ‚Äúno aging‚Äù element of worship was first pitched to me as one of the many *pros* of the whole construction. I didn‚Äôt find Commandment 4 comforting, but I smiled and nodded nonetheless.

The world was still the world but less so. I‚Äôd take the train to work and notice that the average of people‚Äôs expressions had gone from *tired* and *cranky* to subtly mortified. I once saw a woman break down and start crying, and I can almost swear she said under her breath, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go.‚Äù Or maybe I was just projecting.

Nightmares weren‚Äôt the same anymore. The worst dream I could have now wasn‚Äôt one where I was being chased by a murderer or caught in a storm‚Äîrather, the one where I would stop in place while I was doing something mundane. I would hear a voice in my head. The voice would say, ‚Äú*You have been summoned.*‚Äù My feet would start walking on their own, and I‚Äôd know exactly where I was going, even if I didn‚Äôt know where it was.¬†

I‚Äôd jolt awake in my bed, sweating. *Praying,* funny as it were, that I still had executive function. That, and the little moments where I‚Äôd feel a random twitch or spasm in my leg‚Äîthose were the killers.

And then four years passed, and it must‚Äôve been close to thirty percent of the global population then in worship, my Dad an unfortunate addition to that communion.

My brother and I never got a chance to see him exit stage left into the crowd‚Äîthe day that he was called upon, he was out and about. I believe he‚Äôd gone to see the mechanic, and maybe had a physio appointment on the docket afterwards too. That didn‚Äôt matter now. We held out hope until the third day of him being gone.¬†

The field where Mom stood was full now, and at this point our city had quite a few landmarks for congregation. My brother and I took turns visiting these different areas to see if we could maybe catch our Dad standing amongst the crowd. No luck.¬†

Around then, I started coming around to what the ‚Äúfifth‚Äù Commandment might‚Äôve been. Again, this was just me spitballing, but getting any sense of *rules* or *structure* during this time was oddly a place of comfort. It was nice to know what, if any, parameters there were to this.

It was a redundant rule really, as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll understand once I spell it out clearly. The thought came to me when I‚Äôd see people standing atop high-rises, right close to the edge, as if they were about to leap. And then‚Ä¶ they‚Äôd just turn around.

Or when I‚Äôd spot people on the bridge, walking alongside the cars, albeit robotically. And I‚Äôd wonder if I was just being a cynic, or if maybe some of the pedestrians strolling alongside traffic had originally arrived with ulterior motives.

With my brother‚Äôs mistake, it all became clear.

I walked into his room one day to catch him sitting at his desk, a gun pressed to his temple, his hand trembling, the barrel shaking, finger resting on the trigger.¬†

I froze in place, and I‚Äôll admit, I had the following thought:

*Please, please God let the bullet pass through his skull. Let him die.*

Instead, the gun fell to the ground. His hand ceased quaking.¬†

He stood up from his chair, walked to his closet, grabbed his coat, put it on.¬†

‚ÄúMarkus?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúJust gonna head out,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúTo‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúWorship,‚Äù he said, matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been called upon.‚Äù

He headed for the front door. I trailed.

‚Äú*Markus*,‚Äù I said again. He ignored me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Äîlisten‚ÄîI‚Äôm, uh, only asking out of curiosity.‚Äù I tried not to sign my own release form with my words. ‚ÄúAre you able to control your body *at all?* Even a little bit?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo and I am going to worship.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you were feeling the call, it would be clear to you too, and now I need to go.‚Äù¬†

He grabbed his shoes.

I walked him the whole way there‚Äîfive hours‚Äîuntil he took his spot in the cleared out parking lot of a now-defunct amusement park, alongside thousands of men, women, and children.

He didn‚Äôt say anything to me on the trek there, though to be fair, I didn‚Äôt say much to him either.

1. If Thou Attempt to Take Thine Own Life‚ÄîYou Guessed It, Thou Salt Immediately Be Summoned to Worship.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Gallows humor. The world coped with gallows humor.

70% of the world after all, give or take, was in the *worship* state now.

I tried my best not to think about it. Standing still, head turned towards the sky, body frozen for weeks, months, or in the case of my Mom and Dad‚Äî*years* on end.¬†

It was selfish, but I would struggle to visit my mother. When I did go, it would be for a quick side-hug, a quick ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù and then a hasty exit. I would always wish that she were in a deep trance state, too out of it to return the greeting, but she was instead *consistently* lucid.

‚ÄúLove you too, sweetheart,‚Äù she‚Äôd say, way too presently. It made me uncomfortable. To be that awake, that aware of what was going on‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt like it. The headcanon I was trying to run with was that worship would be a blissful, effortless, dreamlike state. All of the evidence was to the contrary.

To God‚Äôs credit, it seemed like we could talk about *worship fear* quite openly. Certainly, all of the support groups, online communities and such were reflecting a different, more *honest* state for man.

Youtube videos and TikTok clips talking about a ‚Äúsurefire way to escape‚Äù‚Äîtactics to *reality shift* out of this timeline to another. Deep states of meditation that would allow you to pass peacefully without being summoned to one of God‚Äôs many gathering grounds. And of course, all too many video essays, scrutinizing the Lord. Complaining about the state of things. Calling for revolution‚Äîmadness, really.¬†

There were two moments that stuck with me‚Äîmoments that really captured the spirit of things.

The first was the final video of that guy who was planning an elaborate, Rube-Goldberg-esque escape from his physical body. Doused himself and his room in gasoline, held a string tied to a blade suspended above his head, had a timer with an explosion counting down. I commended the hell out of his effort. The moment hit‚Äîhe tossed a match from his seat to the corner. Flames ignited, he pulled the string, and then‚Äî-

The fire fizzled as soon as it reached him. The blade froze in mid-air. The explosion never happened (thank goodness, really, as the camera footage eventually discovered and uploaded was *gold*), and then our friend got up from his seat, still dripping and flammable, and walked out of frame.¬†

Commandment 5, my friend. Commandment 5.

The other was the video of that big streamer who kept faking that he‚Äôd been ‚Äúsummoned‚Äù while live on Twitch. His face would go blank, he‚Äôd get up from his seat, and he‚Äôd mechanically step out of his room. He‚Äôd done the fake-out so many times, that when it was the real thing, chat was in denial for *hours.*¬†

Hilariously horrifying.

People still worked, still clung to routine, but it was pretty fruitless. I‚Äôd see street preachers with a megaphone, telling us that ‚Äúour time was soon,‚Äù like, *no shit, my guy.*¬† Apple, despite most of their workforce having clocked out permanently, *still* managed to come out with new products somehow. Streaming was mainly reruns, however. Probably hard to commit to a full season of material when your director, lead actor, lead writer, and everyone else on set could step out at a moment‚Äôs notice and never come back.

Less workers everywhere you went, but hey, it made sense. *Less customers and all.*

I picked up a coffee from the Starbucks in my area that still had employees, and went off to see my brother.

It‚Äôd been two years. *His* was the hardest one for me. After all, I knew deep down he wouldn‚Äôt have wanted me to pity him. But *holy shit did I*.

I returned to the parking lot. It was much busier with people now‚Äîat capacity, it seemed. I maneuvered the gaps and finally got to him.¬†

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúHow is it?‚Äù

I saw his chest expand and contract with his steady breaths. Head lifted. Eyes angled up.¬†

‚ÄúHow is it?‚Äù I asked again.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm in *worship,‚Äù* he said.

‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôll probably be my time soon too,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHelp me prepare.‚Äù

Again, he said nothing.

‚ÄúBro,‚Äù I said.

It took him a while to finally speak. ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthe thought I think about the most, is that some random bullet could be flying around somehow. Just a random bullet, fired from hundreds of miles away. And it gets past God‚Äôs radar. And it catches me in the back of the head. And it all goes black for me. It‚Äôs my favorite thought. It‚Äôs the dream that‚Äôs keeping me going.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything‚ÄîI *couldn‚Äôt* say anything.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a feeling in my chest‚Äîa sureness. This isn‚Äôt going to stop.‚Äù

I felt trapped.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna go on for eternity. No heat death. Just this.‚Äù

I put my hand on his shoulder. An empty gesture, really. I think I just needed something to help keep me upright.

‚Äú*Please find a way to kill me*,‚Äù he said.¬†

And then I had to go.

I think I heard him say, ‚Äú*Please stay, I need conversation,*‚Äù or maybe I imagined it, or maybe I heard it bang-on clear but I didn‚Äôt want to think about it because it made me feel like shit.

Survivorship bias is a really strange feeling to have when you‚Äôre still on the sinking Titanic. Sure, your section of the ship isn‚Äôt submerged *yet,* but you would be there soon enough with Leo and the gang.¬†

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Whoever was keeping track had stopped counting. Almost everyone was gone.¬†

It was dumb luck, pure and simple. Dumb luck that I hadn‚Äôt been called upon yet.

My soft research started the moment Dad disappeared, but you can be damn sure it escalated after the conversation with my brother.

I approached everything with an open mind and tried anything I could. Specific meditations, incantations, *prayers to the lord* for the global worship session to end. I went to specific coordinates and towns where rumor had it, *people could actually die.* My trips were immeasurably disappointing. No death to be found anywhere.

The old constants‚Äîdeath and taxes.

The new constants‚Äîimmortality and worship.¬†

I was en route to my eightieth or so desperate attempt to find salvation (see: annihilation). A picture of a flyer that was shared to one of the many ‚Äú*holy shit we need to die ASAP‚Äù* groups I was a part of detailed the church that one Rev. Lucien Ferrer was practicing at. He made lofty promises about his support group that I was sure he wouldn‚Äôt be able to deliver on, the bottom of the flier reading much like a pyramid scheme: *Join a community with a surefire solution to worship fear! No testimonials because we have a 100% success rate! Come and see the miracle for yourself!*¬†

But, *eh.* Desperate times and all that nonsense.

I made the four hour drive, on the way spotting some of the *many, many, many* new landmarks of people gathered, perfectly spaced apart, facing the same direction, heads slanted upwards, locked in perpetual admiration for the lord.

It felt like my time was closing in. Like I‚Äôd stop the car any moment now‚Äîstep out, walk along the side of the road until I reached my place.¬†

I arrived at the destination.¬†

The Church looked desolate from the outside. Looked long abandoned. No clue what Reverend Lucien was running here, but hey, if it was just a prank, *he got me.*

I stepped inside, and then I felt it.

The *lack.* The lack of the feeling of the lord in my chest. It felt like my bond with the creator had been severed.¬†

By the entrance, there was a table with a sign-in form and a pen. I scribbled my name and the time.¬†

The interior stretched quite long. I took a seat in the pews. There were a few others seated in the rows. They looked like they‚Äôd been waiting for quite some time.

After a little while, a man came out on the stage. ‚ÄúJust gonna be a couple more hours, but he should be seeing to all of you soon,‚Äù he said.

It felt like I was at the doctor‚Äôs office for an appointment.

He didn‚Äôt reappear for quite some time as promised. Time stood still. I heard the *tick tick tick* of the clock. My hands on my legs. *Don‚Äôt move involuntarily, don‚Äôt move involuntarily‚Äî*

He came out, called someone else‚Äôs name: ‚ÄúThomas Gilmore? Is Thomas Gilmore here?‚Äù

And sure enough Thomas got up from his seat, and followed the man to the back.

*Tick. Tick. Tick.*

‚ÄúEve Merritt? Eve?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me!‚Äù her hand shot up. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me,‚Äù and off she went to the back.

*Tick. Tick. Tick.*

I really, truly, didn‚Äôt know how much time I had left.¬†

‚ÄúIt just says *Lily,* here,‚Äù he said, eyeing the sheet. ‚ÄúLily?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just in the bathroom,‚Äù another stranger said.

‚ÄúAlright. We‚Äôll take her when she‚Äôs back.‚Äù

And then the sun was going down.

How long would this support session run for?

I couldn‚Äôt wait for them to close up shop for the evening.

I couldn‚Äôt come back tomorrow.

I couldn‚Äôt wait‚Äî*I couldn‚Äôt fucking*‚Äî

‚ÄúAlright, got a Jake Miller here? Jake‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúMe!‚Äù I shouted.

Immediately, I stood from my seat. I had the horrific thought that my body would turn itself around, I‚Äôd leave the Church, and walk right into the sunset, but instead my footsteps made their way up the aisle and then I was standing right in front of him.

‚ÄúTo the back,‚Äù he said, and I followed him there, a rather confusing and twisting pathway past closed doors, boxes, mess, and hallways until we got there. To‚Äî

*A* *confessional booth.*

‚ÄúIn there?‚Äù I asked him.

‚ÄúIn there,‚Äù he said.

I entered the booth.

There was blood on the seat.

*Blood.* What a novel sight.¬†

‚ÄúTake a seat, don‚Äôt worry about the dried‚Äîy‚Äôknow, it‚Äôs fine. You‚Äôll be good. Sit,‚Äù said who I presumed was the priest sitting on the other side of the partition. I did as he requested.¬†¬†

‚ÄúReverend Lucien?‚Äù I asked.

It took him a second to respond‚Äîto register. ‚ÄúAh, yeah, *yes.* Rev. Lucien. *Sure.*‚Äù

‚ÄúUh‚Äî‚Äù I continued, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt really done this‚Ä¶ *confessional* thing before but I guess, are you supposed to ask me to confess*‚Ä¶ something?*‚Äù

‚ÄúYes! Please confess whatever is on your mind.‚Äù

I took a second to gather my thoughts. ‚ÄúRight, yes, so‚Äî‚Äù

I heard the sound of something being cleaned by a cloth, followed by a deliberate, echoing snap. *Was he eating?*

‚ÄúRight, so, I‚ÄîI *saw your ad,* found your ad rather, and uhm, yeah I‚Ä¶ suffer from *worship fear,* I guess, I don‚Äôt want to uh, *commit blasphemy* against the lord or anything but‚Äî‚Äù

I heard the echo of another bite. *Jesus, a little rude man.*

‚ÄúBut uh, *yeah,* not sure if I wanna‚Ä¶ stand in a field for a hundred years, in uh, *worship,* I guess‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúS‚Äônot a hundred years,‚Äù he said, chewing loudly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs forever. Eternity. That was his little project.‚Äù

‚ÄúHis little *what now*?‚Äù

‚ÄúHeaven on Earth. *Eternity.* That was always the plan. For all of you to become one with the lord for the rest of time. ‚ÄòCourse he wanted to show up when there was the most people, right?‚Äù he said, crunching. ‚ÄúLike, probably‚Ä¶‚Äù he stifled a laugh, ‚Äúprobably less exciting when it‚Äôs fucking *cavemen,* right? Billions of people? Or ten thousand cavemen? Which would *you* choose?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, what does this have to do with anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing, nothing, sorry, please continue.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I said, gathering, ‚Äúand uh, I mean no I guess that was it. It said you have a surefire solution? On your ad.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI can kill you.‚Äù

‚Äú*You can kill me?*‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Right here. Right now. ‚ÄòCourse, if you need time to think about it, it‚Äôs a no. And if you step out of the church, God will summon you right then and there to be a part of the flock.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Äîwhat, *how* would you know that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your answer? There are people waiting, and I‚Äôm a busy guy. Busy, *busy* Reverend.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚ÄîI mean, the answer would be yes, but that‚Äôd be in violation of *Commandment 3*‚Äîerr, sorry, I guess, y*ou don‚Äôt know what that is*. Basically, I‚Äôve been trying to keep track of everything and *Commandment 3* is my shorthand for the whole, *if you try to‚Äî*‚Äù

Suddenly the partition fell. Swiftly came the knife into my jugular.

I couldn‚Äôt believe it.¬†

Blood spilled onto my shirt, my legs.¬†

I gagged, my vision blurring as I tried to focus on the man who delivered the blow. The man who had a bloody knife in one hand, half-eaten apple in the other.

‚ÄúThe lord and I have an agreement,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe has his space, and I have mine. Albeit, this one is *much smaller* than what I‚Äôm used to.‚Äù

I felt my head lower involuntarily. My eyes acclimated to the final shot‚Äîmyself drenched in red.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome,‚Äù I think I heard him say.

And then it all went black.

1hyxfbo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hyxfbo,2024 highlights - coffee,"It was a palate adventure of a year. I didn't manage to track everything but this is a lot of it.

The Father Coffee SuperSub was a great way to get exposed to a bunch of different coffees each month and they included some amazing decaf coffees over the year. El Paraiso and El Diviso were standout producers but actually most if not all of them were really good.

Getting to try a sneak peak of Hachi Coffee Project was a real treat (big thanks to the Father Coffee team for sharing some with me).

The Inspiration Advent Calendar from The Barn was also a lot of fun.

Roasteries I enjoyed this past year:

* Father Coffee
* Onyx Coffee Lab
* Bluebird Coffee Roastery

1hyxfbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1hyxfbh/gfci_and_wall_taps/,GFCI and Wall Taps,"So my wife wants to use some wall taps in the kitchen. It's a 1 to 6 with some USB outlets. 

The appliances that will be plugged into this will exceed 15 amps. (Coffee maker, toaster, teapot) 

Under normal operation our 15A breaker will trip is how I know this. So we only use one of the devices at a time as to not overload the circuit. 

Now my concern with these wall taps is...  
1. The design: So these are not designed to go over a GFCI outlet. They have a center screw that's supposed to go into a regular duplex outlet. Of course on some of the Amazon product pages they say, just take out the screw and slam that baby in there. So....I'd be concerned w/ only one plug the weight of the unit and plugs are wholly sitting on a single plug. 

  
2. While I know by design these taps CAN be designed to only use one plug, my concern is weight. Since we're not affixing any of these to anything other than the plug, it would seem to me having two full plugs would help maintain better support of the device w/in the plug. 

3. 15A through a tap seems like a lot. Sure some of them are rated for 15A but IDK if I want to eff around and find out w/ a poorly produced wall tap. I guess the breaker offers some protection, but running a tiny device like that at capacity makes me nervous. 

So all of these outlets are in the kitchen. I'm not opposed to wring in something more logical...but if there are GFCI taps you'd recommend....I'm all ears. ",1,1736606937.0,AskElectricians,1,1.0,False

I will admit, i am different from most folks here.

I do not use tivimate, probalby never will.

I do not have a shield or own box.

I don't care about epg at all.

I dont care about video on demand movies, tv shows or 24/7 channels.

I use IPTV on my computer. I rarely watch anything live.

I mostly record or tape stuff. Mostly US football and hockey, sometimes some music.

I use Progdvd to record stuff on the computer. I can record up to 9 things at once.

I have nothing against tivimate but i just like the setup that i use. I am a big proponent of taping as much as you can and customizing your viewing experience. I like being able to not watch commercials or fast forwarding to a game that is a blowout.

Last night for example, i taped the following 6 events.

ohio state texas sky sports nfl

indy fuel wheeling ECHL hockey Flo Hockey

blackhawks red wings fanduel detroit (i watch these mostly from the RSN themselves or espn plus. I rarely use the NHL Category since i like to control the feed i watch)

minnesota ohio state college hockey big 10 plus

maine umaass lowell college hockey espn plus

arizona state north dakota college hockey cbs sports network

Then i watch at my convenience, skipping all commercials.

It is pretty to find out what sporting event is playing on what channel.

Liv[e Sports on TV Today](https://www.livesportsontv.com/)

I use the above link for NA sports. I use the sky sports nfl listings to check for what they are showing each week. Same for TSN and SPortsnet.

for streaming, i use the below links:

espn plus and flo hockey i get epg on so those are pretty easy. used to for peacock but dont anymore.

So once i confirm an event is on a channel, i just record it.

I also like the ability to pick and choose the channels i want in a service and not have somebody pick it for me.

I have a private service currently charging 80 gbd every six months for raw uk channels.

They are all in the trek service which charges 35 bucks a year. so more savings there.

Except for eagle, i have the playlists in IPTV editor and edit out categories i dont want. I pretty much keep the us, canada and uk channels and whittle out stuff i dont watch like soccer and basketball. Like i said earlier, epg is ok but i don't sweat it if it doesnt work.

I also keep some channels that show hockey. Sweden has a ton of them. finland has some also. I watched a 4 ot playoff game from russia on the khl channel last year.

Sometimes i record the Stringray Iconcerts channel overnight and watch if any good concerts are picked up.

I don't watch any entertainment live since I use the read debrid Streamio option for all non  sports. I watched the challenge final and the beast games last night. I also have the jerry springer netflix documentary set to go when i have time. I plan on binge watching all 50 seasons of Saturday night live since it is the 50th season. I am halfway through season 1. These are the uncut versions, not what Peacock edited and is on most plex services.

The point here is, dont be afraid to make these services something that works for you. not the person who sells it to you. They are marketed to the mainstream, not something unique like everybody here.  You really can have it all if you are willing to do a little work.

So instead of asking what you should use or wants links to private services, take a 24 hour trial. better, take a month trial. it is cheaper than a coffee.

I have 2 eagle 4k  subs, one trex and one strong 8k. Will add more as my private subscriptions expire.

Upon ordering, I'm informed that there is a $2 surcharge for eating here, I decline this and say ""Takeaway is fine"".

I return to the table, the coffee has arrived, and my wife has ordered some food as well. She ordered an egg salad sandwich. I tell her about the silly $2 surcharge on a $3 croissant.

I put my croissant in my jacket pocket to eat later as we walk to the next shop. When her egg salad sandwich arrives, I can tell she doesn't want to eat alone, so I take out the croissant and eat with her.

Then she goes quite... Doesn't say another word till we leave.

Outside, she proceeds to tell me how upset she is by what I ordered and should have paid the extra. This is obviously a bit of a surprise to me. Instead of escalating things, we both decide it is best to go separate ways and she decides to go home.

1hyx887,https://www.reddit.com/r/surrendered_wife/comments/1hyx887/i_totally_lost_it/,I totally lost it ,"It's my day off. I woke up around noon (which H hates). My MIL's birthday is tonight, we have a good and close relationship. I'd had some coffee, and asked my husband if he'd given thought to his mother's birthday present.

Last October he had the idea of pre-planning gifts a year in advance, and bought Christmas presents early, along with birthday presents. I gave some suggestions but he wasn't interested in my feedback. He wrapped a few in, and kept them in the storage room downstairs.

When Christmas came, a lot of them needed to be re-wrapped, because they'd gotten dusty and I wanted to do a theme, so I did that, bought extra gifts, wrote all the cards and spent a whole day making sure it looked good and I was happy with it. I asked him if it was okay, he said yes. We then drove it all out. I thought it had been a team effort and that we'd collaborated.

I ended up doubling a few Christmas presents that I didn't feel were personal enough. So I used 3 pre-bought birthday presents, told my husband, he didn't comment, and gave them alongside the Christmas presents.

I asked my husband about his mother's gift. I knew we'd talked about taking them out to dinner. I was wondering about the card.

He got irritated immediately, and then went into how, he'd tried last year, but I'd basically ruined it by giving the presents away at Christmas, and that now I wanted him to solve this for me, but that he'd done his bit and I should figure this out myself.

I was so hurt and taken aback. I got upset. I asked why he hadn't said anything at Christmas. He said it wasn't a big deal and that he didn't want to ruin Christmas. That we didn't need to talk about it.

I said I was hurt that he responded so rudely. He dismissed that. He said I was spoiled, not used to being told no, couldn't handle being told no, and that I was expecting him to ""do everything"".

I got very angry. I said he was passive aggressive. That he was being mean. Couldn't he see that?

He got upset too.

He I was always on my moral high horse, criticizing and judging him. Why was I allowed to get so angry and blow up? Shouldn't I mind my tone and speak politely?

I asked him if I was the only one that needed to be polite in this marriage?

Why couldn't he have asked me to write the card for his mother nicely?

He said I was completely overreacting, that I was unstable, unhinged, it wasn't a big deal, he wasn't passive aggressive. He said that I didn't like him telling me no, that was the issue, not how rude and cold he was.

We didn't get anywhere. I find this so deeply unfair. I appreciated his efforts, but these presents were from both of us and he didn't ask me for my input, he just wanted me to wrap and write cards as directed. Because I didn't do it exactly as he wanted, he feels it is okay to punish me out of nowhere.

I've never refused to help him with anything in our marriage. I also do not, blow up or get angry frequently, except when he says hurtful things to me, is dismissive or puts me down.

The issue always becomes my temper and never anything hurtful he did. I know I should have DT'd and IHY and expressed appreciation for his efforts. I clearly should have just let him do it, and surrendered, because he is full of resentment.

He thinks that being cold/blunt/rational cannot also be hurtful. But me getting angry is always harmful and I do it to make him feel bad. If I express being hurt, that is always an attack on him.

Hi everyone. My wife and I got a breville barista express impress for Christmas, and so far we have absolutely loved it!

Up until we got this, I honestly had no idea how much went into a shot of espresso, but I absolutely love learning and playing around with our machine. However, I feel like we could definitely do better dialing it in. 

We have used it for a few weeks and had it set to 13 grind size with medium roast beans and it seemed to be just about right. It would yield 18 grams of beans with about a 40 gram shot in around 30-35 second. So just over 2 to 1. 

However, I saw a tik tok that mentioned the portafter on the brevilles can get gross due to the plastic piece underneath accumulating residue. So I followed this tik tok and removed the plastic piece. It broke, so I really can‚Äôt put it back now. But ever since we did this the flavor has just been off? Hard to describe how, but it just isn‚Äôt the same and definitely not as good. We first thought maybe the beans were going bad, so we bought more of the exact same bean from our local coffee shop but the problem persists.

Also, if I try a grind size any smaller than around 12, we get almost zero yield. Literally drops. But anything larger than a 14 results in a mushy puck. 

We enjoy experimenting to a degree, but we also love the convenience of the breville and ultimately want to be able to wake up each morning, pull a few double shots for our drinks without having to pull out the whole kitchen, and hit the road.",1,1736606079.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I had two simple partial seizures this morning and the feeling of being a bit sickly just won't seem to lift. Found myself putting hand wash on my toothbrush instead of toothpaste. I made a coffee and it tasted absolutely nothing like coffee. Threw it away, washed mug, and remade it. Still tastes nothing like coffee.

After a minute, I could read again.

1hywyn0,https://i.redd.it/5d815jbwjdce1.jpeg,Cracked cylinder head update,"This is an update to my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/CX5/s/WU6ecQK3kc

TLDR: Mazda has agreed to cover the repair of my 2018 CX5 Grand touring 28,000 miles with the dreaded cracked cylinder head.

I called Mazda Customer Care the day after I was at the dealer. The individual took my information as I calmly explained I was aware of the scope of these problems and that I hoped Mazda would stand behind their product. The person told me my ticket would move on to the supervisory level and I could expect to receive a call within 24-48 hours.

Almost exactly 48 hours later, I did receive the call. The supervisor went through many of the same questions as the original rep, but also asked for the dealership information and contact. I was put on hold while they contacted the dealership to get information needed from them. This took about 15 minutes.

Sup. came back on and explained this would need to move to the next level to get a decision and that if I would give them 3-5 business days, they should be able to get back to me with the decision, but to allow some leeway due to the holidays (we were now a couple of days before Christmas).

I received a call on January 2nd and the same sup. congratulated me on being approved for Customer Care support for this repair. Yay!!! I was so happy to hear this, because, NGL, a nearly 7k repair bill was going to hurt.  They said my next step would be to contact the dealership for ‚Äúpayment and repair‚Äù arrangements. Which I was confused by, because they didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been approved for X amount of assistance.‚Äù But I said thank you very much and I called the dealership on the 2nd and left a message. Didn‚Äôt hear back and called again on the 3rd and texted (the dealership service manager had given me a text number to also use.) still didn‚Äôt hear anything back and was starting to wonder if the dealership was screwing with me!

Sulked over the weekend (ha ha) and on Monday, was going to call the dealership general manager if I didn‚Äôt hear back from the service manager by noon, but fortunately, the service manager called me around 10am. Apologized and said they had been having surgery the prior week (well didn‚Äôt I feel like a dick!) and then said congratulations, they have you approved. Dealership svc mgr also didn‚Äôt say anything about any repair amounts. But also told me they did not have any loaner vehicles available at the moment, but that they would call me as soon as one came back in. 

I thought it somewhat strange that they wouldn‚Äôt have a better idea of when a loaner vehicle would be returned, but they said they would update me on Tuesday, so I said thank you and waited to hear. Tuesday came - no update. Wednesday came - no update. So I called again and left a message and also texted on Thursday. Manager got back via text and said no loaners had come back but the whole service department knows that the next one to get returned goes to you. Just getting frustrated at this point because I don‚Äôt feel that I can safely drive my car anywhere too far. 

Move to Friday, and by now I am convinced I am not getting to take my car for repairs until sometime the following week when the phone rings around 2pm. The manager tells me they have a loaner in and if I can be there by 4:30 today, we can set up the paperwork. Otherwise I can come Saturday. There is snow forecasted to be falling all day Saturday so I told the manager I would be there by 4:30. (The dealership is about 45 minutes away). 

I get to the dealership and they ask if I have removed all my personal belongings from the car (I had done so back in December when all of this started!) They needed my DL, my insurance card, and a credit card (‚Äúfor a $5 hold for the rental car, but don‚Äôt worry, you won‚Äôt be charged for the rental.‚Äù) Had me head over to the waiting room where I had a cup of coffee while they got all the paperwork together. Manager come to get me, has me sign off on all the paperwork, no one says anything about any amounts, so I am finally confident that Mazda is covering the 7k repair in full. (Can you tell I have been super anxious through this entire thing?) ha ha.

I then was shown to a 2024 Mazda CX30 (the other option was a CX90 - too big!!) and told to be sure to return it with the same amount of gas and that I would get a message from the manager when they begin work on my car sometime next week, and that it would take 1-2 weeks to complete, but to not worry because now I had a safe car to drive in the meantime. 

So that is where we sit at this time. I hope my detailed experience will help anyone else going through this. My big takeaway in dealing with Mazda was to not be emotional or angry, to explain why you think they should be taking care of you, and be polite with the people on the phone who are just doing their jobs.  I think that goes a long way.

When repairs finally are complete, I will post one more final update. If you‚Äôve read this far, congratulations! And thanks!",12,1736605548.0,CX5,11,1.0,False

1hywx8r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hywx8r,I would love your ideas please. I'm going a little crazy with all this!,"**What it is:**

It's a 2 bed flat, very dark all year round and an odd shape. It also has a cold concrete floor which gets freezing in winter. Condensation is a huge thing in these flats and I need my dehumidifier on almost 24/7. I can't afford the bathroom yet, and it'll be last to do. It's only me (m, 31) living there.

**Done so far:**

Gutted it all out, rectified rising damp and I've installed my kitchen (last photo) with gloss white units, warm light grey wood countertops and the walls are done in pebble shore (Dulux) and brilliant white for the ceiling. The rest of the flat is a blank canvas.

**My thoughts on what to do:**

Floor, I'm thinking do the entire flat in a light wood colour, but not white or grey herringbone laminate floor (I can't afford wood) with area carpets for warmth. I couldn't and still can't afford underfloor heating and it's too late now.
Thinking of carpet for all the rooms - it's cheaper - but I'm used to living with hard flooring, and I'm concerned about condensation making the carpet damp and smelly?

Colours, I LOVE 3 colour palettes, and love them equally...

1 option, and probably the most realistic with how dark it is, and it's not my forever home, would be white walls/ceiling with splashes of black and primary/secondary colour in the furniture/other furnishings. Timeless with a pop.

2nd would be the family of greiges, carbons and anthracites. Think broody but warm, post-industrial, masculine but not overly so - I'm not out to prove myself like you see in some bare-brick walled apartments with Edison bulbs everywhere, but I do just like the tone and must confess, I am a hipster; I love jazz, photography, coffee and bonsai trees

3rd would be a much lighter form... To summarise, Japandi. Beige, cream, mushroom, maybe milky coffee. Smooth and relaxing, but I wouldn't want it looking like an apartment of skin or a restaurant if that makes sense.

Can these styles be blended at all?

** Finally, your say!**

Lastly, rather than all that, what would you say? I'm an creative, with photography as being my full time job (up until recently) and formal education in oil painting and art history so I'm completely prepared for a bold option. Ideally no wallpaper only because I've worked hard on these walls, but again, I'm ready for compromises - if you say a feature wall ofa  big bold patterned wallpaper (but more particular) I'll consider it.

I had many so called friends but, had some silly arguments with my so-called friends last semester, I‚Äôm okay with a small circle.

One girl in my group, let‚Äôs call her R, is pretty cheesy and notoriously stingy. Whenever we go to the canteen, she suggests the expensive items but never pays. If we ask her to cover something small, like a cup of tea, she always claims she doesn‚Äôt have money, yet she never hesitates to order a cold coffee, worth rs 50 for herself which later we had to pay.

I don‚Äôt mind paying for her sometimes, but she should pay occasionally as well.

Never mind, she is also the kind of girl who irritates me a lot. I get very frustrated because of her.

Two days ago, a group of us, including R, went to the flower show. We had a great time, and R was really excited about the trip. However, after walking for just five minutes, she began to complain. She said things like, ""I don't think I can go on anymore; I'm so tired. My head hurts. I just don't have the energy. Can you book a cab for me? My phone has no charge,"" and so on.

But she was the one who suggested we plan the trip in the first place. Yet, she started acting as if she were an elderly person who couldn't walk. She is fat, has an ugly face, lots of pimple marks and white pimples, black heads and all. Yet she makes fun of my guy-friends who is literally 100X better then her in every term. Not only that, she makes so vulgar face expression in class or even when we eat. like sticking out tongue while eating, Wearing too much clevage showing tight tops or crop tops even when she has soooo bad stretch marks all over her body. I told her many times to wear proper clothes in class as this kinda clothes are not even comfortable to wear, neither does it suits on her body. 

The main thing is that day we ordered some kulfis. When I asked her if she wanted to have kulfi, she shouted, ‚ÄúChup kar, l\*di! Dikhta nahi, sardi hui hai mujhe!‚Äù She said this loudly in public, which really frustrated me. I calmly responded, ‚ÄúR, tameez se baat kar le. Dobara gaali di to muh mein kulfi maar dungi.‚Äù My other male friends then told me that I shouldn‚Äôt have included her in the trip, and I think they might be right.

I already have anger issue a lot, I still manage to make everything calm with her. But she is so irritating. 

I felt it was best not to end our friendship, as I only have two close friends who are girls. If I choose to break things off with her, it could lead to the end of our group.

5. ""I remember when using a pay phone cost a dime. My dad gave me a dime to call my mom at home before we left the store, and I had to walk back to him and ask for a nickel because the price had gone up to fifteen cents.""
6. ""I remember that in order to change the channel on the TV, you did it by hand and then sat back down. Additionally, all television programming was done at 11:30 p.m., and then the national anthem. Good times.""
7. ""A lighter and ashtrays in the car. Starting in elementary school, clay art projects and nearly every kid made their parents an ashtray. We had a lot of ashtrays!""
8. ""I once explained to my 7th graders that when I was a kid, if I missed a favorite TV show, I‚Äôd have to wait until the summer reruns to see it. One of the boys raised his hand and asked, 'Why didn‚Äôt you just watch it on streaming?'""
9. ""Eating in a restaurant full of smoke. People would light up for their after-dinner smoke and coffee. Tables had ashtrays with the name of the restaurant on them. People could buy them to use at home as souvenirs.""
10. ""Being super excited to thumb through the newspaper so you could see which movies were playing in the theaters that weekend and what the showtimes were. And there were WAY fewer new movies that came out, but almost every one that did was worth seeing. You can‚Äôt even keep up with all the movies they release now, and most of them are crapfests.""
11. ""Comic books you could buy at the five-and-dime that were 12 cents.""
12. ""Looking forward to Friday nights because it was Blockbuster night! Drive out, get a movie or two, maybe a video game, and candy. Hope you got there and the new release still had copies available. Make a special trip out on Sundays to return it. It was mind-blowing when they started to carry DVDs. Good memories.""
13. ""Going to eat somewhere and putting some money in a jukebox to hear songs, which meant everybody there got to hear your choices. Fancier places had devices at each booth that let you select songs without having to wait in line at the jukebox.""
14. ""My high school offered a bowling class. It was a P.E. credit and held at a nearby bowling alley. Since bowling alleys are notorious for being smoky, our teacher didn't care if we smoked during that class. We also learned how to score bowling on paper, and that's literally the only time I've ever used paper scoring for bowling because it was the late '90s and electronic scores were already implemented everywhere.""
15. ""I remember going to the drive-in theater, and two of us would hide in the trunk and two of us would climb on top of our station wagon. I remember falling asleep with my girlfriend on top of the car during the late feature after a necking session. Great fun!!""

I encourage you all to please take yourself out. Go to that bar alone, to that restaurant, museum, movie,‚Ä¶ you will see that you are not alone and enjoy it. It will boost your confidence, take your mind of things.

Confidence is the most attractive thing in a human being. So if you are still in the phase that I am (27F 3 weeks post breakup) some days this might be easy, others extremely difficult but treat yourself like the love of your life. Because if you know how to love yourself, you will not settle for less.

1hywoxz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hywoxz,A moody Saturday morning in our converted townhouse ,"Collected, curated, and slowly decorated - this is our post-holiday living/dining space. This building is a former 1920‚Äôs middle school that was converted into condos in 2010. Our unit was once the auditorium and features fabulous detailing where the stage used to be. It wraps around the entire wall and was a big factor in our decision to purchase. 

Please disregard my messy studio corner (@calcookceramics on instagram if lumpy ceramics are your thing) and yes, I am watching an animal crossing island build while I sip my morning coffee. Enjoy your weekend, fellow maximalists!",251,1736604716.0,maximalism,12,1.0,False
