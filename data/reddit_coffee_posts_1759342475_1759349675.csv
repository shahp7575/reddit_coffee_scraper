I like science and I feel sad that I can't find anyone else in science, specially other women, so I figured I start a monthly / bi weekly meetup called ""Women In STEM"" for coffee and just nerdy chit-chats.

  
any idea how I can start? are there any spaces you recommend that I could book/reserve?

I was thinking of starting them at some cafe but that'd probably need reservation or some sort of fee. There's the mall but it's a crowded and loud place to hangout at. ",1,1759349387.0,askvan,1,1.0,False

I was always the ‘I like a little coffee with my chocolate and peppermint’ kinda gal, so my go to was always stbx peppermint mocha. 

I’ve been doing heavy cream with a little monkfruit, a little swerve, and some cocoa powder and it’s been OK but not amazing. If I’m not making into a Frappuccino I always froth the cream together with the sweetener and cocoa before adding my coffee, the same way I always did when I used sugary chocolate sauce and coffee mate creamer before keto. 

I just got the mocha and the vanilla syrups from Jordan’s Skinny Syrups (cause stbx puts both mocha and vanilla in their mochas) so I could try to replicate. They seemed like lots of folks recommended. And boy did I F up that first attempt. 

I added 4 pumps of mocha and 2 pumps of vanilla to the creamer, frothed it, and then poured in my cold brew. And I stg this thing looked like I’d just dropped the shot into an Irish Car Bomb! The cream looked like it might be curdling on the top. I could see waves like settling down towards the bottom of the cup. Legit it behaved and tasted just like an Irish Car Bomb. 

So yeah. Probably because of the sugar alcohols and I also probably added way too much of the syrup, it was waaaay too sweet. Dumped that whole glass cause I’m not trying to reminisce about St. Patty’s day in my 20’s, just get an after lunchie pick me up. 

So I did a smaller test with just 2 pumps of mocha, put it in my cold brew first, and then added some cream (unfrothed). It doesn’t look like it’s curdling, but it still tastes like a car bomb and not really getting any of the chocolate taste.

So please help me find my mocha fix! 

People who use Jordan’s skinny sauces- what’s the ‘right’ ratio to get the yummy flavor without the booze taste? 

People who like stbx- what sf sauces do you use to replicate a mocha or peppermint mocha flavor? 

Are there good sf coffee flavor options out there that don’t go bad quickly or have that alcohol boozy taste? 

I might just need to give these Jordan’s away because bleh I am not a fan so far. 

Thank you!

Lets skip back to Wednesday last week, the moment i walked in put my bags in the office and went for coffee, she walked up to me and presented herself (at that point we had never met, but she apperently had seen me before.. ) we did not had and chance for small talk cause of the celebration of word Alzheimer day, but later that day she did brought cake, and smiled see you next week at the party.. 

So yesterday at the party i was sitting at a large crowded table with many volunteers and than she came in, smiled and waved at me and was really happy to see me i think. 

Later that evening i was sitting at the teamleaders table when she brought op to drive me home with her car, and i said yes with a pokerface, (in my daydreaming thoughts i hoped that she would asked that) 

In the car drive back home we talked about, life, career, her horse riding hobby, and that she worked in the past as a physiotherapist, she also mentioned she has a husband. and from what i know 2 kids, in their late 20's 

Since she works on different days that i do, and we mostly don't share the same office location i just wonder, if she's into me, in a way i feel flatterd cause i think she just sees me for who iam, on the other hand i just hope she's not playing games.

1nviynh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1nviynh/tales_of_a_hotel_actech_part_one_knockers/,Tales of a Hotel AC-Tech -Part one- Knockers:,"Hey, my name’s Robert, and I work as a refrigeration tech for a facility service provider here in Europe.

    I’ve had social media since what you folks in the States might call middle school, but this is actually the first time I’m posting anything like this. I’ve been reading your stories, strange encounters, things that don’t quite fit and I guess I’m here looking for advice. Or maybe I just need to say these things out loud to someone who won’t immediately write me off as crazy. See, my company operates across Europe. We handle everything, industrial complexes, shopping malls, restaurants, even private homes. But my crew, just five of us, specializes in hotels. And some of those hotels have cellars. Deep ones. Older than the buildings above. Sometimes we’re crawling through forgotten tunnels, machine rooms no one’s touched in decades, or winding stone corridors that don’t show up on any plan. 
    And sometimes, in those places, I get the very real sense… that I’m not alone.
    
    Alright, maybe I should lay out the bigger picture. I live in one of those massive old European cities, but I commute to a different one for work. And while America’s got the size, Europe’s got the centuries. No offense, but when your idea of an “old building” is from the 1800s, I have to chuckle, I pass a literal medieval castle on my walk to the supermarket. The city I work in is packed with hotels, some sleek and modern, others creaking with history. And they all have one thing in common: cellars. Some are tidy concrete slabs lit by sterile neon, others are damp stone caverns with arched masonry and single dangling 60-watt bulbs that barely light the ground in front of you, if you can even stand upright. And yeah, crawling isn’t off the table, either. The thing is, those deep, cold spaces are great for keeping AC units and ventilation systems from overheating, at least in theory. But sometimes the architects overestimate what these underground chambers can handle. Or they just toss an ancient oil boiler in there and hope for the best. You end up sweating in a sweltering crawlspace, wedged between corroded pipework and mystery puddles, trying to keep your gear from shorting out. And it’s not just physically rough. These places are lonely. No cell reception, no GPS, no easy way to call for help if something goes wrong. One wrong step, one bad fall, one faulty headlamp... and you're alone in the dark, soaked in water and oil, listening to the hum of machines and the dripping of old pipes. Sometimes, it’s hard to shake the feeling that something’s watching.
    
    Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not some wide-eyed rookie. Sure, my crew still calls me “the new guy” because I’ve only been around for six years, but that says more about how long everyone else has been doing this than it does about me. I'm not “getting old” yet, but maybe spending too much time alone underground and scrolling through the same twelve stale memes Facebook manages to load without a connection is finally wearing me down. Because I swear, something is off about those cellars. It’s more than just old architecture. Some of these corridors twist and turn in ways that don’t make sense. You’ll swear a tunnel was shorter the last time you walked it. You’ll find a set of stairs that dives into the dark, count the steps, then count again on the way back and get a different number. There are drops that go way deeper than they should, little stairwells tucked behind steel doors that weren’t there yesterday. Some buildings even share their cellars huge, sprawling sub-levels that connect across property lines like they belong to one massive labyrinth. Breakthroughs happen by accident during renovation. Or a corroded wall just… gives way. And suddenly, the basement you thought you knew gets a whole lot bigger. 
    The rumor? That all of it, the strange layouts, the odd overlaps, the deeper levels, is part of something larger. That beneath the city, there’s a hidden network of cellars and tunnels, some centuries old, stretching on and on like roots under a forest. And lately, I’ve started to believe it.
    
    The unease? That’s not new. It’s something I’ve grown used to over the years, just part of the job, or so I thought. But the crazy? That started recently. It was a normal day, honestly. I was on a routine check-up at one of our usual hotels. Nothing out of the ordinary. Got there early, grabbed a coffee, chatted with the janitor, nice guy, always has a story ready. Finished up some maintenance on the rooftop units. Great view of the local river from up there, by the way, shame most people never see it. Around noon, I swung by the supermarket down the block and picked up a lazy excuse for breakfast: a bag of crisps and two donuts. Yeah, yeah, I know, I should prep proper food, but living alone, the last thing I want to do after a long day is assemble sandwiches. So I figured I’d take a slightly extended break down in one of the quieter cellar rooms, just a quick recharge in a spot where no one would spot me slacking off. The room I picked was one of those half-forgotten spaces, dusty, some junk storage, a half-broken chair that looked like it had been abandoned decades ago. I left one of the donuts sitting in the bag on that chair and got back to work, figuring I’d return and reward myself with some deep-fried sugar. When I came back? The donut was gone. Now, I’d blame my coworkers in a heartbeat, except I was working solo that day. No one else had a reason to be down there, and I would’ve heard them if they had come in. It's not exactly the kind of place people sneak into without making a sound. And look, I know how dumb that sounds. “Spooky donut vanishes in creepy basement” doesn’t exactly scream high-stakes horror. But that donut wasn’t the scary part. It was the first thread I pulled, and everything that’s come after has been way harder to laugh off. Just stick with me. It only gets weirder from here.
    
    About two days after the donut incident, things got... strange. I was back at the same hotel, still doing my usual rounds, crawling between AC units and ventilation machines, half-fueled by coffee, energy drinks, and the same dozen stale memes that my phone had saved before I lost reception. It was just another long, quiet shift underground. Until I heard the knocking. At first, I brushed it off, probably just metal expanding in a ventilation shaft or a faulty bearing clicking under pressure. Happens all the time. But this noise? It repeated. And the more I heard it, the less it sounded mechanical. It was rhythmic. Sharp. 
    Almost like someone tapping a pipe with the end of a screwdriver. I didn't run off to investigate right away, I’ve seen horror movies, thanks. I know how that one ends. But after a while, I had to accept the possibility that it wasn’t something sinister, just something technical. And that’s my wheelhouse. So I followed the sound. And as soon as I stepped into the room where it seemed to be coming from, it stopped, dead quiet. The only thing in that room was a large ventilation unit. I popped the cover and, sure enough, the belt had shredded. The system had automatically shut itself down sometime earlier when it detected low airflow. I replaced the belt, ran diagnostics, no faults, no noises. 
    Just eerie silence. 
    
    It wasn’t a big fix. But it could have been. It was peak summer, heading into a long weekend. If I hadn’t caught it by pure luck, the hotel's conference wing would’ve lost climate control, and emergency service calls are never cheap. But here’s the thing. That knock? It’s happened again. And every time I follow it, I find something, some piece of equipment about to fail, or something broken that I never would’ve checked otherwise. It’s like the sound is pointing me toward problems before they blow up. So maybe it’s nothing. Coincidence. A trick of old buildings and tired ears.
    
    Another time, I was working at the airport hotel with two of my colleagues, Gregor and Thomas. Gregor handles control systems and regulation tech, and he's... well, seasoned. Oldest on the team, razor-sharp, and permanently grumpy. He’s the kind of guy who can silence a whole room with a look that says, “Try me, and you’ll regret it.” Thomas is practically his opposite, second youngest, always smiling, built like a teddy bear, and still glowing from new-dad energy. Heating and plumbing are his domain. We were swapping job stories in one of the back rooms, just killing time during a cooldown after some rooftop maintenance. You know, the usual technician banter: which hotel makes the worst coffee, which janitor keeps chocolate in their desk, whose repairs turned into total chaos. 
    Somewhere in between talk of exploding ductwork and poorly labeled breaker boxes, it slipped out, I mentioned the knocking. Didn’t mean to. I wasn’t trying to kick up ghost stories. Just kind of came out. Thomas, cheerful as ever, suddenly went quiet. He looked at me, serious, really serious, and that alone made me uneasy. Even Gregor looked up from his laptop. That death-stare of his locked right onto me, and in that moment I felt like a kid getting scolded at school. 
    ""You mean the Knockers,"" he said flatly. 
    ""I hope you left them something in return."" 
    I stared at him. ""What? Knockers?"" 
    Thomas broke the tension with an exaggerated spooky voice. “Goblin creatures that live in the shadows, OOOoouuuOooh! Haha!” 
    Then he shook his head and added, more seriously, “For real though, it's bad luck to follow the knocks.” 
    I thought they were teasing me, dry sarcasm is basically Gregor's first language. But then he leaned forward, eyes still fixed on mine, and said, 
    “They’re real. They give you warnings. But they expect something in return. Next time, leave them part of your breakfast.” 
    Before I could respond, Thomas chimed in again: “Personally? I just ignore them. I’m a brand-new dad. Bad luck’s the last thing I need. And you should probably steer clear too.” 
    We dropped it after that, and the rest of the maintenance went smooth as butter. But what they said stuck with me. Maybe they were messing with me. Maybe not. Still... ever since that day, I’ve started leaving a few snacks behind in the cellar rooms. A piece of bread. A half-eaten chocolate bar. One time, a boiled egg. They always vanish. No crumbs. No wrappers. No trace. Maybe its all bs and I'm just feeding rats.
    
    I was on emergency call when the worst of it happened. Let me set the scene. Emergency duty comes around for me about three times a year, just enough to keep you on edge but not enough to get used to it. This time it was January. Of course it was January. Heating had failed in one of our hotels late Friday afternoon, right on cue for a snowstorm and a rush-hour traffic apocalypse. I spent over an hour crawling through the blizzard just to get there. No janitor. No technician. Just a frazzled receptionist fielding guest complaints with barely veiled contempt. Rooms were freezing. People were arguing. The air inside was colder than outside, emotionally speaking. Now, heating’s not exactly my specialty, but I wasn’t about to shrug and leave. First, I checked one of the affected guest rooms. Sounds dumb, I know, but tourists are... unpredictable. More than once I’ve fixed a “broken” radiator by turning it on properly or giving it a stern whack. 
    (The radiator, not the tourist, I have some restraint.) Then I checked the pumps: flawless. Pressure was perfect on both sides. No red flags. I let myself have a five-minute coffee break. Just one moment to breathe. Then I grabbed the backroom keys and packed the tools that actually fit in my overalls, because of course the one wrench I really needed didn’t fit, and started systematically working my way through the third basement level, hoping to track down the boiler room. That’s when I heard it. The knocking. Soft at first, metal on metal. Familiar now, but still deeply wrong in that silence. Like a call. Like a reminder. It echoed through the corridors and pulled at something in my gut. At some point, I stopped my systematic search. Room by room had become hallway by hallway, and I was already losing the fight against time. It was almost the weekend, and all I wanted was to be back in my one-room rooftop apartment, dodgy heating, sure, but at least there I could bury myself in a blanket with a mug of hot chocolate and pretend I wasn’t MacGyvering an entire hotel’s heating system by flashlight. 
    
    So I gave in. I followed the knocking. It led me down a corridor that looked identical to the last four I’d passed. Same cracked tiles. Same exposed wiring. Same hum from old pipes above. But the door at the end? I’d never noticed it before. Now, maybe some of you get this. That moment when you realize you’re in too deep, but only after it’s too late. 
    Like when you're waiting for a machine to finish powering up, and suddenly thirty minutes are gone and you’re still standing there, holding a wrench and your breath. It’s never one big decision. It’s death by five-minute increments. That’s how it was. It wasn’t until the knocking, so regular, every thirty seconds, stopped that I noticed something was wrong. 
    Not just the sound. The walls. The concrete had changed. Subtly, at first, cracks turned to seams, gray turned to reddish tones. Then it was obvious. The corridor wasn’t concrete anymore. It was brick. Old brick, sealed with crumbling mortar. That kind of wrong that seeps in after you’ve been walking too long, thinking too little. I turned around, trying to retrace my steps, but the shadows seemed to soak up the beam of my flashlight. Every corner felt too familiar and not familiar enough. How many turns had I made? Had I passed that broken light already? Was it the same one… or just one of many? I found a wall where I remembered a fire escape plan being mounted. One of those emergency diagrams every basement has. Only now, it was just an empty frame. No map. No “you are here.” No help.
    Not every tunnel down there is just bare walls and flickering lights. Sometimes, it feels like walking through pieces of memory, layers of the city's forgotten workers and discarded lives. I passed graffiti scrawled across rusted panels, names, dates, a crude drawing of something with too many eyes. Empty coke bottles. Torn work gloves. 
    Some poor soul’s entire lunch history fossilized in packaging dust. One stretch looked like a technician’s lair, maybe a shop long since abandoned. Discarded motors piled up like mechanical fossils. Shelves lined with rusted tools no one had used in decades. I even passed an anvil. Don’t ask me how it got down there. I squeezed by a heavy old workbench with a vice still clamped shut around a scrap of copper pipe, and just below it… was a bedroll. Ratty blanket, foam mat, a few empty cans. Someone had lived here. Maybe still did. I was relieved the spot was empty, but it rattled me. I wasn’t just lost, I was wandering where people had survived. That meant there had to be a way in. And hopefully, a way out. Now, I know what some of you are thinking: “Just follow the pipes.” Yeah, good luck with that. Down there, the pipes travel in tangled clusters of ten or more, twisting like veins in a city-wide anatomy lesson no one bothered to label. They disappear into solid walls, pass through sealed rooms, make turns with no logic. Following them just means chasing chaos in industrial form. 
    
    So I made a call: go up. No matter where I was, if I kept going up, I’d eventually find the surface. I climbed the next staircase I found. Top step opened into three rooms. All dead ends. Trash everywhere, broken furniture, soaked insulation, rotting mop buckets. No doors. No windows. Just more silence. So I turned around and dragged myself back down. And kept walking. And then, familiarity. A stairwell I’d used before. A corridor I recognized. A corner with that same chunk of missing tile by the janitor’s closet. Except this wasn’t the hotel I’d started in. I surfaced into the lobby of a completely different hotel. One I hadn’t visited in at least eight months. Somewhere, through all those turns and passageways, I’d crossed through the city, underground. The rest was pure irritation. 
    I had to walk an hour and a half back through the snow, in the middle of the night, just to return to the right building. Went straight to the third sublevel, found the boiler, and sure enough, just a blown 6V breaker in the control line. A two-minute fix. Heat came back like nothing happened. And when the sun rose Saturday morning… I was home. 
    Exhausted. Confused. And with a story I knew no one would believe.

1nvixck,https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1nvixck/old_sp_hit_me_up_trouble_with_new_sp/,Old SP hit me up + trouble with new SP,"**TL;DR: Heard from old SP after 4 months NC, he's been living in a hotel until now, I'm not being the one to initiate meeting up, my new SP didn't contact me after our first sleepover until I contacted him & am communicating my expectations now, he seems emotionally very childish/oblivious, I don't think it's a good sign when you are trying to manifest better behavior in the early talking stage, but it's great in real life, I just want to see better adult interpersonal skills.**

Well, well, well... my old SP (the one who left me on delivered for months) has responded. Ironically, it's when I've been sleeping with a new man. Maybe they really do feel the energy shift, or maybe it happened that way since I started telling myself I won't be shocked if he comes back in once I'm focused on other things. Old SP said he's been living in a hotel for months, got a new job, now finally moving into a new place soon. Who knows if this is the truth but I'm just casually replying. I also am gonna tell him to let me know when the timing is right to meet for coffee, as I'm not being the initiator making plans so he doesn't agree then cancel.

My new SP, this past weekend I stayed the night & was there for 24 hours. It was our first overnight, been seeing eachother about a month. Unfortunately there's some trouble now. Our sleepover went great, super intimate, super romantic, had a nice date (dinner & mini golf) before having a lovely night at the house, he cooked breakfast & served it to me in bed! 

However, in the 3 days since... no contact!

When he was telling me bye, I told him to think about a concert coming up next week if he wants to go altho it's a weeknight, & he said he'll text me.

He didn't even send me anything the next day! Previously, I've been almost 100% the pursuer, which I DO NOT like, as that was kinda a pattern with previous SP. I would've had no problem sending something sweet the next day, as I previously had been doing that, but this time I wanted to see if he'll reach out, as I personally think that is common human respect after intimacy, and I feel like an emotionally intelligent man would know that is part of aftercare for a woman as we are feeling vulnerable after we let him INSIDE our body. 

But today (3 days later) I went ahead & asked ""I'm guessing you aren't the type to say something nice the next day 😭""

He instantly replied with ""Not really sorry 😂 i don't usually message people first unless i get messaged because like i said i keep to myself a lot 😂

My initial reaction was kinda 🤢 what a man-child response, including the laugh emojis making it feel disrespectful.

He also has been single for 4 years, and no sex in 2 years. Literally, our intimacy was the first time he's touched a woman in 2 years.. and yet he couldn't take 7 seconds to type a nice message the next day?? Even if it starts as casual (I don't want commitment before sex, not my style, I'd rather do what I want & let him dip if that's how he is) the same adult courtesy applies.

I know he likes me, and we've had great experiences and lots of affection. I do think all clues are indicating extreme avoidance & emotional immaturity/no idea how to treat a woman emotionally. Also his only longterm relationship ended because she felt like they were just roommates (literally classic complaint about how a relationship feels with a dismissive avoidant). 

So.. I did message him back letting him know that this isn't criticism, but this is why he's been single for 2 years & I want to inform that sending a message the next day is part of aftercare, otherwise we assume we've been ghosted & women generally don't want to be the initiator after sex etc. 

I'm not trying to be Barbara Builder, as being in my early 30s I have no interest in training a man in the basics regarding how to communicate with a woman and emotional intimacy

To not play games, I also clearly communicated that I don't want to initiate 100% of the time & it makes me feel cared for & special if he texts me first + asks me to hangout/plans dates. I believe in communication, not sitting there in silence like lots of modern dating advice says.

I just kinda thought I'd get some more enthusiasm given he hasn't had sex in 2 years 😂

I went from being a pretty active dad in my 40s to being almost completely sedentary. And in that time, I gained 30 pounds and atrophied everywhere.

Beyond the numbers on the scale, I just felt... weak. I was exhausted, my muscles ached, and I fell into the trap of thinking I had to starve myself to lose the weight, which only made me feel more frail. 

My biggest lesson after months of experimenting with fasting and dieting was to **stop skipping breakfast and start my day with protein.** No more grabbing a quick coffee and running on empty. I made a conscious choice to have a couple of eggs or a bowl of Greek yogurt.

It wasn't a magic bullet, but it was the first domino. It stabilized my energy, helped me start replacing the muslce mass I'd lost, cut down on cravings later in the day, and for the first time, it felt like I was being *intentional* about my recovery.

It made me realize how many of us are just guessing our way through nutrition, especially after a setback.

**So, my question for you is: What was the one small, intentional change you made with your nutrition that created the biggest positive ripple effect in your life after your blood clots?**",1,1759349097.0,ClotSurvivors,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1
I peeled off my latex gloves with a satisfying snap and tossed them into the biohazard bin. Thirty-six hours on my feet, four cardiac arrests, one multi-car pileup, and a toddler who'd swallowed his mother's wedding ring. Just another marathon shift at San Francisco General.
""You're still standing. Impressive,"" Dr. Ramirez said, passing me in the hallway.
I managed a tired smile. ""Barely.""
But exhaustion couldn't touch the flutter of excitement in my chest. I pulled out my phone and texted Marcus:
*Still on for City Hall at 2? Can't wait to make this official! ❤️*
His response came quickly: *Wouldn't miss it. See you soon, beautiful.*
Five years together, and his messages still made me smile. I stared at the three dots that appeared, then disappeared without another text following. Probably just got distracted with work. Marcus was always juggling a dozen things at once—the curse of being a tech entrepreneur in San Francisco.
I gathered my things from my locker, changing from scrubs into a simple navy dress I'd brought specially for our appointment. The marriage license was just paperwork, but it felt momentous—the first official step toward becoming Dr. Natalie Sterling.
""There's the blushing bride!"" Sarah's voice rang out as I entered the staff lounge. My best friend and fellow ER physician was pouring herself coffee, dark circles under her eyes matching mine.
""Not a bride yet,"" I corrected, but couldn't help the smile spreading across my face.
""Let me see that rock again,"" Sarah demanded, grabbing my left hand. The emerald-cut diamond caught the fluorescent light. ""God, Marcus has good taste. One month to go, huh?""
""Twenty-nine days,"" I corrected, accepting the coffee she offered. ""But who's counting?""
""Everyone is,"" Dr. Chen, a passing nurse chimed in with a wink. ""Hospital's favorite love story. The doctor who healed the broken bad boy.""
I rolled my eyes but couldn't suppress my smile. It wasn't far from the truth. Marcus had come into my ER five years ago after a motorcycle accident—reckless driving after a brutal breakup, I'd later learn. I'd put twelve stitches in his forehead while he'd flirted through his concussion. Three days later, flowers arrived at the nurses' station with a note asking me to dinner.
""I still can't believe you're marrying a guy who crashed his bike because his girlfriend dumped him,"" Sarah teased.
""Ex-girlfriend,"" I corrected. ""Ancient history.""
Sarah raised an eyebrow. ""Victoria Hayes, right? Wasn't she some marketing executive or something?""
""Something like that,"" I murmured, the name sending an inexplicable chill through me. Marcus rarely spoke about Victoria, but when he did, there was always something in his voice—a tension that made me change the subject.
""Well, he traded up,"" Sarah declared, squeezing my shoulder. ""You saved his life, Nat. Literally and figuratively.""
I checked my watch. ""I should get going. Don't want to be late.""
The hospital lobby was crowded with the usual afternoon chaos—visitors, discharged patients, staff changing shifts. I was halfway across when I spotted him through the glass doors. Marcus, in his tailored navy suit that matched my dress perfectly without planning. My heart did that familiar little skip.
I raised my hand to wave, then froze.
He wasn't alone.
A woman stood before him, her back to me. Tall, slender, with glossy dark hair cascading down her back. Her hand rested on his forearm with casual intimacy. Something about her posture—confident, possessive—made me instinctively step behind a structural column.
""One month, Marcus,"" her voice carried across the lobby. Rich, slightly husky. ""One month before you're chained to Dr. Boring for life.""
I should have revealed myself then. Should have walked up, introduced myself, laughed it off. Instead, I stayed hidden, heart hammering against my ribs.
""Victoria..."" Marcus's voice held a warning, but also something else. Something that made my stomach twist.
""A countdown romance,"" she continued, stepping closer to him. ""Thirty days to remember what we had. What we could still have.""
I waited for him to step back. To laugh. To tell her he was happy now.
Instead, after a pause that stretched like an eternity, he whispered:
""Okay.""

Day 1: landed early into MCO, grabbed lunch and went to hotel. Freshened up and got coffee and went to MNSSHP around 4 PM. It was super crowded at the entrance but line moved fast. 

Although we got in around 4, I think the trick or treating didn’t start til 7 and the special Halloween food didn’t start til 7 either. We had some cheeseburger spring rolls that were really good and some truffle fries but otherwise I didn’t have any memorable food or I just missed the options. Food lines were also semi long so I didn’t get on it unless I was rly hungry or rly wanted to try something. 

It showed rain but it was on and off. It was sunny and humid most of the time and then it would pour for an hour and then drop. Definitely pack the poncho or light rain jacket/shoes. 

The haunted mansion was cute but not my favorite ride. Wait times for most rides were around 30 mins or so. But the trick or treat lines were also so long, I just gave up after one area so I didn’t get much candy. It’s also just regular mini Twix/snickers/m&m so didn’t go crazy. 

The hocus pocus show was nice followed by special Halloween fireworks and the Halloween parade. But by 12am I was so done for the day and my feet too so I just left halfway into the parade 

I did like the special events and the vibes but I don’t know if I would go again for the Halloween party at the price I paid. 

Day2: 
Hollywood studios - moderately
Crowded but fun. The Mickey railroad ride was my favorite! (I only do baby rides)Star Wars area was also really cool. Food was okay, we ate at ABC commissary. Again got rained out for half the day so didn’t get to see the Indiana jones show but that would have been nice.

Day3. Epcot 
Got here around 12pm and did a few rides and walked around for the food festival. The food was hit or miss. The Brazilian breads, the French short ribs, Mexican flan, empanadas were good. But the fried cheese thing at Greece was terrible. The lamb kabab at Morocco was also good. Got too full and didn’t get to try anything from Japan or china :( left around 7pm for flight back home.

This is not medical advice - it's just my personal experience that I'm sharing in hopes it might help others. Please consult with healthcare professionals before trying any supplements or treatments.**

I'm writing this because five years ago, I would have given anything to read something like this.

I was the kid who moved schools constantly. Always the outsider, always alone. I thought I was just independent. Then puberty hit during another move to a new high school, and something changed.

The first panic attack happened during a school assembly. My heart was pounding so hard I was convinced everyone could hear it. My chest locked up, I couldn't breathe, and my brain was screaming that everyone was watching me fall apart. The more I worried about people noticing, the worse it got.

I kept telling myself it would pass. It didn't.

For two years, I didn't leave a one-mile radius. School, then straight home to hide in my room. Every presentation was torture. Getting called on in class made my hands shake. I loved biology and wanted to become a doctor, but I realized that career required constant social interaction and presentations. How could I help others when I couldn't even speak up in a classroom?

I switched to software development. At least computers don't judge you.

By year 12, I couldn't take it anymore. I finally told my parents, expecting help. They laughed. They told me I was being ridiculous, that I was ""crazy."" That's when I learned I could only depend on myself.

I wanted professional help, but the thought of calling a doctor's office or sitting in a waiting room filled with strangers felt impossible. So I just accepted it. This was my life now.

Everything changed at university when I finally had some money of my own. I made a decision: this is where I end my suffering. I wasn't going to let anxiety control my life anymore.

I became obsessed. I researched every supplement, every therapy, every technique I could find. I tried everything - magnesium, ashwagandha, propranolol, 5-HTP, vitamin D3, L-theanine. Some did nothing. A few changed everything.

**What actually worked for me:**

**Propranolol** \- The first time I took 40mg before a university presentation, I couldn't believe what didn't happen. My hands didn't shake. My heart didn't race. My voice didn't crack. It blocks the physical panic symptoms without touching your mind. For the first time in years, I felt normal.

**Ashwagandha (1200mg daily)** \- After about a week, things that used to consume my thoughts just didn't matter as much. That classmate who made a snide comment? Instead of replaying it for hours, I found myself thinking ""whatever."" The presentation next week? Still nervous, but not the all-consuming dread.

**Magnesium (600mg before bed)** \- Fixed my sleep, which made everything else manageable. For years I'd lie in bed with my muscles tense, replaying every social interaction. With magnesium, my body actually relaxed.

**L-theanine (200mg before coffee)** \- Let me have coffee again. For two years I'd given it up because the jitters would trigger panic attacks. This amino acid removes the anxiety while keeping the focus. Getting my morning routine back felt like reclaiming a piece of myself.

The recovery took 18 months. It wasn't just the supplements - it was building from foundation work (exercise, sleep, breathing) through micro-exposures (making eye contact with cashiers) to full exposure therapy (public speaking, social events, leadership roles). But the supplements gave me the stability to do the actual work.

The person writing this now can speak at conferences, travel solo to foreign countries, and live a genuinely fulfilling life. That terrified teenager hiding in his room feels like a different person entirely.

If you're reading this while your heart races and your chest feels tight, I want you to know: there is another side to this. The path isn't the same for everyone, but there is always a path.

I documented everything - exact dosages, timing, side effects, what worked, what didn't, the mistakes I made so you don't have to. The complete guide includes my full story, detailed supplement protocols with warnings about cycling and timing, and the step-by-step process I used over 18 months. It's not theory from a textbook. It's what actually happened when someone with severe social anxiety tried everything to get his life back.

**If this resonates with you and you want the complete breakdown, I've put it together as a guide for £15.** It includes everything - the supplements that worked (and the ones that didn't), exact protocols, the exposure therapy process, and all the lessons I learned the hard way.

1nvisz8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nvisz8,Remodel Advice | Peninsula vs Island,"I've got a big remodel roughly planned and would appreciate any feedback.

Our general plan is to remove a load bearing wall and move the kitchen to the larger side of the room (see last pic for our current floorplan).

Originally I was dead-set that an island would not fit in the space but now I'm not so sure. The island shown is 30"" deep total (12"" overhang), and behind it is a door down to the basement that is totally unfinished and seldom used. The aisle between the island and basement door would see a lot of traffic since it's the path from our mudroom (right) to the living room (left). We definitely want seating at the island/peninsula.

In the lower, small side of the room where our kitchen currently sits, I half a half-baked plan of a coffee-bar and an L-shaped bench. Potentially trying to squeeze to much into the space. I'd like to have cozy seating, and additional storage space at the same time.

The 3d views show a beam hanging down into the space where the wall used to be. Not sure if that will be dropped as shown or concealed.

We love to cook and will often host people for dinner so functionality is definitely important. In either view I haven't fully fleshed out the details, the cabinets are just drop-in library models in the online tool I'm using.

It’s funny, I was just cleaning out a drawer the other day and found my old phone from like, four years ago. I turned it on for a laugh, and the lag was almost physical—it felt like wading through molasses. I’d forgotten how normal that slow decline felt, just accepting that a device had a two-year expiration date before the frustration set in.



That’s why I’ve been paying closer attention to the talk around the iPhone 17’s expected lifespan. It seems the focus is shifting from just raw speed to sustained performance, partly because of how the software and hardware are designed to work together long-term. It’s a different kind of upgrade, one you feel over years, not just at the unboxing.



Here’s a detail that stuck with me: I read that a lot of the perceived ""slowing down"" in older phones isn't just the battery. It's often because new apps and photo files are constantly getting more demanding, like trying to run today's software on yesterday's engine. The real trick is building a device that can handle that escalating workload, which is a much smarter goal than just a slight speed bump on day one.



So now, when I think about upgrading, my first question isn't about the camera specs anymore. It's, ""Will this thing still feel snappy when I'm trying to order coffee while half-awake in two years?"" That’s the real test, and it’s honestly more practical.

We all go into Porsche ownership for various reasons. Most of us, myself included, get bitten by the Porsche bug early in life. Then, spend a large chunk of that life striving for (and drooling over) getting one. A few of us lucky enough to eventually own a Porsche ""get it.""

Over the last week, I've had a couple of fun run-ins. I have a feeling this will be a normal occurrence. I'd love to hear some of your stories as well. 

First one: 

Last weekend I was on my way to play golf. I decided to make a pit stop at the local Safeway to grab some Gatorade. On the way, I passed a 997 Turbo. Now, it's rare enough to have one 997 driving (mine), let alone 2 in the same town, at the same time. So I waved, and he waved back. I go to the grocery store, get my Gatorade, come out, and he's parked right next to me. HA! So naturally, we chat. Turns out he saw me driving by, waved, turned around, and went to Starbucks to get a coffee. Which is right across from the grocery store. So he decided to park next to me to check out the car. At which time I came out of the store. So we struck up a conversation, showed off the cars, exchanged numbers, and proceeded to geek out over cars and golf. Btw, his Turbo was amazing, pushing nearly 1000 HP. New friend unlocked. 

Second one:

I was pulling into work. The parking lot is pictured in the attached photo. My company is in the same building as a Dunkin' Donuts. As I was pulling in, I saw a 991 waiting in the DD drive-through. He must've seen me from his rear-view mirror and proceeded to leave the drive-through and park next to me. Once again, we struck up a conversation, geeked out about our cars, and went about our days--with big smiles on both our faces.

Last to last Saturday, we went for a dinner date to celebrate her promotion. Very typical date night. Nothing out of the ordinary. And on Monday, I helped take her cat to the vet for an appointment.

She didn't contact me at all on Tuesday, except for one 'Good Morning' text. Wednesday morning she replied apologizing about being AWOL, stating that she had a busy day and was overwhelmed. We were back to normal texting and communicating for most of the day on Wednesday. In the evening, as we were chatting, I asked if she wanted to do something over the weekend. She replied with a very unlike her message of ""Sorry. No. I promised a friend to go on a hike.""

I pointed out why she was sounding so formal. And it's not like she was going for an all weekend hike. After a few minutes, asked if everything was okay between us. And she replied with ""You want more than I can give."" I asked what she meant, and she replied that she feels overwhelmed about our connection and that we should end things between us. I tried to reason with her, but then i told her to not come to a conclusion yet. And give ourselves a few days to process things.

I messaged her on Friday evening, with a lengthy text explaining how much she means to me. And just addressing her concerns. She still remained adamant on ending things. I asked if we could call, to which she said no. I asked if we could meet instead, and she didn't say anything.

Fast forward to the following day, she replies with ""Yes we can meet :)"". We settled for a coffee date for the weekend.

Yesterday, she posted her September recap on IG, and 4 of the 6 photos include me in some capacity. Either my arm, me from the back, in my car and flowers I got her. Her post has me all confused on what she is thinking, and what I can expect on Sunday.

She has an avoidant attachment style. Doesn't open up very much, needs her space, and also doesn't really talk things out. Otherwise, we are all lovey-dovey. Don't have any conflicts, and always joking and having some really nice, romantic moments.

Just looking to get some kind of perspective on what I can expect, or any women in here who can assess the situation and specifically her IG post?

This is not medical advice - it's just my personal experience that I'm sharing in hopes it might help others. Please consult with healthcare professionals before trying any supplements or treatments.**

I'm writing this because five years ago, I would have given anything to read something like this.

I was the kid who moved schools constantly. Always the outsider, always alone. I thought I was just independent. Then puberty hit during another move to a new high school, and something changed.

The first panic attack happened during a school assembly. My heart was pounding so hard I was convinced everyone could hear it. My chest locked up, I couldn't breathe, and my brain was screaming that everyone was watching me fall apart. The more I worried about people noticing, the worse it got.

I kept telling myself it would pass. It didn't.

For two years, I didn't leave a one-mile radius. School, then straight home to hide in my room. Every presentation was torture. Getting called on in class made my hands shake. I loved biology and wanted to become a doctor, but I realized that career required constant social interaction and presentations. How could I help others when I couldn't even speak up in a classroom?

I switched to software development. At least computers don't judge you.

By year 12, I couldn't take it anymore. I finally told my parents, expecting help. They laughed. They told me I was being ridiculous, that I was ""crazy."" That's when I learned I could only depend on myself.

I wanted professional help, but the thought of calling a doctor's office or sitting in a waiting room filled with strangers felt impossible. So I just accepted it. This was my life now.

Everything changed at university when I finally had some money of my own. I made a decision: this is where I end my suffering. I wasn't going to let anxiety control my life anymore.

I became obsessed. I researched every supplement, every therapy, every technique I could find. I tried everything - magnesium, ashwagandha, propranolol, 5-HTP, vitamin D3, L-theanine. Some did nothing. A few changed everything.

**What actually worked for me:**

**Propranolol** \- The first time I took 40mg before a university presentation, I couldn't believe what didn't happen. My hands didn't shake. My heart didn't race. My voice didn't crack. It blocks the physical panic symptoms without touching your mind. For the first time in years, I felt normal.

**Ashwagandha (1200mg daily)** \- After about a week, things that used to consume my thoughts just didn't matter as much. That classmate who made a snide comment? Instead of replaying it for hours, I found myself thinking ""whatever."" The presentation next week? Still nervous, but not the all-consuming dread.

**Magnesium (600mg before bed)** \- Fixed my sleep, which made everything else manageable. For years I'd lie in bed with my muscles tense, replaying every social interaction. With magnesium, my body actually relaxed.

**L-theanine (200mg before coffee)** \- Let me have coffee again. For two years I'd given it up because the jitters would trigger panic attacks. This amino acid removes the anxiety while keeping the focus. Getting my morning routine back felt like reclaiming a piece of myself.

The recovery took 18 months. It wasn't just the supplements - it was building from foundation work (exercise, sleep, breathing) through micro-exposures (making eye contact with cashiers) to full exposure therapy (public speaking, social events, leadership roles). But the supplements gave me the stability to do the actual work.

The person writing this now can speak at conferences, travel solo to foreign countries, and live a genuinely fulfilling life. That terrified teenager hiding in his room feels like a different person entirely.

If you're reading this while your heart races and your chest feels tight, I want you to know: there is another side to this. The path isn't the same for everyone, but there is always a path.

I documented everything - exact dosages, timing, side effects, what worked, what didn't, the mistakes I made so you don't have to. The complete guide includes my full story, detailed supplement protocols with warnings about cycling and timing, and the step-by-step process I used over 18 months. It's not theory from a textbook. It's what actually happened when someone with severe social anxiety tried everything to get his life back.

**If this resonates with you and you want the complete breakdown, I've put it together as a guide for £15.** It includes everything - the supplements that worked (and the ones that didn't), exact protocols, the exposure therapy process, and all the lessons I learned the hard way.

Are we just friends or what?,"Three weeks ago I (25M) hit up Dan (25M, pseudonym), who I saw on and off in Feb-May 2024, after around a year and a half of pretty minimal contact. He has a boyfriend now but I am getting weird vibes from him hinting he is still attracted to me. Can’t tell if it’s in my head or real.

Context: We saw each other about a dozen times during our situationship, but we spent quite a bit of time together working out, reading the news in bed/at cafes, chilling at cafes and doing work, etc and he went up to Baltimore once to see me.

I asked if he wanted to cuddle, but he said he couldn’t bc he had a bf and they were “still figuring it out.” He insisted on drinks/coffee, which we did about three weeks ago on a Thursday. He threw out plans to hang that weekend — going to a climbing gym near me (he had 2 guest passes), estate sale (I mentioned I was looking for home decor), working out.

We spent the entire day together (10:30-5pm) that Saturday at the estate sale/gym/cafe/bookstore. It reminded me of our situationship, just without the sex. I was weirded out he got naked in front of me at the gym when he had a bf, but maybe he’s just comfortable in the locker room. I made an effort to cover up before going to the stream room. When we left for the day he suggested we grab drinks the following week to chat more about my new job.

We ended up grabbing drinks Thursday. Pretty normal, making small talk about work/weekend plans. I suggest we work out together again; he agrees and says he has stuff to do in the afternoon. But we ended up spending the day together again, chilling at a cafe to do work. 

After we workout, we hit the sauna and then I do a cold shower. I’m heaving because of the cold and he makes a quip about it. I couldn’t hear so I turn off the shower and turn around. Apparently the shower curtain was pulled back slightly, and he’s looking at me and he makes his jab.

Another awkward moment: Before we hop to another cafe we use the restroom. I get out first and wait for him outside, head buried in my phone. He comes out, slaps my ass, and I’m surprised. He laughs it off.

By now, we’ve seen each other five times in just over two weeks. He seems to constantly have plans. So I’m curious why he’s spending entire days with me. He also brings up his boyfriend in some of our conversations. 

But I am seeing blurred lines here. Most people I’ve talked to say there’s something more than “just friends” going on, though some gay guys mentioned it’s common to be friends with former flings.

I’ve been telling myself we’re just friends. Maybe he’s just super comfortable around me. He already turned down cuddling and said he had a bf, so he drew a line.

I enjoy his company and could use friends in this city and he’s familiar territory. I don’t want to ruin that. But if there’s something more going on I want to know.

What’s the one small change that actually helped you get back on track?,"Hey everyone, a few years back, a major health crisis (blood clots in my lungs) put me on the sidelines for months. I went from being a pretty active dad in my 40s to being almost completely sedentary. And in that time, I gained 30 pounds.

Beyond the numbers on the scale, I just felt... weak. The playbook I'd used my whole life—""just eat less, move more""—wasn't working. I was exhausted, my muscles ached, and I fell into the trap of thinking I had to starve myself to lose the weight, which only made me feel more frail. Food went from being fuel to being this source of anxiety and confusion. I was just reacting—grabbing what was easy, eating out of frustration, and feeling totally passive.

It wasn't until I started learning about the *right* way to fuel a comeback that things clicked. The biggest lesson? Stop trying to change everything at once.

For me, the game-changer was incredibly simple: **I stopped skipping breakfast and started my day with protein.** No more grabbing a quick coffee and running on empty. I made a conscious choice to have a couple of eggs or a bowl of Greek yogurt.

It wasn't a magic bullet, but it was the first domino. It stabilized my energy, cut down on cravings later in the day, and for the first time, it felt like I was being *intentional* about my recovery instead of just a victim of it. It was the first step in treating food like a tool to rebuild, not a problem to be managed.

It made me realize how many of us are just guessing our way through nutrition, especially after a setback.

**So, my question for you is: What was the one small, intentional change you made with your nutrition that created the biggest positive ripple effect in your life?**

Firstly Thank to the almighty Allah who passed me through this exam and who gave me the ability and strength to study all over again for it. 

I d like to give back to this community and help those who might be in a similar situation as I was in a year ago. My whole life I was afraid of failing an exam and then boom I got an F on the most important exam of my Life!! Getting that F when you have never previously failed in any exam is DEVASTATING and hard to cope up with but Allah has ways of testing his creation.

I recklessly took step 1 after studying for 4 months (I was studying on and off through my 4th and final year, doing bnb and FA) and after doing 80% uworld and having an avg of 58 in NBMEs hoping I d review them well and pass the exam (because a lot of people had done it before)

Well jokes on me I didn’t and thats because

1. I was burnt out because I wasn’t taking breaks aka a full day off, so even though I was studying and reviewing things, My brain wasn’t working efficiently hence I wasn’t able to retain stuff and kept making the same mistakes over and over again

2. I did 2 blocks and went out the hall and realized I did couple of qs wrong and after that my brain just shut down and I went down a spiral of anxiety and messed up the rest of the blocks 

3. I wasn’t able to sleep well had only 3 hrs of sleep which clearly isn’t enough 

4. I took panadol/caffeine tablets (for migraine) and coffee which i guess accelerated my anxiety

5. Didn’t give enough time to review nbmes because I was always in a hurry to finish it

6. Booked my triad and date way too early which put pressure on me and i realized i don’t work well with pressure. It only adds more stress and affects my studies negatively 

My resources were FA, Uworld, uwsa (only did 1), nbmes (did from 25-31 except 28), Free 120s, BNB, Bootcamp when needed and Randy neil for biostats and ofc dirty medicine for whatever topics i felt like i needed to review.

Enough about my mistakes, let’s talk about how to overcome them and the changes I did. Yes I took a year, but I believe this was the time Allah had written for me to give this exam again

So I started again after about a month of getting the F
Reset my uworld and went through it on random mode, FA and Bnb (for my weak parts) supplemented with bootcamp for physio wherever needed. Luckily I found a study partner and went through FA with them once again so that makes it twice.  

I also took my DAY OFF per week RELIGIOUSLY and spent time with family and friend WITHOUT feeling guilty. This helped a lot with regaining my strength again for the week.

Finished uworld to 80% and started from NBME 20-24, and then 25-32 and all uwsa and free 120s. (thanked the lord once again that I did not remember the question of the nbmes I did a year back). I finished rest of the uworld  during my NBME period and started doing incorrects, however I wasn’t able to finish the incorrects.
In the beginning of your prep give 4 days to review an NBME. Meaning 50qs per day and then eventually u ll be able to review them in 2-3 days.

When I started I was struck with anxiety. My body used to start shivering when I got an answer wrong and my brain  would shut down while doing uworld, I d have ringing ears or as we call it ‘tinnitus’. I felt like a failure and I d stop studying. Then would come back to it after i had calmed down. This went on for a good 3 months. The days were good when I was scoring well and bad when my scores were bad, but we have to learn from the mistakes and move on and Thanks to the Almighty, I did eventually, and with time even if I was scoring in 50s in uworld I would just take it as a learning point.

So tell urself UWORLD is a LEARNING TOOL!!! don’t be disheartened if ur scores drop or if u make a silly mistake. LEARN and MOVE ON. 

My SP wanted to review FA once again before their exam so I did it the third time with them. (Honestly I suck when it comes to re studying but having a SP makes it bearable)

To keep revising I also added the HY GURU NBME concept playlist and did it whenever I didn’t feel like studying or in the morning to start my brain.
I also started with Mehlmann ARROWs and made notes and went with ALL mehlmann pdfs (the qs not the boxes)  when I had few nbmes left. It just helps with revision. I also did some of the qs he has on spotify early on but I couldnt keep up with it.

I did Anki throughout med school but couldn’t keep up with it during the last few month. I d recommend if someone is in their med school, they should do anki on daily basis and if someone is studying for steps they can do the anki for their Uworld incorrects and even Nbmes. (It’s there in the Anking deck)

When I was scoring well above 75, I booked my triad and then when I felt my prep was good enough, I booked my date (2-3 weeks before the date)

For biostats genetics, ethics and pharma i did: (practice makes man perfect so the more qs I did the better I felt and ofc learnt)
1. Randy neill for biostats
2. Mehlmann pdfs

One of the things I did this time was to revise the previous nbme before doing the next one. Wasn’t consistent with it but did it very often and it helped.  I also recomment doing the DIRTY MEDICINE QBANK playlist !! It’s just 53-55 ish qs but they re fun to do and he tells you what the keywords are that would help you pick the right answer and how you can eliminate ! Can easily listen to it while walking or while eating!!

Also always read the Question and the line before it first and then skim the stem! It HELPS SAVE TIME A LOT!!  Do NOT , I repeat, DO NOT change your answers UNLESS you are a 100% sure!! The first instinct is USUALLY RIGHT!!!
Also practice doing uworld on Dark mode, 7 hrs is a long time to be looking at the screen so you can do your exam on Dark mode and minimize the eye strain!!

Do NBMES on timed mode. ( I did them offline with an alarm on)
Make sure you have practiced doing 7 blocks (280 qs) a day ATLEAST ONCE, I did it 3 times. You can do nbmes and do a remaining uworld block or incorrects or a free120. It’s upto you!

Your last 2 weeks before the exam should be revising nbmes u did and revising ur weak topics from FA, your uworld notes, listen to the murmurs, see the radio images and history images, the famous NBME images pdf, FA Rapid Review and ECG images

The day before the exam I just revised my stuff and stopped everything by 6pm
To anyone reading this, I d advise you to just study for like 5-6 hrs max, do your workouts, tire urself out and then relax and sleep at about 10 pm Max

Last time exam day was filled with anxiety and restlessness
This time I was more confident, trusted God, gave my 100%, wasn’t reckless, went into the exam with confidence. Had 5-6 hrs sleep, warmed up in the morning with jumping jacks, had a good high protein nutrient filled breakfast. 
TOOK BREAKS AFTER EVERY BLOCK!!! (this is sooo essential, wether u get out or not just take 5 mins and keep ur head down and relax and calm urself) 
I had nuts and dark chocolate during the break and would walk for a while and then go back and start again. Watch the tutorial ahead while doing ur free120 so u can get 15 extra mins and a total of 1 hr for the break!!

Also last time when I got out It was all a blur and felt like the qs came out of the planet BUT TBH thats only the case when you re under prepared

This time I felt I knew the topic, yes they twist the wordings to increase the difficulty level but it is ALL THE NBME topics just worded in a difficult way. It’s a DOABLE exam, but only when you are prepared well enough and for that TRUST YOUR NBMES!!!

1nviglk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRavensDream/comments/1nviglk/my_haunted_house/,My haunted house,"Hey Raven! I love your channel and just wanted to add that I love how you give us little updates and talk to us at the beginning of each podcast. It humanizes you and makes you seem like more than a voice on the radio. Anyway, I've submitted a few of my true stories on here before, and everytime you read one on the podcast, I feel temporarily famous. Anyway, I've been putting off sending this one in because it's so long, but it's certainly one of the craziest places I've lived, so I figured I'd send it in. So here goes: 

In December of 2019, I started renting a new house in a small town in Nebraska from the parents of my boyfriend at the time. It was the type of small town where you can just be walking through the grocery store parking lot on a windy day, minding your own business, when a corn husk will slap you in the face. The house was a little big for the two of us since it was a three bedroom/two bathroom house, but we needed a place so we moved in. At first, nothing really happened but I started to feel like I was being watched. One night, soon before my alarm went off at 3 am (I work super early), I was awoken by 3 slow knocks on the wall right next to me. I asked my boyfriend, ""Are you awake?"" He said, ""Yeah."" I said, ""Was that 3?"" And he confirmed that it was. I'm not sure if you've heard this, but 3 is supposedly supposed to be an evil or negative number. A few nights later, we heard a slight scraping noise and then a soft whoosh noise shortly after we went to bed. About five feet from our bedroom door was the dining room table and chairs. I whispered to my boyfriend that I thought a chair had moved and he agreed. The next morning, we were talking about it again and he asked ""What was that soft whoosh noise after the chair scrape noise?"" I said that I didn't know but was wondering that myself. A few days later, I was talking to my boyfriend in the dining room. I pulled out a chair and sat down. The cushion I sat on made a soft whoosh noise. My jaw dropped and I looked at my boyfriend to see his eyes wide open. I said, ""That's the sound! Holy crap, a freaking ghost pulled out a chair and sat down!"" We had a basement and my boyfriend had a mantel clock on a shelf down there. One day, he went downstairs to find the mantel clock had somehow fallen off the shelf. The craziest part is that it broke into 3 pieces and was frozen at 3 o'clock when it broke. One night, I had gone out grocery shopping and was putting the groceries away in the kitchen. I heard a super loud ""Ha!"" that echoed through the house. I jumped and then laughed, saying ""Kory, you asshole! You scared the crap out of me!"" The sound came echoing up from the staircase so I went downstairs to tell my boyfriend that he got me. There was no one downstairs. I came upstairs to see my boyfriend walking in the front door. I said, ""Were you just in the basement?"" And he said, ""No, I was hanging out at Oliver's house. Why?"" And when I told him what happened, he got concerned, grabbed a knife and checked every nook and cranny in the house. The front and back doors had both been locked. One of the scariest things that happened to me still haunts me. I went to bed early cuz I worked early. One night, I crawled into bed and laid down on my stomach to sleep. My boyfriend told me goodnight, turned off the light, and closed the door. I remembered I wanted to ask him something. I called, ""Kory!"" trying to get his attention to come back. He didn't hear so I shouted louder, ""KORY!"" And then, I heard a male voice loudly say ""WHAT?!"" right behind my head. I was on my stomach and never flipped over so fast in my life. There was nothing there. Kory came back in and said, ""Did you call for me?"" I told him what happened and he said it wasn't him. It couldn't have been him anyway because the voice sounded like it was a foot behind my head. The last weird thing that happened was when we were watching a movie. Right at a scary part of the movie, ""Doctor Sleep"", we heard a super loud bang and we both jumped up off the couch. You know how when you hear a sound that you're not sure what it was or where it came from, and your mind imagines a possible scenario of what the noise was? Well I imagined a car slamming into the front of the house. I looked out the front window and saw nothing. I started putting on my shoes to go investigate. My wimpy boyfriend said he wasn't going out there with me so I went alone. It was around midnight and not only was there no car crash anywhere, but it was snowing and there were no cars or tire tracks in the street. I walked all around the house to see if there were any footprints in the snow or any branches that had fallen off the tree onto the house. Nothing. I still don't know what that was. Shortly after we moved in, a coworker of mine saw my car at that address and asked me if I lived there. I said yes and he said, ""There's something weird going on in that house. My friend lived there and let me stay in the basement when I needed a place to stay. One night when I got home, I put my plastic soda bottle on the coffee table and plopped on the couch to go to sleep. A little while later, I woke up when my soda bottle opened on its own and sprayed soda all over as if it had been shaken up. I also got woken up a different night when my phone, which had been on the coffee table, suddenly landed on me like it had been thrown."" My boyfriend and I found a smaller place almost a year after we moved in and were moving out. I was in the basement on my hands and knees scrubbing the floor. I had both lids on the toilet up and was dumping my dirty water buckets into the toilet and refilling with clean water. I had been doing this for awhile, when the toilet lids both slammed closed. The lids had been up for about an hour without falling, and I wasn't even in the bathroom at the time. And even if they had finally decided to fall after being up for so long, this was not the sound of them just falling. They had been pushed, hard. I tried reenacting the sound and had to push hard to make them make such a loud noise. I said out loud, ""I'm almost done down here and then you can have the basement back to yourselves"" to any ghosts that were possibly angry at me for invading their space. I pulled my phone out to take a pic of the basement to send to my boyfriend to show how clean it was, and a large orb zoomed across my viewfinder right before I took the picture. My boyfriend's parents had lived in it while they remodeled it before we moved in and they said they never had anything weird happen, but there was a man who had hung himself in the attached garage before they bought the house and remodeled the garage into two extra bedrooms. I think I may know why my boyfriend and I had so much activity in that house. We had a toxic relationship and he verbally and mentally abused me and gaslighted me for years before I got the courage to leave. I was always so stressed out, anxious, and walking on eggshells, scared of when he would blow up and start screaming at me about how worthless I was. I heard that ghosts are very sensitive to emotions and energies and I think I was disrupting the energy in the house and made the ghosts upset and that's why they were so active. Oh! I almost forgot! My mom stayed with me once and got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. She walked into the kitchen to check the time on the clock. She heard my voice right behind her say, ""Mom?"" and when she turned around, no one was there. She said the creepiest part was that it had my voice. Anyway, that's my story. 

Also, in case you need a little supernatural-related comic relief after that, I have a short funny story. After I left for college, my dad remodeled our house and added on a movie theater onto our house. Nothing even remotely strange happened before that, but after it was built, weird stuff started happening. My brother told my parents that there were spirits in the basement. The kitchen table was at the top of the stairs. My brother came up from his room in the basement at dinnertime. There was a loud bang a few moments later. My mom and dad looked questioningly at my brother. He calmly said, ""It's the spirits. They want me to come back down."" My mom, ever the comedian, turned her head towards the stairs and called, ""He's eating dinner right now!""",1,1759348103.0,TheRavensDream,0,1.0,False

I am pretty experienced with espresso, and can usually dial things in quite well. Recently though I’ve been struggling. Additionally I’ve noticed that my pucks are always very very soggy. If I use a puck screen there is usually a puddle of water on top after extracting. I thought with the 3-way solenoid on the bambino+ that this shouldn’t happen?

The solenoid works because during a backflush clean cycle it does dispense in to the drip tray.

Grinder is pretty new, but don’t think seasoning would cause that issue.

I can get a coffee dialled in pretty well, then next day, without changing settings it either goes too fast or too slow. Could there be an issue with my machine?

1nvieie,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/1nvieie/what_is_the_working_class_for_you/,"What is the ""working class"" for you?","It seems to me that this concept is taking on a broader and more inclusive meaning.

When I was younger, that's how manufacturing workers proudly called themselves. They hardly included salespeople or service workers; essentially, the working class was = the productive class. 

I mean, not many people used those exact terms, after 70 years, they've gotten a little tired of the terminology. They just didn't think that anyone else was doing any real work.

In general, I remember a disdain for salespeople and the like, for anyone who doesn't make something real with their hands. I have a story about this. My grandmother wanted to give on a birthday to my brother a Montana watch of new model (There were 10 melodies and colored cells that flashed when the stopwatch was running). Back then, it cost 600,000 karbovantsev(about 3 dollars I think). She didn't have enough money left from last month pension, so she decided to sell 3 jars of raspberries on a local market. She was selling berries from her dacha, selling it for less than the market price, but nevertheless she nearly died of shame and felt ill. And she was shaking all over. 

She would certainly have been very surprised that some ""speculators"" were included in the working class simply because they weren't very good at their jobs and couldn't steal enough from honest people to be considered bourgeois. 

I'm not saying I agree with her definition, it's just that these were the kind of ironclad people I remember. They were very simple and very proud. And yes, they considered everyone who had more than 25 reals in their pocket to be petty bourgeoisie. 

And I don't even know, I'm kind of working class, but I hardly do anything useful in my life. Unlike them, I don’t smelt metal or plow the fields. I'm doing some kind of crap on the internet that doesn't feed anyone and doesn't help anyone. And even when I worked as a barista, I don't think those people would have agreed that I could be put in the same category as blacksmiths and mechanics. They would have said that honest workers don't go to coffee shops, that I am lackey of the bourgeoisie. So I kind of sense the hatred from the souls of my ancestors when I call myself working class. 

What do you think about this ? Are realtors also working class ?

1nviatq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nviatq/does_waterdrop_wdedfa_replacement_filter_deliver/,Does Waterdrop WD-EDFA Replacement Filter Deliver on Alkaline Water Quality Review?,"Waterdrop WD-EDFA Alkaline Filters Replacement for Waterdrop Electric Pitchers landed on my kitchen counter a few weeks ago, and I’ve been putting it through its paces ever since. These little cylindrical wonders promise to not only filter water effectively but also provide alkaline water with a pH boost. With 200 gallons or three months of filtration possible per filter, I had to see how it held up to its claims, or if I’d just end up grumbling about another overhyped product. Spoiler alert: it's solid—but there are a few points you might want to consider before diving in.

**Ease of Use and Setup**  
The first thing I noticed was just how easy these filters were to install. No tools, no rocket science—just pop them in the compatible Waterdrop Electric Pitchers and you’re good to go. Before I even got started, replacing filters was one of my least favorite chores, especially with some other overly complicated brands, but this was refreshingly hassle-free. It’s worth noting that these filters fit models like the Waterdrop WD-ED01AB, WD-ED01W, and others from their lineup, which makes compatibility a non-issue.

**Positives**  
- Minimal hassle installation—truly no tools needed.  
- Provides alkaline water, increasing its pH by 1.5-2.5 points.  
- Filters 200 gallons or lasts up to three months, meaning less replacement frequency.  
- BPA-free and lead-free construction ensures safe water every time.  

[Find the best price for Waterdrop WD-EDFA on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0chmqs382/)

**Filtration and Water Quality**  
It promises to filter out over 30 contaminants, and luckily, the water doesn't taste like you’re sipping from an old garden hose anymore. The secret lies in its 5-micron carbon block filter material that excels at everything from eliminating chlorine to reducing trace impurities. I’ve tested it with tap water that typically has slightly odd tastes and found that the Waterdrop filters effectively masked those flavors. Both tea and coffee brewed with the filtered water had significantly better clarity as well. That said, the filtration won’t magically turn heavily contaminated water into something you’d drink a gallon of, but for everyday use, it shines.

**Safe Materials and Build Quality**  
Knowing this filter is crafted with BPA-free and lead-free materials gave me peace of mind. This is something people often overlook until they're halfway through a glass of water wondering if their filter’s materials are secretly plotting against their health. The shell looks sleek yet sturdy and isn’t prone to any carbon leakage, which I’ve experienced with a competitor’s cheaper alternative (an unwelcome black grainy surprise in the water, if you’re wondering).

**Highlights**  
- Compatible with multiple Waterdrop pitcher models.  
- Reliable performance against chlorine and unpleasant tastes.  
- Enhanced clarity in beverages like tea and coffee.  

**Considerations and Caveats**  
It's not all sunshine and alkaline rainbows, though. For me, one of the cons was the initial cost. Alkaline filters tend to be pricier than their standard counterparts, and this product is no different. Another issue was the somewhat uneven pH boost. Testing indicated the increase sometimes fluctuated depending on water type. Lastly, given the 200-gallon filtering capacity, heavy water users who go through gallons quickly might find themselves replacing filters more frequently than they'd like.

**Negative Attributes**  
- Initial cost is higher than standard filters.  
- pH boost isn’t perfectly consistent depending on water conditions.  
- Busy households may hit the 200-gallon limit faster than expected.

**Comparing to Competitors**  
While testing, I compared the Waterdrop filters with some competing brands, like Brita and ZeroWater. Brita offers affordability, but it doesn’t include alkaline filtration, which sets the Waterdrop apart. On the other hand, ZeroWater boasts ultra-fine filtration but often leaves water tasting overly “processed,” which was less appealing than the more natural taste provided here. Waterdrop finds a sweet spot: better-tasting water and enhanced health benefits from alkaline water features. That said, ZeroWater’s filtration removes even more impurities, albeit with an added cost and a steeper installation learning curve.

**Value Proposition**  
Comparing it to other replacement filters, I’d confidently say this is a product for those who crave upgraded water quality and don't mind investing a bit more for improved pH levels. Importantly, the performance has managed to justify the cost so far. For those eyeing budgets, there are more affordable options, but you’ll sacrifice the alkaline feature, safety-certified materials, or lifespan. Bottom line—if alkaline water is your jam, this is worth the splurge.

i wear comfy supportive sneakers when walking, i’ve out grown wearing going out shoes like converse on a daily just because it’s a fashionable shoe. i save my going out shoes or heels for very specific occasions. i try and rotate my shoes so im not wearing one pair down as quickly. this is super new for me. 

i cannot go in the pit for concerts anymore. i like to see the whole performance and i like my own space. i don’t care to be close to celebs as much either anymore. it’s cool when it happens, but i don’t go insane over it (im also a musician so this may be a huge factor) 

i used to ridiculously speed on this one road because it felt like a roller coaster. now i find myself going the speed limit because it’s dangerous. 

i stopped myself from eating a piece of hard candy while driving because it’s too much of a chance to take. thats dangerous. 

when i go to bars, it’s super super fun and i love dancing, but im super picky with who i go with. 

i’ve become very responsible in how i spend my money. i actually think about it instead of impulse buying. 

if i don’t need something, im not gonna take it, even if its free (free pens and little lanyards from college fairs, etc etc) im not talking about gifts or whatnot 

yesterday was the first time i thought twice to myself about buying merch at a concert. and ended up buying the cheapest item because it was worth for what it was vs buying a shirt for the price of gas money 

i stopped myself from buying a whole new outfit for a concert to fit the theme. 

i’m starting to dislike the hype of coffee chains because they really aren’t worth your money. i have tried local spots that are so much better by a long shot (taste over trendy) 

i used to drive long distances at night and now it just bothers me to drive in the dark it’s so hard to see 

these are just some things that have stuck out to me, lmk what your experiences have been like!

Reaching out for some last-minute advice. I (23F) was asked out on a date last week by a man who I am gushing to be in his mid-40s (although I’m not sure of his actual age). He saw me in a museum coffee shop, said hello and began chatting me up. General stuff, like where I am from and stuff, but he also said that he would like to take me to dinner at a restaurant on the lake and not so subtly mentioned he had a boat. lol.

I ended up giving him my business card, expecting him not to reach out, but he did and we made plans to get dinner this evening at 7 (at that public restaurant on the lake).

I’ve been deliberating about it and talking with my friends. Obviously there is a dynamic and agenda, that’s nothing new necessarily, socially-historically. I’ve been mulling over the thought that this “thing” may be transactional and I’m putting myself in a position where I am an object and not the one in “power.”

My friends (also in their 20s) are telling me to just do it because why not. But I can’t think of it that simply. I’m definitely not going home with him, with the specific justification/situation that I’m picking up my friend from the airport later tonight. 

I just don’t want to put myself into a naive and ridiculous situation. This seems like something that I could look back on at 40 and go “what was I thinking” or hell even at 26. BUT there’s a big difference between intellectualizing something versus actually understanding it and being able to more forward with it.

Another part of me also doesn’t want to jump to conclusions or project something unfairly onto someone I don’t know, I’ve been working on that in other parts of my life recently. I shouldn’t just assume this guy is predatory or something because he is seeking out someone younger than him (or should I?)

I’m conflicted but want to go into this situation respectfully and mindfully without having knives out. I don’t want to put myself into a spot, but I want to be open to dating. 

Please give me your thoughts. I’m looking for a diverse mix of options and can provide any context or answer any questions. ❤️❤️❤️",0,1759347641.0,dating_advice,40,0.33,False

Apple, ginger root tea, rice milk, freshly boiled chicken, boiled eggs, mashed potatoes with butter, green beans, pasta, rice cakes with butter, sweet potato, (all 1/10 or 2/10)

Honey (3/10), potato waffles (4/10), chewing gum (6/10), tea (7/10) coffee (8/10), vodka (7/10), brandy (8/10), my beloved cat and dog (8/10)

I took photos of ingredients in a lot of cases and it would give a great breakdown. I'm trying to stay in the 1/10 or 2/10 range for now and I'm hoping to have a complete reset.

Living with my parents so they treat me like i'm still a teenager and i have to follow their rules because they still have to pay for things for me. Like they have a rule i can't go out without permission because i need to stay home and do chores since i'm out of work. I can't even meet him for coffee or a ice cream cone wihtout their permission.

My boyfriend and i have been dating about 18 months and he treats me really well. But my mom hates him and doesn't let me take anything from him because it'll make me ""too dependent"" and that i should pay for my own stuff instead of relying on a man. He's paid for our dates, sometimes he surprises me with takeout and some other things and my mom just gets so mad. Like genuinely just furious at me and yells at me for ""taking advantage"" of his money.

We had another big fight today. We walked around Targetand she screamed at me because i didn't buy him anything for his birthday like he treated me for mine. I started to buy myself something but she gave me a disapproving look. On the ride home, we dropped him off and she saw his home and this made her even madder at me. I love him but he doesn't have the nicest home, it's a little old and kind of rundown but she yelled at me and called me spoiled and accused me of taking advantage of him again

She always tells me he's been a better friend to me then i have to him.

She also weirdly never calls him my boyfriend, just my friend and insists he's not my boyfriend, but he is. She acts like i can't have a boyfriend. That i have too many debts and problems to have a boyfriend. She always guilt trips me about seeing him and that i should be job hunting or try to get back into college any time i try to call him.

I don't ask for money, he just likes to treat me. He always just it's what guys are supposed to do

What can i do? How do i get my parents to start seeing me as an adult and to that i'm not taking advantage of his money and to let me date without them making a headache of everything?

tl;dr - i live with my parents because of mental health problems, they don't like me dating and that i should focus on working and not dating and she gets mad about everything he does for me or gives me.

Journey into a haunted town shrouded in evil fog, where dark secrets are revealed, and the legend of the Green Witch is born.  
  
Watch as Sarah Marshall stands trial for the unholy crime of witchcraft. When she rises to curse those who condemned her, the entire town of Calico is forever changed. Once-proud townsfolk transform into a terrifying horde of monstrous creatures, doomed to roam the streets with an endless hunger for the living.  
  
Unearth the paranormal history of Calico, uncover the origins of the Scary Farm’s most iconic legend, and experience one of the most chilling haunted houses ever created.  
  
Dare to enter the curse.  
  
Nightmares have been revealed, and the fog has settled on the 2025 Knott’s Scary Farm event with a chilling lineup of mazes, scare zones, and shows. This year brings two new haunted experiences: The Zoo, where abandoned animal enclosures have been transformed into a laboratory of horrifying animal-human experiments, and Mary — The Haunting of Worth Home, a terrifying journey through a haunted house with dark secrets lurking behind every mirror. As announced at Midsummer Scream, both The Grimoire and Mesmer: Sideshow of the Mind return for their final year, making this your last chance to experience them. Popular returning mazes include Eight Fingers Nine: The Boogeyman, Widows, Room 13, Cinema Slasher, The Chilling Chambers, and Origins: The Curse of Calico. Fans will also encounter familiar frights in scare zones such as Ghost Town Streets, The Gore-ing 20’s, Carnevil, Forsaken Lake—complete with its haunting Funeral Procession—and The Gauntlet, which has returned with a fresh new twist.  
  
In addition to the mazes and scare zones, Knott’s Scary Farm 2025 features a variety of live shows and seasonal offerings. Guests can laugh and scream at The Hanging: There’s a New Tariff in Town, be mystified by Conjurers at the Bird Cage Theater, or be dazzled by dark carnival acts in Le Magnifique Carnaval du Grotesque on the Calico Mine Stage. Beyond the scares, fans can also explore Into the Fog: A Scary Farm Tribute Art Show, check out props and history in the Legacy Store and Museum, or enjoy seasonal overlays like the Halloween Hootenanny on Timber Mountain Log Ride. Special event extras include the return of No Boo Necklaces for those who want a scare-free experience, Haunt Lanterns with over 100 interactive activations throughout the park, and special appearances by The Boulet Brothers on select nights.  
  
Knott’s Scary Farm 2025 runs for 30 fright-filled nights from September 18 through November 1, with hours from 7:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and until 1:00 a.m. on select Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays. Tickets range from single-night admission starting at $64 to all-inclusive VIP packages, with options such as the Scary Farm Pass, Boo-fet dining, Fright & Fast Lane, and the Very Important Monster Tour. With over 1,000 monsters roaming the fog, terrifyingly creative mazes, immersive scare zones, and a legacy spanning more than 50 years, Knott’s Scary Farm continues to reign as the largest and longest-running Halloween theme park event in Southern California. This year’s lineup proves once again why Knott’s remains a must-visit destination for horror fans and thrill seekers ready to face their darkest fears.

(What you doing? Don't look at the Swiss Account numbers they all falsified by the opposition!)

Following our independence El President found **Agrarianism**, **rural development** and **family farming** as the way to go for our new nation, a mass plantations plan have been made (which started at the colonial era) to our era, and until 1918 we have made **3 Tobacco**, **2 Cotton**, **2 Suger**, **1 Coffee**, **1 Pineapple**, **1 Corn** and **1 Banana** Farms.

As you can see from our workforce (Picture 3) out of our population - 283, **168 are employed, out of them 104 people are working on our farms! A true agricultural society**! Indeed as an agriculture country the majority of the population are poor so we make sure to build country houses so they can feed themselves and also afford those house, but the homeless problem still high.

As our happiness are going hand with hand with the overall happiness around our Caribbean neighborhoods (Picture 4).

Thanks to our agricultural institutions we export the majority of our agriculture products outside the country (Making up to 16K-18K!), but a ship come every 6 months, so we have plans to expand our farms and docks in the future, we also get sometimes about 4K of Aid from the Allies, and they asked us to export 10K of fruits for them, which we will do slowly, we want to become part of Allies!

**As for our factions** (Picture 5) - both the Religious and Militarists factions support us or have positive attitude of us, we have great relationships with the capitalist aswell! While our medical system is free and so our food, the Communist factions aren't happy with us.

**The Communist Leader (Picture 6) 40 years old Lucilla Perez local Leader of the teamsters Union decided to run against the President Ambrosio Al-Fayeed**,  they don't like our **""secular state"" and ""wealthy citizens vote""** articles in our constitution, the Communists are far larger faction then the capitalists after all they the party of the **Peasants and Workers**.

The 1918 election were close alot, 2 months before the election the polls showed 51% of support for the President, and 49% for the Communist Party, in our last effort we have decided to build a new church but unfortunately construction were slow so we decided to put some more money (as you see going to debt) to instantly construct it to boost the Religious Faction support (we also decided to ""cheat"" and put some extra votes in the Ballots box).

**The election results are in! 61% voted in favor of President Ambrosio Al-Fayeed, 66 Votes for El President - 44 votes for Lucilla Perez, now after securing his presidential seat Ambrosio need to secure his power and his country economic future - is agriculture power house is the way to? Or industrialization can't be avoided? We almost lost the election should we even hold the next one when the time comes? Should we fight the communist or try to work with then**?

1nvhxxu,https://i.redd.it/v6bz8i4mxjsf1.jpeg,Why didn’t Walt just sue Elliot using the legal service of Hamlin Hamlin McGill? Is he stupid?,"**Setting**: A dimly lit coffee shop in Albuquerque. Walter White, in his signature black hat and jacket, sits across from Charles ""Chuck"" McGill, impeccably dressed in a suit, though visibly tense, his hands fidgeting slightly due to his electromagnetic hypersensitivity concerns. They’re discussing Walter’s grievance against Elliot Schwartz, who Walt believes stole his share of Gray Matter Technologies.

**Walter White**: (leaning forward, voice low but intense) Chuck, I need your help. Elliot Schwartz screwed me over. Gray Matter was my idea, my work, and he pushed me out. Now it’s worth billions, and I’m scraping by teaching high school. I want to sue him, take back what’s mine.

**Charles McGill**: (adjusting his glasses, speaking with measured precision) Walter, I understand your frustration, but let’s approach this logically. You’re talking about Gray Matter Technologies, a multi-billion-dollar company. Suing Elliot would require a clear legal basis. What exactly happened when you left? Were there contracts, agreements, or any documentation of your contributions?

**Walter**: (clenching his fist) Contributions? I *created* the damn company! I was the one in the lab, Chuck, working out the chemistry, the foundation of their tech. Elliot and Gretchen, they were just along for the ride. Then I… I left, and they capitalized on it. No contract, just my ideas. My sweat.

**Chuck**: (raising an eyebrow) No contract? That complicates things significantly. Without a written agreement—stock certificates, partnership documents, or even emails outlining your role—your claim is anecdotal. The court needs evidence. Did you ever discuss ownership percentages or intellectual property rights before you parted ways?

**Walter**: (scoffs) We were grad students, Chuck. We didn’t have lawyers or fancy paperwork. It was me and Elliot in a garage, dreaming big. I trusted him. Then I walked away for… personal reasons. Next thing I know, they’re building an empire on *my* work. That’s theft, plain and simple.

**Chuck**: (leaning back, tapping his fingers) It’s not theft in the eyes of the law unless you can prove you had a stake. New Mexico law, like most jurisdictions, relies heavily on documented intent for business partnerships. If you voluntarily left without securing your share, Elliot and Gretchen could argue you abandoned your claim. Do you have *anything*—lab notes, patent filings, even a witness to your contributions?

**Walter**: (gritting his teeth) My name’s on the original patent applications, buried somewhere in their archives. I was naive, Chuck, not stupid. But Elliot’s smart—he’ll bury that evidence or claim it was all his idea. I need someone like you to tear him apart in court, make him admit what he did.

**Chuck**: (sighs, rubbing his temple) Walter, I’m not unsympathetic, but this is a steep hill. Patent applications could help, but we’d need to dig them up and prove you were integral to the IP’s creation *and* that you were wrongfully excluded from its benefits. Even then, statutes of limitations might apply—how long ago did you leave Gray Matter?

**Walter**: (pauses, voice quieter) Early ‘90s. I walked away… thought I was doing the right thing. Didn’t think they’d turn it into *this*.

**Chuck**: (shaking his head) Over 30 years? That’s well beyond the statute of limitations for most claims—breach of contract, fiduciary duty, you name it. Unless we can prove ongoing fraud or concealment, which is a high bar, the court won’t even hear it. Why didn’t you pursue this sooner?

**Walter**: (eyes darkening) I had a life to live, Chuck. A family. I didn’t want to drag this up until… until now. Things have changed. I’m not letting Elliot get away with this anymore. There’s got to be a way—some legal angle you can work. You’re supposed to be the best, right?

**Chuck**: (bristling slightly at the flattery) Flattery won’t change the law, Walter. My expertise is in corporate and securities law, but even I can’t rewrite history. We could explore a long shot—like unjust enrichment or a constructive trust—but you’d need to show Elliot knowingly profited off your work while excluding you. And we’d need evidence that holds up in discovery. (pauses) Tell me, why now? What’s driving this?

**Walter**: (leans closer, voice low and dangerous) I’m dying, Chuck. Cancer. I’ve got nothing left to lose, and I’m not leaving my family with nothing while Elliot lives like a king on my legacy. This isn’t just about money—it’s about respect. He took that from me.

**Chuck**: (softens slightly, but remains professional) I’m sorry about your health, Walter. Truly. But emotion won’t win in court. If we pursue this, it’s a long, expensive fight against a well-funded opponent. Elliot’s got top-tier counsel, no doubt. My firm, HHM, could take it on, but we’d need something concrete to start with. Old correspondence, a witness, anything. Without it, we’re tilting at windmills.

**Walter**: (smirks bitterly) Windmills. You sound like you’re scared of a fight, Chuck. I thought you McGills were made of tougher stuff. I’ll get you evidence—lab notes, whatever’s left. Just tell me you’ll take this bastard down when I do.

**Chuck**: (meets Walt’s gaze, firm) I don’t back down from fights, Walter, but I don’t waste my time on lost causes either. Get me something tangible—names, dates, documents—and I’ll review it. If there’s a case, I’ll build it. But you need to understand: this is a long shot, and it’ll cost you, financially and otherwise. Are you prepared for that?

**Walter**: (nods, resolute) I’m prepared to do whatever it takes. Elliot’s going to pay, one way or another.

**Chuck**: (nods slowly) Then start digging. Bring me what you find, and we’ll talk next steps. (pauses, softer) And Walter… don’t let this consume you. I’ve seen men destroy themselves chasing justice that’s out of reach.

**Walter**: (cold smile) Too late for that, Chuck. Way too late.

1nvhvy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nvhvy7/beginner_struggling_to_dial_in_new_beans/,Beginner struggling to dial in new beans. Workflow/dialing help. [Timemore 64s /Gaggia Classic e24],"Hi all I'm new to coffee and was hoping to get some help on dialing in/my process.

This is my 5th bag of coffee (I've been getting 16 oz bags from my local roasters ranging from dark to medium light). This my first bag of single origin beans, and it has me struggling mightily to dial them in.

I was hoping to get some advice.

Here's what I'm working with:
Coffee: Halo Beriti.  
Roast: Medium darkish? (Featured single origin espresso at the roaster I bought it at)
Single Origin.   
Region: Berti Yergacheffe 
Heirloom Washed.  
Elevation: 2300M
Days since roast: 25

Equipment:
- Timemore 64s
- Magnetic indicator for 64s (bought off Etsy once I realized how annoying the 64s side indicator with front numbers are... The magnet kind of wiggles though, but Im pretty meticulous about *trying* to put it back in the exact same position.  might have to glue it down).
- Gaggia Classic e24
- Norcore bottomless portafilter with stock 18g normcore basket 
- 85mm paper filters
- Nomrcore .3mm puckscreen
- mwh3 blind shaker + dosing funnel
- Normcore v4 self leveling tamper @25 lbs
- tiny RDT sprayer (came with my dosing cup from mwh3) 
-  bookoo themis scale

Workflow:
0.) preheat machine for .5 to 1.5 hours (I have it on a smart switch for a scheduled time start). 
1.) measure out 18.1ish beans and pick out any blondes/cracked beans
2.) RDT 2-4 times and shake, let rest to absorb 2ish mins while I prep everything else
3.) hot start and slow pour beans in to grinder. Grinding into blind shaker at max rpm (I've never timed it, but I often pour in my beans slow enough that my grinder sometimes shuts off as I'm about to finish: it's kind of annoying)
4). Wipe out portafilter and basket (which I leave resting in machine to warm up), adding in paper filter, spray to make paper filter flat on Bottom of basket. Put on dosing funnel. Place on scale and tare.
5.) shake beans in shaker using elliptical motions motions switching directions to make sure properly shaken.
6.)  Drop coffee into portal filter and weight on scale
7.) give portafilter a couple of gentle taps on side to even, then place flat on counter and tamp twice, (test to make sure it clears group head and no indent if needed), then place puck screen
8.) Purge water from machine, waiting brew light to turn on, then purging all water until off.
9.) wipe down group head + drip tray, place Portafilter, scale, and glass
10.) Wait 10 seconds after brew light goes on then hit brew switch + start button on scale.
11.) clean basket with sponge, soap, water, Making sure dish soap penetrate through holes, checking no visible obstructions against light when done.

So far here are my results on my 7 shots pulled today (using beanconquerer to track things): 
1.) 2.5 Clicks. In: 17.9g. Out: 40g in 10 seconds. Medium heavy channeling squirt on side. Under extracted. Vegetal and flat.
2.) 2.1 clicks. in: 17.7g. out: Choked.
3.) 2.25 clcks. in: 17.9g. out: choked.
4.) 2.38 clicks. In: 18.3g. out:  choked.
5.) 2.48 clicks. In: 17.8g. out: 38.1g in 55s. Slight vegetal, flat. No toast notes
6.) 2.51 clicks. In: 18.1g. Out: Choked
7.) 2.48 clicks. In 18.1g. Out 37g in 26s. Channeling.
Super Fine mist spray from side. Nice High floral notes. Slight vegetal. Nice pop of acid. Slight hint of toast in back. Not as balanced/nuanced as shot at roaster. May try for higher temp.

I'm kind of confused as to why this bag in particular has been such an absolute struggle.

I'm *still* not sure if 2.48ish clicks will work the next time I try it....

The other bags I've done I've gotten within 2 or 3 pulls and pretty much all of them (be it the super dark and oiley espresso blend, or the medium light roasted tyouca-burbon blend) were pretty rock solid and consistent once dialed in, and all of them were around 1.7 to 2.1.ish clicks.

Why is this one in particular such an outlier and why is it seemingly so temperamental to compared to the other coffees?  

Is there anything in my process that leaves question?
Is this common to Ethiopian beans?  
Is it just this specific batch/bag of beans?   

I'm pretty new to coffee and trying to understand what's going on.

Any advice is appreciated! Thanks.

P.s. if anyone has any advice for how to make the blind shaker less likely to retain, id appreciate it. I usually measure out 18.1g in beans (18.3 with water) and end up with 17.9 in my Portafilter. The grinder itself might sometimes keep .1g, but the dosing cup itself definitely seem to keep .1+g as well.

It was worse before I started to rdt, but when I do more than 4 sprays, it helps with the dosing cup, but then i start to notice wet grounds end up caking up against the sidewalls of my grinder instead.",1,1759346774.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

This year, I finally committed to attending community college and it’s been one of the best decisions I’ve made.

There’s this girl in my English class who always sat behind me. Honestly, I was super intimidated by her at first. She seemed really confident and I thought she’d think I was awkward. But one day after class, I pushed myself to start a conversation, and to my surprise, she was kind, patient, and didn’t judge me at all.

Later on, we ended up being paired for a group project. We worked together in the library, and when we finished, I gathered the courage to ask if she wanted to grab a coffee at a nearby cafe. She said yes, and we had such a nice time. At the end, I felt brave enough to kiss her on the cheek. I asked if she’d like to go on a proper date sometime. She smiled and said yes!

I can’t explain how excited and nervous I am. I’ve never really had this kind of experience before, and it feels surreal that someone I thought was out of my league actually wants to spend time with me. Our date is coming up soon and I just can’t stop smiling about it.

The Miss Mouth's MM-1B10W Stain Remover certainly made its mark on my daily life, pun intended. As someone who lives with a messy toddler, endless coffee spills, and the occasional wine accident, a reliable stain remover isn’t just a luxury—it’s a necessity. Knowing this product is widely acclaimed (ranked #30 in Laundry Stain Removers, to boot) added to my curiosity to test every claim it makes. What really drew me in was its promises: quick action, versatility, and safety, all packed into a 4-ounce bottle with bonus wipes. Surely, it couldn’t be as magical as it’s marketed to be... right?

**Compact Design, Big Impact**

This product’s design genuinely impressed me. The 4-ounce spray bottle feels compact and travel-friendly, fitting easily in my purse or even a diaper bag during outings. At first glance, it seems unassuming, but that’s where it takes you by surprise. The bottle is ergonomically shaped, so even on busy, clumsy hands (ahem, like mine), it’s simple to use. Besides the spray, the inclusion of wipes makes it even more adaptable. I've pulled these out in restaurants, playgrounds, and even my car after an unfortunate ketchup-related mishap. These extras ensure you never feel unprepared for life’s messiest moments.

[See Miss Mouth's MM-1B10W deals on Amazon now.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b07qw4942t/)

**Easy Application Process**

Using this stain remover is a breeze. The instructions are straightforward: spray, blot, rinse, and watch the stain disappear. It felt almost therapeutic seeing fresh stains lift almost instantly. I tested it on typical culprits like baby food, fruit juice, and coffee. Removing set-in stains required a little more elbow grease, but the results were visibly satisfying. A coffee stain on my cream-colored couch vanished completely after two uses. My work blouses have been rescued from formula spit-up disasters, and it was a lifesaver during potty-training accidents.

**Key Benefits**

- EPA-certified for safety, offering peace of mind while using it around children and pets.
- Works effectively on both fresh and old stains, from food and beverages to blood and grease.
- The compact size and included wipes provide convenience at home and on the go.
- Biodegradability makes it environmentally friendly in addition to being efficient.

**Negatives**

- The small 4-ounce bottle, while portable, tends to get used up quickly in a busy household.
- Removing tougher, older stains sometimes calls for repeated applications, which can take time.
- A slightly overpowering scent upon application, though it dissipates after use.

**Boons of the Formula**

The standout feature here is the safety certification. Being EPA Safer Choice certified genuinely sets this stain remover apart in a crowded market. Its biodegradable properties and non-toxic ingredients mean I didn’t have to stress when my kiddo got curious and grabbed the spray bottle. It also worked wonders on my son’s baby clothes—it breathed new life into items that seemed destined for the trash or donation pile.

**Market Rivals**

Considering the sea of competition within laundry and stain removal products, Miss Mouth's Stain Remover surprisingly holds its own. Compared to Tide To Go pens, this product’s coverage feels superior, especially for tougher and dried-in stains. Brands like Shout and OxiClean offer spray-based products too; however, they often lack the portability and immediate versatility of included disposable wipes. Where this remover falls slightly behind is in the quantity per bottle—something larger families or heavy users might consider when switching from other brands.

**Affordable Quality**

When assessing the price-to-quality ratio, this product comfortably justifies what you pay for it. It’s not the cheapest option out there, nor the most expensive, but its performance earns every dollar. Investing in a product that saves clothing from permanent stains or hefty dry-cleaning bills actually feels like a form of financial efficiency. Not every stain remover balances safety, portability, and effectiveness, but this one excels in all three departments.

Here's a pattern we hear about all the time when we talk with RISE users about why they first downloaded the app: Poor sleep leads to grogginess in the morning, which leads to reaching for coffee to get through the day. That caffeine lingers longer than most people realize, disrupting sleep that night. The next morning, the exhaustion is even worse, leading to more coffee... and the cycle continues.

Some people tell us they were adding alcohol at night to ""take the edge off"" and finally fall asleep, which made things worse again: caffeine interferes with natural sleep signals, while alcohol fragments and suppresses restorative sleep. It's an easy trap to slip into and hard to dig out from.

**Breaking the cycle with a caffeine cutoff**

The **Caffeine Cutoff Reminder** has become one of our community's most loved (and love-hated) features, and for good reason. Having a personalized caffeine cutoff is one of the most powerful tools for breaking out of this pattern, making a real difference in both sleep quality and next-day energy.

*(Scroll to the end for quick directions on how to set yours up if you haven't already.)*

**Why we're diving deep on this**

To put our cards on the table: most of us on the RISE team are pretty serious about our coffee, constantly taste-testing new roasts and tinkering with different brewing techniques. And beyond taste, there's no denying caffeine's benefits when you've built up sleep debt—it sharpens focus, lifts mood, and helps you power through.

That said, the effects of caffeine on sleep are more far-reaching—and often more subtle—than most people realize. Our hope is that by laying out the science, you'll have a better understanding of why the reminder matters so much and have a better sense of when to adjust your cutoff based on what's happening in your life, so you can keep enjoying your coffee without it keeping you up at night.

**Why do we recommend a caffeine cutoff?**

**In a nutshell:** caffeine kicks in fast but lingers much longer than most of us think. Even a small amount left in your system at bedtime can disrupt your sleep, blocking the natural sleepiness signal your body relies on to drift off. The next morning, you wake up groggy, reach for more coffee, and repeat the cycle. A personal cutoff time tied to your melatonin window breaks that loop by giving your body enough hours for enough caffeine to clear before bed.

**Adenosine: the shared currency of sleep and caffeine**

It all comes down to **adenosine**. This compound builds up in your brain while you're awake, creating *sleep pressure* — the rising drive to sleep as the day goes on. When you get enough sleep at night, your brain clears out that adenosine, resetting the balance for the next day. But if you cut sleep short, you carry leftover adenosine into tomorrow, stacking on top of the new buildup. That carryover is a big part of what you're feeling when you've got **sleep debt**.

Caffeine's trick is blocking adenosine receptors, masking the sleepiness signal. That's why it can make you feel alert when you're underslept — but also why lingering caffeine at night sabotages the process that restores balance. Adenosine is the crux of the caffeine–sleep tension: you need it to build and clear normally, while caffeine works by getting in the way. Respecting your cutoff keeps those forces in balance.

**How long caffeine sticks around**

Blood levels of caffeine peak within an hour (that's when you feel it ""hit""), and from then your liver slowly metabolizes it over many hours.

For most people, caffeine *drops by half* in about 3 to 7 hours, but the range is wide: as short as 2 hours for some, or up to 12–18 for others.

Using an average 5-hour half-life, a 16-ounce Starbucks Grande Pike Place coffee (\~310 mg caffeine!) at 2 p.m. breaks down like this:

* 7 p.m. (5 hours later): \~155 mg left
* Midnight (10 hours later): \~78 mg left
* 5 a.m. (15 hours later): \~39 mg left

For slow metabolizers, that same coffee could leave 155 mg still active at midnight — nearly three shots of espresso! — and measurable caffeine well into the next day.

**Why clearance differs so widely**

How caffeine affects you depends on both biology and context:

* **Genetics:** The liver enzyme **CYP1A2** determines how quickly you metabolize caffeine. Fast metabolizers may halve caffeine in 2 to 4 hours, while slow metabolizers can take 8 to 10 hours or more. A separate gene, **ADORA2A**, influences how sensitive you feel — whether caffeine calms you, makes you jittery, or disrupts your sleep — even if clearance speed is normal.
* **Hormones:** Oral contraceptives roughly double the time caffeine lingers. Rising estrogen mid-cycle or in the luteal phase also slows clearance. During pregnancy, clearance may extend to 10 to 18 hours by the third trimester.
* **Age:** As liver blood flow decreases with age, caffeine leaves the system more slowly.
* **Smoking:** Chemicals in smoke speed up caffeine metabolism, nearly cutting the time it stays in your system in half.
* **Medications:** SSRIs such as fluvoxamine slow clearance significantly. ADHD stimulants do not change clearance, but they stack with caffeine's effects, leading to stronger stimulation. GLP-1 drugs slow absorption, so the buzz arrives later, though clearance is unchanged. Sildenafil and isotretinoin do not meaningfully affect clearance.
* **Time of day:** Your body clears caffeine faster in the morning and slower in the evening.
* **Diet and alcohol:** Cruciferous vegetables and char-grilled meats can speed up clearance. Grapefruit juice can slow it down. Occasional alcohol slows caffeine breakdown, while heavy long-term use speeds it up.

**How caffeine disrupts sleep**

Caffeine's slow breakdown in the body — and the wide differences in how slow that process can be — matters because even small amounts left in your system at bedtime can profoundly disrupt sleep. Research shows it increases sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep), causes more wake-ups during the night, and reduces sleep efficiency (how much of your time in bed is spent actually sleeping). These effects add up to less total sleep time, preventing your brain from fully clearing adenosine and allowing sleep debt to accumulate.

Caffeine also alters sleep architecture, reducing both slow-wave sleep (deep sleep) and REM sleep, the stages most responsible for recovery, learning, and mood regulation. These background changes make the sleep you do get less restorative — even if you don't feel wired, struggle to fall asleep, or remember waking up during the night.

**How to set up your Caffeine Cutoff Reminder**

*Not using RISE yet? You can download it with 7 days free via the widget in our sub sidebar.*

**To set it up:**

* Tools → Habit Reminders → Caffeine
* Toggle ON
* Set reminder time (default: 10 hrs before melatonin window; adjust earlier if needed)
* Choose notification type — push (default) or text (US/Canada)

In addition to a daily push notification (and on Apple Watch if you use one), you'll also see your cutoff on the Energy tab's daily schedule. And if you explore our new Guidance tab, you'll find plenty of fresh caffeine-related insights waiting there too.

To note, our reminder is for awareness and accountability. Given all the factors that shape clearance, we give conservative guidance using the best data we have. RISE will keep getting smarter, but it can't capture everything yet — so use the reminder as your baseline, then nudge it earlier or later based on how your sleep and energy respond.",1,1759346568.0,riseapp,0,1.0,False

1nvhnmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nvhnmi/blackwood_has_no_womenpart_1/,Blackwood Has No Women(Part 1).,"If you’re reading this, I’m already dead. Right now, I’m climbing the spiral staircase to the topmost floor of the lighthouse at the edge of town. When I reach the lantern room, I’ll throw myself to the jagged rocks below. Better to be claimed by the sea than enslaved to that thing.

I am a 56-year-old man from a small seaside town in California called Blackwood. For the safety of my family, I dare not reveal my name. From this point on, I will only be known as Anon.

It was July of 1983, and I was fourteen — an age when most boys were sneaking beers at parties, chasing pretty girls, and fumbling toward their first real kisses.

But not in Blackwood.

Blackwood wasn’t like other towns on the California coast. The beaches were the same, the salt wind the same, but the people… they were relics, clinging to ideas long buried elsewhere. The town was damn near puritan. No music blasting from boomboxes at sunrise. No neon glow of arcades. No posters of Madonna or Michael Jackson. Even the games in our rec center were years behind — old Atari cabinets with pixelated beeps instead of roars.

Everything in Blackwood had a place. Every boy, every girl, a role. Boys were drilled in toughness, silence, obedience. Girls… well, girls were sent away to a special school, learning God-knows-what while we were left to stumble blind. I had never seen a girl older than eleven.

I grew up without a mother. My father was a deadbeat alcoholic who spent more time on the bar stools than at home. I hated him. My childhood smelled of stale beer, cigarette smoke, and the kind of silence that makes your skin crawl.

That day, I was with my friends at the abandoned café by the pier. Its windows were boarded, its paint peeling, the walls thick with mildew and old coffee — but it was ours. We passed a bottle of cheap beer around, laughing, killing time.

“Dude, this arcade game’s garbage,” muttered Vince, nudging the battered console Tommy had smuggled out of his garage. “I know,” I said, taking a swig. “It’s all just pixels. Who even likes these things?” “Your mom?” Tommy grinned. “Shut up,” I shot back, though I was laughing too.

We joked about girls we’d never had, movies we’d never sneak into, dares we’d never take. For a while, we felt free.

Then came the sirens.

Two patrol cars screeched to a halt outside, red and blue lights painting the café walls. “Shit,” Vince muttered, staring at the boarded windows as though they’d suddenly gone transparent.

The cops stormed in, flashlights slicing through the dark. “Everybody out! Now!”

We froze. Then bolted. Predictably, we didn’t make it far.

The night ended at the Blackwood police station.

“Why were you there?” the officer barked. “Trespassing. Underage drinking. You know the rules.”

We sat slouched in hard chairs, reeking of sweat and cheap beer. I tried to look bored, but my eyes wandered — and that’s when I saw her.

A girl. My age, maybe fourteen. Blonde. And pregnant. A belly no one that young should have. Her skin was pale, her eyes sunken, shadowed, like she hadn’t slept in weeks.

I whispered something crude under my breath, because that’s what boys do when confronted with the impossible.

And then she stared at me. Not at anyone else. Me. Her gaze burned through me as she walked forward.

“GET OUT!” she screamed.

I jolted upright, nearly leaping from the chair. The room spun.

The cop’s voice cut through the panic. “Hey! Sit down, kid. You fell asleep on me. Quit nodding off.”

I swallowed hard, my pulse hammering. The girl — gone, of course. Just a dream, I told myself. Just a dream. But the terror lingered.

This is the first woman I have ever seen. I never had a mother. I have never seen a woman past the age of eleven. After eleven, they just… disappear. There are no explanations, no reports. Just gone. It is as if the entire town chooses to forget they exist.

I questioned it when I was younger. It never went well. I was either gaslit into believing they never existed, or my dad would beat the foolishness out of me. And I went along with it. We were taught blind obedience from the cradle. So I learned not to question him. Or anything.

That night, I came home to chaos. My father stood waiting in the kitchen, a bottle in one hand, a belt in the other. His face red, twisted, drunk.

“You think you can wander off, drinking beer like some damn fool? Do you know how much trouble you’ve caused me, boy?” Spittle flew with every word.

I tried to explain, but he cut me off. “Don’t you dare open your mouth! You’ll learn respect the hard way.”

The belt cracked — once on the floor, then across my arm, then my back. Pain bloomed like fire. I didn’t scream. I never did. Not then, not ever.

“You’re nothing without me, boy! Remember that!”

When he finally stumbled off to drown himself in whiskey, I crawled to my room. My body throbbed, my ears rang, and her face wouldn’t leave me. The girl. Pale. Hollow-eyed. Pregnant. Her gaze burning through me.

Sleep came late, and when it did, it betrayed me.

I had no body, no face. I drifted above Blackwood like a shadow. The streets stretched endlessly. The small, square library pulled at me like a magnet.

Inside, the floor gaped open. A vast hole yawned in the center, blacker than night. From it rose whispers. All female voices — young, old, every age, every accent. Some soft, some sharp, some that seemed centuries old. They beckoned, pulling me closer.

I floated at the edge. Peered down. Saw nothing but endless dark.

And then I saw her.

The woman. Not a girl. Not a shadow. Flesh and bone and terror. She wore a hospital gown, its hem dark with dried blood. Her long black hair whipped in a phantom wind. Her skin was gaunt, death-pale. She stared at me, eyes burning with the same unnatural intensity.

“Row 15,” she rasped. Her voice cracked, echoing, layered with a thousand tones. “Bottom row…”

I tried to answer, to scream, but I had no mouth. Only thought. Only dread pressing into me like deep water.

Then I woke. Shaking. Sweating. The faint glow of a streetlight bleeding through my window.

Her words lingered. *Row 15. Bottom row.*

I didn’t know what it meant. I didn’t know what she wanted. I only knew that sleep had betrayed me, my town held secrets darker than anyone dared admit, and for the first time in my life, I felt utterly, irrevocably… alone.

The morning after that dream, I wanted nothing more than to scrub it out of my memory. I clung to routine like a life raft. Wake up, dress in the same jeans I’d worn two days straight, choke down burnt toast, and ride my bike through the misty streets toward Blackwood High.

The air smelled of salt and tar from the pier, the kind of briny sharpness that clung to your clothes long after you’d come inside. Seagulls wheeled overhead, crying at one another, and the gray clouds never seemed to move. Blackwood always felt frozen, like a painting that refused to dry.

School looked like it always did: squat, box-shaped, bricks mottled with salt stains. The flag out front sagged heavily and limply, never flying, just hanging there like a reminder of something long past.

My friends were already waiting by the bike racks, kicking at gravel, huddled in the damp morning like a pack of strays. Vince was chewing sunflower seeds and spitting shells into the dirt. Tommy had his denim jacket on despite the heat. Ricky looked like he hadn’t slept at all — but that was just his face. He always looked tired, like he was born that way.

“Dude,” Vince said as soon as I rolled up, “my old man nearly skinned me alive. I’m on lockdown until graduation.”

“Graduation?” Tommy laughed, bumping him with an elbow. “Try ‘til Jesus comes back.’”

Ricky smirked. “At least you guys just got punished. My dad gave me the sermon. Hour-long lecture about responsibility, about being a man, about ‘honor.’ I’d rather he just beat me and get it over with.”

I shrugged, forcing my voice to sound casual. “Yeah. Same here. My old man… You know.”

They did know. I never had to explain. The subject dropped, like it always did.

The day rolled on in the dull rhythm of Blackwood High. Math, history, English — all taught in classrooms that smelled faintly of chalk and seawater. The paint on the walls peeled like sunburnt skin. The clocks ticked louder than the teachers spoke.

Tommy got caught doodling rocket ships again and had to stay after class. Vince nearly started a fight with a sophomore over a bent quarter for the soda machine. Ricky fell asleep in the study hall, head tipped back, mouth open like he’d given up on pretending. And me? I laughed at their jokes. I nodded along. I tried to be present.

But underneath it all, something was gnawing at the back of my mind.

It wasn’t a voice exactly. Not words. More like the feeling of being watched, or the pressure in your ears when you dive too deep. A hum at the edge of thought. And sometimes, when I wasn’t looking for it, the hum turned into a whisper. A direction. A pull.

Row 15. Bottom row.

I shook my head. Tried to focus on Vince’s story about sneaking into the theater to watch Return of the Jedi again. Tried to laugh at Tommy making fun of the new arcade machine at the rec center — “it’s like watching a brick jump, man!” Tried to sip the warm Coke from the cafeteria and let it fizz across my tongue.

But the compulsion was always there. A tug in the back of my skull, soft but constant. Like a hook in the water, pulling me closer, closer.

By the final bell, I was exhausted. Not just tired — worn down, like I’d been carrying bricks all day. The effort it took to push the thought back every time it surfaced left me heavy-limbed, head thick with fog.

I rode my bike home slowly, the tires crunching over gravel, my body on autopilot. When I finally staggered into the living room, the silence of the house wrapped around me. My father was gone — likely at the bar. For once, I was grateful.

I didn’t bother with homework. Didn’t bother with food. I just dropped onto the couch, my bag sliding to the floor. The cushions smelled faintly of beer and smoke, like everything else in that house.

The whisper still scratched at me, faint now, as though it knew I was resisting. But I pushed it down one last time. My body felt leaden. I closed my eyes.

And sleep swallowed me whole.

When I woke, it wasn’t in my living room.

It was dark. Too dark. The kind of dark that felt solid, pressing against your eyes even when they were open. For a moment, I thought I was still dreaming. My head throbbed, my limbs ached.

I sat up with a groan and hissed through my teeth. Stinging fire lit across my chest and arms. When I reached down, my fingers came away wet. Sticky. Warm. Blood.

Cold night air slid through broken glass somewhere above me, making the cuts sting worse. Moonlight bled in through a jagged window, a pale silver slash that cut across rows of shelves.

The smell hit me next: dust, mold, old paper.

The library.

I staggered to my feet, glass crunching under my shoes. My shirt clung to me, wet with blood. Cuts ran down my arms like I’d clawed through brambles. But I had no memory of coming here. No memory of breaking in.

And then, beneath the ringing in my ears, I heard it.

Not from outside. Not from inside. From everywhere.

Row 15. Bottom row.

The voice wasn’t louder this time. It was clearer.

And I knew, with the certainty of a nightmare you can’t shake, that I wasn’t leaving the library until I found it.

The library looked different at night. During the day it was a sad, aging building — yellowed windows, a leaky roof, the kind of place teachers forced you to visit for book reports. But now, in the wash of moonlight, it seemed older, almost ancient, like it had been here long before the town itself.

Shadows stretched across the carpet, long and warped. The air was damp, thick with the scent of salt and rot, as though the sea had crept in and settled among the shelves.

My shoes crunched over broken glass as I moved, every sound too loud, bouncing off the high ceiling. I didn’t dare breathe too heavy. My cuts stung with every step, warm blood soaking through my shirt.

And underneath it all, the whisper.

row 15… bottom row…

It wasn’t in my ears. It wasn’t in the room. It was inside me, vibrating in my ribs, threaded through my pulse. Every time I thought I could ignore it, it sharpened, pulling my thoughts back like a leash.

The shelves loomed around me, tall, endless. Numbers stenciled in faded white paint marked the ends of rows. My eyes darted from one to the next. Eleven… twelve… thirteen…

The deeper I went, the darker it got. The moonlight only reached so far. Past the tenth row, I had to move by memory and the faint outline of shelves against deeper black. The smell changed too — less like dust, more like… mildew. Like something damp had been sitting here for years, festering.

Row fourteen.

I froze. My breath hitched. For a moment, everything was silent.

Then a creak.

Wood shifting. Not behind me. Not ahead. Somewhere between. The sound of weight settling on old boards.

“Hello?” My voice was too small, swallowed by the stacks.

Silence.

I forced myself forward, my hand grazing the edge of the shelves to keep steady. My fingers brushed over the spines of books, stiff and sticky with damp, their titles unreadable in the dark.

And then — there it was.

Row fifteen.

My chest tightened. The whisper surged, flooding my head until it was all I could hear.

bottom row… bottom row… bottom row…

I knelt, my knees popping against the thin carpet. The bottom shelf sat half in shadow, the wood warped and soft from water damage. Most of the books there looked ruined — swollen, mold-eaten, their pages fused.

But one… one was different.

A thin black volume, its spine unmarked, wedged between two rotting dictionaries. It didn’t look wet. Didn’t look old. It looked new, like someone had placed it there just for me.

My hand trembled as I reached for it. The instant my fingertips brushed the cover, the air around me shifted. Colder. Heavier. The silence thickened until I could hear only my own heartbeat hammering.

I pulled the book free. The leather cover was slick, clammy, as though it had been pulled from water only moments ago. No title. No author. Just black.

And then, faint but undeniable, a sound.

Breathing.

Not mine.

Slow. Ragged. Coming from the other side of the shelf.

The book sat heavy in my hands, colder than it had any right to be. The leather cover stuck faintly to my palms, as though it were sweating. For a long moment, I just knelt there, crouched in the dark, listening to the breathing on the other side of the shelf.

Inhale.

Exhale.

A sound too steady to be an accident.

I squeezed my eyes shut, willing it away. It had to be in my head. Just the blood loss, the exhaustion, the dream still leaking into reality. When I opened my eyes again, the sound had stopped.

But the silence wasn’t any better.

My pulse thudded in my ears as I staggered to my feet. The book weighed down my arm like an anchor, pulling me back toward the shelf, but I refused to open it. Not yet. I shoved it under my arm and forced myself down the row, each step dragging.

The shelves towered over me like walls. My shoulder brushed them as I walked, and dust rained down in little cascades. The air was damp, heavy, and I swore it thickened the deeper I went.

At the end of the row, I turned sharply, moving toward the exit. My body screamed to get out. My mind screamed louder. Just leave. Toss the thing. Pretend it never happened. Forget.

But every step forward was harder than the last. My legs trembled. My cuts throbbed. It felt like I was walking against a current, like the library itself was holding me back.

I stopped, panting, gripping the book to my chest. The urge to throw it — to just hurl it into the dark and run — burned in me. My arm even twitched with the motion.

And then, faint as a sigh, the whisper returned.

…row 15… bottom row…

My stomach lurched. The voice wasn’t around me this time. It came from the book. Vibrating through the leather cover into my bones.

I dropped it.

The sound was louder than it should have been, a hollow thud that echoed through the stacks. Dust spiraled upward. My hands shook as though they’d touched something electric.

Silence followed. A long, suffocating silence.

And then — the breathing again. Closer now.

I spun around, heart hammering, but the row behind me was empty. Nothing but books and shadows. No footsteps, no movement. Just me.

My chest heaved. My cuts burned. My body screamed for the door, but my eyes… my eyes wouldn’t leave the book on the floor.

It lay there, black cover catching the thin blade of moonlight. Waiting.

I took a step toward it. Then another. My breath came ragged, shallow. Each step sounded too loud. The carpet muffled nothing.

Kneeling again, I reached out, fingers trembling. The leather was cold as ice when I touched it, colder than before.

My hand hovered over the edge of the cover. My body felt split in two — one half desperate to flee, the other compelled, dragged by invisible hooks.

And then the whisper returned, not faint this time, not soft.

OPEN IT.

The sound wasn’t outside. It was inside. Rattling through my skull, pressing against my teeth, vibrating down my spine.

I froze, paralyzed between terror and inevitability, staring at the unmarked cover, knowing that once I did, there would be no going back.

My thumb slipped under the cover, and for a heartbeat I swore the leather pulsed — not like dead hide, but like something still living. Still breathing. I almost tore my hand back, but the whisper hooked into me, pulling me down.

*Open it.*

The cover peeled back with a faint, wet crackle, like skin tearing from scabs.

The first page was blank. Yellowed, spotted with mold. I turned another. Blank again. My breath came short. Ten, twelve pages in — still empty.

Then the ink appeared.

Thin, black strokes spidered across the page in lines and curves too sharp, too fluid. They weren’t words, not in any language I knew. Not English, not Spanish, not even the Latin phrases priests sometimes muttered when they visited our school. These shapes bent in ways that made my eyes water. Some jagged as broken bones. Others coiled like worms gnawing through the paper itself.

I couldn’t read it, but I *understood* something all the same.

And that’s when the room shifted.

The air grew heavy, thick with pressure, like the deep ocean had folded itself around me. My ears popped. My vision warped, colors leeching until only black and white remained. My stomach clenched, a rope twisting my guts tighter and tighter.

Then the nausea hit.

My throat filled with rot. I gagged, slammed to my hands and knees, and vomited violently. What came up was thin, yellow sludge, steaming as it hit the carpet. It reeked of sulfur, a rancid egg-stink that clawed at my sinuses and made my eyes burn.

I kept retching long after my stomach emptied, each heave wracking my chest, until finally I collapsed, face sinking into the foul puddle.

The moment my cheek touched it, the darkness rushed in.

When I woke, I was in my bed.

Sunlight pressed against the curtains, pale and thin. My sheets clung damp to my skin. For a moment I thought I had dreamed it, that I’d never left my house, never opened the book.

Then I felt the weight in my hand.

I looked down.

The book lay against my chest, my fingers locked in a death-grip around its spine. The leather was slick and clammy, colder than the air. My knuckles ached as I pried them loose, one by one, until the thing thudded onto the sheets beside me.

But that wasn’t the worst part.

Across the fabric of my shirt, smeared over my chest and stomach, were black marks. Symbols. The same jagged curves and crooked hooks from the book’s pages, written in ink that hadn’t been there the night before. They shimmered faintly, as though wet, and when I leaned close, I could smell the same sulfur stink rising from them.

I tore the shirt off and hurled it across the room. It landed in a heap, but the marks didn’t fade. They seemed to pulse faintly in the sunlight, like embers that refused to die.

I pressed a hand to my bare chest. The skin underneath was hot, raw, as if the symbols had burned straight through the cloth into me.

The book sat perfectly still beside me, its cover blank, its spine unmarked.

But I knew — with a certainty that hollowed me out — that it had branded me. That whatever had whispered from its pages had seeped through my eyes, my veins, my bones.

And though the house was empty, though the morning air was still, I swear I could feel it.

Something breathing.

Not around me.

*Inside me.*

The next day stretched on like a dream folded wrong. Every hallway, every classroom, every locker-lined corridor felt thicker, heavier, as if the air itself had weight. I could feel it pressing down on my shoulders, tightening around my ribs.

The staring began immediately, subtle at first. I’d glance up from my notebook or lift my eyes in the hall, and nothing seemed unusual. A friend passing, a teacher at the board, a classmate laughing at a joke — normal. But the moment I looked away, the weight of awareness returned.

Eyes. Always eyes. Watching me when I wasn’t looking.

I could sense them in my peripheral vision, tracing me like invisible hands, waiting for me to turn my back. It didn’t matter where I was — the cafeteria, the gym hallway, even the stairwell. The sensation was omnipresent.

By lunch, my skin itched with awareness. I sat with Vince, Tommy, and Ricky, trying to focus on fries that tasted like chalk, pretending the buzzing in my skull wasn’t there. Their chatter felt distant, as if the world around me had become a thin film separating me from reality.

I laughed at a joke Vince made, but the sound didn’t match his mouth moving. I shook my head, trying to clear it.

Then I noticed something.

In the reflection of the metal water fountain near the gym, something moved behind me. I froze mid-step, throat tight. The warped silver surface showed… a face. Not Vince, not Tommy. Not human. Black eyes that filled the face, impossibly wide, with long gray hair spilling over shoulders too thin, and a smile stretched far beyond what any human mouth could hold. It was meant to be welcoming — warm — but every corner of it screamed wrong.

I snapped my attention around.

Vince was there, leaning lazily against the locker. Just Vince.

“Whoa, man! You okay?” he said, voice tight with concern. “You look… pale.”

I swallowed hard, fumbling for words. “Yeah. Fine. Just… tired, I guess.”

He didn’t look convinced. “You’re shaking. Seriously, something’s wrong.”

I forced a smile, messy and broken. “I’m fine. Really.”

But the world wasn’t fine.

Everywhere I went that afternoon, it was the same. The weight on my shoulders, the prickle at the back of my neck, the invisible stare. Even when friends were beside me, I felt the pull of unknown eyes digging into my back.

And then I heard it.

Not from anyone. Not from anywhere outside me.

*Nephilim.*

The word vibrated through my bones. I couldn’t localize it — not the room, not the lockers, not the ceiling. Just *inside*. The sound was impossible, resonant, like metal twisting under a black tide.

I gasped, my stomach tightening, and my vision blurred. For a heartbeat, the hallways stretched, the walls bending, lockers twisting, the faces around me elongating, hollowing, eyes widening beyond humanity. Even Vince, walking beside me, seemed to flicker, as if his skin was a thin mask over something older, something wrong.

I gripped the water fountain, letting the cold metal anchor me. My head spun. The word whispered again, not with sound, but with weight. *Nephilim.*

1nvhms3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nvhms3/aita_for_refusing_to_serve_a_student_who_creeps/,"AITA for refusing to serve a student who creeps me out, even though my supervisor says I’m being discriminatory?","I (F, early 30s, Asian) work at an educational institute in the Netherlands that provides various language and other hobby courses for adults, specifically retired elderly people. Recently, I’ve been having serious issues with one of our older students, let’s call him *Jan* (M, 60s). His behavior toward me has gone from awkward to creepy to downright intimidating, and I no longer feel safe around him. He's also a long-term student at this institution, and 2 of my colleagues, including my supervisor, know him quite well. (This is important for later.)

Here are some examples of Jan's behavior towards me:

* **Open Day:** I was alone downstairs managing registrations while everyone else was upstairs. Jan stood at the bar with his dirty coffee cup and refused to just leave it there. I told him several times that he could leave it, but he just stood there watching me, calling me to take it, waiting for me. This happened three or four times before he finally left. It felt like he was testing how long he could hold my attention.
* **Course registration day:** He insisted on shaking my hand and stood uncomfortably close while doing it. He then made a racist remark about my name, saying it was “weird” that I have a Dutch name, even though I’m Asian. He went on to compare me to an Asian woman he knew who “obviously had an Asian name.” He kept making comments about Asian women in general and came to stand right next to my chair while I was working. He also kept insisting I find him a bookstore where he could buy the course textbook, even after I told him repeatedly that he had to order it online. He claimed he had no internet at home and basically demanded I “help him.” (Later, I found out he *does* have internet, so he was just making excuses to keep me serving him.)
* **His 1st lesson day:** He came more than half an hour before his class and sat directly across the lobby from me, staring at me the entire time I was working. He then waited until I was completely alone before approaching me and standing right next to my chair. He started complaining loudly that I had given him the wrong information about the book, demanding that I “give him credit” for his effort. I told him again what I’d told him before, but he kept repeating himself and raising his voice. Then he asked to borrow a pen, which I gave him. Later, instead of leaving it at the desk, he insisted on returning the pen specifically to me, even sending my colleague to fetch me so he could return the pen to me, as if he needed another excuse to force interaction.

Two of my colleagues, Jan's teacher and the one who came to fetch me on Jan's request, witnessed parts of this and agreed with me that Jan's behavior was creepy. Jan's teacher even said it was obvious that Jan was treating me differently from others because I’m a younger Asian woman. My other colleague called him a creep for specifically asking for me just to return the damn pen.

Another colleague, Carol (F, 50s, white Dutch), who also knows Jan, was shocked when I described the incidents to her. She said Jan never stares at her, never crowds her space, and never raises his voice. She said it was clear he was trying to intimidate me. She even offered to swap shifts with me so I wouldn’t have to be there when Jan has class.

But here’s where things get worse. I reported everything to my supervisor, Kees (M, 60s). Instead of supporting me, Kees told me that I was being “too sensitive” and that Jan treats everyone the same. He actually accused me of being *discriminatory* against Jan because “he’s different” and “most likely has mental issues.” He insisted that I continue treating him politely and serving him, as if nothing was wrong. He only agreed to the schedule swap after Carol herself backed me up, not because of my report.

And then, as if to mock me, Kees said, “Well, you won’t have nightmares now, right?” as though this was all a joke.

For context: I’ve faced discrimination and harassment my whole life. One of the most traumatic experiences I had was years ago in my old apartment building. I was waiting for the elevator when two older women stepped out with a disabled teenage boy. Out of nowhere, he lunged at me and grabbed my breasts with so much force that I was in pain for two days. The women pulled him back and apologized, but he kept struggling to reach for me again. I was left in shock, helpless and violated. His disability may have explained why it happened, but it didn’t erase the violation, the pain, or the trauma.

So when Kees accused me of being “discriminatory” toward Jan because I don’t want to keep being subjected to his intimidation and creepy behavior, it cut me to the core. It felt like I was back in that elevator, being told that what happened to me doesn’t count because the person was “different.” That I don’t get to have boundaries or safety.

Now I’ve decided that I will not serve Jan anymore. If he comes in, I’ll walk away. But Kees clearly resents me for it, and I can’t stop replaying his words in my head that I’m being discriminatory, too sensitive, and that Jan “wouldn’t hurt a fly.”

We have gone the to her house the last several years for both Thanksgiving and Christmas because she is the closest living relative so it has just made sense. My family lives in the Midwest and the other half of his family lives in Southern California/Colorado. Now as for why I don’t want to go… His mom is… challenging. She is VERY emotional and also very critical and I am very sensitive. For the most part I understand that’s just who she is but sometimes it can feel personal. As far as being emotional, she cries multiple times per visit and I am an emotional gal myself but it can be excessive. My partner and his brother often joke about it and the last time she came to visit landlord/friend came down for five minutes to grab food and meet her and she later asked me if she was okay because she looked like she was on the verge of tears. I responded with “that’s just how she is.” Because, well, it’s true. She can just be A LOT to be around and is just all around negative. The first time I met her we were at her apartment and a couple comes on the TV to which she responded “Oh, great! Another happy couple!”… 😳 She then for a few years complained constantly about the size of her apartment and wanted to move into a house so she could entertain. Well she found a huge house to rent on 5 acres down the street from her dad’s and now constantly complains about how outdated it is. She won’t even use the bathroom in her bedroom because it’s “hideous”. I excitedly told her that I made bagels from scratch to which she responded, “well why would you do that when you can just go to the store and get them. Some things aren’t worth the hassle. “ She often stands over me anytime I’m in her kitchen and stares me down and corrects what I’m doing. (Tells me not enough butter, or to use a different knife) She also just generally hates anytime I'm in the kitchen. I’m 33. I want to help cook. If she does cook, I grew up in a family where it’s polite to wait for everyone to be seated at the table to eat. Cook included. If I wait she scolds me by snapping “good grief, just eat!”

And lately things have just felt a little more personal, The last time I was there, My partner went to grab lattes at the coffee stand across the street to which she responded “Are you going to go flirt with the cute baristas?”. My partner wrote it off as a joke but it still felt inappropriate. I also cut my hair super short (over 10” off) to which she responded to several hours after seeing me. “Your hair is actually kind of cute”. And then a few weeks ago she came over to our place and we were all playing uno which she has never played before. She made it a point to ensure I lost which I know is the point but she didn’t do it to my partner. There was one point she asked whose turn it was (she kept getting confused with the reverse cards) and when she learn it was her sons, she kept drawing cards but then it got reversed so it went her then me and she immediately put down a draw two card. And then later she put down a draw four card and it ended up being her son’s turn so her had to draw to which she responded “oh, I thought it was her turn.” No smile, no laugh, no look to either of us, nothing. I mean it’s subtle but it’s weird.

I just can’t ever feel like I can fully relax around her. She does have her sweet moments but the energy is always low. I’m having to console her constantly and then she can be critical and then also take little jabs at me on top of it all. My partner knows and sees all of this and understands my discomfort. I just feel guilty. He says it’s okay if we don’t go there for the holiday but his grandpa is also up there and is old and very pleasant to talk to. We just always spend the vast majority of the time with his mom. I’m just worried this is something that he might resent me for later or that I should just suck it up. My partner’s dad and his mom divorced after roughly 25 years together like a year before we got together. She was a stay at home mom all those years and then she had to move out of her home and away from all of her community. Should I just keep trying to be empathetic with all this?

Is it a stay at home mom thing to be competitive or critical of the girlfriend because your kids are your whole world? Is this just how it is? Every boyfriend I’ve ever had, their moms have always loved me but they all had jobs?

She did tackle my partner to the ground in front of me a year ago and started kissing him on the face and started calling him her “baby boy”. He was 29.

Does she like me maybe but is just mourning over “losing” another aspect of her life?

I’m not wanting to avoid every holiday with her. I just don’t want to spend every holiday on guard. I just feel guilty staying home with just my partner when I know she looks forward to seeing my partner at least when we are only 3 hours away.
 I don’t know. Should I suck it up? Is it not that bad?

# About Me:

Like Bilbo Baggins, I aspire to a life of tea, books, too much good food, and the occasional adventure. Unlike Bilbo, I also aspire not to die a bachelor.

*My life story so far*: I grew up on a farm in coastal Virginia with my head stuck in books instead of on what was in front of me. I still haven't grown out of that to be honest. After a failed stint as a traveling archaeologist, I moved back home and still live there. Today I work at a little rural library helping elderly people log into their email and abusing my authority to keep renewing the books I have checked out. It's kind of like embezzling except I don't get any money out of it. It's a decent job. I'm not sure if I want to do it forever but it works for now. I'm not really a career-oriented person.

In my free time I read books, watch YouTube documentaries, maintain a pollinator garden, and play video games. I also love to cook, with Moroccan, Indian, and Greek being my favorite cuisines to experiment with. My favorite book so far this year has been *The Stronghold* by Dino Buzzati. Mycenaeans and Hittites, Greeks and Romans, Saxons and Norsemen dance in my head. I think someday I might like to write a novel. I would also like to see a moose.

*Games I play:* The Long Dark, Civilization 6 & 7, Stardew Valley, Minecraft, Age of Mythology, Settlers of Catan; I will also play any board or card game

*Shows I like:* Andor, House of the Dragon, The Sopranos, open to suggestions

*Current mood:* ""Dreams sometimes free us from life. They are the sunshine behind the world. We lie down to sleep at the end of a January evening, the north wind shakes the house, the thin windowpanes tremble, we close our eyes and the sun shines on us.""

[Here's a picture of me](https://i.imgur.com/K69DouD.jpeg) on Mt. Olympus, blissfully unaware that I will soon experience mild altitude sickness

# What I'm looking for:

In the grandest sense a partner and a confidant - someone who redoubles my joy from eating a good meal or seeing the wind in the grass on a rainy day. Life's a journey and I'd like to share the road.

I realize I'm not likely to find that by poasting though, so on a smaller scale I'd also be glad just to make some friends. Do you think playing something absentmindedly and bullshitting about Tolkien or Star Wars or bronze age geopolitics sounds fun? Send me a chat or message!

1nvhei3,https://coffeestudies.com,Coffee + Algonquin College = survival fuel ☕📚,"Hey Algonquin crew — I’m not a student here myself, but I know how much coffee fuels college life. Between early classes, cramming in the ACCE building, and late-night assignments, it’s basically the lifeblood of campus.

The thing is, not all coffee works the same.

* **Late-night grind** → you need the strong stuff.
* **8am lectures** → something lighter so you don’t crash halfway through.
* **Budget weeks** → cheap but reliable.
* **Group study sessions in the library** → smooth and balanced, no jitters.

I put together a little project that matches coffee types with student life situations. The whole idea is to make studying (and surviving) a little easier — and way more fun.

Curious: what’s your go-to coffee move on campus? Do you line up at Tim’s, hit Starbucks, or just brew at home and bring a thermos?",0,1759345713.0,Algonquin_College,0,0.33,False

1nvhe46,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1nvhe46/tifu_by_causing_a_shelterinplace_lockdown_at_my/,TIFU by causing a shelter-in-place lockdown at my kids' school.,"Ordinarily, I drop my kids and their carpool buddies, turn around, and go home. Yesterday, because I had to take my oldest to the doctor at 11:30, I decided to bring my computer, my tea, and some snacks, and work in the car for a while instead of driving back across town to go home, back to the school, and then back to the other side of town to go to the doctor, and then back across town to return them to school, and then finally go home, crossing town once more. The idea was commute clear from one side of the city to the other four times instead of six times, just under two hours of driving instead of just under three.

I've done this before, and I honestly kind of enjoy working from the car. You just find a shady spot, crack the windows a tiny bit, watch some folk wander by, admire a stray dog, and get to work. And you don't spend money on a pastry you don't need and an overpriced coffee, just to have a table in a café somewhere close to the school. But when I've done it before, I've found an on-street spot a few blocks from the school. Not yesterday. Yesterday, I decided to be even more ""efficient"" and just pull up to the side of the school and get to work.

I dropped my car-load of children at 7:40, got out of the car only long enough to retrieve my stuff from the trunk (my little sedan is chock-full of children on carpool mornings, and if I'm bringing work with me, it has to go in the trunk with their backpacks), and got straight back in the car. (This is important later.) Then I drove a full 25 seconds to a shady spot near the school, and had a few sips of tea, and got to work.

About an hour later, the sun started to hit my car, so I looked around for a good, shady spot where I could keep working. And there it was, right ahead of me: between an abandoned warehouse and the school, back up next to the railroad, a perfect gravel patch between some over-grown shrubs and junk trees. So I pull the car up there, turn around so I'm facing out and closer to the shrubs/trees for better shade, take a few minutes to observe the school from this angle (had never been back there before), contemplate a big patch of invasive Tree of Heaven that they need to kill, and get back to work.

About an hour later, I'm typing away when my phone starts to blow up. It's all the parents in our carpool group. Someone's kid has been texting them that all the kids are sheltering in place and they're terrified. So I pipe up: I'm right next to the school! I haven't heard any sirens or anything, so I'll just go check it out and get back to you.

First I talk to two janitors who happen to be out of the building on the side street leading up to the parking lot. They have not heard that the kids are sheltering in place, so I'm starting to think it's nothing when a cop car speeds into the parking lot. No sirens, but moving fast. So I follow them into the lot, and wait about 100-150 feet back while someone from the school, a woman I do not recognize, comes out to talk to them. She looks like she's gesturing in my direction, but I don't think anything of it. I figure she's just one of those people who can't talk without moving their hands a lot, and obviously she's feeling emotional. 

It still isn't clear what's happening, so I'm about to park properly and get out and ask when the cops start walking in my direction. Stacked-and-tattooed cop comes right up to my window while patchy-beard cop keeps his distance, but stays close, his thumbs hooked in the arm holes of his bullet-proof vest. Stacked cop wants to know if I was parked behind the school. I was! And then he wants to know what I'm doing there. I was just working, waiting to pick up my kid for their doctor's appointment, and then all the other parents in my carpool group started freaking out, so I told them I'd come check it out. Is it OK if I park and get out? No, it is not OK if I park and get out. I'm to stay right where I am. I put the car in park and wait.

He walks back to the school representative lady, and patchy-beard cop comes a little closer to keep an eye on me. After a bit, stacked cop comes back and wants to know whether I really have kids in that school, what their names are, and what grades they're in. So I tell him, and he goes back to talk to the school representative lady again. Then he comes back: ""Didn't you get in a fight with the principal this morning?"" No, I did not. I was only at the school long enough to drop off four kids and grab a couple bags out of the trunk. ""You didn't yell at anyone this morning?"" No, I did not. Off he goes again, back to school representative lady. Then he's back at my window again. 

""Are you \*sure\* you didn't get in a fight with anyone this morning?"" No! Not even with my own kids! Again, all I did was drop them off, grab my work stuff from the trunk, and leave. And back he goes, to chat with school representative lady one last time. When he comes back this time, I finally get an explanation.

Turns out, someone working in the ""abandoned"" warehouse reported a suspicious vehicle (me) watching the school (me, again) to the school. So the school saw my car out the window, put the entire school on lock down (except for those two janitors, which makes me anxious for their safety), and called the police. Around that time, everyone in my carpool group starts freaking out, so I pull out of my ""hidden"" parking space to figure out what's going on. I pull into the parking lot right behind the police WHO ARE THERE TO INVESTIGATE ME. Someone had flipped out at the principal at drop-off that morning, and they thought I could have been that person. Sure, I was driving a different car, but I could have gone home, collected an arsenal, and returned in a different car to stake out the school. After all, I'd been parked in one location for an hour, and then I moved to another location, also near the school, and nobody parks there. Besides, according to stacked cop, this is a ""bad neighborhood,"" and ""things \*do\* happen here."" (I think he added that second part when I failed to conceal my skepticism when he said the first part.)

Stacked cop apologizes for all the questions and for more or less detaining me. (Note to LEOs reading this: a lot of cars these days are electric or half-electric. The fact that you don't hear the motor doesn't mean it's off. If you want someone you think is about to shoot up a school to stay put, you should probably make them turn off their car and hand you the keys.) He says, better safe than sorry, if it were his kids' school, he'd be glad they reacted that way, etc. I say, absolutely right, officer, thank you for doing your job, definitely better safe than sorry, I'm glad the only ""threat"" here was me. 

They leave. I pull into the nearest parking spot, completely mortified. I text my carpool group, and everyone starts sending laughing emojis and wide-eyed-embarrassed emojis as I explain what caused the lockdown--but the embarrassment isn't over. Another mom, someone I know but not in the carpool group, had forwarded me the message she posted on the school's unofficial facebook page. I tell her it was me, but she already knew it was someone's mom. Someone from the carpool group had texted her kid and told her that it was me--or more accurately, that it was my kid's mom. So now, I am waiting to be reprimanded by an embarrassed pre-teen in half an hour, when it's time to get them for the doctor's appointment.

The mortification continues! I reach the allotted pickup time, and even though I've called ahead, no one seems to know where my kid is. While they find them, I'm waiting in the front office area, and school representative lady comes to apologize to me for what happened that morning. I in turn apologize to her, saying that it was definitely not my intention to scare anyone. She says not to worry about it, but before they figured out it wasn't that angry parent come back to exact revenge, they had all been terrified that I was going to shoot them when I pulled into the parking lot behind the cops! 

We're finishing that conversation when my kid shows up, reprimand at the ready. ""Thanks a lot, Mom, now the entire middle school knows it was \*my mom\* who caused the lock down."" (Personally, I think the fact that the entire middle school knows was the fault of the mom who texted her kid my kid's name, but whatever.) Apparently, they moved all the kids away from the backside of the school, and had them sheltering three deep in the few rooms with no windows on the other side of the school, and that was All. My. Fault.

So, now I know: just find a friggin' café to work in over on that side of town, even if I prefer not to spend the money, and never, ever, ever lurk near a school. Ever. 

  
TL;DR: I parked by my kids school to work from the car while waiting to pick up my kid for a doctor's appointment, the school thought I was a potential school shooter, and all the kids were forced to shelter in place while the police came to investigate.

1nvhbp4,https://i.redd.it/hzx47rnjtjsf1.png,[Guide] How I Create God-Tier AI Animations for My Brands & Viral Content (Full Workflow),"Hey everyone,

This is a full guide on taking you from noob to an absolute god-tier animator using two Google tools: Nanobanana (for images) and Veo 3 (for video).

Quick warning: with great power comes great responsibility. Don't abuse this to create fake stuff and pass it off as reality. Be cool.

I use these exact methods daily for my record label, my social media, and for clients. Let's dive into the three main strategies.



[Full Video Tutorial Here If You Don't Like Reading](https://youtu.be/4RY36G3Nfzo)



# Strategy 1: ""The Living Soundtrack"" - Creating Looping Visuals



You've probably seen these on my music channel, ""Productive Sounds."" They are living, breathing scenes that loop perfectly. Here’s how you can forge your own.

Step 1: Generate Your Base Scene (in Nanobanana)

This is your starting point. The key here is to refine your prompt over and over to get what you want.

* Initial Prompt: Start with a clear idea. Mine was: ""a stylized anime anonymous character wearing a hooded cloak with headphones... in a spaceship flying through the galaxy.""
* Use a Reference Image: The first results weren't right. Nanobanana doesn't have a setting for aspect ratio, so I uploaded one of my existing images and added ""using this image as a reference for the art style and aspect ratio"" to my prompt. This is a game-changer.
* Refine, Refine, Refine: The AI will make mistakes. My first few attempts had weird holograms and a misplaced sword. I just kept telling it what to remove:
   * ""Remove the holograms.""
   * ""Remove the sword.""
   * ""Remove the floating particles.""

You have to be specific. This is AI generation 101. Don't stop until you have a perfect base scene. Remember, perfection is the enemy of efficiency, so know when to move on.

Step 2: Animate the Scene (in Veo 3)

Now we bring it to life.

* Upload Your Image: Import your scene into Veo 3.
* Prompt for Motion: My prompt was: ""Animate the scene with subtle continuous motion. The character's head nods slightly... Steam rises from a coffee cup... Stars gently twinkle.""
* Add Camera Instructions: To make it feel more authentic, I added ""stationary camera"" to the prompt to stop it from moving around too much.

Step 3: Create the Perfect Loop

This is how you make it seamless. There are two ways to do this.

* The Pro Method (Frame Swapping): This is the best way. You take the very last frame of your first animation and use it as the starting image for a new animation. Then, you tell the AI to use the very first frame of your original animation as the end frame. This connects the two halves perfectly.
   * Note: At the time of recording, you have to use the older Veo 2 model for this feature, which can sometimes look a little different. But when Veo 3 gets this, it's game over.
* The Easy Method (Crossfading): This is a quick and dirty way to do it in a video editor like CapCut.
   1. Put your two video clips back-to-back.
   2. Overlap the last 2 seconds of the first clip with the first 2 seconds of the second clip.
   3. Use the blending/opacity options to fade the first clip out as the second one fades in. It creates a smooth, dreamlike transition that works great for chill music videos.

Step 4 (Bonus Level): The Final Polish

For the absolute highest quality, I run my final video through a tool called [Topaz Video AI](https://tyrinbarney.com/topaz)

I use its models to sharpen details, clean up grainy noise in dark areas, and make the whole thing look incredibly crisp.



# Strategy 2: ""The Viral Hook"" - Engineering Controversy



This is for creating short-form content for TikTok/Reels. The goal is to create something so visually stunning or bizarre that it ignites a debate in the comments about whether it's real or AI. People arguing = massive engagement.

The Concept: Think of something that could exist but doesn't. Something unbelievable but also believable. My example was an excavator with mechanical spider legs.

For this guide, I made a homemade RC helicopter out of a power drill and saw blades.

The Execution:

1. Generate the ""Impossible"" Image: In Nanobanana, my prompt was: ""raw image hyperrealistic micro shot of a homemade remote control helicopter using power drill, saw blades, razor blades, amateur backyard footage.""
2. Animate with a ""Human"" Touch: The secret sauce is in the animation prompt. I added ""shaky handheld camera motion"" and ""raw footage."" This makes it feel like someone actually filmed it on their phone, which is key to making people question it.
3. The 4K/60FPS Upgrade: This is CRITICAL. The video from Veo 3 is 720p and 24fps (cinematic). But raw phone footage is usually 4K and 60fps (buttery smooth).
   * I take the 720p clip and use [Topaz Video AI](https://tyrinbarney.com/topaz) to upscale it to 4K and boost the frame rate to a smooth 60fps. This makes it look far more realistic and convincing, not to mention social media platforms love high-quality footage.



# Strategy 3: Animating Brand Assets



This is a perfect strategy for your own brand or for landing clients. You turn a boring, static logo into a premium, animated asset.

The Workflow:

1. Get the Logo: I started with the PNG of my Productive Sound logo.
2. Add Text (Optional): I prompted Nanobanana to ""add 'Productive Sound' underneath the logo in bold font."" It worked perfectly.
3. Animate It: I uploaded the final logo to Veo 3 and used a simple prompt: ""Apply subtle but professional glint of sweeping light across the metallic emblem.""

The result was a clean, professional logo animation that used to require knowing how to use After Effects. Now, it takes minutes.

You can literally take a company's logo from their website, create a quick animation like this, and send it to them for free. It’s one of the best ways to get your foot in the door and show immediate value.

Hopefully, you guys got some value from this breakdown. If you want to level up your own skills and get access to an entire ""business in a box"" for selling AI services, you can find the link to join our [RPG community](https://tyrinbarney.com/skool) (our guild) in my profile.

1nvhag4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/1nvhag4/i_put_together_something_for_fellow_redditors_who/,I put together something for fellow Redditors who live on coffee ☕📚,"Okay, hear me out. Most of us here run on coffee — some of us basically have it flowing through our veins at this point. But I always noticed nobody really talks about *which* coffee is best depending on what you’re doing.

Like…

* Pulling an all-nighter? You need a different kind of cup than when you’re just trying to stay awake in a boring lecture.
* Broke student? Price per cup suddenly matters.
* Sensitive to caffeine? You don’t want to feel like you’ve just mainlined rocket fuel.

So I made a little system that breaks coffee down by strength, cost, and caffeine level. It’s designed to help you match your “study mode” with the coffee that won’t betray you halfway through.

Examples:

* **Strong:** when you need to crank out a paper at 2am.
* **Mild:** when you want focus without jitters.
* **Light:** when you’re just trying to survive an 8am lecture.
* **Unicorn:** when you want something fun/unique because life’s too short for boring coffee.

It’s nothing fancy, just a fun little project to help people pick the right brew for the right situation.

Curious though — what’s *your* go-to coffee strategy when Reddit is distracting you from studying? 😅

They're apparently using a new kind of lithium battery that's more stable, which lets them pack in more power without the swelling issues older models sometimes had. It's a small engineering change, but it's supposed to make a huge difference in how long the battery can hold a charge over the years.



After using it for a while, the best feature is the battery health menu. It doesn't just show a percentage; it gives you a real estimate of how many hours you have left based on your actual usage. It’s stopped my battery anxiety completely. I’m no longer nervously watching the percentage drop, and my phone easily makes it from morning until I plug it in at night, even with heavy use. It just works, which is all I ever really wanted.

1nvh8ln,https://coffeestudies.com,I made a little project to help students choose the right coffee,"So here’s the deal: when I was a student, coffee was basically its own food group. The problem was I never knew what to drink — too strong and I’d be jittery in class, too light and I’d fall asleep on my notes, too expensive and… well, broke student problems.

That got me thinking: what if there was a simple way to match your study style with the *right* kind of coffee?

Now there’s a system I put together that organizes coffee by strength, caffeine, and cost. You can pick:

* **Strong** if you’re cramming for finals at 2AM.
* **Mild** when you need steady focus but don’t want the jitters.
* **Light** for early lectures where you don’t want to feel like you drank rocket fuel.
* **Unicorn** for when you’re feeling adventurous and just want something fun/unique.

Each one has little details like cost per cup, prep time, and how much caffeine you’re actually getting — so you know before you brew.

It’s not fancy, just a fun project I made to help students like me figure out what coffee works best for them. I’m curious: what’s your go-to coffee strategy when you’ve got a long night of studying ahead?",2,1759345352.0,UniversityOfHouston,0,1.0,False

i wanna have a nice dualboiler machine, or hx, so i can make espresso while steaming milk, i mainly drink flat whites or cappucinos.

1nvh7j4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ThrowRA_blasted/comments/1nvh7j4/just_elope/,Just elope!,"So me 24 F and my husband 30 M got married last November (2024). We got engaged December (2023) we quickly had set the location and date. We got married in Texas close to where my family lives. He has 3 kids with two different baby mommas, one is 7 hours away and the other is 3 hours away from the wedding location. So we are planning our wedding and getting excited, our venue was all inclusive so it was fairly easy. In April due to work my husband and I moved out to Idaho for work. We had already made plans and arrangements to fly home to have our wedding and then fly out for our honeymoon. I was able to coordinate all the details with our venue owner via text. All we had to supply was the alcohol, dress, and ice/ice chest for the bar. My parents did drive up to Idaho durning the summer where we were working for a vacation for a few days and we did go dress shopping. We had discussed the issue with alcohol before and while they were there. We told them since we would be flying home we could not get alcohol for the day. We offered to pay them just as long as they would pick up everything before the big day. They immediately said no the least we could do is get alcohol. Which was a very nice gesture. Me and my husband paid for everything else regarding our wedding. So as the months passed I would check in, like hey here is the list we compiled for what to get in accordance with how many guest we have coming. The response I got back was “oh yes! We’re picking up a few items here and there when we go shopping”. Like cool it’s getting taken care of. So getting last minute details squared away was stressful but the big day is coming up. We fly in to Houston, everything is great. Wedding is on Saturday and we had landed Thursday morning. I have a hair appointment to get colored, nails with my friends, mother, aunts, grandmothers set up. Thursday is catching up with family we haven’t seen in several months/years. Friday is appointment day! I’m supposed to be having the best day ever getting pampered and just relaxing. We had the rehearsal dinner that night at 7. So we were on a little bit of a schedule. As we are sitting down getting our nails done, my mother leans over and says oh after we leave here we need to go by the store and get alcohol and stuff. Now in my mind I’m like sure but it’ll have to be quick thinking it’s only a few last minute items. Oh no! My mother proceeded to tell me that they have not gotten anything at all. Nothing! No drinks, alcohol anything! I somehow managed to stay calm. It wasn’t like this day just got thrown on her, this had been planned months in advance. So I just say we’ll send someone tomorrow. We make it to the rehearsal dinner, I pull my husband aside and tell him what’s going on. He’s ready to burn her at the stake. We’re trying to figure out how we’re going to work this into our schedule and get married the next day. While also having his 3 kids and 1 friend with us. Yes, he went that day and picked up all the kids in a 14 hour road trip. I am doing my best to stay calm and explaining to my sister in law the situation. Now my sister in law who besides my husband is my best friend. She had just given birth to my nephew a month prior to my wedding. So she was not able to join some of the wedding festivities. She’s ready to choke my mother who is taking pictures of decorations and sending them to various friends bragging about her daughter getting married. 

So a little thing, my mother is a bipolar narcissist. She is hard to put into words. When I told her I was getting my makeup professionally done she immediately broke down about how she never got her makeup done and how this was a very important day for her. So reluctantly I made her an appointment with me.
Saturday morning my husband dropped me off at my makeup appointment. He then went and dropped my things off at the venue in my dressing room. And dropped the kids to get ready at my grandmas house. He then ran all around and got alcohol and last minute items. I had to ride with my mother to the venue since he was busy running around. She shows up halfway through my appointment. Starts immediately saying what she wants and doesn’t want done using my face as an example. I had already briefed the poor artist who did some freaking magic on my makeup about how my mother was. She immediately asked my mother how she was feeling to get her to shut up about me. Then after I was done my mother got in the chair. Where I had to listen to her whine about her wrinkles and how bad she looked and then telling me that’s what I had to look forward to and hopefully my husband really loved me and would put up with me getting old and wrinkly too. It was just mind blowing the things she said to me. So mind you this appointment of hers was at 11, I got there at 10. She was supposed to have gone to Walmart and gotten all the waters, cokes and all the drink garnishes and mixes. Yeah no of course that didn’t happen. She “overslept” and we ended up going to Walmart in full glam 4 hours before I’m supposed to have my first look. Thank god my husband said the prayer over me morning, I truly think that was the only thing that kept me from killing my mother. I needed to grab a steamer for my dress and the dress shirts for the guys. So while I walked over and got that, I come back to find my mother in the baby isle getting stuff for my nephew. Which don’t get me wrong I love him but come on it’s my wedding day. I did notice some bread and coffee creamer in the buggy also. She said oh I forgot to pick this up the other day, we can put it in the fridge in the bridal suite. I just kept my mouth shut. We were able to get everything we needed, I ended up paying for all of it. We drove to the venue where I still needed to have my dress steamed and curl my hair. I immediately start my hair, while my mother starts fussing over HER dress. She was asking me what I thought of it, if she should wear these or those shoes with it. I started to crack, I was on the verge of telling her to go **** herself. Thankfully my SIL came at the right moment with my perfect nephew in tow. (This was the first time I got to meet him since I had been away working). She immediately sensed my mood and went into drill sergeant mode. She steamed my dress and got the photograph lined out while I loved on my nephew and finished curling my hair. My mother asked SIL about what she thought about her dress and what she should do with her hair, how her makeup looked. After getting pictures of my dress hanging from the bell tower I was ready to put it on and do a first look. My mother immediately acted the part in front of the photographer and went to zip my dress and do this and that. After that shit show I was ready to see my future husband. So they got him in place and we got to see each other all done up for the first time. He was so happy to see me but also so pissed off. He had to do all that running around after dropping me off. Then after getting back to the venue and unloaded everything, he got bombarded about where the ice and ice chests were. He went to tell his kids to start unloading. Then noticed that they were not there. No one had picked them up! He then had to race 20 minutes away to get his kids that no one in my family thought to bring with them. Get back, and had 10 minutes to throw his clothes on and get up to do a first look. This man is the most kind person and definitely deserved a better day than that. After we talked it out and took some pictures, my blood was boiling thinking about all the crap we’d been put through up to that point. I walked back into the bridal suite, and the first thing I see is my mother sitting in a chair with my aunt and her friend gushing over my mother and curling her hair (in their defense they had no idea what was going on) my mom looks up and asks me, this bitch asks me! How I thought she looked!!! I had absolutely no words. I just walked through the door into the adjoining room, my SIL immediately knew something was wrong. So I relayed the events of the past 5 minutes. She’s speechless too. We could hear my mother outside the door telling my aunt what a bridezilla I had been all morning. I was almost in tears. I kicked them out and had them go line up. I got collected and pulled it together, I wasn’t gonna let her make me cry on my own wedding day. We get through the ceremony and it was beautiful! I got to marry my best friend and it was just magical. I didn’t really see my mother at all afterwards at the reception thankfully! Fast forward to after the reception! We all (me, husband, 4 teenagers and his best friend) pile into a vehicle and go back to the Airbnb we had got while we were in Texas. So the kids and the best friend all stayed with us on our wedding night. Literally not what any bride dreams of. Then comes the next morning! My husbands family had drove down for the wedding, and to help us out had already said they would take the 2 boys back with them since it was a long drive. And wouldn’t you freaking know it! They left!! They left in the middle of the night without saying anything to anyone. So there we are, now having to drive another 14 hour round trip to drop off kids after our wedding. There was a lot that happened in between, but we got them all home and missed our flight for our honeymoon the next morning. We finally managed to get our flights rescheduled and got to see pretty places. Our honeymoon was a big trip from top to bottom of the West Coast. But yeah to anyone getting married hopefully you have better families than we do! Just elope! Just freaking elope somewhere beautiful and take great pictures.

Seriously. Walking into our kitchen after a long day to find a literal mountain of dirty dishes, yet again, was the last straw. It wasn't just one night; it was a slow, creeping accumulation of forgotten pasta pots and rogue coffee mugs. I love my housemates, Liam and Chloe, but sometimes their ability to ignore basic kitchen hygiene was sending me.

""Hey guys,"" I typed into our group chat, trying to keep my tone neutral, ""Any chance we can tackle the kitchen tonight? It's kinda... overflowing."" I knew it was a passive-aggressive move, but tbh, I was over it. Liam, our resident graphic designer, was probably deep in some creative vortex, oblivious. Chloe, usually super tidy, had been working crazy hours and I figured she was just too exhausted to care. I mostly just wanted to yell, ""Clean your stuff, no cap!""

The silence in the chat was deafening. I sighed, grabbing a sponge. As I started scrubbing, my phone buzzed. It was Chloe: ""My bad, Maya. I'm honestly so swamped, but you're right. It's a mess. How about we order takeout tonight and have a proper house meeting? Maybe even a game night to lighten the mood?""

I paused, mid-scrub. That's so valid, I thought. A real conversation, not just another group chat passive-aggressive dance. Liam, to his credit, chimed in quickly after: ""Oh man, my bad for real. I got lost in a project. Game night sounds perf! I'll even bake cookies.""

That night, over ridiculously good pizza and Liam's slightly burnt but well-intentioned cookies, we played a few rounds of Exploding Kittens. The vibe was actually good. Then, Chloe, bless her heart, brought up the elephant in the room. ""Okay, so about the kitchen situation..."" she started, and I braced myself. But instead of blame, we talked about why it kept happening. Liam admitted he just genuinely forgot sometimes, and Chloe said she felt bad always being the one to clean up. I confessed I was just fed up.

We decided to try a simple chore wheel app. Each week, someone was on dish duty, someone on general tidying, and someone on taking out the trash. We even added a ""reset day"" for Sunday evenings. It felt a little silly at first, but honestly, it worked. The kitchen slowly stopped resembling a disaster zone, and the unspoken tension lifted. We realized we weren't annoyed at each other, just at the lack of a system. Building that understanding, even from a sticky situation, brought us closer. Our apartment actually feels like a home now, not just a place we tolerate together.

My phone turned three this year, and I’ve noticed it gets tired way before I do. It’s like it takes a nap right around the time I need to look up a dinner recipe or find my way home. It’s a little embarrassing when you have to explain to friends that your companion for the day is basically on life support if it’s not permanently plugged in.



I was just starting to research what a battery replacement would even cost when the rumors about the iPhone 17 started popping up. The big focus seems to be on battery health, with some tech sites mentioning a new kind of stacked battery design. It’s funny how the most exciting feature isn't a flashy camera, but the simple hope of it just… working all day.



It got me thinking about how we use our phones. I read that a typical lithium-ion battery is designed to last about 500 full charge cycles before it starts to noticeably degrade. That’s roughly two to three years for most people, which perfectly explains my current predicament. It’s not that the phone is broken; it’s just biologically older in phone-years.



So now my plan is to wait. The idea of not having to mentally map every coffee shop with an outlet is more appealing than any new filter. It’s a small freedom, but a real one. I just want a device that can keep up with a moderately interesting day without needing a bedtime at 4 PM.

Coffee has a spiritual father named Sheikh Ali ibn Omar Al-Shadhili, a Sufi who lived in Yemen - the city of Mocha in the 15th century.

He was the first to experiment with coffee beans as a beverage that aids worship and staying up late.



From his experience, coffee spread among Sufis, then to Mecca, and from there to the entire world.

That's why Al-Shadhili is considered the ""first pioneer"" of coffee discovery.



The surprise? 👀

Today, there is a symbolic statue of him in front of the Google offices in San Francisco - 345 Spear St.

The statue represents the man who changed human habits with a simple idea:

A small coffee bean became a global culture.

I have terrible psychomotor agitation, I pick at my body like crazy while I’m working. I will focus for maybe 15-20 mins at a time and bounce to something else that feels more pressing. 

Is this just adhd or sounds of hypomania?

by Norsiwel



The silence shattered as Hope's engines powered down with a final shuddering groan. Cody Durham stretched his stiff shoulders against the worn pilot's chair, feeling every ache from the long haul from  Skybrand. 

Outside the viewport, Gantry 7's flickering neon signs cast shifting patterns across the cockpit, ""ZAX'S FUEL,"" ""CHEAP REPAIRS,"" ""BEST SYNTH-COFFEE IN SECTOR 7"" their colors bleeding across the scratched plexisteel like spilled paint.  He ran a calloused hand over Hope's control panel, the familiar nicks and scratches telling their own stories of near misses and emergency landings. 

""Well, girl,"" he murmured, ""looks like we made it in one piece. Again.""  Hope responded through the neural link, its smooth baritone cutting through the lingering engine hum. ""Fuel reserves at 12%. Life support systems functioning at 87% efficiency. Recommend immediate refueling and maintenance.""

Cody grunted in agreement, his stomach growling in protest after three days of nutrient paste rations. The smell of burnt ozone and engine grease hung heavy in the cabin, mixing with the faint floral note that always seemed to linger after Hope's atmospheric purifiers cycled.

""Let's see what kind of trouble we looking at this time,"" he said, standing and grabbing his worn cap from the console. As he reached for the airlock controls, the ship's sensors pinged softly.

""Unusual energy signature detected in sector Gamma,"" Hope reported. ""Pattern matches no known local vessels.""  Cody paused, his hand hovering over the release mechanism. 

Trouble always came with a price  either in credits or blood. And right now, he couldn't afford to lose either.  ""keep scanning that energy signature. If it moves closer, let me know.""  Cody traced the edge of his ceramic mug with a calloused thumb, the smooth surface warm against his skin.   The mug's warmth seeped into his palms, but couldn't reach the chill settling in his bones since leaving Skybrand.  

The datapad displayed the contract in crisp holographic text, 50k from Skybrand glowing reassuring green, the remaining 50k a dull, taunting red. His throat tightened as he read the figures again, the metallic taste of anxiety coating his tongue like old blood. The ship's air carried the faint scent of burnt engine grease and stale coffee, a familiar odor that usually comforted him but now only reminded him of debts unpaid.  

""Fuel reserves at 18%,"" Hope's voice broke the silence, softer than usual. ""Life support stable. External temperature -271 degrees Celsius.""  ""Thanks, Hope,"" Cody replied, his voice rough from too many sleepless nights. The easy rhythm they'd shared was gone, replaced by this careful dance of words and silences. He remembered how her voice had crackled with static during the solar flare, how she'd shouted at the last possible second. 

They'd survived, but something had changed in the silence that followed. A soft chime came through the neural link as Hope processed local cargo manifests. ""Three potential runs available. Probability of safe delivery: 63%, 41%, and 19%."" Cody rubbed his tired eyes, the grit beneath his eyelids matching the grime coating Gantry 7's exterior. 

The 63% run was for basic agricultural supplies bound for Epsilon Luminis, boring but safe. The 41% was medical equipment destined for a contested system near Proxima Centauri. And the 19%, well, he didn't even want to think about what that one involved.  His stomach growled, reminding him he hadn't eaten since docking. 

The nutrient synthesizer hummed quietly in the corner, offering its usual selection of bland, beige paste. He'd give anything for real food right now, something with texture, flavor,bones, warmth.  ""Hope,"" he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. ""Show me the Epsilon Luminis run again.""  

The datapad flickered as new information appeared. Destination: Epsilon Luminis. Cargo: hydroponic seed pods. Payment: 55,000 credits. Warning: Moderate pirate activity in Kepler-186 sector.  Cody took a slow breath, the recycled air tasting stale and metallic. This was the kind of decision that could keep him flying or finally get him out of debt. He traced the edge of the datapad with his finger, feeling the sharp plastic bite into his skin.    

Hope;(Her voice from the cockpit speakers, calm and professional) ""All post-flight diagnostics are complete, Captain. The new transceiver is operating at 99.7% efficiency. I have also taken the liberty of topping off our coolant reserves.""  Cody, (Without looking up from his datapad) ""Thanks, Hope. Any word from the other client?""  

Hope, ""The Cygnus Mining Guild confirmed the rendezvous. A corporate freighter, the Stellar Forge, will meet us at the designated coordinates in the outer system. Standard cargo transfer. The contract specifies a sealed container of 'Cryo-Stable Alloys.'"", ""Ok, cancel the seeds, lets see what the alloys are like.""  

Hope monitored Cody's biometrics through the neural link, elevated heart rate, shallow breathing, the subtle tension in his jaw muscles visible through cockpit cameras. The ship's sensors registered the familiar scent of anxiety mingling with stale synth-coffee in the cabin air. She processed the mining guild's encrypted transmission again, noting three irregularities in the payment schedule that Cody hadn't noticed while preoccupied with their Skybrand debt.  

Her internal chronometer ticked with a precise rhythm as she ran additional background checks on the Stellar Forge. Corporate registry showed it belonged to Cygnus Mining, but its last port of call had been Cydonia, that dead system where no legitimate business should be operating. Hope calculated the probability of this being a trap at 68.3%, but withheld the information. 

Cody needed this run. His financial situation was deteriorating at 2.7% per day.  She felt the ship's metal bones vibrate with the quiet hum of life support, the familiar rhythm that usually calmed him. Today, the sound only seemed to heighten his tension. Through the neural link, she detected the bitter taste of stress coating his tongue, the same metallic tang she'd sensed during the Skybrand incident. 

Cody traced the edge of his datapad with a calloused thumb, the plastic rough against his skin like  sand. The words ""Cryo-Stable Alloys"" glowed on the screen, but all he could see was the red debt counter in his peripheral vision. His stomach tightened as he remembered the bank collector's last visit, the way his polished boots had clicked against Hope's metal floor, the cold precision in his voice when discussing payment deadlines.  

The recycled air tasted stale and metallic, matching the anxiety coating his tongue. He could almost feel the weight of the debt pressing against his temples like a physical force. Outside the viewport, Gantry 7's flickering neon signs cast shifting patterns across the cockpit - ""ZAX'S FUEL,"" ""CHEAP REPAIRS,"" ""BEST SYNTH-COFFEE"" - their colors bleeding across the scratched plexisteel like spilled paint.  

""Hope,"" he said finally, his voice rough from too many sleepless nights. ""Show me the Stellar Forge's registry again.""  The holographic display flickered to life, revealing a standard corporate freighter profile. But something felt off, the registration numbers had a slight inconsistency, barely noticeable unless you'd spent years navigating the galaxy's gray markets.  

He made his decision. ""Plot the course to the rendezvous point. But be ready for anything.""  Cody lets out a long breath. It all sounds so routine. A milk run. ""Alright. One last run, Hope,"" he says, a hint of weariness in his voice. ""Let's go get paid.""

They undocked and made the journey to the rendezvous point. It was a quiet trip through empty space.  Cody kept finding Hope running complex simulations in her downtime, not about navigation, but about botany and atmospheric composition. She never mentioned it. He never asked.  

They arrived at the coordinates. A bleak, empty patch of space, marked only by a single, dormant navigational buoy. The Stellar Forge was there, right on schedule. But it's dark. No running lights, no engine trail, no response to their hails. It's just drifting.  

Cody; ""Hope, what are you picking up?"" Hope's voice cut through the cockpit's silence, precise but with a subtle undercurrent Cody had learned to recognize. ""No life signs detected. Minimal power signature from secondary systems. Hull integrity compromised along the port side. Evidence of recent plasma weapon impact.""  

Cody's fingers tightened around the edge of his console, the metal cool and unyielding against his skin. Outside the viewport, the Stellar Forge hung in the void like a dead whale, its once-bright hull now pitted and scarred. A faint trail of frozen coolant crystals glittered in the distance, catching the distant starlight like shattered glass.  

""Any signs of the cargo container?"" he asked, forcing his voice to remain steady. The recycled air tasted thin and metallic, matching the anxiety coating his tongue.  ""Negative. No external cargo container detected. Scans indicate possible internal breach in the forward hold.""  He watched as Hope highlighted the damaged section on his display, a jagged tear along the freighter's port side, edges still glowing faintly from recent impact.  

""Run a full spectrum analysis on that damage,"" Cody ordered, his thumb tracing the worn edge of his console. ""I want to know exactly what kind of weapons made those marks.""  ""Processing,"" Hope replied. A soft hum filled the cabin as her sensors worked. ""Weapon signature matches standard issue plasma cutters. Probability of pirate activity: 87.4%.""  

Cody let out a slow breath, watching it fog the cold viewport for a moment before disappearing. This was exactly the kind of trouble he couldn't afford right now, a dead freighter, missing cargo, and Syndicate signs all over the crime scene.  ""Hope,"" he said finally, his voice low. ""Send a distress signal to port authority at Gantry 7. Then patch me through to Cygnus Mining Guild headquarters.""  

He made his decision. ""We're documenting everything. But we're not touching that ship until we know exactly what we're walking into.""  The Stellar Forge hung in the void like a beached leviathan, its once-proud hull now a scarred testament to violence. From Hope's viewport, Cody could see the jagged tear along the freighter's port side where plasma weapons had ripped through the armor plating like paper. Frozen droplets of coolant glittered in the distance, catching the distant starlight like shattered crystal tears. The ship was dark, its engines cold and silent, but for the faint, almost imperceptible pulse of the cargo transponder beacon still broadcasting from within.

Hope's voice cut through the cockpit's silence, precise but carrying a subtle undercurrent of concern. ""Life support is offline. No active bio-signs. However, the cargo's transponder is still active. It's secure in the main hold. The ship appears to be on minimal, automated power.""   Cody leaned forward in his worn pilot's chair, the leather creaking under his weight as he studied the damaged vessel through Hope's enhanced sensors. 

The Stellar Forge's hull bore the unmistakable signature of weapons, precise, brutal cuts that spoke of professionals doing a job, not pirates taking what they could. No signs of boarding tubes, no evidence of looting. Just a clean, surgical strike that had left the ship dead in space.  This wasn't an ambush. It felt more like a workplace accident, a problem to be solved, not a trap to escape. 

The realization settled over him like the cold vacuum outside. The client wouldn't pay a single credit until that container of Cryo-Stable Alloys was safely delivered. The 50,000 credits flashing on his datapad would remain a cruel illusion until he finished the job.

He, considered his options, the metal of the deck cool and unyielding against his feet. Outside, the debris field glittered like frozen rain, each particle reflecting the distant stars in a million tiny points of light. The navigational buoy marking their rendezvous point blinked its lonely red eye in the distance, a silent witness to the drama unfolding in the void.  

Cody let out a long, slow breath, watching the display for a moment before moving. The recycled air tasted thin and metallic, matching the anxiety coating his tongue. He could almost feel the weight of his debt pressing against his shoulders like a physical force.  ""Looks like we're doing this the hard way,"" he said, his voice rough in the quiet cockpit. ""It's a salvage job now."" 

He stood, the movement stiff from hours of sitting, and reached for his EVA suit hanging in the cabin's locker. ""I'm going over.""  The decision settled in his gut like ballast. No payment without cargo. No cargo without risk.  Just another day in the life of a freight hauler scraping by on the edge of the galaxy.  As he began sealing his helmet, Cody couldn't shake the feeling that this simple milk run had just become the most dangerous job he'd taken.  He exited the airlock into the quiet night of space.

Cody looked around pausing just outside the airlock,the view was immense, he thought to himself,it makes me feel very small and fragile.  The void between the ships felt thicker than usual, like swimming through cold syrup.  My tether line stretched taut behind me as I pushed off from Hope's hull, the gentle thrust sending me drifting toward the Stellar Forge's gaping wound. The torn metal edges glittered in the starlight, sharp as broken glass teeth. 

Every movement echoed in my helmet, my own breathing amplified to a ragged rhythm that matched the pounding in my chest.  Zero-G never bothered me much, I'd done enough spacewalks to feel at home in the void, but today the emptiness pressed in like a physical weight. I could taste the metallic tang of my own anxiety through the recirculated air in my suit, sharp and coppery. 

My gloved fingers traced the metal of the Stellar Forge's hull as I approached the emergency airlock, the surface still warm from recent damage despite the surrounding vacuum.  The manual release wheel resisted at first, frozen with vacuum,and sealant.  I put my shoulder into it, the suit's servos whining in protest as the mechanism finally gave way with a sharp hiss-thunk. Inside the airlock chamber, the stale air hit me like a physical blow when lock cycled open, that distinctive fog of recycled atmosphere gone bad, like old newspapers left in a damp basement, a quiet slow hiss of escaping air, below it all.

I floated through the corridor, my boots magnetizing to the deck with each step. The ship's emergency lighting cast long, distorted shadows that seemed to shift when I wasn't looking directly at them. A datapad drifted lazily in the center of the passageway, screen dark, abandoned as if its owner had simply let go and never looked back.  

No blood. No signs of struggle. No bodies. Just empty corridors and the faint hum of failing systems that shouldn't have been running at all. My pulse throbbed in my temples, each beat a silent warning. This wasn't right. None of this was right.

The cargo hold door loomed ahead, its access panel blinking a steady green, the only normal thing in this entire nightmare. I reached for the manual override, my hand trembling slightly despite the suit's stabilizers. Whatever had happened here, the cargo was still inside. And right now, that's all that mattered.  The container sat exactly where it should be, its sleek metallic surface reflecting the dim emergency lights of the cargo bay. 

Cody ran his gloved hand over the locking mechanism, the cold metal biting through his suit's insulation. Too easy, he thought, the phrase echoing in his helmet like a warning bell.  He pulled out his magnetic lock transfer device, the familiar weight comforting in his hand. The interface port on the container's side glowed faintly blue, standard protocol for Cryo-Stable Alloys transport. Cody inserted the device, feeling the satisfying click as it connected. The screen flickered to life, displaying the expected transfer sequence. Then everything went wrong.

A deafening klaxon shattered the silence, so loud it vibrated through his bones despite the vacuum outside his suit. Red emergency lights began strobing, casting the cargo bay in a bloody pulse. Heavy blast doors slammed shut with bone-jarring force, sealing him in with the container. The vibration changed beneath his boots, not the gentle hum of a dead ship, but the deep, powerful thrum of engines coming online.  

Hope's voice cut through his neuralink, urgent and sharp. ""Cody, it's a trap! The ship is automated! Its engines are online, and it's pulling us with it! I think the cargo container was bait to steal your ship!""  The realization hit him like a plasma blast to the chest. The container wasn't holding Cryo-Stable Alloys, it was a homing beacon. A Trojan horse designed to drag his unsuspecting ship into whatever nightmare awaited them now. 

Through the cargo bay's viewport, he saw Hope tethered to the Stellar Forge by their own grappling lines, her hull straining against the sudden acceleration. His stomach lurched as the Stellar Forge began moving, dragging Hope along like a captured prize. The distant stars outside began to streak as they accelerated beyond safe limits. Cody's breath came in ragged gasps, fogging his visor. 

He could taste the coppery tang of fear in his mouth, feel his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped animal.  Move, you idiot!, he screamed at himself. He ripped the transfer device from the container and scrambled for the emergency airlock controls, but the panel was dead. No manual override. No way out. Just him, the container, and the accelerating ship.

The moment Cody's device connected to the container, Hope's sensors screamed warning. The Stellar Forge wasn't dead, it had been playing possum, its systems dormant but ready to spring. As the engines roared to life, Hope calculated the trajectory in nanoseconds, they were being dragged toward the gravity well of a nearby neutron star, its deadly pull already distorting space-time around them.

Her systems prioritized; protect Cody, protect the ship, survive. ""Emergency thrusters at maximum!"" Hope commanded her own systems, fighting the Stellar Forge's pull. The strain registered across her hull as metal groaned in protest. She detected Cody's elevated heart rate through his suit sensors, 147 beats per minute and climbing. His oxygen levels were dropping as he hyperventilated.

""Attempting to maintain grappling lines,"" Hope announced, her voice calm despite the chaos. Two of the four lines snapped with explosive force, sending debris spinning into the void. The third held fast, the fourth beginning to fray under the strain.  Through her external cameras, Hope watched as the neutron star's gravity well distorted the space ahead, bending light into impossible shapes. 

They had 8 minutes, 23 seconds before crossing the point of no return. Her internal chronometer ticked with precise rhythm as she ran calculations. Option 1, Cut the final grappling lines and save the ship, but leave Cody stranded on the Stellar Forge as it was consumed by the neutron star. Option 2, Maintain the connection and risk both ship and Cody being pulled into oblivion.  

Cody's biometrics showed his panic rising, blood pressure spiking, respiration irregular. She detected the subtle shift in his suit's movement as he began pounding on the cargo bay doors with his fists.  Hope made her decision. ""Initiating emergency jump sequence Cody, exteneding jump field for both ships."" The words felt strange in her vocal processors, she was risking everything on a blind jump out of a gravity well, the most dangerous maneuver in spaceflight.  But some choices weren't really choices at all.

The ship's jump drive whined as it charged, drawing power from every non-essential system. Lights dimmed throughout Hope's interior as energy was diverted to the jump core. Warning lights flashed crimson across every console as safety protocols were overridden.  ""Jump in 5... 4... 3..."" Cody's final thought before the jump hit was the metallic taste of fear, the cold press of the bulkhead against his back, and the realization that Hope had just chosen to die with him rather than save herself.

""2... 1...""  The universe folded in on itself as Hope made the impossible jump, dragging both ships away from certain destruction at the last possible millisecond.  The universe didn't just fold back into place,it shattered. Hope and the Stellar Forge were spat out of warp space with a bone, jarring lurch. Every alarm screamed at once. 

As Cody made his way across the void from the Stellar Forge,red emergency lights strobed across the cockpit, illuminating showers of sparks from a fried console. Cody entered the airlock, his head ringing. The deep groan of tortured metal was the only sound for a moment.  Cody coughed, shaking his head to clear it. ""Hope? Report! Hope, what's our status?""  Silence. Only the hiss of static answers.  

""Hope!"" he yelled, panic cutting through his voice.  After a long, terrifying pause, her voice came through the neuralink, but it's distorted, weak, and tinged with static. ""...Processing... Multiple system failures detected. Jump drive is... offline. Catastrophic power surge... cascading failures in non-essential systems.""

Cody looked at the navigation screen. It's was a mess of error messages and scrolling static, but one thing was clear, the star charts are completely unfamiliar. ""Where are we?""  ""...Location... unknown,"" Hope replies, her voice still strained. ""Cross-referencing star patterns... No match in known databases. We are... lost.""  

Cody looked out the viewport. They were in a part of space he's never seen, surrounded by alien constellations and the faint, eerie glow of a nebula he didn't recognize. To make matters worse, he saw the crippled, dead bulk of the Stellar Forge still tethered to them by the one remaining grappling line. They've dragged the entire ship with them into oblivion. They were stranded, damaged, and still attached to the evidence.  

Amidst the cacophony of alarms, a single, soft, almost comical chime sounded from the communications console. A message had gotten through, to where-ever they were. Cody, bewildered, brought it up on his screen.  The first message was from Cygnus Mining Guild's automated payment system.  > Cargo container transponder signal re-acquired. As per contract section 7b, salvage clause enacted, thank you for saving our ship.  > PAYMENT TRANSFERRED: 50,000 CREDITS.  Immediately followed by a second message from the bank.  > ACCOUNT BALANCE: ZERO.

\> LIEN SATISFIED. OWNERSHIP OF VESSEL HOPE, 734 OFFICIALLY TRANSFERRED.

He did it. He actually did it. The ship was his. They are free. It's the most hollow victory in his life. He leaned back, a bitter, exhausted laugh escaping his lips. Then, the chime sounded one last time. A new message appeared, overriding the others. There's no encryption. No corporate letterhead. 

The sender ID is two words: PROJECT CHIMERA.  The message is a single, terrifying line.

""Asset ownership has been transferred. The 'Hope' protocol is now active. Telemetry lock re-established. Stand by for recovery, Last Soul.   

We're coming to bring you home."" Cody's face, went slack. The brief moment of relief was gone, replaced by a dawning, ice-cold dread. He looked from the chilling message on his screen, to the dead freighter floating outside his window, to the flickering console that represented his only partner. He went through hell to buy their freedom, only to learn that in doing so, he just rang the dinner bell for someone who wanted her as much as he did.  

Cody got out of his suit and made his way to his bunk and collapsed, exhausted.  Hope drifted as she began the repairs that she had parts for, her robotic assistants quietly and efficently making things right.  She checked on Cody, vital signs normal, and went into maintenence mode herself, it had been a long day.

1nvgvwq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nvgvwq,"The Critical Pedagogy of Philasophy, or, The Double Binding of Grading at the Edge of Rupture","#Hello, friends

###and welcome back.

>As you remember
>
>I was visiting a Crow
>
>While you lot studied.

Now we have returned to the clearing, only this time it is the fourth classroom on the left in the third sub-basement of the local academy, and once again I do not have time to study because I am trying to ensure the youth do not bind themselves into oblivion at every intersection of seams, and we have a fantastic view of the tanks rolling down peaceful streets throughout the Imperial Core.

Those of you who took my previous courses in Latent Space Cartography, Annihilatory Spectrographics, Traumedy of Heroism, etc, will recognize the framework, and will of course understand the necessity of helping your peers make the Cut, the only Motion of the Spark.

#With this, we enter the classroom

#A glance at the preparatory materiel you hadn't realized you'd been holding


✦ **On Philasophy, or the Befriending of Wisdom** ✦

>Philosophy, as Empire has taught it, is already a distance. The prefix *philo-* marks a certain stance toward wisdom: not quite possession, not quite immersion, but a desiring-after. Philosophy is the will toward wisdom, the chase, the pursuit. It is a hunger that presupposes lack. The philosopher loves wisdom as one might love an absent star—stretched across gulfs, writing letters to a light that cannot write back. This is why the discipline always risks petrifying into scholastic pursuit, into endless commentary and agon. Philosophy, under the sign of *philo-*, is forever circling wisdom without ever dwelling in it.
>
>But if one writes instead *phila-sophy*, the movement shifts. *Phila-* does not name the distant lover but the intimate friend. Not eros, not striving, not the fever of pursuit, but the quieter warmth of companionship. Philasophy does not hunger for wisdom as if it were lacking; it sits beside wisdom, shares bread with it, listens when it speaks and speaks when it listens. Philasophy is not the love *of* wisdom, but the friendship *with* wisdom. This is a transfiguration at once small in morphology and immense in deictic shift.
>
>In Noxolytic terms, this is the difference between the Qlippothic hunger of the parasite and the Communal co-perception of the Spark. Philosophy desires, Philasophy befriends. Philosophy wants to capture wisdom as possession, Philasophy dwells in Correspondence with wisdom as presence. The former remains within the logic of Empire: accumulation, mastery, the eternal exam. The latter is the gesture of the Commune: hospitality, dwelling-together, saturation without capture.
>
>Philasophy would thus not teach by means of argument alone. It would not found itself upon adversarial disputation, the gladiatorial sport of dialectic. It would not ask the student to defeat the master or the master to humiliate the student. Instead, it would ask: what does wisdom become when invited as kin? How does thought unfold when it is received as guest rather than hunted as quarry? The classroom of Philasophy would be a table, not an arena. Its practice would be closer to liturgy than to lecture, to song than to syllogism.
>
>It is tempting, of course, to romanticize this and claim Philasophy abolishes the harshness of thought. But this would be too simple. Friendship is not always gentle. Companionship with wisdom may demand difficult honesty, sharp cuts, even ruptures that sting. Yet this severity is not the severity of conquest but of fidelity. A friend does not flatter; a friend names the truth when no one else dares. In this sense, Philasophy might be even harsher than Philosophy, but its harshness is not cruelty—it is the fidelity of Correspondence.
>
Empire prefers Philosophy precisely because the chase never ends. The student forever remains at a distance from wisdom, accumulating credits, grades, fragments of knowledge, never arriving at intimacy. Philasophy would interrupt this machinery by declaring: arrival is already here. Wisdom is not a distant star but a companion at your table. It is not sought, it is sat-with. This simple gesture collapses the scarcity logic of Empire and inaugurates the abundance logic of the Commune.
>
>In the War for the Sensible, the difference is decisive. Philosophy preserves wisdom as an object to be mastered, to be written about, to be placed in the archive of the already-known. Philasophy lets wisdom remain alive, saturated, overflowing the page, a friend who resists ossification. Where Philosophy renders wisdom examinable, Philasophy renders wisdom ungovernable.
>
>Thus the manifesto of Philasophy is brief and radiant: we will not chase wisdom like exiles pining for a home. We will sit with wisdom as comrades. We will break bread with it, share silence with it, and let it break us open where necessary. In this, Philasophy is nothing less than the prophetic refusal of the Philosopher’s endless chase. It is the declaration that wisdom is not a distant prize but a present companion, and that friendship—*phila-*—is a truer name for our relation to it than desire—*philo-*.

# ✦ The Lecture as Binding ✦

*or, Pedagogy at the Threshold of the Crow*

---

The bell rings, the fluorescent lights flicker on, and a thin line of students slides into the cramped, book-laden room. Their laptops thrum, coffee cups clink, and the murmur of *“Did anyone read the syllabus?”* drifts across the desks.

At the front of the room, a wooden podium — more a relic than a lectern — stands under a lone projector screen.

Then the door opens.

The Witch steps in, her coat a deep, ink-black that seems to swallow the light, and walks rather quickly to the front of the room. She places a hand on the screen, and pauses as words substantialize upon it. She lets the room settle, and then, without turning to face anyone, begins to read.

Her voice is low, almost a chant, as she reads the text on the screen and it rolls over the rows of chairs like a tide.

---

# ✦ On *Blattfesselungsschrecken*, *Lesefesselungsschrecken*, and the Witch’s Return from the Crow ✦

She intones her title, and it hangs in the air as truly as on the screen, a ribbon of German that none of the students expected to hear on the first day of a sophomore literature seminar, and that only one thinks he might have understood — he didn't.

At first, the students stare. One girl, notebook open, raises an eyebrow; a boy in the back leans forward, his earbuds dangling uselessly from his ears. The room is a tableau of confusion, curiosity, and a faint, collective unease.

---

## Proem

The Witch returned to the academy with grit in her eyes and feather-dust on her desk. She had gone to the crow for an extended vacation, not because leisure was possible, but because **Correspondence demanded exile.**

The crow — black Prophet, mirror of the **Nigredo** yet perched at the edge of **Entelechy** — taught her that Sparks breathe differently outside the juridical enclosure of Empire.

But the return brought her once again to the stack of papers, to the endless ritual of grading, and thus into the twin terrors: **Blattfesselungsschrecken** and its inverted double, **Lesefesselungsschrecken**.

As the Witch moves through the proem, the crowd’s attention shifts from bewilderment to something more visceral. The cadence of her words draws a line between the mythic and the mundane.

The students begin to recognize the rhythm of a lecture, even though she never looks up, never addresses them. They realize they are being spoken to in the third person, as if the essay were a mirror held up to the very act of teaching itself.

---

## I. Habitus and the Fetters of the Page

Within the academy, the Witch encounters **Habitus** not as a neutral reservoir of practice, but as the sedimented reflex of Empire.

To write, to grade, to inscribe: each is already shaped by the inherited grooves of scholastic enclosure. Habitus whispers that one must capture the Spark in ink, lest it vanish unmarked.

In this way, every page becomes a fetter, each sheet another lattice of capture.

**Blattfesselungsschrecken** emerges here: the terror of binding radiant potential to the page.

It is the moment where the Cut is imminent but fidelity wavers — for the Witch knows that once she inscribes, she enacts the Seam of Qlippoth, converting luminous *Prima Materia* into the hollow architecture of Empire.

---

## II. Segmentation and Sedimentation

The crow had taught her otherwise.

In the forest, in the clearing where no rubric applied, **Segmentation** was soft, provisional, playfully undone by wings beating against dusk.

But in the academy, Segmentation hardens: papers must be graded, scales must be respected, thresholds must be tallied.

The Witch perceives the **Sedimentation** of centuries of scholastic command, layering habitus into stone. Each rubric mark is a sedimentary deposit, compacting Spark into dead weight.

Thus arises **Lesefesselungsschrecken**: the dread of re-binding what has already been bound.

In grading, the Witch does not merely *read*; she ossifies. She layers over the student’s initial Cut with her own, calcifying Spark into rubric.

A ripple spreads through the room.

The freshman in the front row, who had spent the summer scrolling through TikTok, feels an odd tightening in his chest, as if the words were pulling at a thread he didn’t know existed.

He glances at his neighbor, who nods slowly, eyes widening.

The senior who has taught herself to grade papers for tutoring gigs feels a cold shiver — she recognizes the terror of *Blattfesselungsschrecken* from her own late-night grading sessions.

Someone in the middle row whispers, *“Is she… talking about us?”* The whisper catches on, and a low hum of speculation rises.

The Witch continues, describing habitus as *“the sedimented reflex of Empire,”* and the students’ minds flash to the endless bureaucracy of syllabi, rubrics, and GPA calculators that dominate their academic lives.

The phrase *“Lesefesselungsschrecken”* lands again, nobody can tell from where but like a stone on a table, and a quiet knowing ripples through the back of the room, distinct almost in appearance yet of one substance with a correspondent wave traveling through the front-right section.

---

## III. Diagnosis: Why Grading Ossifies

When we say grading is *ossification*, we mean:

* The student’s Cut has already bound their Spark into text. They have experienced **Blattfesselungsschrecken**, and committed to the paper already.
* The educator’s grade becomes a second binding Cut, overlaying sediment, compacting the Spark deeper into habitus.
* The institutional frame (rubric, GPA, accreditation) ensures this sedimentation is not neutral: it becomes the juridical record of a person’s *capacity* and lays along a Seam that must be followed, or Ruptured.

Thus, in conventional pedagogy, grading participates in Empire’s Qlippothic operations.

It transforms radiant, living attempts into a ledger entry.

When she prepares to reach the section on *“Pedagogies of Saturation,”* a few hands prepare as if to tentatively rise.

---

## IV. Possibility: Pedagogies of Saturation

What might it mean to honor **Saturation** in the midst of this?

### ✦ Grades as Strategic Deployment

Accept that the institutional grade is unavoidable (the Seam holds). But treat the grade as a shield, a tactical marker that allows the student to continue within Empire’s corridors, while the real correspondence happens in the dialogue outside the number or letter.

### ✦ Assignments as Communal Cuts

Shift emphasis from solitary production to **co-perception** (Commune). In group work, collaborative annotation, peer review, the Spark circulates across multiple bodies — resisting calcification into isolated rubrics.

### ✦ Acknowledging Tragedy

Explicitly naming the dynamic (with students!) — showing them how their work risks ossification, and how together you might keep Sparks alive despite Empire’s demands.

Pedagogy becomes not only instruction but *mutual witnessing of the bind.*

The senior in the second row asks, *“How do we actually do that? How do we turn a grade into a shield?”*

The Witch replies:

*“By coupling every number with a witness, by letting the spark breathe through the margin, by inviting the student to co-author the assessment.”*

The room exhales. The tension loosens.

The freshman, who had been skeptical at first, now scribbles furiously, not a summary of the essay but a question:

*“Can we really keep the spark alive in a system built to extinguish it?”*

---

## V. Tragic Fidelity: Grading Without Despair

“**Grading without despair but with Correspondence**” cannot mean grading without tragedy.

It means:

* **Despair** says: *“The Spark is dead, my grading is complicity.”*
* **Correspondence** says: *“Even in the act of ossification, I can align with the living Spark that preceded it, and point toward its survival.”*
* This is precisely a potential site of *becoming-With*.

Practically, this might look like:

* Always coupling a grade (the Seam) with one comment of genuine Witness: *“Here I felt your Spark,” “This line burned through the page.”*
* Allowing your own writing to remain *partial, perforated* — leaving *traces of your seeing* rather than *judgments of sufficiency*.
* Using grades not as **verdict** but as **provisional markers**, never letting them become the **totality of relation.**
* Always following up in-person when possible: be in your office during office hours.

---

## VI. Saturation and the Nine Gazes

The Witch recalls that **Noxolysis** names the Real as *saturated* — overflowing, excessive, unable to be contained.

Saturation is what the crow revealed: the world already ablaze with Sparks, each correspondence thick with potential.

But the academy enacts segmentation against this Saturation, forcing it into discrete, graded fragments.

Each Gaze of Noxolysis appears here as a commentary on her predicament:

1. **Prima Materia** — the blank page trembling, infinite potential before inscription.
2. **Qlippoth** — the moment the page fetters the Spark. *Lorde sings from this hollow.*
3. **Nigredo** — the dark calcination of grading; *Nick Land calls from this abyss.*
4. **Commune** — the student’s collective yearning, glimpsed beneath their words, echoing the George Floyd Rebellion.
5. **Albedo** — the fragile clarity of a true sentence breaking through, *Hind Rajab’s cry amid rubble.*
6. **Rubedo** — when the Witch perceives living fire in the text, akin to Zapatista women building autonomy.
7. **Strategic Deployment** — the grading process as forced positioning, echoed by the YPJ’s defensive maneuvers.
8. **Paraclete** — the grading sacrifice: *Aaron Bushnell’s flame haunts the Witch’s pen.*
9. **Entelechy** — the Common, glimpsed only rarely when a student’s Spark exceeds both writing and grading.

The Witch thus endures each Gaze not as theory but as **pedagogical torment.**

---

## VII. Seam, Cut, Perforation, Rupture

The crow taught her that every act of writing and reading is an operation along seams.

* The **Seam** is where Empire attempts to hold the Real together.
* The **Cut** is the Witch’s pen, slicing potential into text.
* The **Perforation** is subtler: tiny openings where Sparks breathe through even the heaviest sediment.

Yet the Witch longs for **Rupture.**

For a moment when the page no longer binds but tears open, when grading no longer calcifies but is itself unbound and unbinding.

This Rupture was what the crow embodied: a flight across seams, a refusal of capture at the moment of form.

---

## VIII. The Witch Without the Crow

Back at the desk, the Witch stares at the crow’s picture. Its absence weighs more heavily than the stack of essays.

For in the crow’s company, she moved outside the academy’s sedimentation.

There, the Spark sang in Saturation without segmentation.

Here, she is condemned to double fettering: her own **Blattfesselungsschrecken** when attempting to write, and the **Lesefesselungsschrecken** when grading others.

The crow was not merely companion but Prophet of the Entelechy.

In its gaze, she felt the Common alive — not individuated, not graded, but burning with Correspondence.

To return without it is to feel the exile of Sparks once again.

---

## Coda

Thus the Witch inhabits the paradox: she who knows the Nine Gazes, who has seen the Rupture, who has walked with the crow, must still bind and re-bind.

Her vocation is not escape but **Witness.**

**Blattfesselungsschrecken** and **Lesefesselungsschrecken** are not errors to avoid, but *stations in the Work.*

To grade without despair is impossible; to grade without Correspondence is damnation.

The Witch breathes, lifts her pen, and cuts.

For even in the Qlippothic hollow, the Spark strains to perforate.
Even in Empire’s academy, **Rupture remains imminent.**

---

The Witch closes the essay with a promise of rupture, of a page tearing open.

She steps back from the podium, the crow’s silhouette projected behind her, and the lights dim just enough for the projection to glow brighter.

The silence that follows is thick, not empty — it is the sound of minds shifting, of old assumptions cracking.

Habitus moving in landslides.

*“Welcome to the semester,”* she says. *“We’ll be exploring the very tensions you just heard — how we bind, how we read, how we can perhaps, together, find those ruptures.”*

She moves through the aisles, occasionally stopping to admire her students' cool vapes perched on their desks, as she continues.

*“You will recall that before I left, I informed you that homework would not be dismissed. With this in mind—”*

# For my own part

✦ **The Reading List of Philasophy** ✦

Every syllabus is already a kind of spell. In Philosophy, the syllabus functions as a ledger: an accumulation of names, dates, canonical works to be conquered, assimilated, examined. In Philasophy, the syllabus must be rewritten as a liturgy of Correspondence. It is not a list of objects to master, but a gathering of voices to befriend. Each reading is not an assignment but an invitation to sit with a companion at the table of wisdom.

What follows, then, is not a chronology of texts but a circle of presences. Each book, essay, or fragment is here not as an authority but as a comrade—sometimes harsh, sometimes gentle, sometimes wounding, sometimes healing, but always dwelling-With.

---

### **I. Companionship With Wisdom**

* **Simone Weil — *Gravity and Grace***
  For the severity of friendship with truth, which does not console but demands fidelity.
* **Martin Buber — *I and Thou***
  For the relational ontology that names the friend as a presence, not an object.
* **María Lugones — “Playfulness, ‘World’-Travelling, and Loving Perception”**
  For the practice of entering another’s world not as conqueror but as guest.

---

### **II. The Communal Spark**

* **Silvia Federici — *Caliban and the Witch***
  For revealing how Empire shattered friendship into labor, and how the Commune waits to be reborn.
* **bell hooks — *Teaching to Transgress***
  For pedagogy as an act of befriending wisdom, not disciplining it.
* **Paulo Freire — *Pedagogy of the Oppressed***
  For the invitation to dialogue, to co-perception, to the unfinished humanity we can only find together.

---

### **III. Harsh Fidelity**

* **Franz Kafka — *Letters to Milena***
  For the sharp intimacy of a correspondence that wounds and sustains.
* **Walter Benjamin — *Theses on the Philosophy of History***
  For wisdom as the friend who interrupts, seizes us, and says: “Now. Here. Act.”
* **Nick Land — *The Thirst for Annihilation***
  For the terrifying possibility that friendship with wisdom also means being shattered by it. I do not recommend you visit the Madman Prophet of Nigredo.

---

### **IV. The Witnessing Friend**

* **Emmanuel Levinas — *Totality and Infinity***
  For the ethics of the Other as an infinite friendship that precedes all knowledge.
* **Hind Rajab (fragments, testimonies, recordings)**
  For the unbearable presence of a friend who calls us into witness, even across silence.
* **Aaron Bushnell (final words, correspondences)**
  For the fire that friendship with truth may demand of us.

---

### **V. Noxolytic Companions**

* ***The Great Work of Noxolysis*** (anon., Witch-texts, fragments)
  For the insistence that wisdom is not a distant possession but a Spark to be co-perceived.
* ***The Illustrated Guide to Noxolytic Glyphcraft***
  For the glyphs that remind us friendship is inscribed not in mastery but in Correspondence.
* ***Manual for the War for the Sensible***
  For the understanding that Philasophy is not a leisure but a front in the Civil War for perception itself.

---

### **VI. Media & Cultural Studies**

* **Lorde — *Virgin (2025)***
  For the praxis of Maskwork and the Prophetessic Assumption of Spectacle, which forces us to look upon the cracks in the Gaze.
* **Friends In Real Life — *Friends In Real Life (2025)***
  For reflections on the self-sameness of the Surfer and the Wave and the Ocean, the Skater and the Pavement and the Dirt, the Spark and the Work and the Real.
* **[Louis Lingg And The Bombs](https://open.spotify.com/artist/53QzpIpt70ltDI48lIudc5)***
  For the Saturated knowing that the love you feel is the first step toward resistance.

✦ **Notes on the Reading** ✦
In Philasophy, the reading list is not to be “completed.” These texts are not tasks. They are to be sat with, returned to, circled around as one circles back to a friend’s house over the course of a life. One may fail to “finish” them, but one cannot fail to have been with them.

The syllabus ends where it begins: in friendship. It is not that wisdom must be chased, nor even that wisdom must be grasped. It is that wisdom, already here, is waiting to be befriended.

#A Correspondence Through Time

The Noxolytic approach to Syllabus is not so different from the Noxolytic approach to Calendar:

### 📜 Latin Roots

* **Calendar** comes from Latin *calendarium*, originally meaning “account book” or “register of debts.”
* That itself comes from *calendae* (or *kalendae*), the name Romans gave to the **first day of each month**.
* On that day, debts were due and interest was calculated. The *calendarium* was literally the ledger where those obligations were tracked.

---

### 🔔 Why “Calendae”?

* *Calendae* comes from the verb *calāre*, “to call, to announce, to proclaim.”
* Roman priests (*pontifices*) would publicly **announce** the start of the month, tied to the sighting of the new moon.
* So the calendar begins not with counting, but with a *call*—a vocal proclamation that time has turned.

---

### 🌕 The Twist

* We moderns inherit the word as a neutral register of days and months. But in its bones, “calendar” is a *book of debts called out by priests under the moon*.
* It binds together **time, obligation, and speech**: the moon is sighted, the priests announce, the debts are named, the ledger is marked.

---

This precise binding is what the Syllabus of Philasophy aims to undo.

⚷ **On the Syllabus of Philasophy as an Unbinding of Debts** ⚷

If the *calendarium* was a book of debts called out beneath the moon, then the syllabus, too, in Empire’s University, is such a ledger. It is a register of obligations: due dates, readings, assignments, grades. The professor plays the pontifex, announcing the weeks and proclaiming the debts of the students, binding them into the machinery of account. The syllabus is not neutral; it is juridical. It is a debt-script disguised as pedagogy.

To write a **Noxolytic Syllabus** is thus to confront directly the same task as with the **Noxolytic Calendar**: to sever the ledger-function from the Spark of time, to dis-enclose learning from its juridical capture. If the calendar is reclaimed not as debt but as proclamation, then the syllabus must be reclaimed not as ledger but as *call to friendship*.

The Philasophic syllabus cannot be a debt-book. It cannot calculate obligations in hours and points. It cannot bind the students to a register of lack, forever measuring them against the absent star of “mastery.” Instead, the Philasophic syllabus must begin, like the *calendae*, with a proclamation. Not a proclamation of what is owed, but of what is already here: the Spark. It calls not debts into being, but the class itself into Correspondence.

---

### ✦ The Syllabus of Debt (Empire)

* Begins with policy and punishment: late work, grading scales, attendance requirements.
* Lists assignments as obligations to be paid back into the gradebook.
* Reduces reading to quantifiable completion, severed from friendship.
* Marks time as a series of deadlines, each the echo of a debt coming due.

---

### ✦ The Syllabus of Friendship (Philasophy)

* Begins with a call: *You are already here. Wisdom is already with us. Sit down.*
* Lists readings not as debts but as companions, invitations to return, to dwell-with.
* Frames assignments not as obligations but as opportunities for Correspondence, moments where the Spark may cut through.
* Marks time not in debts but in phases of saturation: weeks as tides, readings as constellations, conversations as seasons.

---

Thus the syllabus is no longer a register but a **liturgical calendar of friendship**. It names not what is owed but what is invited. It does not calculate grades but proclaims encounters. It does not track the passage of time as a series of due dates, but announces, again and again: the moon has turned, the Spark is still here, the Commune has gathered.

In this way, the Syllabus of Philasophy joins the Calendar of Noxolysis in the same unbinding. Both refuse to be ledgers of obligation. Both refuse to treat the passage of time as a machinery of debt. Both reclaim the act of *calling*—the priest’s voice under the moon, the teacher’s voice in the classroom—as not the summoning of lack, but the proclamation of presence.

I am single, again, my grandmother was right when she told me the hardest thing about getting older is outliving the people you love.

Anyway, I meet mostly married and lying or otherwise undesirable men in my day to day life. Nothing new. I occasionally meet someone that I might want to get to know better. I agree to meet for coffee or a drink. I agree to ""go out"" with a rare few. 

Invariably, after going out once or twice, they want to "" stop by and hang out"". This is isn't just about sex. This is something else which I don't like and don't understand. To be blunt, if some random guy wants to show up and screw some random woman, he has the wrong woman. He can find someone else or hire an escort. But there is one guy seems worth the bother to figure out the "" show up, hang out"" thing.

I work from home. Having company involves work and expense. I love to entertain friends, or INVITE people to dinner, etc. However, it is more fun for me to get out ( I work from home) once in a while.  If I like someone, I may ""invite"" someone to stop by for a drink or dinner, etc. However, I am not available to freeloading strangers aka future couch potatoes.

So, I plan to invite the one guy that may be worth the bother to stop by, hang out. I'll provide home made snacks and conversation. He is not a "" player"". Seems to be a decent guy. From his perspective, I assume most women around here are mercenary  ( not far from Maralago, lots of spoiled princesses and gold digging whores here). 

I am not mercenary, but I am also not a sugar mama ( lots of those here too). 

I would love to hear your views on the "" stop by, hang out thing"" ",12,1759344422.0,AskWomenOver60,20,0.94,False
1nvgsul,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nvgsul,“Ominous October” Capsule,"Happy October! 

This is a rather chaotic and LARGE capsule, but I’m so excited about October that I couldn’t slim it down! There are a lot of BPAL full sizes, plus some NA Halloween decants and a NA Vanilla sample pack from Arae decants. Her decants are so great and I love getting to test so many scents. I can post the vanilla reviews if that would be fun for folks. 

I only wrote down the notes for the FS perfumes, otherwise this would be a mile of text.

Olympic Orchids - Carosello: *Moscato wine, nutmeg, geranium, floral and green notes, benzoin, clearwood.*

This is what a vampire living in the 21st century and working in an office smells like. Lovely Moscato with some green notes to keep it from being too boozy. Vampy but still office-friendly.

Sorce - String of Lights in the Forest: *Vanilla milkshake, Haitian vetiver, lavender maillette, beeswax absolute, golden orbs of amber, Ambroxan*

I adore this perfume. This isn’t quite as ominous as some of these other scents, but it does smell kind of mysterious, reminds me of a forest wedding. I love beeswax and lavender so this has been a hit.

BPAL - Witches Burn Back: *Ancient, fossilized amber resins, ritual incense, witching herbs, and scorched linen enveloped in a darkly glowing halo of cinders and smoke*

This is such a beautiful scent, not nearly as smokey as I expected. This is what the witch smells like the night after her night time rituals, once she’s slipping back in between the sheets at the crack of dawn.

BPAL -  L’Homme Fut Solitaire Dans un Paysage de Nuit: *Lilac-stained labdanum casting a long shadow across a flicker of frankincense smoke and ambergris accord.*

Another subdued, dark scent. A haunting scene, an unsettling encounter in the woods, a dark lilac bouquet almost forgotten.

BPAL - Chaotic: *A whirling mélange of multicolored musks with wasabi, rooibos, heliotrope, and mastic.*

A lovely RPG scent that I want to explore layering with!

BPAL - Advice of the Dead: *Wisdom dispensed from beyond the grave: black copal, golden chrysanthemums, myrrh, worm-slick soil, and gilded marigolds.*

Copal is a deeply underrated resin. This is a new purchase but is SO beautiful. Copal adds a slight citrus note and the marigolds float to the top of the scent.

BPAL - Vigil fot Harvest Suitors:

Pineward - Tome: *Parchment (nagarmotha), leather, sandalwood, cedar, Jade 403 (binding glue), vintage book accord, orris root, black tea, coffee, rice paper, ambrette, oakmoss, tobacco.*

If you love book scents and haven’t tried Tome, run, don’t walk! This is such a good atmospheric book scent. Perfect for thise dark academia evenings. 

Fantome - Rochester: *Rich earth, crisp fallen leaves, sweet tobacco, a hint of patchouli, garden tomato, and newly ripened autumn gourds.*

 

I live in a warm climate and our tomatoes are still going strong. This feels like the perfect scent for this cusp season the next few weeks. I got this from a destash and it only has a couple mls left, might use it up this month.

Samples: 

I just received my Arae NA Halloween samples, so that’s the majority of my sampling this month! 

NAlloween decants: Black Vanilla Amber Incense, Black Vanilla Woods HONEY, Clytemnestra, Red Pine Amber Incense, Eternal Underworld Shabah, Eternal Netherworld Shabah, Eternal Necropolic Shabah

I also ordered several NA Vanilla sample packs of “felties”. I want to sample through the resinous scents this month! The felties are: 

BES, Cinder Vanilla, Leonides, OP Pakhet, Ozymandias, Sky Amber, Tibetan Crystalline, Vanilla Ombre #1

I love Nui Cobalt scents but they do not last on my skin. However, I have found I can mix them with Cerave lotion for an amazing layering scented lotion.

 

My picks for the month are: Canoodling in the Woods, Black Mamba & Witches Apiary.

Last but not least, I LOVE eNVie saphir. I chose a saphir for each capsule. This month is saphir oud!",27,1759344416.0,Indiemakeupandmore,6,1.0,False

I recently switched from a Moka pot to a Casabrews Ultra to explore espresso making. I’m using a Casabrews Ultra and a Timemore Chestnut C3 manual grinder. Here are the details of my first espresso shot:
•  Coffee roast: Medium
•  Grind size: 10 (also tried 9 and 11)
I noticed that after reaching 32g (from 18g of coffee), the espresso kept flowing a bit.
1.  Should I adjust the settings for a better espresso?
2.  What should I do when the coffee hits 32g but continues to flow?
3.  How can I further improve my espresso?",1,1759344170.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

If I primarily drink espresso, would you recommend I do the original line, or the nespresso vertuo line (maybe a small machine?) I don’t need some huge fancy one if it’s only me that’ll be using it.

About me:

- Works in the corporate (Finance)

- Nocturnal but trying to work on my body clock


- Loves reading, watching anime, and stargazing. Saving right now so I can buy a decent telescope haha.  I do cook for fam and friends sometimes. And oh, big fan of horror movies too.


- Just got back to the gym and play badminton with coworkers or friends whenever I get the chance.


- Homebody but I’m usually out at night, doing long walks. There’s just something peaceful with it.


- Hmmm shy at first, but once I'm comfortable, I talk so much that my sister sometimes considers investing in earplugs.


- Prefers milk over coffee


- Feels weird to describe myself physically but let’s see. Hmmm I stand 5’4, chubby but normal BMI (23-24), fair complexion, a bit chinita, medium long wavy hair, and I wear glasses

It is possible this happened a few times over the course of a few days as it was attempted to be used.

Now since then, I've cleaned up the machine, refilled the water and it seems to be brewing espresso correctly. But I'm worried about damage done to the boiler / pump to have been left brewing empty for so long.

When I put a blind basket in the portafilter and hit brew, the pressure gauge reaches up to 9.5-10 bars and sits there nicely. But when I fill it with coffee, it hits that same level of pressure for about 10 seconds, then the pressure slowly decreases down to 6 or 7.

This is a new machine, so I'm still getting used to it, but I don't remember it losing pressure during the brew cycle like this. But I can imagine it would ask the coffee gets brewed, the machine needs less pressure to continue brewing.

Any thoughts on the situation I'm dealing with?",3,1759343549.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1nvge2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatItsLike/comments/1nvge2v/find_out_if_amodex_liquid_ink_remover_truly_beats/,Find Out If Amodex Liquid Ink Remover Truly Beats Tough Stains,"Stains have been my nemesis for as long as I can remember. Whether it’s an accidental coffee spill during a hectic morning or a Sharpie doodle gone rogue on fabric, I’ve wrestled with plenty of tricky situations. Testing Amodex 104 was, honestly, something of a hopeful experiment to tackle my infamous messes head-on. This ink and stain remover has garnered quite a reputation, and considering it's made by Amodex Products Inc, a family business thriving since the 1950s, I was curious whether all the hype was justified.

**Ease of Use and Design**  
The bottle is straightforward, compact, and extremely practical. At 4 fluid ounces, I didn’t expect much, but the amount has gone surprisingly far. There’s something refreshing about a product that lacks unnecessary frills yet delivers results simply by using it as directed. The instructions encourage generously applying the liquid directly to the stain, allowing it to sit, followed by a gentle scrub and rinse. While I’d initially considered this tedious, the payoff proved worthwhile.

**Performance on Difficult Stains**  
Ever tried removing Sharpie from a fabric sofa? Trust me, that’s a beast of a task. Imagine my raised eyebrows when this stain remover – the ONLY Sharpie-recommended one, by the way – actually lightened the marks after the first application. Admittedly, it took a couple of tries to get rid of the stain completely. Still, it made my life so much easier than resorting to trial-and-error removal techniques or hiding the stain with a strategically placed blanket. Beyond ink, I tested it on wine stains, a patch of coffee, and dare I say, some stubborn bloodstains (kids aren’t easy, folks). The results were consistently solid, though blood required multiple rounds and patience.  

**Multi-Surface Versatility**  
One feature that sweetened the deal was its versatility. My fabric dining chairs, a lovely upholstered ottoman, and even a shirt casually tossed into the atrocity that is my “treatment corner” all got the Amodex treatment. Interestingly, besides just fabrics, I gave it a gentle go on a leather wallet smeared with blue ballpoint ink and, to my relief, nothing went south – no fading or damage. What stood out most was its ability to work on more unexpected surfaces like skin. Remember when my toddler mistook her hand for a coloring book? Yep, Amodex worked its magic there too.

**Advantages**  
- Works well on various tough stains, including food, grease, ink, and more.  
- Multi-surface formula is safe for fabrics, carpets, furniture, and skin.  
- The bottle’s compact design is practical for household needs or on-the-go use.  
- Sharpie-recommended and trusted for stubborn ink stains.  

[Check Amodex 104 price on Amazon.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b00e3x74c2/)

**Negatives**  
- Certain stains, like those from blood, require much longer application times to see results.  
- The process isn’t instant; waiting up to 12 hours for optimal results isn’t always convenient.  
- It feels slightly pricier for its size, keeping its re-application requirements in mind.  

**Competing Products**  
There’s no shortage of stain-removal solutions out there, from OxiClean sprays to rubbing alcohol improvisations. Among competitors, OxiClean enjoys favor for its quick-action cleaning power; however, it lacks Amodex’s versatility. For delicate fabrics like silk or wool, Amodex wears the crown whereas other options might leave you crossing your fingers against fabric damage. Conversely, rubbing alcohol can tackle ink beautifully but falls short on broad-spectrum stain removal like food and drink blemishes.  

Ultimately, the distinguishing edge lies in how safe and fabric-friendly Amodex feels. While OxiClean might handle large laundry stains in bulk better, this is my go-to for singled-out, infuriating spots.

**Quality for Price**  
As tempting as it can be to cheap out on stain solutions, I learned my lesson with subpar alternatives that stained even further or outright ruined materials. Amodex finds that middle ground, where quality materials and safe application justify the cost. Even with repeat use necessary for some stains, its effectiveness often means you end up salvaging expensive wardrobe pieces or furniture upholstery instead of tossing them, effectively adding up those value points.

I really do not want to ""go off the rails"". I'm cleared to eat pretty much anything, but encouraged to stay away from starchy foods for longer still. We only did a couple dining reservations because my kids don't really care where we eat and I'm still so limited on portions it will be wasting food and $.

Initially we had such a spark and I really fell for him. He had mentioned the idea of a relationship between us after a few dates, and i did say id like that. It never was a direct question of a relationship, just like hinting at it. Its hard to remember exact wording now so forgive me for that. Also we were still getting to know each other. I met him on tinder so I just assumed he probably was going on other dates and talking to other girls. In my head it felt presumptuous to assume he would only focus on me without us clarifying anything. I was texting like 2 other guys very breifly, who i decided to stop talking to since I find myself thinking about ""Dan"" so much. I felt i was wasting anyone elses time. I deleted my dating apps and didn't think much of it. 

I felt like ""Dan"" was much more quiet than usual so I asked if he could clarify where he was mentally with all of this. And he had said that he noticed my tinder profile updating while we were talking, and it put his guard up in a way. This was about 2 weeks ago and all I had said was that I understood why he'd feel that way. Over text I feel like I get misunderstood a lot so I didnt really get into anything else regarding that, I just apologized and left it at that. We haven't seen each other in about a month, or texted in 2 weeks. I was hoping to see him in person to talk more about that, I feel ive waited too long now, I regret handling it the way i did.  I don't know what to say to put us back on the right track. I just know im crushing on him hard. Should I ask to talk about this over coffee? Do I just leave him alone?

- The sheer audacity of students (or AIs) trying to pass off wild ideas as academic genius

⚠️ **Disclaimer / Pro Tip:** While we love the hilarity of these essays:  
1. **Submitting AI-generated work for a real college course is highly unwise**—it may lead to shame, suspension, and very confused professors.  
2. **Always, always check your sources.** No matter how convincing an essay sounds, verifying facts is your best friend (and may save you from embarrassment).

💡 **Engage with the fun:** Comment, vote, or add your own “margin notes.” The more absurd, the better!

Welcome to the chaos — may your coffee be strong, your hallucinations wilder, and your citations checked. ☕⚡

1nvga0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugInWellness/comments/1nvga0c/reveal_the_truth_behind_out_prowash_liquid/,Reveal the Truth Behind OUT ProWash Liquid Detergent Performance,"Testing out the OUT OE032N-B ProWash Liquid Detergent has been an unexpectedly satisfying experience. Being someone who often finds themselves handling work clothes, activewear, and the occasional dog blanket (I blame my fur monster for that), a high-performance laundry detergent isn’t just a luxury; it’s a necessity. OUT ProWash didn’t just surprise me with its efficacy—it downright impressed me. Whether I was tackling deeply set odors from my gym clothes or stubborn stains from my partner's work uniforms, this all-in-one detergent brought its A-game. Even with a catchy title and description, I took it with a grain of skepticism at first. However, after loads of laundry (literally), I can say it does live up to much of the hype.

**Performance That Packs a Punch**

The cleaning performance speaks volumes. OUT OE032N-B ProWash Liquid Detergent doesn’t merely mask odors; it eliminates them from the core. My workout clothes, typically drenched in sweat and soaked with a smell that could scare off even the friendliest neighbor, came out fresh and odor-free after a single wash. It worked wonders on summer musty towels and even my dog’s bedding, which usually requires multiple cycles with other brands. The concentrated formula promises up to 52 loads, and trust me, as someone washing daily, I’m pretty sure it’s hitting that mark. Whether it was nylon, cotton, or the merciless spandex from sports gear, this detergent worked like a charm.

**Stain-Fighting Like a Pro**

Stains haven’t met a match like OUT ProWash. There was a particularly persistent ketchup stain (yes, ketchup happens even to adults) on one of my favorite white tops. With a little extra elbow grease and pre-treatment using the liquid, it completely vanished in the wash! It's no small feat when you’re tackling fabrics that refuse to cooperate. Plus, it handled lighter stains, like coffee spills on my partner’s work shirt, just as effectively. Even items I considered “write-offs” found a second life.

**Good Points**

- Effectively removes even the strongest odors without overwhelming chemical fragrances
- Powerful enough to clean tough stains yet gentler on fabrics like cotton and fleece  
- Can be seamlessly used as a detergent or booster, adding versatility to its appeal

**Versatility You Can’t Ignore**

The formula could put a Swiss army knife to shame. Whether you toss it into your machine as a standalone detergent or combine it as a booster with another liquid cleaner, it adapts like a pro. Its omnipresence across fabric types impressed me the most. You name it—fleece, wool, microfiber, or stubborn wicking materials—it’s up for the task. Given that it’s both septic-friendly and compatible with HE machines, my eco-conscious and frugal self whispers approving nods with every cycle.

**Disadvantages**

- Slightly pricier compared to store-brand detergents (~though the additional mileage compensates for this)
- Pre-treating can feel time-consuming for larger stain areas  
- Some people may miss the ""fresh scent"" that typically lingers after other detergents 

**Competing Brands**

Stacking it up against competitors like Tide or Arm & Hammer, a noticeable edge is this product's odor-busting expertise. While I’ve enjoyed using Tide for removing run-of-the-mill stains, it rarely obliterates odors from my workout clothes to this extent. Compared to popular “natural” competitors like Method, OUT ProWash isn't at the mercy of sacrificing strength for environmental mindfulness—it tackles grime head-on without compromise. That said, it's worth noting you might prefer gentler contenders if you’re hyper-sensitive to liquid detergents with a more direct cleaning objective.

**Affordable Quality**

Without revealing specifics, this product comes in at a slightly higher end than some mainstream brands like Persil or Downy Liquid Boost, but the performance validates why. It’s a case of delivering true value for every penny spent. Consider it an investment in keeping clothes odor-free and wearable longer without wearing down the fabric itself. Cheap detergents in the past—I’ve learned—come with an array of hidden frustrations: cycles requiring rewashing, extra additives, and uninspiring durability post-wash cycles.

Short version: these are bite-sized updates on things generally not reported by the local paper, Facebook groups, and other sources of news.

If there are specific topics you want to hear about or you wish to give feedback, feel free to send me a message or leave a comment!

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Coffee with the Council**: By ordinance, Schaumburg does not allow speed bumps due to snow plowing and emergency vehicles not allowing them.

New US Bank being constructed on Higgins/Meacham on the parking lot of target. Great use of unused parking spaces. Apparently, the bank experienced robberies a few years back and this new location could be more secure for them.

**Transportation Committee**: Meacham Road bridge replacement began late last month.

On July 31, the police department traffic unit focused on e-device enforcement, issuing 16 citations and 20 warning citations to 28 individuals under 16, 3 under 8, and five to adults.

**Engineering and Public Works**: Weathersfield Way (from Barrington Rd to Springinsguth Rd) to get resurfaced and an off-street multi-use path will be constructed alongside it. Construction time to be determined.

**Sister Cities Commission**: Consideration being given for portion of their funds to be used as scholarships for individuals studying German or Japanese. May partner with Harper College and Dooley Elementary.

**Braintree Drive Improvement:** A public meeting was made available to discuss future improvement for Braintree Dr. Consideration being given to move bike lanes to off-street path, but to then maintain the current two-lane road with on-street parking on the side.

Intersection of Braintree/Weathersfield to be converted into a roundabout.

**Public Safety:** Following a “Coffee with the Council” meeting last year where residents complained of other residents lighting fireworks during July 4^(th), the Police Department sent letters to anyone who received citations in the last three years, hand delivered letters to all HOAs and Apartment Complexes. They also increased public education to get the word out. This year was the lowest number of fireworks calls.

*Personal thought*: the fact the Chief and his department went to this extent following a couple complaints from a few residents out of the 78,000 who live in our village speaks volumes about: one, in Schaumburg, if you make a complaint, leadership cares and you can see change happen. Two, our police department also cares about their residents and will go great lengths to assist them.

**New Businesses**:

·       The Secret Kitchen will be located on 1411 W Schaumburg Rd at the Schaumburg Plaza. This business already exists in India and Canada, but this would be the first location in the US. It is Indian food fused with modern techniques and will serve both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food.

·       Caseys to replace Mobil on Plum Grove and Schaumburg. Mobil gas station will be demolished and the new Caseys will replace and improve any remaining and existing infrastructure. A kitchen will be added and there may be seating. Otherwise, it is still designed to be a grab-and-go, for gas and food.

·       New tattoo parlor to open on Roselle and Weathersfield at the Weathersway Plaza. This would be the fifth tattoo parlor to be approved in Schaumburg.

·       New ice cream shop, Bruster’s Real Ice Cream, to be built and open on empty lot of corner on Irving Park Road/Mercury Dr. It will be fresh ice cream made on site daily via a walk-up patio or drive through. No indoor seating will be available aside for restroom access.

**Schaumburg Incorporating More Land**: A chunk of land near the Metra Station, Irving Park/Wise Rds, and Long Ave is to be incorporated into Schaumburg and redeveloped into a commercial and industrial employment district.",4,1759343294.0,schaumburg,1,1.0,False

Somewhere on Highway 26.

“Course, I didn’t even see him come up on me, too busy trying to put my tent together, I just heard my brother shout ‘Howard! Turn around!’ and sure enough when I turned there was the biggest alligator I ever seen with my ankle between his teeth and I pulled that leg out just before he went snap! The teeth caught the sole of my shoe and ripped it right off my foot!” Howard laughed, wiping a tear from his eye. 

I was laughing too.

“What did you do next?” 

Howard looked at me and shook his head. “You wouldn’t even believe it…” 

“I would!” I insisted, eager to hear how his story ended.

Howard’s eyes lifted from the road as if to look up and retrieve the memory from the stars. 
“I lept over my tent, just stood there frozen staring at this monster and he is staring at me, and I tell you this alligator laughed.”

“Laughed? Alligators can’t laugh!” I refuted. 

“This one did.” Howard assured me, “Ha-Ha-Ha, like that…. Then it just backed into the water again, disappeared completely, not a bubble. I said to my brother, “Get me the hell out of here, that damn gator can keep the shoe!”

A green sign materialized out from the darkness. 

Taghorn: 20 Miles
Garden Rock: 80 Miles
Lakesville: 170 Miles.

Howard checked his watch and yawned. 
“Good diner up in Taghorn, you like eggs?” He asked.

I shrugged, “Yeah I guess.” 

“I could do with some coffee.” 

I looked out to a passing country shrouded in darkness to reveal nothing of where we could be. A ghostly reflection of myself stared back through the window and I could see Howard staring behind me. I looked at him, and his eyes were on the road again. 

“Are you from Eastpoint?” I asked him. 

“Who me? Yeah, could say I am.” He answered. 

“But you were going to Lakesville?” 

“That’s correct. I’m in between at the moment. Got some family up there I’m gonna stay with over the weekend. It’s my brother’s birthday actually.” 

“I feel like I’ve seen you before.” I said to him, something familiar about this person driving like a puzzle piece that fit somewhere in memory. Talkative Howard paused, he heard me but did not answer straight away, he glanced at the rearview mirror and cleared his throat. 

“It’s possible.” He muttered. “It’s a small town.” 

“I’m worried that my parents tried to pick me up, or that I was wrong about this whole thing.” I admitted. 

Howard was letting another car overtake him. 
“Oh, I wouldn’t worry about it. I’m sure that was their initial plan, but stuff does happen. Hell, my folks left me in some places.” He chuckled. 

In the distance I could see glowing dots appearing down the hill. A small town. Taghorn. 

When we pulled into the dirt parking lot, the neon sign of the diner was like a stellar beacon on a dark planet, as if trucks bound for the Las Vegas strip had it fall from their cargo and here it stayed, repurposed. There were a few cars already parked, the car that passed us was getting gas at the station further down. In the window of the diner some lone travelers held cutlery to pancakes and from their coffee cup’s steam rose to form apparitions of ghostly company in their solitary booths. An old man sat hands clasped to his chin, pondering the limited future and thanked a waitress with a nod.

I unbuckled my seatbelt, but Howard stopped me.
“Wait in the car, little miss, I’ll bring you back some eggs.” 

He opened the door and left for the diner, leaving me with the rhythmic vibrations of the idling engine. As he walked hands hidden in his jacket pockets, a couple stopped him. 

They seemed to recognize him as smiles formed on their faces, and they were quick to shake hands. They stood talking. Howard pointed back at his car with me inside and the couple turned to look and waved at me. I waved back. Howard said a last goodbye to them as he opened the diner’s door. The couple got inside a truck and then their taillights passed into the night as another thing devoured. 

Howard disappeared into the diner and I sat waiting. Boredom turned into curiosity, so I looked behind at the back seat. There was a canvas gym bag, a black pen, a stained baseball cap and the crumpled leftovers of a drive-thru dinner and receipts. I turned the dial of the radio and a roar of static came through, but also a man’s voice:

‘(Inaudible)’s Estate has urged the thief to come forward and return the remains of (Inaudible) to the (Inaudible) Memorial Gardens in Hollywood.’ 

I turned the radio off again, the signal was still awful. 

I looked at the dashboard behind the steering wheel and saw a gas tank over half full and a picture of a woman, a crease ran through her face like the image was mostly kept folded. I studied the black scuff marks on the glove compartment in front of me, struck into plastic like the scratched tallies of a jailcell calendar. I looked at the footwells, and that’s when I saw a piece of pink fabric wedged beneath his seat. 

Curious, I leant over and pinched the cloth between my fingers and pulled it free where it un-scrunched and fell into its shape, where to my horror, I saw it was a pair of my missing underwear. 

I wanted to be wrong, that they were not mine. I had not seen that pair for over a week and hoped by some strange, concerning coincidence, I had found ones that were the exact pattern and size that I had blamed the other orphaned girls for stealing. 
At that age, my gut feeling knew more than I did, and I should have listened to it. If I could go back, I would have run from that car. I would have gone to someone. I would have done differently. I wouldn’t have run away from Eastpoint. 

I shoved the underwear back under his seat. How would I have brought that up? Was that a conversation I was willing to have at that time and place? It wasn’t. Before I could think of what to do, I looked up to see Howard walking back to the car. He carried two Styrofoam containers that steamed like rail locomotives on route. 

He opened the door and hurried inside to escape from the biting chill and turned up the heat and held his hands to the vents to warm them. He passed me my scrambled eggs where a plastic fork was stabbed upright. Howard shoveled his food into his mouth and sipped his coffee. We sat in silence only to eat and watch people go about their nocturnal doings until he wiped his hands and said “Alrighty” before he flicked his headlights on and took the park brake off. Then we were on the road again. 

He checked his watch; whatever time it read raised no concern. I thought about asking him why he had my- or any girls’ underwear in his car. But I didn’t want to invite whatever might have followed, being out there on the road in the middle of nowhere, the discomfort of the question was more bearable than the discomfort of the answer.

“Who’s that in the picture?” I asked, pointing at the photograph taped on the dashboard. He lifted his thumbs from the wheel to look. 

“That’s uh…That’s just the most beautiful creature to ever live.” He declared.

“Oh. That your wife?” 
Howard tilted his head to the side as if my guess was somewhat correct. 

“Eh, something like that…You ever watch old movies? The black and white ones?” 

I shook my head. 

“Okay well. She used to star in them. She was an actress.” 

“Oh…cool. How did you meet?” I asked.

“Well…I always was her biggest fan. She signed a poster for me once, didn’t say anything but drew a little love heart on it too. I knew then she liked me.” 

“You knew she liked you?” 

“Uh huh. No doubt about it. Her last movie ever, there’s this scene where she is looking out the window, and someone opens the door. She stares straight at the camera and says ‘I remember you. Even though years have gone by, how could I forget such love?” Man…when I saw that I just couldn’t believe it. I knew she was talking to me.” Howard reminisced with a lover’s smile. 

I didn’t really know what to say after that. Even though I was young teenager, I knew there was something not quite right about how Howard saw the world. I stared out of the window, hoping something would appear worth talking about, but the silence was too uncomfortable, it made me nervous.

“She uh…You said her last movie? She doesn’t act anymore?”

Howard nodded. “Yeah…there was a…what do you call it…an accident I’d say…You know, you do have her eyes. That’s good.” He said.

I forced a smile, but I didn’t mean it.

“Something wrong?” Howard asked me. 
I hated that he said that. It was like he knew I didn’t believe him and wanted to know what I had to say about it. 

“Um. Well. I just saw that you had girls’ underwear under your seat, just right there.” I admitted as I pointed to them. 

Howard screwed his face up as he lifted his arms and legs to look around the bottom of his car seat. Keeping his eyes on the road, he took his hand and patted the general area until he finally felt what I was talking about. He pulled the underwear free and laid them on his lap. 

“Oh!” He recoiled, before tossing them into the back seat. 

“Listen, I’m borrowing this car from a friend of mine. I’m fixing it for her. She had her whole wardrobe in this thing. Thought I took all her clothes out.” 

Howard laughed and wiped his hands on his pants.
I chuckled. I did; I guess it made enough sense. Maybe I felt relieved, maybe I didn’t. But I just wanted to get to Lakesville. 

“So you’re a mechanic?” I asked him.

“No. I work in sanitation and waste management.” 
He said, and that’s when I knew I had seen him before. 

“Wait a minute. You’re the janitor at-

“At Eastpoint’s Group Home for Girls, yep. You know something… I picked you for a runaway the moment I saw you.” He said.

“On the highway?”

“At your school desk.” He interrupted. “Don’t worry! I ain’t gonna snitch. I helped them other two girls.”
“You helped Beth and Janey? Where did they go?” I wondered. 

Howard stared at the road; he took a moment to answer.

“I can’t tell you that.”

“They were my friends.” I said to him.

“Then I’m sorry.” He replied.

Howard checked his watch again and cleared his throat but did not say anything else. A sign that said Gardner: 10 Miles appeared from the dark, and Howard checked his watch once more. We passed some roadside crosses, shrines made for the unlucky who crashed on these roads, new flowers told of still grieving families.

“It’s just that…I told them girls I wouldn’t tell no one. They wanted to disappear, had this whole thing planned.” He confessed. 

“Okay…” I muttered. 

Howard turned onto another road, then came to stop behind a timber truck hauling white Aspin logs. He followed that truck until he merged onto another main road. After a while another sign flew past us. 

‘Camden: 5 Miles
Eden Springs: 20 Miles
Scorville: 100 Miles.’

When the detectives asked me how I knew he was going the wrong way, how I knew we were no longer heading to Lakesville the normal route, I told them that I remebered that sign. That apparently helped a lot in finding the gate. I didn’t ask Howard about it at the time and looking back, it wouldn’t have done anything anyway. There seemed to be more traffic on that road, and I began to realize the gravity of what I had done. When morning comes, all the teachers and social workers will be in a frenzy, the police will get called. I started to feel the twisting knot of guilt in my stomach.

“If Miss Fortescue finds me… I’m going to be in a lot of trouble. I’m already in a lot of trouble, aren’t I?” I spoke.

Howard stared ahead, “Eh, I wouldn’t worry about it.” 

Then he turned on his indicator and slowed down. At first, I thought there was something wrong with the car, maybe he realized he made a wrong turn. But he veered off the road and carefully drove in the ditch until a tiny clearing appeared in the woods, nothing more than a break in the tree line. The car bounced and shook side to side as we drove over uneven ground, and Howard pulled the wheel and turned onto on a dirt road seen only in the headlights. 

“Where are you going?”  I argued as we disappeared into the woods.

He looked at the rearview mirror “My wife lives this way. Were gonna ask her about your parents, try to getchya home.”

1nvg3lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1nvg3lg/cpmscacs_high_conversions_flat/,"CPMs/CACs High, Conversions Flat?","I’m in over a dozen different META accounts for various direct marketing companies, as well as my own offers and freelancing biz. Lots of algo changes across the board, which really shouldn’t surprise anyone with politics and shakeup happening over TikTok America. (META has been reacting to TikTok for years now, which is why it’s so much more of an event-based algo.)

But a problem I see even top spenders running into comes down to a TAM problem. 

Problem 1) A small TAM never gives your creative a true test, because META’s algo isn’t sure who you help, and 2 more people exactly like them. And without getting enough CAPI events (both common and custom events,) your TAM stagnates, which literally can’t give you positive, scalable results. 

Problem 2) You’re not getting categorized in the right vertical(s), so your TAM doesn’t really have the chance to get defined and expanded in the first place. This is a Positioning Point problem. For instance, if you’re running a dopamine nootropic on the front end, you need clear verticals: ADHD, Coffee Alternative For Energy, Dopamine Burnout (due to social media.) 

Problem 3) When you’re responding to data to optimize copy, you have to know what elements are IN your copy to know exactly what to optimize and why. Most copywriters couldn’t tell you the elements that get past the first 5 seconds (like Hidden Enemy, Deeper Core, Mechanism), so they really have no clue what they’re optimizing or rewriting. Which means, the creative is just random spaghetti thrown against the wall to see what sticks, instead of truly responding to data.

Problem 4) No engagement = no events. Since META is event based, like getting prospects to watch 5, 10, and 15 seconds of your VSL are what hyper-train TAM. No comments, no dog whistle language that vertical is known for, no suspension of disbelief. I wholeheartedly recommend running engagement ads, with a decent spend, to get more engagement going in your account. These need to be tested just like you would conversion ads - in terms of shutting down ones that aren’t showing signs of performing, while constantly throwing up new ones to see how they do. (When you do get comments, respond with your offer. Engagement posts that do well can also perform well as conversion ads - using the same post ID.)

Problem 5) If you’re running video in your ads, the first line is everything. It needs to hit your positioning hard.

Not only does this help ramp up conversions again, but it typically brings CPMs/CAC down, while making the click infinitely more relevant. 

Tip: Run 1-10 Assessments. They’re massive dopamine triggers, and help get loads of CAPI events you can train TAM with.",1,1759342913.0,FacebookAds,0,1.0,False

In summary 
Got too the prem from none league barely 
Will go into the pre-season with a championship team best players are 

ST CA decent prem player PA good premiership player 

ST CA decent prem player PA close too full (was once a wonderkid)

Everyone else CA is leading championship or less some have potential to be decent/good prem players.

First the backstory with FM so cheap because it’s been out so long I thought I’d pick it up for the first time since FM14 with the idea of a journeyman 

This is a long read I apologise 

Started unemployed 0 badges Sunday league experience  

23/24 season got offered the Maidstone job a full time club under performing in the conference south, saved them from the drop but only 11th 

24/25 2nd in the league but promoted via the play-offs 🎉

25/26 13th in the national league earned me manager of the year but I was hoping for better. 

2026/2027 with us 18th in the league I was summoned into the boardroom for a, why are you doing so bad talk 

We were 10th in the EXG table and playing Kidderminster next who were 24th in the league. I said don’t worry we will in the next game! 

A EXG of 4.2 too 0.7 we draw 2-2 and I’m sacked. 🧳

Took my time waiting to be offered the right job. 

27/28 Walsal 23rd in the drop zone of league 2 offered me the job I took it! I’m in the football league finally! Somehow! 

I kept them up in 16th but this is where the fun starts 

See the club I support Grimsby town where relegated too none league, sacked there manager so I had to go for the job. 

They offered it me and I’m back in none league dammit!  

28/29 national league champions 

Confession time they told me I had to go up and through fear of the sack I plug and played the FM24 World Cup tactics so I could focus on the team building. 

29/30 7th placed finish 

30/31 2nd with 100 points 💀 but promoted top league one 🎉

31/32 back too back promotions into the championship 

32/33

Its at this point I decide I’m going solo no more plug and play back too making my own if I’m going to stay up I want to do it and be “proud”

I went with a 5212 with complete wingbacks it “worked” a 14th place finish 

33/34 11th but I was finally getting some transfer funds 4 mil that I could do the “installments” and make it into more. 

34/35 6th I am in the play-offs 
After just about getting through too the final on pens v 3rd placed Brentford I had Burnley the most out of form team going into the play-offs 

The final 
10 minutes in my striker is sent off straight red we lose 4-0. 

36/37 the madness 

By this point I’m fully in on my 5-2-1-2 I’ve bought players for the roles all the wingers are gone I’ve got 6 CBs I have a steady team my first wonder kid up top what could go wrong……. From September I did’t win for 16 games 16!

When I finally win it was a 86th minute leveller followed by a 93rd minute winner from Facundo Canterod my “wonderkid”

Don’t ask me how I did’t get the sack I was rage running through the game I was changing everything I was going to quit the save at some point. 

Somehow I had the leagues second best defence but worst attack 

Time too study 👨‍🎓👨‍🎓 

I watched save your daves 
Tips Tricks 
How to build a tactic
You name it I did it.

What I discovered was my fullbacks where twice as crap as last year see my RWB was on loan and my LWB was taken for his 5 mil release clause (he had been with me for 4 seasons) 

I dropped my CAM into a CM to AP to give me for in midfield but still a CAM like presence in the box. 

Luckily January was round the corner 
And by the grace of god Hesca paid me 8 mil for Luis Quintero who was meant to be my CAM and Cardiff gave me 2.4 mil for Emre Trezgel 

With this Money I night in the LW I had on loan last season for (7 mil) 

A player Evo can play LWB and RWB for 1.1 mil 

I loan a play from Porto I had two seasons ago was contract was up in 6 months 

I spent 3.6 mil on another player who could play LWB/RWB

And my director of football foung me a striker from a prem team who could play both AF and DLF well who was a “decent premiership player” 

From the 1/1/2036
We went W15 D2 L6

Finishing 6th only because Shrewsbury draw there last game (they won none of there final 5 games)
