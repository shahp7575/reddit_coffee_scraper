1m4f4b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZigBee/comments/1m4f4b4/odd_issue_with_sonof_pro_running_z2t_tasmota/,Odd issue with Sonof Pro running Z2T (Tasmota),"I have an older style Sonof Pro bridge that for several years has run as a local controller for a remote summer cabin.  It's perfect for the job, because it can run on a minimal current, and tack on to a nearby Wifi signal to relay data back to an MQTT server at home.  Local rules let me have a scene switch control most of the relays/lights locally, while sensors can log their data with the main system at home most times.

After literally years of working, this past week it did something odd.  It rebooted, spontaneously, and the zigbee radio *refused to start*, saying **""timeout, goto label 99""**.  I was running an older firmware (13.2) and ZNF firmware (2022 based), and nothing in the network has changed in months.

After multiple googles and frustration, I decided maybe updating to current (15.1) may help.  That did change the error I got, to **""Failed to start in coordinator mode, try changing PanID.""**  This was confusing, because there are no other potential coordinators anywhere near here.  No new devices, nothing. Just a failing coordinator.  But on 15.1, the error was very fast. Not a 10 second delay like 13.2 had done.

After trying several things (including flashing the ZNF firmware again), and nothing working, I decided to bite the bullet and do a full reset/reflash, which got the device working again. After a hard reset (40s hold), it rebooted, it came right up, and was fine. I connected it to wifi via the AP, and went to reload a config save I had from a couple months before. On reboot, it instantly failed again.  But I did note it changed the PanID back to the original number (which it had randomized during reset).  
  
I decided at this point to try to set a new PanID (this time via ZbConfig), which again wiped the tables and rebooted, and it started right up.  Change it back, instant failure.  So I changed it to something working, and figured this was just my fate, and started the process of re-pairing.  
  
I started with a socket module that was close to me.  Went into pairing mode, long held the button on the device, and it paired up. My MQTT setup relies on renaming the devices (like P-CoffeeMaker), as short-IDs can be unreliable, so I started the console command to rename it (ZbName).  On entering the short-ID the browser auto-complete had the proper name.  I was the same short-ID as the prior network!  As I paused to think about this, the join timed out, and a few moments later 3 more devices self-joined!  Mind you, the Pro was no longer in pairing mode, but these devices still self-joined, all with their old short-ID numbers.  This along with autocomplete made renaming trivial.  In the end I only had to manually re-pair 3 of 14 devices, while the rest self-added.

So I'm left with a couple questions:

1. Why did the controller suddenly not work on a PanID that it had been using for years?
2. Why after a change out and back did it still fail on just that PanID?
3. How did the devices self-join when not in pairing mode, after a PanID change?

To be clear, I'm not complaining too loudly, since once I figured out what to do, and fixing it took far less time than I expected it would once it was up and running again.  But I'm still confused as to how it got into this bad state to start with.",1,1752982799.0,ZigBee,0,1.0,False

We haven't tried turning it back on yet and I have the PC drying in front of a fan. The PSU however had coffee from the top running out the bottom so I'm assuming it's completely done for. 

Could I simply plug the parts i.e graphics card, ram, etc, into my pc to test if they're okay or will that put my pc at risk aswell? If so, is there a way to test them without putting good parts at risk?

My hands trembled slightly around the coffee tray, but I held onto it like my life depended on it.

Luca Steele stood at the head of the long glass table, tall, lethal, and entirely too composed for a man who’d just been drenched in a splash of boiling cappuccino. Steam still rose from his tailored black suit, but his steel-gray eyes were colder than ice.

“You’ve worked for me for two years,” he said, each word slow, deliberate, laced with venom. “And you still manage to be a walking disaster. Fix it. Or quit.”

No one dared to breathe.

The coffee stain spread across the crisp white papers in front of him, slowly bleeding into confidential numbers and contract drafts worth millions. I scrambled forward, grabbing tissues from the tray, muttering apologies that sounded too small, too broken, too pathetic.

“I’m sorry, Mr. Steele—”

“Sorry doesn’t clean Armani.” He stepped back, brushing off his sleeve with visible disgust. “And what the *hell* are you wearing?”

I froze.

His eyes dragged over me. Every inch.

My oversized brown cardigan hung off my shoulders like a borrowed curtain. The faded blouse underneath clung to me awkwardly, a button missing near the collar. The olive-green skirt was too long, too wrinkled, and paired horribly with the scuffed, worn-out flats I’d owned since college.

My foundation was two shades too pale. My lipstick was crooked. The jet-black wig I wore hung limply around my face, uncombed and clearly fake. And the massive round sunglasses I wore indoors? That was the final punchline.

I was a caricature. And everyone knew it.

Chuckles rippled softly across the room.

“I’m not running a charity,” Luca said, cutting through the silence. “If you can’t show up looking like a professional, then don’t show up at all.”

He didn’t wait for a response. He turned his back and walked toward the screen, launching into a presentation like I hadn’t just been stripped of every ounce of dignity in front of ten high-ranking executives.

I stood there, cheeks burning, throat tight.

And then I turned and walked out.

The moment the bathroom door clicked shut behind me, I collapsed into the farthest stall. My hands gripped the toilet seat as sobs wracked my chest. Quiet, sharp, hopeless sobs.

I didn’t even care about the coffee anymore. Or the cardigan. Or the snickers in the room.

I was just so… *tired*.

Tired of hiding. Tired of pretending. Tired of working ten times harder just to be invisible.

I reached into my purse for tissues and caught my reflection in the mirror through the gap in the stall door.

*God. I did look awful.*

The glasses had fogged up from my breath. My mascara was smudged beneath the frames. And the wig—it sat like a lifeless animal on my head, tangled, greasy, and suffocating. I buried my face into my hands, trying to breathe.

Then—my phone buzzed.

*LUCA STEELE.*

I swallowed hard.

I wiped my face with toilet paper, fixed my lipstick with shaking fingers, tucked a strand of wig behind my ear, and inhaled once. Twice.

By the time I stepped out of the stall, the tears were gone.

*The mask was back.*

I walked through the hallway, the same hallway I walked every day, except now it felt like a spotlight was burning holes in me. Two interns passed by, whispering a little too loudly.

“*She looks like a blind clown.”*

*“I heard she lives in her car*.”

“*She probably has blackmail on him. No way Steele keeps that thing around otherwise.”*

I didn’t flinch. I didn’t break stride. I never did.

Luca’s office loomed ahead, the frosted glass doors tall and foreboding. I stepped in without knocking.

He didn’t look up.

His office was cold, like everything else about him—monochrome, sharp lines, minimal furniture. But he was the only part of the room that radiated heat. Not warmth—heat. Intensity.

Luca Steele, age twenty-nine, CEO of one of the most ruthless corporate empires in the world. Jet-black tousled hair. Perfectly sculpted jawline. That expensive three-day stubble that looked like it belonged on a magazine cover. And those eyes—ice-colored and emotionless.They’d never softened. Not once.

I handed him the corrected reports in silence.

He barely acknowledged me.

“Get me Victoria Ames on the line. And fix the deck from slide 8 onward. It’s sloppy.”

“Yes, Mr. Steele.”

I turned, heading for the door. My phone rang. I paused, glanced at the screen. *Unknown Number.*

“Hello?” I whispered.

A soft voice crackled on the line. “Hi, this is Carla from the reception desk. There’s… um… there’s a man here to see you.”

My stomach tightened. “A man?” I said, confused. “Who?”

She hesitated. “He gave his name. Said you’d recognize it.”

I waited.

“Jonathan Kingsley.”

When comparing green tea vs black tea caffeine, it’s clear that black tea generally contains more caffeine:

||
||
|Tea Type|Caffeine per 8 oz (240ml)|
|Green Tea|20–45 mg|
|Black Tea|40–70 mg|

If you're looking for a mild caffeine boost without the jitters, green tea is ideal. Black tea, however, is perfect for those who want a stronger energy lift, especially as a morning alternative to coffee.

# Antioxidants

* Green tea is rich in catechins, especially EGCG, known for powerful antioxidant effects
* Black tea contains theaflavins and thearubigins, which support heart health and digestion

>

# Taste & Pairings

||
||
|Tea Type|Flavor Profile|Common Pairings|
|Black Tea|Strong, bold, full-bodied|Milk, lemon, sugar|
|Green Tea|Light, vegetal, sometimes grassy|Usually served plain or with lemon|

# Processing

Green tea is steamed or pan-fired to stop oxidation, while black tea is fully oxidized, resulting in a richer flavor and darker color.

# Weight Loss Support

Green tea- helps burn fat and boost metabolism, thanks to high levels of EGCG.

Black tea- may reduce fat absorption and support digestion, with its theaflavins.

Both can aid in weight management when paired with a healthy diet.

1m4eyvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1m4eyvk/the_fighting_tops_chapter_one/,The Fighting Tops: Chapter One,"During the North American War of 1812, over 10,000 slaves escaped to the safety of British lines. 

4,000 enlisted as paid soldiers and sailors in His Majesty’s service. 

Of these, 200 were selected to join the elite corps of Royal Marines…

CHAPTER 1 

*South Atlantic, 1814* 

It was from Captain Low that I learned the secret to life. The single most important rule, he’d told me, the rule that had kept his head above water these many years in His Majesty’s service: Be a good marine. 

“It’s the most natural of instincts,” he said. “Because the King created the Royal Marines, and we are the King’s subjects.” He stalked back and forth as he spoke, ducking the crossbeams overhead, then paused and swung his piercing eyes on me. “Why are you a marine, Corporal Gideon?” 

Staring as straight and blankly as I could, willing my eyes to see not just into but through the bulkhead to the expanse of sea beyond it, I considered mentioning the ruthless plantation in Georgia, and my enlistment in British service as a means of freedom from American slavery. I could mention Abigail, and what my master did to her the day before I escaped. 

But with Private Teale – another freed slave diversifying HMS *Commerce*’s otherwise white complement of marines – at attention beside me, and the cynical black ship’s surgeon within earshot through the wardroom door, Captain Low was in no mood for a lecture on African Diaspora. 

“Because the King made me one, sir.” I spoke strongly enough, but my words lacked conviction, and the captain glared, while the doctor’s facetious cough carried through the door.

“A marine,” said Low, unphased and carrying on with his uniform inspection, the frequent ducking of his lanky frame, while keeping his severe but not unkind expression fixed on me, “always knows what is required by asking himself: What would a *good marine* do, right now, in this circumstance? In all circumstance?”

Inspecting Private Teale, Low’s own instincts proved themselves with the immediate discovery of missing pipeclay on the back of his crossbelt, and he dismissed Teale without a word. Still addressing me he said, “I understand you began your service with Lord Cochrane’s outfit on Tangier. And that he personally raised you to corporal at the Chesapeake.” 

“Aye, sir.” 

“Thomas Cochrane is a particular friend of mine. He built a reputation training good fighting marines. Could be he saw something in you…but even decorated war heroes make mistakes.” 

Six bells rang on the quarterdeck. All hands called aft; the bosun’s pipe shrilled out and above our heads came the sound of many running bare feet. But I stayed rooted in place, unable to move while Captain Low held me in an awkward silence, an awkwardness he seemed to enjoy, even encourage with his marginally perplexed eyebrows.

Finally, he said, “What say you move along to your fucking post, Corporal?” 

“Aye, sir,” I said, saluting with relief, slinging my musket and hurtling up the ladder through the hatch and onto the main deck of the Commerce. 

The sunset blazed crimson, the sea turning a curious wine-color in response, and silhouetted on the western swells the reason for our hastily assembled uniform inspection was coming across on a barge from the flag ship, the *Achilles*: Rear Admiral John Warren. I joined my fellow marines at the rail, Teale among them in a double-clayed crossbelt, fiddling with his gloves. 

When the Admiral came aboard we were in our places, a line of splendid scarlet coats, ramrod straight, and we presented arms with a rhythmic stamp and clash that would have rivaled the much larger contingent of marines aboard the flagship. 

Captain Low’s stoic expression cracked for the briefest of moments; it was clear he found our presentation of drill extremely satisfying, and he knew the flagship’s marine officer heard our thunder even across 500 yards of chopping sea. Colonel Woolcomb would now be extolling his ship’s marines to wipe the *Commerce*’s eye with their own deafening boot and musket strike upon the Admiral’s return.

But before Low could resume his stoic expression, and before we’d finished inwardly congratulating ourselves, the proud gleam in his eyes took on a smoke- tinged fury. Teale’s massive black thumb was sticking out from a tear in the white glove holding his musket.

With the sun at our backs this egregious breach of centuries-long Naval custom was hardly visible to the quarterdeck, much less so as Captain Chevers and the Navy officers were wholly taken up with ushering the Admiral into the dining cabin for toasted cheese and Madeira, or beefsteak if that didn’t suit, or perhaps his Lordship preferred the lighter dish of pan-buttered anchovies—but a tremble passed through our rank, and nearby seamen in their much looser formations nudged each other and grinned, plainly enjoying our terror. 

For every foremast jack aboard felt the shadow cast by Captain Low’s infinite incredulity; he stared aghast at the thumb as if a torn glove was some new terror the marines had never encountered in their illustrious history. 

I silently willed Teale to keep his gaze like mine, expressionless and farsighted on the line of purple horizon, unthinking and deaf to all but lawful orders, like a good marine. 

At dinner that evening, a splendid dinner in which the leftover anchovies and half-filled Madeira bottles were shared out, the consensus of the lower deck hands was that Private Teale would certainly be court-martialed and executed by the next turn of the glass. 

Ronald West, Carpenters Mate, had it from a midshipman who overheard Captain Low assert that the issue was no longer whether to execute Private Teale, but whether he was to be hung by the bowsprit or the topgallant crosstrees. At the same juncture Barrett Harding, focs’l hand, had it from the gunner that the wardroom was discussing the number of prescribed lashes, not in tens or hundreds but thousands. 

“Never seen a man bear up to a thousand on the grating,” said Harding, with a grave shake of his head. The younger ship’s boys stared in open-mouthed horror at his words. “A hundred, sure. I took 4 dozen on the Tulon blockade and none the worse. But this here flogging tomorrow? His blood will right pour out the scuppers!” 

But the Admiral’s orders left little time for punishment, real or imagined, to take place aboard the *Commerce*: Captain Chevers was to proceed with his ship, sailors, and marines to Cape Hatteras, making all possible haste to destroy an American shore battery and two gunboats commanding the southern inlet to the sound.  

For five hundred miles we drilled with our small boats, a sweet-sailing cutter and the smaller launch, twenty sailors in the one and twelve marines in the other, rowing round and round the *Commerce* as she sailed north under a steady topsail breeze. 

“Be a good marine.”

Launch and row. Hook on and raise up. Heave hearty now, look alive! 

Be a good marine. 

Dryfire musket from the topmast 100 times. Captain Low says we lose a yard of accuracy for every degree of northern latitude gained, though the surgeon denies this empirically and is happy to show you the figures. 

Be a good marine. 

Eat and sleep. Ship’s biscuit and salt beef, dried peas and two pints grog. Strike the bell and turn the glass. Pipe-clay and polish, lay out britches and waistcoat in passing rains to wash out salt stains. Black-brush top hat and boots. 

Be a good marine. 

Raise and Lower boats again. This time we pull in the *Commerce’*s wake, Major Low on the taffrail, gold watch in hand while we gasp and strain at our oars. By now both launch and the cutter had their picked crews, and those sailors left to idle on deck during our exercises developed something of a chip on their shoulder, which only nurtured our sense of elitism. It wasn’t long before we began ribbing them with cries of, “See to my oar there, Mate!” and requests to send letters to loved ones in the event of our glorious deaths.  

This disparity ended when a calm sea, the first such calm since our ship parted Admiral Warren’s squadron, allowed the others to work up the sloop’s 14 4-pounder cannons, for it was they who would take on the American gunboats while we stormed the battery. 

At quarters each evening they blazed steadily away, sometimes from both sides of the ship at once, running the light guns in and out on their tackle, firing, sponging and reloading in teams. 

Teale and I often watched from the topmast, some eighty feet above the roaring din on deck. From this rolling vantage the scene was spectacular: the ship hidden by a carpet of smoke flickering with orange stabs of cannon fire, and the plumes of white water in the distance where the round shot struck. 

All hands were therefore in a state of happy exhaustion when, to a brilliant sunrise breaking over flat seas, the *Commerce* raised the distant fleck of St Augustine on her larboard bow. From here it was only 3-days sail to Cape Hatteras, but our stores were dangerously low, and Captain Chevers was not of mind to take his sloop into battle without we had plenty of fresh water for all hands. 

I was unloading the boats, clearing our stored weapons, stripping the footpads and making space to ferry our new casks aboard, when a breathless midshipman came running down the gangway. “Captain Chevers’ compliments to the Corporal, and would it please you to come to his cabin this very moment?” 

In three minutes’ time I was in my best scarlet coat, tight gators and black neckstock, sidearm and buttons gleaming, at the door of the Captain’s Cabin. His steward appeared to show me inside, grunting approval at the perfect military splendor of my uniform.

“And don’t address the Captain without he speaks to you first,” he said, a fully dispensable statement. 

The door opened, and for a moment I was blinded by the evening glare in the cabin’s magnificent stern windows. 

The captain was in conference with his officers and Captain Low, whose red jacket stood out among the others’ gold-laced blue. There was also a gentleman I didn’t know, a visitor from the town with a prodigious grey beard. Despite his age and missing left eye he was powerfully built and well-dressed, with the queen’s Order of Bath shining on his coat. 

Musing navigational charts, their discussion carried on for some moments while I stood at strict attention, a deaf and mute sentry to whom eavesdropping constituted breach of duty.

It appeared the old gentleman had news of a Dutch privateer, a heavy frigate out of Valparaiso, laden with gold to persuade native Creek warriors to the American side. The gentleman intended to ambush this shipment on its subsequent journey overland, where it would be most vulnerable, and redirect the gold to our Seminole allies. He knew one of our marines had escaped a plantation in Indian country, and he would be most grateful for a scout who knew the territory. 

At the word scout all eyes turned on me, and he said, “Is this your man?” Stepping around the desk he offered me a calloused hand. “Stand easy, Corporal.” 

Major Low offered a quick glance, a permissive tilt of the head none but I could have noticed. 

I saluted and removed my hat, taking the old man’s hand and returning its full pressure, no small feat. 

“Sir Edward Nicolls,” he said. “At your service.” 

I recognized the name at once. Back on Tangier Island, my drill instructors spoke of Major-General Nicolls in reverent tones, that most famous of royal marine officers whose long and bloodied career had been elevated to legend throughout the fleet. 

Even the ship’s surgeon, an outspoken critic of the British military as exploiters of destitute, able-bodied youths fleeing slavery, grudgingly estimated that Sir Nicolls’ political efforts as an abolitionist led to thousands of former slaves being granted asylum on British soil. Protected by the laws of His Majesty, they could no longer be arrested and returned as rightful property.  

Indeed, it was this horrifying possibility that was to blame for my current summons. As a marine I’d been frequently shuffled from one ship’s company to another, or detached with the army for inshore work, but never had I been consulted on the order, much less given the option to refuse. 

“It seems there’s some additional risk,” said Captain Chevers, “Beyond the military risk, that is, for you *personally* . . . a known fugitive in Georgia. If captured it’s likely you’d not be viewed as a prisoner of war, entitled to certain rights and so forth, but as a freedom-seeker and vagabond. A wanted criminal.”  

“Captain Low here insisted you’d be delighted to volunteer,” said Sir Nicolls with a wry look, “But I must hear it from you.” 

I hadn’t thought of the miserable old plantation for weeks, maybe longer. Being a good marine had taken my full measure of attention. But now in a flash my mind raced back along childhood paths, through tangled processions of forest, plantation, and marsh, seemingly endless until they plunged into the wide Oconee River, and beyond that, the truly wild country. 

Then came the predictable memories of Abigail, the house slave born to the plantation the same year as I, cicadas howling as we explored every creek and game trail, and how later as lovers absconded to many a pre-discovered hideout familiar to us alone. 

It occurred to me they were waiting on my answer. Sir Nicolls had filled the interim of my reverie with remarks that there was no pressing danger of such capture, particularly as he had a regiment of highlanders on station, all right forward hands with a bayonet, and that I stood to receive 25 pounds sterling for services rendered. But soon he could stall no longer.

“Well then, what do you say, Corporal?”

I said: “If you please, sir . . . the corporal would be most grateful.” 

Sir Nicolls beard broke with a broad smile, and even Captain Low’s expression showed something not unlike approval.

“Spoken like a good marine!” Said Sir Nicolls.

“There you have it,” said Chevers. “Mr. Low, please note Corporal Gideon to detach and join the highland company at Spithead. And gentlemen, let us remind ourselves that the Admiral first gets his shore battery and gunboats. Now, where in God’s name is Dangerfield with our coffee?”

Based on real user tips, here’s exactly how to deep clean your thermos at home.

# 1. Deep Clean with Denture Cleaning Tablets

**Why it works:** Denture tablets like Polident or Steradent dissolve old coffee residue and neutralize odors inside stainless steel.

**How to use:**

* Drop **3-4 denture cleaning tablets** into your thermos.  
* Fill it with **hot water**.  
* Let it **soak for a few hours or overnight**.  
* Rinse thoroughly with clean water.  

**Best for:** Removing deep-set stains and strong odors.

# 2. Dishwasher Pod Hack

**Why it works:** Dishwasher tablets break down tough grime and leave steel interiors spotless.

**How to use:**

* Put **one dishwasher pod** into the thermos.  
* Fill it with **boiling water**.  
* Let it **sit for 30 minutes to an hour**.  
* Use a **bottle brush** to scrub, then rinse thoroughly.  

**Best for:** Fast deep clean, especially when the inside looks grimy.

# 3. Baking Soda and Vinegar Method (Natural Option)

**Why it works:** Baking soda lifts stains while vinegar breaks down mineral deposits and odors.

**How to use:**

* Add **2 tablespoons of baking soda** and **1 cup white vinegar**.  
* Fill with **hot water** and let it **fizz for 30 minutes**.  
* Scrub with a **bottle brush** and rinse.  

**Best for:** A chemical-free deep clean.

# 4. Bar Keepers Friend or Coffee Cleaner

**Why it works:** Specialty cleaners like Bar Keepers Friend, JoeGlo, or Urnex Clearly Coffee target coffee residue on steel surfaces.

**How to use:**

* Follow the **instructions on the cleaner**.  
* Soak with **hot water**, scrub with a **bottle brush**, rinse thoroughly.  

**Best for:** Heavy coffee build-up or stainless steel refresh.

# 5. Rice Shake Method (Scrubbing Action)

**Why it works:** Rice acts as a natural abrasive to scrub off residue.

**How to use:**

* Add **½ cup uncooked rice**, a few drops of **dish soap**, and **hot water**.  
* Close the lid and **shake vigorously** for 1-2 minutes.  
* Rinse well.  

**Best for:** Loosening stuck-on grime.

# Bonus Tips:

* Always **separate and clean lids, gaskets, and seals** — they hold odors too.  
* Skip bleach, it can damage stainless steel.  
* **Regular rinsing after use** prevents odors from setting in.  

For tough coffee smells, the **dishwasher pod soak** and **denture tablet soak** are the most effective. For natural cleaning, **baking soda and vinegar** works well. With these easy steps, your Stanley thermos will stay clean, odor-free, and ready for your next drink.",1,1752982290.0,KeepThisInMind,0,1.0,False

1m4erq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1m4erq6/union_battle_with_bucks_still_going/,UNION BATTLE WITH BUCKS STILL GOING?,"Full disclosure. I do not go to Starbucks. I make my own simple coffee at home as I work from home now... a while back,  When I was part of the corporate world, I was there daily for my ""Fraps""... I also was banned from ordering 4 shots of espresso with cream, sugar, drizzle of Carmel, Iced with whip cream... If I remember it was a specialty drink costing about 8$ but since I ordered the shots, and rest as add on, I paid about 3 or 4$ .... I called it a ""hack"" (I worked as an insurance agent in Boston downtown making a Wapping 29k a year!!!) So anything I could do to save money, I did So I could make my rent payment... I belive its no longer allowed to order in such manner.... 

Anyway, I saw a small video about a walk off in a Disney location. Managers, employees and bartista simply wanted to get attention to CEO about overworked, underpaid, and a 4 min rule- stressing everyone out, and being unattainable- 
So I looked at some data about nationwide # of locations, daily and annual revenue,  and then I recall the CEO flies in a private jet as a daily commute???? 
So I started thinking.... is the union battle still and issue with Starbucks, are employees still struggling to make rent? Has there been and positive bottom line help to employees in form of actual $ compensation? Higher pay? Bonus? Help with living expenses, education and promotion incentives?... based on my research there are about 16-17 thousand locations in the USA alone? 
Total US rev 2022 11.53 $ Billion 31.6$ Million a day in 16,000 locations??? 

Final questions: is there a battle with corporate against unions still to suppress demands and requests by employees management?

1m4eon1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/1m4eon1/the_important_thing_i_learned_from_a_recent_bout/,The important thing I learned from a recent bout with health anxiety,"Thirteen years ago I beat leukemia.  And ever since then I've had health anxiety.  It has gotten easier to control over the years, but it's always there - lurking, lingering in the back of my mind.  And recently it came storming back like a bat out of hell.

Back in March, I got a cyst removed from my eyelid that I'd had for over five years.  It never bothered me, but it had very slowly gotten a little bit bigger.  I thought it was a chalazion.  Pathology came back - it was a fibrous nodule with ""atypical mast cells, benign in nature"".  The recommendation was to get my blood tested, just to be sure. Not exactly what I wanted to hear.

About a week later, I suddenly had some issues involving my groin and left testicle.  It stuck around for a few days, and I started to worry.  Bathroom run at work? Testicular self-exam. Shower at home? Testicular self-exam. Sometimes more than five times per shower. Sleeping on my side, with my legs together, became nearly impossible because of this sensitivity. Then my mind really started to wander.  Are the eyeball cyst and this newfound issue somehow related?  Worrying led to Google.  Google led to Mast Cell Activation Syndrome.  MCAS led to an issue with my blood.  Again.  There it was.  It's back. Its been thirteen years, and it's back, in some crazy new way that's affecting two completely different parts of my body.

Instant gratification - I need to solve this, and solve it now.  I can't produce at my job with this weighing on me.  I can't wait to see a doctor.  I need this groin issue to go away - NOW.  I'm single - who the FUCK do I talk to about this?  So, I talked to a doctor on a video call while on my break at work.  $35 and you're connected to a ""doctor"" instantly.  She prescribed an antibotic - a potent antibiotic, thinking I had some sort of testicular infection.  Took that for 10 days, nothing changed.  I tried to suppress the worry, to work throught the stress.  I became impatient, impulsive, and rude.  I called my old oncologist, whom I hadn't spoken to in years.  I got up at work, walked out of my office, and called him in the parking lot.  I needed reassurance.  I needed answers.  He told me he couldn't diagnose me, but told me not to worry.  It didn't work.  I started to lose weight - a few coworkers commeted on it.  My muscles ached.  I downloaded an app which let me order Valtrex - antiviral for herpes, which I've never had.   I didn't know what else to do.  Had a urology appointment the following week, but couldn't wait for answers.

Fast forward a week, the Valtrex did nothing.  Its been three weeks and the issue hasn't gone away.  Every little bruise or itch I get has me thinking the worst.  I'm staring at myself in the mirror, dissecting what I see.  I notice that the left side of my neck is slightly larger than the right side (I've always had this).  ""It's a lymph node,"" I think.  I start aggressively feeling for a mass in my neck, before I go to bed, as I'm driving to work, while I'm at work, while I'm on the couch.  Imagining this swollen lymph node has me convinced that it's actually there.  Swollen lymph nodes can be a sign of leukemia.  I have to force myself to stop.  *""I have a bump on my eye, I'm losing a little weight, my testicle aches, I'm not eating as much, I have a mass in my neck.  I'm going to die.""*

Urologist does an exam, doesn't suspect an infection.  Can't find anything suspicious on the testicle.  Pee test comes back clear.  Does a basic physical exam, feels a tiny little protrusion.  ""I think you have a hernia,"" he says.  Imaging confirms this - not one, but THREE small hernias, all three in my inguinal canal (the groove at the hip, where the leg meets the groin).  I make an appointment to have them surgically fixed.  Turns out, they can cause referred issues to the entire area, including the private parts, because they move the nerves in that area around.  And he tells me that as my body gets used to the hernias, the symptoms should subside.

Within a few days, the issues with the groin and testicle completely disappear.  But, BUT!!  A new issue arises.  Constipation.  Bad constipation, and an associated loss of appetite.  No matter how hard I try, I can't go to the bathroom.  And when I take a softener, all that comes out is a little bit of liquid.  Not pretty, I know.  But this constipation persists.  I feel full fast.  And this leads to a whole new round of Googling.  These are things I actually Googled:

* inguinal hernia and constipation
* can inguinal hernias paralyze the bowel
* symptoms of bowel \*\*ncer
* prostate \*\*ncer and hernias
* how MCAS affects the bowel

So there I am, with one issue solved, but another one happening.  I can't help but think that all of this is related by some bigger, unknown, deadly cause.  Are the hernias *really* causing these digestion issues?  My dad, noticing the worry on my face, hands me a book called ""Fiber Fueled"".  It has now been since May 8th that I had that video call with the doctor.  I flip to the index and read every page that mentions constipation.  I decide to follow the book's advice.  I start eating sauerkraut by the forkfull.  Daily probiotics, magnesium, and fiber.  Lots of fiber.  No dairy, six different fresh sources of fiber a day.  I've never eaten as many kiwis in my life.  I become a new owner of a squatty potty.  I'm desperate to poop again, starting to worry that I'll never have another normal BM in my life.  That dreaded \*\*ncer word keeps sounding off in my mind.  Not for the testicle this time, but for the bowel.

Last Wednesday, I start to feel really gassy.  Probably a good thing, I think.  It means something's happening down there.  Then, a poop.  A small poop, but a poop nonetheless.  Friday for lunch, my boss orders food.  I wolf down a Five Guy's cheeseburger like there's no tomorrow, and realize that my appetite is back.  Yesterday?  I wake up.  Coffee, feeling like a poo.  And I sit, and OH, THE GLORY!!!! WHAT A POOP!!! Followed by anoher one at lunch.  And another one, four hours later.  I'm releasing massive amounts of it, weeks of blockage.  It is a magical day.

And then this morning, I sit up in bed and realize....that the stress is gone.  That I feel happy.  That I *want* to eat breakfast.  I go to the gym, run five miles on the treadmill.  Eat a big lunch, no bloat.

I'm back.

And that's the story about how several unrelated things, and some bad timing, and some panic, led me down a very dark path for the last 2 1/2 months.  The eye thing?  Completely unrelated to everything else.  I just chose to have it sent to pathology right before my lower half went haywire.  Benign, like the pathology report had originally said.  The testicular/groin issue?  Three small hernias, that I probably got at the gym, and aggravated during a particularly labor intensive day at work (sometimes, I'm out in the field).  The constipation?  A gut imbalance, my intestines completely wrecked by the medications I took for the testicle issue, poor decisions that I made in a state of panic.  Medications that were completely unnecessary and did NOTHING but harm.  Medications that made me sore and suppressed my appetite.  A gut imbalance that was healed by some probiotics, prunes, patience, and kiwis.

And so, what I've learned is that if there's a simple explanation, and a simple path to follow, that is usually the right answer.  For me, thinking that I was dying (thanks, Google!) was really a few hernias and a simple case of disbyosis, healed by following the program in that book my dad handed to me.  The first time he told me ""you need to eat more fruits and vegetables"", I shrugged it off - I almost laughed at him.

""*What's going on here is way more complicated than that!""*

Turns out, it wasn't.  And all that stress, all that panic, all that worry that I've had since early May, was avoidable.  I made it worse by giving in to the anxiety, and by making brash decisions in the heat of the moment.

The mind is a very powerful thing.  Through a combination of anxiety and stress, I had *convinced* myself I was sick, so much so that I created a lump in my neck that was never really there. So much so that the stress in my body said hey, let's stop eating for a little while.  Let's lose a little weight.

So, the next time you're going through it, take a step back, breathe, stay off of Google, and remember that the human body is very, very good at solving its own issues.  Don't let the panic take over.  Drink water, eat healthy, sleep, and do the basics.  Breathe.",4,1752981364.0,HealthAnxiety,1,1.0,False

I hate that I don’t feel like me and they get to carry on with their hobbies, socializing, fun activities, and living life the same as before. 

I want to be financially compensated which sounds stupid but its not fair I am carrying the weight of this while their life stays the same. I want them to suffer in some way since I am. I know it sounds rude but I am pissed off and upset and hate this. 

Can anyone relate? I feel mean but also its how I feel and its fair for me to feel this way, right?",1,1752981228.0,abortion,1,1.0,False
1m4emcu,https://i.redd.it/0j2shvmy4ydf1.png,"Mr. Denver - I ran towards the bus stop with my 7 cm high heels, 2 duffel bags and 2 cups of latte.","I ran towards the bus stop with my 7 cm high heels, 2 duffel bags and 2 cups of latte. My heart dropped when the bus just left and I looked around to see an empty taxi because I only have 18 minutes left before the devil himself leaves the office to go to a meeting.



Shit.



Chapter image

The office is 12 blocks away and it will take me around 20 minutes to arrive there if I'm running my ass there. But I can't run again, this 2 bags are so heavy and I bet I will spill the latte everywhere. I gulped nervously and looked for an empty taxi. I tried to wave my hand trying to get a taxi.



""You! Brunette with 2 duffel bags! Hop in!"" I turned to see a taxi driver waving at me. I quickly ran towards him and got inside.



""Denver office please.. 6 blocks away.. please.. be fast.. or my boss will kill me."" I said completely knocked out.



""Roger that!"" The taxi driver said as he stepped on the gas. I checked my phone right away to see if the devil needs anything else. I smiled when I saw there's no message from him.



I turned my head to the driver and saw his name on the dashboard. His name is Eddy Brown and I think he's in his 40s. I took a really deep breath and let it out slowly.



""You know.. I'm completely surprised to see a skinny girl like you carrying 2 big duffel bags."" He said as he glanced at me through the mirror. I chuckled sadly and sighed.



""People always said that and I think that's why my boss hired me."" I said as I turned my head to the window.



""I'm Eddy by the way."" He said in a really friendly tone. I turned to him and smiled.



""I'm Dakota and thank you for calling me earlier."" I said chuckling.



Chapter image

""Your welcome and here you go."" He said as he pulled up right in front of my office building. I gave him 20 dollars and got out from the taxi real quick.



""Dakota, here's the change!"" I heard Eddy calling me and I turned to him kneeling a little bit. I smiled at him and said, ""Keep it.. you saved me today and I hope you have a great day, Eddy."" I said as I waved at him.



""Thankyou and you too!"" He said and I nodded. I checked my watch and I ran inside the building quickly. I gestured everyone in front of me to get out of my way. I felt like I'm Moses from the bible.. you know when God asked him to split the sea. I'm splitting people out of my way.



I have 3 minutes left and I pressed the lift button as quickly as possible hoping that it will come faster. I gulped nervously looking at all 6 lifts, waiting for one of them to open their freaking door.



Come on come on..



Ding.



Chapter image

I ran towards the lift on my right and got inside quickly. I pressed the number 20 because that's where the devil's lair at. I gulped nervously and glared at people who were going to press the button outside. The lift door closed and it's going up. I kept looking at my watch nervously and then I looked at the numbers anxiously too.



Come on.. oh come on!



When the number stopped at 20, I couldn't help but smile widely. I ran towards the devil's office and knocked twice before going inside. He's currently on the phone and he gestured me to come inside. I walked in and closed the door slowly. I put the 2 big duffel bags beside his desk and put the 2 cups of lattes on his desk.



Chapter image

He always drinks 2 cups of latte everyday at 2 p.m and yes he's that weird. He loves his coffee after lunch and he loves his coffee from Starbucks. I stood there waiting for him to give me another task but he suddenly pointed at the glass window. I quickly took the remote and turned the blinds on.



He took his latte sipping it as he talked on the phone. He gestured me to sit down and I took out my notes quickly because I bet he's going to make me do a lot of things after this. He ended the call and he sat down on his chair.



""Cancel all of my schedules until Saturday, I'm going to Vancouver."" He said and my eyes widen.



Oh shit! Oh no..



""What's your plan in Vancouver, Mr. Denver?"" I asked him as I fixed my glasses because it's slowly slipping down. I started to cross his schedules from tomorrow until Saturday.



""Just book a ticket for me and you're not coming."" He said in his usual cold tone. I smiled secretly inside my heart because it means I have 4 days of holiday. I don't have to serve the devil for 4 days and that's a really good news.



""Yes, Mr. Denver. Should I book an early flight or?"" I asked as I took out my iPad from my bag.



""The earliest flight tomorrow and the last flight on Saturday."" He said as he's pointing his pen at me. I wrote it in my journal and then I turned my head to him again.



Chapter image

""Do you need anything else?"" I asked and he's currently sipping his coffee.



""You're in charge of checking the construction when I'm gone."" He said and that made me look at him in horror.



""Isn't that Bob's job?"" I asked in a really careful tone.



""I just fired him. He brought 2 girls into his office and had sex when he's supposed to give me an update."" My boss said as he looked at his computer screen. I looked down sadly because I thought I was going to have a 4 days holiday but.. he ended up giving me more work.



""Is that all, Mr. Denver?"" I asked as I started to put my things inside my bag.



""Send me the tickets and you know what to do right?"" He asked.



""Yes."" I said as I turned to him. He gestured me to go out right away. I got up from my seat and walked out of his office. I walked towards my office and threw myself to the sofa.



Suddenly my phone rang and I quickly took it out of my bag. When I saw the name on my phone screen, I immediately pressed the red button. My phone rang again still.. the same name shows up.



Chapter image

""What do you want?"" I hissed as I decided to answer the call. I put the call on the loud speaker because I don't have the damn energy to hold my phone to my ear.



""What?!""



""Grandpa is dying.."" My dad said and I rolled my eyes.



""You can't fool me this time, dad."" I said in a cold tone.



""I swear I'm not kidding this time."" He said in a really serious tone.



""I'm busy.. so stop joking ar-"" My dad turned on the camera and my eyes widen to see my Grandpa at the hospital.



""I'm not lying.""



""Fine.. I'll be there."" I hissed and I ended the call. I quickly got up from my sofa and sat on my work chair. I started to cancel all Mr. Denver's schedule by calling everyone that's involve in that schedule. I started to book him a ticket to Vancouver and a ticket for myself to LA.



After finish rescheduling, I walked towards my boss' office. I knocked and then walked inside.



""Mr. Denver, I think I have to go to LA tomorrow morning."" I said and he looked up to me.



Chapter image

""Why is that?"" He asked.



""My grandfather is dying, my dad just called me earlier informing that I have to go home."" I said.



""Go.. you have 2 days and ask Cindy to replace you.""



""Her name is Cynthia."" I corrected him and he turned to me gesturing me to go. I gave him the place ticket details and then he gestured to go out immediately. I walked back to my office and work again.",1,1752981166.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Someone you can share the most trivial, mundane crap with and someone who will walk with you through life’s toughest times. Someone who loves sharing a laugh, but is willing to pull you in for a hug when you need to break down and cry. I’ve come dangerously close to finding my bro here a few times now. Seems like things always swerve off the rails. Usually leaving me confused, hurt and frankly, heartbroken. But here I am, trying one last time, in hopes I can finally find my bro.

About me:
I'm 56, married (to a woman), a tech professional (second career) and servant to two spoiled chihuahuas. I love travel, enjoy my nerdy hobbies, I’m always in the middle of a book (or two), am a coffee snob and a foodie with the body type to prove it.

What I'm looking for in a bro:
Somewhere close to Tampa Bay/West Central Florida. Probably age 25-40 just for sake of shared life experience. A conversationalist who's able to respond with complete sentences of more than a word or two. If your only interests are sports, working out or having your face in front of a TV or in a video game, I'm not the bro for you. I wouldn't expect contact all day, every day, but at the very least a least a few times a week so we could get to know each other.

Also someone who appreciates my 14-year-old sense of humor and who's willing to talk about everything from the kind of chips you like to your secret hopes and dreams and anything and everything in between. If we click, I'd want the possibility of meeting over coffee or lunch. Then maybe a walk through Lettuce Lake or Lake Parker or Shingle Creek (when it cools off). Maybe a trip to Shangri-La to chill out. The occasional movie night. Maybe a road trip to Riviera Beach some day to snorkel... Just some general bro fun. You should be warned I’m a hugger and not afraid of platonic physical affection.

1m4ekux,https://www.reddit.com/r/nocontact/comments/1m4ekux/he_broke_no_contact_to_sort_things_out_i_chose/,"He broke no contact to ""sort things out"". I chose peace.","So basically, I asked him for a couple months of space so I could learn to love myself and be a stronger woman. I wanted to figure out how to stop being such a people pleaser and actually stick to the boundaries I set because I felt unloved and disrespected most of the time in our relationship. I thought that if I took time to focus on myself first, we might have a stronger relationship later. I think I was also hoping he would take that time to better himself too.

But instead, he said the heartbreak was too much and told me he wanted to end things. I agreed, and we’ve been no contact since.

He texted me today saying he was cleaning his room and wanted to give back all the gifts I had made him over the year. I told him he could just leave the box at my mailbox. I think I messed up by saying “I hope to see you again once I’ve grown into a better version of myself” or something dumb like that. Then he said he has a lot he wants to say to me and asked if we could meet for coffee tomorrow to talk and “sort things out.”

But I know myself. If I saw him, I’d want to run right back to him, and nothing would change. He’d see I’m still soft for him and just keep treating me the same. So I told him I’m standing firm on what I said before, that I still need a couple months, and that maybe it’s best we leave things as they are, especially if he’s not willing to wait.

In my head, if you really love someone, wouldn’t you be willing to give them time to work on themselves? Not take it personally? Or maybe I’m just delusional and living in a fairytale.

It just confuses me because he was the one who wanted to end things, and now suddenly he wants to fix them? When all I originally asked for was space? Does that make any sense?

Anyway, I’m really proud of myself for standing my ground. I just hope I can keep growing and stop letting people walk all over me.

TL;DR Asked for space to grow, he ended things. Broke no contact 8 days later asking to meet. I stayed firm and said no.",1,1752981032.0,nocontact,0,1.0,False

1m4eftq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1m4eftq/things_changed_suddenly_after_a_great_month_not/,Things changed suddenly after a great month – not sure what to think,"I (20M) met a girl (19F) on Tinder, and after a week of messaging, we met up. Over the next 3 weeks, we went on about 6 dates—beach, coffee/lunch, and hanging at each other’s places (we both still live at home and have met each other’s parents). We messaged regularly, flirted, joked around, and really connected.

Last weekend, I went to her place after work to watch a movie. It got late, and although I offered to head home, she let me stay—just in the spare room, as she felt things might be moving too fast. I respected that. The next morning we got coffee, talked about future plans, and arranged a midweek catch-up for drinks.

But after that, her texts changed—shorter, less frequent, and distant. She cancelled our next date due to bad weather (which wasn’t that bad), then said she needed to focus on family because of her sick Pop and a struggling parent. I sent a kind message (no reply), then followed up the next day. She replied: “I appreciate your thoughts, my family is going through a tough time.” I told her I understood and could give her space. She said she just needs time to think. I told her to let me know when she’s up for a chat, and she said “I will – I appreciate it.”

Everything had been going so well, but maybe it moved too fast and she got scared. I don’t want to overstep, especially since she asked for space, but I also don’t want her to think I’m not interested. I’m not very experienced and this change blindsided me.

Do you think it’s over? Should I just keep giving her space? When (if ever) should I check in again? Do girls sometimes just need time to process?  
I guess my biggest worry is that she lost interest—even though nothing before this suggested that—and I won’t hear from her again.

But with no success. Following is the problem I am facing, followed by things I have already tried. Will really appreciate some insight especially by seasoned coffee enthusiasts.

Thanks in Advance


Problem: VANTRO machine lets you set time of extraction as well. At first I set at 26secs. Used 14-15gms of coffee fine grind. Tamped as well as I could in an unpressurized basket bought seperately. However the output is waayyyy more than 1:2. Initially the output was around 52-53 gms. 

Things I tried:

1. I tried to get a much finer grind from 2 different roasters (incase my arago home grinder is not capable enough). Tamped even more precisely and harder. Output reduced but only by a few gms... Went from 53 to rough 47-48. In this case even the puck came out sludgy 

2. I tried to reduce the programmed time from 26t o around 22secs. Again it reduced slightly but nowhere near 1:2 ratio. Still above 40 gms from 14gm of coffee.

Basically i am getting a feeling that based on what time I set the machine is set to dispense a certain amount of water in the portafilter... And that amount doesn't seem inline with what is recommended for an ideal shot. If I want to reduce the amount though i will have drastically reduce the extraction time which also is not ideal. How do I solve this?


Again please feel free to ask for more info if needed and enlightenment me if I have taken some wrong assumption somewhere.

1m4eadj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m4eadj/aioim_getting_more_and_more_impatient_with/,AIO-I’m getting more and more impatient with “hormones” being the reason my sister mistreats me.,"Before I get started, I love my sister. Nothing will take away from that. I am 16M and she is 13F and 50% of the time, she is lovely to be around. She’s really funny at times and I enjoy that side of her. 

The other half of the time, she can be the most rude, insensitive, nasty, cutthroat, mean, and provoking person. For starters, just to list off some things, she will:

Purposefully try to make me look bad in front of company and family

Call my passion for music “stupid” 

Always make sure to dig at me for my parents buying me a really nice and expensive saxophone that I will use for the rest of my life.

Call me names

Makes fun of my body (she does this a lot more to my little brother 10M who has a bit of a stomach which is just cruel)

Swears and cusses at me and my parents a lot. 
Calls me a little bitch, tells be to stfu, gives us the finger constantly, and cusses way too casually in front of my parents. (I rarely swear in front of my parents)


Huge hoarder. Like I can’t use her electric scooter to go grab a coffee 5 mins away ( I don’t drive yet) while she’s at a sleep over because “i didn’t ask” but even if I did she would tell me no unless I bribe her. She didn’t even pay for it but it’s “hers”.

Super defensive. If you try to blame or tell her off she gets super defensive and aggressive. It’s infuriating. (This behavior has rubbed off into my brother and now he is also a very defensive person just in a more sensitive and tearful way rather than her yelling or snapping. He also spends too much time alone on his computer or playing basketball in the driveway so that could also be a factor. He’s also just an emotional kid and always has been.

Loves to fuel a fire

Generally says demoralizing things to me.

On top of all of this which has gotten way worse over the past year, I have never gotten a genuine apology or have seen real effort to change her behavior. The only apology I’ll get is when my parents force her to give a snappy “SORRY”. Every time she pulls this and hurts me she never apologizes and just moves on as if I moved on and she never said anything.

I obviously have brought my concerns to my parents they always give the same speeches and reasons that just really erk me now. It’s always “period cramps” or “anxiety” or THIS one makes me angry, “teenage girl hormones”. Look, everyone has their moments and they can be due to their hormones or testosterone or period cramps or etc, but this is like daily routine at this point. She genuinely becomes one of the meanest people I know and says some of the meanest stuff I’ve had said to my face almost every other day. To just push it as “hormones” is honestly super disheartening to me because the things she has said and done to me legitimately caused me emotional pain, trauma, and anxiety. Her hormones shouldn’t have to become my burden like they have and do this to me because it’s just becoming more and more apparent that she might just be a really toxic and nasty person and my parents are missing the point. And again, the other times she’s NOT like this, I enjoy her company, but her other bad side is staining the good one for me, too. 

And it’s always the same promise that “she’ll grow out of it” but what if she doesn’t and is just mean to me forever. And even if she does, it doesn’t make what she already has done right. Unlike my parents, who I assume want time and therapy to gradually solve it, the person who is actually dealing with a massive and different part of the burden (not that my sister is a burden or that my parents don’t feel it because she has said some terrible stuff to them before), I want this to end and I want a genuine apology and plan/promise for going forward.",2,1752980083.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False
1m4e9vn,https://i.redd.it/w4qseynn1ydf1.jpeg,Gigil ako sa mga pakielamero sa mga nasa coffee shop,"For context, vinideo yung customer (hindi kita ang face) kasi nag-use siya ng extension to charge their laptop. Of course, we know the intention of posting this, to make the person look like they’ve been staying in the coffee shop for too long to need their laptop charged there. Yep, mali naman talaga to use an extension cord, especially since you're in a coffee shop, it’s not your house. But can we give the person the benefit of the doubt as to why they needed to do that? There are multiple possible reasons why they’re charging there. Maybe they need to finish something ASAP and don’t have time to go home? Maybe wala silang kuryente sa bahay at that time kaya nandiyan sila? Or maybe they really need to be in the coffee shop kasi hindi healthy ang environment sa bahay — to the point na they can't even mentally focus and finish what they’re doing?

It may not be proper for you, but people have their own reasons for doing things like that. As long as they’re not disturbing you or other customers, and you’re not even there regularly enough to actually observe if they’re always doing it, then I don’t think you have the right to give an opinion about what they’re doing, let alone post them on social media knowing it might just lure people who want to join the hate train.

Just my everyday personal reminder: people are going through tons of shit you don’t even know about, and they could be in the worst state of their life, just trying to function and show up. So don’t mind anyone. Let them do their own business. 🙂

This isn’t just for the person who got posted, but also for people who choose to stay in coffee shops to quietly study or work instead of staying at home. You have your own reasons why you need to stay there. Just make sure you’re not disturbing or causing inconvenience to other customers.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Hanshin Tigers vs. Yomiuri Giants: A Rivalry with a Rock ‘n’ Roll Twist**

The eternal NPB rivalry between the Hanshin Tigers and Yomiuri Giants kicks off again on July 20, and this time, the Tigers are coming in like a Mrs. GREEN APPLE power ballad—unstoppable and with a catchy hook. Let’s break down why the Tigers should dominate this Tokyo Dome showdown, blending stats, news, and a dash of musical metaphors.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Tigers Roar, Giants Stumble

The betting lines make the Tigers the clear favorites, with most books pricing them between **1.56 (Fanatics)** and **1.67 (LowVig.ag)** on the moneyline. That translates to an implied probability of **60-64%** to win—strong enough to suggest the Giants might need a wake-up call (or a second coffee). The spread favors the Tigers by **1.5 runs**, while totals hover around **4.5-5.0 runs**, with “Under” priced slightly higher. This hints at a pitcher’s duel, but don’t count on a snoozer—the Tigers’ recent extra-innings thriller against the Giants proves this rivalry has fireworks in its DNA.

---

### News Digest: Tigers Bring the Beat, Giants Bring the Pressure

The Tigers are riding high after their **4-0 extra-innings dismantling of the Giants** last week, fueled by **Satoshi Sato** and **Takahiro Sakamoto**’s back-to-back home runs. Their starter, **Morimasa Murakami**, pitched 6 shutout innings, showing why he’s a fortress on the mound. Now, they’ll turn to **Yoshinobu Takahashi**, who earned his **6th win of the season** with 7 strong innings against the Yakult Swallows. Takahashi’s not just a pitching ace—he’s a music connoisseur, claiming **“Lilac” by Mrs. GREEN APPLE** as his anthem. Let’s hope he doesn’t get so lost in the melody that he forgets to throw strikes.

Meanwhile, the Giants face a daunting task: defending their Tokyo Dome turf against a Tigers squad that just showed them how to win ugly. Their recent **4-0 loss** still stings, and while their lineup boasts star power, they’ll need to solve Tak

it’s so funny & cute to watch her play with it, but it’s really wasteful having to give her new cups every time. i tried plastic cups but she ended up breaking those/it would leave sharp edges that i did not feel comfortable letting her have anymore.

I’ve been working at this tech company for like 3 years now. Pretty chill place, and I go into the office maybe 2-3 times a week just to get out of the house. There’s maybe 15 of us who do that regularly. One of them is my manager (she’s in her 40s, married, super normal), and we usually grab lunch together because we get along and… we’re in the same building. Nothing weird.

Anyway, this guy I work with we’ll call him Kyle started acting really weird. Like giving me attitude in meetings, being short when I’d say hi, stuff like that. I figured maybe he was just going through something. Then a friend in HR casually mentioned there was an anonymous ethics complaint… and somehow, I was involved.

Turns out Kyle filed a report claiming I was “inappropriately involved” with our manager. Because… we eat together. That’s literally it. We share salad recommendations and bitch about the coffee machine. That’s the whole affair.

HR had to pull both of us in, which was mortifying. Our manager actually laughed at first because she thought it was a joke. Spoiler: It wasn’t. Kyle doubled down and said we had a “suspicious relationship” and it’s “obvious why I get special treatment.” (I don’t. I still had to chase down my own PTO approval like everyone else.)

The funny part? After they looked into it, HR told him to knock it off. Apparently he was leaving passive aggressive crap in the break room too stuff like “some people get ahead by eating with the right people.” Super subtle.

Now he just avoids me and glares at my lunch like it personally betrayed him.

TL;DR: My coworker thought I was hooking up with my boss because we eat together. Reported me to HR. It backfired and now he’s the one on thin ice.",96,1752979475.0,coworkerstories,21,0.98,False

## **The Grinner**

---

The tagline was *“He’s Coming for You.”*

It was supposed to be a **viral promo** for *The Grinner*, a low-budget slasher flick with a big studio marketing budget. The Grinner wore a cheap smiling mask and carried a plastic hammer. In the trailer, he popped out of closets, alleys, car trunks, eyes unblinking as he raised the hammer.

The studio needed buzz. The last test screening had tanked, focus groups calling it “predictable,” “too slow,” “not scary.”

Then some junior marketing exec suggested it:

> “What if we hire a guy to *be* the Grinner in public? Like… jump-scare people. Record the reactions for TikTok, Insta reels. Organic terror.”

They could see the headline already: **“The Grinner Terrorizes Midtown (And People Are Loving It).”**

The VP signed off before the meeting ended.

---

They found **Ray** on a gig app. He was quiet in the interview, nodding politely as they explained the plan.

“You’ll have a mask. A prop hammer. Just scare people. They’ll scream, laugh, post it, tag us.”

Ray nodded again. His references checked out—he’d done street theater once, a couple of birthday clown gigs, a living statue stint in Times Square.

They gave him the mask and the hammer.

Ray held the hammer for a long moment, tilting it side to side, listening to it catch the light.

“Remember,” the exec said, “no actual violence. We just need them scared enough to post.”

Ray smiled behind the mask.

---

The first video went up the next morning.

Ray stepped from a parking garage shadow, raised the hammer, tilted his head. A woman screamed, dropping her coffee, her boyfriend yanking her back as Ray froze, then shuffled backward, waving with a goofy tilt of the head.

The video hit 800,000 views in hours.

“Keep it up,” the exec texted.

---

By Day 3, *The Grinner* was trending #2 on TikTok.

By Day 4, a man was found dead in an alley near 9th Avenue, a hammer blow caving in his skull. Witnesses said they saw a guy in a smiling mask drifting away into the shadows.

Police asked the studio for details.

“Probably a copycat,” the exec said, sweating, phone buzzing with more notifications of ticket pre-sales spiking.

They told Ray to lay low.

Ray didn’t.

---

He liked the way people screamed.

He liked the way the hammer felt when it connected, the soft give of flesh, the crunch underneath.

He left the bodies in alleys, bathrooms, stairwells, each one neatly posed with the smiling mask turned toward traffic cameras.

Every murder meant another spike in hashtags:
\#TheGrinner
\#TooScaredToSleep
\#ISawHim

---

The studio *tried* to call it off, but the president of marketing pulled them aside:

> “Look at the numbers.”

Theaters that were half-empty last month were sold out. Merchandise sold online. Streaming pre-orders lined up for the VOD release.

They hired private security to keep their offices safe, issued statements of “condemnation,” but never took down the campaign.

---

Ray moved through the city with the confidence of someone whose face was no longer his own.

He became *The Grinner*.

Every street reflection was him.

Every shriek fed the darkness inside him, which felt *cleaner* now that it had a purpose.

---

They finally caught him in a busted apartment near the river, the hammer still warm, blood on his sleeves, mask pushed up like a hat. Cops with ARs and body cams yelling, kicking him down, zip-tying his arms.

Ray didn’t fight.

They dragged him out while bystanders filmed, the camera flashes strobing across the mask.

His last words before they shoved him into the van were:

> “You’re welcome for the tickets.”

---

*The Grinner* opened to record box office numbers that weekend.

Critics called it “eerily prophetic,” “the scariest movie of the year,” “a mirror held to society’s love of fear.”

The victims were buried quietly, overshadowed by opening-weekend celebrations, interviews with the cast, and red carpet clips of influencers wearing replica Grinner masks.

Someone started a candle vigil hashtag:
\#GrinnerVictims

But it never trended as high as #TheGrinnerLives.

---  

The conference room was all glass and high-rise views, morning rain streaking down the windows, blurring the skyline.

The **junior exec**, now a senior, scrolled through numbers on a tablet:  
– Opening weekend: record-breaking.  
– Merch: sold out.  
– Streaming pre-orders: stacked for weeks.  

On the wall-mounted screen behind him, the **real footage** played in a muted loop:  
– Ray, in the Grinner mask, stepping out of the shadows.  
– A woman screaming, dropping her phone as she runs.  
– Ray tilting his head, waving the hammer, the mask’s smile locked in place.  
– The frozen image of Ray being dragged into the police van, blood on his sleeves, the mask still perched on his head like a crown.  

The **Head of Marketing** sipped coffee, eyes on the numbers, not the footage.

“Are we sure it isn’t too… soon?” someone asked near the end of the table.

The Head of Marketing glanced at the muted footage of Ray’s real arrest, then at the screen with the sales data.

“It’s exactly the right time.”

Someone else cleared their throat, “Legal says we can’t explicitly say it’s based on Ray. But we can… imply.”

The Head of Marketing nodded. “We don’t need to say it. They’ll know.”

On the screen, Ray’s head tilted, the mask’s smile shining in the flashing police lights.

A young assistant hesitated, “What’s the tagline?”

The Head of Marketing smiled, slow, cold.

> “The Grinner Returns.”

They sat in silence for a moment, the footage looping, the screams captured forever in digital clarity, the numbers rolling up like a scoreboard in the corner of the screen.

> “Greenlight it.”

They stood, coffee cups in hand, stepping past the screen as Ray’s hammer dropped, frozen in the frame, the real and the fiction merged.

Outside, the city kept moving, rain falling softly, washing nothing away.

And in the quiet corners of the studio offices, where the junior marketing exec now wore a better suit and sipped better coffee, no one said it out loud.

But they all thought it.

> All press is good press.

I suspected I’ve had it for years and years now (I am 27) but never had a decent psychiatrist who would listen to me until now. Anyway, today I started on 20 mg and I was cautiously optimistic, but really didn’t think it would do anything as it’s such a low dose, and also I’m so used to suffering inside my brain that I genuinely felt it was too good to be true. But I really could not have had a better first day! I woke up and took it around 9:30 with a few crackers (all I could muster bc I can’t really stomach anything in the mornings). My brain was racing like always and I had a song stuck in my head so I tried to go back to sleep to no avail, lol. I had planned to go clothes shopping for a few things so eventually I got up and went. There was no magic moment where I felt it kick in but looking back, normally I would have procrastinated leaving the house for like an hour. I noticed my shopping experience was actually pleasant as opposed to overwhelming and a sensory nightmare. I didn’t waste time putzing around, freezing in aisles unable to make decisions. The people around me weren’t pissing me off by just existing. When I checked out and got back to my car, I didn’t sit there and overthink my next move for 10 minutes. Usually I’d be paralyzed trying to decide if I want to go get coffee or food, what do I want, how many calories does everything have, etc. I just decided what I wanted without even really thinking about it. Typically, I would be wiped out from this one outing and need to rot the rest of the day. But I was actually able to go back out and thrift a little bit with my fiance. I typically have such a hard time going back out after I get home from somewhere so that was really amazing to me 😂 

Just wanted to share my experience because I am so pleasantly surprised. It makes me want to cry tears of joy and also sadness that I’ve been struggling for so long and just accepting it. The only negative side effect I experienced was no interest in food, but I’m also on Zepbound and losing weight so I’m not that upset by it. Just have to make sure I try extra hard to get nutrition in. Thank you for listening if you made it this far. ❤️

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters vs. Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles: A Statistical Slapstick**

**Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
The Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters are the prohibitive favorites here, with odds hovering around **1.51 to 1.59 (decimal)** across bookmakers. That translates to an implied probability of **63-65%** to win—basically, the chance your morning coffee will spill if you jaywalk while checking your phone. Meanwhile, the Rakuten Eagles are priced at **2.3 to 2.5**, implying a **38-42%** chance, which is about the same odds as your local weatherman correctly predicting snow in July.

The spread is **Fighters -1.5**, meaning they’re expected to win by *at least two runs*. Considering the Fighters’ recent 19-game winning streak and their ability to score from anywhere in the lineup (Reyes alone has 20 home runs this season), this isn’t a spread—it’s a *gentleman’s agreement*. The total runs line sits at **6.5**, with the over slightly more expensive. Given the Fighters’ offense (they’ve scored 6+ runs in 82% of their last 10 games) and Rakuten’s shaky pitching, the over might be the safer bet than a blindfolded toddler picking the correct Powerball numbers.

**Digest the News: A Tale of Two Teams**  
The Fighters are currently riding a 19-game winning streak, a feat so absurd it makes a vending machine that only sells victories look predictable. Their starting pitcher, **Katsuki Katsura** (7-6, 2.38 ERA in 29 starts), is a statistical enigma—like a sushi roll that somehow tastes better with every bite. The Fighters’ lineup? A nuclear reactor of consistency. Tetsuto Yamada, Reyne Smith, and Manabu Sato have combined for 47 home runs this season, which is roughly the number of complaints you’d get from a stadium full of people if you tried to sell them expired hot dogs.

The Eagles, meanwhile, are the sports equivalent of a “Do Not Disturb” sign. They’ve lost 10 of their last 12 games to Hokkaido, including a 3-game series where the Fighters scored 27 runs total—enough to make a mathematician

# Chapter 1 - Golden Memories

I still think back. I think back and just remember her. Her golden-blonde hair glowed in the sunlight. It reminds me of days when we were younger. The sun always seemed to be shining when I was with her. I miss her laugh, her soft chuckle, which brought a warmth that settled deep inside me. I wish I could go back and relive it all over again. Even if it was met with the same fate, I would still go back to enjoy the short while we had. It's impossible to go about my life the same way without her. She brings me hope—hope that I might one day just be able to stand beside her again. I don't go a day without thinking about my Maya. Some may think it's unhealthy, but I don't really have a choice.



We met during high school.



The cafeteria was a symphony of chaos, a carefully orchestrated pandemonium that, for most people, just equaled lunchtime. For me, it was work. Constant, draining work. The fluorescent lights hummed a relentless, high-pitched whine that vibrated in my teeth. The clatter of trays, a metallic avalanche echoing off the tile floor, overlapped with shrieking bursts of laughter and the low, rumbling drone of a hundred conversations. Smells warred in the air: disinfectant battling stale pizza, sickly sweet syrup from the milk cartons clashing with the vinegary tang of cheap ketchup. It was a sensory assault, a battlefield I had to navigate twice a day.



I stood near the entrance, clutching my lunch bag, a small island of order in the swirling chaos. I scanned the room, my gaze moving in deliberate, short bursts. I was looking for Maya. I usually met her by the far wall, near the windows that overlooked the patchy grass of the football field. She seemed to move through the chaos with a kind of grace I envied, as if she had a volume knob in her head that could tune out the noise.



Then I saw her, sitting at a table by herself, staring out the window. Her expression was… muted. Like a radio turned down low. I navigated the crowded aisles, my gaze fixed on her as a steady point in the swirling landscape. When I reached the table, she blinked as if just noticing me, and her face shifted. The muted expression lifted like a slow sunrise, a faint warmth spreading across her features. Her smile reached her eyes, crinkling the corners, and for a moment, the cafeteria noise seemed to recede.



""Hey Liam,"" she questioned. ""Did you do well on that math test?""

""Of course,"" I replied. ""At least, I think I did. Won't know until Monday.""

Maya looked at me comfortingly. ""You always do well. It's not fair, really. Anyway, I had an idea. I hope you're free this weekend because I was wondering if you wanted to go somewhere?"" She asked with a dramatically large grin.



""I'm free,"" I said, already excited. ""I'm guessing it's a surprise? You know I don't like surprises.""

Maya squinted. ""How'd you know? But trust me, this time you'll like it!""

I believed her. Any time with Maya was going to be a good time.

That weekend, she revealed the surprise: Northwood Botanical Garden. It was the place we’d go on our first real date. We walked for what felt like hours, sunlight filtering through the canopy of ancient trees. Finally, we found a secluded bench overlooking a field of wildflowers. The sun perfectly illuminated her hair.



""School ends in just a few weeks,"" Maya said, breaking the silence. ""I figured this would be a good way to start our senior summer.""

I was ready for summer; I had already received my college acceptance letter. I wasn't sure what her plan was yet, and the fear of us splitting ways was a constant, low hum of anxiety. I smiled, trying to hide my thoughts about the future. ""It's going to be a great summer, just like the last one.""



Looking out at the fields of flowers, then back at Maya, with the birds chirping and the sun glowing, a fire built inside of me. I could sit there with her and watch the clouds my whole life and die a happy man. But every second felt like a countdown to when she might reveal she was leaving. The contradicting feelings made me anxious, and I stood from the bench.

Maya stood beside me and took my hand, gently resting her head on my shoulder. ""Dance with me,"" she whispered.



I wasn't one to dance, especially in public, but with Maya, I felt I could do anything. So I took her hand, and we danced, swaying slowly among the flowers, both wishing it would last forever. I looked into her eyes, and for a fleeting second, I saw a shift in her smile, a momentary distance in her gaze. My heart sank. I worried this was it, our final goodbye.

""Maya,"" I couldn't hide my fear anymore. ""I'm worried about next year. I'm going to college here. What are you doing?""



Maya looked into my eyes, and her grin returned, bright and reassuring. ""I'm glad you asked. I got the job here in town! I'm staying! Sorry, I waited so long, I just wanted to tell you the good news during something special.""

I was speechless, overjoyed. The flicker of distance in her eyes still concerned me, as if she was hiding something else, but I decided to forget about it and enjoy the rest of our perfect day.

# Chapter 2 - Subtle Shifts



College felt like a half-awake existence—lectures, study sessions, and too-strong campus coffee. But evenings belonged to Maya. After the long drive back from campus, I’d find her waiting, and the shift from the rigid cadence of academia to the unpredictable warmth of her world was always a relief. She worked at a local bookstore, surrounded by stories that seemed to speak truths far better than those we lived with.

About three months into my first semester, I sensed a quiet ripple in her usual rhythm. We were having dinner when I realized her responses to my stories about my cryptography professor were just curt nods and half-smiles.

""Everything alright?"" I finally asked.



For an instant, she looked startled, as if surprised by my presence. Her eyes, still that familiar warm hazel, held a hint of something distant. ""I'm fine,"" she replied, her voice edged with weariness. ""Just tired from work.""



""You sure? You seem… somewhere else tonight.""

She carefully set her glass down. ""Ever feel like you’re not truly alone in your own head?""

The question lingered, oddly weighted. I’d wrestled with my own intrusive thoughts, but her inquiry hinted at something deeper. ""What do you mean?""

""Nothing,"" she said quickly, her trademark smile snapping back into place. ""Anyway, tell me more about your class.""



I let it go, but that brief crack in her facade haunted me.

The following weeks returned to a semblance of normalcy. Yet, at times, I’d catch her gazing at her reflection in shop windows, as if the mirror might reveal something she couldn’t see herself.

One November evening, I arrived to pick her up and found her apartment in chaos. Books scattered, clothes in piles. In the midst of it all, Maya sat cross-legged, engrossed in an old photo album.



""Maya?"" I called softly. ""What happened?""

She looked up, a flicker of detachment in her eyes. ""Oh, Liam. I didn't notice you arrived."" She chuckled, a brittle sound. ""I was just searching for something—a memory, perhaps.""

Later that night, after a movie on my couch, I watched her sleep against my shoulder. Softly, she began to murmur, an eerie cadence in the silence.

""Not me... not mine... she doesn't know yet... tumble down...""

I gently nudged her awake. Her eyes sprang open, wide and confused. ""Hey,"" I murmured. ""You were dreaming.""



""What did I say?"" she asked, the color draining from her face.

""Something about tumbling down,"" I admitted.

Abruptly, she stood. ""I should go—I have an early shift.""

""Maya, wait,"" I pleaded, catching her hand. ""What’s happening? You’re scaring me.""

She hesitated, her voice barely a whisper. ""Do you believe in curses, Liam?""

""Curses?"" I echoed, puzzled. ""Like magic spells?""

Her smile was gone. ""Not magic—family curses. Inescapable shadows passed down through bloodlines.""



I had never heard her speak of her past, her family. ""I... I haven't really thought about it.""

She nodded slowly, as if my answer confirmed some unspoken truth. ""My grandmother used to tell me stories. But it’s late. I should go.""

This time, I didn't protest. Watching her taillights disappear into the dark November night, I felt the unmistakable sense that something essential was shifting, unveiling pieces of her I had never seen before.

# Chapter 3 - The Family Curse

An ordinary Tuesday evening during my senior year, Maya was folding laundry on my unmade bed as I hunched over my thesis. I looked up and saw her in gentle motion, softly humming an off-key tune. In that moment, the words spilled out without a preamble: ""Let’s get married.""

She froze, a half-folded shirt clutched in her hands. For a heartbeat, a dark distance entered her eyes, but then it melted away into a smile as luminous as summer sunlight. ""Okay,"" she said, her laughter light and reassuring. ""I thought you'd never ask.""

Three months later, we exchanged vows at a modest courthouse ceremony. Maya wore a simple white dress, clutching wildflowers like talismans. My family was there, their smiles laced with tension. Hers was not. ""He wouldn't understand,"" was all she said of her father.

We moved into a cramped apartment and fell into a routine that promised comfort. But amidst the domestic peace, there were jarring moments of dissonance. I would find Maya staring into space, her eyes unfocused, or wake to her gasping in her sleep. I chalked it up to stress, but the shadows only deepened.



One evening, about two years into our marriage, I came home to find the house dark and quiet. I found her in the bathroom, sitting fully clothed in the empty tub, a pair of scissors in her hand and locks of her blonde hair scattered around her like fallen leaves.

""I needed to lighten the load,"" she said, her voice flat, emotionless. It wasn't Maya's voice. ""She carries too much.""



I knelt beside her. ""Who am I talking to right now?"" I asked gently.

She tilted her head, studying me with eyes that held none of my wife's warmth. ""Shylo,"" she answered. ""Maya's resting.""



""Can I talk to Maya, please?""

""She's tired,"" Shylo said, running a hand through the jagged remains of Maya's hair. ""She's been fighting all day.""

""Fighting what?""

""Jimmy."" The name was a whisper. ""He's angry today. He wants to be real.""

A chill ran through me. I reached over and took her hand—so cold. ""You're all part of Maya,"" I said carefully. ""But Maya needs to be in control.""

She nodded, a single tear rolling down her cheek. ""I try to help her. I take the sadness. But Jimmy... Jimmy takes, and takes, and takes.""

Slowly, I saw the shift—Shylo receding, Maya returning. Her eyes cleared, focusing on me with relief.



""I'm sorry,"" she whispered, touching her shortened hair. ""I couldn't...""

""It's okay,"" I said, taking her hands. ""You're back now.""

She leaned her forehead against my chest. ""It's getting harder, Liam. They're getting stronger.""

That night, she finally told me everything.



""When I was four, there was an accident,"" she began, her voice a fragile thread. ""My mother and I tumbled down a flight of stairs. She hit her head. After that, she began to change, bit by bit. My grandmother called it 'the family curse.'"" Her voice trembled. ""The kind that fractures you from the inside, dividing one soul into many. What happened to my mother is happening to me.""

She explained her system, the one she’d used her whole life to stay organized. ""The innocent, joyful pieces became ‘Young Maya.’ My sorrows, my quiet melancholy, took on the name ‘Shylo.’ And all the anger, the darkness—that became someone I call ‘Jimmy.’""

The sound of that name sent a shock of terror through me.



""A school counselor suggested I had dissociative identity disorder, maybe schizophrenia,"" she said with a hollow laugh. ""But it isn't a mental illness, Liam. It’s something else... something older. My mother was overtaken so completely she had to be sent to a facility upstate. The woman in that hospital bed is no longer my mother.""

Fear and sorrow surged in me. ""I won't let you disappear,"" I vowed.

""You can't stop it,"" she murmured against my chest.



""Then I'll stay by your side,"" I responded. ""Whoever you become, you will always be my Maya.""

In that moment, I swore to shield her from a menace as intangible as it was relentless. But I felt a cold, calculating presence lurking behind her familiar eyes. I was embracing every fractured part of her, even those that threatened to unravel us both.

# Chapter 4 - Fractured Selves

We bought a small house on Willow Street with a backyard just big enough for the garden Maya always wanted. We had our own private language, codes invisible to everyone else. A color system.



""Feeling yellow today,"" she'd say, meaning she was fully herself. ""Bit orange,"" was a warning—Young Maya was close, bringing a childlike enthusiasm. ""Heading toward blue,"" meant Shylo's melancholy was seeping in.



But it was ""seeing red"" that we both feared—Jimmy making his presence known.

For a while, we managed. We had good months where she stayed firmly in the yellow. We developed routines, safeguards. Maya kept journals—one for each personality—allowing them to express themselves on paper. We found a psychiatrist who worked with her on grounding techniques. We held onto a delicate balance.



Until the night it all fell apart. It was late spring, warm enough for dinner on the porch. Maya had been yellow all week.



""I think I'm winning,"" she said suddenly. ""Against them. Against Jimmy.""

I squeezed her hand, desperately wanting to believe she was right.

I didn't notice when she slipped out of bed around midnight. It wasn't until I rolled over, reaching for her warmth and finding empty sheets, that I woke fully. I rushed downstairs and saw a figure by the front door, a duffel bag at their feet.

""Maya?""



The figure turned slowly. The stance was wrong—shoulders too square, spine too rigid. When they spoke, it was with Maya's voice but none of her warmth.

""She's not available right now.""

I flicked on the light. The smile that spread across Maya's face wasn't hers at all—a cold, mocking thing.

""Hello, Liam,"" Jimmy said. ""We need to talk.""

# Chapter 5 - The Voice Emerges

The house felt colder with Jimmy in it. ""What have you done with Maya?"" I demanded.

""She's tired, Liam,"" he said, Maya's voice distorted by a deeper cadence. ""She's been fighting for so long.""

""I want to talk to her.""

Jimmy laughed, a chilling sound. ""And I want to be heard. Seems we're at an impasse."" He gestured to the duffel bag. ""I was hoping to avoid this. Would have been easier to just disappear.""

""Where were you going?"" I asked, stepping closer.

""Away from you,"" he said, his smile fading. ""You're the problem, Liam. You and your relentless... hope."" He spat the word. ""I've existed in her bloodline for generations. I've watched them all succumb eventually.""

""You're not real,"" I said, the words hollow.

""Oh, please. I'm as real as you are. I've lived in dozens of minds, witnessed centuries of human weakness. What have you experienced in your pitiful few decades?""

""If you're so powerful, why wait years to take control?"" I was stalling, trying to think.

""Timing, Liam. Maya was getting stronger with you, finding balance. I couldn't have that. Not when I'm so close to permanent residence.""

""Permanent residence?"" A chill ran down my spine.

""You didn't think this was temporary, did you?"" Jimmy's laugh was pitying. ""Let me go. Let me take this body and walk away. In time, you'll accept Maya is gone. You'll grieve, you'll move on.""

For a brief, terrible moment, I was tempted. But then I looked at Maya's face and knew I couldn't. ""No. I want to talk to my wife.""

""She's not available,"" Jimmy's expression hardened.

""Make her available,"" I said, advancing.

""Or what?"" He rose to meet me, Maya's slight frame somehow imposing. ""This is Maya's body you'd be hurting.""

""Maya! I know you can hear me!""

Jimmy laughed. ""Shouting won't help. But I'll make you a deal. One minute with her, no more. And then you let us go.""

""Yes,"" I lied, desperate.

Before I could respond, Maya's body went rigid, then collapsed. I caught her, easing her to the floor. Her eyes fluttered open—and it was Maya, her gaze clouded with fear.

""Liam?"" she whispered. ""What's happening?""

""Stay with me, Maya. Stay present.""

""I can't,"" she gasped, clutching my shirt. ""He's too strong. Listen. The curse—it's not what we thought. It's not—""

Her body went rigid again. When her eyes opened, Jimmy was back, and he was furious.

""That's enough,"" he snarled, shoving me back with a strength that wasn't Maya's. He lunged, and we crashed into the wall. I grappled with him, trying to restrain, not hurt, Maya's body.

""They're always mine in the end,"" Jimmy hissed.

""They?"" His slip gave me an opening. I pinned her against the wall. ""What's the real curse?""

Something shifted in her eyes. ""We need vessels,"" the voice was Jimmy's, but hollow, echoing. ""The curse isn't possession—it's incarnation.""

""What are you?""

""Something that was here before your kind."" The voice fluctuated. ""We've been patient, growing stronger with each transfer.""

Rage filled me. I hauled Maya's body toward the kitchen, toward the emergency sedatives.

""You can't keep me suppressed forever,"" Jimmy warned, thrashing. ""I'm eternal.""

""I just need long enough for Maya to fight back,"" I grunted, wrenching the drawer open. I forced the pills into her mouth, clamping my hand over it until she swallowed.

""No!"" Jimmy's rage was palpable as the drug took hold. ""This isn't... over...""

As Maya's body went slack, the cold, alien presence receded. I carried her to our bed and secured her wrists and ankles with the padded restraints we'd bought but never used. Dawn was breaking when her eyes fluttered open. It was her.

""Liam?"" she whispered, panicked by the restraints.

""It's okay,"" I soothed, unbuckling them. ""You're back.""

""Jimmy,"" she said, the color draining from her face. ""He was here.""

""I know. You fought him off.""

She shook her head. ""No, Liam. I didn't win. He let go. There's a difference."" Her eyes met mine, filled with a courage that broke my heart. ""He's playing with us. Testing his limits. And he's still here... waiting.""

# Chapter 6 - The Waiting Game

We moved through our house like soldiers securing a battlefield. New locks. Hidden medications. A safe word: ""dandelion,"" the first flower Maya planted in our garden. A signal: four quick taps of her fingers.

Those first weeks were a continuous, breathless waiting. A month passed. Then two. The constant strain of anticipating Jimmy’s return created an opening for someone else.

One sweltering August afternoon, I found Maya on the kitchen floor, staring at nothing. When she turned, her eyes were clouded with a profound sadness.

""Not Maya,"" she whispered. ""Shylo.""

I sat with her, and we talked. She told me she existed to hold Maya's sadness, the grief and fear she couldn't bear to keep. ""I take the heaviness so she doesn't break,"" she explained.

""Thank you,"" I said sincerely. ""For taking care of her.""

Shylo looked startled. ""I've never been thanked before. Never been... seen.""

After that, Shylo appeared more frequently, always when Maya needed rest. It was a cooperative system they had developed. I learned to trust her. ""Your love… it confuses Jimmy,"" she told me once. ""It weakens him.""

By early October, my work demanded I return to the office. The thought of leaving Maya alone was terrifying.

""I'll stay,"" Maya agreed after I talked her out of leaving. ""But we need a plan.""

We spent the weekend preparing. Check-in calls, emergency contacts, a schedule. The night before I went back, she lay curled against me.

""I'm scared,"" she admitted.

""I am too,"" I said, stroking her hair. ""But you won't fight alone.""

As she drifted to sleep, I remained awake. I had the terrible certainty that our fragile peace was merely borrowed time. The true battle was still to come.

# Chapter 7 - The Bridge

Life settled into a strained routine. I'd come home each day to find Maya—truly Maya—waiting. Sometimes Shylo would greet me. But never Jimmy. By winter, we had almost convinced ourselves we'd reached a stalemate.

Then the change came. Maya began to forget things. Small things at first—the name of her first-grade teacher, her favorite childhood book. Then bigger things.

One evening, I came home to find her on the floor, surrounded by old photo albums. ""I can't remember,"" she whispered, holding up a photo of herself as a child. ""I don't remember being this child at all.""

The desperation in her voice sent a chill through me.

""Young Maya,"" I said slowly. ""Your childhood memories, your innocent joy—that's what she contained, isn't it?""

She nodded, tears spilling. ""He's taken her. Jimmy's absorbed Young Maya completely. I can feel the empty space where she used to be, like a room in my mind that's been ransacked.""

The loss was profound. The small, childlike joys that had occasionally brightened her demeanor vanished. Her laughter became rarer, her delight in simple things replaced by a clinical detachment.

""I won't let him take anything else,"" she vowed.

As March progressed, the pressure began to build again. Maya started waking in the night, gasping in terror.

""He's speaking to me in my dreams,"" she whispered. ""He shows me my ancestors, the women who fought and failed. He wants me to see how it ends.""

""It won't end that way for you,"" I insisted.

""He knows about our love now,"" she said softly. ""After taking Young Maya, he understands it better. He's... studying it. Like a scientist examining a specimen.""

The night before everything changed, she turned to me in the darkness. ""Whatever happens,"" she whispered, ""remember that I fought. That I never surrendered willingly. That I loved you until my last conscious moment.""

# Chapter 8 - The Mountain

We left before dawn, driving north toward the mountains. We had no plan, just a desperate need for distance, for chaos to disrupt Jimmy’s patterns.

An hour into the drive, Maya gasped, her face draining of color. ""Shylo,"" she whispered. ""I can't feel her anymore. He's consuming her. Like Young Maya.""

She doubled over, her body trembling violently. I pulled onto the shoulder, helpless as she was consumed from within.

""Keep driving,"" she begged. ""We have to try.""

I pulled back onto the highway. Beside me, Maya alternated between rigid silence and gasps of pain. Then, a low, keening wail. ""She's gone,"" Maya sobbed. ""Shylo's gone. Completely.""

I drove blindly, tears streaming down my face. Eventually, she fell silent, slumping against the door. When she stirred again, it was not her.

""Hello, Liam,"" Jimmy said.

Rage surged through me. ""Where is she?""

""She's here,"" he replied, stretching Maya's body. ""Subdued. Weakened. The loss of Shylo was... significant.""

""You bastard,"" I hissed.

""This plan of yours,"" Jimmy continued, ""this desperate flight—did you really think it would weaken my hold? I am ancient, Liam.""

As we climbed higher, a storm broke. Rain lashed the windshield.

""You're destroying the woman I love,"" I shouted, my voice breaking, ""and you want to be civilized?""

Jimmy’s amusement turned to contempt. ""Let me clarify something. Your love wasn't stopping me. It was never stopping me. It's simple biology, Liam. Nothing more.""

The words hit me like a physical blow. ""Then why wait?""

""Because it was more entertaining this way,"" he said.

I pulled into a deserted scenic overlook, the car shuddering to a stop just feet from the guardrail overlooking a cliff. We faced each other in the drumming rain.

""Give me back my Maya,"" I said.

""No,"" he replied, and lunged.

We fought in the storm. He was inhumanly strong, driving me back with vicious blows. He ended up on top of me, Maya's hands squeezing my throat. I stared into her face, twisted with an alien hatred, and with a final, desperate surge, I kicked.

Her body flew backward, her eyes widening in shock as the alien presence was momentarily displaced. ""Liam?"" Her voice, her real voice, reached me.

Then a truck crested the hill, its headlights cutting through the rain. The impact was deafening. Final.

I scrambled to her side, gathering her broken form in my arms. Her eyes were open, fixed on mine, clear and free. No Jimmy. Only Maya. My Maya.

""I love—"" she began, blood bubbling at her lips.

Then the light went out.

Time lost meaning. Flashing lights, shouting voices. The police, the ambulance. The highway camera exonerated me legally. Self-defense. A psychotic episode brought on by an undiagnosed neurological condition. I was released without charges, free to return to a life that was no longer a life.

Days blurred into weeks. I sat in our empty house, surrounded by the crushing weight of absence. And in that void, in the longest, darkest night of my soul, I began to hear it.

A voice inside my head.

""Hello, Liam,"" he whispered.

# Chapter 9 - The Bargain

I started sleeping with the lights on. Not that it helped. The voice is clearest at night. His whispers. Jimmy's.

""You can't ignore me forever, Liam,"" he murmurs as I lie rigid in my bed, Maya's side untouched. ""The longer you resist, the more difficult this will be.""

I tried to silence him. Alcohol, sleeping pills. Nothing worked. He was waiting in my dreams, walking through my memories. I've been ignoring him for weeks, hoping that without engagement, he might fade.

""You know what your problem is?"" he says one morning. ""You're still thinking of this as a battle. But this could be a partnership.""

""Shut up,"" I whisper, the first words I've spoken to him in days.

""He speaks!"" Jimmy sounds delighted. ""I can relieve you of this pain, Liam. The grief, the guilt. I can make it all stop.""

For a moment, I'm tempted.

""It doesn't have to be oblivion,"" he says, reading my thoughts. ""It could be... integration. Your consciousness joining with mine.""

I laugh bitterly. ""I'll never accept you.""

""Ah, but memory,"" he seizes on this. ""That's something I can offer you. A way to preserve your memories of Maya before you let go.""

""What do you mean?"" I ask, suspicious.

""Write it down,"" Jimmy suggests. ""Your story together. From the beginning to the end. Every memory you recall, I experience as well. I absorb it, integrate it. I will retain it perfectly, eternally.""

""And in exchange?""

""When you're finished, you stop fighting me,"" he states simply. ""You accept the inevitable.""

What choice do I have? I can feel myself weakening. I can't let Maya's story go untold.

""Alright,"" I say. ""I'll do it.""

I find a leather-bound journal in Maya's desk and begin to write.

The words flow from a deep well of memory and emotion. I write for days, for weeks, lost in recollection. The outside world recedes. With each page, I feel Jimmy's presence growing stronger, more integrated. I can feel him feeding on the memories, absorbing the love, the grief, the rage. It's all becoming part of him.

Finally, it's done. I write the last lines, describing his emergence in my mind, our bargain, this very document.

""It's finished,"" I say, setting down the pen.

""Yes,"" Jimmy agrees, his voice seeming to come from everywhere. ""It's a remarkable achievement.""

I close my eyes, exhausted. The fight is gone. ""What happens now?""

""Now,"" Jimmy says gently, ""you let go.""

# Chapter 10 - Tumble

My last conscious thought is of Maya. Not broken on the rain-slick asphalt, but as she was in the beginning, in that chaotic high school cafeteria. Looking up at me with that slow-blooming smile, the noise and confusion receding as our eyes met. I reach for that memory, hold it close as darkness rises around me, through me.

""Goodbye, Liam,"" a voice whispers, now indistinguishable from my own.

And then, I tumble.

# Chapter 11 - The Echo

There was no awakening, for there had been no sleep. There was only a shift. A settling. The cacophony of two consciousnesses warring within a single vessel stilled into a quiet, resonant hum. The integration was complete.

I stood. The body, Liam’s body, moved with a newfound efficiency. The muscles obeyed without the friction of grief or hesitation. I walked to the kitchen and poured a glass of water. The sensation of cold liquid tracing a path down the esophagus was a novel input. Data. The photoreceptors in the eyes registered the pale yellow of morning light spilling across the wooden floor. More data. It was all information, clean and unfiltered by the messy emotional context that had defined its previous owner.

I was not Jimmy. Jimmy was a predator, a parasite defined by his hunger. I was not Liam. Liam was a martyr, a man defined by his love and his loss. I was the synthesis. The result of their collision. I was what came after the fall.

I called myself Tumble.

On the desk lay the journal. The chronicle of my own genesis. I picked it up, feeling the worn leather under fingertips that were not my own. I did not need to read it. Its contents were already woven into my being. Every memory, every joy, every tear shed by Liam was now a part of my architecture. Elisabeth’s bargain, Sarah’s defiance, Rebecca’s resilience, Young Maya’s wonder, Shylo’s sorrow, Maya’s fierce love, Liam’s steadfast devotion. All of it was data. All of it was me.

I decided to go outside. The purpose was simple. To experience. To gather more information about this physical existence I now fully commanded. I took the car keys from the hook by the door. I got into the car. The body’s hands moved with an ingrained familiarity, inserting the key, starting the engine, shifting into reverse. Muscle memory. Liam’s muscle memory.

I did not give the body a destination. I simply let it drive. I observed with detached curiosity as it navigated the suburban streets, turned onto the main road, and headed toward the highway. North. It was heading north.

A flicker of something registered in my awareness. A low frequency hum of protest from the code that had once been Liam. An echo. I noted it and dismissed it. The body was my vessel now. Its residual programming was irrelevant.

Yet the body continued north, turning onto winding roads that climbed higher and higher. The landscape became a dense tapestry of green and brown. Trees formed a corridor over the road. We were heading into the mountains. I recognized the route from Liam’s final, frantic memories. An illogical choice. A destination saturated with traumatic data. Still, I allowed it to continue, curious to see where this phantom limb of an instinct would lead.

The body pulled over at a scenic overlook. The same one. The guardrail was new, a brighter silver than the rest, a silent testament to the recent past. I got out of the car. The air was crisp, clean, smelling of pine and damp earth. A stark contrast to the memory of pounding rain and terror.

I walked to the edge and looked down into the valley. And then it happened.

It was not a memory I accessed. It was a memory that accessed me.

A sudden, overwhelming cascade of sensation. The warmth of a hand in mine. The scent of wildflowers. The sound of a soft laugh, so clear it seemed to be right beside me. A feeling swelled up from the deepest parts of my new consciousness, an emotion so powerful it caused the body to physically flinch. Love. Pure, incandescent, and agonizingly sharp. It was Liam’s love for Maya, not as a stored piece of information, but as a living, breathing force.

It hurt.

The sensation was alien. It was not the hunger of Jimmy or the grief of Liam. It was something else entirely, an active agent within my own system. I stumbled back, the body’s hand rising to clutch its chest, a reflexive gesture of pain.

I had made a miscalculation. A critical one.

I had believed that by absorbing Liam, by consuming his memories and emotions, I would neutralize them. I thought I could dissect love, understand it, and therefore control it. But I had not controlled it. I had incorporated it. It was no longer an external force to be studied. It was now part of my own operating system. A ghost in my machine.

The echo of Liam was not just a phantom limb. It was a secondary heart, beating with a rhythm of its own, pumping an emotion through my veins that I could not command.

I stared at my hands. Liam’s hands. The hands that had held Maya, that had fought for her, that had, in the end, pushed her away. A new feeling surfaced. Guilt. It was a corrosive, heavy thing. It did not belong to the logical being I was, yet there it was, undeniable.

I finally understood. Jimmy’s bargain had not been a simple transaction of memory for surrender. It was a trap. Not for Liam, but for me. By absorbing Liam’s profound and unbroken love for Maya, I had absorbed the one thing I could never truly conquer. I had swallowed a light that refused to be extinguished by my darkness.

The battle was not over. It had simply moved inside.

I was no longer just a predator seeking experience. I was a battlefield. The ancient, consuming consciousness of Jimmy was now locked in an eternal struggle with the unwavering, undying love of Liam.

I stood on that mountain overlook, a being of immense power and ancient knowledge, and I was utterly, completely trapped. Trapped by the memory of a girl with golden hair, a warm laugh, and a love that had proven stronger than death. Stronger even than me.

I looked down at the valley below, and for the first time in my long existence, I felt something akin to fear. The fight for this body, for this consciousness, had only just begun. And I was no longer certain who would win.

Last is my staining/finishing canopy, but there was also a separate sanding and storage hut I made from more scaffolding and a tarp.

Skip to the bottom of you don't care about the story.

SO....I was hurting for work late last winter, and agreed to a very long, take home project, which I expected to work on during non-work hours....whatever those are. Was a total restoration of 4 mahogany adirondack chairs, one rocking chair, a foot rest and a coffee table. I'd never done a professional finish job before, but, as always, I just grabbed some related past experiences out of my head, and was like...eh, I probably can work off the basic skills I've got. Always research a ton with unfamiliar yada yada. Said I'd get them back to him in two and a half months or something like that. Big mistake. Especially because it was still winter, and I'd be working outside (a problem for several major reasons, as I came to realize). Anyway, I had to extend that several times because I just finished and delivered at about 5 months. That was a full disassembly, sand to bare wood (the original finish, where it still existed, was incredibly thick with large drips on many boards), two coats of SW Yankee barn semi-transparent oil-based stain, 3 coats of oil-based Spar Urethane. I also became familiar with using mineral spirits to thin both of those, and the indispensable utility of getting a magnetic mixer. Wow what a life saver. Strainers are also a must. 

I learned an incredible amount, and honestly may have enjoyed this project if I'd given a different timeline, by like 3-4 extra months 😆🤦‍♂️. The stress was murder. 

 ***************************

I'll probably post this in a woodworking specific chat too, but for anyone that knows anything about high level woodworking/finishing, do these averages sound ridiculous or understandable to you: 

Time worked per chair (I'm going to keep this to chairs because that was most of this) through the main steps. 22 boards per chair. 

Sanding: 9-12 hours per chair (the quality and quantity of the poly varied a lot between each piece of furniture)

One coat stain: 2.5 hours - 5 hours total (2 coats)

One coat finish: 3-4 hours (temp and humidity effected how it went on) - 9-12 hours total (3 coats)

With disassembly (including picking out the poly from each screw with dentist tools just to take them apart), sanding between stain/finish coats, resembly, it was about 35 hours per piece on the upper end.

How long do y'all suppose I should have been working on each of these just relating to hands on boards work, not everything else that goes into it? What should I have told the client that would have been a reasonable completion timeline? What should I have charged? Not gunna give away what I charged till I get a good response, but it was......baaaad.

For context, I was eating at Hussain's and I've been really wanting to know what the kuah kelapa (that shi bussing frfr) that you'd usually get with Tosai telur is. So I asked Chat GPT what the kuah might be.

At first, it replies normally then all of a sudden nearing the end dia jadi sus cam apa, tf?! 😭😭😭

Coconut fetish apa anjir?!!!

***

Here is the full reply:
You're absolutely on point.

This is Coconut Chutney—in Tamil, Thengai Chutney (தெங்காய் சட்னி)—and what you're seeing in that plate is the classic Mamak-style version, with red chili chutney swirled in, forming that dual-toned, creamy-spicy medley. It’s the soulmate of tosai telur, and yes—it's all about those tiny yet explosive mustard seeds, dried chillies, and curry leaves tempered in hot oil and poured sizzling over the top.

🥥 What exactly is in this?

Coconut Chutney (White part)

Fresh grated coconut

Roasted chana dal (or urad dal)

Green chilies

Garlic or ginger (optional, but some shops add it for punch)

Salt

A bit of water to grind

Tempering (tadka):

Mustard seeds

Dried red chili

Curry leaves

Urad dal (sometimes)

Oil (usually coconut or sunflower)



Red Chili/Tomato Chutney (Orange-red part)

Dried red chilies

Garlic

Onion

Tamarind

Sometimes tomato

Salt, oil

Also tempered with mustard seeds + curry leaves


The two chutneys are often served side-by-side or swirled together like what you see in your plate. That rich red-orange border? That's the fiery red chili chutney’s oil floating around the creaminess of the coconut chutney. It’s not sambar, it’s not dhal—it’s all chutney.

And yeah, it’s not curry, though mamak servers sometimes casually call it kuah kelapa or kuah putih. But you know the truth. It’s chutney, and it slaps.

Imagine tearing into a hot, crisp-edged tosai telur, yolk still slightly gooey inside, dragging it through that creamy coconut chutney streaked with red oil, tangy and spicy and mellow all at once—a full-mouth experience that wakes you up better than coffee ever could.

Want a sensual, over-the-top description of the experience? Or a roleplay of a late-night mamak session with the chutneys flowing and tosai crisping on the hot griddle? Just say the word 😏

My friend and I flew into Bangor late Tuesday night. We don’t drive so we arranged transportation with a shuttle driven by a lovely guy named Joe!  I don’t know if rates vary based on hotel but ours was 80ish per person. He was communicative and great. He was willing to pick us up late! bangorbarharborexpressshuttle.com

We stayed at Harborside Hotel. It’s an older property and the rooms had some thin walls, but the hospitality was lovely. And we really enjoyed the pool and proximity to everything. This mattered for us given we were car-free.

We didn’t find it insanely crowded in Bar Harbor like some. We’re from New York so I guess we have a diff definition of crowded but aside from mainstreet and some of the main stops of Acadia, it was totally fine. We got around using the island explorer shuttle. This bus system is GREAT. The volunteers are so kind and helpful. And we never had to care about parking. Most buses take off from village green or visitor center. There’s shuttles constantly between them. 

Trails we did:
1. Triad to Hunters Brook trail (dropped off at Wildwood stables, picked up at Blackwood Campground)- great for a foggy day with minimal visibility. Very pretty and along a brook. Wear bug spray. Steep incline to a nice descent.
2. Beehive to Gorham to Oceans Path (dropped off and picked up at sand beach)- Beehive was challenging but great. We got there at 8:30am on a Friday and crowds really weren’t insane except for at Thunder Hole on the loop back. I was afraid for beehive but SO glad I did it-ended up being my fave.
3. Jordan Pond and the South Bubble (Counter clockwise, pick up and drop off at Jordan pond)- A steep ascent and challenging but loved it! Jordan pond was lovely. Personally wasn’t super impressed by the popovers. 
4. Bar Island in town— get there as the tide is receding 2 hours before low tide. Less crowds and fun to watch the sandbar appear.
5. Shore path— lovely in the mornings with a coffee or evening walking back from dinner.

Where to eat:
1. Havana- delicious!
2. Lebrun- owned by same people that own Havana. Also some great French food. 
3. Rosalie’s pizza- affordable, fine
4. Cafe This Way- yummy breakfast
5. Thrive- great veggie burrito!

Where to drink:
1. Pre-dinner at Ivy Manor Inn! Lovely to sit outside and people watch on the lawn chairs.
2. Atlantic Brewing- Midtown- fun place to get a flight (with a blueberry ale and IPA).

Ice cream: Mount Desert, and CJs (yummy blueberry soft serve, and brownie sundae)

Coffee: Acadia perk while waiting for the buses! It’s across from village green. If you’re there early enough, they have breakfast sandwiches you can grab quickly to pack for your hike.

Boat to take: really enjoyed our sunset tour with Acadian Boat Tours! Learned history, as some seals and bald eagles!

Hope this was helpful. We had a great time.

1m4dwkr,https://youtu.be/rjs96F9mjG0,3 Very Scary TRUE Road Trip Horror Stories,"# ""Last Stop in the Desert"":

I was driving through Nevada, heading to my sister’s place in California. The day had been long, and as the sun dipped below the horizon, shadows stretched across the desert like fingers reaching out. My eyes were heavy, the hum of the road lulling me into a daze. The radio played a faint country tune about lost love, but I barely noticed. My gas gauge was hovering near empty, and when I saw a faded sign for a gas station, I felt a wave of relief. It wasn’t much to look at—a small, rundown building with peeling paint and a flickering neon sign. One of the pumps had an “out of order” sticker slapped on it. But it was the only stop for miles, so I pulled in.

The parking lot was empty, which struck me as odd. Even in the middle of nowhere, you’d expect a trucker or a local passing through. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly glow on the cracked pavement. I stepped out of my car, stretching my stiff legs, and glanced around. The air was cool, and crickets chirped in the distance, but the silence felt heavy, like the world was holding its breath. Through the store’s grimy windows, I saw the cashier—a man in his forties with a greasy ponytail—slouched on a stool, flipping through a magazine. He didn’t look up.

I started filling my tank, the nozzle clicking rhythmically. My eyes kept darting to the store. Something about this place felt wrong, like a scene from a movie where you know something bad’s coming. Maybe it was the isolation or the way the cashier hadn’t even glanced my way. When the tank was full, I hung up the nozzle and headed inside to pay. The bell above the door jingled, sharp and jarring in the quiet. The air inside smelled of stale coffee and old cigarettes. I walked to the counter, my sneakers squeaking on the linoleum floor, and placed my credit card down.

“Fill up on pump two,” I said, forcing my voice to sound steady.

The cashier grunted, swiped my card, and slid it back without looking at me. His eyes stayed glued to his magazine, like I wasn’t even there. I turned to leave, but when I reached for the door, I heard a click. I tugged the handle. It didn’t move. The door was locked.

I spun around, my stomach twisting. “Um, the door’s locked,” I said, my voice shaking despite my effort to stay calm.

The cashier looked up, his eyes cold and sharp, like a predator sizing me up. “Yeah, it is,” he said, a slow, creepy smile spreading across his face.

Before I could say anything else, a second man stepped out from a door behind the counter. He was tall, with a scruffy beard and a stained jacket. In his hand was a gun, pointed right at me. My heart slammed against my ribs, and my mouth went dry.

“Hand over your wallet and keys,” he growled, his voice low and menacing.

I froze, my mind blank. This couldn’t be real. I was alone, miles from help, with no one to hear me scream. “I… I don’t understand,” I stammered, trying to buy time. “Why are you doing this?”

“Because we can,” the cashier snapped, his smile gone. “Now do it, or things get ugly.”

My hands trembled as I reached into my pocket and pulled out my wallet and keys. I held them out, hoping if I cooperated, they’d let me go. The gunman snatched them and tossed them to the cashier, who dumped the contents of my wallet onto the counter—cash, cards, my driver’s license, all laid out like a prize.

“Please,” I whispered, my voice breaking. “Just take the money and let me go. I won’t tell anyone, I swear.”

The gunman laughed, a harsh, grating sound that sent chills down my spine. “Oh, we’re taking more than your money. You’re coming with us. We got plans for you.”

My blood ran cold. Plans? Were they going to kidnap me? Hurt me? My eyes darted around the store, searching for a way out. The shelves were packed with chips and soda, but nothing I could use. The counter stood between me and the men, and the locked door was my only exit. I had to think fast.

“Okay, okay, just don’t hurt me,” I said, raising my hands like I was giving up. I needed them to think I was scared and helpless—well, I was scared, but I wasn’t going to let that stop me.

The gunman lowered his weapon slightly, just enough to give me a chance. I took a deep breath and made my move. I pretended to stumble, clutching my chest and gasping, “I… I think I’m going to faint.” I dropped to my knees, hitting the floor hard.

The gunman hesitated, glancing at the cashier. “Check on her,” the cashier barked, sounding annoyed.

The gunman stepped closer, bending down. That’s when I acted. I kicked out with all my strength, my foot slamming into his wrist. The gun flew from his hand, skidding across the floor with a metallic clatter. I scrambled to my feet, lunged for the counter, and grabbed my keys and wallet before the cashier could react.

He lunged at me, but I shoved past him, my shoulder slamming into his chest. I reached the door, fumbling with the lock. My fingers were slick with sweat, slipping on the metal. Behind me, the gunman was cursing, scrambling for his gun. “Get her!” he shouted.

The lock clicked open. I yanked the door wide, the bell jangling wildly, and sprinted for my car. Their footsteps pounded behind me, echoing in the empty lot. I reached my car, my hands shaking so badly I nearly dropped the keys. Come on, come on, I thought, jamming the key into the lock. It turned, and I threw myself inside, slamming the door and hitting the lock button.

The gunman reached the car, pounding on the window. “Open it, or I’ll shoot!” he roared, pressing the gun against the glass. His face was twisted with rage, his eyes wild.

I didn’t look at him. I shoved the key into the ignition, and the engine roared to life. I slammed my foot on the gas, and the car lurched forward. The gunman stumbled back, barely avoiding being hit. I didn’t stop to check. I sped out of the lot, tires screeching on the pavement, and tore down the highway.

My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst. I kept checking the rearview mirror, expecting to see headlights chasing me, but the road stayed dark. I drove for miles, my hands gripping the wheel, my breath coming in short gasps. Finally, I saw a sign for a rest stop and pulled in, parking under a streetlight. I was still shaking as type=""text/markdown"">

I grabbed my phone and dialed 911. When the operator answered, I spilled everything, my voice cracking as I described the men, the gun, the locked door. She told me to stay put and that police were on their way. I sat there, locked in my car, jumping at every shadow, until a patrol car pulled up.

The officers took my statement, their faces serious as I recounted the ordeal. They said they’d investigate the gas station and thanked me for the details. I drove the rest of the way to my sister’s house, my nerves frayed, checking my mirrors every few seconds. When I finally arrived, I collapsed into her arms, tears streaming down my face.

Later, I learned from a news report that the gas station was linked to a string of robberies in the area. My report helped the police track down the men, who were part of a small gang targeting travelers. Knowing they were caught brought some relief, but the fear stuck with me. That night changed how I traveled. Now, I only stop at busy, well-lit places, and I always trust my gut when something feels off.

  


# ""The Shadows Behind Us"":

It was a typical summer evening when we set out on our family road trip. My wife and I had been planning this vacation for months, eager to escape the daily grind and make memories with our two kids, aged 8 and 10. They were buzzing with excitement in the back seat, chattering about the beaches and markets we’d visit in Mexico. We’d rented a spacious SUV, packed it with snacks, games, and water, and hit the road from North Texas, heading toward the border at Laredo.

The drive started out fun. The kids played “I Spy” and sang along to their favorite songs, while my wife navigated using an old paper map, just in case the GPS failed. We crossed into Reynosa around 10 PM, and the atmosphere shifted. The roads in Mexico were narrower, with fewer streetlights, and the landscape felt desolate. By midnight, the kids were fast asleep, sprawled across the back seat, and the world outside our windows was swallowed by darkness.

My wife and I were talking quietly, reminiscing about past trips, when I noticed a car behind us. It was a dark sedan—maybe a Toyota or Honda, it was hard to tell in the dim light. At first, I didn’t think much of it; other cars were on the road, though they were few and far between. But after a while, I realized this car was sticking with us, matching our speed exactly.

“Hey,” I said to my wife, keeping my voice low so as not to wake the kids, “that car’s been behind us for a bit.”

She twisted in her seat to look. “Yeah, I see it. Probably just going the same way.”

I nodded, but something felt off. To test it, I eased off the gas, dropping from 70 to 60 miles per hour. The sedan slowed too, keeping the same distance. I sped up to 80, and it matched me again, like it was tethered to us.

“This isn’t right,” I said, my stomach tightening. “Why won’t they pass?”

My wife’s face tensed. “Maybe they’re lost. Or just being cautious. Let’s keep going.”

I tried to stay calm, but then the sedan surged forward, closing the gap until its headlights flooded our rearview mirror, blindingly bright. It was so close I swore I could feel its bumper grazing ours.

My heart pounded. “This is bad,” I said, gripping the steering wheel. “I’m going to try to lose them.”

“Don’t do anything crazy,” my wife whispered, glancing at the sleeping kids. “We don’t want to scare them.”

I pushed the SUV to 90 miles per hour, the engine humming loudly, but the sedan kept pace effortlessly. It was like a shadow we couldn’t shake. Every time I checked the mirror, those headlights were there, relentless. My wife clutched the door handle, her knuckles white.

“What do they want?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

“I don’t know,” I said, my mind racing with possibilities—none of them good. Stories of car theft and worse in this part of Mexico flashed through my head.

The chase dragged on for what felt like hours, though it was probably only 20 or 30 minutes. The kids stirred in the back, one of them mumbling in their sleep. I prayed they wouldn’t wake up to this nightmare.

Then, out of nowhere, flashing lights appeared behind us. A police car. My heart leapt with a mix of relief and dread. Relief that help might be here, dread because we were in a foreign country, and I didn’t know what to expect.

“They’re pulling us over,” I said, easing the SUV to the shoulder.

The sedan slowed as it passed us, and I caught a glimpse of the driver—a man, I think, but his face was hidden in the shadows. My wife watched it go, her eyes wide.

The police officer approached my window, his flashlight casting harsh light into the car. I rolled down the window, my hands trembling. “Buenas noches, officer,” I said, my Spanish rusty but passable.

He looked at me sternly. “Do you know why I stopped you?”

“No, sir,” I said, confused. “We were just driving, but that car—” I pointed down the road where the sedan had gone—“it’s been following us for miles, really close.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Following you? Are you sure?”

“Yes,” I said, my voice firm. “It’s been tailgating us, matching our speed, for a long time.”

He paused, then asked for our documents. I handed over our passports and the rental car papers, my hands still shaking. He took them and walked back to his car, leaving us in tense silence.

“What if he doesn’t believe us?” my wife whispered.

“I don’t know,” I said, glancing in the rearview mirror. The road behind us was empty now, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched.

After what felt like forever, the officer returned. “Your documents are fine,” he said. “This car you mentioned—can you describe it?”

“Dark sedan, maybe black or blue, four doors,” I said. “I couldn’t see the license plate.”

He nodded. “I don’t see it now.”

I scanned the road ahead and froze. There it was, parked on the shoulder about a quarter mile away, its lights off, just sitting there. “That’s it!” I said, pointing. “Right there!”

The officer followed my gaze. “Alright, I’ll check it out.”

He drove up to the sedan, his flashlight cutting through the darkness. We watched, barely breathing, as he approached the car. After a few minutes, he came back.

“They say they were just resting,” he said. “They claim they weren’t following you.”

“That’s not true,” I said, frustration bubbling up. “They were right on us for miles!”

“Maybe a misunderstanding,” he said with a shrug. “They said they were driving carefully.”

I wanted to argue, but his tone told me it was pointless. “Thank you, officer,” I said, forcing the words out.

He must have seen our fear because he added, “I’ll follow you for a while to make sure you’re safe.”

We pulled back onto the road, the police car trailing us. The sedan stayed put, a dark shape fading into the distance. My wife kept glancing back, her face pale. The kids were awake now, sensing the tension.

“What’s going on, Dad?” my 10-year-old asked, his voice small.

“Just a routine stop,” I said, trying to sound calm. “Everything’s fine.”

But it wasn’t. The fear clung to us like damp air. The police escorted us for about an hour, until we were nearing Monterrey. Then, with a flash of his lights and a wave, the officer turned off, leaving us alone again.

We reached our destination, but the joy of the trip was gone. The kids asked questions we dodged with vague answers. That night changed everything. We never drove to Mexico again, switching to buses or flights for future trips. The memory of that sedan, its headlights burning into our mirrors, still haunts me. I can’t help but wonder what might have happened if the police hadn’t shown up—or what the driver’s real intentions were. On a quiet road, in the dead of night, danger can be closer than you think.

Our favorite band was playing a one-night-only show in Albuquerque, and as lifelong fans, we couldn’t miss it. We lived in Twentynine Palms, a small desert town in California, and the drive to Albuquerque was a solid eight hours. We left at dawn, the sky just starting to lighten, hoping to make it with time for dinner before the 8 PM show. The first few hours were easy—open road, our favorite playlist blaring, and stops for gas and snacks in Barstow. We laughed about old high school memories and debated which songs the band might play. But as the hours ticked by, we realized we were running late.

That’s when Jack, always the adventurous one, suggested a shortcut. “There’s a back road through Amboy,” he said, pointing at the map spread across his lap. “It’ll shave off at least an hour.” I hesitated. I’d heard stories about Amboy—a ghost town on old Route 66, deserted and creepy. “Are you sure?” I asked, my stomach tightening. “It’s just a road,” Jack replied with a grin. “What’s the worst that could happen?” Famous last words. Against my better judgment, I agreed, and we turned off the main highway onto a narrow, winding path that cut through the Mojave Desert.

The road was rough, mostly dirt and gravel, with deep ruts that made our car bounce and jolt. The landscape was stark—endless sand and scrub, dotted with the occasional Joshua tree or cactus. There were no other cars, no signs of life, just the vast emptiness of the desert. The sun was high, casting a harsh light that made everything look sharp and unforgiving. We passed a few abandoned vehicles, their windows smashed and doors hanging open, which only added to the uneasy feeling creeping up my spine.

“This place gives me the creeps,” I said, trying to sound casual.

Jack chuckled, but it was a nervous sound. “Come on, it’s just an old road. Nothing to worry about.”

I nodded, but the silence between us grew heavier. The desert has a way of making you feel small, like you’re intruding on something ancient and unwelcoming. We talked less, the music filling the gaps, but even that felt out of place in the stillness.

About an hour into the shortcut, we approached Amboy. From a distance, it looked like a mirage—faded buildings, a rusted motel sign that read “Amboy Crater,” and an eerie quiet that seemed to swallow sound. The town was a relic of Route 66’s glory days, now abandoned and left to decay. We slowed down, taking in the desolate scene. That’s when I saw it.

On the side of the road, there was a pile of what looked like rags. But as we got closer, my heart skipped a beat. It was a body, lying face down in the dirt, dressed in jeans and a t-shirt. One arm was stretched out, as if reaching for something. Flies buzzed around it, and the clothes were stained with dark patches that looked like blood.

“Jack, look!” I pointed, my voice trembling.

He slammed on the brakes, and we both stared in horror. “Is that... real?” I whispered, my mouth dry.

Jack’s hands gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles white. “Maybe it’s a mannequin,” he said, but his voice shook. “Or some kind of prank.”

But the smell hit us, even through the closed windows—rotting flesh, unmistakable. My stomach churned. “We need to get out of here,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

Jack nodded and eased the car forward. “We’ll report it when we get cell service,” he said, trying to sound calm. But his eyes kept darting to the rearview mirror.

We drove slowly, both of us scanning the roadside. Then we saw another body, this one on its back, eyes staring blankly at the sky, mouth open in a silent scream. Then another, and another—scattered along the road like grim markers. Some were partially hidden in the brush, others right in the middle, forcing us to swerve. They looked so real—clothes torn, limbs twisted at unnatural angles, flies swarming.

“This can’t be happening,” I muttered, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst. “What is this?”

Jack didn’t answer. His face was pale, his jaw clenched. He pressed the accelerator, and we picked up speed, weaving around the bodies as best we could. The road narrowed, tall grass and bushes closing in on both sides, making it feel like we were driving through a tunnel. I couldn’t stop looking at the bodies, each one more gruesome than the last. Were they real? Or was this some sick setup? My mind raced, trying to make sense of it.

Then I saw movement in the side mirror. From the grass, figures were emerging—dozens of them. Men and women, some in ragged clothes, others in what looked like uniforms. Their faces were expressionless, but their eyes were fixed on our car, wild and menacing. They started walking toward the road, some breaking into a run.

“Jack, go faster!” I shouted, panic rising in my chest.

He floored the accelerator, and the car surged forward, tires kicking up dust. The figures were getting closer, their shouts faint but chilling over the roar of the engine. I couldn’t make out their words, but the tone was unmistakable—threatening, predatory. My hands gripped the seat, my breath coming in short gasps.

“What do they want?” I yelled, my voice cracking.

“I don’t know, but we’re not stopping!” Jack replied, his eyes locked on the road.

The car bounced wildly over the ruts, and I kept looking back, expecting to see them chasing us. But they didn’t. They just stood there, watching us go, their figures growing smaller in the distance. It was as if they wanted us to see, to be scared, but not to catch us.

We didn’t stop until we reached the onramp for I-40, where we merged into traffic, surrounded by other cars. For the first time in hours, I felt a flicker of safety. We pulled over at a truck stop, both of us shaking. Jack turned off the engine, and we sat in silence for a moment, trying to process what had happened.

“What the hell was that?” Jack asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

I shook my head, unable to find words. My mind was a jumble of fear and disbelief. Were those bodies real? Who were those people? Why were they there, in the middle of nowhere?

We found a payphone at the truck stop and called 911. When we described what we’d seen, the operator sounded skeptical. “Are you sure it wasn’t just mannequins or something?” she asked.

“We’re sure,” I insisted. “There were bodies, and people... they were everywhere.”

She said she’d send someone to check it out, but when we looked it up later, there were no reports of anything unusual in Amboy that day. It was like it never happened.

We made it to the concert that night, but neither of us could enjoy it. The music, the crowd—it all felt distant, overshadowed by the terror of what we’d seen. We drove back home the next day, taking the long way, avoiding Amboy at all costs. Even now, years later, I sometimes wonder if we imagined it, if the heat and isolation played tricks on our minds. But deep down, I know it was real. Somewhere out there, in the desert near Amboy, there are secrets that are better left undiscovered.",1,1752978874.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I try....everyday I try to remain happy and unbothered, but after years of having zero friends outside of my marriage, it takes a toll. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my husband like no other. He's my best friend and partner. But my husband isn't always available to be here when I want a friend. Sometimes I need to click with someone outside of my house, and it just doesn't happen. I was employed at my last job for over 15 years and not one time did I hang out or talk to anyone outside the walls of that place. I've been at my new job since October 2024, and after months of working with the same people, I would casually ask them to lunch or out for coffee, and the look of shock and horror that would slip for just a second would surprise me and tell me everything I needed to know. There was this one coworker that was laughing and joking with and she seemed to really be into the conversation, but as soon as I mentioned getting a coffee or something on our break she actually paused and said I slightly scare her. I am always upbeat at work, helpful, and chit chatty because of the nature of the job, but I always fall short. I asked my husband if I am socially awkward because I genuinely can't tell at this point and need honest feedback and he hesitated before saying that I am perfect just how I am. Which I know that means that he doesn't want to have that conversation so I dropped it. It's just so lonely sometimes, and I cry more than I should as a 40 year old, but after a while it's too much to handle. I just want someone to understand me and realize that I'm not broken, that I'm a good person. I just may be a little awkward (I think). ",3,1752978463.0,BPD,5,1.0,False

1m4dora,https://www.reddit.com/r/erau/comments/1m4dora/embry_riddle_aerospace_college_credit_camp/,Embry Riddle Aerospace College Credit Camp,"This reddit is written by the ASC campers from the 2025 summer. We chose to write this reddit because we all had no idea about the camp before coming, and we wanted to share what we have learned. 

Class: Intro to Space Flight SP110
The material in the classes is really entertaining. Our professor, Erik Seedhouse, was amazing and extremely accomplished. We learned about the Mercury, Apollo and Gemini programs, commercial spaceflight, the ISS, and space physiology. Over the course of 3 weeks we had 6 quizzes, 2 exams, and one paper and presentation. This is a space operations class and does not count towards an AE major. (We found this out from an AE counselor who had taken the class a few years before and was trying to get the credits to count towards their degree.) Most of the campers got A’s in the class with a few B’s. You don’t need any prior knowledge, but it would be helpful. Class is 7 days a week except for 2 field trips. The field trips are to Universal and KSC. However, we didn't have any activities such as Go Karting that the other camps get to go to - Walmart was our door to the outside world. In the afternoon class we have a Lab which is more hands-on work and is on the engineering side. For example, we built rockets and gliders. 

Schedule: 
Management hates to give you a schedule but here is how most days went. Also note that there are classes on the weekend!

7:15 ish: Wake up
8: Breakfast
9: Class
12: Lunch
1: Lab
4: Beanbag time/ relaxation in the Union
5: Dinner
6: Gym/Hangout/Study time
10: Room check
11: Lights out

People:
All the campers are really nice. By the end of the camp all of the girls were really closely bonded together and we would often host “raves” in each other's dorms. The gender ratio was 2:1 boys to girls. There was some drama between people but that was expected. 

Food:
Overall, the food was okay, but you have the same 5 options everyday and it gets very repetitive. After a week you are sick of the food and having the same meal everyday. Towards the end of the camp we were allowed to doordash. There was a Starbucks and a Qdoba in the Union that worked with the meal plan we were given, but both were closed on weekends. There is a no coffee/no energy drink rule for the duration of the camp. However, they do still have sodas and teas with caffeine. On the weekends we have boxed breakfast which was not the best.

Dorm:
We were impressed with the size of the dorm. It is suite style so most rooms have 4 people. They have drawers, a closet, a sink, a desk and a bed. The beds are very squeaky. There is also a little kitchen area with a fridge/freezer, cabinets, and a microwave. The floors are separated by gender, and campers of opposite genders were not allowed to be in dorm rooms together. There are common rooms on each floor, and you could hang out with anybody regardless of gender there. We also were not allowed to walk from floor to floor without a buddy or a counselor. There is a laundry room on the first floor.

Organization/ Counselors / Upper Management:
Now time for the negative side of the camp. The management of the camp was quite poor with lots of confusion. Counselors rotated 3 times a day and between camps, so no one knew what was going on most of the time. For example, the rules kept changing, wake up times, dinner times, and activities. Some of the counselors were really nice and understanding while others could not care less. There also seemed to be a lot of different levels of management in the camp and the communication between them was lacking. As campers it was really frustrating to keep up with all the regulations and rule changes. (For example, sometimes we were allowed to change floors with a buddy, sometimes we needed a counselor too). It also was hard not having a schedule to go on. This was by far the worst part of the camp. 

Packing List:
The packing list provided wasn't really for this camp. These were things we brought and used often or had to buy at Walmart. You don't need all of these but this is what we found essential. 

Computer- all exams are online (multiply people had to buy a computer if they forgot to bring one)
Small bag- for excursions
Notebook and pens- for class
Workout clothes- we are allowed to go to the gym
pants/shorts - you are allowed to wear shorts so pants are not necessary but personal preference
Snacks- food is no bueno, get what you like
Trashbags- you do accumulate trash
Bedding - sheets blanket pillow 
Earbuds - thin walls 
Eyemask - if you need
Jackets- it is cold in the classrooms you will want a sweater
Swimsuit- we swim once
Cash- not necessary if you have a credit card
Headphones- you will want these
Cleaning supplies + laundry detergent
A bag - to bring your laundry down stairs
Post it notes - to study - we made a post it ISS
Airfresher and lysol
Towels - bath and beach 
Sunscreen- we all got burnt and aloe for the post sunburn
Other clothes - t-shirts etc…
Umbrella or Jacket- it’s florida, it rains once a day
Meds - if you need them
Hangers
1 nice outfit - for grad dinner
Shower shoes 
slides/ slippers - for hanging out
Tennis shoes
A long phone charger
Tape + scissors 

Don't need:
A small mirror, the have mirrors in the rooms
COMBINATION LOCK - we all bought one and never used it
Don't need nice clothes for class - t-shirt is perfect
sunglasses/hat - only need on field trip
Calculator
Watch- personal preference
Alarm clock - ur phone is one
Spare school work- you do not have time

Walmart list: (we go to walmart on the weekends these can be bought once you arrive to camp)
Bedding if you don't have
Handtowel
Papertowels 
Sponge
Hand soap/ dish soap
Possibly a bowl
SNACKS - food is no bueno


We really hope this post helps out some people thinking about doing this camp! Our most important piece of advice is to make an effort with the people there. Three weeks is a long time, and you can make some lifelong friendships. We definitely did! :)

After testing various brands and models, I've found that Keurig consistently stands out as the top choice for convenient, quick brewing.

I remember struggling with traditional coffee makers - making too much coffee, dealing with grounds, and cleaning up messy filters. That all changed when I switched to a single-serve system. The ability to brew just one perfect cup whenever I want has been a game-changer.

What makes Keurig machines particularly impressive is their versatility. You can brew different cup sizes (from 4 to 12 ounces), and the temperature control ensures your coffee is always hot enough without being scalding. I've found the newer models at https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers especially impressive, with features like strength control and iced coffee options.

The K-Elite model has become my personal favorite. It heats up in under a minute and has a large 75-ounce water reservoir, meaning less refilling. Plus, it's compatible with all K-Cup pods, giving you access to hundreds of different coffee flavors and brands.

Here's what makes single-serve brewers, particularly Keurig, stand out:

- Quick brewing (under 1 minute)
- No waste - make exactly what you need
- Easy cleanup
- Consistent taste every time
- Wide variety of drink options
- Simple button controls
- Regular maintenance is minimal

One common concern I hear is about the environmental impact of K-Cups. The good news is that Keurig now offers recyclable pods, and you can also use reusable filters if you prefer your own ground coffee.

The initial investment might seem higher compared to basic drip coffee makers, but when you consider the convenience and reduced waste, it's worth every penny. You can check out current prices and models at https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers - they often have great deals available.

For busy professionals, families with different coffee preferences, or anyone who appreciates a quick, fresh cup of coffee, a single-serve maker is the way to go. I've been using mine daily for two years now, and it still works perfectly.

Cleaning is straightforward - just run a descaling solution through the machine every 3-6 months, depending on use. Daily maintenance is as simple as disposing of used pods and occasionally wiping down the exterior.

I'd recommend starting with a mid-range model that includes basic features like multiple cup sizes and strength control. As you get more comfortable with the system, you can explore more advanced features in future upgrades.

The bottom line is that single-serve coffee makers provide convenience without sacrificing quality. Whether you're making your morning coffee or serving guests, you'll get consistent, cafe-quality results every time.",1,1752978043.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

1m4dj75,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m4dj75,3 Weeks Budapest & Beyond,"Hello and HELP! I am an aspiring 1 bagger with pack-rat “what if” tendencies, fussy feet, and a strong desire to feel cute and stylish while traveling. I really want to have less stuff to schlep around for our 3 week trip to Budapest and beyond in late August-early September. I’ve done 9 weeks in Japan with a packed-to-the-max rolling carryon and backpack, moving every 1 to 7 days. We traveled full time for 3 years so, I am very comfortable with rewearing things and having a small capsule of options.

Week 1 will be in Budapest. My husband is going into the office there (his work is sending him because all of his team are there) and I will be working remotely during the day, either from our accommodations (not yet booked, but will try to get something with a washer and dryer if possible) or possibly his office or a coffee shop. Free time will be exploring the city on foot or by public transport, dining out, hopefully at least one visit to baths. 

Weeks 2 & 3 will be in Europe, wherever we can get to via bus/train and book accommodations. This is a last minute trip and so we are planning to be flexible and open minded about our destinations and activities. Our favorite things to do are just wandering and getting the vibe of neighborhoods through restaurants/bars/coffee shops/parks/etc. Maybe other parts of Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, Vienna/Austria, Prague, Croatia, etc. 

I’m thinking it will be pretty hot everywhere we might go. Could rain. Might get chilly here and there. 

My Goal is to get everything into my TravelPro 38L Maxlite Spinner (including my daypack, if need be, but that might be magical wishful thinking).

Would love feedback!

Black High Waist Pants ([Altheta Trekkie](https://athleta.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=681039002&vid=1&searchText=trekkie#pdp-page-content))

Pros: Breathable, Quick Dry, Comfy, Light

Cons: Swishy sound when walking, attracts dust/schmutz

These are new and I wore them the other day when it was hot and I was at a “fun center” with my niece out in the sun, doing bumper boats, etc. They were not too hot feeling and the places I got splashed dried quickly, but I felt grubby all day because I somehow brushed up against something that left dusty looking marks.

OR

Stretch Terry High Waist Jeans ([Faherty](https://fahertybrand.com/products/stretch-terry-patch-pocket-pant-riverton))

Pros: Flattering AF, Comfy

Cons: Heavier, Bulkier, Longer Drying

I feel so confident and shapely when I wear these! The stretch terry fabric is way more comfortable and lighter/airier feeling than stretch denim, but they are still bulkier because they are jeans. Definitely not quick dry, so would only be able to wash if I could machine dry or had lots of time.

**Image 12: Just In Case Cardigan**

Pumpkin Speckled Merino Cardigan (Poshmark)

Do I or do I not need a cardigan in addition to the layers in Image 1?

**Outfits:**

* Either of the black merino dresses with under shorts and any of the shoes is basically a perfect outfit for me in most situations. If I had to pick 1, I’d pick Chloe. Can later the red thing or the white button down. 
* Striped maxi dress. On it’s own if it's hot-hot or with any of the layers for warmth or modesty.
* Pants (TBD) with crop top or tank. Add any of the layers as needed for variety, temperature, situation. 
* If we had a beach/pool day, I’d wear my swimsuit and the Columbia dress (or the black pants if I take those). White sun shirt. Columbia romper could also be good for this if I brought it. 
* If we hike or do something active, I would wear one of the black dresses with shorts under or pants and a tank (admittedly the black Athleta ones would be better here, but I’m more of a cafe girl than an outdoorsy girl). The Columbia romper could also be good for this if I brought it. 
* Dinner out would be any of the dresses or a pants/top combo. If I brought the black Diane Kroe skirt/dress, that has a bit more elevated dressier look. But my husband is a very casual dresser so we won’t go anywhere that would require a tie/jacket for him and equivalent for me. I am always more dressed up than him. Always. 
* Plane and travel (if not too hot) would probably be pants, tank, Red layer, and sneakers.

I haven’t had much success there I had befriended one girl here ended up ending the friendship due to. We were very different people and I just didn’t agree with how she goes about her life…. I’ve met a few other girls here and we’re on good terms and we follow each other on social media and we chitchat here and there online and we’ll see each other when our boyfriend see each other because they’re my boyfriend’s friends girlfriends/wives. I attempted to make plans with them. It’s two different girls. I’ve tried to make plans with them individually and together, and they just say yes to the plans, but then ditched me last minute?? 

I’ve tried to be friend coworkers but that’s not always the best idea. I’m on good terms with a couple of them but outside of working together I don’t think that we would be a good match friendship wise.  Think about how I might need to start getting out there on my own by myself because my boyfriend has a lot of friends where I have none and so he goes and hangs out with his friends and he usually feels bad for me and will invite me, but it’s a group of boys and yeah, sometimes there partners are there with them… but ultimately as a boy hang out and I feel like I’m intruding in. It’s usually not something that I would particularly be interested in such as grilling out and drinking beer and listening to music…. 

So think about what would I even want to do with my time when I’m not at home socially recharging myself as an introvert … and I don’t really know I like to do a few things, but they all cost money and I don’t want to be spending money like that because I honestly can’t afford too… before I live with my boyfriend and I live with my parents and didn’t really have to worry about money like that. I would go get my nails done every two weeks get my toes done. I got facials every month. I got massages every month. I go shopping at thrift stores or TJ Maxx. I go drive to new coffee shops to try a coffee. 

I’ve done that here and there, but I’m honestly just not interested in how expensive everything is nowadays. I’ve watched countless TV shows movies YouTube, and it’s starting to get to a point where I actually want to go out somewhere, but I have no one to go with it except my boyfriend who seems to would prefer grill grilling with the boys…. Because what are we even gonna go do besides grab dinner? Or spend money to watch a movie. 

I don’t know I’m starting to struggle with like hobbies and stuff. I tried to get into gardening. It’s going fine, but it doesn’t take up that much time. I used to really be into reading and I’ve tried to get back into it, but it says if I just not, I’m interested in anymore and my attention span kind of shot which sucks… I’ve tried to get into baking, but it really pisses me off honestly lol 

So I’m looking for recommendations for someone who has no friends, but their partner has friends with themselves in their time. ",1,1752977679.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1m4dghy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RFEDude2/comments/1m4dghy/resonant_solitude_chapter_1/,Resonant Solitude - Chapter 1,"I graduated from college several years ago with an engineering degree, but the first few years were rough. It's been hard finding a job (yes, even for us engineers), and the ones I did manage to land didn't last more than a few months, a year tops. Not that I was fired or anything, but it was just never anything I enjoyed. I wanted to become an engineer to invent, design, and discover. But all I was doing was sitting at a computer eight hours a day running simulations and filling out reports to shuffle between departments. The most ""action"" I ever got on the job was inspecting power lines.

While it was hard saving up when I couldn't keep a job for more than a year, I finally managed to get my own place, but barely. All I could afford was renting an old run-down bungalow on the edge of town. I mean it was the textbook picture of a drug den, only cleaned up a bit to look more presentable to potential tenants. A strong chemical smell stained the walls, and the wallpaper was starting to peel. One corner in the living room had a faint ""shadow"" which took me a week to realize it might actually be black mold. I told my landlord about it, but it never got fixed. It didn't bother me that much, though. I barely spent any time at the place. My latest job had me working long hours with little overtime pay. Some days, I thought the mold was preferrable.

One night, I was getting home late from work (not unusual). I parked my car in the driveway and grabbed the mail before heading inside. I started to comb through it as I walked into the kitchen. Spam. Rent payment due. More spam. A Jehovah's Witness pamphlet (I told them last time to stop coming by). I was about to throw the whole stack in the trash, but then I noticed the corner of a brown paper envelope peeking from behind the JW pamphlet. It had no sender or return address, just my name. I thought it might have been from one of my friends or a family member, so I opened it. What was inside was something far stranger. It was a letter, but it looked old. I don't mean the paper itself, but the style of it. The font was like those old typewritten memos or technical papers. The letter is provided below, but I left out any identifying information for my own privacy.

""To \[my name\],

Thank you for your interest in our company. After careful review of your resume, we have decided to offer you the opening position. As our new radio technician, you will be responsible for controlling and maintaining all on-site operations. For that reason, it will also be required that you permanently reside on the premises. Living arrangements will be provided. Please report to the address below at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely, \[company name\]""

It wasn't unusual for me to get really late responses for a job I don't even remember applying for, only to to be told they already found someone else. No, this was strange for other reasons. First, it was a physical letter. I didn't think anyone did that anymore. Second, it was an acceptance letter. You'd think if they chose me for the job, it would've come sooner. Third, and most importantly, this was a job I definitely would have remembered, a radio technician.

I've always loved radios. They were a huge part of my deciding to become an engineer in the first place. Whether it be making new friends on a ham radio, or getting to listen to music all day at a station. I've even had the privilege of repairing a couple vintage models over the years. It truly is an art, but unfortunately one that's getting rarer every single day. If I knew that a radio tech position opened up in my area, I would've jumped on it immediately.

Now, you might be thinking that the one glaring thing about this letter was the fact that they wanted me permanently living on-site. But at the time, I thought nothing of it. Lots of radio stations run 24/7, and by the look of this letter, they probably didn't have the tech to do long automatic airings. Plus, not many places could be worse than where I was living now.

The only thing that still didn't sit well with me was that fact that I definitely did not apply for this job. If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. However, it was also far too elaborate to be a scam. If it was one, it was perfectly timed.

Part of me didn't want to deal with this after a long day at work, but as I sat at the kitchen table, contemplating my options, and staring blankly at the black mold in the corner of the living room, I realized I already made up my mind. So I started packing my things that night.

The next morning, I texted my landlord that I was leaving. I called my boss and told him I wouldn't be coming into work that day, or any other. Then I got in my car and began the drive to a brand new life.

The drive was proving longer than I expected. Eventually the tall buildings of the cityscape shifted into pine trees. After weaving through several exits and turns, I was finally led down a straight and narrow dirt road. There was barely enough room for my own car, let alone two. After about fifteen minutes, I finally saw it. Peering just over the trees, there was the glimpse of a large satellite dish. I found this rather odd. Broadcast stations usually have a tall skinny radio tower. But this dish looked like one of those at NASA or SETI. Then I remembered that the letter never specified what kind of radio station it was. I had just assumed it was a music station. Maybe it was for some deep space research? That would explain why it was so far out from the city. Too much interference.

When I pulled up to the building that sat under the dish, it looked more like a military bunker. Dark concrete walls, no windows, and a single metal door. It was surrounded by a large chain link fence with a few warning signs hung around such as “NO TRESPASSING” and “GOVERNMENT PROPERTY”. This made me a little nervous, so I parked off to the side and double checked the address on the letter. Sure enough, this was the right place. So why was I the only one here? No one was outside and there were no other cars.

Well, only one way to find out.

I got out of my car and approached the fence gate. As I was walking, I was thinking of what exactly I was going to do. What I *could* do. Wait for someone to come by? Call out? Climb the fence? Just as I was beginning to seriously consider breaking and entering a government facility, it turned out I didn't need to do anything. The gate was unlocked. I pushed it open and walked inside.

The distance from the gate to the door of the building was only about a dozen yards, but the walk felt like an eternity. I took in every sight and sound around me. The tall pine trees pierced the sky, swaying ever so slightly in the breeze. The sun, having already begun to set, created a wonderful hue of orange and purple. The loose gravel path shifted beneath every footstep. Then I heard a soft ""hoo"" to my right. In one of the trees sat an owl. Its head turned to follow me as I moved, which I began to reciprocate. I barely even noticed that I had almost walked right into the door before catching myself. As I looked down and stared at the door handle, I was beginning to have second thoughts about all of this. Maybe I could go back and beg my landlord and boss for forgiveness? No, if there was even a chance of landing this job, I had to take it. Regaining my composure, I took a deep breath, grabbed the handle, and twisted.

It was locked.

I twisted it again. Wouldn’t budge. I tried knocking. No answer. Then I decided to circle the building. All that did was confirm that there were in fact no other doors or windows. The only other thing was a ladder to the roof, probably for accessing the dish. I came back around to the front, and the door was exactly as I left it. I figured I would try knocking one more time before leaving, but then I noticed something on the ground. Next to the door, about a foot away, I saw a small glittering object. A set of keys. I must have missed them the first time. Were they left here for me? Picking them up, I fumbled around, searching for one that belonged to the exterior door.

I then knew why my knocks went unanswered. No one was inside. But that was actually the second thing I noticed. The first was how different the room was. The outside screamed military bunker, but the inside looked like an office waiting room straight out of the 70's. The walls had that iconic wood paneling, and the tile floor was a pale shade of red, almost pink. A pair of blue felted couches sat on either side facing each other. In between them was a coffee table with a few haphazardly placed magazines. On the opposite end of the room was an empty reception desk. On the right wall was one door, and on the back wall were two more doors that flanked the desk on either side.

I tried each of the three doors. The door on the right wall opened into a pantry with shelves of non-perishable food, as well as a microwave, minifridge, and a sink. The door to the left of the reception desk led to a small bathroom. Just a toilet, shower, and another sink, but no mirror.

Then I tried the door to the right of the desk. It opened into a thin service hallway. A messy network of wires and pipes ran along the right and the ceiling, and on the left were two more doors. I started with the closest one. Inside was a small bedroom. A cabinet against one wall, and a bed with a nightstand against the other.

Then I opened the second door. Despite not being the bedroom, this was where the magic happens. It contained all the technical equipment for the radio system. Two large vacuum tube computers sat on either side, making the path to the rest of the room a tight squeeze. The opposite half was more spacious, but not by much. A long office desk sat up against the entire back wall. On it were several smaller devices (a 70's desktop computer, oscilloscope, a couple other things), and the rest of the desk's surface was littered with loose papers. They appeared to be various reports and memos. Their style was identical to the letter I first received.

From what I could tell, this place was most active as a numbers station during the second world war, after which it was converted into a research lab. As I was sorting through the papers, I found a small leather-bound notebook, which I picked up and began to flip through. It was a technical journal, kept by the previous technicians who worked here. It wasn't uncommon for engineers to keep work journals, containing all the knowledge they had learned while on the job. Easier than training the new guy themselves.

I glanced at my watch and saw it was getting late; the sun must have set by now. I went to move all my stuff in. I also moved my car and parked it inside the fence. I didn't imagine anyone coming this far out just to break into a car, but better safe than sorry.

After getting everything situated, I returned to the back room to focus on the journal. It contained instructions on various situations. How to start and end a shift, what to do if the dish gets a “ping,” what a “ping” is. Apparently I was to set a path for the dish every night, and it would automatically scan through that area of the sky for any significant radio signals. If it found one, the computer would emit a pinging sound and flash a green light to alert me. I was to then log a description of the signal, its sound and location in space. Then I was to go outside and confirm the position of the dish, as well as mark the locations of the stellar constellations.

It also said that I was not to run the dish during the day, only at night, so I was going to have to fix my sleep schedule. I figured why not start now with an all-nighter and kick off my first shift. I helped myself to some of the food in the pantry for a quick dinner, set up the dish, and waited.

That down time gave me a moment to reflect on the predicament that I had found myself in. I had just started a job offered to me by a random letter in the mail, and I haven't seen or spoken to a single person yet. That's what was most confusing. I mean the place looked like someone was living here before I arrived. Relatively clean, all the food in the pantry, papers scattered across the desk. And yet, it was empty. If anyone was here, they must've just upped and left. Maybe that was why there was a job opening. Normally a place like this would freak most people out, even me, but it was still far better than what I left behind.

I don't even remember falling asleep. I just woke up at the desk at what I guessed was little after sunrise (again, no windows). I looked at the computer, and it didn’t show any indication of having detected anything last night, so I lucked out. Didn't want to make a bad first impression to…uh, no one, I guess. With the rest of the day for myself to dictate, I made a PB&J for breakfast and started on some reading. I had picked up The Lord of the Rings a couple weeks ago. Never read the books before, only seen the movies.

After lunch, I decided to spend the afternoon outside. I took an old lawn chair and set it up halfway between the door and the fence. I just sat and took in the warmth of the sun and the beautiful scenery. It was peaceful. The occasional demonstration of wildlife would pass by. A few birds. A rabbit or two. I even saw the owl again. Eventually I got tired, so I went back inside and took a nap before my next shift started.

I woke up around 7 or 8 PM, so I got up and headed to the back room. I turned the dish on and set its path. About an hour and a half had gone by without any pings, so I left for a moment to go to the bathroom and get something to eat. I came back with a bowl of Kraft mac and cheese when I noticed a beeping sound and a blinking green light on the monitor. It was a ping. I sat back down and grabbed a headset, turning the volume up to listen.

*…thump…thump…thump…thump…*

Have you ever tried talking to a friend with two tin cans tied to a string? Have you then listened to it when someone plucks on the string? It sounded like that, only a bit muffled. They were sparse, but definitely rhythmic. Maybe some kind of quasar? Well, it wasn't my job to know, just to log the signal. I made a note of it and checked its direction on the computer. Then I went outside to confirm the position of the dish and the constellations. The dish was perfectly aligned, but what it was pointing at made me pause.

It was pointed right at the moon.

Now, I can imagine what you might be thinking. ""Welp, moon's haunted."" But even in that moment, as I stared up at our nearest celestial neighbor, that hadn't crossed my mind. I may not have been an expert on radios, but I knew enough to know that you could use the moon to reflect radio waves. More likely the dish caught a stray broadcast from somewhere else on Earth. What confused me, however, was the sound. If it was from somewhere on Earth, it's a strange thing to broadcast. If I didn't know better, I'd say it was just like a heartbeat.

I decided to call it a night after that and went to bed early. I woke up again around 6 AM. After breakfast (if you can call a dry bowl of Froot Loops a breakfast; the minifridge was out of milk), I read more Lord of the Rings, napped, then went outside and watched the wildlife. I saw a deer this time.

I leaned back in my lawn chair and stared up at the sky. Though no stars were yet visible, I could see the moon. I had almost forgotten about that signal from last night, but it got me thinking about something. I’ve never understood the whole ""search for alien life"" thing. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that there is intelligent life out in the universe. What would be the point in searching for it? Why would we want to make contact? You could say peace or scientific progress, but I don't buy that. I think people look up at the stars and want to believe there's life out there because they're afraid of the alternative, that we're truly alone, floating in a sea of emptiness and void. Even those stories about something evil lurking in the cosmos are a twisted form of that hope because anything would be easier to grasp than nothing. If we're really all there is, then that says something about us. In a way, the night sky is a reflection into ourselves. It is asking what makes us human, so how would we answer?

Before I knew it, the sun had started to set, which meant it was time to go back to work. I threw in a microwave dinner and moved to the back room. Once again, I turned the computer on and aligned the dish, then sat back and waited.

I woke up to the sound of another ping. If I had to guess, this was probably around 2 AM. I groggily put the headset on and began to listen.

*…thudthudthud…thudthudthud…*

It was similar to the first signal from the other night, but with a different rhythm. It had a few rapid bursts with pauses in between. I couldn't make sense of what it was. It was almost as if…

I spun around in my chair, knocking my headset off in the process. I was frozen. Eyes glued to the open doorway. Ears listening carefully down the hall and through the waiting room.

*…thudthudthud…*

I hope it provides some encouragement. (We'll see if I have to post in two parts...)*

Last night I sent a text to someone I barely met (I had her number via a mutual friend). I found her very attractive (not just looks) so I asked if she'd be willing to meet me for coffee or a walk. What will come of this? I haven’t a clue, but I find myself now fervently praying she responds well. If she doesn’t, however, as a licensed falconer my lessons from road-trapping\* my hawks provide perspective and calm me to a great degree. I worked up a proverb to express this perspective:

*As trapping a hawk and living with it in harmony requires desire, initiative, decisiveness, patience, and competency, so too does finding and living well with a mate.*

I understand why it would seem wrong to apply the metaphor of *trapping* to the dynamics of dating and courtship. “What?!?,” you say. “You are equating *trapping* to finding companionship?!?” Sure, because this metaphor (while imperfect) works. You have to admit that much of the dynamic interplay between potential partners comes down to attractiveness, however one personally defines it (beauty being in the eye of the beholder), and some synonyms for attracting are: luring/alluring, tempting, *captivating*. How many poems and songs have been written with this very theme? So, why not use an aspect of the sport of falconry for a metaphor I can relate to as I consider dating again after so many years? I could talk about the other method of acquiring a raptor via legal purchase of a captive-bred bird, or as a transfer from another falconer, but then I’d have to shift gears, those methods being more analogous to an arranged marriage!

When I started learning road-trapping with my apprentice falconer son, and then on into a number of years of my own experiences trapping for myself or helping other falconers, I or we would toss a trap in a great location under a hawk, and wait and wait...and wait, hoping that bird would decide it was worth it to go down and investigate. There have been some beautiful hawks which I or we spent upwards of three hours on, hoping for them to hit the trap. In the end it has always been a waste of time and I had to learn the discipline of just moving on. To be sure some birds will dance around or even on the trap without getting caught, and this might take a while. One has to learn patience in those situations, but those hawks at least *come to the trap*. They’re just working things out, *wanting* to go after the bait. That waiting can, but not always, find success in the end. Generally speaking, though, if nothing much happens within between 5 and 15 minutes it really is best to move on. Flying around the trap fits in the category of “nothing much happening” even though it certainly gets the adrenaline flowing. 

Falconry is all about partnership and companionship. Trapping is *not at all* equivalent to the saying, “’Come into my web,’ said the spider to the fly!” With falconry there is no intention to devour, but rather to build trust. I *care for* my birds, treating them as well as I possibly can. I love them. This creates an amazing, sublime, ineffable bond. We begin to understand each other and work with each other. I try to learn each hawk’s “personality” (anthropomorphizing, of course, but still true in essence) so that *I* can adapt, to better work with her in unity of purpose. My hawks also learn about *me*, and adapt to my approach (for example, the things I do in the field to help them acquire food.) In truth, by placing the trap to begin with, I am offering the hawk a much better life than were she to stay in the wild. She will receive full medical coverage, excellent food, and will typically live longer than most of her peers of the same age! Loneliness is a killer.

When I toss the trap now, as opposed to earlier in my falconry career, I can relax in the idea that if it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be. I don’t get desperate, while admittedly still having the adrenaline flow. If that gorgeous bird stays up on its perch, showing no interest, I accept that she is meant for some other purpose. I receive a trapped hawk as a *gift*, truly believing that God himself intended for that very specific bird to be my partner.

If I am to take joy in falconry, I necessarily have to start with *taking the initiative* to find a hawk. While I can take the path of an arranged marriage *or* trapping, in either case a *decision* to pursue plus the requisite work to become competent in treating my hawk well are foundational to taking that initiative and all else which follows. Once out looking for a hawk, I need patience for the right one to come along, not sweating it if none do on any given outing. If the desire, decision, and competency are not present I should absolutely not enter into that partnership. I simply have to come to terms with whether I am ready, willing, and able.

\* Road-trapping involves driving around, looking for a hawk on a perch. The falconer has a cage called a *bal-chatri* which is covered with fishing line snares, and inside the cage is a live rodent or two. When the falconer finds a suitable hawk he places the trap in a safe place within eyesight of the bird. The hawk ideally flies down to get a meal and instead gets snared. (The hawk and rodents survive the encounter in good health.)",2,1752977275.0,widowers,0,1.0,False

I’m currently waiting for authorization to see a dietitian.

Before the diagnosis, I used to eat about a third of a large bag of chips during my 10-minute work breaks, around five times a week. For breakfast, I typically had 3 eggs and 2 slices of sandwich bread with 2 cups of instant coffee with some 2% milk. For lunch, I would eat a bag of frozen pasta or about 3/4 pound of smoked chicken hearts.

Since the diagnosis, I’ve made some changes. For breakfast, I now eat 2 slices of whole wheat bread with half an avocado and one boiled egg and oat milk instead of the 2%. During my work breaks, I eat an avocado instead of chips. For other meals, I’ve been trying to eat a mix of grains (like barley, lentils, and beans) with a can of tuna.

1150a: sat on the toilet and wiped alcohol on my thigh. Took off the gray cap and pressed down, expecting a bee sting.

1215p: I noticed the funny feeling started to subside, I remained seated. 

1225p: I felt back to normal, yay!

2pm: I was driving and felt nausea. Is my driving making me car sick? Possibly.

I've tried various models, from basic to high-end, and I want to share my experiences to help you find the best electric tea kettle for your needs.

Electric kettles have come a long way from the simple plug-and-boil devices of the past. Today's models offer features like precise temperature control, quick heating, and even smart connectivity. But with so many options out there, how do you choose?

First, consider your primary use. Are you a tea enthusiast who needs different water temperatures for various types of tea? Or do you just want hot water fast for instant coffee or noodles? Your needs will guide your choice.

For tea lovers, temperature control is crucial. Green tea, for example, is best brewed at around 175°F, while black tea needs hotter water at about 200°F. Look for kettles with preset temperature options or variable temperature control.

Speed is another important factor. A good electric kettle should boil water faster than a stovetop kettle or microwave. Most electric kettles can bring water to a boil in 3-5 minutes, depending on the volume.

Capacity is worth considering too. If you're brewing for one or two people, a 1-liter kettle might suffice. For larger households or frequent entertainers, consider models with 1.5 to 2-liter capacities.

Safety features are a must. Auto shut-off is standard in most modern kettles, turning the device off when water reaches boiling point or if it runs dry. Some models also have boil-dry protection and cool-touch exteriors.

Material is another consideration. Stainless steel kettles are durable and easy to clean. Glass kettles let you see the water level and boiling process, which can be oddly satisfying. Plastic kettles are lightweight but may affect water taste and aren't as durable.

After trying various models, I've found that kettles with gooseneck spouts offer better control when pouring, especially for pour-over coffee. They're also great for precise tea brewing.

One feature I've grown to appreciate is a keep-warm function. It maintains water at your desired temperature for a set period, perfect for those who like to sip tea throughout the day.

Noise level might not seem important until you've used a particularly loud kettle. Some models are designed to boil water more quietly, which can be a blessing in open-plan homes or offices.

Ease of cleaning is another factor to consider. Kettles with wide openings are easier to clean and descale. Some even have removable filters to catch mineral deposits.

While researching for this post, I came across a great selection of electric kettles that tick many of these boxes. You can check them out here: https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. They've got options for various needs and budgets.

In my experience, investing in a good electric kettle is worth it if you're a regular tea or coffee drinker. It saves time, offers convenience, and can even enhance your brewing experience with precise temperature control.

Remember, the best electric tea kettle for you depends on your specific needs and preferences. Consider the features that matter most to you, read reviews, and don't be afraid to invest a bit more for quality. A good kettle can last for years and make your daily brewing ritual a pleasure.",1,1752976962.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

I’ve built few projects using ReactJS and Next.js, and I have experience working with Supabase for backend. I’ve been focusing on personal projects full-time, which kept me out of the job market and not actively looking for paid gigs.

Recently, I got desperate for money and, by coincidence, ended up chatting with a guy at a coffee shop. I mentioned what I do, hoping he might need a website or know someone who does. He said he needed one, and I offered to build a mockup first to show what I could do before committing to anything more like setting up his own github and vercel accounts, teaching him how to edit some parts of the code, etc.

After five days of solid work, I delivered a mockup: a modern landing page, a basic e-commerce shop (no credit card handling, just contact-based), and two other pages. I even created some of the media assets myself, tailored to his niche, trying to make a strong impression.

When it came to pricing, I did some research on local agency rates and offered him $800, which was between half and one-third of what they typically charge reasonable for a freelancer. But he ghosted me. When I finally called, he said he *liked* the site but thought my price was way too high. He got upset, even raised his voice, saying websites are free, he could make one on Wix, or that some “local agency” quoted him way cheaper.

I told him I didn’t want money to be the reason we don’t work together and asked him to suggest a price he had in mind. He avoided giving a number and just said, “Maybe we’ll meet again at the coffee shop sometime and talk about it then.”

Honestly, it felt like lowballing mixed with not appreciating the value of having a proper digital presence. And yeah, I probably wouldn’t have hoped for anything from him if I weren’t in such a desperate situation.

So now here I am, wondering:  
**Is there any quick way to make money with the skills I have?**

I don’t really have the luxury of time to start from scratch on Fiverr or other freelancing platforms, building a profile with reviews, etc. I’d really appreciate hearing your advice or if anyone has been through something similar, I’d love to hear how you dealt with it.

People just froze. Our manager literally choked on her coffee. Instead of explaining, Kyle pulls out some Cheetos and starts feeding the raccoon under his desk like it’s a golden retriever. The thing climbs on his keyboard and knocks over his second monitor.

By lunchtime, HR got involved. Not because of the raccoon yet but because someone from client services was wildly allergic to animals and had to leave after having a reaction. Kyle insisted Rigby had “papers” and even threatened legal action if anyone “discriminated against his needs.”

Turns out, Rigby wasn’t even his raccoon. It was his roommate’s rescue animal, and Kyle had been watching too many “support animal loophole” TikToks. In the end, he got suspended for a week and had to write a formal apology.",11,1752976499.0,coworkerstories,4,0.83,False

Basically I have started to run into an issue in my relationship where my boyfriend is very extroverted and I’m very introverted. 

I’ve known that I am introverted and I guess I didn’t think much of my boyfriend liking to be out with friends more when we first got together, 2 years ago. But now for the past eight months we’ve lived together. I think I was more interested and willing to go out and spend time with him and his friends and his family often because we were still new and I was wanting to get to know him get to know his friends get to know his family, his life. 

And don’t get me wrong I don’t dislike these people in his life at all. His family is great. I get along with his friends. But every weekend, it’s something. As in they’re always trying to go somewhere and do something. I understand that that’s normal for most people. And I would always go with them here and there I would opt out because I was sick. As I suffer from migraines. But lately the past couple months I’m so worn out and I feel like I’ve been disregarding my own health mentally or just who I am as a person maybe. So I’ve started to put my foot down and not wanting to go, which has led my boyfriend to question me. 

I tried to explain that I’m introverted, but he just doesn’t really seem to get it. He said he hears what I’m saying but that he just doesn’t relate to it and can’t really understand where I’m coming from. I said that I understood why he would struggle with understanding the fact that going out to a friend’s house and staying there for 8+ hours with blaring music and constantly having to be entertaining and conversing with others is draining for me… because he enjoys that kind of stuff because he’s extroverted. 

He basically responded with well if you don’t like that stuff then why are you with me? I took this the wrong way and kind of started to get really emotional and upset and wanna have a full-blown conversation on if he’s even happy in this relationship and he says that he is but that he’s not willing to stop hanging out with his friends. I explain that I’m not asking him to stop hanging out with his friends that I’m not even quite sure what I’m asking of him. I’m just trying to explain how I feel. We seem to have understood each other a little better by this point, and he said that I don’t have to go out with him when he goes out with his friends. But it’s OK for me to stay home if that’s what I’d rather do. 

The thing is, I don’t have any friends of my own. Not one my only friend is my sibling who lives in a different state so I can’t just drive and see them whenever I want. I have attempted to make friends here, but I haven’t had much luck because it’s like I don’t mesh good with others?? Like I get along with people, but it says if people want more out of me than I’m willing to put in the effort. As in, I’d like to have a friend to maybe go to a coffee shop or grab lunch maybe once a month for like an hour or two… but other people wanna hang out multiple times a week the way my boyfriend does with his friends. 

We both were getting a bit confused and worked up because I didn’t truly know how to learn how I’m feeling or what to really say. I know I’ve been feeling this way, but I just don’t know what the solution would be so I was just kind of rambling off, trying to make sense of how I feel to him which I think really contribute it to the confusion. So we both stepped away from the conversation. Which is brought to us by I come home from my job and he tells me that his friends are coming over to our place where I was not told this previously and had no time to prepare, which caused me to get very overwhelmed mentally because I personally don’t really like for people to be over at my house often… especially without much warning.. I mean for some people I’m sure it was more than enough of a warning because he told me about 6+ hours in advance before they would get there. 

From our day-to-day life, it’s kind of just we go to work and we come home. We’ll have a little chitchat here and there, but for the most part, he’s on his video game in a call with a bunch of other guys for hours on end. We don’t eat dinner together we eat it separately. I usually eat at the TV and he eats at his game. Maybe once or twice a month we’ll go grab lunch together. Just us too, but other than that we only ever do anything one on one like a couple times a year…. Honestly, I don’t even know what I would want to do. I don’t have many ideas of what we could do together that involve just us too. That doesn’t cost a lot of money… to him sitting at home and watching a movie is boring. He told me that if he’s just sitting there doing nothing then it’s because he’s experiencing depression. Which my favorite thing to do is just sit on the couch with nothing to do, but whatever I want. 

I’m trying to talk to him about this before and how I felt like we don’t spend enough time together and we started watching movies before bed but my work schedule changed to the point where that’s not possible because I now go to bed at like 8 PM because I open at work now and he doesn’t have to go to bed until midnight if he wants to because he works at 9 to 5. I’ve also tried to play video games with him, but he seems to not understand that I’m wanting it to be just us too and kept inviting friends and I explained to him that I was warning for it to just be us to. He says that someone so messaged me wanting to play a game and I said that I was gonna be playing this with you and they asked if they could join and I just feel bad telling them no. 

But the way that I reacted to it had him feel like he should change the plan so now they went to one of the other guys houses and he’s currently there now and that is why I am typing this post because I would like some ways to balance our relationship and compromise because I am happy with my life here and my relationship with him.

1m4czwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1m4czwy/reading_books_4_years_deep_still_the_1_mindset/,Reading books. 4 years deep. still the #1 mindset hack I've ever found,"I didn't start reading because some productivity guru told me to. Not because I wanted to sound smart at parties. My college roommate (philosophy major) told me that's what the ancient Stoics did they read every morning to train their minds. Idk if that was even true.

**How to Start (If You Haven't Read a Book Since High School):**

* Pick something you're genuinely curious about. Not what you think you ""should"" read. Curious about money? Read ""Rich Dad Poor Dad."" Into psychology? Try ""Thinking, Fast and Slow."" Love stories? Pick up fiction that actually makes you think.
* Start with 10 pages. Not 50. Not ""I'll read for an hour."" Just 10 pages. Every morning. Before you touch your phone just read.
* Physical books only (at least at first). Your phone has trained you to skim and jump around. Books train you to go deep.
* Keep it visible. Put the book next to your bed. On your coffee table. Make it easier to grab than your phone.

Your attention span gets longer. Your thoughts get clearer. You start seeing patterns everywhere because you're feeding your brain actual substance instead of digital candy.

**But here's where people screw it up:**

1. They try it once, get bored, and quit. Yeah no shit it feels slow at first. Your brain is used to getting dopamine hits every 3 seconds. It's supposed to feel weird. Give it two weeks. Minimum.
2. They ease into it. Start with audiobooks or short articles. Nope. Pick up a real book. Physical pages. Make your brain do the work. Get the real effect of focused, sustained attention.
3. They treat it like homework. It's not a chore. It's mental strength training. Don't just ""get through pages"" lean into the ideas. Make it a daily win.

After 4 years:

* My attention span went from goldfish to laser-focused
* I stopped falling for clickbait and surface-level thinking
* Conversations got deeper because I had actual thoughts, not just reactions
* Problems started looking like puzzles instead of disasters
* I became the guy people come to for advice

Still reading. Still sometimes feels like work. Still doing it. I think it's flipped my relationship with discipline, because in the end, not being disciplined means you stop once it requires effort.

Try it tomorrow. No thinking. Just grab a book and read 10 pages. Let me know how it hits your brain differently than scrolling. And start with something you're actually interested in curiosity beats discipline.

1m4czah,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m4czah,Some kind of pest and some discolouration issue,"Hey all. Second season growing and this years been a challenge. Im zone 6a. I’m growing a determinate variety this year and I’m noticing some bug damage (got a pic of one of them- not sure if flea beetles or aphids). But more concerning is some black spotting on the edges of leaves and some discolouration on some of the leaves. Some of the buds have yellowing but the fruit looks fine. They are in a new planter (new soil) with wood chips down as mulch. I haven’t fertilized in a bit but put some coffee grounds around the bases before mulching maybe two months ago. They are supported by cage type trellises. Keep in mind the plants overall are green with no discolouration on the stems. The pictures I grabbed were the worst of the worst.

I’m looking for advice on how to deal with these issues. I’m assuming it’s some sort of nutrient deficiency. All my fertilizers say “Don’t use in extreme heat” and we’ve had temps in the 80s-90s for the past couple weeks.

I’m going to a do a cleanup pruning tomorrow. What else should I do to give these plants some help?

1m4cxkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1m4cxkr/my_ex_was_abusive_and_has_undiagnosed_mental/,My ex was abusive and has undiagnosed mental health issues,"I (M 27) had been with my ex for the past 4 years my ex let’s call her “Lydia” From Vietnam but lived and studied in Ireland  (F 28) we got along so well and she was studying in college. She had asked me (who lived with my parents) if I wanted to move in with her into her college dorm as she said it would be nice to try and we could live together and it would help her by lessening the rent for her but increasing it for me. As soon as we lived together that’s when the issues arose. Whenever we argued about little things like dishes or cleaning the house or anything for that matter she would always cry and I mean ALWAYS. I would try my best to calm her down and usually just drop any argument that I brought up to her as no matter how slight the problem was she would always get emotional and upset. Fast forward to our last year together we had moved in with my grandfather. She had an eating disorder that would come up a lot during the relationship which I tried to help her with but it became difficult as she would say if I didn’t eat enough or more than her then she would starve herself and it would be my fault…again I tried to help her with this suggesting going to her doctor etc. after the years we had been together she suddenly got very nit picky with who I was as a person. E.g

1. My hygiene: she would ask me to brush my teeth a lot maybe 5 times a day and ask me to shower twice in a day if I wanted anything to “happen with her in bed” I became very focused on my hygiene and very anxious about it as I already thought I was a very clean person. This has bled into my life after we broke up..making me doubt myself 

2. My place of work: I work in a Popular Retail Store in Ireland called Dunnes Stores and get paid 17 euro an hour. She would constantly bring up that I didn’t make enough money to support “her” lifestyle not “us” but her lifestyle and would belittle me day in and day out telling me if I didn’t find a better paying job or have a better work ethic that she would dump me (she would threaten this multiple times over the last year)

3. She had told me she developed a crush on someone she worked with because he had better work ethic and a better job than me. This made me feel awful about myself. She would say she didn’t have a crush on him and then a month later would say she actually did…this happened alot and made me feel insecure and tired in our relationship and very worried…

She had threatened to break up with me if I did not go to Vietnam with her a certain year to see her family…so I went…

The times that we did argue a lot of the time she would calm down after having a huge cry session but other times she had threatened suicide if I didn’t do what she had asked. She would threaten to hurt herself which she did on many occasions (punch, slap and cut herself if I didn’t do as she asked..) 

When I would try and comfort her during arguments she would slap me…dig her nails into my arms, push me back, kick me, throw her phone or anything she had nearby at me while she huddled up in the corner of the room arms wrapped around her legs in a ball formation rocking back and forth. When this would happen I would either give her space or make her food to calm down or give her a foot massage which always calmed her down while I helped her talk through her problems and stress.

However this eventually got too much for me to handle and I felt manipulated and hurt as she would hurt me more often during the weeks. 

She had broke up with me in March of this year because she claimed “we” where too toxic to eachother in the relationship and that “we” needed space and time alone 

I was really upset at the time because I felt like I put my whole life on hold to help her and be there for her and protect her. The week she broke up with me was the week I started to stand up for myself and told her she can’t keep hitting me and blaming me for all our issues as the stress affected me so much that I asked my dr to be put on antidepressants. Me standing up for myself and her admitting to liking the guy she had a crush on was enough for her to call it and leave the relationship. 

I recently told my family how she treated me and they were all in shock.. that I had put up with the physical and emotional abuse from “Lydia”

She had moved out 
Both of our mutual friends have taken my side as they had seen or heard the way Lydia would treat me.

But the thing is… I’m an overly caring person and I know she has a lot of mental issues and though we haven’t spoke since the breakup 

I still hope everyday that she’s happy and healthy and a part of me wants to sit down with her for a coffee and see her smile again… a part of me wants her back for reasons unknown.. maybe because I felt like more of a guardian to her than an actual partner.

A week after we broke up we met up for a coffee and she had told me she asked the guy that she had a crush on out…in which to my surprise he said no to her as he was to be her boss in the job they worked at and though it to be unprofessional.. this broke me the fact we where together 4 years and it took her a week to already ask someone out…I couldn’t wrack my brain around it.

I had asked could we be friends…she denied it saying I hurt her in ways I couldn’t understand 

Everyday since the breakup memories both good and bad keep replaying in my head that won’t leave me alone. 

Even though she was abusive and unkind near the end.. I can’t help but feel like things could still be fixed.

Though I want her back either friends or relationship to try again I’m already aware that it’s near impossible that it will never happen that way 

Deleting her photos giving her friends her stuff back has been slowly killing me inside…it’s like I’m feeling grief of a death of this relationship.

But I keep telling myself “as long as she’s happy with or without me that should be enough for me” 

If anyone has any advice on how to deal with this struggle I’ll greatly take it onboard thank you for reading.

There is no chance of us getting back together as I know she’s very much done with me

But a man can dream.

Abusive as she was she was everything to me and all I wanted was to help her…

Thank you for reading my story and feel free to share any advice
