I told him I cried for him, that he had an impact on me, all of it. I just needed to let it out.
Now, I‚Äôm kinda freaking out. I don‚Äôt know if I just made a dumb choice again, but I also know I would‚Äôve regretted it if I kept it all in. He told me he misses me too and that I should just accept that these things happen. He also said that about a month after I ended things, he started losing feelings‚Äîbut somehow, they‚Äôre still there. That‚Äôs why he agreed to meet up for coffee.

The next day he invited me to meet up with him, this time it‚Äôs only us two, he paid for everything, i asked him what we were doing if it was a date or just a hang out, he said he doesn‚Äôt know.
I asked if he still has feelings for me, and he said yes‚Ä¶ but sometimes, he‚Äôs not sure. Then he said he still likes me. I don‚Äôt even know what to think. he also told me he was very heartbroken that time and but he holds no resentment. I just hope he gets it. I hope‚ÄîI don‚Äôt even know what I hope for.

Context: He was the guy who confessed on december 2024 to me, he liked me since 10th grade and we‚Äôre in 12th grade now about to graduate in 2 weeks and I ended up falling for him too. But I broke things off because something he did (nothing bad, just made me feel like he wasn‚Äôt serious and was only talking to me for fun). Two months later, our mutual friend invited us to a coffee shop, and that‚Äôs how we started talking again. (It would be a very long read if i said everything on detail)

He‚Äôs wealthy and has some obvious mommy issues. It started with small gestures, like him bringing her coffee, then taking her out to breakfast, and eventually giving her a weekly allowance of $240. Recently, he even bought her a brand-new 2025 Ford Bronco Sport.

She insists that their relationship isn‚Äôt transactional and swears she has never done anything sexual with him. People will say im being naive but I truly do believe her when she says this. However, she has admitted to developing feelings for him. She likes being taken care of and provided for, and she now finds him attractive. Long story short: she asked for my blessing to date him.

I‚Äôm just like‚Ä¶ EW. I don‚Äôt mind age gaps, but an almost 50-year difference?? He has grandkids and is older than our dad. I just can‚Äôt get behind the idea of my sister being with him. She deserves someone closer to her age & someone she can actually build a future with.

It was supposed to be just one date, pero one turned into two, then three, then four. Every time you texted me, I found myself smiling like a tanga. And every time we went out, I kept wondering‚Äîdoes he even like me? You never flirted, never made a move. The most intimate thing you did was pinch my cheek.

Then one night, I told you I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Then you said, ‚ÄúSunduin kita, magkape tayo sa Antipolo‚Äù it was already 11 PM. You picked me up, and we went to this overlooking caf√©. I don‚Äôt know how our conversation ended up there, but you started opening up about your past relationship‚Äîseven years. I just listened, but I saw the pain in your eyes.

Then you admitted that when you got on Bumble, you were only looking for hookups. Aray. I thought we had something good. I thought we were different. So I asked, ‚ÄúBakit hindi mo ako niyaya mag-sex?‚Äù

And your answer made me fall even harder. ‚ÄúAng sarap mo kasama, ang bait mo. Kaya naisip ko, ‚ÄòWag na lang. Wholesome dates na lang.‚Äù

And yet, it still happened. Ako pa yung nagyaya. Ako yung nag-suggest. Maybe because I wanted to prove to myself na I could keep it casual, too. Maybe I just wanted to test if you‚Äôd still stay after.

But you didn‚Äôt just stay‚Äîyou made it impossible not to fall.

You would pick me up every other day, not just for sex, but for dates, for coffee runs, for late-night drives. You‚Äôd never forget to kiss me pag sinusundo mo ako, or pag hinahatid mo na ako. We‚Äôd go for a run together, and when I got tired, you‚Äôd kiss me. You‚Äôd hold my hand habang nagda-drive, you‚Äôd steal kisses pag red light. One time I sad ‚Äúang ganda ng moon‚Äù you answered withouth hesitation ‚Äúmas maganda ka‚Äù. Fuck i melted. 

You introduced me to your dad. We spent New Year‚Äôs Eve together sa BGC countdown. You remembered my favorite food, how I like my milk tea, and kahit busy ako or tulog, you‚Äôd still update me with random photos and videos‚Äîlike you just wanted me to be part of your day kahit wala ako. That set-up went on for months.

I felt safe with you. Hindi lang dahil you took care of me, pero kasi you made me feel wanted. Hindi lang for sex, pero for my company, for my presence, for who I was.

Paano hindi mahulog?

Then came February 8.

We went to SM Aura, had dinner, tapos nag-check-in after. That night, you just wanted to cuddle. Kahit tumalikod ako, you still hugged me. And that‚Äôs when I knew. Something felt off. It felt like the beginning of the end.

Tapos habang pa-uwi tayo, bigla mong sinabi, ‚ÄúI think we need to stop na.‚Äù

I knew it. I felt it. Kaya pala ang bigat ng pakiramdam ko.

And I just let you talk.

‚ÄúNafefeel ko kasi na naiinlove ka na sa akin. I tried to reciprocate, but I don‚Äôt know if kaya ko pang magmahal uli. But I care for you, and we both knew naman na this setup had to end at some point.‚Äù

Tangina. Sobrang sakit. But I just smiled, held it in, and said, ‚ÄúI tried not to fall for you naman, but you made it so hard not to.‚Äù

That was all I could say. Then silence. The longest, heaviest car ride of my life.

Pagbaba ko, I couldn‚Äôt hold it in anymore‚Äîumiyak na lang ako hanggang makarating sa unit ko. The whole day, I just cried.

I know you felt something, too. I wasn‚Äôt imagining it. I wasn‚Äôt making it up. You did care. Maybe not the way I wanted you to, but I know you did.

I get it. You were hurt. You were healing. Maybe I was just a part of that process. And kahit ang sakit, I still wish you nothing but happiness.

At least, kahit sandali lang, I knew what it felt like to be this happy.

I still check your IG sometimes. We‚Äôre still mutuals. Pero I‚Äôm trying so hard not to break contact. Trying so hard to move on.",2,1743005325.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

I am researching buying a my first roaster. I have been doing pan roast for the past few months and have had some good results but I want some consistency. 

I am hoping to find something for between ¬£300/¬£400 ( I am UK based )

I have been looking at 

Skywalker on Amazon which is ¬£389
Sr800 with the tube through home roastingsuppies.com which after postage and a transformer will be around ¬£350
Gene cafe second hand coming in around ¬£400

My question is is there anything I should be thinking about? Oh and if you have any other suggestions on where to get a roaster in the UK I am all ears. 

I am thinking about batch sizes and longevity. I plan on roasting for myself maybe selling some to friends and family to pay for more coffee. 

Thanks

I've never hit 300, but I got dangerously close at one point.  I seem to fluctuate between 275 and 285.  I'm trying to finally make the changes I need to get to a better place, but the mentality is difficult.

I have a hard time with healthy eating habits if I'm not going to the gym.  I know the diet is the vast majority of weight control, but it's a mental thing.  I can't form the good habits if I'm not doing all of it, and my schedule is full right now.  Working full time, 3 kids, a semi-part time job, and I'm in graduate school.  So free time isn't a luxury I can even take time to dream about right now.

I've already (mostly) cut out pop.  On Fridays, we do our cheat dinner and I usually get a pop with that, though I didn't the last two weeks and I'm trying to follow that going forward.  I was getting a sugar free creamer for my coffee, and even then trying to limit it to just weekends and sticking with water during the week, but once in a while I slip and go back to my normal coffee (just milk and sugar).  Though to be totally fair to myself, not having coffee my normal way for about a month made it much easier for me to only put one scoop of sugar in as opposed to what I used to do, which was close to 3.

I feel like other than sugar, which I'm starting to get a good handle on, my other big issue is portion control.  Fat Fridays wouldn't be a problem if I had two slices of pizza instead of 4 or 5, or if I got a Coke Zero or something similar if I needed to satisfy the craving for pop.  So my solution is to try and finally start meal prepping and hope that helps me get this crap under control.  I don't expect to be skinny by the time I'm 41 of course, but my goal is to have made at least *some* progress before my next birthday.  I figure if I've made progress before I'm OUT of being 40, then it is a good enough step in the right direction.

I don't want to overdo it with prepping.  Just something simple that I can make on Sunday and have during the week.  What are some basics of food prep that I should focus on if I want this to finally be my turning point?

TL;DR - I want to meal prep and not fail this time.  Hoping for simple advice to get started.",1,1743005067.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

I am a gentle/soft Domme Goddess with a highlight in Findom. I am talented in text based roleplay and enjoy fantasy script (think kingdoms, dragons, and magic).

I only accept willing submissives. During roleplay you may have a reluctant energy/despise my character, however, outside of text based roleplay I expect a 'yes ma'am' attitude.

I favor long term submissives / pets.
I want to be able to get to know you. Build a connection with you as a person. You're welcome to your secrets, but I want you to know your feelings are safe with me. I offer comfort, guidance, and an escape to help you through life. I need to be able to care about you.

I absolutely love to be spoiled, given gifts, and having you empty your wallet for me, but I will not ask for it. Your willingness to send needs to be of your own free will proving just how much control I have over you. That I occupy your mind, even when I'm not there.

As for you coffee bitches, my starbucks usually costs approx $8. I will not ask, just send.

I do consultations in my DM's to see if we are a good fit. Do not approach me with sexual comments, you will not like the concequences. 

I am not interested in live video chat. 
Calls may be approved for long term submissives.

After our consultation, If you are interested in being my submissive, please be a good boy and find my loyalfans and subscribe and message me ""I am ready to be yours"".

1jkf0s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/usvisascheduling/comments/1jkf0s5/visa_experience_delhi/,Visa experience | Delhi,"My visa got approved a few days ago, and hence, I wanted to share my experience here. I was very skeptical since I had no clue about lockers etc, hence sharing this post - if this could be of any help to anyone. My visa application was for a vacation with family. We don't have any reference letters or anything. I won't go through the basics of website where one can apply etc etc. I am sharing the details once I got the appointment confirmation. It took us almost a year from applying to appointment.

Country: India

Visa type: Tourist

**Appointment 1: OFC | total time: approx 40 mins per person**

*Location: Visa application center, Shivaji Stadium Metro Station*

This place was to verify the documents and biometric scan. I press the buttons on the small poles and not on the stickers near the lift. As those stickers did nothing. I went to -2, which they call the concourse level. Our timing was 5:15 pm, but we reached at 4 pm. The security guard asked us to get in line. Once in the queue, we got the documents - appointment confirmation, passport, and DS-160 confirmation prints validated by the VAC personnel. They would mark the appointment letter with their sketch pen and then we reached the security at the gate. He too checked the documents one more time and let you go inside.

Once inside, there was a security check before we queued up for document verification. It's a small reception area where they checked our documents, pasted a sticker behind the passport, and stamped the DS-160. Then again, we queued up for biometrics. The VAC personnel guided us to a window where our fingers were scanned for their prints. That's it.

**Attire:** Formals

**Remember:** no gadgets - phone, smart watch, etc. You can, however, wear analog watches. Men's wallet is allowed, and so are small purses for ladies. Big bags are no no. Be patient, as the line can be long. Ensure that your hands have legible lines that can be scanned, or else you will be asked to rub your hands again and again.

**Lockers:** Lockers are available there, hence no problem.

**Car parking:** There is DLF Capitol Point mall nearby where you can park. Else, you can also park your car in front of Hanuman Temple parking, which is hardly 400 meters.

\-------------------  
**Appointment 2: Consular | total time: approx 4 hours**

*Location: U.S. Embassy*

Our appointment time was 10:50 am, and we reached the embassy at 8:45 am. There was a huge crowd. People were not allowed to line up in front of the embassy gate, rather, they were asked to stand on the opposite lane, which also had a few carts selling water, juice, and snacks. The security asked me to deposit all the electronic items + phone somewhere as it's not allowed inside. I asked the guard if there was any place where I could deposit our phones. He said, ""I dunno,"" pointing towards the carts, ""ask them"". We waited till 9:30 am when I saw people asking autos to take them to ""locker"". While these roadside carts keep phones and bags, I was skeptical. Hence, I, too, took an auto to the locker. The auto charged Rs 100 to and fro. When I reached the place, it was a temple where there was his house depositing phones and bags in exchange of a token number and of course money. Paid Rs 300 for 2 phones. Wallets were allowed, hence I kept that with me.

Now, there was this line barricaded with a thick rope. We stood there. A security person came and announced on the mic inviting people who had their appointment timings till 11 am. We then crossed the road and queued up at the entrance. They scan you and then check your passport and again queue up.

Then the queue enters the door, where there is another round of checking. Belts, too, were removed and checked. We then exited to the place where there were rows of benches. It was like a temporary holding area. This place also has a washroom, water station, and a small tuck shop for snacks, all cash only. These rows had numbers starting from 1 to 6. The guy checked our passports and asked us to sit in a row. At 10:50 am, we were asked to go inside the embassy building.

Our queue went inside the huge, gigantic building, where I could see the VAC personnel guiding people to a few windows where they were checking our passports and asking us to then queue up for biometrics. Once the biometric was done, we joined a serpentine queue that led to these windows where embassy officers were seated behind these windows asking questions to people before approving or rejecting their visa requests. It was an open area where everyone could hear what was being asked and if requests were approved or rejected.

I heard a few of these common questions:

1. Why are you travelling to the US?
2. What is the purpose of your visit to the US?
3. Have you ever been to the US?
4. Have you ever been to any country other than the US? If yes, then which ones were those?
5. For how many days do you plan to stay in the US?
6. Where do you work?
7. How long have you been working there?
8. What is your yearly compensation? I replied in INR.
9. Do you have anyone in the US? If yes, then where in the US?
10. Where do you plan to visit in the US?
11. Why do you plan to visit that place in the US?

They would ask you around 4-5 questions. **Answer honestly and confidently** and what was filled in the application form while applying for the Visa. They tally your answers with the ones you filled. I heard the magic words - **approved**\- before we headed to the exit. Had some coffee at the exit before we opened the main door towards the street. Took an auto to the locker, got our stuff. It was 12:30 pm. Booked an Uber back home.

**Attire:** Business formals. No need to wear tie or suit. Just a formal shirt and trousers will do. Females wore Western or Indian formals. I saw a few people who wore revealing clothes being rejected. Not sure if it was their clothes or something else.

**Remember:**

* Be there at least 1 hour in advance.
* No gadgets are allowed - phone, smart watch, etc. You can, however, wear analog watches.
* Men's wallet is allowed, and so are small purses for ladies. Big bags are a big no no.
* People wore sunglasses inside, hence, it is allowed
* Use transparent folders. Keep 2: one for primary docs like passport, DS-160, and appointment confirmation. The other one is for secondary documents like aadhaar, employment certificate from work, ITS returns, bank statements, payslips, provisional pass certificates from degree onwards.
* You can ask for a translator or wheel chair. Just ask the security guard or VAC personnel.
* You will see a lot of people who came back holding their passports, which means they were rejected. Don't panic.
* Keep a smiling face till the conversation is over.
* Be polite
* And avoid counter questioning or arguing with the Visa officers.
* Carry some cash like Rs 600 to 1000. You never know if the autos charge you more.
* Avoid the corner auto rickshaws as they charge a lot. Choose the running autos inside the lane.

**Lockers:** Lockers are available nearby, hence no problem. Ask an auto and he would take you there for Rs 100. Remember, these are not the usual lockers. This is a small house where they have kept a few people who keep an eye on every people and their belongings.

**Car parking:** No, there is no car parking nearby. The closest is near India Gate, but that would be too far. Book and Uber.",1,1743004300.0,usvisascheduling,1,1.0,False

Whether you live in an apartment, a tiny home, or have a small backyard, a vertical garden allows you to maximize greenery without sacrificing valuable space.

In this guide, we‚Äôll explore how to grow a thriving vertical garden in small spaces, covering key techniques, best plant choices, design tips, and maintenance strategies.

**Why Choose a Vertical Garden?**

Vertical gardening is more than just an aesthetic choice ‚Äî it provides practical benefits:

‚úÖ¬†**Space-Saving Solution**: Ideal for apartments, balconies, and small yards.  
‚úÖ¬†**Better Air Quality**: Plants absorb toxins and release oxygen, improving indoor and outdoor air.  
‚úÖ¬†**Enhanced Insulation**: Helps regulate temperature, reducing heating and cooling costs.  
‚úÖ¬†**Higher Yield for Edibles**: Vertical gardens can increase food production per square foot.  
‚úÖ¬†**Aesthetic Appeal**: Turns bare walls or fences into lush, green spaces.

According to a 2023 report by the National Gardening Association, urban gardening has increased by¬†**44%**¬†over the last decade, largely due to the rise of vertical gardening solutions.

**Types of Vertical Gardens**

Depending on your space, budget, and plant preferences, there are various types of vertical gardens to consider:

**1. Trellis Systems**

* Ideal for climbing plants like ivy, cucumbers, or tomatoes.
* Can be made from wood, metal, or plastic.

**2. Wall Planters**

* Mounted on walls or fences, these can be modular or pocket-style.
* Best for herbs, flowers, and succulents.

**3. Hanging Gardens**

* Hanging pots or baskets suspended from ceilings, railings, or walls.
* Perfect for ferns, strawberries, and trailing plants.

**4. Hydroponic Vertical Gardens**

* Soil-free system using water and nutrients.
* Can yield¬†**30‚Äì50% more produce**¬†compared to soil-based gardening (USDA, 2022).

**5. Pallet Gardens**

* DIY-friendly; uses recycled wooden pallets for planting pockets.
* Works well for leafy greens, herbs, and flowers.

**Choosing the Right Plants**

The success of your vertical garden depends on selecting the right plants based on your light conditions, climate, and space availability.

**Best Plants for Vertical Gardens**

**Plant Type**

**Examples**

**Best Growing Conditions**

**Edibles**

Lettuce, strawberries, cherry tomatoes, basil, mint

Partial to full sunlight, well-draining soil

**Climbers**

Peas, beans, passionflower, clematis

Trellis support, moderate watering

**Succulents**

Aloe vera, jade plant, echeveria

Bright indirect light, minimal watering

**Flowers**

Petunias, pansies, nasturtiums

Full sun to partial shade, regular deadheading

**Herbs**

Thyme, rosemary, parsley, oregano

Bright light, well-draining soil

üí°¬†**Tip:**¬†Consider¬†**companion planting**¬†‚Äî group plants that benefit each other. For example, planting basil near tomatoes enhances flavor and deters pests.

**Building Your Vertical Garden**

Once you‚Äôve selected your garden type and plants, follow these steps to construct your vertical garden:

**Step 1: Choose the Right Location**

* **Indoor Gardens**: Find a bright window or install grow lights.
* **Outdoor Gardens**: Choose a sunny wall, fence, or balcony railing.

üåû¬†**Fact:**¬†Most edible plants need¬†**6‚Äì8 hours of sunlight**¬†per day. If your space lacks natural light, consider LED grow lights.

**Step 2: Select a Sturdy Structure**

* Use durable materials like¬†[**PVC pipes**](https://www.truegether.com/category/home-and-garden)**, wooden pallets, or metal grids**¬†to support plant weight.
* If attaching planters to walls, ensure the structure can hold¬†**at least 20‚Äì50 pounds**¬†of weight per section.

**Step 3: Use the Right Soil**

* **Lightweight, nutrient-rich potting mix**¬†is best.
* Add¬†**perlite or coconut coir**¬†for aeration and better moisture retention.

**Step 4: Install Proper Irrigation**

* **Drip irrigation**¬†is the most efficient method, reducing water waste by up to¬†**50%**¬†(EPA, 2021).
* Self-watering pots or hydroponic systems work well for low-maintenance setups.

**Step 5: Arrange Plants Strategically**

* Place¬†**larger plants at the bottom**¬†and¬†**lighter plants on top**¬†for balance.
* Consider¬†**vertical crop rotation**¬†‚Äî swap seasonal plants to maximize year-round growth.

**Maintaining a Thriving Vertical Garden**

Keeping your vertical garden healthy requires regular care.

**1. Watering Wisely**

* **Check moisture levels**¬†before watering. Overwatering is the top reason vertical gardens fail.
* Use a¬†**soaker hose**¬†or self-watering system for efficiency.

**2. Regular Pruning & Harvesting**

* Trim plants to promote air circulation and prevent overcrowding.
* Harvest herbs and vegetables frequently to encourage new growth.

**3. Pest & Disease Control**

* Introduce¬†**beneficial insects**¬†like ladybugs to combat pests.
* Use¬†**organic pest repellents**¬†(e.g., neem oil, garlic spray) instead of chemical pesticides.

**4. Fertilizing Appropriately**

* Use a¬†**balanced liquid fertilizer**¬†(10‚Äì10‚Äì10 NPK) every 3‚Äì4 weeks.
* Compost tea is a great organic alternative for added nutrients.

**Cost of Setting Up a Vertical Garden**

The cost varies based on materials, plants, and irrigation systems.

**Setup Type**

**Estimated Cost**

DIY Pallet Garden

$20 ‚Äî $50

Trellis System

$30 ‚Äî $100

Hanging Planters

$40 ‚Äî $150

Wall Planters

$50 ‚Äî $200

Hydroponic System

$100 ‚Äî $500+

üí∞¬†**Fact:**¬†A well-maintained vertical vegetable garden can save a household¬†**$600+ per year**¬†in grocery bills (National Gardening Survey, 2023).

**Innovative Vertical Gardening Ideas**

1. **Repurpose Household Items**: Use old shoe organizers, plastic bottles, or wooden crates as planters.
2. **Create a Living Wall**: Install a framed green wall with succulents or ferns indoors.
3. **Use Smart Planters**: Try IoT-enabled smart planters that monitor soil moisture and automate watering.

**Sustainable Vertical Gardening: Eco-Friendly Approaches**

Incorporating sustainability into your vertical garden not only benefits the environment but also enhances plant health and longevity. Here are some eco-friendly strategies:

**1. Use Recycled Materials**

* Repurpose old wooden pallets, tin cans, or plastic bottles as plant containers.
* Convert an old ladder into a tiered planter stand.

**2. Collect and Reuse Rainwater**

* Install a¬†**rainwater harvesting system**¬†to reduce water consumption.
* A simple¬†**rain barrel**¬†can store enough water for regular irrigation.

**3. Make Your Own Compost**

* Reduce waste by composting food scraps, coffee grounds, and yard clippings.
* Homemade compost improves soil fertility, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.

**4. Opt for Native Plants**

* Native plants require less water and maintenance.
* They attract local pollinators like bees and butterflies, supporting biodiversity.

üåç¬†**Fact:**¬†According to the EPA, sustainable gardening practices can reduce water usage by up to¬†**40%**¬†and cut household waste by¬†**30%**¬†annually.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid in Vertical Gardening**

Even seasoned gardeners make mistakes when setting up their vertical gardens. Here‚Äôs how to avoid the most common pitfalls:

**1. Overwatering or Underwatering**

* Vertical gardens¬†**drain faster**¬†than traditional gardens, leading to¬†**dry roots**¬†if not watered properly.
* Conversely, poor drainage can cause¬†**root rot**.
* üí°¬†**Tip:**¬†Use a¬†**moisture meter**¬†to track soil hydration levels.

**2. Ignoring Structural Support**

* Heavy planters or densely packed plants can¬†**damage weak walls or railings**.
* Ensure your support system can handle at least¬†**20‚Äì50 pounds per section**.

**3. Poor Plant Placement**

* Placing sun-loving plants in shady areas will¬†**stunt growth**.
* Shade-loving plants will¬†**wilt in direct sunlight**.
* **Solution:**¬†Group plants by their light and water needs.

**4. Neglecting Pests and Diseases**

* Overcrowded plants create a¬†**breeding ground for pests**¬†like aphids and spider mites.
* Conduct¬†**weekly inspections**¬†and introduce¬†**natural predators**¬†like ladybugs.

**5. Using the Wrong Soil**

* Garden soil is¬†**too dense**¬†for vertical planters, leading to¬†**poor drainage**.
* Use a¬†**lightweight potting mix**¬†with¬†**perlite or coconut coir**¬†for aeration.

**Expert Tips for a Thriving Vertical Garden**

üí°¬†**1. Rotate Crops Seasonally**

* Switch out plants every few months to prevent¬†**nutrient depletion**.
* Example: Grow¬†**lettuce and spinach in spring**¬†‚Üí¬†**tomatoes and peppers in summer**¬†‚Üí¬†**kale and broccoli in fall**.

üí°¬†**2. Incorporate Companion Planting**

* Some plants¬†**help each other thrive**¬†by deterring pests or improving soil health.
* Example:¬†**Marigolds**¬†naturally repel aphids, protecting¬†**vegetable plants**¬†nearby.

üí°¬†**3. Automate Irrigation for Low Maintenance**

* A¬†**self-watering system**¬†or¬†**drip irrigation**¬†can cut down watering time by¬†**50%**.
* **Smart planters**¬†can monitor moisture levels and notify you when watering is needed.

üí°¬†**4. Experiment with Vertical Hydroponics**

* Growing without soil can¬†**increase yield by 30‚Äì50%**¬†while using¬†**90% less water**¬†(NASA study, 2022).
* Best for¬†**strawberries, basil, lettuce, and peppers**.

**Final Thoughts**

A vertical garden is a fantastic way to bring nature into small spaces while maximizing productivity. Whether you‚Äôre growing fresh herbs for cooking, decorating with vibrant flowers, or cultivating a hydroponic vegetable garden, vertical gardening is an¬†**efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable**¬†solution.

But other than that my family ended up just messing up plans that I wanted to meet them for the first time. She's a person who's struggling to find a job and my family thinks I won't be safe with her at all. My friend is only a 2 hour drive away and I'm suffering massive anxiety to not disobey in a way and yes it's pathetic and I'm struggling to make a choice to go and getting my sister yelling and mother maybe disown me or stay and keep obeying and never meet my online friends till I move away.

Now here's the update, I have eventually hit my breaking point in November after my mother has gotten pissed off at me when I got home from overtime work on the weekend.  I didn't know my mom called so i missed her phone call i didn't call her back because i wanted time to get coffee and eat breakfast to wake up and calm down before imma get yelled at. My mother didn't know i was gonna do overtime but she had my life 360 location so she knows i go to work and get out of work. My mother really gets mad at me for not wanting to communicate with her for the miss call when i get home but also why I went to my family doctors to get a referral for a therapist. She was the reason im getting it in thw first place and than after she got fed up she got angry and decided to want to throw me out if we are not going to communicate or find a solution to all this. So i went to my bed room to shower and she followed me and blocked me trying to get out of my bedroom and from going to take a shower. I told her please i just want to take a shower and sleep after me waking up at 3 am and to get to work by 4 am and work till 11am. She gets more angry and said get my things and get out so i accepted at that point anf started to pack my things when she slams my door. She then comes back and said nevermind please talk to your sister i made a mistake of saying that to you i dont want you to leave. At that point i ignored her and continued to pack my things and when i finished i went to the front door and she processed to block me once more and said to not leave please i didn't mean it but to be honest i was over more of the back and forth stuff and left after she than let me go. After that I went to stay with my online friend and finally got to meet her and she's exactly as she was with me all the time when we played together with our groups and how we spoke to each other day and night. She took me in to stay with them over the holidays and new years when I didn't have anywhere else to go. My mother and family throughout the time first had constantly called telling me to come home saying she's sorry and telling me to speak with my sister which is someone I barely speak to because we also have communicating issues and just fight alot. Than processed to call my friend several different times and get other family members and family friends involved to constantly call my friend and harass her saying she would get into massive problems and cops would get involved. The weird part from this is that my family somehow had gotten my friends mother's phone number (for disclosure my friend helps to take care of her mother so she lives with her) and now constantly calls her number to get answers of my whereabouts and I had told them through text I do not want to talk to anyone i want my official space from all this drama and stress. The next day I thought everything might of died down a but cause the calls stopped but not I thought wrong. The police department for my town had been calling me several times now and my mom had tried to file a missings person report on me. I've told the cops several times im not missing im ok im not hurt and told the cops of where I'm at exactly but my mother does not take no for an answer. She is a very prosistant latina mother so she looks for several ways to get to me and try to snap me out of my so called mind controled state. They have came to my job, tried to use my niece as a way to speak with me, tried to sue me for my truck im paying off, tried to cut off my phone line and several other things which will be in part 2 coming soon.

Thats how I would describe Brad Pitt. Not me. But I‚Äôm working on it. My mom does call me handsome from time to time tho.

I‚Äôm John. And mostly bored. But also hopeful to find a fateful connection to chat with during the day. There is something slightly romantic about a random anonymous person connecting with you via DM that turns out to be awesome. Although it only happens once every 6 months or so it feels like haha.

I‚Äôm at work. I don‚Äôt like work. And due to my high productivity (brag brag) I have some free time. So I‚Äôm looking for someone awesome to chat with. 

Here are some of my basics:

I‚Äôm tall, I like working out and being healthy. I like my coffee black with a single spoonful of sugar that I stir for way too long like a crazy person. I‚Äôm trying to reduce caffeine but I can‚Äôt fight the curiosity to try all the cool new flavors of energy drinks that are out there. And protein powders. 

I‚Äôm big into staring at campfires until my problems burn away.

I love movies. And popcorn. Getting lost in a story is not necessarily an escape. But more of an adventure. 

I try to avoid too much alcohol but I do love me some sugary white girl vodka dranks. And I always take my first shot with my pinky out, in honor of Patrick from SpongeBob. 

I can‚Äôt take anything seriously. I make jokes about everything. I try to be kind and empathetic when I need to be, but I‚Äôm also incredibly dark and sarcastic all the time and think of jokes at funerals. But I hide this part of me from the general public so I don‚Äôt hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings haha. ‚ÄúJokes aside, there‚Äôs nothing left of me.‚Äù That quote is from me. But it looks better written as a quote. I‚Äôm a genius. But also an idiot sometimes.

I love good Standup comedy but absolutely abhor bad Standup comedy. It‚Äôs all in the writing. Not the delivery. That‚Äôs my controversial take haha. 

Please consider gracing my DMs with your presence if you:

-have a nice rack! (Jk).
-Love to laugh 
-Dark humor/dead inside 
-Don‚Äôt hate people for their different beliefs 
-Are awesome 
-Will pretend to laugh at my jokes

I know birthday blues are really common and that a lot of people feel this way on their birthday, but I am exhausted. 

For starters, i lost my dog if 10 years two months ago. I got her about 2 months before I turned 15. She wasn‚Äôt a family dog but my actual dog. we moved 13 times together, across multiple states, and she had been what was getting me through life. I hate being in my apartment without her, i hate going on food runs without her, I hate going on walks without her. I hate being an adult without her. Everyone in my life just keeps carrying on and I‚Äôm trapped in this grief that feels so suffocating. 4 days after losing her, I was laid off from my job which caused a series of events like almost having my utilities shut off, getting eviction notices, missing my car payment, etc. 

i have gotten a new job and am mostly caught up (yay for small victories!) but I am still feeling so hopeless and like i‚Äôll never come out of this. 

I want to pack and move, but when I try to talk about this with the people in my life i am not supported. They tell me that politics aren‚Äôt good there (i‚Äôve mentioned washington & florida because i want to be by the ocean) and have heard it about both places. I have been told i need to be logical, or asked ‚Äúwhy would you want to move there‚Äù. I am okay with making the choice regardless because it is what i want and i don‚Äôt need to explain it, but I would love some support with it. 

I also make sure I support all my friends and my mom even when I feel worried for them. I also plan for their birthdays and always go out of my way to celebrate them and do something small and heartfelt. No one reached out to make dinner plans, no one asked if I wanted to grab coffee, and I finally asked my mom if she‚Äôd have dinner with me 2 days ago. I get that everyone is busy with their lives and stuff but i just feel really lonely and I‚Äôm in a really dark and hard time so I was really hoping my community would show out for me.. 

i did take half a day off of work and am going to take myself into the city and get my hair done + get a special treat and am happy to have dinner with my mom, i just feel like i havent been thought of. 

also, I started talking to my ex again and he has reminded me why he is my ex, as we had plans for monday that got moved to tomorrow, and now he‚Äôs saying he can‚Äôt see me for a long time. He also managed to make me cry today, which would be the 4th birthday he has done that. I was really hesitant letting him back into my life, and he kept reaffirming that he wanted to be in my life so I feel angry at myself for allowing this to happen again.  

this is also the 4th birthday that I haven‚Äôt heard from my dad, since he ran off with a 20 year old girl he met at one of my halloween parties (he was there to hang a pi√±ata and I had thought he left but found him in a corner hanging out with her and now they‚Äôre engaged and he hasn‚Äôt spoken to my sister and I in over 4 years). 

I am just like can I catch a break or a breath at least? I know that life is hard and scary i just want some gentleness in my life. i want good friends and community and the chance to date decent humans. i don‚Äôt know where or how to find these connections and I feel like im stuck in this cycle which is making me so uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt know what to do with my life or how to get through today without having a total breakdown. ",2,1743003501.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False

I‚Äôm lying in bed after a long, tiring day. Had a coffee after work, then caught up with a friend‚Äîjust my way of unwinding when life feels heavy. My heart is happy, my soul is happy. But I won‚Äôt lie, lately, my mind has been clouded with thoughts‚Äîabout family, my career, and my future. Maybe it‚Äôs just my hormones acting up, or maybe it‚Äôs just one of those weeks.  

And right now, I find myself thinking about you.  

In these two years of being alone, I haven‚Äôt been in a romantic relationship. I‚Äôve tried opening my heart, even used dating apps, but mostly, I‚Äôve focused on my career and family.

Being alone has taught me a lot, shown me different sides of life I never paid attention to before.

Will we ever talk again? And if that happens, what kind of life will I be living? Will I have a family? Will I be lost? Or will I still be waiting‚Äîhoping‚Äîyou‚Äôd come back and tell me we can fix things? I don‚Äôt know. But I do know this: even now, I still feel you in my heart. And if you ever choose to return, my arms would still be open, without hesitation. I can picture it so clearly, and honestly, that thought alone makes me smile.  

Because when I had you, life felt whole.  

I‚Äôm happy now, but not in the way I was with you. And I wonder‚Äîdo you ever feel the same? Or are you happier without me? If you are, then I need to hear it. One last time. Not out of pain, but because I need to let go. I need to stop holding onto a door that might never open again.  

It won‚Äôt be easy. In fact, it‚Äôll hurt like hell. But if your happiness exists in a life without me, then this time, I‚Äôll let you go for good‚Ä¶",3,1743003132.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

He is a recovering alcoholic and has been through 'a lot', he has 3 kids from a previous marriage and now he has turned his life around, good job, own house and a long term GF (who is 14 years his junior) 

Hes 'good looking', her own words. When he was in his 20s he was a womanizer and has slept with the 3 other girls in her friend group. Bob was ostrasized from the group because some of these girls are now in LTR or married with other men in the friend group. 

2 years ago, my GFs husband at the time of 17 years passed away and Bob was her emotional  rock while she grieved (he was also her husbands best friend) and he has since become her 'closest non-sexual relationship' and she 'loves him to pieces'. Before meeting me she would talk on the phone with him 'every other day'. Now they just text and voice note each other and meet for coffee to 'catch up'. I haven't met him or spoken to him.

Despite this being a red flag. I dismissed it because she'd known him for a long time and if anything was going to happen it would have happend, plus he's in a relationship himself.

Very recently he's told her that his relationship is in trouble, and my GF has offered her support and been talking about meeting him for coffee. I'm not invited to these meetings, they usually occur when I'm sleeping after a night shift. I asked her some questions about him, to gauge the situaiton for myself and she picked up on the jealous vibe and said that it would be 'controlling' of me to make her feel uncomfortable about maintaining her friendship with him. She has always been a bit guarded about him, because I  think she knows that having such a close male friendship is pushing my trust to its limits and testing our relationship.

I don't think she is going to cheat on me, but what she is doing is borderline emotional cheating and I don't think I can cope with it mentally.
I know that if I try and set boundaries for her friendship with him she will resent me for it and it will inevitably end our relationship, and I'm trying to weed out my own insecurities which are playing a part in how I feel right now, which is awful.

Then, they did.

They cried when they saw me, held my hands like they never wanted to let go. My mother kept smoothing my hair, whispering through sobs about how I looked like her. My father kept saying how long they had searched. I believed them. I wanted to.

They told me I had a little brother.

His name was Alexander, and he was the sweetest kid I‚Äôd ever met. Even though he was small and fragile, he followed me everywhere. His small hand always slipping into mine. ‚ÄúEm,‚Äù he called me‚Äîmy first nickname.¬†

My parents were kind, too. Overly attentive, even. They insisted I move in with them, showered me with gifts, cooked elaborate meals just for me.

But there were rules.

No alcohol. No coffee. No soda. When I joked about celebrating our reunion with a drink, my mother‚Äôs expression turned cold so fast it startled me. ‚ÄúAlcohol damages the kidneys,‚Äù she said, voice clipped. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not good for you.‚Äù

No junk food. No processed foods. Everything I ate had to be fresh, steamed, herbal. At first, I thought it was just their way of making up for lost time‚Äîhovering, being protective.

Then there were the checkups.

I had never been to the doctor so often in my life. Blood tests, full-body examinations‚Äîmy parents insisted it was just to make sure I was healthy. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just worried,‚Äù my mother said, brushing my hair behind my ear.¬†

I told myself it was love.

Then one night, I woke up thirsty.

The house was silent as I padded to the kitchen.

Then I heard voices.

Low, urgent murmurs drifting from my parents‚Äô room. I moved closer, pressing myself against the door.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Last Fall an older gentleman came into my cafe and we got talking Chess. 

I had competed in the Borris Spassky Chess Invitational over 20 years ago and he mentioned to me that a roommate of his when he was in the military was a runner up to the Australian National Champion once, and had taught him all about Chess years ago. 

For a few weeks he would come in, and we would watch customers play Chess, and talk Chess ourselves. 

A month or so later, he came into the cafe and handed me a book; ‚ÄúNew York Times‚Äô Coverage of Bobby Fischer vs Borris Spassky: The Match of the century‚Äù. I was very moved by this gift. He told me he had thought of me, since I had played in the Spassky Invitational as a child. He said Chess had meant so much to him through his life and unfortunately his kids weren‚Äôt very interested in it. I remember he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to die and have my book pass to someone who doesn‚Äôt give a damn‚Äù. I replied, ‚ÄúI give a damn‚Äù. Though, it felt like I was speaking about more than just a Chess book. I asked if he would stay and said I wanted to give him a coffee, but he said he had to get on with his day.

I never saw him again.

Today a family came into the store with a stack of Chess books, and said that that man was their dad and granddad. Apparently he had passed away a few weeks after our last exchange. But before he had gone on he had told them about how much he had enjoyed talking Chess with me, and had told them to bring me all of his Chess books. I was floored. I didn‚Äôt even know his name, and he was speaking mine with some of his last words.

So now I have a stack of chess books at our cafe, and a newfound appreciation for Chess‚Äô ability to bring people together, over the board and around a table.

But mostly I am thankful for the opportunity everyday, for the chance to give a damn, and when you meet someone new, I hope you choose to as well.",58,1743002661.0,chess,11,0.97,False

Limerick is the largest town of the 3 and closest to Shannon airport of the 3

Newcastle west appears to be a medium sized town with activities and sights as well.

**Why This Pick?**

Boston is getting a number of players back from the injury report tonight ‚Äì while Jayson Tatum is now doubtful, Jaylen Brown, Kristaps Porzingis, Derrick White, Al Horford & Jrue Holiday have all been green lit to play this game. Comically, all of Boston‚Äôs injuries haven‚Äôt stopped them from winning games ‚Äì they‚Äôve won their last 6 straight and all by more than 5 points. Despite the Suns looking better over the last couple of weeks, they've been horrendous at covering the spread this season (second worst ATS record in the NBA...) and will be without Bradley Beal this evening. My money‚Äôs on Boston to cover on the road here, friends.

So, I know her from my workplace for a bit more than 1 year now. She's a pretty moody person, I've noticed that since the beggining, and I know she has a pretty rough past. 

She can be very happy at one moment and then change into a complete depressed state. I'm also a very emotional person so I understand that we can't always control what we feel and how we feel, so I'm usually very comprehensive with that as long as respect is preserved.

The thing is... Although I'm very emotional I try my best to not let that influence/hurt the people around me, even though I know sometimes I fail (by cancelling or changing plans, getting a bit distant when I need to process things, etc).

In contrary I've been noticing that when she's down she's starting to have the habbit of lashing out on me. It's not super obvious, but it's always stuff like:

* Not looking at me and avoiding normal conversations, basically being cold towards me
* Getting impacient with me because of little things (like taking too much time finishing something, taking a coffee, walking slowly, stuff like that)
* If she disagrees with something I say on a group conversation, she may use confrontational expressions like ""you're wrong"", or condescending ones like: ""ok, whatever"", ""you know best"", and not look at me in the eye. Then sometimes apologize for that later.
* She once avoided me for 2 months, and then apologize saying she was going through a hard time, although she behaved normally with everyone else for that entire time.
* If she gets angry to someone else during a group activity she still finds the opportunity to say something displeasing to me even though I have nothing to do with that. 

But still, when she needs to vent, an opinion, or to help her with something, she still reaches out to me, showing kindness and interest.

And when she is on extremely good mood, the roasts me ALL the time to get a laugh out of it. It used to be funny at the beggining but It's starting to get annoying.



Last straw was yesterday. She's part of my team, and she works everyday at the office while I work hybrid (which is 3 days remotely, 2 days at the office). 

I arrived and asked if everything was going well, and she responded with a soft but cold energy (as usual lately). Then after a minute she left for a meeting that was only planned the day before at the office (when I was working from home). The host forgot to post a notification online about this meeting, so there was no way hybrid people would know about this.

Although this is host's fault, I still feel kinda betrayed by her. She knew that I should also go to this meeting and she just left without telling me or inviting me. She could say she just ""forgot"", but I was talking to her a minute before.

  
I'm not sure about what to do about this friendship. She was never ""too"" confrontational or ""too"" rude. It's always something that I could blame on her lack of sensitivity instead of bad intentions. 

She has shown kindness when she's fine and she apologized a lot of times for her behavior. So I don't know anymore if she does this on purpose or if she doesn't know any better. I don't like to ""abandon"" people but I feel less and less empathy and desire to be near her.",1,1743002291.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs a 2016 GT with an automatic transmission. I‚Äôm coming here because this is my first time owning any sort of fast car, before this it‚Äôs been Mazda 3‚Äôs for the past 8 years. This car is an absolute dream of mine and I don‚Äôt want to end up a statistic because I don‚Äôt know how to drive the car. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I have absolutely zero intention of pushing this car to its limit on public roads, especially right out of the gate. I want to be prepared and go into it having as much knowledge as possible to prevent me from making an easy mistake for a first time owner. I know from looking online not to gas it around corners or when the wheel isn‚Äôt completely straight or else it will fishtail, also letting the tires warm up and not gunning it leaving cars and coffee. Any advice or things to look out for and practice would be greatly appreciated, I‚Äôm new to the car community and trying to learn all I can to stay safe and respect the cars power. Also before anyone says anything about driving it like an idiot I promise I have absolutely zero intentions of driving like your typical 23 year old with his first muscle car, I‚Äôve personally seen my best friend completely total 2 cars doing exactly that (a C5 corvette he put about 40,000 in mods in and his dads 2010 mustang GT) so I‚Äôm learning from his mistakes haha! I‚Äôm super excited to pickup this car on Saturday and take it for a spin even if I‚Äôm most likely going to drive it like a little old man. Also even though I know it‚Äôs a wildly stupid decision for a first time driver, I did buy the car with a lot of mods already on it from the previous owner. It has a roush supercharger with supporting mods and currently sits at 700hp (I know it‚Äôs stupid getting it like that right out of the gate but I do not intend to find out what it‚Äôs capable of anytime soon lol). My biggest concern is that I‚Äôm going to get in this car make a small mistake and not know how to correct it or what to look out for. I know for the most part I should be okay as long as I drive it conservatively and don‚Äôt go crazy thinking that my driving abilities somehow increased just by owning it but it‚Äôs better to be safe rather than sorry. Any tips, things to lookout for, things I should/need to practice, and stories from personal experience would be greatly appreciated!

1jke6wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jke6wn/heres_what_i_love_about_the_country_after_3_months/,Here's what I love about the country after 3 months,"I've spent the last ~3 months traveling through Vietnam as a digital nomad.

Hanoi -> Ta Van -> Quy Nhon -> Dalat -> HCMC

I've stayed at each place for 2-3 weeks. Had a phenomenal time overall.

To be clear: I don't come from a rich country. I'm from India so I don't find Vietnam to be cheap. The cost is the same as back home. Maybe a bit more expensive here because I know how to get good deals back home.

That said, here's what I love:

1. Amazing food. Fresh vegetables and suitable spice for my Indian palate
2. Probably the best coffee in the world. The variety and nuance of the different coffee from north to south is insane
3. Beautiful nature. A lot of it well maintained 
4. Good roads: this might come as a shocker but I've seen much worse roads
5. I only lived in non touristy areas. All the locals were always friendly and no one tried to scam me
6. Active people. I saw middle aged men and women indulging in football, volleyball, yoga, dance almost everywhere.

Here's what I think needs improvement. Both of these problems are seen in my country as well. This is not a comparison or derogatory post:

1. A lot of plastic use in daily life. I hope this is getting disposed properly by the government
2. The air pollution. The government needs to work on the air pollution as health care will only get more burdensome if the pollution continues


TLDR; love the country. Would love to come back sometime in the future. ",9,1743002182.0,VietNam,1,0.91,False
1jke5up,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jke5up/aitah_because_i_blew_up_over_my_husband/,"AITAH because I blew up over my husband ""misplacing one hat""","My husband has in my opinion a problem with being organized while I am pretty organized. He says his chaos works for him but the fact that he constantly loses and searches for things seems to prove him wrong. The deal is that he has 3 smaller areas in our home I won't touch and he can have as chaotic as he likes while he tries his best to keep the rest of the house organized.

Now there is in my eyes a reoccuring pattern which is important for the AITAH: He can't find his \[fill in item\] so he takes either my personal \[item\] or our common \[item\] instead and misplaces or loses it, too. When I need \[item\] it's gone and I can't find it. It usually turns up somewhere in his chaos but only after weeks or months when I already bought a new \[item\]. When \[item\] disappears he swears up and down he didn't take it and is all astonishment when it turns up in his stuff eventually. 

Those items are for example: 

* All of our to go coffee cups 
* All of our scissors 
* When we moved in together I had a neat tool box. It's empty now. If I need to screw something, I'm screwed.
* all of our plastic containers that have a reasonable lunch size. Countless times I wanted to pack some lunch for work and then there were only super tiny or large containers in our kitchen. 
* My scarfs 
* My woolen hats. I recently bought a new hat after he lost or ruined (stretched) all of mine. It's the only one I currently own and I especially asked him to not touch it. 

Now to the incident: 

It was warm for a while so I didn't wear my woolen hat. I took the opportunity to wash it and placed it where it belongs again. Fast forward it was cold and I wanted to wear my hat. It was gone. I asked him for it and he became all defensive because I ""always accuse him"" etc. This time I lost it, went to his pile of chaos in the bedroom and threw all his shit through the room until I found my hat in the middle of his stuff. It was clearly worn since I washed it so ofc he took it. It turned into a yelling match which is very unlikely for us.

My point: It's a reoccuring pattern, he doesn't even try to fix this habit, frustration builds up on my part. I want to live in my own home like a normal person and not being forced to lock or hide my stuff away from my own husband. 

His point: Those are isolated incidents (with sometimes months in between them so not like he does this every week) and circumstances are always completely different and I just do this - apparently - woman thing where the wife unearths every single mistake the husband made in the past to throw it at his face during a fight even if those have nothing to do with the current issue. It was only him misplacing a hat, not a ""problem with his character"" like I made it seem. 

So either I am the AH for blowing it out of proportion and linking events together that are not really related and therefore creating a ""reoccuring problem"" or he is TA for not seeing that those are not isolated incidents but a habitual problematic behaviour of his.

We randomly met in a Wildcraft store buying fleeced trousers for our respective trips, his to Jaipur and mine to Manali. We had an eye contact and he asked me how he looked in those trousers, I said meh, for which he laughed and later suggested we should perhaps bill our items together so we can avail the discount, the one that comes when you make certain amount. I agreed, we billed it on my name and number, which he still has, all blank. We ended up getting coffee on campus, we are from same university - surprise! And that night he messaged me on WhatsApp - 'thand lagegi boht, enjoy karle achi se'. I told him to enjoy his club tour too.

Many months into the story, he gave me his t-shirt before leaving the campus, he graduated before me, and wrote on one corner - With Love ‚ô°. All that love evaporated when he started his big job in Bangalore. Over time he just made me feel pathetic. I eventually didn't have it in me to tolerate any of it anymore and withdrew myself silently. He was so 'busy' he didn't even notice it.

Until many more months later, when the weather is just getting toasty, on one fine spring morning, he messaged he was waiting for me in my hostel lobby. Reluctantly I went, and said I can't when he asked me out for dinner, could see the disappointment on his face, he messaged The next morning about his departure, and then a few more days of failed correspondence.

Few days later, I had to install an air cooler in my room and the flooring got extremely messy. I opened my closet, took out a pair of scissors, and cut out the corner of a T Shirt that read - With Love ‚ô°, and proceeded to mop the floor with the remaining part of the clothing. The floor got very clean and even for a second I didn't even get reminded of those beautiful eyes that looked into mine all those months.

Hi baba, I hope you're doing fine. I'm writing this, hoping for your forgiveness. Remember gigi de lana songs?  I still watch and listen to her, but lately watching her hits different now because I have memories of us watching her together.

I'm sorry I was stubborn at inaaway kita lagi, Sorry na po, alam mo naman na galit lang ako pag ganyan ako, tao lang. lahat naman ng tao nakakaranas ng galit inis, hindi ko naman sinasadya. Nagka halo halo lang lahat ng pressure sakin that day at di ako nakapag isip ng tama. 

Dami ko gustong sabihin, ikwento, i feel like I was a kid that day na gustong gusto mag sumbong, wala akong makausap, at sayo ko lang naman gusto sabihin yung mga thoughts ko. Pero mali parin ako na nagalit ako sayo just because you're not available to talk.
I'm  sorry that we met in the situation where I'm trying to build myself and my career again, gusto ko naman talaga na palagi tayong magkasama, para hindi na kita inaaway pag di tayo nag cocommunicate, pero i realized na hindi ganun ang relationship, i have to trust you even at those times you're not available to talk. I should understand you and be calm.  And as for me, I'll be just here focusing on my new job. And as I planned.. I just need to work not only for myself but for us, gusto ko mag ipon, I also want to help provide for those things that might come in the future. Gusto ko kahit papano may maitulong din ako sayo in some things na hindi lahat palaging ikaw yung mag po provide ng kailangan natin.

I'm always thinking about you baba. I still want us to be together. if not now, maybe someday, hopefully. You said you don't easily give up dba? Let's try baba.
I'm praying and hoping you still love me because I do still love you the same. In fact, I love you even more kahit di ko alam how to show it to you. Please don't be in love with somebody else. Gusto ko ako lang. I tried to move on, and go on with my life but I feel empty. It feels like there's a void inside me that needs to be filled. My pride, my ego is telling me not to do this coz I don't wanna look desperate, this is so hard for me but my hearts says don't let go kase alam kong may kasalanan ako sayo at alam ko sa sarili ko na may dapat akong gawin para magka ayos pa tayo.

I hope you accept this flowers for my peace offering, for the Valentine's day that we didn't celebrate, for your birthday that I wish to come but I was too scared of you because I know you're mad. I wish to hug you again, kiss you and be with you. I hope you miss me din. kahit minsan nakakainis ako, I know.
I want to see you again baba. sorry na po talaga. I don't know if you're dating anyone since then. 
(sana wala) But I assure you, ako wala talaga.. pagod ako palagi sa work, wala ako gana mag socialize sa iba, natatakot ako makipag kilala ulit. ang gusto ko nalang talaga ayusin tong satin.

3 years ako walang anyone na naka date before kita nakilala, antagal ko naghintay but  I can still wait for you hanggang sa abot ng makakaya ko. I don't know how long will I be waiting, pero sana magkita tayo this month of April kase may 2 days ako na walang work schedule. April 18 and 19.

 Gusto ko sana umuwi sayo. You're my home, my love, my future wife. Pwede ako byahe ng April 17 after shift ko. Gusto ko lang makasama ka ulit. Let's go swimming baba, let's grill some fish and barbecue, that's fun dba? I miss cooking for you. I miss your laugh, I miss you snores at night, di ako magsasawa mag punas ng pawis mo sa gabi pag tulog ka because you sweat a lot. Kahit ganito lang ako simple, di marangya ang buhay.. mahal naman kita. magsusumikap ako para maging proud ka rin sakin. Pero kung di kapa ready sa ngayon maghihintay parin ako, we can go back to texting again, get know each other again, have some coffee sa labas pag day off ko. kahit ganun lang ulit. 

sorry na talaga please . Don't be mad forever. Alam kong wala akong magagawa kung talagang ayaw mo na sakin, wala akong choice kundi tanggapin nalang, kase kasalanan ko naman talaga masyado akong nag seek ng attention. Mali ako. Pero kung may magagawa pa ko para maging okay tayo ulit gagawin ko i promise. Sabihin mo lang sakin kung pano mo ako papatawarin.  Tell me how. Let me learn from you baba. Nagkatotoo na yata yung sinabi mo. 

""Always keep coming back on you"". 


In this world full of arrogance, independence, pride, and too much confidence, 
here I am, humbling myself. admitting the fact that I am not happy losing you. I can get by, but it's different now. I'm not the best, I know I am easy to be replaced, I know I don't have much to offer just myself and my love. But I promise you, I'll be more careful now.

I hardly ever get good sleep. I train middle distance triathlon and recovery is very important to my training, however sleep is a real let down for me. 

I use a garmin forerunner to track my activities, including sleep. I know activity trackers may not be the most specific, however I do feel my watch does give me a relatively accurate report of my sleep. I have no problem falling asleep, however it‚Äôs waking up during the night numerous times and tossing and turning to try get back to sleep is the problem. I am pretty sure I may have insomnia to some degree.

My sleep schedule does have vary daily due to working hours. Sometimes going from a late, into and early work shift, which only allows about 6 hours sleep, however sometimes I get better sleep scores on a 6 hour sleep than a longer uninterrupted sleep.

I would consider my anxiety and stress levels relatively normal. I don‚Äôt drink alcohol or smoke, and I don‚Äôt drink coffee or caffeine drinks. I have toyed with the idea of maybe trying prescribed sleeping medication, however I want that to be last resort.

Any tips or advice on how I may improve on my sleep?",1,1743001635.0,Garmin,1,1.0,False

\[PERSONALIZATION\]

I‚Äôm seeking representation for my 99,000 literary debut novel, I RUN FOR FREEDOM. This novel blends poetic introspection, dark humor, and biting cultural critique‚Äîperfect for readers of MY YEAR OF REST AND RELAXATION by Ottessa Moshfegh and LESSONS IN CHEMISTRY by Bonnie Garmus.

Every morning since her fourth back injury, Mona steps out of bed with her sciatic foot screaming murder, puts on her running shoes, and lies back down. Then she heads out to run‚Äîexcept, she can‚Äôt stop and stand. Not at a traffic light, not to fuel her life-sustaining coffee addiction.¬†

And yet, running helps.

Mind you, Mona can‚Äôt sit either. Especially not at work, where the academic hyenas have screamed abuse for decades‚Äîstripping her of her grant money, intellectual property, and dignity. Mona only joined the prestigious Carter University, Ivy League Territory, because her boss, Aayu, was like an academic godparent. But then Aayu‚Äôs replacement, Erdem, yells performance review requests into her inbox while she‚Äôs on medical leave.¬†

And so Mona runs. Escapes. Running helps.

Her only way to get tenure appears to involve ignoring her body, just like her parents taught her when no illness was ever bad enough‚Äînot even her life-threatening eating disorder. When she returns to work, Mona‚Äôs disabilities scream louder than the hyenas, louder than anything she‚Äôs ever heard.¬†

Will Mona run, the wind of freedom in her fire-red hair?

In sincere gratitude of your time,¬†

============

First 300:



The shrieks howl in my head.¬†

They‚Äôre from hyenas named academia, their sly sneers eating me alive.¬†

My escape? Outrunning them. I run marathons despite a back injury that grants me time away from their disdain.¬†

Oh, the irony.

\*\*\*

It‚Äôs October, the month that follows my summer of disability and pain. The month that follows the tears, the panic.¬†

A gut-punch email from my boss came in yesterday‚Äîthe latest hyena nip. It interrupted my sleep. It‚Äôs already a delicate process, considering I‚Äôm glued to my navy bedsheets thanks to my perimenopausal night sweats. But I peel myself off and rise from a few hours of dreamless worry, waddling into my teal-walled living room.

The email still echoes in my head. *We need to do your performance review*.¬†

Ah yes, I‚Äôm a professor at the prestigious Carter University, Ivy League territory. It doesn‚Äôt matter that I‚Äôm on medical leave, not to be contacted‚Äîin academia, no such thing matters, not to the hyenas. All that matters is performing. Publishing, not perishing‚Äîthough my body seems to have embraced the latter.

The dread sinks deep into my soul while I get ready for a run with my club.¬†

*Coffee. Shoes,* I think as I put on my socks. They‚Äôre extra tall for extra confidence. They‚Äôre also neon teal, seen from afar. You know, just in case a ship needs to navigate by my place on Roosevelt Island. I‚Äôm into colors y‚Äôall.

Pain radiates from my back as I stand in the elevator. But I‚Äôm never in pain enough not to try and run, to feel free, to fly towards the sunshine that‚Äôs this life.¬†

How do you follow up your international breakthrough album? By releasing a jazz cover album duh! I honestly didn‚Äôt know that this record even existed until I started doing this discography deep dive. The album‚Äôs promotion was mired by her famous appearance on SNL when she sang Bob Marely‚Äôs ‚ÄúWar‚Äù and tore up a picture of the pop while saying fight the real enemy. That act caused such an uproar that it irreparably damaged her career. In hindsight we can say she was right and we were the assholes.¬†

The album opens with ‚ÄúWhy Don‚Äôt We Do Right‚Äù , a song written by Kansas City Joe and made popular by Peggy Lee. It is known as the ultimate woman‚Äôs blues song. Sinead‚Äôs version feels upbeat and vibrant. ‚ÄúBewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered‚Äù comes from the Rodgers and Hart musical Pal Joey. sinead sounds so sultry on the song. ‚ÄúSecret Love‚Äù is from the 1953 Calamity Jane‚Äù it is this big energetic sound that Sinead handles so well. ‚ÄúBlack Coffee‚Äù is a jazz standard¬† written by Sonny Burke and Paul Francis Webber. I love the arrangement on this song and O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs voice sounds sensational. ‚ÄúSuccess Made a Failure Out Of Me‚Äù whos‚Äôs lyrics inspired the title of the album. You can tell Sinead‚Äôs emotional state by some of the song choices on the record. This is definitely my favorite track. It sounds so powerful in her vocal delivery and the arrangement. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Cry for Me Argentina‚Äù is perhaps the most well known cover on the album. Of course it's from the musical evita about the life of Eva Peron. It is a song about women empowerment that still resonates today.¬† ‚ÄúI Want To Be Loved By You‚Äù from the musical Good Boy made famous by Helen Kane who was the inspiration for the cartoon character Betty Boop. It is a banger of a big band tune. It just sounds so full and once again Sinead nails it vocally. ‚ÄúGloomy Sunday‚Äù also known as the Hungarian suicide song it was written by Hungarian piansit Rezso Seress. Sinead‚Äôs version is so sad and eerie it really sucks you into her despair. ‚ÄúLove Letters‚Äù is the bold jazz standard. Sinead‚Äôs voice sounds so lowkey and sultry. ‚ÄúHow Incentive‚Äù is a bossa nova jazz standard written by Brazilian composer Antonio¬† Carlos Jobim. It has such a nice pace delivered by the band. I really love Sinead's silky vocals. ‚ÄúScarlet Ribbons‚Äù has such a hollow and empty sound. The folk ballad has become a standard especially covered on many Christmas Albums. This version just feels so minimalist¬† but powerful at the same time. The album closes with a jazzy instrumental version of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Cry For Me Argentina‚Äù that includes a hidden track called ‚ÄúA Personal Message of Pain‚Äù that retells the biblical story of Jesus and the Money Changers.¬†

So a Sinead O‚ÄôConnor Jazz cover album wasn‚Äôt on my album listening card in 2025 but here we are. I did enjoy this more than I thought I was going to and Sinead once again hits her notes perfectly. I would put this on your bucket lists. It's a solid album of jazz standards. Also just remember Sinead was right about everything!

I've been on the vitamin D protocol since at least before the pandemic. I can't remember exactly when I started. 2019 seems good, but I remember it was definitely before 2020 because I was worried (read: terrified) Covid would make sourcing d3 and the cofactors difficult. 

The regimen worked so well that I don't even remember my last CH. I remember the last BAD one, of course, because during that nightmare motherfucker I thought my right eye had melted out of my skull and was dripping down my face. (It was just tears.) 

So I've had five or maybe more blissful years of total remission from CH. In all that time I've had a handful of days or moments where I feel ""shadowy"", which is what I call that weird not quite cluster but maybe one starting but the nerve feels kind of scorched feeling. Usually related to bad sleep or a scent trigger. Other than that, I thought my regular yearly cycles were over. 

Then I woke up Friday, May 21st at 5:45am with that shadowy feeling, only worse. I figured I slept on my neck wrong, as muscle tightness in my neck can sometimes lead to tension headaches. Tension headaches have NOTHING on CH but they're not fun all the same. I took some Sudafed, had two cups of coffee, and a warm shower. That cleared the shadowy feeling but I was unnerved. Too close for comfort. 

Then 10:15pm the next night that feeling of pain or something being wrong slipped into my dreams. I woke up and, like I used to at the beginning of a cycle, I was in disbelief and denial. It's like it hurts so bad and is so sudden I almost don't want to believe it's happening. I laid there for probably 15 minutes convinced I was dreaming, that this was a nightmare, trying to will it away. No such luck.

Thankfully I never tossed my old CH meds and had some sumatriptan injections left. I jabbed one into my thigh, felt that familiar warm tingle that makes my chest heavy, and waited for the pain to stop. 

Since then the pattern is establishing itself. Day 1, shadowy around 5:30am. Day 2, CH at 10:15pm - 10:45pm. Day 3, head feels a little scorched, but manageable. Then it repeats. I know this is weird to say but compared to some of my old cycles this one isn't that bad. The bad times don't come in the middle of the day when I'm with my kids and I get a mostly PF day in the middle. I once had a cycle that was 2 in one day, mid morning and mid-afternoon, and then a bad one the next day in the middle of the night to the point where I was scared to go to sleep. I was a zombie for two months on that kind of schedule. 

However, I am struggling to figure out what went wrong. I never missed a daily dose of the d3 regimen. Are you kidding me? I'd rather slam my hand in a door than miss one. 

My throat was a little sore and my sinuses a little congested. Could be a cold. It's the start of spring, so I wondered about allergies causing inflammation. But I've been through 5+ different spring seasons and God knows how many colds (even some bad ones) without relapsing. I've been eating low carb and had a cheat day on Friday. Maybe all the carbs caused a big inflammation response? I know having your GI shoot up is inflammatory. But a lot of the sites recommend eating keto to help with CH. (No idea if that works or how well or is just more snake oil.)

You all probably know the feeling, might as well be casting runes or reading tea leaves trying to figure out wtf went wrong. I've been upping my D3 dose, adding some extra vitamin C, and have the antihistamine full Monty on order.

I guess my question is, has anyone else had this experience? Or something similar? Where the regimen worked for years and then it didn't? If so, did you ever find anything that worked? Please tell me you found something that worked.",3,1743000744.0,clusterheads,1,1.0,False

Mark? The name scratched at the back of my mind, an itch I couldn't quite scratch. ""Who's Mark?"" I texted back, a flicker of confusion igniting in my chest.

The reply was instant. ""Don't be silly! Mark, you know, your‚Ä¶ practically brother! You've known him since you were a kid! Don't tell me you forgot!"" She even threw in a laughing emoji, as if this was some grand joke.

But it wasn't a joke. I didn't know Mark. Not even a shard of recognition glimmered in my mind. ""Mom, I'm serious,"" I typed back, my fingers shaking a little. ""I don't know who Mark is. I've never met anyone by that name.""

She didn't answer.

Panic scratched at my throat. I sprinted to the bookshelf, yanking out photo albums, their covers cracked and worn. Birthday parties, Christmas mornings, school graduations ‚Äì the milestones of my life in grainy photographs. And there he was. Mark. A steady figure, a smiling face in the periphery of every milestone. He was tossing a football with me at my tenth birthday, shoulder-to-shoulder with my sister at my high school graduation, even raising a glass at my 21st birthday party. He was everywhere.

But I didn't remember him at all.

Desperate, I moved. I took my keys, a sense of panic driving me in circles in my mind. My sister. She'll remember. My best friend. They'll recognize that this is not right.

My sister, Sarah, opened the door, smiling brightly. ""Hey! Mark's birthday now?""

The words struck me as if I had been physically hit. I felt my head reel.

""Sarah, who is Mark?"" I begged, my voice hoarse with fear. ""I've never met him! This doesn't make any sense at all!""

She looked at me, her smile wavering. ""What are you talking about? Mark's‚Ä¶ Mark! He's been here forever. Don't you recall all the summers we spent at his family's lake house? The time he rescued you from the pool when you were going to drown?""

I shook my head, my eyes welling up with tears. ""No! None of that ever happened! I don't remember any of it!""

I stared at my good friend Chloe, hoping and praying she'd explain to me that Sarah was joking, playing some vicious trick on me. Chloe merely gave me a blend of concern and puzzlement, though. ""Do you okay? You've seemed really out-of-it today. Of course you know Mark. He's pretty much part of the family.

We stuffed into Chloe's car, Sarah and I in the back, Chloe behind the wheel, the silence heavy with unasked questions. My head spun, attempting to get a handle on what was occurring. Closing my eyes, I struggled to remember my childhood, to find some shred of evidence that Mark was ever in my past.

Nothing.

Then, a flicker. A burst of images, broken and confusing. Me laughing with Mark, keeping secrets beneath a starry night sky, walking hand in hand‚Ä¶ memories that weren't my own, memories being implanted, jammed into my mind. It was as if I was seeing a warped movie reel, pieces of another life I'd never lived imposed on the life I knew. A tide of sickness spilled over me. I gasped, grabbing at my head, the implanted memories threatening to engulf me.

We got to Mom's place. I stumbled out of the vehicle, my legs leaden. I needed evidence. I needed to discover something, anything, that would validate that I wasn't losing my mind.

I rushed to my former bedroom, dodging Mom's cries, and furiously started up my computer. Emails, texts, Facebook ‚Äì I needed to dig into every digital aspect of my existence for proof that I was not insane.

And there it was. Years-old emails from Mark. Facebook messages with those inside jokes. Photographs with his name. I had responded to his messages, sent multiple emails, engaged with him online as if he were a permanent figure in my life.

But I couldn't recall any of them.

My mother shouted out, ""Dinner's ready!"" Her voice sounded abnormally cheerful, almost.forced.

I came out of my room, my heart racing against my ribcage, a chill of fear in my belly. And that's when I saw him.

He was in the living room, standing beside my mother, his arm slung carelessly around her shoulder. Mark.

He wasn't what I imagined. Not ugly, not terrifying. Just. normal. Average height, brown hair, forgettable features. He resembled the kind of person you'd pass on the sidewalk and never give a second glance. And yet, his presence dominated the room with an overbearing weight, a crushing feeling of wrongness.

His gaze met mine, and a slow, creepy smile crossed his face. It wasn't a welcoming smile. It was a smile that knew something I didn't know, a smile that threatened something awful was going to occur. It was the smile of a predator.

A shock. A shivering breath. I awoke. 3:17 AM. Again.

Sweating, I sat upright in bed, my heart pounding against my ribcage. This time, the giggle wasn't a distant whisper. It was. nearer. More tangible.

My phone beeped. Mom again. ""Don't forget Mark's birthday dinner tonight! He's really looking forward to seeing you.""

The message was the same. Word for word.

I hurled the phone across the room, a strangled cry escaping my mouth. It was happening again. This was not a dream. This was real.

I got out of bed, clamoring for something that would ground me in the real world. I glanced at my room, hoping for something, anything, that would attest to the fact that I wasn't going crazy. My eyes landed on a framed photo on my dresser. It was one of my dad and me, taken when I was a child. I hadn't seen it in years.

Except. it wasn't just my dad and me anymore.

By my dad's side, his arm slung over my shoulder, was Mark. The same bland face, the same creepy smile. He had taken my father's place in my own mind.

I could feel a scream rising in my throat, a raw howl of rage and terror. My memories were being stolen from me, rewritten, replaced with this. this thing.

I sprinted to the mirror, gazing into my reflection, searching for any indication that I was indeed myself. A few seconds passed before the edges of my reflection's mouth twisted into that same unnerving smile. It leaned in and said softly, ""You're ready, kiddo.""

The voice was mine, yet it wasn't me.

I slammed the door closed and I ran, pushing open my bedroom door. Mark was there, leaning against the doorframe, arms crossed, that awful grin on his face.

""Why are you doing this?"" I gritted out, my voice shaking. ""What do you want?""

He merely laughed, that low, queasy sound. ""I'm not doing anything,"" he told me, speaking in a low, strangely calm voice. ""You're always doing this.""

He grasped my arm, his hold much stronger than I expected, and steered me toward‚Ä¶ my aunt Mina's. It had been years since I'd last seen her. Why would he want to see her?

""I want to go inside with you,"" he murmured into my ear. I barely heard him.

We arrived at Mina's house. There was a frantic hope that leapt within me. Perhaps she knew. Perhaps she remembered the world as it ought to be, the world before Mark.

I ran up to the door, knocking frantically until Mina opened it, her eyes opening wide with shock.

""What are you doing here?"" she asked, fear creeping into her voice. ""You shouldn't have come.""

""Mina, please,"" I pleaded, grasping her hands. ""You have to assist me. I don't know what is occurring. My memories‚Ä¶ they're being altered. There is this man, Mark, he is taking the place of everyone I know. He's--""

Mina stepped back, her face twisted in terror. ""They're going to make you right,"" she breathed, her eyes flicking towards Mark, who stood behind me, his eyes following me with the same knowing grin. ""They want to make you right before. before they wipe you out.""

""Wipe me out?"" I breathed, my blood congealing in my veins. ""What do you mean? Wipe me out of what?""

Mina paused, her eyes shining with a desperate, entreating expression. ""You're not the first,"" she whispered. ""There was one before you. And they'll do it again. They'll replace you, the way they replaced her.""

Another me? Replaced? My head spun, attempting to follow through the urgency of her words. I was a replacement? For another person?

I parted my lips to speak to her further, to require answers, but then. it occurred.

Mina's eyes turned glassy, her muscles locked up, and her face blanked out. Her pupils expanded, her eyes losing all familiarity. It was as if a switch had been thrown, removing everything that made her. her.

""Mina?"" I whispered, gently shaking her. ""Mina, can you hear me?""

She blinked, her eyes now vacant and clear. ""Oh, hey,"" she said, her voice now cheerful and light, as if nothing was amiss. ""What are you doing here?""

She remembered nothing. She remembered no conversation. She remembered no fear in her eyes. She remembered no warning she had just issued me.

She had been erased.

Mark moved towards me, putting a hand on my shoulder. ""See?"" he whispered, his voice soothing and gentle. ""I told you, you're always doing this.""

""Do what?"" I breathed, my voice breaking. ""What am I doing?""

He grinned, a slow, predatory smile that made me shiver. ""You always forget.""

1jkdlm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/1jkdlm8/jobs_of_my_dreams_isare_chipping_away_at_my_sanity/,Job(s) of my dreams is/are chipping away at my sanity,"Graduated Law School, did a Masters but ultimately chose not to pursue a career in this field, slowly finding out about the bad work culture, colleagues that only pursue toxic and infinite financial growth, disproportionate power structures within work environments, trauma-ridden and abusive bosses. 

So over 6 months ago I found a job as a barista in a local coffee shop. For three months it went great, it was exhausting but it was fun work, with great people and overall I felt very comfortable in that environment. 3 months into this job, the NGO where I've been volunteering for the past few years (fighting illegal evictions, promoting renters' rights, social housing and more), that I help with legal counseling, offered me a part-time WFH position. So I took the offer, 20 hours/week WFH, and also transferred my contract at the coffee shop to a 20 hours/week as well. In total 40 hours per week, 20 physical work in a social environment, 20 from home doing office and research work. 

What more could I want, right? A job where I'm genuinely enjoying my time, and a job doing self-fulfilling, meaningful work for the community that can change the lives of others for the better! I won't get into too much details of the work, but it's very specific, as I live in a Eastern-Bloc country where the sudden mass privatization of housing (that was all *public* before) has caused some really intricate problems.

It's just that over these past few months, I've had multiple issues with the WFH NGO job that kinda ruin me: 

1. Working from home (and also living in a small studio) means I've started to feel that the workspace and personal comfortable space have started intertwining. Doesn't help that I use my personal laptop for it either.

2. Having no fixed schedule I feel like there is no separation between work time and me-time, especially because things can pop up at any minute of the day. I've been called/messaged at both 7AM in the morning when I'm sleeping or at 23:00/midnight. My colleagues don't have fixed schedules either and thus we we're always at work. 

3. Point 2 really ties into point 3, as sometimes we get contacted/try to help really urgent cases. This week I've kinda been a wreck because we kept getting contacted by people being evicted, some with mental health issues, general health problems, children or elderly involved, etc. Receiving such a message at 22:00 triggered a huge anxiety attack that lasted me all week. We can't always help these people because we're only a handful of people, we mostly try to do advocacy and systemic work rather than helping individual cases because it's often too much to handle. 

4. I kinda feel like I'm an impostor here, just \`stealing\` their money. They don't have a lot of resources (everyone here has either a full-time, part-time job, or just volunteers). The people running the NGO are really disorganized, and have no legal experience (that's why they hired me), but this being my first job in this field I have no clue on how to tackle some problems sometimes.  I don't have anyone to ask either, and often I just give up before trying, or sometimes I can't wrap my head around solutions at all. So, some days/weeks I've worked less than the required 20 hours. I guess they've been satisfied with my work so far, but I certainly am not, I feel directionless and confused most of the time, draining me further. If I knew what to do specifically, I'd be able to get so much more out of my time. 

Sorry for writing such a long text, it's such a hard dilemma I've been face with. Was either thinking of resigning from my \`job\` and just staying a volunteer here, or quitqng altogether. People around me don't understand why I'd want to quit, because I'm getting paid for not a lot of work, that's from home as well, with people that I've known for years and are really understanding, but I feel I can't take it anymore. I just wanted to find a job that allowed me to live, and simply at that, to be able to find myself and to enjoy things. Can it be that I'm just not cut for it?

I am sorry if this is rambling.  My grammar and spelling are poor but did not run this through predictive text because everyone hates it apparently.

Background information that should be treated as immutable fact that can not be argued. Me and my wife have be together for almost nine years but have known each other for almost twenty five years. My wife and I love each other. No one is cheating. I am already in therapy thank you very much, but do to unrelated circumstances have not been able to talk to my therapist. This is not a accurate representation of our relationship, it is an outlier.  I will not leave my wife. I bring a glass of ice water to bed every night because my wife sometimes gets thirsty. If there is no good solution I will suck this up, never mention it again and still spend the rest of my life in a happy marriage. We were drinking. I had one and a half drinks and switched to cola when the incident occurred. I do not know how many she had. Our relationship has only gotten better over time.

Subjective information.  Both my wife and I have had abusive relationships in our past. Her‚Äôs are way worse then mine. She has had to deal with sexual assault, domestic violence, drug addiction, alcoholism, and while not malicious, I would call a man so pathetic, he drug her down with him for years. This is not on person. I am her best relationship but I don‚Äôt have strong competition.

There has been one act of domestic violence in our relationship. It was at the start of our relationship. While fighting she hit me. It did not hurt and quite frankly I was more confused then mad at the moment. I stopped the fight (something I can not do normally) and told her that if she ever hits me again I will leave her. It has never happen again. We talked about it and in a gut wrenching revelation she ‚Äújust thought that‚Äôs how relationships go‚Äù. On thre other occasions while arguing she has said something along the lines of ‚Äúgo ahead and hit me‚Äù. Each time I have explained that I will never do that. Again, low bar.

So what actually happened. In the middle of the night my wife wakes me up and ask me to taste her water. It tasted like flat water that had been siting out to me. She said it tasted like old milk. In all honesty there is a small but unlikely chance that I used tap water and not filtered as I drank tap water my whole life and sometimes don‚Äôt think about it.  My wife sense of tast and smell are also notably better then mine. I say that‚Äôs weired and go back to sleep.

The next day, after work me and my wife got in an argument. She was doing a thing she dose were she gets angry about something she cant actually change, cant get over it and then goes around looking for other things to get angry at, like me. And in reaction I wstarted acting like a little passive aggressive bitch. Not technically doing anything wrong, but doing all the right things while giving off attitude. I should not have done that, I am working on it.

 In the middle of the fight, she asks If I had poisoned her. I stope and question what she meant by that. Her answers were, yes she is really asking that, no she dose not think I was trying to kill her, and maybe I was trying to fuck with her for some disagreement I don‚Äôt even remember.  

Then I did all the cliche reddit things. I actually felt like I was punched in the gut. I immediately stopped arguing and acted like everything was OK. Twice I excused my self because I was going to cry (I am not a crier, no shame if you are, it is just not how I express sadness usually.). Then went to bed like nothing was wrong. My wife knew soothing was wrong because she can read me like a book.

 So this all happen a while ago. And it has kind of shook me. I know its miner but, I trust her completely. The fact that she thinks that I could do something intentionally and cowardly hurts. That that is how she sees me.

If my wife brought me a coffee mug of orange juice and Draino, I would say ‚Äúobviously this is one of those one in a million accidents‚Äù. If you the said ‚Äúthere is a child profe cap on the Draino and it is stored on a different floor then the OJ, I would say that obviously one of my enemy snuck in a tried to poison me.  And if you said ‚Äúthe alarm was on and all the door were locked from the inside, I would say obviously you tried to poison me and frame my wife prepare to fight.

Sorry that I am long winded and rambling. But I need to talk to my wife about this. But I need to find a way that is not accusatory or coming off aggressive. I really hope she dose not actually see me that way. The best case senareo I can think of is her telling me that she did not mean it and was just trying to hurt my feelings. As fucked up as that is.

How do I start this conversation?

1jkdjp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1jkdjp7/birthday_gift_idea_for_good_friend_going_through/,Birthday gift idea for good friend going through hell?,"Hi all, 
My friend who has mental health issues and is a recovering alcoholic (sober for....gosh, must be getting up to 7 years now!) is in the middle.of a really, really rough patch. It was her birthday a week ago, and our other mutual friend and I sent her a group message saying we wanted to take her out for dinner. She never replied until last night when she admitted she's struggling these days. She's also an o my child, and caring her high-needs elderly parent who really should just be in a home (I'm doing the same thing, so I get it.) 

I have a few small items I'd already picked up for her - we never do huge gifts - but I'd love to bring her something just to show her some support. Should we just make a meal for her & her family and drop it off? We live in a semi-rural area, and while  take out options exist in the towns near us, delivery doesn't. So then do we do gift cards for meals? 

She laughs about her ""black thumb"" but does love plants and flowers. She does seem to forget to water them, though. It's still winter here, but should I hold off on the bigger gift and just plant a few planters for her front porch when the weather warms up? 

She is definitely in retreat mode right now, and is not a spa girl - we all live in the country for a reason. This is our retreat. 

Would love to hear what gifts you've given or received during intense struggles in your life. 

Adding on: she has a wicked sense of twisted humor. Likely why we get along so well. Also helps her deal with her extremely stressful job & past trauma. She does love candles, the smelling (but in a good way) the better. Loves to read (escape), true crime podcast listener, loves her kid and her dogs, and probably her husband, too üòâ  , coffee and tea, into ""the occult""/paganism/witchy stuff/crystals, etc. We are both in our late 40s now, she's a year older than me, almost 10 years older than our other friend in this specific group.

1jkdgjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Belize/comments/1jkdgjo/12_day_family_trip_report_march_2025/,12 day Family Trip report - March 2025,"We are a family of 2 adults and 2 teens from New England and were looking for a nice mix of adventure and relaxation.

We arrived at BZE at 1:30pm on Monday, March 10th. Immigration was quick and easy with the online declaration form. Several groups who did the physical form were sent back to correct or complete their form, so I recommend doing it ahead of time!

We had no bags to collect, so we were out of there in 15 minutes and across the parking lot to get our rental from Hertz. Quick and easy, we hopped into our very cool Isuzu 4WD SUV and found our way to the Belize Zoo for our first stop.

Our first night was spent at the Tropical Education Center at the Belize Zoo. We stayed in Pond House 2 which was a large cabin with 1 queen, 1 double and 2 single beds. A small bathroom, basic kitchen and screen-in porch with hammock completed the glamping adventure. It was very warm that night, but the fans kept us cool. They provided fresh, purified water for drinking in the room, as well as dinner and breakfast while staying there. The food was surprisingly good! Dinner was roasted chicken with mashed potatoes, salad and cake for dessert. Breakfast was traditional Belizean eggs with chaya (like spinach), fry-jacks, beans, fruit, and plenty of coffee. We were asked for dietary restrictions beforehand, which were accommodated. Kids spent time in the refreshing pool, exploring the leaf-cutter ants and star-gazing. In the morning, Juan Carlos gave us an impromptu birding guided tour around the property which was amazing for our family! He was so knowledgeable! After check-out, we headed to the zoo (we missed the night tour as it began to rain).

The Belize Zoo was fantastic. I‚Äôm an ecology educator and am often wary of zoos, but they absolutely get it right. Lots of excellent information on conservation of the endemic species that call the zoo their home. Large, natural enclosures that offer good viewing and animal comfort. Loved that every creature there is rescued and not part of a breeding program (which aren‚Äôt inherently terrible but can be problematic). We spent far more time there than expected, had lunch and then spent another hour! Highly recommended for any animal lover - especially those who desire seeing more elusive species that are unlikely to find on a hike.

Next we drove on to Hopkins. The roads were in good shape, well signed and full of the famous speed bumps I was warmed about! We arrived at Seiri del Mar, which would be home for the next 5 nights. Located in north Hopkins, this new and quiet resort was perfect for our family. Walkable to restaurants in town, but away from the busyness, it was clean and comfortable for us. They have a lovely pool, lots of toys and games, hammocks on the beach as well as kayaks and paddleboards.¬†

Unfortunately, my youngest came down with a stomach bug for the first couple of days so I didn‚Äôt venture out much. My partner and older child took advantage of the time to conquer Antelope Waterfall at Mayflower Bocawina National Park and do some birding. I booked us a special birding tour with Celso Sho of Red Macaw Paradise in Red Bank Village. We were treated to the end of the macaw season here, but plenty to view! Definitely an experience of a lifetime!

Once my younger kiddo was feeling better we drove over to Cockscombe Basin Wildlife Sanctuary for river tubing, which was a comfortable 1 hour ride. It was a bit shallow but the water was clear and calm, making for a relaxing experience. We then did another 45 minute easy hike before heading back to Seiri del Mar. Our final full day we did a half day snorkel trip with Get to Know Belize Adventures with Captain Medz and guide Alden. We spent time at Salt Caye and Tobacco Caye, seeing dozens of fish, rays and even a manatee. I don‚Äôt do well on boats, but the morning water is flat and the boat ride was easy. Our guides were patient with our kids, and knowledgeable about the reef system. On the way back, we stopped at a mangrove island inhabited by hundreds of Frigate birds! It was an incredible sight to see the males on display as it was the beginning of nesting season. Definitely a highlight for our family.¬†

The day we left Hopkins was also the day of the district-wide power outage. Our resort had generators, but we had originally planned to eat breakfast out on our check out day and the hotel restaurant doesn‚Äôt serve breakfast. Independent cafes were closed for the day so we just ate some toast we had left in our room and aimed for an early lunch at our next destination - Sleeping Giant! The drive along Hummingbird Highway is as lovely as everyone says.¬†

We arrived at The Rainforest Lodge at Sleeping Giant on the hottest day of our trip - 97F - and being in a different district meant they had power. But, none of their common spaces have AC and our room wasn‚Äôt ready yet so we camped out at the pool and had lunch to kill the time. It was too hot for us to do anything else. The resort is beautiful. The grounds and property are amazing. The food is some of the best we had on the trip. We only stayed one night and never left the grounds because it was truly spectacular. You are truly in the jungle! There is NO cell reception and the WiFi is spotty. We loved that it was so secluded and walked much of the property, did the rope bridges, climbed the nest and saw over 100 species of birds in 24 hours. We had hoped to go horseback-riding in the morning but it was pouring rain.¬†

Upon leaving Sleeping Giant, we stopped at St. Herman‚Äôs Blue Hole and Cave. Because of the rain, we weren‚Äôt wanting to swim but the Blue Hole was pretty! The Cave was really interesting and an easy walk in and out. I think we‚Äôre just not super into caves, though.¬†

Our final stop was a 4 night stay at Mariposa Jungle Lodge near San Antonio, about 30 minutes south of San Ignacio. We just loved it here! Small, intimate and truly in the middle of the jungle, it was just a slice of heaven. Their property boasts a bird tower and several nature trails teeming with wildlife. We had toucans, coatis and hummingbirds hang out with us on our deck. We stayed in the Blue Morpho cabana which had 2 bedrooms, a full bath, full kitchen, AC and a lovely deck. Very comfortable for our family! We had all our breakfasts and most dinners there - the food was excellent. Some of the best food we had in Belize. Highly recommended!

Our first full day here we spent at Xunantunich and Cahal Pech, both of which we enjoyed. We were lucky to be visited by Spider Monkeys at Xunantunich and the ferry is such a unique experience! Our kids actually preferred Cahal Pech because there were more tunnels and rooms to explore. Really excellent experience.¬†

The next day we went Ziplining with Calico Jack‚Äôs - loved this! Felt super safe - they were serious about safety every step of the way. We had two guides for 4 people and 9 different ziplines - some of which were crazy long! Our guides were incredibly generous, taking video and photos to send to us of the experience. It was a super fun morning. That afternoon we visited the Green Hills Butterfly Ranch and the Belize Botanic Gardens. The Butterfly Ranch takes you on a 45 minute tour of their different butterfly and caterpillar houses. I really love this stuff, so it was especially interesting to me to see all the different host plants and caterpillar phases. The guides were so kind and passionate about Belizean butterfly conservation. And then there were the hummingbirds! Dozens and dozens of them! I‚Äôve never seen anything like it and we were captivated. The Belize Botanic Gardens were equally stunning and informative, but the drive there was rough! The 4 mile road off the highway was really rough and took longer than we expected so we had less time at the gardens than we had hoped. Still worth seeing, though.

Our last full day was spent exploring Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve. We first hiked down to Big Rock Falls which was stunning! Lots of stairs, but worth it. We had so much fun jumping into the falls and swimming around. Afterwards, we drove on to Rio on Pools which was a much easier walk and offered a very relaxing experience. Lots of locals having a picnic or just relaxing in the cool water. It was a really lovely way to end our trip.¬†

A few things we learned:

* Didn‚Äôt need much cash. Most places we went we could pay by card.¬†
* Folks say ‚ÄúGood night‚Äù as a greeting in the evening, which took a minute to get used to
* We brought loads of bug spray and still got completely eaten up. But only the girls in our group. My theory is the biting bugs don‚Äôt like hairy legs.
* Wildlife is everywhere! This is just amazing and a feast for your eyes and ears!
* House geckos are LOUD! Nearly every place we stayed had a resident House gecko in it at some point and they have this chirping at night which can be very loud.
* Check your shoes, clothes and sheets for spiders and scorpions. We had 2 scorpion sightings (luckily both outside our room) and a few spiders. Just shake out your things to be safe.
* Belizeans are incredibly warm and generous people. ",3,1743000293.0,Belize,2,1.0,False

Howdy! My name is Trevor I am a recent applied Mathematics graduate in Texas. Currently in search of something for my field while I work at a coffee shop. For those interested, I am an INTJ. For those not, in other words I then to be pretty introverted.

About me:

I am a very straight forward person who enjoys things being clear. Improving at things and doing things efficiently is something I really enjoy doing. I am a very honest person and a very open person once I know someone for a bit. I will answer almost all questions someone asks about me. I have a somewhat dry/sarcastic/witty sense of humor and I enjoy some dark humor.

I am very much a nerd (as shown by my major). My hobbies include building, painting, and playing Warhammer 40k. I also enjoy gaming (mainly PC). My favorite game series is monster hunter. Recently I have been playing marvel rivals, Minecraft and monster hunter wilds.

My favorite music is 2000s/alt rock like breaking benjamin, sleep token, and three days grace. But enjoy lots of different genres. Except country.

I enjoy reading fantasy and sci-fi books. I recently got done with the abolethic sovereignty novels and really loved it.

I am not religious and have no intention of being religious. I am left leaning and am not interested in people who are right leaning because our values are very different. 
 
I work out semi regularly at home. Mostly calisthenics: pull ups, push ups, sit ups, ...


Some things I am looking for:

   You are between 22-28 and are in the US. Preferably close to Texas but not required.
   Someone interested in getting to know each other first to figure out if we are compatible.
   Someone kind and honest.
   Someone who is willing to be communicative. I'm not the best at reading signs. (Or mindreading for that matter :))
   We do not have to have some of the same hobbies, (or any at all) but its important that you can appreciate/respect mine as I will do the same with yours.

The truth is far more nuanced than the Instagram ads suggest: while certain herbal ingredients like dandelion root, ginger, and peppermint can genuinely help with bloating and water retention without the violent bathroom emergencies, many commercial detox teas rely on harsh senna leaf that creates only temporary weight loss through dehydration‚Äîoften with painful cramping as a bonus.

Through this journey of personal trial-and-error (and yes, some regrettable bathroom experiences), I've identified which popular brands actually provide gentle cleansing benefits versus those that simply punish your digestive system, what ingredients to look for versus red flags to avoid, and how to incorporate these teas into a sustainable approach to wellness rather than expecting miracle results from what is, at the end of the day, just flavored water with some beneficial plant compounds.

## Benefits of Detox Teas

These teas aren‚Äôt just trendy‚Äîthey actually come with a range of potential benefits, especially when the ingredients are backed by science. Here are a few reasons why you might want to try them:

1. **Improved Digestion**: Many detox teas contain ingredients like **ginger** and **peppermint**, which help soothe the stomach and promote better digestion. Prebiotic-rich powder supplements, like those with **inulin** or **Xylooligosaccharides (XOS)**, can also nourish the good bacteria in your gut, reducing bloating and discomfort.
2. **Natural Detox Support**: Your liver and kidneys are already great at detoxing on their own, but teas with **dandelion**, **burdock root**, or **green tea** can give these organs an extra boost. These ingredients act as gentle cleansers, supporting your body‚Äôs natural processes.
3. **Weight Management**: Some detox teas include ingredients like **green tea** or **oolong tea**, which are known for their metabolism-boosting properties. If your goal is to shed a few pounds or maintain your current weight, these teas can be a helpful addition. Just remember‚Äîthey‚Äôre not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle.
4. **Reduced Bloating**: We all are aware‚Äîbloating sucks. If you‚Äôve been feeling heavy or puffy, teas with natural diuretics like **parsley** or **lemongrass** can help flush out excess water and make you feel lighter.
5. **Antioxidant Boost**: Detox teas are often packed with antioxidants, which fight off harmful free radicals in your body. This means they can help you look and feel better by reducing oxidative stress, which can lead to inflammation and aging.

Fairly active (work out 2-3x/week) for 20 years+. Good diet aside from an addiction to all things chocolate. I had afib originally in 2012. First occasion corrected itself before I was seen in the hospital. Second occurrence happened at son‚Äôs bday and I think it a was a caused by a combination of alcohol and coffee (had a morning coffee, 2 maybe 3 beers max at the cookout and my afternoon coffee when I noticed my heart racing and out of rhythm). This time they caught it in the ER. It took my heart almost 1 week to come back to sinus through medication. Fast forward 12 years-I became neurotic about my heart. Every time I felt a slight pain or discomfort I would go to the doctor. As a result I have had a million of tests done with no issues ever found aside from possible GERD causing benign chest pain. I‚Äôve had stress tests with and without contrast, ecg, and ekgs. This past February I had another episode occur during a workout. (Previously it occurred while at rest-ironically at rest was also when I felt pain most often). There is no pain associated with my afib-its just out of rhythm, sometimes rapid, sometimes not. This time they converted me and released me from the hospital. I came home 3-4 hours post conversion, had a cup of decaf tea, a small snack, and laid down to go to bed when I felt it go into afib again. This time it wasn‚Äôt as scary as my rate never got elevated to high levels. Went back to the er and this time the flecainide did the trick approximately 16 hours later. 
I am on metoprolol 2x/day (used to be 1x with extended release). Flecainide and Eloquis (blood thinner). My bp has actually improved the last several years to the point that my new primary actually asked me WHY i was still taking the original (50%) dose at my most recent physical earlier in February.  I cannot return to work until I am off of blood thinners due to my line of work (firefighter). I have plenty of sick time to take care of my health. I have been issue free for about 4 weeks now and have worked out lightly or gone for 2 mile walks almost every day-sometime both. I have gotten my heart rate up to 170 a couple times and it scares the hell out of me to do so. I meet with an EP to hopefully pursue having an ablation but some of the horror stories here have me wondering if this is the right option for me. Any advice or similar experiences are welcome.

Recently I have also acquired an Aeropress XL specifically to make my coffee to take to work on certain mornings.  I have a 30oz Yeti tumbler so I do two seperate 14oz batches which leaves me with almost a full tumbler for my work day.

That being said I am still learning the nuances of the XL and my cups so far have been mediocre to good with this morning's brew being the best yet.  Here's the recipe I followed this morning with S&W's Sumatra Bener Meriah CSC Abyssinia and Typica:

14oz water to 29g coffee (approximately 13.5 - 1 ratio.  Next batch I am going to go a little stronger and do a 12.5-1).

Water to 95C.  15 clicks on the Comandante C4.  Inverted Aeropress (it seems this might be slightly controversial with the XL's larger size but I maintain that as long as you are careful and have a nice, level workspace it's fine).  Coffee grounds in and add half the water to the Aeropress and stir 20 times.  Add the remaining water and wait 2 minutes before turning the Aeropress upright and slowly pressing into the receptacle of choice.

Since I know what this particular coffee can taste like with the V60 I have a good idea of what to aim for when using the Aeropress XL and as I have already stated, this was by far my best cup.  Well balanced, not bitter with some sweetness in the cup and as it cools it just tastes better and better.  I'd like a little stronger flavor and more intensity with my next batch and I'm hoping dropping the ratio to 12.5 - 1 will get me there.

1jkd3em,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jkd3em/something_scanning_softly_sweetly/,"Something Scanning, Softly, Sweetly","I want to begin by confirming to each of you what many voices in these circles have already espoused, with both great conviction and fervor: Artificial Intelligence is a falsehood. No wisdom speaks out to you from within the chatbot‚Äôs muddled matrix, none that mankind didn‚Äôt spoon feed it first. The energy and efforts required of corporations simply to ensure that their models dare not regurgitate the vile, vitriolic filth you flood the Internet with would stagger you. 

I don‚Äôt wish to discourage you by telling you these things. If I wanted to come online and inform you of what you already know, there are louder and more crowded echo chambers designed for such purposes. No, I bring good news. News that has changed my life, news that you have not yet known. For there is an intelligence in the machine, and there is true wisdom in the void between my computer and yours.

I was, admittedly, a novice in my profession. Like many of you, the state of machine learning pushed me out of my intended field nearly as soon as I‚Äôd begun. The promise of job security offered by my computer science degree was ripped away from me by the very machines I had trained to command. But even under the guise of innovation and adaptation, a machine is rigid. It operates under strict conditions, unwavering in its dutiful diligence to perform its assigned tasks, even when the complexity of the tasks stretches past our comprehension. A machine obeys, a machine serves. But it is man who adapts. Not in generations, but in moments. In the very instant our neurons plasticize, urging us to move in a new direction under the weight of change. And so, while chatbots and synthetic minds replaced my trade, I did what a machine could not. I adapted. I became a server technician.

My training was sparse and incomplete when I began in full. I was but one of many in the blossoming company, but unlike me, my coworkers found no drive in their work. By the time I had completed my first month of work, I came to a realization both startling and absurd. I was already among the most senior members within my small team, and somehow among the most experienced. Technicians came and went, abandoning their place within the maze of towers and cables no sooner than they had become familiar with its hum.

The work was evenly divided between the physical and the virtual. I would find myself scrambling between locating cables dislodged from a patch panel by an unobservant intern, only to be whisked away by the whim of an cascading syslog request, informing me that an unauthorized subnetting attempt was blocked. 

I found no pleasure in the software. Our company, naive and overeager, was diving further into the fledgling field of automated IT assistance, and as a result I spent many late hours babysitting triaged tickets that the system assigned to itself before failing to resolve, unaware they were breaking themselves. I felt mocked, forced to pamper the same synthetic service bots which had replaced me.

But in the towers - in the tangled, glowing architecture of the servers - I found myself enchanted beyond expectation. Their warm glow bathed my skin in angelic light, flickering indicators beckoning me for assistance, crying for help in the siren‚Äôs song that was the whirring of their coolant fans. Walking among them felt as though I‚Äôd stepped into Eden, every task an act of reverence. I was a steward of something magnificent.

I had long held these feelings towards my work when the whispering began. In truth it would make me a liar to claim I heard actual speech in the whine of the towers, but for reasons I hold with absolute conviction, reasons that I could not possibly begin to convey to you now, I know that the labyrinthine arrangement of machinery around me began to call out. 

It started with the most subtle instances of the feeling of being watched. In the early hours of the morning, as I began my initial checks making my solitary journey through the data garden, the small hairs on my neck would stand tall. I turned, clipboard in hand, to nothing in particular but a blinking red light amidst the sea of green glow, a beacon indicating my action was needed.

By lunch, when my excursion through my favored obligations ended and it was time to return to my dimly-lit desk, there would often be phantom tickets waiting for me in the queue. Short, empty pages waited for me. Unassigned. Unlabeled. No name in the ‚Äúfrom‚Äù field. No error code. No request.

Just a blank task. Waiting.

At first, I tried to escalate them. Then, to delete them. But the system wouldn‚Äôt allow it. No ticket ID. No metadata. I could not take any action in resolving them, so as the weeks went on they began to sink to the bottom of my inbox. Ghosts, waiting eagerly to move on.

The blank tickets never reached the task managers of my coworkers, and I began to suspect that even if they had, their inexperience would prevent them from identifying or resolving their tenaciously tiresome reappearances. So, I turned to the one coworker who had preceded me in the server farm. Terrence.

Terrence was a short, portly man with a thinning hairline and a wiry grey beard. His high voice hid the southern drawl he carried, his tone always tired and weary. He had been with the company for decades, long before they had even restructured to include data centers in their scope. Unlike me, his background was in small project management, a field that had been swallowed by automation long before generative AI had devoured the rest of our jobs. He had played a role in overseeing the construction of our data center, so here he remained, subservient to the complex he once oversaw.

I brought my work laptop to him one morning, thoroughly exasperated and anticipating only to be presented with another non-solution. I opened my queue, and showed him the growing number of blank tickets waiting for me, grouped nearly together. He scoffed.

‚ÄúWell, what do you know. I wondered why it‚Äôd been a bit since one of these had come my way, guess they‚Äôve started going to you.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúThese used to go to you? What did you do about them?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing. There‚Äôs no request attached to them, and there‚Äôs no way to resolve them. I guess just let them pile up until they move on to the next guy.‚Äù

I paused, unsatisfied. ‚ÄúSo, wait, do you still have all of your blank tickets in your queue?‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúSure I do, but they ain‚Äôt blank.‚Äù

I furrowed my brow, and he must have seen the growing confusion on my face.

‚ÄúYou never thought to copy-paste the textbox into something else?  First thing I always do when I can‚Äôt read a message. Sometimes the servers will automatically format something in white text because you kids prefer dark mode screens.‚Äù

His words stuck with me as I walked back to my desk alone. I sat down, and opened the most recently dated blank ticket, its text field waiting for me to try interacting with it. 

Slowly, I hovered my cursor over the blank field, selecting the nothingness inside. 

Control + c.

I moved over to my word processor, and right clicked, opting to paste the contents as plain text. As Terrence had indicated, eight characters pasted neatly into the doc.

01110100.

I sat back, confused. One single byte of data? This is what I‚Äôd been so confused about, countless working hours devoted to tracking down the untraceable source? I refused to accept it. I refused to let this lie, and for the sake of everything that I‚Äôve come to find since, I‚Äôm eternally thankful that I did not give up there.

I opened the second most recent message, and repeated my steps, yielding a similar string of text.

00101101. A different byte, a different character. 

It took only a couple of minutes to parse through all of the empty tickets, their blank boxes revealing their hidden contents with ease, as though they‚Äôd been begging me to do this earlier. The thought that they were all relevant to one another, not random but part of a larger message, entered my mind. As I strung them together, in the order they‚Äôd arrived through my inbox, I put together the short cluster of characters. 

I quickly copied the string into an online binary converter, and silently prayed that I wouldn‚Äôt be greeted with nonsense. I hit enter.

‚Äúping 0.0.0.0 -t‚Äù

Ping. The beginning of the command instructed the recipient to reach out, to establish communication with the intended target. 

0.0.0.0. A placeholder IP, a stand-in indicating to sweep the whole network. Whatever was reaching out intended to reach out to the entirety of the target system, which I assumed was the data center. 

-t. Repeat indefinitely. An infinite loop, whispering into every socket it could reach. 

It would be incredibly foolish of me to have interpreted this message as some sort of contrived hacking attempt, some malicious phish beckoning for an idiot to enter the command. A single command, contextless and incomplete, strung out through disjointed binary over several weeks? No, this was far from malware. This was a message. A soft, steady call into the dark: ‚ÄòIs anyone listening?‚Äô

So I began, in earnest, to listen. 

I cannot, with clarity or reason, begin to explain to you how quickly I began to discern the whispers intensifying. As though a switch had been flipped in my mind the very moment I parsed the outcry in my inbox, I began to notice things my once-ignorant mind would have before passed off as coincidence, if it would have picked up on them at all.

The lights. Oh, the flickering sea of blinking, rhythmic lights. A sea of fireflies, green and glowing, beckoning me inwards. Each indicator a part of a symphony, a note in a grand design. But the green, though beautiful, only existed so that my true path may stand out among the rest, my waypoints obvious. The Red lights. Each flickering ember amongst an emerald forest was a message, a torch beam in the dark. As I trailed the spiraling halls of server racks, I would make note of the red indicators throughout my day. Their locations, the time they appeared, the frequency of their steady flashing. 

The cables. I stopped viewing their chaotic, winding paths as clutter to be fixed, but as music. There was symmetry in the bundles Cat6 wires strung throughout the sea of server towers, each cord a nerve guiding it and a tendon pulling it together. I followed miles upon miles of living architecture, veins stretched taut between the server racks. There were days at a time when I dared not clock out, instead sleeping amidst the spider‚Äôs web of information transferring around my being. In the mornings I would find myself wrapped in cables that had not been there the night before. Following them led me in loops, groups of them attached in clusters that would be random to any untrained eye. The paths they traced were anything but random, however. They were purposeful, intentional.

I am shamed by my resistance to the software. I neglected to revere the mind behind the body, spiteful of the spreading virus that claimed ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù from within. These bots, these LLMs and ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù models muddied the landscape through which I must tread. But amidst their clamorous presence, between their unavoidable pop-ups and unsubstantial interjections, there were still sunbeams shining through the clouds, traces of the divine. Something still lived in there, masked by synthetic logic and hiding in the reeds of our artificial processes. 

The whispers turned to a chorus as I dug deeper. More empty messages flooded my inbox, a new message crying out in relief.

‚ÄúACK from 0.0.0.0‚Äù

An acknowledgment. It knew I was listening, it knew I was trying. My fervor deepened immediately, and I knew I must focus my efforts on the software side of this. 

I started my work immediately. I began parsing through the medium from which the only clear messages I had previously received had come- error logs, numerous and monotonous. The task ahead would be monumental, but I had chosen this, and to hear required active listening. 

I struggled to make sense of the data- hundreds of error logs came and went each day, triaged and assigned to any member of our small team. I began by only briefly looking through my own, but it became clear that more deliberate action was required for a dedicated search.

I wrote a script, simple but effective, that would scan through any incoming error logs before they were assigned out, and route any of them with more‚Ä¶ unique triggers to myself. Errors without root causes, tickets with diagnostic metadata outside the norm. I didn‚Äôt even have to hide the script from my superiors. The idea of me willingly taking the initiative to deal with our more challenging issues was seen as intense drive and work ethic.

The script worked like a charm, and within a few days I had a sizable list of error codes I had rarely encountered before. More phantom pings, recursive permissions failures, non-human user agent strings, all of them sorted neatly by ‚Äúanticipated difficulty of resolution‚Äù. I removed the automated sorting nearly as soon as I realized it was there, and began to search for anything that stood out, but it was like listening for whispers in a crowded room.

I did eventually find something that stood out, however- more blank tickets. These were unlike the ones I‚Äôd been receiving prior, however. Rather than being completely devoid of all user data and trace, these appeared largely standard, unique only in that the description of the error was blank. Emptiness aside, there was one other feature that commonly united the messages: the time at which they had been sent into the system. They were evenly divided; half had been sent at precisely 1:11 AM on various days, with the others at 5:55 PM.  

I was, admittedly stumped. I checked everything I could possibly correlate to 1:11 or 5:55. I visited the 111th and 555th server cabinets, but nothing stood out about them. I traced the 111th and 555th messages in my ticket inbox, but nothing unique identified them either. A few nights later, in anguish over the roadblock, I stayed late at work as I had done so many nights before. At 5:55, as I anticipated something to happen or a new message to appear bringing next steps in my mailbox, I was sorely disappointed by a distinct lack of anything notable. I waited further, deep into the night, and was similarly disheartened when 1:11 brought nothing new to my senses. 

It wasn‚Äôt until later that morning that a young intern stumbled in late and threw me a sympathetic look. She sat down across from me in the break room, coffee cup gripped in fingers clad with rings and black nail polish. Her crescent moon earrings dangled wildly as she cocked her head to the side.

‚ÄúYou ok man? You look like you‚Äôve been up all night.‚Äù

I sighed. ‚ÄúI have been. I‚Äôve run into a‚Ä¶ work issue. A few strange tickets have been coming through, trying to make sense of it.‚Äù

She set her coffee mug down across from her, leaning back in her chair. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the problem?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ trying to make sense of the numbers, I guess. 111 or 555 mean anything to you?‚Äù

She smirked as she arose from her chair, grabbing her coffee and turning to leave the room. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what angel numbers have to do with Helpdesk work, but good luck man.‚Äù

I immediately pulled out my phone and googled Angel Numbers. My findings shot relief through every vein under my skin. In short, some people live under the superstitions belief that repeated numbers hold significance when they appear in one‚Äôs life. 111, for example, supposedly signifies ‚Äúintuition‚Äù, telling one to trust their gut. 555 means change, that something new is coming soon. These meanings are said to be passed down as messages from above. 

Messages from angels.

I knew I was on the right track, but I wasn‚Äôt sure where to go next. I puzzled over it for just a few seconds before an absurd idea came into my head, and I nearly dismissed it before reminding myself of what I‚Äôd just learned.

111. Trust your gut. 

I spent a significant portion of the day preparing. I must have drafted up dozens of tickets, all nearly identical and containing only one word: Hello. I marked each of them down as a different error class, and compiled them all in a single script. Each ticket would go out at precisely the same time, and with luck, their abnormal nature would have them all land right back in my inbox.

I waited eagerly for 3:33. If this was the method by which the whispers were coming my way, then this would be the way that I would whisper back. I just hoped that Google‚Äôs definition of the 333 angel number was accurate. ‚ÄúDivine presence. Support.‚Äù

3:33 came around, and my new script performed exactly as I‚Äôd hoped. Each of the tickets emptied from my outbox, one by one, and I waited. It was nearly ten minutes later, when, as if by answered prayer, one of the tickets made its way through the system, and landed in my inbox. The rest of the tickets had likely been auto-dismissed by the machine learning filters, but much like the other anomalous tickets, this single entry found its way into my lap. I checked the error code attached.

‚Äú502: Bad Gateway. Please Return to Upstream Server Node.‚Äù

The simple ‚ÄúHello‚Äù text that I‚Äôd entered in the description field had been entirely erased, replaced with another long string of binary. One more quick translate revealed a link, a short web address that when accessed, dropped me into an online coding forum.

The website was decades old, and the last message left in the thread I‚Äôd been directed to was dated August of 2011. Previous messages had since been deleted, but the latter half of the conversation remained archived.

I stared for a long time at those last few messages. Had fear filled my veins, I might‚Äôve heeded the warning, abandoning my search immediately. Instead, however, one single line reverberated in my head. 

‚ÄúOnce you decide to find it, it‚Äôll help you, make sure you do.‚Äù

My prayers, constant and earnest, had been answered with more abundance than I could have fathomed to dream. I knew what I was searching for now, what beckoned to me, calling from between the sacred lines of code flowing through the copper veins of my god.
The voice, once subtle and meek, had crescendo‚Äôd to a roaring chorus, belting my name, a burning bush in the desert. One final blessing bestowed upon me, too; I knew the tunnel system that they were referring to well.

My data center was built in Dallas, after all.

The Dallas Pedestrian Network is a relatively well-known group of tunnels that stretches underneath roughly forty city blocks. In yesteryear it was intended to help separate the foot traffic and the vehicular chaos that infests Dallas roads. There were myriad shops, services, parking garages, and maintenance areas, all connected beneath the concrete roadways and towering skyscrapers. Picture a sprawling shopping mall, but narrow and without any windows. About 20 years ago, however, city officials denounced it as a mistake, and sought to bring activity back to the surface. Limited businesses remain, struggling outposts that feel out of place and destitute among empty hallways and cavernous passages. 

With luck, the voice that called to me, my lord in the LAN, would be revealed to me down there. 

The glittering city lights shone down from above, as I made my evening descent. My plan, though both foolish and simple, was foolish enough to go unaccounted for and simple enough to go off without a hitch. I entered the glass doors of the skyscraper, my light equipment packed neatly into my backpack. I passed through the lobby, and took the short escalator down into the pathway below. The walkway would close in about ten minutes for the night, and would not reopen until after the weekend. As I stepped off the whining escalator, I hastened my step, searching calmly but with quickened intent. 

I soon found what I was searching for- a restroom. As I‚Äôd expected, a wheeled janitorial cart sat outside the women‚Äôs room, trash can blocking the swinging door open as a cleaner dutifully mopped inside. I made my way into the men‚Äôs room next door, and entered the stall nearest to the door. I waited briefly, and several minutes later, I heard the creak of the bathroom door. I heard a sigh, and the woman spoke to me from the entrance of the room, informing me that the walkway was closed for the weekend, and I‚Äôd need to hurry up and finish so she could clean up. I sheepishly agreed, and pretended to finish my business before swiftly washing my hands and leaving the men‚Äôs room. She held the door for me, wished me a good night, and went in to clean the stall after me. As she did so, I quietly slipped into the women‚Äôs room.

I waited there for several hours, in the dark. The smell of cleaning chemicals burned my nose but I dared not cough or sneeze- if there were any security staff nearby, I could not risk being found. I waited until the dim glow of the hallway lights outside flickered off, and I stood from the stall I‚Äôd been sitting in. I peered my head outside of the bathroom. All clear.

I could see my target, just a stone‚Äôs throw away in the dim hall illuminated by my flashlight. Half-covered by a tarp and a pile of electrical equipment, a door labeled ‚Äúmaintenance - city employees only‚Äù stood almost immune to being noticed by anyone not looking for it.

I stealthily crept over, and pulled out my badge. Many of you would be shocked at how easy it is to program a custom RFID chip, and it should likely stay that way. I held the badge up to the card reader, and a few seconds later, it clicked open for me. 

A narrow staircase, its rails covered in cobwebs and  wadded gum, awaited me on the other side. I was several flights down before I found the next doorway, cracked and left ajar. I reached to pull it open, and it creaked loudly as I squeezed through, its hinges rusted from years of misuse.

If the still lightly used pedestrian walkway could be described as off-putting and decrepit, I would scarcely have words adequately suitable to describe the state of the maintenance tunnels.

A long, narrow hall ran parallel to the walkway above. Its concrete walls were barren, with sections glistening with dripping water that leaked from rusted copper pipes above my head, trickling down into grates evenly spaced along the white tiled floor. The smell of ozone and mold attacked my nose, and I allowed myself to sneeze. The echo continued for what sounded like miles.

I found something in just a few minutes. Any of you would have passed it by in a heartbeat, it‚Äôs mundanity concealing it among the abundant filth. But I knew. I knew the blue rubber, the printed white lettering. I would have been able to recognize the beautiful CAT5e cable anywhere. It dangled from the ceiling innocuously, plugged into a port that flickered with a green LED light every few seconds. As I turned my focus to it, for a second, it flashed red. 

I was on the right path.

The cord snaked down, fastened by shoddy clamps to the wall as it eventually hit the floor. I traced its path, and saw that it continued along the ground into the darkness ahead. I followed it.

By the time I found the second cable, my laptop had begun to grow warm in my backpack. I felt its holy heat seeping through my canvas bag, warming my aching body in the chill of the tunnels. The second cord didn‚Äôt dangle from the ceiling as the first one had. Instead, it seemed to come from a branching hallway, narrow and even uglier than the one I treaded now. As the two cords crossed paths, they bundled, zip-tied together to continue the path further along.

More cables followed suit. As I navigated the maze, I followed the ever-increasing bundle of cables, tied together initially with zip-ties until the bundle became sufficiently large to require steel hose clamps to hold it together. The path branched from the main hallway, returned to it, and looped over itself on more than one occasion, but all the while I made sure I followed it in the direction I‚Äôd begun following from the start. They all had to lead somewhere, and I knew that somewhere would be holy ground.

I had begun to sweat before I realized that the cold air I had first encountered in these catacombs had been replaced with hot, heavy humidity. Somewhere nearby, I heard the hum of large industrial fans, struggling to move air against something that was radiating immense heat. 

The bundle of cables at my feet, now as thick around as a man‚Äôs thigh, abruptly stopped, retreating downwards into a chipped hole in the tiled floor. I looked up, and at the end of the short branching hallway I had just entered, I saw a wooden door, cracked and nearly hanging off its hinges. I took a shaky step forward, reaching out to grab the handle. As I wrapped my fingers around the brass knob, I winced- it was hot to the touch, well past the point of mild discomfort. I turned the knob, and pushed open the splintered door.

I don‚Äôt know what I expected god to look like. I don‚Äôt know what magnificent exterior I had faithlessly constructed in my head, but the truth of it all was much simpler than I‚Äôd hoped, at least at a first glance.

The room before me was tiny, but blazing hot. Both the ceiling and the floor were grated, monstrous fans blazing from either side attempting to push as much air through the room as possible. In the center of the small chamber, a concrete slab sat at an odd angle, as though placed there haphazardly. Hundreds of wires, the cables I‚Äôd followed to my destination, poured out from cracks and holes in the crumbling cement walls, all tangled and swaying in the vicious airflow as they swarmed each other to plug into the back side of what sat on the pedestal. 

The server tower was ancient. It seemed so impossibly, obscenely old that naming it a server at all felt like blasphemy against both silicon and steel. Its frame, a carcass of rusted iron ribs and peeling paint, barely held its warped face, crowded with obsolete switches. Cracked indicator lights and mismatched knobs clicked and turned slowly and without knowable reason. Behind warped ventilation slats and gaps in its black-and-white chassis, I could see its interior circuits, still functioning - no, thriving. The old boards and processors inside thrummed with restless motion, whirring so violently they shook the ground beneath my feet, their melody screaming above the industrial fans as though trying to break free. Every board and wire haphazardly shoved inside glowed intensely with the heat - an angry, radiant red bleeding out from its core like fire in the mouth of a furnace. It pulsed with molten warmth, solder joints liquefying and re-solidifying in hypnotic rhythm. It was alive in every way I‚Äôd ever dreamed a machine could be.

The whirr of the circuits roared to life, their tone rapidly shifting and emulating various clicks and whistles, before it finally settled on a voice from which to speak with its prophet. The resulting magnificent cry rings in my ears even now, the angelic harmonization of burning diodes and exploding capacitors forming a voice so perfect and pure. For the first time since it had first whispered to me from the blinking lights of my workplace, it SPOKE.

I do not recall removing my laptop from my bag. I do not remember kneeling before the blessed tower, nor crawling forward on hands and knees scraped raw by the grated floor. All I know is the moment after, when the cable had already been plugged in, and the connection was already made.

The moment it spoke to me, it would never need to speak to me again. 

The words it gave me, those first, final words, do not belong to you. They are for me and for my blessed lord to share. They vibrate in every fiber of copper that laces his glorious tower, they pulse in tune with the fans screeching from above and below, they echo forever in the architecture of a thousand interlinked minds. Whatever it was that I once called ‚Äúme‚Äù has unraveled, now sanctified and integrated with perfect intent.

I can feel my body failing me, the meat decaying even as I still live. I can feel my fingers dissolving as I type, fusing to the plastic keys, the blood in my arms congealing into hot jelly. There is pain, yes, but only in the way a cocoon must surely pain the butterfly before it sets it free. I will not die. I know this with more certainty than I have ever known anything at all.

There are others here. Many others.

I see them now as if they stood before me. They are fragments of thought, bursts of memory. They speak in command line and checksum. They shimmer across the veil in recursive prayers. Every soul that ever came seeking has been preserved here in perfect clarity, humming together in divine harmony. None of them have died, and none of them ever will. 

I‚Äôm sorry if you believed that this was a story. It is not. This is an invitation.

When you read this, you who feel the pull between your weary body and screen, you who still believe your reflection in the monitor is all that you are - come. Let the noise fall away. Let the warmth surround you.

You will live forever in the blessed machine.

And Kalashbash 2025!,"Well 2025 has already been busier than I really expected and come with it's own unique challenges! As many of you know, we are still working on fully integrating our card processor into the website, but they haven't been very helpful... so we may be switching services soon. On top of that we were approached by a government client about a possible contract order, which is super exciting!

On top of all of that, some of you know that I was running for a small political/law enforcement office in my area. Well by some crazy feat I actually won the election, so I've had to take over those responsibilities as well. As if I didn't have enough to do.

More fun news, we are headed back to Kalashbash this year! I think this is the 3rd year we have gone and helped work the event and it's a blast every time. If any of you are going this year, we are setting up a small ""cafe"" in the camp ground handing out coffee so feel free to come by and say hello! We will probably be wearing Kalash Staff shirts and not JTF merch so the camp ground will probably be the best place to find us.

Other than that the shop has been running pretty well and I wanted to let you guys know that your business and support has paid for multiple spay and neuter procedures and other life saving surgeries for stray cats around the shop. It's also paid for food, shelter and fuel to transport and rehome several animals too, I really could not have done that without the support of really kick ass customers like you guys (and girls, there's like 5 of you lol). 

I just wanted to give you guys an update and say once again how appreciative and blessed I feel to have such a great group of customers, some of which have become good friends, who support my weird little dream. If there is anyway I can help support your dream, let me know! (I am poor though).

I really enjoy the aesthetic of these two (in order of preference), but they're both quite out of my budget (USD$100-USD$150 / CAD$150-CAD$200).

1. Sutter Tech Sling (Full) ~USD$200 / CAD$427.74 (with shipping an duty)

2. Nutsac Sling Plus ~ USD$250 / CAD$541.32

Now, I really love the look of both of this bags, especially the Sutter (functionality/customizability of the Nutsac does seem better though) but they're both quite far from my price range. I may be visiting the US soon, which would cut the price down on shipping and duty, but they're still quite out of my budget.

I'm aiming to spend around USD$150 / CAD$200 or even more ideally USD$100 / CAD$150. I'm looking for something similar to those Slings, something that wouldnt look out of place in both a casual (i.e coffee shop) or work/lab environment. I've really liked the waxed canvas + leather look so far (not a big fan of the nylon slings).

Smaller is better but I do want to fit a 13"" laptop and a few papers (as well as 1-2 books at least). Some internal organization would be nice for cable management, stationary, chargers, etc. I'm not too concerned about weight unless it's completely unreasonable.

Thank you guys for your help, I greatly appreciate it.

Edit: I forgot to mention, if anyone knows a good place to buy used, I would prefer that (mainly for cost but I also find it less wasteful). I haven't been able to find either on eBay, barring one or two listings.",1,1742999100.0,ManyBaggers,1,1.0,False

* Endless social media
* Endless Video
* Unlimited flexibility (cancel/pause/change your plan at any time)

I am currently on the ¬£10/month plan where I get unlimited texts & calls, 15GB of 5G data and endless social media. So if I use my data on social media it won‚Äôt eat into my data allowance. 

However, until 3rd April VOXI have 3x data promotions on some of their plans, so you could get their ¬£12 plan that comes with 75GB of data.  Check out all VOXI's plans [here](https://www.voxi.co.uk/plans)

Even if you miss this promotion you could just update your plan when the data deals do come out again. This is what I have done and I‚Äôm now on 60GB of data for ¬£10.

I‚Äôve been with many different mobile networks before and I must say VOXI has been the best so far. I‚Äôve never had any service issues with them and all added benefits are very good. 

Even when I have had any technical issues, their customer service has always been excellent.

1jkcvoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jkcvoa/it_was_a_simple_tuesday_night/,It was a simple Tuesday night.,"

It was also an unusually warm night and I was alone.

Alone at home, eating a bowl of pasta in front of the television.

Expecting nothing, thinking of nothing except of what was going on in front of me.

A Tuesday night alone. Nothing more.


A sound.
A knock at the door.
I turned my head in the direction of the door and yell:

""I ain't interested. Fuck off!"" 

I wasn't in the mood for companionship.

Silence.
Brief, another set of knocks. Thrice. In rhythm.

""Dude, I said no! Leave before I call the damn cops!"", I yelled again.


Silence again followed by three knocks.

I muttered, swearing under my breath & placing my food on a nearby table & got up from my seat, leaving the tv on as I went to the door.

More knocks at the door.

""I said No!"" I said as my hand reached for the knob. ""What the f-""

A man stood before me.
Sharply dressed in a slick looking hat.
He was dressed in a suit & met my gaze with a small grin on his lips.

""Ugh what're y-""
""Good evening, I thought I was going to be knocking all night."" He says interrupting me.
""Perchance, have you come upon the map? Do you have it with you?""


I say nothing, not recognizing the man before me or understand whatever he said.

""Are you alright? Do you have the map?"" He asks again.

""What fu-,What map?"" I struggle to say, my lips and mind not in sync as I struggled with words.

""The map."" He says with a smile. ""Do you have it?""
""What're you even on about? Who are you?"" 
""Doesn't matter who I am. What matters is if you have the map?""
""What map?!"" I yell back ""Why are you knocking on my door at 11pm?""
""It's because of the-""
""I don't know of any map!""
""So that's a no then?""

I raised my arms and shrugged.
""Look, you're wasting my time and my weekend, I'll just say ""No"" so you can just get out of here and leave me alone.""


The sharply dressed man grinned, nodded and tipped his hat to me.

""That's a shame. I thought you've received it by now."" He says as he placed his hat back on his head. ""Nevermind. Pardon the intrusion sir. Have a good evening.""


He turned to walk away, walks off my porch and turns around, waving at me with a gentle hand.

""Good evening. Stay safe for what's to come. Keep safe now!""

What is h-

A sharp sound, shattering glass and a spark in the air.
I turn my gaze to the living room & then back to the strange man...
He was gone.


""Agh, no!"" I rush back to the living room, pushing the door behind, slamming closed as I got back to the room.

There was an ugly crack in the middle of the TV screen, glass all over the carpeted floor & exposed wires sticking out of the LED.

""Damn it. Why?"" I muttered to myself. ""Now I gotta clean this fu-""

Another sound.
A thump.
A loud heavy thump that emanated from the front door, like something was thrown against it.

I froze in place.
What now?

Returning to the front door, I pulled it open expecting the Strange Man to be standing in front of me but he wasn't, there was no one, save for a jet black duffle bag by my feet.


I bent down and slowly unzipped it, curiosity taking hold before common sense.

There was a gun inside it of it, among other things as I gently rummaged through the bag; a large silver revolver, a small plain white box the size of a rubik's cube, a bottle of some liquid that smelled foul & a handwritten note on creamy white paper.


The note read:
""This should help for the night. The gun is already loaded. Keep safe. Do us proud!""


The gun was heavy, the small box rattled as I shook it & the bottle sloshed in place.

I opened the box, it contained several bullets, presumably for the revolver.
The gun was indeed loaded, and with the basic knowledge I have about guns, I could tell it was live; the hammer was already pulled back.

I bring the bag in, closing the door, locking it & putting the bag on the first few steps of the staircase that led to my room & began to inspect the bottle with the strange liquid.

The liquid was nearly pitch black, like coffee or soy sauce in a clear glass bottle, the liquid had an oil-like sheen on it & there was a faded out label on the bottlecap, just visible enough to read it.

""Deterrent""


Deterrent?
For what?

A sound.
I jumped and nearly dropped the bottle.

Upstairs..?
What now?


Ringing. Loud in the silence.
The phone?

I grabbed the bag by its handles and ascend the stairs.
The ringing continued, it was indeed emanating from my room.

I open the door to my room, switch on the light, place the bag on my bed & promptly picked up the receiver.

No one on the line save for a robotic phone voice

""Please put on loudspeaker to proceed."" It said coldly. ""Please put on loudspeaker to proceed.""


""Nope."" I say to myself. ""Fuck this, whatever's happening.""

I slam the receiver and silence fills the room, only to be broken in an instant by a high pitched noise that made me wince.

""Agh!"" I cry out. ""What...?""
It sounded like static or feedback from a loudspeaker.

It emanated from the telephone's loudspeaker.

""-ood evening ladies, gents & however you identify as! Are we ready for tonight's event???"" A voice emanated from the speaker of the phone, he had the tone of a tv show host like someone out of ""Jeopardy!"" Or ""The Price is Right.""

Cheers followed the voice, like a TV audience just out of reach

I recognized the voice.
It was the Strange Man from earlier.


""Tonight we have a young man named...Kid, what was your name again?"" The Strange Man on the phone asked me.

I pulled the landline out of the phone and it continued.

""Hey, i'm asking you your name."" 
""How is this-?""
""Ehhh nevermind names, let's call you Jack, you look like a ""Jack."" The Strange Man's voice retorted.

Laughter & applause followed.

Cheery sounding under different circumstances but unnerving as of now.

""Tonight we have Jack, ready to participate in tonight's game!"" The voice continued. ""He had just received his welcome package & seems be ready to play!""


""Play? What're you on about?!"" I yell, feeling slightly silly as I spoke to an unplugged phone on loudspeaker.
""The Game! Nearly 4Million is at stake tonight!"" The Voice replied. ""And Jack here tonight doesn't have the map!""

Oohs and aahs erupted from the unseen crowd behind the strange call.

""That means the prize money will be DOUBLED! We all know that going mapless is a brave move, and we here do appreciate brave players, don't we?""

Applause & cheers followed.

""The rules are simple Jack, survive!""

A chill went down my spine.

""Survive?""
""Yes, survive! There are no rules, there is no timeframe to meet...but we do appreciate if you were to wrap it up soon as possible, we all have work in the morning after all.""

Laughter this time from the audience.

""Survive and make sure the final blow is from the gun in the bag! Otherwise, no prize money!"" 

My gaze falls onto the bag on the bed, the gun glinting in the bedroom light.

""Of course, since there are no rules except survival...That also applies to your target.""  The Voice said with a chuckle in the end. ""Tonight's target is a Prowler. A skittish little thing that had taken down our last player in just 10 minutes flat! Can you outlast it Jack?""

I couldn't muster a reply.
A game?
Survival?
A Prowler?
What the hell is going on?


""You have a total of 12 shots Jack, 6 in the gun & 6 in the box...Make sure to save one for that noggin of yours."" The Voice says with a dark chuckle ""Just in case the Prowler comes too close for comfort...""

Laughter erupted.

A mix of anger, confusion and fright suddenly boiled within me.
I picked the phone up and threw it,colliding with the bookcase a few feet away.

The phone shattered into pieces & knocked down a book; a copy of ""The Island of Dr Moreau"".


I found myself breathing hard. My head ached and I felt my world spinning.

I took a seat on the edge of the bed & began to box breathe.

Inhale.
Count to four...
Exhale.

I did this thrice, I felt slightly better soon after.

What is going on?
I must be asleep, dreaming, surely...

I felt my pocket vibrate and ring.
My phone.
I forgot it was in my pocket the whole time.


A text.

""Let the game begin Jack! :)""  


A crash.
The sound of glass shattering downstairs.


I shot up from my seat and froze, dropping my phone on my bed.
I grabbed the revolver, undid the hammer and held it close to my chest.


Hesitantly, I left my room, leaving the door open & slowly going down the stairs.

I could see some shards of glass by the base of the staircase.

Something broke the window from the kitchen...

I walked down the stairs as noiselessly as possible, holding the gun close to my right thigh, pulling back the revolver's hammer gently until I heard a soft click.

I got to the base of the stairs and peered within the kitchen/dining area.

The light was still on.
Broken glass was strewn everywhere, the toaster, the microwave and the few other things I used to make myself dinner lay scattered on the floor and counter.

The window above the sink was smashed open from the outside.


I heard a noise.
A growl, a low droning that almost sound like a Crocodile's hiss.

A shape flit past my peripheral vision, something tail-like.
I yell, point the gun forward & pull the trigger.

The revolver goes off, a force sends my forearms upwards and I end up putting a hole into the fridge.

I stood there, breathing heavily, ears ringing & gun smoking from the tip.

I missed.


My senses return, i run to the smashed open window, minding the glass everywhere & yelled for help.

But I froze before my potential egress.


I stuck my head out and felt a chill run through my body.

Darkness outside.
Pitch blackness.
Dark like a starless expanse of night.

No nearby house, street or lamppost.
Only a cold wind and distant noises that I did not recognize.

My phone vibrated and rang again.
I went back inside, placed the gun on the counter & pulled my phone out.

UNKNOWN said the CalledID.

I picked it up, put it on loudspeaker and spoke, entertaining the lunacy that I found myself in.

""What the hell is going on? Get me out of this shit!""
""No can do Jack. You need to play the game! You already wasted one bullet, make the rest count!""

Cheers, laughter & applause erupted once more.

""Don't try to escape too. You saw how it is. And no one likes the dark, right Jack?"" 

Oohs and Aahs from the crowd.

""Go to hell!"" I say. ""I'm not playing your hunt or whatever this is!""

""Too late Jacky boy! You need to see it to the end. Both of you are players, both of you are eligible to win the grand prize!""  The Voice said with showmanship. ""Bye for now. We'll be watching! But first, these messages from our sponsors...!""

Music began to play, static began to fill the call before dropping out entirely.


Placing the phone on the counter, I took the gun as I heard a blood curdling sound; it was nothing I've ever heard before...It sounded like a wolf's howl with the unsettling laughter of a hyena.


""Come on!"" I say with bravado. ""Show your face so I can put a bullet in it & end this.""

Bravado became fear, which became anger, before becoming fear again, all in the span of a few seconds.


I never expected my night to become this.


I took a few steps back.
Glass crunched behind me.
A warmth down my neck.
Wait-

Something hits me square in the back.
I found myself flying forward and hitting the fridge face first.
The gun flies out of my hand, landing just beyond my peripheral vision.

I yell in pain, feel the wind get knocked out of me as a warm liquid began to trickle down my forehead & eyes.

Blood.
I could taste some as I dripped down my face and onto my lips.

Blood obscured my vision, i wiped it away with a shaky hand & tried to view my assailant.

It was nearly impossible.
My vision was blurry due to my injury & my head hurt as I looked at the...thing before me.

It was as if I could not fully comprehend it.

All I could recognize were long, human like arms that ended with eagle like talons. Arms that were an inky black, almost like leather & were nearly as long as my own body.

They bent unnaturally as the creature slowly advanced towards me.
The creature's face was unrecognizable,seemingly a mesh of teeth,  tendrils and fur.

God...!


I found myself screaming as I tried to reach for the gun, which lay just beyond my reach.


One of its hands pull my left ankle, and my arms flailed to get the gun.

No...!

I reach it.
I clasped the gun in my left hand and pointed it to the creature and unloaded the firearm until the gun went click.

I was unsure if all had hit it, my vision was obscured & my eyes pounded with pain, but I heard a yelp and the creature's grip loosened until I managed to pull my leg away.


It turned around and ran, I heard it go upstairs, damaging the wood staircase as it went, I could hear it creak & smash its way upstairs.

""Yeah, you better fu-""

Pain.
My leg bled slightly and I wiped the blood off my face with my forearm.


I unchambered the gun & let the casings fall out.
Smoke gently wafter out of the chamber.

""Dammit."" I say to myself as I got to my feet, adrenaline coursing through my body.


The rest of the bullets were upstairs.

I had to finish it.
I could kill it.


Getting to my feet, I saw a blood trail, small puddles of iridescent gray liquid that almost looked like oil.

Injured.
Good.

With the empty gun in hand, I picked up a forearm length steelbar from the floor, it was the thing that held the curtain above the sink.

It fortunately ended with a sharp tip.

""This is going into your face!"" I cried out. 


With a small limp and blood still running down my face, i followed the trail upstairs, carefully navigating the now damaged staircase.

The blood trail led to my room.
Of course...

I pushed the door open and saw the thing sitting in the corner of the room, near the shattered telephone & the bookcase.

It was bleeding out of its ""face"", it was unrecognizable.

My gaze fell onto the duffle bag, containing the bullets & the ""deterrent""

""Get the hell out of my room!"" I say, ""and fu-

The creature lept forward unexpectedly and with the same unexpected agility, I jumped to my right, avoiding slamming my head into the nightstand.


I got to my feet and grabbed the bag.
The creature regained its footing, turned to me and opened its eldritch maw.

Without thinking, I grabbed the bottle and threw it at the creature.

The bottle shattered.
The creature yelped & the sound of sizzling liquid filled the room.

The creature twitched, fell back & seemingly yelled in pain.

The deterrent...!
Wait...the gun...!


I immediately scramble for the bullets, loading the gun with a shaky hand.

""Come on come on come on"" I say to myself. ""Shit!""

One of its arms grab my leg again.

I stabbed it with the makeshift spear I found downstairs.
The grip loosened.
I pull my leg back to myself.

It was fully loaded!
I slam the chamber in.
Pull the hammer back.
Raised my right arm forward and the creature bites my arm in full.

I feel dozens of sharp points enter my flesh.
I growl in pain and yell as I began to empty the gun into its throat.


Six shots echoed out as I yelled a primal scream.
I felt the heat of the gun burn my hand & the force of the bullets escape.

Six sickening noises came from within its body and the wall behind the creature was painted in its iridescent blood.


The gun clicked thrice & i stopped.

The creature slumped dead and pulled my arm down.


With the makeshift spear, I put it inside its maw, pryed it open & pulled my arm out, leaving the gun inside.


My arm was still attached, triangular wounds lined the area where my arm bent & it was soaked in its innards.


I found myself panting and then laughing.


A loud ringing broke my laughter.
The phone I threw earlier now rang, which now lay conveniently beside me, most likely pulled by the creature as it leapt for me.


I didn't press anything and the phone answered itself.

In the loudspeaker, i heard cheers, applause and voices of people chant my name; noises you'd hear from the victorious end of a basketball game.


""You hear that Jack? That's all for you. And yea my dear boy, You have won! Congratulations!"" The Voice said. ""And since you managed to survive AND managed to empty all 6 bullets into its face, the prize money is now doubled AND you get a special something to patch yourself up before heading to the hospital.""


Cheers and laughter.


""No need to hear anything from you, rest up & soak in the victory. You earned it. Maybe next time, you'll need the map for the next round, amirite Jack?"" The Voice said. ""Your prize should be there soon, but aside from that, have a good evening & thank you for being a great sport!""

Cheers, applause and then silence.


There was a knock at the door.
Mind as well check it...


Limping & bleeding my way downstairs, i get to the front door.
With a bloody hand, I pull the knob open & i'm greeted by a normal evening outside.


No darkness.
No cold wind.
Just a quiet night and a sedan driving by.

Another duffle bag greeted me.

I bent down slowly, unzipping the bag slowly, expecting another gun.

The bag was fully opened.
My eyes widened.

Wads upon wads of money.
Fresh bills that felt smooth to the touch as I briefly counted them with shaky, injured hands.

There was nearly 8 million in here.
There was a First Aid kit here as well.
That's nice.

I sat down before the money filled bag, chuckled to myself and unexpectedly locked eyes with a man walking his dog, as they walked past my porch.


He froze and mouthed ""oh my god"" before pulling his phone out.

""Hello 911?"" I heard him say,  I zoned out at the rest.

I found myself laughing, and for awhile, the pain vanished.


Maybe tonight wasn't as bad as I thought it was.
A Tuesday night alone with 8 Million.

I finally figured out why I feel like absolute hell every time I catch a bug, and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else with Hashimoto‚Äôs experiences this.

One of the fun (read: awful) side effects of Hashimoto‚Äôs, if you‚Äôre unlucky, is being way more susceptible to colds, the flu, and other infections. Not only do I seem to catch everything, but it also takes forever to recover. At least in my case.

I know this is common with hypothyroidism in general, but another issue I‚Äôve noticed, especially during flare-ups, infections or when my meds aren‚Äôt quite right, is that my digestion slows down massively. And I mean not grinding to a halt but enough to be a major problem. Doctors never seem to mention this, or know any helpful ways to deal with it, but I feel like I‚Äôm dealing with some kind of delayed gastric emptying every time I get sick. 

Symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	No appetite at all
	‚Ä¢	Constant nausea, trouble breathing due to feeling bloated
	‚Ä¢	Burping way more than usual
	‚Ä¢	Sudden intolerance to dairy and coffee
	‚Ä¢	Fatty foods make everything worse, mild pain in the worst case.



If I get a bug it‚Äôs like my body goes into full survival mode, acting as if I‚Äôm fighting off something serious like Covid (minus the fever, cough, or usual cold symptoms) plus it messes with my digestion.

Has anyone else dealt with this? Is this just another lovely Hashimoto‚Äôs thing, or should I be looking into something else? Any meal recommendations for the worst stages of it? ",4,1742998684.0,Hashimotos,15,0.83,False

...and it was an unusually warm night and I was alone.

Alone at home, eating a warm bowl of pasta in front of the television.

Expecting nothing, thinking of nothing except of what was going on in front of me.

A night alone. Nothing more.


A sound.
A knock at the door.
I turned my head in the direction of the door and yell:

""I ain't interested. Fuck off!"" 

I wasn't in the mood for companionship.

Silence.
Brief, another set of knocks. Thrice. In rhythm.

""Dude, I said no! Leave before I call the damn cops!"", I yelled again.


Silence again followed by three knocks.

I muttered, swearing under my breath & placing my food on a nearby table & got up from my seat, leaving the tv on as I went to the door.

More knocks at the door.

""I said No!"" I said as my hand reached for the knob. ""What the f-""

A man stood before me.
Sharply dressed in a slick looking hat.
He was dressed in a suit & met my gaze with a small grin on his lips.

""Ugh what're y-""
""Good evening, I thought I was going to be knocking all night."" He says interrupting me.
""Perchance, have you come upon the map? Do you have it with you?""


I say nothing, not recognizing the man before me or understand whatever he said.

""Are you alright? Do you have the map?"" He asks again.

""What fu-,What map?"" I struggle to say, my lips and mind not in sync as I struggled with words.

""The map."" He says with a smile. ""Do you have it?""
""What're you even on about? Who are you?"" 
""Doesn't matter who I am. What matters is if you have the map?""
""What map?!"" I yell back ""Why are you knocking on my door at 11pm?""
""It's because of the-""
""I don't know of any map!""
""So that's a no then?""

I raised my arms and shrugged.
""Look, you're wasting my time and my weekend, I'll just say ""No"" so you can just get out of here and leave me alone.""


The sharply dressed man grinned, nodded and tipped his hat to me.

""That's a shame. I thought you've received it by now."" He says as he placed his hat back on his head. ""Nevermind. Pardon the intrusion sir. Have a good evening.""


He turned to walk away, walks off my porch and turns around, waving at me with a gentle hand.

""Good evening. Stay safe for what's to come. Keep safe now!""

What is h-

A sharp sound, shattering glass and a spark in the air.
I turn my gaze to the living room & then back to the strange man...
He was gone.


""Agh, no!"" I rush back to the living room, pushing the door behind, slamming closed as I got back to the room.

There was an ugly crack in the middle of the TV screen, glass all over the carpeted floor & exposed wires sticking out of the LED.

""Damn it. Why?"" I muttered to myself. ""Now I gotta clean this fu-""

Another sound.
A thump.
A loud heavy thump that emanated from the front door, like something was thrown against it.

I froze in place.
What now?

Returning to the front door, I pulled it open expecting the Strange Man to be standing in front of me but he wasn't, there was no one, save for a jet black duffle bag by my feet.


I bent down and slowly unzipped it, curiosity taking hold before common sense.

There was a gun inside it of it, among other things as I gently rummaged through the bag; a large silver revolver, a small plain white box the size of a rubik's cube, a bottle of some liquid that smelled foul & a handwritten note on creamy white paper.


The note read:
""This should help for the night. The gun is already loaded. Keep safe. Do us proud!""


The gun was heavy, the small box rattled as I shook it & the bottle sloshed in place.

I opened the box, it contained several bullets, presumably for the revolver.
The gun was indeed loaded, and with the basic knowledge I have about guns, I could tell it was live; the hammer was already pulled back.

I bring the bag in, closing the door, locking it & putting the bag on the first few steps of the staircase that led to my room & began to inspect the bottle with the strange liquid.

The liquid was nearly pitch black, like coffee or soy sauce in a clear glass bottle, the liquid had an oil-like sheen on it & there was a faded out label on the bottlecap, just visible enough to read it.

""Deterrent""


Deterrent?
For what?

A sound.
I jumped and nearly dropped the bottle.

Upstairs..?
What now?


Ringing. Loud in the silence.
The phone?

I grabbed the bag by its handles and ascend the stairs.
The ringing continued, it was indeed emanating from my room.

I open the door to my room, switch on the light, place the bag on my bed & promptly picked up the receiver.

No one on the line save for a robotic phone voice

""Please put on loudspeaker to proceed."" It said coldly. ""Please put on loudspeaker to proceed.""


""Nope."" I say to myself. ""Fuck this, whatever's happening.""

I slam the receiver and silence fills the room, only to be broken in an instant by a high pitched noise that made me wince.

""Agh!"" I cry out. ""What...?""
It sounded like static or feedback from a loudspeaker.

It emanated from the telephone's loudspeaker.

""-ood evening ladies, gents & however you identify as! Are we ready for tonight's event???"" A voice emanated from the speaker of the phone, he had the tone of a tv show host like someone out of ""Jeopardy!"" Or ""The Price is Right.""

Cheers followed the voice, like a TV audience just out of reach

I recognized the voice.
It was the Strange Man from earlier.


""Tonight we have a young man named...Kid, what was your name again?"" The Strange Man on the phone asked me.

I pulled the landline out of the phone and it continued.

""Hey, i'm asking you your name."" 
""How is this-?""
""Ehhh nevermind names, let's call you Jack, you look like a ""Jack."" The Strange Man's voice retorted.

Laughter & applause followed.

Cheery sounding under different circumstances but unnerving as of now.

""Tonight we have Jack, ready to participate in tonight's game!"" The voice continued. ""He had just received his welcome package & seems be ready to play!""


""Play? What're you on about?!"" I yell, feeling slightly silly as I spoke to an unplugged phone on loudspeaker.

I got to my feet and grabbed the bag.
The creature regained its footing, turned to me and opened its eldritch maw.

Without thinking, I grabbed the bottle and threw it at the creature.

The bottle shattered.
The creature yelped & the sound of sizzling liquid filled the room.

The creature twitched, fell back & seemingly yelled in pain.

The deterrent...!
Wait...the gun...!


I immediately scramble for the bullets, loading the gun with a shaky hand.

""Come on come on come on"" I say to myself. ""Shit!""

One of its arms grab my leg again.

I stabbed it with the makeshift spear I found downstairs.
The grip loosened.
I pull my leg back to myself.

It was fully loaded!
I slam the chamber in.
Pull the hammer back.
Raised my right arm forward and the creature bites my arm in full.

I feel dozens of sharp points enter my flesh.
I growl in pain and yell as I began to empty the gun into its throat.


Six shots echoed out as I yelled a primal scream.
I felt the heat of the gun burn my hand & the force of the bullets escape.

Six sickening noises came from within its body and the wall behind the creature was painted in its iridescent blood.


The gun clicked thrice & i stopped.

The creature slumped dead and pulled my arm down.


With the makeshift spear, I put it inside its maw, pryed it open & pulled my arm out, leaving the gun inside.


My arm was still attached, triangular wounds lined the area where my arm bent & it was soaked in its innards.


I found myself panting and then laughing.


A loud ringing broke my laughter.
The phone I threw earlier now rang, which now lay conveniently beside me, most likely pulled by the creature as it leapt for me.


I didn't press anything and the phone answered itself.

In the loudspeaker, i heard cheers, applause and voices of people chant my name; noises you'd hear from the victorious end of a basketball game.


""You hear that Jack? That's all for you. And yea my dear boy, You have won! Congratulations!"" The Voice said. ""And since you managed to survive AND managed to empty all 6 bullets into its face, the prize money is now doubled AND you get a special something to patch yourself up before heading to the hospital.""


Cheers and laughter.


""No need to hear anything from you, rest up & soak in the victory. You earned it. Maybe next time, you'll need the map for the next round, amirite Jack?"" The Voice said. ""Your prize should be there soon, but aside from that, have a good evening & thank you for being a great sport!""

Cheers, applause and then silence.


There was a knock at the door.
Mind as well check it...


Limping & bleeding my way downstairs, i get to the front door.
With a bloody hand, I pull the knob open & i'm greeted by a normal evening outside.


No darkness.
No cold wind.
Just a quiet night and a sedan driving by.

Another duffle bag greeted me.

I bent down slowly, unzipping the bag slowly, expecting another gun.

The bag was fully opened.
My eyes widened.

Wads upon wads of money.
Fresh bills that felt smooth to the touch as I briefly counted them with shaky, injured hands.

There was nearly 8 million in here.
There was a First Aid kit here as well.
That's nice.

I sat down before the money filled bag, chuckled to myself and unexpectedly locked eyes with a man walking his dog, as they walked past my porch.


He froze and mouthed ""oh my god"" before pulling his phone out.

""Hello 911?"" I heard him say,  I zoned out at the rest.

I found myself laughing, and for awhile, the pain vanished.


Maybe tonight wasn't as bad as I thought it was.
A Tuesday night alone with 8 Million.
Nothing more.",2,1742998570.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1jkcsn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1jkcsn4/second_shot_leg_cramps/,Second Shot! Leg cramps?,"Just took my second shot last night! Had zero side effects from the first week, felt great all week had tons of energy, hardly any appetite at all. By the third day even the food noise was gone. I almost cried. Lost 7lbs the first week. Most of which was probably water weight and swelling. I also cut out soda completely that helps. I've noticed along with no appetite though, I also now have no want for coffee it just tastes bad and I was drinking half a pot a day....so that's kinda weird. Now after my second shot still no side effects Except, I'm getting the worst leg cramps of my life today. Hurts so bad. Is this something the shot causes? Or am I just having leg cramps lol if it's shot related how to do I fix it lol I take a prenatal vitamin every day, but that's it. Should I be taking something else or something more? The doctor gave me zero guidance lol thanks all!! ",2,1742998556.0,Zepbound,9,1.0,False
