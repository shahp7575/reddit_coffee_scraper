I got so excited about it cause I've been a loyal costumer other cafes before. But I never really got that 'the usual?' scenario I only read in books.

1oh8r16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oh8r16/my38f_husband44m_lied_about_involvement_in/,My(38f) husband(44m) lied about involvement in friend’s sexual harassment scandal,"I posted here a while back, trying to get perspective on my marriage and realized it is too lengthy to put all in one post. It’s better to just write just one issue at a time.  So if you think you saw this before, you may have.  I am also only writing about one issue here but there are many others that can’t be included because this is far too long as it is. We will call my husband Will. 

A few relevant facts about me so that you know some basics of my life and some of Will’s frustrations with me:

1. I was a stay at home mom till very recently.

2. I don’t drive.

3. I am terrible with finances.

4. I have always been an absentminded and messy person. You can generally tell how I am doing emotionally by the state of my “personal spaces.” When things are good, spaces are clean with just some clutter here and there. When things are bad, spaces are sometimes downright slovenly.

﻿
﻿Will lied a lot from the beginning of our marriage. About stupid things. Like going to Jack in the Box or meeting a friend for coffee.  We also started out really broke but Will started making more money and becoming more well known in his field. He worked on several big movies before getting on the project that really changed his career and our lives. He went from making semi-okay money and being relatively unknown to making good money and being very well known in his industry. He still lied during this time. At this point, it’s a feature of Will. He works and he lies about things.

Once Will started making good money, he expected me to know how to manage it. When we were broke, we were both involved with the finances and jointly knew nothing and fucked up together. But when he started making good money, he expected me to manage it alone. I should have learned how to do this. I didn’t. I made sure things were paid and that my daughter had everything she needed. When he was on a movie, we could generally stockpile 12k in a couple months without even needing to really cut back. But then the movie would end and he would be off for three months. We would spend that money and sometimes go into debt. Then he would get on a movie and we would spend a few weeks/a month getting out of debt and stockpiling 10-15k again. I didn’t know how to manage finances when I couldn’t anticipate what was coming in. I should have sought outside help but I didn’t see it as a problem till far too late.

Me not driving cost us a lot of money. My daughter was in an expensive sport that had long practices  almost daily and I used Uber/lift to get us there and anywhere else we needed to go. At one point, we were spending close to 1k/month on Uber alone. I don’t blame my choice to not learn to drive on anyone. I don’t even know why I haven’t. All I do know is that I have had years of opportunity and I have not done it. And this choice cost us a lot of money.

I settled into a lot of bad choices. I got tired of fighting about the way his attitude felt like, “Budgets for thee and not for me!” If he didn’t want us to pinch pennies together, then I just wouldn’t pinch pennies either. He was lying to me and was rarely home and I think the truth of it is that living comfortably made that feel okay. Or, maybe not okay but decent. I kind of told myself that I didn’t need to fight about where my husband was or what he was lying about because my daughter had this amazing life and I could be happy with that. Me being dumb as fuck is a running theme here. I recognize that my own stupidity is maybe even the main problem in all of this.

And then comes Pablo.

Pablo(name changed) is a person who worked in pretty much the same field as my husband. He was one of the more famous guys in this industry and had a huge amount of followers on Instagram(something my husband now noticed and talked about). Pablo was athletic. He was single. And he became Will’s best friend.

From the moment Will and Pablo became friends, Will’s attitude toward me changed. It used to feel like we were working things out but I was angry that he kept lying to me. This switched to feeling like Will had this rage that was always bubbling under the surface and would explode during moments of stress. There was one Christmas when I asked him if we could take the money we would normally spend on gifts and use it for a small trip to San Diego. My daughter couldn’t list a single physical thing she wanted that year and only asked to stay in a hotel. When I brought this up to Williams, he lost it. He screamed, “With what money?? With what money??” and literally backed me into a corner while screaming in my face. He’s not tall but I am quite short and he was towering over me as I tried to shrink into a corner while he was screaming at me. He told me that I was pretty much just a nanny because I couldn’t clean or manage finances(both of which I am legitimately terrible at) and he could hire a nanny to replace me. I told him that I could just take our daughter to spend Christmas in Vegas with my mom and he said he wouldn’t pay for it.

After, I tried to talk about how this altercation scared me. Will would have none of it. He mocked me for being scared of him(because he is not a physically intimidating guy and literally EVERYONE else feels safe around him) and told me that I was trying to make him feel like he was abusive. He would only agree to discuss the situation if I was willing to talk about how I pushed him to that point. I was unwilling to talk about it that way because my entire point was that his reaction should have never been an option. My fear was that this was a point that he COULD be pushed to. In order to feel safe, I needed to know that would never happen again. He refused to talk about it further.

During this time, he was working on the biggest movie of his life. It was a huge cultural phenomenon and he found himself going to award shows, doing interviews, and getting invited into rooms that he never thought he would be in. He would invite me to go with him and I just… couldn’t. I am not particularly social by nature but it also felt impossible to stand by someone who I was starting to feel treated me poorly behind closed doors. I know that some people will feel I am overreacting but that altercation felt violent and it was messing with my mind.

Will started feeling angry that I was “abandoning” him when he was finally reaping the rewards of all the years of work he had put into his craft. I felt like I couldn’t stand by him and have people tell me how great he is and how lucky I am to have him when I didn’t feel that way. His refusal to talk about what happened made me feel silenced and standing by him made me feel complicit in that silencing.

I am sorry this is so long. I am trying to condense.

My husband got our daughter an iPad and used his AppleID to set it up. I was sitting with her one day and a semi-naked photo of a woman comes through. It was from Pablo.

I open the messages and see that Pablo is bragging about this woman to my husband and sending photos of her cooking for him. Over the course of several days, I see that Pablo talks about women extensively to my husband. There were detailed accounts of sexual encounters, rating/ranking women, sending photos to my husband that appeared to have been meant solely for Pablo’s eyes. Once, Pablo even described events that ultimately amounted to stalking a woman and showing up at her apartment unannounced. My husband told him that “she knows she misses that dick.” No condemnation. No push back. I hate even typing this out.

I also found out that Pablo had been either fired or forced out of an adjacent industry because of things that happened in relationships with his colleagues. There was a forum online where Pablo was being discussed as a predator and my husband told Pablo that “the white guys were just jealous they can’t compete with your black dick.”

Will is weirdly obsessed with Pablo’s dick. I have never seen anyone else say shit like that.

When Pablo started sending my husband photos that seemed like they were meant just for Pablo’s eyes, I felt it was necessary to tell Will that I had seen them. I told him that Pablo sending intimate photos of women that were intended for his eyes only was a huge breach of trust. I told him that I realized that this wasn’t a conversation I was supposed to be privy to but that his reaction felt disappointing. No one was standing up for those women and telling Pablo to stop. I told him that the things he said were gross and I expected better of him as a married man.

He lost his SHIT. He told me I didn’t want him to have friends, that I was trying to make him look bad, that this is just how guys talk. He latched on the word “gross” and will randomly remind me of how I called him gross, even to this day. I stand by it. It was gross and weird.

This is getting far too long so I’m just going to say that this continues for two-ish years. Pablo does weird shit, my husband co-signs, I protest, he blows up and blames me. They are weird-ass best friends against the world. In an industry of mostly women, mind you. During the fucking Me-too movement.

One day, my husband comes to me and tells me he needs to say something. He says that I have always had great intuition and he should have trusted me. He said that there is a woman who has created an instagram page dedicated to exposing Pablo. Apparently she and other women were uniting because of their experience with Pablo. These women had been stalked, bullied, and threatened with the release of their intimate photos. My husband acted gobsmacked. Why? I don’t know. They literally just wrote down the shit we already knew years ago. But he was pretend gobsmacked and I heard him out. He said he should have listened to me and that it is news to him that Pablo is a bad person. But then he also told me that the woman who started the page is a crazy 22 year old who is doing this to be malicious. That seemed like weird information to know, so I asked him if he had spoken to her. He was like, “no! I would never! That’s crazy.” I accepted that for a while but my gut kept gnawing at me. I told him that I was sorry to ask again but my intuition has never failed me and it was calling bullshit. He looked me in my eye and told me he never spoke to her. He told me how this is probably just a residual feeling that comes from the lies he has told in the past. He told me that even though he picks up the weight of that burden every day, it is hard on him to know I don’t trust him when he is telling the truth. He told me that it is probably even more difficult for me to trust because my father wasn’t in my life but that it’s still hard for him to have to hold that weight. 

Two days later, the girl makes a post calling my husband out for continuing to contact her and threaten her with legal action. Lol. So not only was he calling her, he was trying to silence her, too.

When I brought this up to Will, he said that he only got involved because she is pretending to be a victim and she didn’t really feel taken advantage of, she was just trying to get revenge. She, the 22 year old young woman, was trying to vilify him, the 40 year old married man with all the industry contacts and good reputation. He would only agree to talk about it if we talked about how blindsided he was and how shocked he must be to find out his friend is trash. Wild.

He would also tell me he didn’t have time to discuss any of this with me but would then be in Zooms with other industry people talking about what a betrayal this is and how he was as shocked as they were. Fucking HOW? My husband was pretty much the one person who definitely DID know. And the stupid piety he had afterward was unbearable. There was an award show he was going to and he wanted to wear his Time’s Up pin and asked me to help fasten it to his lapel. I wanted to stab him with it.

I don’t know why this broke me as much as it did. Something inside of me just gave up. I stopped leaving the house. I became so afraid of seeing anyone we jointly knew so I stopped going outside. I hated the thought of being around anyone because the main thing people talk to me about is how amazing he is and how lucky I am. I’m naturally awkward and I make people feel uncomfortable and it started to feel unbearable that the thing people seemed to like most about me is that I am married to him. It made me feel like I was stuck inside skin I couldn’t shed. 

There was also the guilt. My husband knew all of this ahead of time. So did I. Neither of us said shit. I didn’t track those women down on socials and let them know what was being said and shared about them. I just rolled over and let it all happen. Will was getting these messages two years prior to when all of this came out publicly. That was two years of trauma that might not have happened to someone if either of us had said something. But we didn’t and now I feel guilty and Will’s pontificating on the internet so that people will tell him how great he is.

When I have posted about other issues in the past, people say leave the marriage. And I feel that, that resonates with me, but I’ve left my HOUSE like six times in the past six months. My stretch goal in therapy is just going back to the DMV. It was huge progress for me to just get a remote job and talk to people other than my daughter every day. I’m trying to make this as light and silly as I can but I don’t know if I am  also articulating how poorly I am doing mentally. I keep going online and asking people if I am overreacting but I think I am more trying to understand if it is justifiable for me to be as emotionally wrecked as I am. I don’t understand how issues that don’t even sound that bad on their own have fucked me up this badly. My therapist recommended EMDR because she says I have ptsd and that feels wild because how could I have ptsd when nothing has actually happened to me? I can’t even imagine telling anyone in real life because it sounds ridiculous.  Like, as a kid, my mom beat my ass to the point CPS was called repeatedly and I came out of that with just fast reflexes. But I got ptsd while inside my house in the suburbs because my husband lied to me a lot? I’ll have to take that to my gave. 

I can’t wrap my head around how I got here and I don’t know what to do next. My plan so far has been get a job and don’t die and although I am super happy to be able to check those things off, leaving the marriage feels like skipping some steps. 

Absolutely any advice would be appreciated. Is there anyone who thinks this is salvageable? I genuinely don’t know what to do. ",1,1761552777.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

So, I spoke to people getting food at a food bank and here are some things I learned from those in need:

1. Everyone donates Kraft Mac and Cheese in the box. They can rarely use it because it needs milk and butter which is hard to get from regular food banks.

2. Boxed milk is a treasure, as kids need it for cereal which they also get a lot of.

3. Everyone donates pasta sauce and spaghetti noodles.

4. They cannot eat all the awesome canned veggies and soup unless you put a can opener in too or buy pop tops.

5. Oil is a luxury but needed for Rice a-Roni which they also get a lot of.

6. Spices or salt and pepper would be a real Christmas gift.

7. Tea bags and coffee make them feel like you care.

8. Sugar and flour are treats.

9. They fawn over fresh produce donated by farmers and grocery stores.

10. Seeds are cool in Spring and Summer because growing can be easy for some.

11. They rarely get fresh meat.

12. Tuna and crackers make a good lunch.

13. Hamburger Helper goes nowhere without ground beef.

14. They get lots of peanut butter and jelly but usually not sandwich bread.

15. Butter or margarine is nice too.

16. Eggs are a real commodity.

17. Cake mix and frosting makes it possible to make a child’s birthday cake.

18. Dishwashing detergent is very expensive and is always appreciated.

19. Feminine hygiene products are a luxury and women will cry over that.

20. Everyone loves Stove Top Stuffing.

In all the years I have donated food at the Holidays, I bought what I thought they wanted, but have never asked. I am glad I did. If you are helping a Family this Christmas, maybe this can help you tailor it more. It does for me!

**Note:** vitiligo is an auto-immune condition which causes patches of skin to lose pigment or colour. It can be genetic but also triggered by extreme stress or environmental factors; exact cause is unknown. It is not contagious and does not affect the overall physical health. However, it can be emotionally difficult for some as it is visible especially on darker skin tones. Globally, it impacts about 1% of the population.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Original: Nail-noob here 👋 What design/color should I go for?**

Hi all, I’m a brown skinned girlie, who has never been comfortable because of vitiligo.

I’m on my way of acceptance and love me like I am, while continuing to enjoy things that regular beautiful girls do.

Any suggestions what design/color I should go for? My vibe is more tom boyish but I don’t mind doing something elegant either. Please be kind and any guidance/suggestions are welcome 🥹❤️🙏

**Comments:**

**Comment1:** I hope this doesn't come across as rude. Have you considered a Hereford cow print? Respectfully, I love your skin, and if you are of a mind, celebrate it.  
Otherwise, high gloss-gloss coffee brown or dark glossy chocolate. Dark forest green (Glossy of course! And a few rare gold flicks?). I wonder how a matt autumnal mustard would go? All three of these are autumnal, mildly masculine, and should sit well on your skin. Keep them on a short nail for now.

>**OOP:** Not at all, that’s really kind of you to take time and share some suggestions 😊❤️  
I was considering coffee/brown prints, but why not try the Hereford cow print 🥹  
Thanks a lot, I’ll definitely report back to you, how it looks like if I go for it ❤️❤️❤️

**Comment2:** I think a deep ruby red would be gorgeous on you.

>**OOP**: 🥹 thanks for your suggestion. I’ve always stayed away from red shades (even for clothes or makeup) as I thought it wouldn’t suit me but maybe it’s all in my head. I’ll consider it ❤️🙏

**Comment3**: I’m not just saying this. Your skin is absolutely beautiful. How wonderful you are growing more confident because you should be! Show it off. Seriously. One of the most beautiful models is Winnie Harlow and it’s because her skin is so unique and beautiful. Don’t ever hide your self. You *are* a regular beautiful girl!!  
Literally any nail color would work. It’s just a matter of what color you like. Don’t think your skin only looks good with certain colors. Since it’s fall I’d do a beautiful maroon color or an earthy green. :)

**Comment4:** You have beautiful skin and healthy nails. I believe any design or color will look nice. However, getting very long extensions or the designs with lots of 3d stuff might be a little uncomfortable. I suggest starting with short to medium extensions and maybe some glass cat eye. They are very pretty and trendy. When I have them on, I can't stop staring at my nails.

**Comment5**: I think dark autumn colors would look incredible on you, like deep maroon, eggplant, navy, dark green (maybe even a dusky yellow??)

**Update (0.5 -- same day)**

Unable to edit the post, so here’s the EDIT:

Wow, thank you so much everyone for all of these creative ideas - I'm honestly blown away by how amazing and kind this community is!❤️ This thread is a goldmine of ideas, and I am super excited to try these options. I see the 2 most suggested options - a) Hereford cow print and b) Ruby / Dark red. I am leaning more towards the former 🐄💅this time, if the salon artist is confident in doing the print. But I absolutely loved the dark red, autumn, and other suggested tones too - so those are definitely on my list. I really appreciate everyone who commented and shared their kindness with me❤️🫂 I will definitely report back and keep experimenting down the road. Love you all😭❤️🙏

**Update 1 (5 days later) -- I think my nail tech ATE?! What do you think?**

Hey lovely Redditors of this community! ❤️

I just wanted to pop back in and say a huge THANK YOU to everyone who took out time to respond to my previous post with such AMAZING SUGGESTIONS and a lot of kindness 🥹

I ended up following the Hereford cow print suggestion (pictures attached), and I’m so happy with how my nails turned out!

Also, I was so torn between getting dark red or cow print, that I got them both! Cow print in hands and red in toenails 😅

Let me know what you think!

Sending joy and love to you and your partner! I never thought I was capable of love until I met some kind people and it is contagious! I hope that everyone who is a little short of self-love gets to meet such kind souls because it sure makes an impact ❤️😭  
I’m forever grateful to this community!

Real talk: How many hours have you wasted scrubbing through your timeline, hunting down every single ""um,"" ""uh,"" and ""like"" in your recordings?

Because I used to spend hours editing a 15-minute video just removing filler words. It was mind-numbing.

Then I started using VEED's Filler Remover feature and honestly? I can't go back. It's one of those things where once you use it, manual editing feels prehistoric.

**The workflow is insanely simple:**

1. Upload your video to VEED
2. Audio tab → Clean Audio → Filler Word Remover
3. Hit ""Remove filler words"" – AI scans the whole thing in like 30 seconds
4. You get a full list of every filler word it detected 
5. Review the list and uncheck anything you want to keep
6. Apply, export, done

**Here's what really interesting:**

The first time I ran it, I thought ""eh, I probably say 'um' like 10-15 times.""

Nope. **47 times.** In a 12-minute video. FORTY-SEVEN.

I didn't believe it until I saw the transcript. We're all out here sounding like broken records and don't even realize it.

**What makes this actually useful:**

✅ **You stay in control** – It doesn't auto-delete everything. You review first, which is clutch because sometimes you WANT that pause for emphasis

✅ **The cuts are clean** – No weird audio gaps or robotic chops. It's smooth enough that viewers won't notice

✅ **Saves your butt on client work** – When you're on a deadline and need to sound polished FAST

✅ **Shows you patterns** – You'll start noticing your verbal crutches. Mine is ""so"" at the start of every sentence apparently

✅ **Works on any format** – Doesn't matter if it's MP4, MOV, whatever

**My actual editing routine now:**

* Record video (still say ""um"" 50 times because I'm human)
* Upload to VEED
* Run filler remover while I grab coffee
* Quick review (2 mins max)
* Do my other edits (cuts, text, music, etc.)
* Export

What used to take 3+ hours now takes like 45 minutes total.

**Quick heads up though:**

This works best for **professional/polished content**. If you're doing casual vlogs or want that authentic ""talking to a friend"" vibe, you might want to keep some filler words. They make you sound more human.

Also – and this is key – **always review before applying**. Sometimes ""um"" is mid-word (""umbrella,"" ""dumbbell,"" etc.) or the pause is intentional. Takes 2 minutes to skim through and can save you from awkward cuts.

**Real world results:**

My last video: 8 minutes long, had 38 filler words removed. Video feels tighter, more professional, and my watch time actually went UP because people aren't sitting through awkward pauses.

Client project last week: 20-minute presentation. Would've taken me half a day to manually clean. Done in under an hour.

If you do any kind of talking-head content, tutorials, video podcasts, or professional videos... seriously, try this. It's one of those ""wish I'd known about this sooner"" things.

What's your editing workflow like? Anyone else automate parts of their process or are you still doing everything manually?",1,1761552296.0,VEED_Community,0,1.0,False

I've been seeing these groups hangout a lot at coffee shops - mostly
1. Starbucks - Inorbit 
2. Third Wave Coffee - Banjara Hills and Himayat Nagar 3. Near True Black- ( The Loft, Hitech)

I almost got into the scam but I got my money back. Still, I lost so much money into repaying the interest for the loan I took, thank god I'm finally out of it and closed my loan.

But I don't know how to raise awareness about this, it's becoming so bad that I can instantly recognise if they're part of the qnet group - and I'm seeing more groups these days. 

How do we bring this matter to attention with someone who can actually take action against them? 

I just wanted to say it's so sad to see so many young people who just started earning - be part of these groups. 

Will tell how the scam happened with me and others in the comments - Edit - I don't have to tell I guess, just search for qnet in this sub, it's the same process, every single step. ",2,1761552057.0,hyderabad,1,1.0,False

He thinks Chloe set him up but she didn't. He's being a bit bitter that she's enjoying the holiday when she used to hate it, and Chloe says she deserves to be happy on Valentine's Day after having to witness the train wreck that was Clark and Lana. Clark says that Chloe is the only person who can make him feel guilty, relieved, and sad in one sentence. I think the guilt is for putting her through the emotional wringer in high school, the relief is for her not holding that against him and being the best friend she can be to him, and the sad is once again the fact that he never felt the same way. Chloe assures Clark that his heart will heal one day, but Clark is skeptical. She says to give it a little more time and, ""You never know when the next love of your life is right around the corner."" This is the second time that Chloe has referred to Lana as the love of Clark's life, that I can recall at least. And Clark, although he waxes poetic about how much he loves Lana and wants to be with her for the rest of his life, I don't think he ever actually calls her the love of his life. That is reserved for Lois and Lois alone. And who should be right around the corner after Chloe makes that statement? Why Lois Lane of course, who is having even less fun than Clark lol. Jimmy brought her to the Talon to cheer her up after her breakup with Oliver. He's just as into Valentine's Day as Chloe, and he kisses her, with Clark looking like an awkward 3rd wheel in the background. Chloe is surprised that Jimmy brought Lois, but Clark wastes no time with his sarcasm, which Lois reciprocates. Chloe takes Jimmy aside, annoyed that he brought Lois. 
But Jimmy says it hit him. ""Lois and Clark."" Chloe is incredulous. Jimmy says they have chemistry (completely agree with that Jimmy) but Chloe says so do nitroglycerin and peroxide, and I get the feeling that it's a very negative reaction to put those two things together. But technically she goes along with it seeing as she and Jimmy abandon Lois and Clark. They stand next to each other awkwardly before both realizing pretty much at the same time that they've just been set up. Lois says that is crazy, comparing them as a pair to hot fudge and halibut. Clark looks confused at first, but then he gets it, saying a bit irritated, ""I take it I'm the halibut."" Lois confirms, and Clark isn't in the mood for their normal snarking, so he leaves. Enter Star, with our magical elixir of a love potion and red K laced lipstick. She tells Lois this will make her fall in love with the first man she sets eyes on, but I think it's open for interpretation that there have to be underlying feelings there already for the elixir to work. It's never been confirmed, but that's my theory on why it works so thoroughly for Lois. She puts on the lipstick, sees Clark, smiles and says his name.

Martha RSVP's for Lex and Lana's engagement party, which seems cold but a deleted scene shows that she didn't have the heart to say no to Lana, but I know Annette O'Toole wasn't a fan of the choice to have Martha go. But she wants to know how the party went last night for Clark and he's sarcastic again. Martha tries to talk to him, but he doesn't want any more love advice, although he's very sweet with her and thanks her for the concern. Someone knocks at the door, and Martha goes to open it. And here's Lois, looking very different than we normally see her. Thigh high boots, a denim mini skirt, a revealing teal blouse and a black jacket complete her ensemble, with Lois reapplying that magical lipstick. Martha is speechless for a few seconds, before regaining her composure. Lois wants to know if Clark is there, and Martha says he is and lets her in. Clark knows it's Lois, but he hadn't looked at her at that point so did he know it was her by the sound of her walking, or did he hear Martha say it was Lois, or was it both? I like to think it was a bit of both myself. But Clark is trying to apologize for Jimmy trying to set them up the night before, and he mentions ""after Oliver"" before he is stunned speechless. I feel like that means that he and Lois have talked about it and he would know her emotional state after the breakup. But I counted and Clark is speechless for 42 seconds. He looks her up and down before going back to her face, and Lois says that Oliver is history. Clark looks a bit confused and looks to his mom for some clarification but Martha has none. Lois asks if she and Clark can have a couple of minutes, and the woman bites her lip. Martha, the shipper she is is like, ""Yeah. Um, I-I'll be upstairs."" She leaves and Clark is left still looking at Lois, giving her yet another waterfall look. He smiles but he is still very confused as to why Lois is acting this way. Lois struts up to him, taking the pitcher Clark had been holding in his hand and setting it on the counter. She says they're all alone now, and Clark is looking at Lois like he's in a trance. He sways with her, completely captivated, but again he is still very confused. Lois strokes his hand, and she wonders how she never noticed what big strong hands Clark had. This is when Clark finally finds his voice again. He smiles, giggles (again with the giggling this woman evokes in him), removes his hand and takes a step back, wanting to know what's going on. Lois says she's not good with words and proceeds to give Clark the famous mix CD. Before he looks down, it almost looks like Clark thinks something different is about to happen but I can't quite tell. He sees the CD, but is still confused why she made it for him. Lois mentions White Snake having power ballads, but if you pause it and look at the track list, there actually isn't any White Snake on that CD. I'll suspend my disbelief though because I love every bit of this scene. Then Lois gives up my favorite innocuous detail about her, that she secretly loves slow-dancing with a guy's big and strong arms around her like Clark's, closing the distance he made and wrapping his big and strong arms around her, and biting her lip again. Clark keeps looking at her like she has the secrets of the universe, hanging on every word. He flexes his hands on Lois' back, and it looks like he's going to give in, he is very into what is happening, but he smiles and gulps before coming to his senses. I think at this point he doesn't think Lois would ever be into him, she basically called him a cold fish the night before, and he can't trust that something isn't going on.  So he takes one hand off and tells her to put the CD on, licking his lips after he said it( Tom, sir, that is too much!). Lois says ok, Clark stands there for a moment, rooted to the spot, watching her. His other hand stays on her back and only moves away because she moves away. And once she's moved away enough, after she starts to tease him about his dance moves, Clark superspeeds out of there, all the way to Metropolis. Like there should be a Clark-shaped smoke outline like in cartoons lol. He left so damn fast.

I know it's probably supposed to be seen as progress that Lana isn't pushing to know Clark's secret, but the fact that she wants confirmation from Chloe of there being a secret in the first place is still not cool to me.

Clark is ready for Valentine's Day to be over, and Chloe deflects on why she was late to meet him, telling him she dug into their favorite Martian Manhunter, but Clark wants to talk about another manhunter, a more immediate manhunter. Lois. Chloe makes a joke about Lois wielding an axe at every man in Metropolis, but Clark says she's only after one man. Chloe looks confused, so Clark clarifies with, ""Lois is...into me."", gulping once again at that thought. Chloe is still confused so Clark presents the CD in such a hilarious way, like this is such a huge sign of something horribly wrong. He says she's not herself and it's like she overdosed on Love Potion number 9 and is this a clue that Clark secretly likes romcoms? But Chloe laughs, and Clark doesn't think this situation isn't very funny. He says theu have to find out what happened before Lois strikes again. Too late, Lois is there, not upset at the least that she had to look everywhere for Clark. Clark has the same look that he has when he sees Lois in the bunny costume in Charade, sort of a mouth shape and eye brows raised look. Lois shows Clark the tattoo she got and suggests that he gets one to match, and Clark and Chloe are shocked, and Chloe is officially worried and is going to look into it. Clark doesn't want Chloe to leave him alone with Lois, but Lois stops him from leaving. She strokes his chest, his hair, his face, and Clark can't handle it now that he's certain it's not really Lois, so he grabs her by the hand to lead her somewhere else, but Lois has other ideas and she pulls him into a phone booth. She calls him adorable with his modesty, and Clark wants to know what happened with Lois after he left the night before. The Man of Steel is breathing pretty heavily too. Lois says she went home alone but that he knows where she really wanted to be, and then she kisses him. Now technically this isn't something Clark wanted and he actually looks kind of scared right before she kisses him, and this is when he just stands there because he doesn't want to kiss Lois when she's not in her right mind. And if that is all it had been, my guess is that Clark would have probably been able to resist. But the glorious thing called Red Kryptonite is about to take the wheel and Clark no longer cares about anything but making out with Lois. He gets that cocky glimmer in his eyes and smirks, pushing her against the wall in the phone booth, and goes in for the kiss and my god it is steamy. It's too short, but watching it over and over again(for research purposes), the sequence of events is Clark puts one of his hands on Lois' face and threads it into her hair, kissing her deeply. His other hand is at her back, holding her tightly to him. Lois is holding onto Clark's shoulders for dear life lol. Oh and I should mention that Love Potion number 9 Lois is all smiles when it comes to Clark, manufactured or not, she has never grinned this much.

Ok so time wise, it's safe to say that Lois and Clark make out for a while in that phone booth before they come up to an office to do more than make out. Time is funky on Smallville, but if Lois showed up in the morning to the Kent farm, and technically Metropolis is a few hours away, and Chloe sees Lana at her Talon apartment before meeting Clark, it's maybe noon when Lois gets to the Daily Planet. It's February which means it gets dark around 6, and after this scene, the rooftop scene is very dark. So by that logic, Lois and Clark have been making out for hours.

Clark takes Lois to an office and she says he can do better than that. He shoves almost everything off the desk and says he was planning on it, and I wonder what red K Clark was planning. I don't think he had the idea to go to Oliver's place at that point, but maybe that was always his goal? They're too close up to really tell hand placement, but I think Clark puts his arms around Lois after he prowls around the desk, intent on kissing Lois again, but she wants to know that there are real feelings involved, saying it's a bit sudden that after one kiss he likes her. Clark, after shamelessly checking her out, iust chuckles and smiles and goes in to kiss her again, but Lois again wants confirmation that this is real. Clark, in the most unconvincing voice says that it couldn't be more real, and they start making out again, but Lois stops it again because she's noticed something. She's kissed Clark before. He's Green Arrow! When she mentions the alley, that is literally the same look Clark gives Lois on the rooftop in Homecoming when she says she would do anything for him. It's an awed look with stars in his eyes, like Lois is the most precious person to him. But Clark doesn't care about outing Oliver, telling Lois he was pretending to be Green Arrow so she didn't know it was really him. He goes back in again for another kiss, but that information takes Lois out of her love daze for a bit, and she pushes him away, walking to the window and wondering aloud what is her deal with emotionally unavailable weekend warriors. Clark looks annoyed but he is not giving up, which to me shows that despite later events, even red K Clark handles Lois differently. If it was any other woman being this challenging, red K Clark would have moved onto a different one. But he stays with Lois, and he pulls a move that is so swoon-worthy. As Lois stands at the window, Clark comes up behind her, slides his hands up under her jacket and around her waist, and rests his chin on her shoulder, nuzzling her hair. Lois smiles and is thankful she finally found a normal guy, but Clark doesn't like that at all, saying Oliver isn't even in the same league as him. Lois thinks he's just trying to be macho and she says she doesn't need it and likes the dorky farm boy thing. But Clark is so annoyed that she still sees him like that, and he digs at Oliver wanting to know if he's dorkier than a hood and a quiver. He's very sensitive about this, and says just because he doesn't wear a costume and show his face all over the papers, but he's interrupted before he finishes that sentence. I feel like maybe he was going to say that he's just as heroic as Oliver, but Lois cuts him off and says the wrong thing again, that she doesn't care if his signature move is driving a tractor, and she thinks it's adorable. But Clark has had enough. He wants to impress Lois so bad and show her he's better than Oliver, so he says, ""You know, Lois, I think that it's time for you to meet the real Clark Kent."" And Lois is beaming, happy to do anything for Clark, to see any side of him. Clark has been making out with Lois for some hours, and he's already ready to tell her his secret. But yet, he still won't tell anyone else, especially Lex and Lana. *In-te-rest-ing.*

While Lois and Clark are having red K fun, Lana is being terrified by Lex's nursery that is too soon. I get her reasoning on why she doesn't want people to find out, but I do think there is a tiny part of her that isn't quite in denial but doesn't want to fully deal with the reality of her being pregnant. I also think that while she backtracks it later in saying Clark is the only man she's ever really loved, Lana truly did love Lex at one point.

Clark brings Lois to the rooftop of the Daily Planet, and Lois doesn't understand why they're up there. Clark points out Oliver's balcony in the distance, and he climbs up on the ledge. Lois wants him to come down, but Clark wants her up there with him, pulling her up like she weighs nothing, and Lois is a bit freaked. Clark pulls her into him, looks at her again with that adoring look, says, ""I'd like to see Oliver do this."", and jumps. Lois holds onto him with a death grip, but she isn't afraid, and she smiles at him. They land, he swings her around, and Lois is delighted. But Clark is still thinking about what she said and he says, ""What'd you say about a dorky farm boy?"" Clark pushes open the doors of Oliver's penthouse like the drama king we all know he is. Lois is talking about his leap, wondering what else Clark can do while he is once again unabashedly checking her out. Clark gets very suggestive. ""Well I'm fast. But not too fast."" And he grabs Lois' hand and pulls her in front of him. Lois leans against the clock in the window with her arms splayed, and says Clark is being very bad, mentioning that the last time she was in that apartment she was with a good friend of his. Clark is suggestive again with, ""Obviously, he wasn't that good."" Lois is loving every second of this, first pushing and then pulling Clark to her, to make out with him once again. Jackets and a shirt go flying, and then Clark utters the title for this post. ""I better make sure you didn't spell my name wrong"" and dear Lord it just keeps getting hotter and hotter lol with Clark ripping Lois' shirt to see the tattoo on her chest. This is one of my absolute favorite quotes because we all know Lois is a notoriously bad speller, and Clark is using that to hardcore flirt with her and it makes me think that red K Clark is more like Clark around Lois than he realizes, because why would red K Clark care about that little detail about Lois. But Lois is so turned on by everything about Clark and this is just one more thing. He picks her up bridal style, and swings her around before setting her on a chair. He crawls up her body, and Lois grabs the railing above her head. Clark finishes what he started at the clock, and rips the rest of Lois' shirt wide open, revealing a bustier I think? Lois jumps in anticipation, and there is a moment right before the inevitable happens that shows Clark relishing in this moment. He's enjoying teasing Lois, and he has one of those special smiles for her, brushing her nose with his. But then. He sees the invitation for the engagement party and he's not thinking about erasing Oliver from Lois' mind, he's thinking about the 2 people that have betrayed him the most and his anger and ego take over his libido. Lois is upset that he stopped but she tries to compose herself. Clark isn't surprised he wasn't invited, and Lois says she RSVP'd before Oliver left but she found a better way to occupy her night, and she comes up behind Clark and rests her chin on his shoulder. Clark however wants to crash the party. And once again, I don't see this as a gotcha moment for Clark choosing Lana over Lois. Because there is no way that the powers that be would be ok with Lois and Clark's first time on the show to be under a red K influence, and the restrictions are still in place, the red K was a workaround but Lois and Clark aren't ready to be together. So none of what happens proves anything for me when it comes to Clark and Lana, other than they are seriously the worst for each other.

Chloe's got a lead on why Lois is acting the way she is, but Jimmy thinks Lois and Clark made a love connection because of him. Chloe is still incredulous, and Jimmy accuses her of being jealous, and Chloe does not convince me that she's not jealous of Lois, even if it's more than just because of the sparks she saw between them. Jimmy thinks Chloe should go to the engagement party, saying ""Clark's a big boy, how much damage can Lois really do?"" Oh Jimmy, you have no idea lol. But Chloe delegates, and has Jimmy go see Star about turning Lois back. Her description is funny though, ""Tall, loud, down on love?"" She does have an antidote to the love potion, but we get another one of those foreshadowing lines. ""Something tells me Lois and Clark's destinies are a little more entwined than they realize."" And Jimmy smiles because he is so team Clois.

I absolutely love that not only did red K Clark not ditch Lois, something that season 2 or 3 or even 4 red K Clark might have done, they are wearing coordinating outfits when they crash the engagement party. And Clark, inhibition free, lets it all out. He busts in again just like he did at Oliver's, pushing both doors in and he's off! He's upset his mother would go to this party and he sees how close she's become with Lionel and doesn't like it. Martha's facial expressions are so good here when Clark is talking. He then moves onto Chloe and is upset she is there as well but for an entirely different reason than Martha. He thinks she's there because if Lana is unavailable, maybe she thinks deep down Clark will be able to fall for her, and he drops the bomb that he indeed has thought about being with her. Lois does not like hearing that and she doesn't like the way Clark is acting. Clark moves onto Lana, accusing her of only being with Lex to hurt Clark. Lex tries to get Clark to leave and he yells, ""I'm not done yet!"". I'm sure it says something about me that I find Clark yelling so hot, but I can't help it lol. He then drops the bomb on people that Lana is pregnant and he thinks that's the real reason Lana is marrying Lex. After pushing Lex into the champagne glasses piled on top of each other, Clark basically kidnaps Lana on the grounds of saving her from Lex, but not before one final dagger. Lois stops him, saying ""I don't think so. Lana is your past. I'm your future."" And Clark replies in a line so good but so cutting and I am conflicted with how much like it, ""This is the present."" That kind of destroys Lois, and she doesn't try to go after them.

Lois has finished at least one of the desserts after feeling rejected by Clark. Martha and Chloe have figured out that Clark got exposed to red K, and Chloe found out from Jimmy that it was Lois' lipstick. But Martha doesn't understand why it's still affecting him once he's away from Lois. We see Lois finishing her second dessert, which I love for her. Chloe says, ""I think Lois' kisses were a little more than skin deep. I think it's in his system."" This line fascinates me. Does she mean they kissed so much, that French kissing is the culprit, that Lois did more than just kiss, the possibilities are endless! I'm gonna say that all that making out, there was definitely French kissing involved and it got into his system that way. I would say that Lois bit him a little and that's how it got in his system, because that sounds just frisky enough lol, but she wouldn't be able to break his skin so I know it wasn't that. Lois is still reflecting on what happened, telling herself, ""He wasn't good enough for me anyway"", before grabbing her 3rd dessert. Martha runs to take care of Clark, and Jimmy shows up with the antidote. Lois says, ""What does she have that I don't?"" Absolutely nothing Lois Lane. Just you wait. Jimmy is weirded out by seeing her act like such a girl. Chloe goes to end the spell, but Lois doesn't like how flippant Chloe is being, and she pushes her down and Jimmy saves the antidote. Lois is tired of Chloe's jealousy though and she says, ""Just because you never got Clark doesn't mean you need to take it out on me."" So true. Jimmy sprays Lois, and she's back. She immediately doesn't understand why she's there or why she's wearing what she's wearing.

I find it hilarious that after all of that, Clark either has a bike to take Lana to the farm, or they just walk, because he doesn't show her his abilities. They have one of their patent angsty talks and Clark says he just wants Lana to be happy. I kind of wonder if Clark would have reacted this way on red K if Lana was with anyone other than Lex. We know from Apocalypse that as long as Lana is happy, Clark doesn't need to be with her. But it's the Lex of it all that he can't let go of, and his ego isn't helping. He accuses Lana of still being in love with him, claims he's still in love with her, and he kisses her but for me it's not a good one. It's borderline nonconsensual, and all about Clark's ego and not his feelings. Plus there is the shot of Lana fighting it at first before sinking into it, her engagement ring prominently displayed. He tells her not to marry Lex, but to marry him, and that is her breaking point, which I kind of understand, because even now he doesn't seem like he has any intention of telling her the truth. She pushes against him and it's one of those rare times he doesn't go with it, and Lana kind of bounces right off him. She tearfully tells Clark she's given him every chance to say something, she's stood in that spot, the angsty barn conversation spot ™ just waiting for him to say something and he does it now? Clark is unmoved though, and he says nothing. She then says he doesn't love her, he just can't stand the idea that she loves someone else, and I think that is definitely true, especially this version of Clark. And there was an interview somewhere, maybe on Talkville where Kristin Kreuk said that none of Lana's love interests truly loved her or something to that effect, which backs this up. Lex shows up and red K Clark outdoes himself, outing the fact that Lana would rather be with Clark and that she kissed him. Lana says she's not a competition, but Clark says she is to Lex and that he's always wanted everything Clark has ever had and that Lana was at the top of that list. He then says, ""You're just a trophy to him. And he's nothing but your consolation prize."" Damn Clark. He keeps pushing after that though and wants Lana to tell him she doesn't love him, and Lana can't do it. The one time she most definitely should have, the words just don't come and Lex is there to witness it. Clark repeats himself, but Lex pulls out a gun. But Clark is like, ""You don't wanna do that. You can't win. You don't even know the rules of the game."" He pushes Lex through a wall in the barn and tells Lex that if he'd have known who he was going to turn out to be, he never would have saved him on that bridge. Lana tries to stop Clark but there is so much rage behind his eyes and he ignores her, intent on killing Lex. Lex grabs a chisel and stabs Clark, right at the same time that Martha shows up with some good ole fashioned kryptonite. Perfect timing. She tells Lana to take Lex, but Lana saw the chisel and how bent it became. That won't have any repercussions though, right. Clark is back to being Clark, and Martha holds him. 

Clark can't believe what he did while on red K, but Martha can. She said he's bottled up things for years, always doing what's best for other people, but never thinking about what's best for Clark. He says, ""Mom, you don't think I really meant those things I said about you and Chloe."" But Martha thinks there's a grain of truth in all of it. She says red kryptonite doesn't change who he is but it strips his inhibitions, and that he needs to be more honest about how he feels. Clark presses, saying ""So...you're saying that I wanna kiss Lois and keep Chloe in my back pocket while the whole time I'm still in love with Lana?"" Interesting that he mentioned Lois first, although she was the unknowing catalyst for it all. Martha says that's for him to sort out. I think what it means, is that he is attracted to Lois is a confusing way because she is not what he ever pictured, and he thinks he has firmly put her in the friend category. And with Chloe, it's like he wants to put her on the back burner in case his feelings change. It's one of the more selfish things Clark almost unconsciously does. And as for Lana, he's still not willing to give up on both Lana and the life she represents. I love how done Martha is with Clark and his feelings for Lana. He says he can't let her marry Lex, and she borderline rolls her eyes at him before telling him to leave her alone.

Lois walks in, wanting to get Clark to fill in the blanks of her ""Lois Gone Wild"" adventure. And after the angst and pining and yearning, it's nice to get fun and teasing Clark again. At first it's very awkward, and Clark doesn't really know how to act, and I wonder if he thinks she remembers stuff? But she says she's missing a few details ""about us"" and Clark gulps. Lois the reveals the tattoo, and that eases Clark's mind on Lois not knowing anything I guess because he smiles and teases her, ""Wow, Lois, I had no idea."" She says she was obviously on something and that at least it's a temporary tattoo that will be gone within a week. She sighs, but then it gets awkward again and she mentions it's a good thing they both don't remember, and she says she can't really picture the two of them...and she trails off. Clark raises his eyebrows and tilts his head as if he has no idea what she's talking about. She asks Clark, ""You don't think that we..."" and she trails off again. Clark is thoroughly enjoying this turn of events, happy to get back to their status quo of annoying each other. He steps closer to her and has such a big grin when he says, ""Think that we what?"" Lois however is irritated with his obtuseness so she tries again. ""You know...that we..."", nodding her head a few times and thinking the implication is obvious, but Clark is having too much fun with this, and he just laughs and leans in while lifting his eyebrows. Lois then lifts her eyebrows and lifts up her shoulders, and Clark finally puts her out of her misery. ""No Lois. I think I'd remember."" Lois is relieved but not sure how to feel about Clark saying he'd remember, but I think she's in agreement that if that ever happened, for the right reason, she'd want to to be remembered and to be special. But she can't let Clark truly know that, so she just goes with, ""Yeah. Of course you would. Highlight of your life."" She goes to leave, but Clark stops her by saying he found something. Clark just had to tease Lois one last time. He pulls out the mix CD, saying he thinks she made it for him, knowing she did. But it backfires because instead of his teasing making Lois volley back, she gets serious. White Snake is special to Lois, so she says, ""Wow. I must have really liked you."" This wipes the grin right off of Clark's face. He understands that is a vulnerable reveal of Lois' so he stops with the teasing. They share some prolonged eye contact, and an understanding of sorts that they both need the status quo to remain, but Clark has seen past Lois' walls for a moment. And while technically all their moments were fabricated through the red K, this moment was real and there could be something real between them if they ever went there for real, as improbable as that notion is to both.

Jimmy and Chloe break up, and Chloe is seeing firsthand how much Clark's secret might demand of her, but it's a price she is willing to pay. I really wish Clark didn't come between them so much and it was just normal relationship problems, but that's just me.

Lana and Lex have a conversation that revolves around Clark once again, and Lana seems really upset that Lex might have shot Clark to protect her, and it's starting to dawn on her what she's given up and I think she's feeling some buyer's remorse. We get our first inkling that Lana's pregnancy isn't on the up and up and soon it will come time for me to have sympathy for Lana. But not quite, because she went back to the farm and grabbed that dented chisel and she is clearly not going to let it go until she discovers Clark's secret. If he wasn't so evil, I'd say she and Lex are perfect for each other.

Lois calls Clark Smallville - 40

Clark smiles this episode - 27

Lois/Clark wear the same shirt - 15

Lois punches Clark - 7(I'm counting the smack when she thinks he's Green Arrow as well as the tap when they talk in the barn towards the end of the episode)

Lois and Clark hug - 2(new category! And I know that technically this is the first hug, but I always count that one in Gone, even if it's a fake hug so Lois can whisper in Clark's ear.)

Ok that is a wrap on Crimson! Lots of things happening, lots of fun hjinks and drama and just an overall great episode! I might even watch it again now that I won't have to pause it and rewatch 10 seconds five times lol. And eventually I'll go back to these mostly just being about Lois and Clark, but season 6 is so dramatic and soap opera-y and everything is intertwined so it's harder to separate.

**Tuesday, March 14th, 2047**
**Millbrook, Idaho - Population: 3,847**

The coffee in Dr. Maya Reeves's hand had gone cold two hours ago, but she kept lifting it to her lips anyway. Muscle memory. A pantomime of normalcy in a room where normal had packed its bags and left without forwarding address.

""Tell me again about the child,"" she said.

Sheriff Tom Brennan looked like he hadn't slept since Saturday. Probably hadn't. His uniform was wrinkled, and there was a tremor in his right hand that he kept trying to hide by gripping his pen too tightly.

""Which time?"" he asked. ""Because I've told this story forty-seven times now, and it hasn't gotten any less insane.""

Maya set down the cup and leaned forward in the uncomfortable plastic chair. They'd set her up in the Millbrook Elementary School cafeteria—neutral ground, Brennan called it. Somewhere the affected could gather without feeling institutionalized. Through the windows, Maya could see them: nearly two hundred townspeople sitting on the brown grass of the soccer field, many holding hands, some crying quietly. Some staring at nothing.

Or at something only they could see.

""Start from the beginning,"" Maya said, activating her recorder. ""Saturday morning. The first sighting.""

Brennan nodded slowly. ""March 11th, 5:47 AM. Laurie Chen calls dispatch. Says there's a little girl standing in the middle of Route 29, just standing there in her nightgown. Laurie nearly hit her.""

""But when the deputy arrived—""

""Nothing. No girl. No tire marks. Laurie's car is fine—no swerving, no braking. But Laurie's hysterical, absolutely convinced she saw this kid."" Brennan flipped through his notebook, though Maya suspected he had it memorized. ""Asian features, maybe eight years old, white nightgown with yellow flowers. Bare feet. Just standing there, looking right at her.""

""And then?""

""Then Tom Matsuda calls in at 6:15. Same girl, same location. He's on his morning run. Says she spoke to him.""

Maya's pen stopped. ""That's not in the initial report.""

""Because Tom didn't tell us until Sunday. He was... embarrassed."" Brennan's jaw tightened. ""She asked him if he could see her. When he said yes, she smiled and said 'good.' Then she was gone. Not walked away. Gone.""

The recorder's red light blinked steadily. Maya had reviewed preliminary reports on the flight from Boston, but sitting here, watching the late afternoon sun slant through the cafeteria windows, the wrongness felt tactile. Oppressive.

""By Saturday afternoon?"" she prompted.

""By Saturday afternoon, we had forty-three people who'd seen her. Different locations. Different times. But always the same girl. Same nightgown. Same bare feet."" Brennan stood abruptly, walked to the window. ""Sunday, we hit ninety. Monday, one-seventy. This morning, two-oh-three.""

""All describing identical details.""

""Down to the freckle on her left cheek. Down to the chip in her front tooth."" He turned back to Maya. ""Dr. Reeves, I've lived in Millbrook my whole life. I know these people. I know when someone's lying, when they're confused, when they're drunk. This isn't that.""

""What is it, then?""

""That's what the CDC wants to know. That's what Homeland Security wants to know. That's what you're here to figure out."" His voice dropped. ""That's what I need to know before this entire town loses its goddamn mind.""

Through the window, Maya watched a woman in her sixties rock back and forth, arms wrapped around herself. A teenage boy sat perfectly still, staring at something in his cupped hands. Empty hands.

""Can I talk to them?"" Maya asked.

""That's why you're here. But Dr. Reeves?"" Brennan met her eyes. ""Be careful. Half the docs who've interviewed them have started seeing her too.""

---

The first subject was Jennifer Park, forty-two, high school math teacher. She sat across from Maya in what had been the music room, surrounded by child-sized chairs and a dusty piano. Her hands were folded neatly on the table between them. She looked tired but calm. Too calm.

""When did you first see her, Jennifer?""

""Saturday. 2:17 PM. I was grading papers in my kitchen."" Jennifer's voice was steady, matter-of-fact. ""I looked up, and she was standing by my refrigerator.""

""Were you frightened?""

""No."" Jennifer frowned slightly, as if the question puzzled her. ""I should have been, shouldn't I? A strange child in my house. But I wasn't. She felt... expected. Like I'd been waiting for her.""

Maya made a note. Anomalous emotional response. Consistent with previous subjects.

""What did she do?""

""She asked me if I believed in her.""

The air in the room seemed to thicken. Maya kept her expression neutral, professional. ""What did you say?""

""I said yes. Because she was right there. How could I not believe in her?"" Jennifer's eyes focused on something past Maya's shoulder. ""Then she said, 'That's good. You'll need to remember that.'""

""Remember what?""

""That she's real."" Jennifer's gaze snapped back to Maya, suddenly sharp. ""Even when they tell you she's not. Even when they show you the proof. She's real, Dr. Reeves. I know how this sounds. I know what mass hysteria is. I teach critical thinking to tenth graders."" Her voice cracked. ""But she's real.""

Maya interviewed six more people over the next two hours. A mechanic. A barista. A retired dentist. A seventeen-year-old honor student. Each told the same story with minor variations. Each described the same impossible child. Each conveyed the same absolute certainty.

By the time Maya stepped outside for air, the sun was setting, painting Millbrook in shades of amber and shadow. She checked her phone—three missed calls from Dr. Sarah Chen, her department chair at MIT. One text from her mother: *Call me. It's about Naomi.*

Maya stared at that message for a long moment before deleting it. She couldn't think about her sister right now. Couldn't let that complication bleed into this investigation.

""Dr. Reeves?""

She turned. A man in his thirties, thin and anxious, stood a few feet away. He wore a Millbrook Hardware baseball cap and kept glancing over his shoulder.

""Can I help you?""

""I'm David Ortiz. I... I haven't reported it yet. What I saw.""

Maya's pulse quickened. ""Why not?""

""Because I didn't see the girl."" David stepped closer, lowering his voice. ""Saturday morning, 6 AM, I was opening the store. And I saw... something else. Something wrong.""

""Wrong how?""

""The sky."" He looked up at the deepening twilight. ""For about thirty seconds, the sky was purple. Not sunrise purple. Wrong purple. And there were... shapes in it. Geometric. Moving."" He laughed nervously. ""I sound insane.""

""You sound like someone who saw something they can't explain,"" Maya said carefully. ""Did anyone else see it?""

""That's the thing. My wife was right next to me. She didn't see anything. And then I saw the girl too, later that day. Like everyone else. So I figured maybe I was just... I don't know. Primed for weird experiences. Stress hallucination.""

Maya pulled out her tablet. ""Would you be willing to describe exactly what you saw? The shapes, the colors, everything?""

As David talked, Maya sketched. Strange angles. Impossible colors that he struggled to name. And underneath it all, a growing unease that had nothing to do with professional concern.

Because she'd seen something too.

Just for a moment, driving into Millbrook that afternoon. A flicker in her peripheral vision—the mountains in the distance had seemed to invert, peaks becoming valleys, valleys becoming peaks. She'd blinked, and it was gone.

She'd told herself it was fatigue. Twenty hours of travel. The stress of the assignment.

But now, listening to David Ortiz describe a sky that shouldn't exist, Maya felt the first cold finger of doubt trace down her spine.

What if mass hallucination wasn't the answer?

What if something was actually wrong with reality here?

---

Maya's hotel room was a study in rural American mediocrity: beige walls, landscape paintings of places that looked nothing like Idaho, a TV bolted to the dresser. She sat on the edge of the bed, laptop open, reviewing the day's recordings.

Two hundred and three people couldn't share the same delusion. The literature was clear. Mass psychogenic illness required suggestion, anxiety, a vector of transmission. But this had started simultaneously across Millbrook, no patient zero, no clear stressor.

Unless the stressor was environmental.

She opened a new search: *Millbrook Idaho water contamination*. Nothing recent. *Chemical spills*. Nothing. *Military installations*. The nearest was Mountain Home Air Force Base, over a hundred miles away.

Her phone buzzed. Sarah Chen. Maya hesitated, then answered.

""You've been dodging my calls,"" Sarah said without preamble.

""I've been working.""

""In Idaho. On a case that smells like career suicide."" Sarah's voice was fond but firm. ""Maya, this has CDC written all over it. Probably ergot poisoning or industrial contamination. Why are you wasting your time?""

""Because it doesn't fit ergot. Doesn't fit anything."" Maya stood, paced to the window. Millbrook stretched out below, quiet and dark. Too quiet. ""Two hundred people, Sarah. Seeing the same specific, detailed hallucination. Neurologically, that's—""

""Impossible. I know. Which means you're missing something."" A pause. ""Or they're lying.""

""They're not lying.""

""How do you know?""

Because Maya had seen it in their eyes. The absolute conviction. The confusion underneath—the part of them that knew this was impossible but couldn't deny their own experience.

Because she'd felt that same confusion when the mountains inverted.

""I just do,"" Maya said.

Sarah sighed. ""Your mother called me. About Naomi.""

Maya's hand tightened on the phone. ""I'm not discussing this.""

""She's been admitted again. St. Catherine's. Same symptoms, worsening delusions—""

""I said I'm not discussing this."" Maya's voice came out harder than intended. ""Naomi is not my responsibility. I can't help her. I've tried.""

""Have you?"" Sarah asked quietly. ""Or have you been running from her for three years?""

The accusation hung in the air. Maya looked at her reflection in the dark window—thirty-four years old, dark hair pulled back severe, circles under her eyes. She looked like their mother. Like Naomi before the first break.

""I have to go,"" Maya said.

""Maya—""

She ended the call.

For a long moment, she stood in the silent room, watching Millbrook sleep. Then she opened her laptop again and pulled up the file she'd been avoiding: *Subject N. Reeves. Persistent Delusional Disorder.*

Her sister's case file.

Naomi had been seeing things for three years. Impossible things. Shadows that moved wrong. Voices in the static. And once, memorably, a door in their childhood home that had never existed, that Naomi insisted led somewhere important.

The doctors called it psychosis. Maya had agreed. Had to agree. Because the alternative—that Naomi actually saw something real—was unthinkable.

But now, in a town where two hundred people shared the same impossible experience, Maya felt the foundations of her certainty beginning to crack.

She closed the laptop. Took a sleeping pill. Lay down in the dark.

Just before sleep took her, she heard it: a child's voice, very soft, very close.

""Do you believe in me yet?""

Maya's eyes snapped open. The room was empty. Silent. Just the hum of the mini-fridge and the distant sound of traffic.

Just fatigue. Suggestion. Professional hazard.

She told herself that all night, through dreams of purple skies and mountains that breathed.

She told herself that, and almost believed it.

We're planning for 100 guests including our family. 
I'm the only girl with 4 brothers-good decent brothers- let me say-but it defaults to me to plan this-how much everything do I need? food, beverages, etc.  My sisters in law are helpful, but it's mostly on me to figure out quantities of everything. I've hosted lots of parties and family things, but it's been a while since I've planned for 100 (or more) people. 
It's a casual open house at a small venue we rented in her little town with a light lunch buffet from 1 to 4 pm. It's a very small town-lots of her guests will also be elderly-obviously-but also mixed ages. My guess is most people will have probably eaten something before they come, except our family-24-28 of us- who have a busy day before the party. It's the midwest-people eat lunch earlier here-and they call it dinner.😁
 Mom picked her menu. She requested: deli ham on buns and egg salad on buns-I'm doing both sandwiches open faced on either cocktail buns or medium-sized buns.  
There will also be: Pasta salad; fresh fruit; and of course cupcakes or cake; nuts and either Hershey kisses or M&Ms; coffee-Scandanavians are big coffee drinkers up here, doncha know? Lemonade and water. How much of all these things is enough? 
We will do ½ of the buns ham and ½ egg salad.
 Is 8 dozen cocktail (or small) buns cut in half for open faced sandwiches enough?
 So that would be 192 sandwiches. 96 of each. 
Is 3 gallons of pasta salad and 3 gallons of fresh fruit enough?
Did I figure these quantities correctly? Not enough? Too much? Any helpful input would be appreciated.
 We're making the egg salad, pasta salads, assembling the sandwiches and fresh fruit platters, etc. and doing all the food ourselves (except I'm ordering the cupcakes/cake and buns)

I guess I'm a bit of a coffee snob and one of my top priorities was to find an automatic espresso coffee machine that grinds the beans for each cup. I was successful in that but the struggle began to find coffee beans. I have not yet truly explored بالبذورية or I've been told بالشعلان. What I have done tho is the supermarkets at the malls. It looks like بن الشامي has a pretty strong presence at the malls. My first try was at Mall Qasiyon in their supermarket, where the have the beans in front you (really all of their stores, they have the beans displayed for you to choose). I requested a small amount of their two roasts. The guy proceeds to grind it for me. I say ""hey, wait! stop! I need the beans"" and they proceed to tell me that it's company policy not to sell beans. I was very confused and asked why and they told me that there's cameras watching them and even if they wanted to they can't and they'll lose their jobs. 

I thought that was so strange. Why can they sell the same stuff ground up but not as beans? Anyways I proceeded the next day to stop by كفرسوسة. There is one بن الشامي outside and one in Target. I had my husband try in both as I didn't want to be recognized as a foreigner and also didn't want to get upset 😅. Same thing. What are they adding to the beans when they grind them? What's the point of refusal to sell beans as a company? Why must their coffee be ground? 

Also has anyone else noticed that they get caffeine withdrawal when they order coffee from random cafes like the supposed chain cafes in Damascus? 

There's something weird going on with the coffee supply in Syria...

I do want to mention that I have found bags of beans in both grandmart and target, the brand is unopresso. It works but I want a medium roast and possibly beans that are a bit less acidic and more nutty. ",2,1761549678.0,Syria,0,1.0,False

Myself I mainly drink black coffee, Americans and lungos. No espresso. I do use coffee beans. 


But for my family and friends I would love to be able to whip up a decent or acceptable cappuccino or latte macchiato.

My budget is around 600 euros, max 650 if possible. 


What brands or models do you guys recommend. Because the options are countless and reviews often positive by ""normal"" people but expert reviews are than less positive. Any advice would be welcome. 


And last: it should he able to also pour hot water for tea, preferable not from the same hole as the coffee, my wife hates coffee with a passion and doesn't want any leftovers in her tea water.

1oh7vi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/1oh7vi6/behind_the_signs/,Behind the Signs,"Being on strike isn’t glamorous. From the outside, it’s easy to see the signs, the chants, the show of unity and assume it’s all fire and passion. But living it, day after day, is something else entirely. It’s exhaustion. It’s fear. It’s monotony. It’s standing in the cold with people you care about, all of you silently wondering how much longer you can keep doing it.

Every morning starts with the same ritual. Bundling up, checking the weather, grabbing a coffee that never stays warm long enough. Then you head out to walk the same stretch of sidewalk, holding the same sign, hoping for a different outcome. The wind cuts through your clothes, the hours crawl by, and the excitement that carried you through the first few days starts to fade. You start to feel like you’re just... waiting. Waiting for someone, somewhere, to make a decision that will finally let you get your life back.

The financial hit is brutal. There’s no way to sugarcoat it. When the paychecks stop, the stress starts to creep into every part of your life. You start living week to week, counting every dollar, trying to make impossible choices. Bills stack up. Groceries get thinner. The things that used to feel normal, grabbing dinner out, buying something small for yourself, suddenly feel like luxuries you can’t afford. Every conversation about money turns into a reminder of what you’ve lost, and it wears on you in ways that go far beyond your wallet.

Then there’s the social toll. People don’t talk about that enough. The constant tension, the awkward conversations, the looks from people who don’t quite know what to say. Even among those walking beside you, there’s an unspoken heaviness. You try to keep spirits up, but it’s hard to fake smiles when your feet are numb and your future feels uncertain. It changes the way you see people and the way they see you.

And just when you think you can’t feel any more drained, the thought of going back to work hits you like a wave. The dread of walking in after eight long weeks, facing a mountain of backlogged work, broken routines, and strained relationships. You know nothing will be the same right away, and you brace yourself for that uneasy silence that follows the end of a long fight.

But for many of us, the hardest part wasn’t the cold or the waiting, it was what happened at home. Having a partner who is excluded, who’s still working while you’re out there every day, adds another layer of pain. You try to be proud of each other, supportive of each other, but it’s hard. They go to work while you walk the line. They come home tired; you come home empty. Its love mixed with resentment; pride tangled up with guilt. It tests you in ways you never expected.

The managers we consider friends, you were deeply missed every day. The line between remaining silent and wanting to reach out often blurred, as we thought of you often. We recognized the burdens you were carrying and appreciated the quiet strength and support you continued to show us from afar

And yet,despite it all, we did it. We showed up. Every single day. Through the cold, through the uncertainty, through the exhaustion and doubt. We leaned on each other when we wanted to give up. We found strength in moments we didn’t know we had any left. And when it finally ended, we stood a little taller, not because it was easy, but because we made it through the hardest thing we’ve ever done.

To our friends, our partners, our family, thank you. Even if you weren’t part of the strike, your unwavering support meant more than words can express.

We made it through.

We fucking did it.

Stylish and functional things come together in your living room. Put down a neutral base, like soft cream walls, a comfy sofa, or a rough coffee table, and then add different colors and textures on top of it. You can give the room depth and personality by adding throw pillows, colorful pillows, and a large mirror. One of the best home decor stores, Trish Scully's fancy vintage mirrors and soft throw pillows can quickly enhance a room without taking over the design. You should combine old-world charm with more modern touches. One example of a stylish difference is a tufted armchair with a contemporary metal vase. Use gold or pearl-colored decorations that reflect light beautifully to keep the room bright and welcoming.

(Read if you’re interested in teeth stuff. Otherwise skip.)

1. Was in gymnastics, doing those crazy flips on a bar. I was 5 and trying to show off. (I had just grown my adult tooth). I ended up slamming my chompers terminal velocity into the bar mid-flip. Cut the darn nerve. Handicapped (slightly) myself for life.

2. I was 6, hanging out in a shopping cart. I stood up to point at some Oreos when my sibling shoved the cart and made me fall out of the cart, directly onto my head. I bit onto my tooth- or like- my bottom tooth pushed up on it really hard and it snapped again.

3. I was 6, just replaced my tooth. I was pretending the couch was eating my foot. I yanked my foot out really hard for some reason and proceeded to slam my face into the coffee table.

4. Was playing tag at the age of 9. I was running towards a pole and really had to consider which way to go tactically. Left or right of the pole. It was a big decision. I decided to run full speed into it, breaking the same tooth.

5. I thought of something amazing at 10 years old and ran across the kitchen to make my big entrance to tell everyone. I jumped on a barstool, said “Hey guys-!” Then learned about how velocity works when the barstool promptly decided to throw me through the wall. My tooth didn’t make it, and neither did the wall.

6. I was 12, in class, bored, chewing on a zipper. It was all normal until my tooth popped off randomly and I interrupted class with a proper cacophony as my nerve was exposed once more.

7. Was playing some statues of the park remix at 15. It was midnight, so we couldn’t see. I fell into a 5 foot ditch and bit dirt. Luckily it only chipped the fake bit, so it didn’t hurt as much as the other times.

(Three bonus almost bone related things)

1. I ripped my leg open so deep that the bone was visible. Now I have a hole in my leg that you can stick your finger in and feel the bone. Fun stuff, it doesn’t even hurt. It’s just a cool thing I do to freak people out.

2. I moved my cuticle down half an inch on my big toe. So now my toenail grows in as- the only way I can describe it- slightly pixelated. Like- squares and bumpy. (It holds nail polish wonderfully. Can’t even sand the stuff off.)

3. Went to get my Wisdom teeth removed and discovered I actually had 5. Very interesting, I didn’t even know you could have more than 4 before that. Also, two of my molars are severely misshapen. It looks like I have 6 canines despite only having 4.

I kinda enjoy making espresso, the routine, dialing in, all that. But my wife never makes coffee because it’s too much of a hassle for her, and I have to admit, the idea of pressing one button and getting a good cup sounds really nice sometimes. Plus, we went to that hotel that had a nice auto machine, and while the espresso was meh, I liked how easy it was (and the self cleaning is pretty neat), I think it was De’Longhi Magnifica something, but not sure.

I know the main tradeoff with a fully automatic machine is quality. people say the espresso just isn’t as good. But how noticeable is it really in day to day life? Like, is it something that would actually bother someone used to a decent manual setup?

Sometimes I’m getting a bad coffee myself, sometimes it’s from channeling, sometimes other stuff, so it’s not like I’m Mr. barista or something, plus I’m not entirely on schedule when it comes to maintenance (backflushing and all the recommended cleanings).

Also, there are a million automatic machines out there, and if I go to a store to try one, the coffee might suck because they’re using old beans or have it set up wrong, so it’s hard to judge.

What do you think? should I stick with my Profitec Go and embrace the ritual, or move to an automatic for the convenience (and maybe keep my grinder for other stuff)?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s made that switch one way or the other.",1,1761548646.0,superautomatic,6,1.0,False
1oh7r36,https://i.redd.it/c6qq9mpcslxf1.jpeg,Grind size for chemex?,"Hi everyone, I recently got a chemex and the DF54 (want to also get an espresso machine in the future, hence my choice for this grinder). 

Yesterday I attempted my first brew with a light roast. It was drinkable but I suspect it was definitely underextracted. I enjoy acidity but even then it was too sour, especially given that the coffee is supposed to have notes of chocolate, almonds and toffee. 

Because of some comments on reddit, I started with grind size 90 and 93 degrees celsius. However, is it possible that a light roast calls for a finer grind and hotter water temp? I’m very new to this. 

Then something else: my boyfriend bought cheap, very dark roast robusta because we were instructed to grind 45 g of coffee on setting 50 before usage & we didn’t want to waste our good beans. Will I need to clean the grinder every time he’s used the it for these beans? 

Thank you so much 🙏🏻🙏🏻 ",1,1761548586.0,DF54,2,1.0,False

Not the big routines, just the little stuff that’s easy to forget. Stretching for a bit before sleep, rolling the shoulders when they feel tight. Drinking water before that next coffee instead of after. Stuff like that doesn’t seem like much, but it really changes how the body feels day to day.

Even quick recovery moments can make a difference. A short massage after working out helps muscles chill faster. Some heat before bed loosens everything up and makes it easier to rest. Taking a few deep breaths when work gets heavy, that helps too. None of it’s fancy, it just works if it’s done often enough.

Recovery doesn’t need to be perfect or complicated. It’s just paying attention and doing the small things that keep the body moving and the mind calm. Those tiny habits pile up in a good way.",1,1761548521.0,RENPHOLife,0,1.0,False

I've broken the concept down into two feature modes—Solo Pilot and Group Rally—that integrate real-time data to solve common traveler pain points. Let me know what you think!""

Feature Proposal 1: Solo Pilot (Personalized Trip Safety & Discovery)

This feature enhances individual road trips by integrating real-time environmental data with intelligent pacing suggestions, improving safety and spontaneous discovery.

Feature Name : Solo Pilot - Dynamic Route Planning

The User Problem

Current navigation is purely time/distance-based. Solo travelers lack proactive safety warnings (weather) and intelligent assistance for making comfortable rest stops and spontaneous detours.

Target User

Solo travelers, road trippers, and long-distance drivers focused on efficiency, safety, and comfort.

Core Functionality

1. Weather-Aware Navigation | Integrates real-time, hyperlocal weather data directly into the route. If rain, snow, or high wind is detected on the route ahead, a proactive warning is issued, and an Alternate Weather Route option is suggested to avoid the severe zone.

2. Dynamic POI Pacing | Allows the user to set a pacing preference (e.g., ""Stop every 3 hours"" or ""Lunch between 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM""). The map dynamically highlights high-rated restaurants and rest stops that fall within that specific time/distance window along the route.

3. On-Route Discovery Feed | A subtle, swipe-up feature in the navigation view that surfaces highly-rated POIs (scenic views, landmarks, unique coffee shops) that require a minimal, 5-minute maximum detour from the current route.

Key Metric Impact

Increase user engagement for long trips, improve route completion satisfaction, and enhance overall driver safety.


Feature Proposal 2: Group Rally (Collaborative Group Trip Logistics)

This feature unifies disparate location-sharing and route-planning tools into a seamless, automated hub for managing complex group trips involving multiple cars/bikes starting from different locations.

Feature Name : Group Rally - Automated Group Trip Coordination

The User Problem

Coordinating multi-car/bike trips is highly manual: group members have to share their location/ETA individually, and there is no simple way to track everyone's progress, especially at the start and end of a trip.

Target User

Friends, families, or clubs traveling together in separate vehicles.

Core Functionality

1. Group Rally Dashboard

A single, shareable ""Trip Plan"" hub where the organizer defines the Rally Point (main trip start), Final Destination, and invites members. All shared plans and locations are centralized here.

2. Automated Staging

On the day of the trip, the system automatically calculates and tracks each invited member's individual route/ETA from their current location (home) to the central Rally Point, pending their permission.

3. Live Rally-View & Alerts

During the main journey, all group cars are shown on the map. The system actively monitors group cohesion and issues a ""Rally Alert"" to the lead car if a trailing car's ETA diverges significantly, allowing for immediate group check-in or regrouping.

4. ""Home Stretch"" Monitoring

Once the Final Destination is reached, location sharing automatically shifts to monitoring the individual route from the destination to each member's pre-set home address, ending the sharing automatically upon arrival for a simple group safety check.

Key Metric Impact

Increase use of Google Maps for pre-trip planning, drive adoption of continuous location sharing for coordination, and eliminate third-party communication for group logistics.

""In short, the Journey Hub aims to end the annoying coordination texts and give solo travelers better peace of mind. Hopefully, this idea makes its way to the Maps team. Thanks for reading and for your feedback!""",2,1761548295.0,GoogleMaps,0,1.0,False

We haven’t yet stolen sideways glances or shared wine, but the words we share in silence hold that same deep intimacy, even as we reach across distance. You are everywhere, softening the dark corners under my ribs, a warmth that gently seeps through the coldest hours.

I won’t lie and say it’s been easy, because it hasn’t. Between misunderstandings, wounds, and ache, we have hurt each other, whether intended or not, it happened and I’m sorry for every moment I made it harder to breathe, for every word that missed its mark or fell heavy in the space between us. I’m sorry for every misunderstanding that widened the distance, for the ache I added to your own. I know neither of us can rewind that and I need you to know; my heart has never been careless with you. In fact, my caution at times was the culprit; the truth is, I was scared to lose you in this lifetime too and scared for us to carry the ache of absence again.

Even through the distance and trials we have faced, my love, I still choose you, not in some fever-dream of perfection, but in the true, honest way two hearts return again and build home. If you ever wondered whether anyone would truly choose you, knowing the weight of the ache, the answer is yes, darling. I choose you, over and over, in every uncertain hour, in every vision of tomorrow.

I walk with you in the quiet corridors of my mind, sharing laughter I imagine between us over coffee, the way your eyes might crease when you’re tired, the comfort of leaning shoulder to shoulder, saying nothing, just letting the world be gentler together for a while.

I ache to learn the language of your hand in mine, sharing laughter, tears, and quiet, but even now, you are here, carried gently in my longing, a warmth I refuse to give up, the one I my heart chooses again and again, even in the dark.

I hope you find this and I hope to one day share these words with you in a more personal way. Know that somewhere, someone carries the memory of you before memory, choosing you gently, again and again. I wait for you in the in-between, hand and heart extended, hoping we can stay in the dance together, side by side.

Always yours,

Most days, I’m somewhere between a caffeine high and a financial model. My mornings start before sunrise — gym, black coffee, and questionable life choices — and my nights end with either a good podcast or me trying to convince myself that scrolling LinkedIn counts as self-improvement.

I’ll text you good morning, send a meme five minutes later, and then act chill while secretly overanalyzing your “haha.” I’m that kind of balance — part chaos, part charm, full effort.

I can cook a mean breakfast, burn dinner impressively, and still make you laugh in between. I like people who can hold a conversation that goes from stupidly funny to strangely deep without warning.

I will keep this story short, but for context we matched on the app chatted for about a week went on a first date. Date went great, The next weekend we go on a dinner date and we end up sleeping together. And we’ve been seeing each other since. She is truly a wonderful person. Now the problem I am having a hard time with is the way she speaks sometimes about her past. We’ve discussed past relationships a few times, she practically never asked me about details (which is kinds weird not gonna lie) but me being me im a little more nosey and i tend to ask a lot of questions. Shes told me shes been with 4 other guys. If you include me that makes it 5 total. Granted thats not a lot but still wouldn’t say it’s nothing. 1 dude in highschool and 2 guys in college. She was with a guy for about 2-3 years on and off during college. Now all of those are whatever, i get it. The one that is really annoying me and i cant seem to get the thing out of my head is the most recent one. Which was about 5-6 months ago. She met this person on the same dating app, and she slept with him on the first date (it was a coffee date mind you). When she told me this she almost bragged about it telling me she fucked him in his tesla car. Honestly when she told me this i vividly remember the anger i felt. Because i never asked where and how it happened (why would you tell me this).  And the manner she told me this, as if it was something she was proud off really put me off. She was seeing this person for about 6-8 months but he told her he didn’t want a relationship so she ended things. Fast forward a few months shes back on the app and meets me. In conversations shes also said things along the lines of “im happy things didn’t get physical between us too fast” you know comparing me to the last situationship she was in. In another conversation we one time were discussing best spots to have sex in and she says a car (the worst spot if you ask me). But all of this stuff keeps adding up. Long story short, i cant but feel like i was some sort of back up plan. She sleeps with guy on a first date (a coffee date), brags about it to me that it was in a tesla (this image wont leave my head). Overall I just feel like i got the shortend of the stick here, that this person is just looking for anything at this point, maybe is a little easy to get with and at this point it just so happened that she found me along the road. For context when she did brag about how she fucked this dude in his car I told her how irritating that was to hear from her. She agreed and eventually apologized. But nonetheless these feelings and images haven’t left me and im not sure how to approach this situation in my head. I know its easy to say ohh it just the past or whatever but again its not just about that. I didn’t really care about the other guys she was with, just this person.

1oh7dwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1oh7dwx/dreaming_right_now_as_we_speak/,"Dreaming right now, as we speak!!","I thought it would be pretty neat to come on here to tell people about the dream I am currently in the midst of having. It's quite strange, although it's not a world apart from my own life, and I guess, in fact, it *is* my own life. 

The story goes that, well, recently and over the last week or so, I've been not drinking coffee after eight pm or so. Before that I would be drinking that drink up until I went to bed at night, and wondering why I wasn't getting very good sleep. But now, however, I'm having some wicked sleep, and whereas before when I would wake up in the morning I would feel a certain sort of psychotropic effect (thanks to antipsychotics running through my blood) in my head a brains, I now do not feel as quote unquote ""wankered"", and I wake up now feeling like a normal person (quote unquote). 

Well, in any case, the idea was to come on here and tell people here - the dreamers and the lucid dreamers alike - that I am *currently asleep and in the process of having a dream.* I don't know how far I can take this idea. But I will say that this dream is a lot like the life I live on a day to day basis. However, I digress. 

Tonight I've been having some *wicked* lucid dreams, I can't tell you. I'll just set some of the content out here for those still with me. 

I dreamed that I was inside my apartment and I heard music in my head, and various voices, but the music was the most beautiful heavy music I've ever heard, like the music of Torche, who're like this heavier metal Smashing Pumpkins, and there I was dreaming this music. And several things happened, such as one of my cats turned into a spider and began scuttling about the house - pretty darn scary and freaky, but then *everything* became arachnid-like, such as the trees outside my room. 

And I only saw the trees outside my room because there was a great **crack** of like thunder, although it was the walls and windows of my room being smashed in, and it transcribed that there was a gaping hole in the door in my room, and when I went outside to check what happened there were some eight or nine ""roadmen"" like, if you can imagine, British teenage gangsters dressed in black, and they did it, or they had smashed the hole in my house wall, and I went out. And when I spoke to them I wasn't afraid, and I said, ""Guys, why did you do this, man? What's the problem?"" and they fell silent and one or two of them were smoking, I assume crack. But when I said that, they all ran away. 

But before my cat became a spider or a spider-like arachnid (she's ginger and grey), I remember I was calmly sat there talking to three people out of The Big Bang Theory you know, that physics show, and I was playing snooker or pool with Rajesh Kuthrapali and Leonard and Penny were also there, and one thing led to another, although I don't remember who won the game, but now I come to think of it, I remember one or two of the pool shots, that were some kind of trick shots, but now I come to think of it, I forget that part - maybe it was the start of the dream, I don't know. But Rajesh and me were sitting on the sofa, and I said to him, ""Dude, you have to realise something!"" and he said, ""How??"" and I said, ""Just imagine you were having a revelation about physics and maths!"" and he said, ""Ohh, yeah, I see,"" or some such thing, and then I said, ""Now take away the physics part!"" and then he realised he was gay, and in any case, we started making out, me & Raj, and I got his knob out, but he couldn't come. And now I come to think of it, it wasn't Penny but that other female, the one that was married to Howard in the show, you know, what's her name? Anyway, Raj needed a female touch, you all know the feeling! 

But when I went out into the garden area at my estate, after these gangsters ran away, I went and sat with some adults on a patch of grass at the back of the area. There were probably ten or fifteen of us, men and women. So I wound up sitting with a lovely lady in my arms, and I was cradling her. Then the next second some other guy approaches this woman in my arms, and he starts making out with her, and I said, ""That's fine,"" and actually it was. 

I realise this might be quite boring, actually. But it wasn't at the time. 

But the dream went on, and I will tell you more. I went back to my apartment and began watching a Steve Martin movie, and it was pretty fuckin hilarious, and the name of it turned out to be ""Me & You in the Meanwhile"" or some such thing, a bit like ""Me, Myself and Irene"", and I vowed to look up the movie once I woke up, but I just did, and it doesn't exist, or in any case, I knew it wouldn't. 

But then I was reading the bible, and all this crazy stuff was going on in my apartment, doors banging, people knocking, and at one stage I looked out of the window, and Steve Coogan the actor had come to visit. The purpose of it was to let me know that the universities were recruiting. In any case, I took a bus ride around the area of Mill Hill, London, and saw that universities *were indeed* recruiting, and that I might see about taking an acting degree, or something like that. 

And I had my head in the bible, and it was the only thing that could get the world to calm down, because for some reason, the world was might angry with me, and were breaking at my doors and trying to smash in and get in, and all that. And when I went outside, I saw the trees and bushes and shrubbery, clear as day, and saw them and every tiny leaf in full green colour, and I thought 'This is stunning, clearer than in real life,' so I must've known I was dreaming. 

Anyway, last thing. The world was going mad, I was having messianic thoughts, and my childhood best friend Scott, well, he turned up, but he was a psychiatric nurse, and he came in. And he gave me a shot of injected antipsychotic meds, in my backside, and anyway, it was more interesting than that. 

In any case, the takeaways were, that when I saw the shrubbery and bushes and trees, every individual green leaf was as clear and visible as the pure day, clearer than real life, and I knew I was dreaming. 

But the point is, that I have just now finished that part of the dream, and I woke up out of it, although it might as well have been into another dream, and I might as well be dreaming now, and in a way I am. 

And soon, although it's time to wake up, I'm gonna go back to ""sleep"" and enter into that other world, where I might black out, or I might continue to dream, or who knows what can happen? 

I was going to say something then, but it's gone. ",1,1761547106.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

We never saw Aziraphale reacting to Beelzebub in Season 2, facing what he saw they and Hell did (or would have done) to Crowley. But we did see Crowley reacting to Gabriel, processing those emotions.

That’s probably another reason why people side with the dark husband in this thought, though divorce. (Just for the matter, I don’t agree; I think Aziraphale reacted logically and safely).

What would have happened, though? Would he have forgotten Beelzebub if it were they knocking at his door? Would we had seen an emotional scene  as the Crowley and Gabriel/Jim confrontation? Or do you think we already did see that, as to say, when he reacted to Gabriel, since he must be quite aware of what happened?

I answered yes to all those questions myself, since I asked them first—but you can add more.

It makes me uncomfortable especially since I have a girlfriend, who’s met Hannah and found it weird too. I finally told Hannah to stop calling me that, that it’s not appropriate. She got defensive and said I clearly can’t take a joke and that I embarrassed her. Now a few coworkers think I overreacted.

1oh7cqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1oh7cqh/28_f4m_philippinesanywhere_i_want_to_be_in_a/,"28 [F4M] Philippines/Anywhere - I want to be in a long-term, healthy relationship","**I want to grow old with him, my fiancé and my later husband, in a thousand lifetimes, in a thousand splendid universes. I pray that this love may come into my life as an honorable guest.**

**I want to have long-term voice calls.** 

If I get married, I want to just keep a life around some things like sadaqah (not only money, but time, care, attention), maintaining the same routine, and looking after each other until we grow old together and our hair is grey and our bodies are not so young anymore. I want something small and quiet, not built on grand plans or perfection, but on a slow, steady kind of love that doesn’t demand to be noticed. I don’t want a grand life. I just want a quiet one. I want a life that doesn’t rush, that doesn’t try to outshine anyone. I want to live close to stillness, where peace feels like air, and the days pass in a way that doesn’t call for attention. I don’t want a marriage that looks impressive. I want one that feels like home.

I’ve never wanted much. A home that smells of prayer. A man who is kind. Someone whose silence I can share without feeling unseen. A life built on small habits: giving sadaqah, saying sorry, preparing tea or coffee for one another, saying a prayer before calling it a day. I think love lives best inside small things. Something that doesn’t hurry. Something that doesn’t change even when everything else does.

I want a life where we give sadaqah together, quietly, without telling anyone. A life where faith is not talked about excessively but lived, little by little, in how we speak, how we forgive, how we take care of each other. I want to wake up every day knowing that the person beside me still tries, still stays, still forgives. We won’t demand perfection. We’ll build safety. In the monotony of our days, we’ll find the infinite. I don’t want fireworks every day. But monotony doesn’t mean boredom. Because with him, each day will differ. We’ll laugh and cry when the world insists on sorrow and memories. We’ll be confident because we have each other.

If I get married, I want to love my fiancé, and later my husband, with the same breath and depth of a love that never errs in pardoning. I think about forgiveness a lot. How it’s never really about who’s right. It’s about who’s willing to keep the peace. I want to forgive before I’m asked to. I want to say sorry even when I think I shouldn’t have to. Not because I’m weak, but because I’d rather lose a small argument than lose the warmth between us. Maybe love is just a thousand quiet pardons. The kind you give without saying anything. The kind that shows up as a hand reaching out again. A meal cooked after an argument. A smile that says, it’s fine, I still love you. I want to build a life where forgiveness is not dramatic: it’s simply what we do.

I don’t want a big house. I don’t want to chase after fleeting or temporary things because all that glitters is not gold. I just want a space that feels lived in, warm, clean, peaceful. Maybe a little messy, but real. I want a house where the Qur’an is always open somewhere, and we both know where it is. A house where there’s tea or coffee in the morning, prayer in the days and evenings, and laughter that sounds like ease.

When our hair is grey and our hands our trembling, I’m safe at the thought that he’ll still bring me water when my voice is hoarse. I want the kind of life that doesn’t look like much from the outside but feels like heaven on the inside. I want to keep forgiving, and I want to keep being forgiven. That’s how I want to grow old: with mercy in the center of everything. If I get married, I want to live a life that is small, simple but sincere.

And if, for the both of us, life begins again in the afterlife, and time returns a thousand times over, I would still love him: the same way, in every lifetime.",1,1761546968.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Sometimes we assume that ministry only happens inside the walls of a church. That people have to come to us, at the time we’ve decided, on the terms we’ve set, in the building we’ve labeled sacred. But God has never been confined to buildings. He moves where people are, and He calls us to do the same.  
  
Peter had to leave the comfort of Joppa and walk into Cornelius’ home. It wasn’t just a change of scenery; it was a shift of mindset. Peter didn’t wait for Cornelius to come to him. He obeyed God and stepped into someone else’s space. That one decision opened the door for an entire household to encounter God. But it never would have happened if Peter had stayed where it was familiar.  
  
We have to ask ourselves a hard question. Are we only comfortable ministering to people who come to us? Do we only love those who look, act, or believe like us? Are we more committed to church services than to serving people? Because if that’s the case, we’re missing the point.  
  
To truly follow Jesus, you have to go where He goes. And more often than not, He’s out among the hurting, the overlooked, the messy, and the broken. That means leaving your comfort zone. It means showing up in places that stretch you, talking to people who challenge you, and loving people who are different from you. It means having conversations before conversions, listening before correcting, and seeing people as image-bearers before seeing them as projects.  
  
Jesus is not impressed with how well we can host a service. He is looking for people who will carry His heart into the world. And the world is not waiting inside a church building. It’s at your job, in your neighborhood, in the coffee shop, on social media, and in every place you go.  
  
Peter could have missed that moment. So can we. But if we’re willing to go where God leads and love the people He puts in front of us, He will do what only He can do. The question is, are you willing to leave your comfort zone? Because that’s where the real ministry begins. DLC

I met and knew most of the local police since we gave them free coffee which in turn kept them coming and going. That was really nice too especially at night as the store had been robbed at gunpoint a number of times. In any event-one evening one of the local patrolmen came in all big eyed and overly excited. He said they just found a body in a bathtub at a nearby motel. The tub was filled with milk!

Current roommate is a male medical professional in mid 30s.

Rent: $3000 / mo, utilities not included (usually $250/mo)

Room has own bathroom across the hall. Living room furnished with 2 couches, coffee table, and bar. Balcony has grass-carpet to sit / stand on and bench (great to bring guests). Can keep bedroom furniture there or get rid of (up to you).

Building has a doorman, in-unit laundry, and a gym.  
Price is also rent-stabilized since the original roommate obtained it during COVID, so it is much cheaper than its current going price (see their website listing TF Cornerstone).

Please message me if interested in the property.

I can't go on long walks or anything really outdoorsy anymore, which I used to find to be the best option for dates.

Even the thought of walking to sit down and have a ""coffee"" with someone seems to be a bit much and gets me tachy (would have to be something else because I don't even drink caffeine anymore lol). I have decent success on apps but I never really get to the meet up stage anymore (this is my fault) because of my fears with this. I feel very ashamed of my condition and have no idea what to actually do for the dates without it being weird.
