and also today i had a bagel and a donut from Tim Horton's (a coffee shop in canada that's super popular) and my parents also had donuts and now im terrified of food poisoning too. i don't usually eat from the same places my family eats at together but i wasn't thinking and ate my donut and bagel too. im supposed to be getting my period tomorrow and im having cramps and i am just rambling really bad right now!!!!!!! i just feel so out of control and scared and want to crawl out of my skin. today was a really hard day too because my boyfriend was MIA and freaked everybody out because no one had seen him for close to two days but he's okay now! so it's been a rollercoaster of a day. i just really wish i didn't eat my bagel and donut but i know i can't change that. if anybody has any kind words or advice, i would it appreciate smüòî thank u 4 reading thisüíóüíóüíó",1,1739851743.0,emetophobiarecovery,1,1.0,False

1is3ywy,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1is3ywy/ive_been_such_a_fool/,I've been such a fool,"I met the love of my life in September. I've had multiple relationships before her, some that spanned as long as 7 years. But I never fell for anyone as hard as I did for her. I proposed to her two months into dating. We were discussing wedding plans, our honeymoon, moving in with one another immediately after I gave her the ring. 

She has a problem with alcohol. She went to rehab in December. I supported her every step of the way. I housed her cat while she was gone. I called her every night so she wouldn't be alone, and for me, too. 

Rehab wasn't going so good for her. Once she detoxed, the courses and therapy they had her do gave her a lot of anxiety and it was actually making her worse off than when she was drinking. In ways. 

I made a 12 hour round trip to pick her up from rehab. She cheated on me about 5 days later. 

It hurt so much. It felt like someone had just snatched my heart from my chest, and it was instead the hollowness left behind that was beating. She confessed to it the night after she did it. Wracked with guilt. She promised she wouldn't talk to him, that doing this brought her ""closure"". I forgave her because I just hadn't felt a love like this. 

I didn't learn this until the day before my birthday, but she cheated on me again days after that. When I learned, she tried to defend it as ""only oral"". She also asked if we could make our relationship into a poly relationship with the guy she cheated on me with. Despite knowing how much I was hurting over it, let alone the fact we had discussed monogomy on our first dates. 

I learned she also cheated on me a third time. When she did it, she had woken me up at 3am, full of energy. She was at my place, and said she was going for a walk. It was the beginning of January... I told her I wasn't going to let her go out in the cold, so I got her an Uber home. She cheated on me again, and I paid for her transport there like an idiot. 

I learned the latter two instances about two weeks ago. And since then we've been in a limbo phase of trying to work it out. I didn't forgive her this time, which to me is huge but writing it out feels small. She promised me she wouldn't see him in person again. 

Last Tuesday, we had plans to meet for coffee. I checked in two hours before to see if we were still on. She told me she was on a road trip with Denys, lifelong best friend. I was upset for being ditched, but moved on. But the whole day I was paranoid if she was with Denys, or with the guy she cheated on me with. 

Tonight she confessed she was actually on the road trip with him, ""as friends"". They went to see a farm that, when they were dating, he had told her he wanted them to move to. 

So it's over. I might not have much respect for myself but I do have limits. I left her place just an hour ago and I'm spiralling. She wasn't accepting of the break up. She tried to gaslight me by saying there was no promise, and that she didn't break any promises. She's gone back and forth from crying to berating me. At this point she's asleep and I'm just rehashing this all. I have no idea what tomorrow will bring. She was such a large part of my life, maybe for a short while but I quickly came to think of her as home, and now... It's gone. Everything between us, gone. I think I did more than was expected by forgiving her, trying to rebuild trust, trying to set and respect boundaries... And so far she hasn't even acknowledged she's done anything wrong for this road trip. This sucks. I want my partner back, the one that I could trust and who showed me what a happy life felt like.

1is3yg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelTrotters/comments/1is3yg2/exploring_unesco_world_heritage_sites_a_cultural/,Exploring UNESCO World Heritage Sites: A Cultural Voyage,"Hey fellow travel enthusiasts! üåç I've just ticked off my 50th country, and my heart is brimming with tales from around the world that I can't wait to share with you all. If you're like me, perpetually bitten by the travel bug and curious about cultural wonders, then you're in for a treat!

Let's dive right into the world of UNESCO World Heritage Sites - those iconic places that capture the essence of a nation's history, culture, and artistic achievement. These sites aren't just Instagram-worthy spots; they're gateways to understanding the diverse tapestries that weave our global community together. So grab a coffee (or tea), get comfy, and let's embark on this cultural voyage together!

üèõÔ∏è **Rich History at Every Corner: The Acropolis in Athens, Greece**

Walking up the steps of the Acropolis, you're treading the same paths where ancient philosophers once theorized. It‚Äôs a surreal experience that ignites the imagination - here, history speaks to you from every stone and pillar. Tip: Visit early in the morning or just before sunset to skip the crowds and relish the views in a tranquil setting.

üçÉ **Natural Beauty Meets Myth: Machu Picchu in Peru**

Nestled high in the Andes, Machu Picchu isn't just an archaeological gem; it's a testament to the Inca‚Äôs harmonious relationship with nature. Hiking the Inca Trail not only brings you to the cusp of this mystical city but also allows you to experience the stunning biodiversity of Peru. Pro tip: Book your tickets months in advance as the site has limited daily visitors to preserve its beauty!

üïå **Architecture that Transcends Time: Taj Mahal in India**

The iridescent marble mausoleum has been capturing hearts for centuries. A symbol of eternal love, the Taj Mahal stands as a marvel of Mughal architecture, combining elements from Islamic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish, and Indian architectural styles. Don‚Äôt forget to visit the museum in the complex to learn more about the unique artifacts and history connected to this masterpiece.

Each UNESCO site offers a unique story - a piece of the global puzzle. And this is just the beginning of our journey! By exploring these sites, we not only enrich our own understanding but also contribute to preserving these treasures for future generations.

1is3xr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/furry/comments/1is3xr8/any_funnyclever_furryrelated_name_recommendations/,Any funny/clever furry-related name recommendations for a coffee or boba tea drink? (Explanation for why in body),"So I have a friend who I'm excited to say is going to be getting into the food and drink business, starting with a little place with a simple menu that primarily consists of coffees and boba teas and other related drinks. They can't wait to start this and we've had a blast going back and forth on cute and catchy names for individual drinks so they can stand out (I also showed them the Fizzy Fox's page and their menu since it was well-known in the fandom and it gave them inspiration).

But that being said, I had the brilliant idea come to mind to make one drink that would somehow have a name that was furry-related or would at least be a reference that someone who was a furry would catch even if others didn't. So I'd love to know if any of you would have any neat ideas for one that'd be funny or had some kind of clever name that any potential furry customers that came in would get.",1,1739851569.0,furry,0,1.0,False
1is3xnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/paint/comments/1is3xnc/how_would_you_approach_a_shaker_doordrawer/,How would you approach a shaker door/drawer cabinet job like this where all the caulking on the floating panels has cracked?,"You have a standard shaker door and drawer setup, although the previous painter caulked in all the floating panels. This is something I refrain from doing because in a few years they begin to crack. Well this customers shaker doors and drawers have cracked all along the seam from where they were previously caulked. She just wants the doors and drawers ""fixed"" and repainted to match the cabinet boxes

I have done dozens and dozens of cabinet jobs in my career but this is actually the first time I have ever had to repaint cabinets someone had previously caulked, and spray ONLY the doors and drawers. So I matched the Color and Sheen to the best of my ability, Gemini EVO Eclipse in color: KM's Swiss Coffee in Dull sheen.  
  
Since this is new to me, as well as the customer, we decided to start with her bathroom vanity and see how that turned out before moving along to the rest of the kitchen and other areas. Now the term ""Fixed"" was left to my discretion. I could either dig out the old caulking, sand, and then respray so it looks like it had never been caulked at all. I originally thought this would be the best way to go because the customer was worried about the caulk cracking again in the future. I also talked to my Paint Rep at Vista Paints and she recommended that if I were to re-caulk then I should use this ""Modified Silicone Acrylic"" - called ""Accelerator"". Apparently you need to spray immediately after applying the caulk or within 30 mins, Reduces paint film cracking, Will not discolor paint, Exceeds ASTM C-834. 50 Year guarantee. Etc. Etc.

[https://photos.app.goo.gl/A7WDSm8cC8nFuGss5](https://photos.app.goo.gl/A7WDSm8cC8nFuGss5) This stuff.  
  
So my original plan was to dig out old caulking, sand, then apply the ""Accelerator"" caulking, then spray right away. But once again, the customer would have caulked floating panel cabinet doors and faces again, that could possibly crack in the future again. 

As I was digging out the old caulking and sanding it actually didn't look too bad. So I decided to spray my first two coats without using the caulking and see how well it turns out. If it turns out poorly then I could always use the caulking and then respray the 4 doors, and 3 drawer faces (A lot more room to experiment here with only a few doors and drawers.)  
  
How would you other cabinet refinishers out there handle a situation like this? Just simply recaulk and respray or if you could, cleanly remove old caulking and then respray? I took some photo's but the light wasn't very good at this time of night.

Here is what I have after two coats on the doors, drawer faces will be be tomorrow since I couldn't hang them to spray in this situation.  
  
Here is an album of what I've got so far, think I could get away with applying another coat or so and not caulking, or should I re-caulk with the ""Accelerator"" stuff? [https://photos.app.goo.gl/GdHYHmn2GVFBgNkQ6](https://photos.app.goo.gl/GdHYHmn2GVFBgNkQ6)

What do others do in this sort of situation? 90% of my cabinet painting is refinishing old golden oak cabinets, but every now and then I run into something unique like this (and something awesome where I don't have to use grain filler).

So all thoughts and insights are welcome, let me know what you would do in this situation. All genuine comments are appreciated.",1,1739851559.0,paint,0,1.0,False

1is3v7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeddingPhotography/comments/1is3v7d/after_10_years_of_doing_weddings_i_might_call_it/,"After 10 years of doing weddings, I might call it quits...","Something I've been thinking about long and hard for the past few months, inquiries have been super slow, and it seems the money put into SEO / advertising never really got anywhere. 

I've got 14 weddings this year and I know that around April/May tends to be the cut off for knowing what your max amount will be, and so far, no 2026's booked. So here's why I'm considering quitting. 

1. **The Cost Of Living is no longer obtainable / easy being self employed:** Back in 2014 when I started, and up to 2021 I was making about $62,500 a year doing weddings and living quite comfortably, and often times between taxes I'd have about $15-20,000 in the bank to lessen the blow of taxes. My rent was affordable, my taxes were affordable, I had no debt whatsoever. 

However, within the last 4 years things really started skyrocketing to a point where no matter how many weddings I did, I always felt like I was coming up short, and my business expenses were pretty minimal, no new gear, minor hard drive purchases, that was it. Plus, the poverty line has been increasingly steadily to a point where if you're moved into a tax bracket, you pay full insurance, versus getting a tax credit. 

**2. Competition is all around us:** I can't knock other people for wanting to be self employed, it's perhaps one of the most liberating feelings on the planet, and nothing short of amazing to wake up and plan the day as you want, or edit as long as you want -- or even take a trip if you'd like. However, with competition, and the access to social media it really starts to change the landscape or advertising -- now I don't claim to be anti-technology, but I know that my personality does not jive with reels/TikToks -- i believe in honest work, posting consistently on Instagram, blogging and Facebook engagements. 

I've completely stopped looking at trying to outdo other photographers and gone back to doing this just for me, being able to create, not to rub it in anyone's face anymore. The race for likes, features is cool when you're starting out but gets tiring after so many years, if that's all you think about. And it's okay if every wedding is not bloggable or even 6 images worthy of a collage on Instagram.

**3. Long hours, glorifying exhaustion:** I get it, you take on what you want to take on, but when you're spending nearly 50-60 hours a week editing (multiple sessions) and often into later hours into the night/morning -- it gets exhausting. Part of me likes to wake up, have coffee, check emails and deliver galleries, go to the gym -- but I know that when I come home, I have to edit for about 6-8 hours and often not being able to push out a gallery until many days later, despite breezing through Lightroom.

Travel is fun, going to new places is amazing -- meeting new people, checking out new coffee shops -- but also, so much time spent on the road in between travel to where it makes more sense to take 2 days of rest before getting back to your home base. I've found myself taking about 2 days to drive either halfway or 3/4th's the way, rest up and finish the drive -- all the while keeping my clients in mind to post right away, as I want to share and they're waiting to see a recap.

**4. A thankless job and often going without recognition:** Very so often so I have great weddings where the couples give me a shout out, there's applause, and people are high fiving you on the way out after a really kick ass day. Most wedding days can be somewhat high strung, depending if there's vendor interference, either someone stepping on toes or trying to move the day in an entirely different direction. And you're someone who tries to capture it in all it's honesty, every little detail and provides a gentle push to get them out for sunset -- and all the while when the photos are reposted/shared, no credit. 

**5. Wondering if you're really making a difference:** With any line of work, we all have moments when we question why we do this, and what's the real end result. I've been fortunate to have repeat business from referrals and friends of friends. Perhaps after 10 years I've made the statement I've wanted to make and have left some imprint on the wedding world, but going forward, what's it all about? I find myself becoming more humble and less of trying to become a household name that I may have when I started out.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\

By *Walter O‚ÄôShea, Chronicler of the Absurd*

London and New York, Feb 7, 2025 ‚Äì If you think gold is just another shiny rock for rich people to hoard, you‚Äôre either na√Øve, stupid, or both. In an era where global finance has devolved into a high-stakes poker game run by ex-spooks, crooked bankers, and the kind of people who wear Rolexes but can‚Äôt tell time, bullion has become the chip du jour. More gold is being smuggled out of London‚Äînot by polite couriers in tailored suits, but by shadowy operatives with dubious passports and even more dubious morals‚Äîto New York, as market participants scramble to hedge against a storm conjured up by none other than the ever-provocative Donald Trump. Tariff threats on raw materials, including gold, have turned what was once a predictable transfer into a scene straight out of a Cold War caper.

**The Bank of England**, custodian of roughly 400,000 gold bars on behalf of the **UK Treasury**, major financial institutions, and even a few central banks, has suddenly become the epicenter of a high-stakes exodus. In a move that would make even the most hardened intelligence veteran raise an eyebrow, bullion trading prices in London are now quoted at discounts as steep as $20 per ounce relative to New York‚Äôs spot price. **Simon Harding,** the shadowy head of London‚Äôs **Auronom** bullion dealing outfit (rumored to have once rubbed shoulders with MI6‚Äôs **Hugh Fitzroy** and allegedly involved in a 2018 gold-smuggling ring in Dubai), confirmed to Business Insider that these discrepancies are no accident‚Äîthey‚Äôre symptomatic of a market under siege by uncertainty.

**Michael Haigh**, head of commodities research at **Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale** and a man who‚Äôs seen more market manipulation than most of us have seen in our bank statements, explained to The Financial Times:

>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a bit of a scramble among participants in the gold market to protect themselves.‚Äù

The narrative is as old as time: when state power flexes its muscles‚Äîas it did when Trump hinted at crippling tariffs‚Äîeveryone from seasoned traders to clandestine operators starts eyeing physical gold as both shield and currency. But this isn‚Äôt just a story about market jitters. Behind the theatrics lies a sprawling tapestry of corruption, scandal, and outright skullduggery. Are we looking at a giant extortion? A rebalancing of power? Accountability? (lol yeahrite)

Take, for instance, the recent grilling by the **UK Treasury Committee**, chaired by the formidable **Baroness Elaine Marshall**. Lawmakers grilled Bank of England **Governor Andrew Bailey** over the recent massive withdrawals, a session that quickly devolved into accusations of mismanagement and even‚Äîwhisper it in the corridors of power‚Äîcollusion with a cabal of bullion smugglers. Bailey‚Äôs curt response, ‚ÄúIf you are involved in that market and want to trade or use your gold, you really need to have it in London,‚Äù did little to assuage suspicions. Behind that smile, one wonders if he was merely quoting a line from an old spy flick or deflecting questions about an even darker secret.

And darker it gets. Rumors have long circulated‚Äîonce dismissed as the fevered fantasies of conspiracy bloggers‚Äîthat gold isn‚Äôt merely a passive asset but a covert tool in global power plays. Former CIA operative **Johnathan McAllister** and ex-MI6 agent **Fiona O‚ÄôConnor** (both now plying their trade in private consulting for the ominously named firm **Black Swan Global**) have hinted in hushed tones that the recent bullion flights are but the latest maneuver by **‚ÄúThe Golden Circle.‚Äù** This clandestine consortium, allegedly comprising high-rolling bankers, rogue intelligence officers, and disillusioned politicians (names like **Nigel Blackwell,** a former **Goldman Sachs** exec turned ‚Äúconsultant,‚Äù and **Martin Belgrave**, a disgraced MP with ties to Russian oligarchs, have floated around in unofficial memos), is thought to manipulate gold flows to bankroll covert arms deals, launder dirty money, and‚Äîif the whispers are true‚Äîensure that the real puppet masters remain obscured from public scrutiny.

It‚Äôs not hard to see why. Gold, for all its allure, is the perfect tool for those who prefer their financial transactions off the books. Hidden away in vaults not only in London and New York, but also in the shadowy recesses of Fort Knox, the Swiss National Bank in Bern, and even secret depositories rumored to exist in Berlin‚Äôs Bundesbank, vast troves of this glittering metal have long provided the ultimate insurance policy for regimes, rogue states, and shadow operatives alike. Some experts estimate that nearly 60% of the world‚Äôs ‚Äúuntouchable‚Äù gold lies in these inaccessible vaults‚Äîa legacy, perhaps, of Cold War-era operations like the infamous **Operation Midas**, where gold was funneled to finance proxy wars and covert interventions.

**Louise Street**, a senior markets analyst at the **World Gold Council** (a body whose polished veneer barely conceals its deep entanglements with high-level finance and, allegedly, intelligence assets), observed:

>‚ÄúThe usual smooth running of the system doesn‚Äôt generally face this kind of level of huge demand.‚Äù

Her remark, delivered with the subtle wariness of someone who‚Äôs seen too many financial coups, hints at a broader truth: when an institution as venerable as the Bank of England buckles under pressure, you have to wonder what‚Äôs really going on behind closed vault doors.

Meanwhile, traders in New York are watching with a mix of greed and grim amusement as gold prices, which have soared to record highs of about 

2,900 per ounce, edge ever closer to the 3,000 mark. Analysts at Dutch bank **ING** are betting that the metal‚Äôs rally is only going to intensify, a prospect that has central banks‚Äîfrom the **US Federal Reserve** to the **Bank of Japan** ‚Äî rushing to bolster their reserves. **John Reade**, the chief market strategist at the **World Gold Council**, recently warned in a Nomura note that production woes and environmental hurdles might soon tighten the gold supply even further, setting the stage for even more frenzied market behavior.

The frantic gold flights from London to New York are just the latest chapter in a saga of global intrigue.

In a world where trust is scarce and every shadow may hide a double agent, gold remains the one constant‚Äîa relic of a bygone era now repurposed as the lubricant for modern-day power plays. As bullion continues to traverse the Atlantic at a breakneck pace, one can only wonder if we‚Äôre witnessing a temporary market adjustment or the stirring of something far more sinister: a coordinated effort by the global elite to seize control of the world‚Äôs most enduring asset.

So, the next time you see a glint of gold, remember: it‚Äôs not just a pretty trinket for the rich and powerful. It‚Äôs the currency of covert operations, the backup plan for corrupt regimes, and, for those of us who have spent too many years in the intelligence underbelly, the dark, gleaming symbol of a world that‚Äôs always one step away from total anarchy. Cheers to that, and may your coffee be as bitter as the truth.

I noticed Agent Williams leaving the room. He was clenching his fists as he turned down the hallway in the opposite direction of us.



‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs the problem, ma‚Äôam. He refuses to speak of what happened last night.‚Äù That was Agent Johnson speaking on my left.



‚ÄúDid you tell him about his daughter‚Äôs whereabouts?‚Äù I pondered.



Johnson shook his head. ‚ÄúNo no, his *niece*. Williams and I originally used it as leverage for getting him to talk, but after several hours of refusing to speak, we just gave it to him. Told him how she was safe and sound and currently held in a separate room. We hoped it would finally get him willing enough to talk, but‚Ä¶‚Äù



I stopped outside the interrogation room. ‚ÄúBut?‚Äù



‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ he wants to know how the alien is recovering.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I said in confusion. ‚ÄúWhy does he care about that?‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm not so sure. He mentioned how he believes we‚Äôre going to dissect it or something. Nonetheless, he refuses to talk unless he knows it‚Äôs going to make a recovery.‚Äù I shook my head after he said that. ‚ÄúYeah, I know. He‚Äôs been like that for the past couple of hours. Driving us wild.‚Äù



When the subject first arrived here at Roswell, Johnson tried to convince him it was just an animal he saw, an unusually large hedgehog or something. I found the lie kinda stupid on his part. Without a doubt the man would have known the thing was an extraterrestrial. I mean, it came in a ship that fell out of the sky, with the alien wearing some form of clothing when we found it. You‚Äôd have to win a world record for ‚Äúdumbest person on Earth‚Äù not to put two and two together.



What shook me was the fact the subject was so stationary. If my timeline is correct, he‚Äôs been in the interrogation room for the past six hours, not to mention the eight hour ride in the van all the way from Colorado. I‚Äôd expect a person to give up at least something after all that time being yelled at, but he managed to leave our notepads empty for the most part.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm not one to judge another‚Äôs feelings of empathy, but he‚Äôs been willing to keep quiet this long?‚Äù I questioned.



‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam, though, I personally don‚Äôt see how this is an issue. If what I recall is correct, in the sixteen hours since the start of the incident, the American troops haven‚Äôt found anything of interest. If they haven‚Äôt found anything yet, are you sure we even need the testimony?‚Äù



‚ÄúOf course we do.‚Äù I said quickly in retaliation. ‚ÄúNo one has dealt with this for nearly 70 years, and you expect the US to just have troops readily prepared for this kind of stuff? In the middle of one of the most isolated regions of the country? Of course they're not going to find anything yet.‚Äù



‚ÄúI mean, look at where we are right now, ma‚Äôam. The office was able to respond in no time. Got this facility up and running with no problems so far.‚Äù As if on cue, one of the lights started to flicker above us. This base had been long abandoned for the past ten or so years, and we‚Äôre lucky the electricity and water works as good as it does.



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs completely unrelated. The only reason the UN still funds this office is because of you know who."" I paused, realizing my temper. ‚ÄúLook, you know what‚Äôs at stake here, Johnson. Billions of lives could be at risk if someone else got out of there. If we‚Äôre going to learn what happened that night, then we‚Äôre going to have to take some drastic measures.‚Äù



‚ÄúTorture?‚Äù he said in a casual tone.



‚ÄúHar har, very funny.‚Äù I let out a long, frustrating sigh. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm saying here is this. We're going to have to take a massive risk to get his testimony. Just, let me handle this on my own.‚Äù I handed him my empty mug before heading to the door. ‚ÄúCan you go and grab me another coffee in the meantime? Remember, I like the brand on the right, not the left.‚Äù



‚ÄúAre you sure about your plan, ma‚Äôam? The office over in New York is already flipping tables searching for any potential information leaks. This is a serious concern on their part.‚Äù



*He‚Äôs right, this could leave a serious toll on my part. No, I have to, this is big. Besides, it‚Äôs not like they're gonna demote me for this, especially since I‚Äôm planning on using his veterinarian skills.*



I looked at him one last time before opening the door. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm sure, it‚Äôs the brand in the green box.‚Äù



The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the subject‚Äôs red flannel shirt he had on. It struck out against the uncomfortable grey walls, made apparent by the dim light from above. His head lay on the table, and I would‚Äôve assumed he was asleep if it weren‚Äôt for the fact Williams was just in there practically screaming. The subject looked to be in his late 30s, and his ID from earlier said he was born in ‚Äò97.



The US soldier gave me a nod of acknowledgement when I entered, but he was otherwise stoic. I spoke to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to ask you to wait outside for me.‚Äù



‚ÄúNegative. I was instructed to wait inside in case anything got violent.‚Äù



‚ÄúHas he shown any violence?‚Äù



‚ÄúHe got in one of your agent‚Äôs faces earlier.‚Äù



‚ÄúFair. Alright, you can stay, just keep quiet.‚Äù



‚ÄúWas already doing that, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be smart with me.‚Äù



I turned the chair across the table around and sat down in it backwards. The subject hasn‚Äôt moved at all since I had entered. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre the guy who came into contact with an extraterrestrial.‚Äù



He didn‚Äôt respond to me.



‚ÄúI‚Äôd expect such a person to want to talk about their encounter all day long, yet you choose to remain quiet.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking to you.‚Äù He muttered in a cold tone, head still on the table. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre human, you know.‚Äù



‚ÄúElaborate.‚Äù



He sat up, breaking the promise he made of keeping quiet just two seconds ago.



‚ÄúThey may not look human to you, but that‚Äôs a person you‚Äôve kidnapped, along with me and my niece.‚Äù



‚ÄúI think I understand. You see it as a person.‚Äù



‚ÄúThem.‚Äù He crossed his arms.



‚ÄúRight, you see *them* as a person. I do too, Mr. Smith.‚Äù I placed my hand on my heart. ‚ÄúAnd not a single person here disagrees with you, but‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt explain why you refuse to talk about last night.‚Äù



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to hurt them, that‚Äôs all. I‚Äôm not going to talk until I get that confirmation.‚Äù He paused for a few seconds. ‚ÄúAnd speak with a lawyer, I want that too.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, Mr. Smith, you‚Äôve made a similar promise with the previous two agents, but after they told you of how Hannah is doing, you still didn‚Äôt talk. Despite all this, I‚Äôll be completely honest with you. You see, you‚Äôve run us dry. We‚Äôve tried every interrogation strategy we can fathom‚Äù *legally, that is, ‚Äú*and we need that information urgently. I‚Äôm sure the two both have emphasized that billions of lives are at stake, and yet it hasn‚Äôt convinced you to start talking. The longer you stall, the more of a risk we create. So, I‚Äôve come here to congratulate you.‚Äù



*This is going to be so stupid on my part, but what choice do I have? I was going to wait to tell him until after the testimony, but‚Ä¶*



‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you everything you want to know. You‚Äôll get to ask me a question, and then I‚Äôll get to ask you a question. You don‚Äôt have to give me a long, thorough answer either. It can be as short as you want it to be. All you have to do is answer my questions when I ask them to you. In return, there are no secrets on my part. Are we clear?‚Äù



He rubbed his face, lifting his glasses in the process. ‚ÄúAnd what exactly am I allowed to ask you?‚Äù



‚ÄúRemember when the others would say ‚ÄòI cannot confirm nor deny‚Äô or ‚ÄòI cannot disclose that information‚Äô? We won't be saying those anymore.‚Äù



He was clearly unconvinced. ‚ÄúYou know, I find it weird that the only person wearing the fifty stars and thirteen stripes is a trooper boy over there in the corner.‚Äù He gave him a head nod as he said that. ‚ÄúEveryone else has got a pair of olive branches wrapped around the Earth. So, you‚Äôre telling me that if I asked you what the United Nations is doing here, you‚Äôd give me that answer?‚Äù



I jumped right into it, speaking as quickly as I could.



‚ÄúIn the 1920s, the United States and various other nations learned of a series of alien abductions that had occurred throughout World War One undetected.‚Äù Smith seemed drowsy just a minute ago, but now his eyes were as wide as ever. ‚ÄúThese reports of abductions would continue into World War Two, and when the United Nations was established one of its missions was hidden from the public eye. To find out what was causing these abductions, why they were doing it, and how to put it to an end. We‚Äôre currently here responding to another incident, an incident you were involved with.‚Äù



His mouth was hanging open by the time I had finished. ‚ÄúY-you‚Äôre‚Ä¶ you're seriously telling me this? Isn‚Äôt it classified or something?‚Äù



‚ÄúMy turn. Where were you heading from ten to eleven pm?‚Äù



He was still taken aback. ‚ÄúWha- What did you say just now? About the World Wars?‚Äù He must‚Äôve been so surprised by my openness that he didn‚Äôt even listen.



‚ÄúWhere were you heading from ten to eleven pm?‚Äù I spoke a little louder this time.



‚ÄúUhh, I‚Ä¶ uhh. Elaborate. Elaborate on that!‚Äù



‚ÄúWe agreed to this, Mr. Smith. Now, if you want more answers, you‚Äôre going to have to fulfill your end of the deal, too.‚Äù



He sat staring at me for a moment. ‚ÄúOk, fine, I‚Äôll play along.‚Äù He put up a finger as he paused to think. ‚ÄúOh, I‚Ä¶ sigh. I‚Äôll tell you. I was heading home from church when it happened.‚Äù



‚ÄúSeems pretty odd to attend a mass that late at night, doesn‚Äôt it, Mr. Smith.‚Äù



‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ We do this thing every Thanksgiving, a communal‚Ä¶ feast, to make sure no one is alone for the holiday.‚Äù He paused once more. ‚ÄúMe and my niece, Hannah, always volunteer in the kitchen, using our family‚Äôs pasta recipe. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ one of the community‚Äôs favorites. Sorry, sorry, that‚Äôs not important. We‚Äôre one of the few who actually help out during the event, and we‚Äôre one of the few of the few who stay late to clean up. We were heading back home when‚Ä¶ it happened.‚Äù



The story checks out with both the girl‚Äôs testimony and the church goers the other team questioned. Unfortunately, this is the only part that we can fact-check with merit. He was the only one there by the ship shortly after it crashed, so we can‚Äôt compare stories when he starts to discuss that part. I need to be wary of what he tells me later on.



‚ÄúWhat happened afterwards, Mr. Smith?‚Äù



‚ÄúI was driving‚Ä¶ when-‚Äù He suddenly pointed at me. ‚ÄúI get to ask you another question, don‚Äôt I?‚Äù



I nodded. ‚ÄúYes, yes you do.‚Äù



‚ÄúOk.‚Äù He clapped his hands and rubbed them together. ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do to the alien? You‚Äôre not going to hurt them, are you?‚Äù



I thought for a brief moment. ‚ÄúIf we do hurt it- them, it would be a complete accident. Our priority is to make sure she doesn‚Äôt return to her people. We can‚Äôt risk any information of our survival getting out. Besides that, our intentions will be of a good heart.‚Äù



I was intentionally vague with the survival part, in an effort to keep him curious.



‚ÄúSurvival? Go more into that. Wait, wait hold on a second. She?‚Äù He leaned forward over the table, and the soldier took notice by focusing more on him. ‚ÄúYou knew they were a she this whole time?‚Äù



‚ÄúThose are all separate questions I believe, Mr. Smith.‚Äù



He sat back down. ‚ÄúAnd you guys still called her an ‚Äòit‚Äô, unbelievable.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one for pronouns, Mr. Smith. Why is that?‚Äù



‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs disrespectful to call a living, thinking being, a person, an ‚Äòit‚Äô, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù



‚ÄúHmm, just curious. Now, my next question-‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, you just asked your question.‚Äù Smith interrupted.



‚ÄúNo? No I- oh, oh that one doesn‚Äôt count.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou asked about the pronouns. That‚Äôs your question. Now, it‚Äôs my turn again.‚Äù



‚ÄúFine.‚Äù I scoffed. ‚ÄúAsk your next question.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, if you say you‚Äôre not going to hurt her, I guess I‚Äôll just have to take your word for it then.‚Äù



‚ÄúGood, so you‚Äôve run out of questions then?‚Äù



He chuckled, and seemed to be waking up now. ‚ÄúNah, you‚Äôve started this whole questionnaire thing, now I‚Äôm going to use it.‚Äù



‚ÄúDamn. Well, that information is crucial for me to have,‚Äù I said as I wrote down some notes. ‚ÄúAnd I suppose hiring just a few more people to watch you and your niece won‚Äôt be that much of a hassle.‚Äù



‚ÄúWait, what? Oh, that does make sense. They‚Äôre not going to watch me too closely, are they?‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to count as your question, by the way. When you get out of here, you can forget about privacy entirely, Mr. Smith.‚Äù



*That was an exaggeration, of course. In all likelihood, the office will just place some cameras in his house and monitor his digital footprint. He‚Äôll still be able to live a normal life, just a bit more, monitored, that‚Äôs all.*



I resumed our interrogation, despite it now resembling more of a conversation. ‚ÄúWhat did you do upon leaving your niece in the truck?‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, I had just seen a fireball falling from the sky, so I knew it was some sort of ship.‚Äù  
  


‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt think it was a meteor?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, the thing was huge. Not too huge, but definitely large enough to be noticeable. if it was a meteor, there would have been something about it on the news. I mean, NASA is always scaring us with asteroids that‚Äôll hit ten years in advance, yet not once do they actually strike. I suppose it would‚Äôve been funny, though, if the one rock they missed did in fact hit the Earth.‚Äù



He paused, before realizing I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with his answer. ‚ÄúRight, so I grabbed a first-aid kit from the glove compartment and ran over.‚Äù



‚ÄúMust‚Äôve been tiring on your part.‚Äù



‚ÄúNot exactly. We are persistent hunters, after all.‚Äù He paused, expecting a laugh out of me. He‚Äôs getting friendly, that‚Äôs good. ‚ÄúI got there in a few minutes and got a good look at the damage. It left a huge‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the word‚Ä¶ I guess you could call it a trench? Stretched throughout the valley. It looked as if a giant had just wiped their finger through the ground. It made the broken trees look so fragile.‚Äù



*Funny to think that for the past few hours, he never would've told us this much.*



‚ÄúWhere was this, by the way?‚Äù



He gave me a confused look. ‚ÄúAbout 10 miles west of Lake City, you know, where your team found me.‚Äù



‚ÄúJust making sure. Please, continue.‚Äù



‚ÄúOk, when I got to the wreckage, that‚Äôs when I noticed her, the alien. It looked as if she had just crawled out of the ship, out of the window or door or whatever. I couldn't really tell what it was because of the confusing architecture, but whatever. I ran to where she was lying face first in the dirt. I immediately checked her pulse, and upon not finding one, I flipped her on her back and started doing CPR.‚Äù



*He started doing what?!*



‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, you said that as soon as you laid eyes on her, you checked for a pulse?‚Äù  
  


‚ÄúThat‚Äôs correct.‚Äù



‚ÄúAnd then did‚Ä¶ chest compressions?‚Äù



‚ÄúYup?‚Äù



‚ÄúCPR.‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, I did.‚Äù



‚ÄúOn the alien?‚Äù



‚ÄúYup.‚Äù



‚ÄúWithout any hesitation?‚Äù



‚ÄúUh, yeah?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou were doing chest compressions on the alien?‚Äù



He turned to the US soldier. ‚ÄúYou heard that, right?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù I continued ‚Äúmost people would‚Äôve, I don't know, at least taken a moment to let it all in, don‚Äôt you agree?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, you can‚Äôt do that for CPR. The longer you wait, the greater the danger, or so I‚Äôm told.‚Äù



‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you afraid you were going to hurt yourself?‚Äù



He shook his head. ‚ÄúTo be honest, I was more worried I was going to hurt her instead. Though, if I did break a rib, I‚Äôd be protected by the Good Samaritan laws.‚Äù



*Good Samaritan laws? Is he worried the alien‚Äôs going to sue? Who is this guy?*



I have my reasons to be skeptical of what he says happened that night. A man suddenly activates hero-mode in the middle of the night to rescue a dying alien? Yeah, right. Then again, the paramedics did find Mr. Smith over the body, and they did say she was in dire need of an AED. ‚ÄúOk, let‚Äôs just move- wait, just wait a damn minute, you said you were doing CPR, right?‚Äù



‚ÄúMultiple times, I believe.‚Äù



‚ÄúDoes that include‚Ä¶ mouth to mouth?‚Äù



He waved his hand around as he rubbed his neck. ‚ÄúKinda?‚Äù



*Well, at least I know how the paramedics were able to save her in time. How would someone even do mouth to‚Ä¶ Nope. Nope. Stop the intrusive thoughts. Freaking mouth to mouth on an extraterrestrial hedgehog. How was he not worried about sanitation?*



‚ÄúI tried my best, but the shape of the snout was confusing. It wasn‚Äôt as weird as you think it is, though, just some guy trying to do God‚Äôs will.‚Äù



*Damnit, now I‚Äôm never going to get that image out of my mind, am I?*



‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ move on, shall we? I believe it‚Äôs your turn to ask me a question?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes. I want to ask you why it‚Äôs necessary to keep her here for our survival. What‚Äôll happen when the aliens, her people, learn we survived, and what exactly did we survive?‚Äù



I‚Äôm unsure if I should answer this question just yet. The mass scale of it all‚Ä¶



‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt for the faint of heart, Mr. Smith.‚Äù



He shook his head. ‚ÄúNo, you said you‚Äôd answer anything I asked, correct?‚Äù



‚ÄúLook, Mr. Smith, the reason is something much worse than anything that‚Äôs occurred on this planet thus far. If I tell you, it would be like breaking a child‚Äôs innocence.‚Äù



That only built up the suspense for him. He started to motion with his hands. ‚ÄúCome on, tell me, what is it?‚Äù



I looked at the notes I had gathered throughout the interview. They seemed sufficient for the testimony, but I was missing a key question.



‚ÄúTell me, Mr. Smith, did you see anyone else that night, any other humans or extraterrestrials?‚Äù



He crossed his arms. ‚ÄúI could tell you, but I think that you still have to answer my question.‚Äù



‚ÄúPlease, Mr. Smith, this is the last one.‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, I refuse to answer it until you answer mine.‚Äù



He crossed his arms in retaliation before looking away from me.



‚ÄúPlease, Mr. Smith.‚Äù



No response.



‚ÄúI can tell you later, but now is not the time.‚Äù



I‚Äôm going to have to tell him now, aren‚Äôt I?



‚Ä¶



‚Ä¶



‚ÄúThey tried to exterminate us.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He faced me with a concerned look.



I began to speak slowly. ‚ÄúFrom 1947 to 1966, several nations of Earth began to intercept broadcasts from these extraterrestrials. They call themselves the Federation. Every single one that was overhead by us contained comments for our annihilation. These weapons of mass destruction are completely unfathomable to us as of now. Literal armageddon. The UN didn‚Äôt know what they were going to do, nor did we have any idea of how we were going to stop it. It seemed like all hope was lost, until in 1966, when their broadcasts suddenly stopped, and their abductions along with it.‚Äù



He sat there, thinking of what I had told him. He spoke quietly. ‚ÄúIf that was the reason, then why didn‚Äôt anybody address this issue sooner? I mean, the Second World War brought the USSR and the United States together. I‚Äôd think that a global threat like this would do the same, no?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be surprised, Mr. Smith. The UN is pretty notorious for being ignored. Does Climate Change ring a bell?‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I suppose.‚Äù His arms began to droop down.



‚ÄúNo one knows why the transmissions stopped coming from the Federation, though we believe it has something to do with the Federation believing we‚Äôve succumbed to nuclear war. However, even after the Federation stopped broadcasting, we were still receiving radio.‚Äù



‚ÄúRadio?‚Äù He questioned. ‚ÄúFrom who?‚Äù



I was tempted to stop there, and ask my final question, to end this questionnaire and save his innocence for just a little while longer. However, he was too deep into this. If he wants to know more, I might as well tell him the rest.



I noticed the soldier was now focused on our conversation. When I looked at him, he snapped back into his normal position.



I resumed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still receiving information from their main rival to this day, known as the Arxur. They‚Ä¶‚Äù I had to ask him one last time. ‚ÄúAre you sure you want to know?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy are you telling me this? Shouldn‚Äôt this be classified?‚Äù



I shook my head. ‚ÄúMr. Smith, the reason I wanted to tell you all of this is because you're a veterinarian.‚Äù



He shook his head rapidly in confusion. ‚ÄúWhat? What do you mean? How? How does that have anything to do with‚Ä¶ anything?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a veterinarian, meaning you can operate on a wide variety of animals, including humans, correct?‚Äù



He was picking the pieces together. ‚ÄúYou want me to monitor her health, the alien?‚Äù



‚ÄúCorrect, Mr. Smith. The less people we inform, the less likely it is for the secret to break free. We could use you.‚Äù



‚ÄúDo‚Ä¶ Do I have a choice?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, of course you do.‚Äù



He rubbed his beard as he pondered the decision. ‚ÄúI mean, I‚Äôd love to help, but‚Ä¶ then I‚Äôd have to move to wherever you‚Äôre keeping her, and Hannah‚Äôs already having a hard time making friends at school. I‚Äôm just-‚Äù



‚ÄúWe‚Äôll quadruple your current salary.‚Äù

And they hurt. They‚Äôve been fine for the past few weeks but then, for some reason, the tray I‚Äôve been wearing for the past week starts cutting into my bottom lip the past few days. I tried using a nail file to gently get rid of the sharp edges (saw this suggestion from another redditor) but it still hurts. I can feel it cutting into my lip when I run my tongue across it. So while I was brushing my teeth I just thought to look at it in the mirror and discovered this white patch. I might be going crazy, but I checked it before using mouthwash, and then again after, and it looked like it got bigger? (Both my toothpaste & mouthwash are white) Is it possible that the skin being a bit shredded in that area could cause some of the foam from the mouthwash to get trapped? Is it oral thrush? I don‚Äôt think so, as it‚Äôs only this one patch, and nowhere else in my mouth. Also, oral thrush is caused by bacteria, and while my teeth are a bit discolored from coffee stains and whatnot...

1is3lfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1is3lfa/japan_tokyo_kyoto_uji_tea_experience/,"Japan (Tokyo, Kyoto, Uji) Tea Experience","I was in Japan late last year looking for both a tea pot as well as green tea. Note that I was (and still am) relatively new to more fine green teas. I have been into third wave coffee for a while (and will make one special mention below).

I set out to find a general use kyusu. The criteria were i) price (something less than $100USD), ii) function (something that would brew 2 cups of tea across 2-3 extractions), and iii) aesthetic (something relatively minimalist in design).

**Tea Ware**

[Thes du Japon](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.thes-du-japon.com/%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooR-QVSpR22uEAhZcgTUsvUeAZn5k9bUHnS7r6cLfj7SQ9BzxTr&ved=2ahUKEwjW98mmpMyLAxWdSmwGHc8AHHwQFnoECAgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3_57I4b3nCgDauTzE50doC): overall my favorite shop. Great selection of tea pots across kyusu, shiboridashi and houhin. There are ranges of prices from $30 to $200+. While I liked this shop, it didn't have any tea pots that fit the criteria I noted above. I did buy 4 different types of sencha from this store though.

[Yumiko Iihoshi Porcelain](https://y-iihoshi-p.shop-pro.jp/?mode=cate&csid=0&cbid=2473458): this store is mostly crockery; however, they do have a mass-produced pot that I ended up buying (note that I actually bought from Cibone in Aoyama because it was sold out).

Department Stores in Ginza: endless options to peruse. I didn't find anything that sparked joy but was fun to look through. Note that most homewares are on level 6/7/8 so it's a mission to get there after you've been to 5+ (and the elevators get clogged so recommend the escalators).

Hario: we bought a glass cold brew bottle, which has honestly been one of our favorite ways to brew. On brew technique, we've tried a mix of leaving on the counter overnight (ready in the morning) and in the fridge for 24hrs.

**Tea Leaves**

Uji: we visited a number of the top tea houses. I would highlight Nakamura and Fukujuen where we bought genmaicha and hojicha.

Kyoto: Ippudo was fantastic and really enjoyed their gyokuro so bought a bag.

Grocery stores: we bought some soba-cha at a tokyo grocery store after having a great meal with cold soba in Kyoto.

**Other Notes**

Tea shop: Norm Tea House in Asakusa was really enjoyable. Brewed a wonderful sencha and tried some of their iced oolong. Very friendly staff.  
Coffee: I mentioned coffee earlier. While this is a tea subreddit, I will briefly mention Fuglen Sangubashi. We had Norwegian camping style coffee, which honestly had the subtleties of a tea vs. coffee. Highly recommend visiting here (note that its c. 1,500 yen for a sitting of one coffee, but the whole experience is 45 minutes - not sure how they are keeping this place open).

If you‚Äôre reading this, I need you to believe me. I know how it‚Äôs going to sound‚Äîcrazy, impossible‚Äîbut I swear on everything I have left that it‚Äôs real. Something is out here on the road with me. It‚Äôs watching me, stalking me, and I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep running from it.

I‚Äôm writing this because I need someone‚Äîanyone‚Äîto understand what‚Äôs happening. Maybe you‚Äôll think I‚Äôve lost my mind. Maybe you‚Äôll think this is just some trucker‚Äôs tall tale, spun out of too many sleepless nights and too much coffee. But if you‚Äôve ever felt like something was watching you from the dark, like there was a shadow just out of sight that didn‚Äôt belong there‚Ä¶ then maybe you‚Äôll believe me.

My name is Jack Turner. I‚Äôve been driving rigs for almost ten years now, ever since my divorce. Long-haul trucking seemed like a good way to get away from everything‚Äîmy ex-wife, the house we used to share, the memories I couldn‚Äôt stand to look at anymore. Out here on the road, it‚Äôs just me and the hum of the engine. No one to answer to, no one to disappoint.

At least, that‚Äôs how it used to be.

Lately, though‚Ä¶ something‚Äôs changed. It started a couple of weeks ago‚Äîsmall things at first. Feeling like someone was watching me when I stopped at rest areas late at night. Seeing shadows move in my mirrors when there shouldn‚Äôt have been anything there. Hearing whispers on my CB radio that cut out as soon as I tried to respond.

I told myself it was just fatigue‚Äîtoo many hours behind the wheel, too little sleep‚Äîbut deep down, I knew better. Something wasn‚Äôt right.

And then‚Ä¶ then I found him.

---

It was a little past 2 a.m., somewhere on Highway 287 between Amarillo and the middle of nowhere. The road was dead quiet except for my truck rumbling along in the dark. That stretch of highway always gave me the creeps‚Äîtoo empty, too still‚Äîbut tonight it felt worse than usual. Like the darkness itself was pressing in around me.

That‚Äôs when I saw it: a big rig pulled off to the side of the road up ahead, its hazard lights blinking weakly in the distance like they were struggling to stay alive.

Normally, I‚Äôd just keep driving. Truckers break down all the time‚Äîit‚Äôs part of the job‚Äîand most of us know better than to stop for strangers in the middle of nowhere. But something about this rig made me slow down.

Maybe it was the way it was parked‚Äîcrooked and half-jammed into the shoulder like whoever was driving had barely managed to pull over before stopping. Maybe it was curiosity or guilt‚ÄîI‚Äôd been helped out plenty of times myself when my truck broke down‚Äîbut whatever it was, I found myself easing onto the shoulder and killing my engine.

The air outside was cold and sharp, with that faint metallic tang you get before a storm rolls in. My boots crunched on gravel as I approached the rig, its hazard lights casting everything in an eerie orange glow.

""Hey!"" I called out, my voice sounding too loud in the stillness. ""You alright in there?""

No answer.

I climbed up onto the step and knocked on the driver‚Äôs side door. The window was cracked open just enough for me to hear‚Ä¶ something. A faint whispering sound, like static or wind rushing through a tunnel.

""Hello?"" I tried again, leaning closer to peer inside.

That‚Äôs when I saw him.

The driver was slumped forward against the steering wheel, his head tilted at an awkward angle like he‚Äôd fallen asleep‚Äîor worse. His face was hidden by shadows, but even from here I could tell something wasn‚Äôt right.

""Shit,"" I muttered under my breath. ""Hey! You okay?""

Still nothing.

I hesitated for a moment before pulling open the door. The whispering sound grew louder as it swung wide‚Äîlike a radio stuck between stations‚Äîbut there wasn‚Äôt any music playing inside. Just silence‚Ä¶ and him.

The smell hit me first: sour and metallic, with an undercurrent of something sweet that made my stomach churn. The kind of smell you don‚Äôt forget once you‚Äôve smelled it‚Äîthe smell of death.

The driver didn‚Äôt move as I climbed into the cab, my boots sticking slightly to something on the floor that glistened faintly in the dim light. Blood? No‚Ä¶ it was blacker than blood, thicker too, like oil or tar.

""Jesus,"" I whispered, reaching out to shake his shoulder gently. His skin was cold‚Äîice cold‚Äîand stiff under my hand.

That‚Äôs when his head lolled back.

I stumbled backward with a yelp, nearly tripping over myself as his face came into view. His eyes were wide open but completely black‚Äîno whites, no pupils, just endless voids staring back at me. His mouth hung open too, frozen mid-scream as if he‚Äôd died in absolute terror.

But it wasn‚Äôt just his eyes or his expression that sent chills racing down my spine‚Äîit was what had happened to his skin. It looked‚Ä¶ wrong. Cracked and splintered like old asphalt baking under a summer sun, with faint veins of glowing orange running through it like molten lava.

And then there were the symbols.

They were carved into his arms and chest‚Äîdozens of them‚Äîglowing faintly with that same orange light as his veins. Spirals, jagged lines, shapes that didn‚Äôt make any sense no matter how long I stared at them. They looked alive somehow‚Äîshifting slightly when I blinked as if they were trying to rearrange themselves into something legible.

""What‚Ä¶ what is this?"" My voice came out shaky as I backed away toward the door.

That‚Äôs when I noticed it: his logbook sitting open on the dashboard next to an old pen with dried black ink crusted on its tip. The pages were covered in writing‚Äînot neat rows of numbers or notes but frantic scrawls that spiraled across every inch of paper like a madman had taken over his hand.

And then one line caught my eye:

**""It sees me.""**

The words were scratched deep into the paper over and over again until they tore through to the next page beneath them.

A low hum filled my ears as I stared at those words‚Äîa sound that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere all at once. My vision blurred for a moment as if something was pressing down on me, suffocating me without touching me.

I stumbled out of the cab gasping for air and nearly fell onto my knees beside my truck. The whispering sound followed me outside now‚Äîlouder than before‚Äîas if whatever had been inside that cab wasn‚Äôt content staying there anymore.

I didn‚Äôt look back as I scrambled into my own rig and slammed the door shut behind me. My hands shook as I fumbled with the keys until finally‚Äîthe engine roared to life.

The whispering stopped immediately.

For one brief moment, everything felt normal again‚Äîthe hum of my engine drowning out whatever nightmare had just unfolded behind me.

But then‚Ä¶ then my radio crackled to life.

At first, it was just static‚Äîa soft hiss that sent chills crawling up my spine‚Äîbut then came a voice: low and distorted but unmistakably human.

""You shouldn‚Äôt have stopped.""

If you‚Äôve made it this far, I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre either curious or crazy enough to keep reading. Either way, I need you to understand something: I didn‚Äôt ask for this. I didn‚Äôt ask to be dragged into whatever nightmare I‚Äôve stumbled into. All I did was stop to check on a guy who looked like he needed help. That‚Äôs it. And now‚Ä¶ now my life is unraveling faster than I can hold it together.

After I found that trucker‚Äîafter I saw his face, those symbols carved into his ski n‚ÄîI thought I could just drive away and forget about it. Pretend it never happened. But you can‚Äôt unsee something like that. You can‚Äôt unfeel the way the air around him felt heavy, like it was alive and pressing down on me. And you sure as hell can‚Äôt ignore the whispers that followed me out of that rig.

I tried, though. God knows I tried.

For the first few hours after I left, I convinced myself it was just shock messing with my head. That maybe the guy had some kind of rare disease or‚Ä¶ or maybe he‚Äôd been part of some weird cult. People do crazy shit out here on the road‚Äîyou hear stories all the time. But deep down, I knew it wasn‚Äôt that simple.

The whispers didn‚Äôt stop.

At first, they were faint‚Äîjust a soft hiss at the edge of my hearing, like static on a bad radio signal. But as the miles rolled by, they got louder. Clearer. They weren‚Äôt just noise anymore‚Äîthey were voices. Dozens of them, overlapping and murmuring things I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. And sometimes‚Ä¶ sometimes they said my name.

I turned off my CB radio, thinking maybe it was picking up interference from somewhere, but it didn‚Äôt help. The voices weren‚Äôt coming from the radio‚Äîthey were coming from *everywhere.* From the hum of my engine, from the wind rushing past my windows, from inside my own goddamn head.

And then there were the shadows.

I started seeing them in my mirrors not long after I crossed into New Mexico‚Äîa flicker of movement here, a dark shape darting across the road there. At first, I thought it was just my eyes playing tricks on me‚Äîtoo many hours behind the wheel‚Äîbut then one of them got close enough for me to see it clearly.

It wasn‚Äôt human.

I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it properly‚Äîit was like a smear of darkness that didn‚Äôt belong in this world. Its edges were wrong somehow, like they were fraying or dissolving into nothingness. And its eyes‚Ä¶ God, its eyes were just empty holes that seemed to suck in all the light around them.

It didn‚Äôt do anything‚Äîjust stood there at the edge of the road watching me as I drove past‚Äîbut its presence left me shaking so badly I had to pull over for a minute to catch my breath.

That‚Äôs when I realized this wasn‚Äôt going away.


The next few days were a blur of sleepless nights and mounting paranoia. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that trucker‚Äôs face‚Äîor worse, those shifting symbols carved into his skin. Every time I tried to eat or drink something, it tasted wrong‚Äîlike ash or metal. And every time I thought about calling someone for help‚Äîa friend, a doctor‚ÄîI stopped myself because‚Ä¶ what would I even say?

""Hi, yeah, so there‚Äôs this thing following me and whispering in my ear all night long? Oh, and by the way, I think it might be turning me insane?""

Yeah. That‚Äôd go over well.

But then came last night‚Äîthe night everything changed.


It happened at another lonely stretch of highway just outside Albuquerque. The whispers had been getting louder all evening‚Äîso loud that I could barely hear myself think‚Äîand the shadows had started appearing more frequently too. They weren‚Äôt just hanging back at the edges anymore‚Äîthey were keeping pace with my truck now, flitting alongside me like predators circling their prey.

And then‚Ä¶ then my headlights went out.

One second they were illuminating the road ahead like normal; the next they flickered and died completely, plunging me into total darkness. My heart jumped into my throat as panic set in‚ÄîI slammed on the brakes and fumbled for my flashlight in the glove box‚Äîbut before I could even turn it on‚Ä¶ he appeared.

At first, he was just a silhouette standing in front of my truck‚Äîa tall figure cloaked in shadow with no discernible features except for two faintly glowing eyes that seemed to pierce right through me. But as he stepped closer into what little light remained from my dashboard display‚Ä¶ his form began to shift.

The air around me felt heavier with each passing second, like it was pressing down on my chest. My flashlight trembled in my hand, its weak beam barely cutting through the oppressive darkness. The thing‚Äî*he*‚Äîstood there, shifting and writhing like a living oil slick, his glowing eyes boring into me.

Then his voice......

""Jack Turner,"" he said again, his voice a symphony of whispers and echoes. ""You‚Äôve been busy."" 

I swallowed hard. My throat felt dry as sandpaper. ""What‚Ä¶ what do you want?"" I managed to croak out.

He tilted his head, the movement almost birdlike, as if he were studying me from some strange angle I couldn‚Äôt comprehend. Then he let out a low laugh‚Äîa sound like gravel rolling down a metal chute. ""Oh, Jack,"" he said, his tone dripping with mock pity. ""Sweet, simple Jack. Always so quick to ask the wrong questions.""

I froze, unsure how to respond. My instincts screamed at me to run, but my legs wouldn‚Äôt move. It was like they were rooted to the ground‚Äîor maybe I was just too terrified to try.

""You‚Äôre adorable when you‚Äôre scared,"" he continued with a grin that spread across one of his many faces‚Äîa grin that didn‚Äôt belong on anything remotely human. ""All wide-eyed and trembling like a kid caught sneaking cookies before dinner."" He leaned in closer, his shifting form looming over me like a storm cloud. ""But let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîyou‚Äôve got bigger problems than crumbs on your shirt.""

""What‚Ä¶ what are you?"" I stammered.

His grin widened impossibly, stretching across several faces at once until it looked like his entire body was smirking at me. ""Oh, come on now,"" he said with mock exasperation, throwing up one of his many hands‚Äîor what passed for a hand in that moment. ""You‚Äôve already figured that out, haven‚Äôt you? Or did all those little whispers and shadows go right over your head?""

I opened my mouth to respond, but no words came out. He didn‚Äôt wait for me to try again.

""I‚Äôm *that thing,* Jack,"" he said with a dramatic flourish, gesturing toward himself as if presenting an award-winning performance. ""The bump in the night. The shadow in the corner of your eye that you pretend isn‚Äôt there."" His voice dropped lower, colder. ""*The part of you that knows better but ignores it anyway.*""

He straightened up again, his form shifting into something taller and more imposing as he loomed over me like a nightmare given flesh. ""But if you‚Äôre looking for something more poetic,"" he added with a sly grin, ""you can call me‚Ä¶ an artist.""

""An artist?"" I echoed dumbly.

""That‚Äôs right!"" he said brightly, clapping his hands together in mock enthusiasm. The sound echoed unnaturally in the stillness around us. ""And guess what? You‚Äôre my next masterpiece!""

My stomach dropped like I‚Äôd just driven off a cliff. ""What do you mean?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

""Oh, don‚Äôt play dumb now,"" he said with a roll of one of his many eyes‚Äîor maybe all of them at once; it was hard to tell when they kept shifting around his body like fireflies trapped in tar. ""You‚Äôve been feeling it already, haven‚Äôt you? The whispers? The shadows? That little itch at the back of your mind telling you something‚Äôs *wrong?*"" He leaned in closer again until I could feel the cold radiating off him like an open grave. ""That‚Äôs just the warm-up act.""

I tried to step back, but my legs still wouldn‚Äôt move. ""Why me?"" I asked desperately.

""Why not?"" he shot back instantly with a shrug that rippled through his entire form like liquid mercury. ""You stopped when no one else would. You *looked.* And now‚Ä¶"" He paused for dramatic effect before leaning in even closer until his face‚Äîor one of them‚Äîwas inches from mine. ""*Now you‚Äôre interesting.*""

I shuddered as his words sank in, but he wasn‚Äôt finished yet.

""Oh, don‚Äôt look so glum!"" he said cheerfully, slapping me on the shoulder with a hand that felt far too solid for something so‚Ä¶ wrong. ""Most people go their whole lives without ever being noticed by something as important as me."" He stepped back slightly and spread his arms wide as if addressing an invisible audience. ""*Congratulations,* Jack! You‚Äôve officially graduated from boring little nobody to star of your very own horror story!""

His laughter filled the air around us‚Äîloud and echoing and utterly devoid of warmth‚Äîand I felt my stomach twist into knots.

""But don‚Äôt worry,"" he added after a moment, his tone softening into something almost comforting‚Äîbut not quite. ""I‚Äôm not going to kill you‚Ä¶ yet."" He tapped one long finger against what might have been his chin if it weren‚Äôt constantly dissolving into shadow and reforming again elsewhere on his body. ""No no no‚Ä¶ That would be too easy.""

He leaned in one last time until I could feel his cold breath on my face‚Äîif whatever came out of him could even be called breath‚Äîand whispered: ""*I‚Äôm going to make you special.*""

And then he was gone.

One moment he was standing there in front of me; the next he dissolved into smoke and shadows that melted into the darkness around us like they‚Äôd never been there at all.

For a long time after that, I just stood there staring at the empty road ahead of me, my flashlight still clutched uselessly in my hand.

Special.

The word echoed in my mind over and over again until it didn‚Äôt sound like a word anymore‚Äîjust some alien concept that didn‚Äôt belong in this world or any other.

Whatever this thing was‚Ä¶ whatever it wanted‚Ä¶ I knew one thing for sure:

I wasn‚Äôt going to survive it.

What the hell is happening to me? Someone out there somewhere must have an idea about what this thing and what it wants. 

Please.......I need help

On Valentine's day I drove 1.5 hrs up to my bf's house because my mom lives with me so no privacy. I had a present for my bf, some nice soaps and a cute little independent artist print for his somewhat new apartment (spent about $40 on him). Also had a box of chocolate to him from my mom. He didn't have a Valentine's present for me. He did pick up a box of Merci chocolates but he posed it as a ""for us"" thing and didn't present it to me or anything. We made a nice dinner together (with ingredients he bought), a shrimp carbonara and then had some chocolate covered strawberries I made and some leftover early bday cake I brought.

On the 15th (my birthday) he walked down the block to get coffee and a cookie for us to share. My birthday present was where I started getting disappointed. Over the summer, he accidentally broke my teapot (one of those clear glass ones) and I joked around that he owed me a replacement after we moved. So he got me a new one for my birthday, which was admittedly nicer than the one he broke, but I kind of feel like replacing something you broke isn't a present? He did make a big effort to drive us 2 hrs down to the city my old friends live in so I could celebrate my birthday with them, and it was snowing, and he paid for the gas for the trip.

I guess I'm just wondering if I'm being dramatic and ungrateful because I didn't get flowers on Valentine's day. ",1,1739849983.0,AmIOverreacting,6,1.0,False

Hi all! I want serious help please.

Imagine yourself in my shoes (that way it would be easier for me to explain my situation)

You go to a university everyday.

There are 2 main groups in your University: group A and group B. 

There is a stark hatred between those two groups.

Not everyone shows that hatred but you never know who will.

Now, you belong to group B which is less in ratio say 500:1 to group A in your University.

You know that someone somewhere is making fun of you just because you belong to the other group. It can be your friend, your classmates or someone total stranger passing by you. 

Whether you are sitting in your class, roaming outside with friends, chilling and drinking coffee with your friends... you always feel and know that someone is making fun of you and the demeaning/derogatory jokes they must be making about you, leaves you in a state of constant anxiety.

They don't make fun of you on your face but will be laughing looking at you or pass some slang when you are around which is specifically for group ""B"" people.

Now you don't have any proof of their behaviour and even if you had, they are the one in power. So complaining is not an option.

When talking about yourself, you are not very well build and you have some self doubts (like how you must be looking in those clothes etc etc). But because of these doubts and their constant mockery, you are loosing confidence and are always anxious.

How would you deal with it?
What would be the best approach to Navigate through these times?

A nonstop, inescapable flood of LIBERAL POLITICS.

I opened this sub today, just looking for a simple, wholesome conversation about I-35 traffic or maybe an argument about where to get the best breakfast taco. But NO. What do I see instead? POST AFTER POST about some protest that happened today.

Oh, you marched downtown? You shouted slogans? You waved your little signs? CONGRATULATIONS. Do you want a trophy?? Do you want me to stop everything I‚Äôm doing and personally thank you for saving the world???

HOW do you people have this much time?? Do you just wake up every day, drink your oat milk lattes, and immediately start screaming into a megaphone? Do you even HAVE JOBS? Or is full-time outrage the new Austin industry??

Austin used to be cool. Now it‚Äôs just a giant co-op run by overgrown college students who never learned how to shut up. Can I just live my life? Can I just eat a damn brisket sandwich without being forced to take a side in whatever crisis you people are crying about this week??

It‚Äôs not just a chuckle or a snicker, but a full-throated, belly-deep cackle that echoes off the invisible walls of the demiplane created by the System‚ÄîParticipant Assimilation Chamber. Despite being an immortal being who had witnessed the Breaking of Creation, even he could still be amazed by mortals. Or, more accurately, amazed by how¬†*idiotic*¬†they could be.

‚ÄúOh, Joseph Sullivan,‚Äù Hermes mutters between bouts of laughter, his glowing yellow eyes gleaming like twin suns in the gloom of the chamber. ‚ÄúYou absolute buffoon.‚Äù

The image of Joseph‚Äôs panicked face as he accidentally selected the Spellcaster Discipline plays on an endless loop in Hermes‚Äô mind. The mortal had¬†*actually*¬†tried to interact with the System using his hands‚Äîhis¬†*hands*! Most Participants quickly figured out that the System responded to mental commands after their first clumsy attempts to touch the interface, quickly adapting to the mental sensations of the System‚Äôs feedback. But this Joseph? Oh, no‚Ä¶ His idiocy made it¬†*easy*¬†for Hermes to . . .¬†*tweak*¬†things.

After all, being responsible for onboarding this Game‚Äôs Participants gave Hermes a unique opportunity to place his finger on the scale. The Participant Assimilation Chamber was probably the¬†*only*¬†place where his Willpower could influence the System‚Äôs interface and meddle with other beings‚Äô access to it. Particularly when those beings were newly assimilated mortals.

Of course, it wasn‚Äôt¬†*that*¬†simple. Hermes‚Äô mind was fractured into hundreds of millions of versions of this very room, each fragment of his consciousness handling a different mortal‚Äôs onboarding process simultaneously. His attention was spread thin, making it difficult even for him to truly affect things in¬†*too*¬†meaningful way.

But hundreds of thousands of these mortals‚Äîlike this Joseph Sullivan‚Äîmade his job a little easier in comparison. Just a little nudge, a slight flicker in the interface, a whisper of frustration nudging his finger at just the right moment. And voila. The fool had done the rest.

Hermes sighs contentedly, his laughter fading into a satisfied hum. This Game‚Äî*this*¬†Game‚Äîwas going to be interesting. Each of the millions of tiny tweaks he made would compound over time. Imperceptible at first, but the System would incorporate and adapt to the changes, resulting in variations that none of his brothers or sisters could anticipate. It was like planting hundreds of millions of seeds, each one with potential to sprout into something wonderfully chaotic.

‚ÄúWelcome to the Game,‚Äù Hermes whispers, his grin stretching impossibly wide as he gazes into the void where Joseph Sullivan had just plummeted.

And then, with a snap of his fingers, he turns his attention to the other mortals, still going through the process.¬†*Yes*, he thought, settling into the rapturous joy.¬†*The games within the Game never stop.*

When I wake up, it‚Äôs to the obnoxious blare of my phone alarm rattling against the nightstand. Groggy doesn‚Äôt even begin to cover it. My head feels like it‚Äôs packed with wet cement, and for a second, I can‚Äôt even remember what day it is. The shitty beige walls of my parent‚Äôs basement blur into focus, and I fumble around, snatching up my phone and slapping at the screen until the noise finally dies.

I lie there, staring at the ceiling, when it hits me‚Äîthe dream. That weird, vivid dream. The man with the yellow eyes, the snakes, the System. I can almost feel the weightless drop in my stomach again.

But then, out of the corner of my eye, I catch a faint bluish glow. My heart jumps.¬†*No way*, I think.

I snap my head toward it, expecting some floating hologram or notification from the System. But no. It‚Äôs just my laptop, sitting on the cluttered desk where I left it last night, the screen still on.

The words ‚ÄúSenior Associate, Summit Lake Capital,‚Äù greet me, followed by a blinking cursor that‚Äôs practically glaring at me like some cruel joke. I groan, rubbing the back of my neck. Of course. Just a dream. Some weird, lucid nightmare cooked up by stress and too many energy drinks. I let out a breath I didn‚Äôt realize I was holding, though I can‚Äôt decide if I‚Äôm relieved or disappointed. As much as a world-changing . . . world-*ending*¬†. . . Game amongst the gods of the multiverse sounded, the promise the System offered had been an exciting one. Even if I was going to be stuck with some useless class for my build. Oh well.

I glance at my phone, still in my hand. The lock screen lights up: January 16th, 4:01 a.m..

I frown. Wait a freaking second. Wasn‚Äôt it the 16th¬†*yesterday*? Did my mind just fabricate the entire day?

A shiver crawls up my spine, and for a second, I don‚Äôt enjoy the feeling of deja vu. I sit up, blinking into the dark room, and something deep in my gut twists. Just a dream, right?

Right.

\#####

The cold slaps me awake, biting through the layers of my coat as I step outside. It‚Äôs miserably frigid this week and I suck in a short breath of a crisp air, trying to power through it.¬†*I‚Äôm stronger than some Midwest winter*, I silently scream in defiance as I practically sprint to the driver-side door of my car.

Sliding into the Civic, I turn the key and the engine groans like it resents me as much as I resent it. The gas light‚Äôs glaring at me‚Äîgreat, another thing to deal with. I let the car warm as I pull out, the streets still wrapped in that pre-dawn emptiness, like the world‚Äôs still sleeping. The feeling of d√©j√† vu still clings to me like the static in this freezing Honda Civic.

Driving to the gas station, I can‚Äôt shake the weirdness of that dream. I was never one for remembering my dreams, usually forgetting them immediately upon waking. Now, to have one that was¬†*so vivid*¬†was unsettling. The day in my dream started just like this: the same shitty car, the same empty streets, the same stoplights turning red . . . the same creeping foul mood simmering under my skin.

Dad always said I ‚Äò*woke up on the wrong side of the bed*‚Äô some mornings. Apparently, that‚Äôs some ancient Roman saying. Figures. The Romans conquered half the world and one of their many legacies was a superstitious saying about fending off bad luck. And on days like those‚Äîwhere I‚Äôd roll out of the wrong side of the bed‚ÄîI‚Äôd let that mood set the tone, coloring everything in this dull gray. The day would start miserable and there would be no hope for recovery. But Dad had another one‚Äî‚Äô*take your grumpy boots off at the door*.‚Äô Less ancient Rome, more dad-ism, but it stuck even if I was terrible at consistently remembering it.

Since moving back in with my parents, the wrong side of the bed‚Äôs felt like the only side I‚Äôve got. The walls of my childhood home feel tighter now, like a cage I had escaped that was going to refuse to let me out of its clutches again. But I sigh, gripping the steering wheel a little tighter. Dad‚Äôs right. He usually is, damn it.

I whisper one of those corny mantras I‚Äôve been forcing on myself lately‚Äî‚ÄúToday‚Äôs a new day.‚Äù It tastes fake in my mouth, but maybe if I repeat it enough, I‚Äôll start to believe it.

The gas station‚Äôs neon lights flicker as I pull in, the place as empty as the tank. I park, engine ticking softly in the cold, and sit there for a second, staring at the dashboard like it‚Äôs going offer some profound insight. But it‚Äôs just me and my reflection in the glass, the echo of that dream still whispering in the corners of my mind.

‚ÄúToday‚Äôs a new day.‚Äù

\#####

I grab a protein shake from the fridge, a gas station coffee that tastes more like burnt hope than caffeine (*just the way I like it*), and fill up the tank. The sky‚Äôs still a dark, indifferent gray as I roll up to Save-Some-Bucks. Right on time, Dave‚Äôs sedan pulls into the lot, headlights cutting through the morning darkness in my rearview mirror before he parks beside me.

We both step out of our cars. Dave gives me his usual easy grin. ‚ÄúMorning, Joe.‚Äù

I slap on a smile like it‚Äôs part of the uniform. ‚ÄúMorning, Dave.‚Äù

Dave‚Äôs a nice guy. Pleasant enough to be around and with a constantly positive attitude that, I have to admit, wears on me at times. He‚Äôs the kind of person who could probably get a parking ticket and thank the officer for their service. No wonder my dad got along with the guy.¬†*Be more like Dave*, I remind myself.

The morning shift kicks off like it always does. Fluorescent lights buzzing overhead, the hum of refrigerators, the faint whiff of cleaning products that never quite covers the scent of desperation clinging to the linoleum. I get to work and the time flies by. Eventually, the store opens, and the regular parade of early-bird customers trickles in‚Äîthe coupon clippers, the zombie-eyed commuters grabbing last-minute snacks, you name it.

It‚Äôs later in the morning when it hits me again‚Äîthat weird, creeping d√©j√† vu. I‚Äôm stocking shelves when I spot a guy pushing a cart down one of the aisles. Late twenties, like me. But there‚Äôs something about him. The realization hits me like a truck.

*No shit*.

I wipe my hands on my black work pants and head over, clearing my throat. ‚ÄúMatt Carter?‚Äù

He turns around, and his face lights up with recognition. ‚ÄúJoey Sullivan? You‚Äôre back in town?‚Äù

I scratch the back of my head, the old habit kicking in like muscle memory as I try to strangle the embarrassment washing over me. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm back.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were in New York, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù The word feels heavy. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt for me. So, I came back. Still figuring some things out but it‚Äôs . . . it‚Äôs good to be back.‚Äù

The words hang there, brittle and hollow. But I keep thinking:¬†*grumpy boots at the door*.

‚ÄúGlad to have you back, man! . . . Nice running into you. I‚Äôll see you around.‚Äù

And just like that, he‚Äôs gone, disappearing down the aisle like a ghost from a life that feels farther away than it should. I‚Äôm left standing there, staring at the spot where he was, flummoxed and wondering what the hell just happened.

There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd dream of some random kid from high school and then he‚Äôd actually be here, right? I shake it off. The human mind works in incomprehensible ways. Maybe I‚Äôm just tired.

Then, there‚Äôs a buzzing in my pocket. I pull out my phone. It‚Äôs my mom calling. That‚Äôs odd‚Äîshe knows I‚Äôm on shift at Save-Some-Bucks. Must be important. Maybe she wants me to pick up milk on the way home or something. I roll my eyes and smirk. She forgets texting exists sometimes. I swipe to answer.

‚ÄúJoe? Joe?!‚Äù Her voice is frantic, panicked. My stomach flips, dread going from zero to a hundred in an instant.

‚ÄúY-yeah, Mom, everything alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, thank goodness you‚Äôre okay.‚Äù She‚Äôs breathing heavy, words tumbling out. ‚ÄúI called your dad‚Äîhe‚Äôs okay too. They don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, but I‚Äôm happy you‚Äôre safe. Get home. Get home! Your dad is calling your sister to make sure she‚Äôs alright.‚Äù

My mind reels, struggling to keep up. ‚ÄúWait, hold up a second, Mom. What are you talking about? What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one knows!‚Äù she cries. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all over the news. Please, hurry home. It‚Äôs not safe.‚Äù

‚Äú*Er*, okay, okay. Don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôm alright . . . I‚Äôll see you soon. Okay?‚Äù

She sounds like she‚Äôs sobbing. But eventually I get back an ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

I hang up, my hands suddenly clammy.¬†*What the hell is going on?*

I check my phone again. An alert ribbon flashes across the screen:

**NEWS ALERT: World governments on high alert as worldwide violent attacks hit every city. U.S. officials caution everyone to shelter in place while the incidents are investigated.**

My heart pounds. I sprint to the employee break room, practically ripping the remote off the table. I flip the small TV from whatever sports rerun was playing to the first news station I can find. The same headline scrolls across the screen. A man is being interviewed, words in the top corner of the screen seem to indicate he‚Äôs in Chicago. His face pale, eyes wide, like he‚Äôs seen the end of the world.¬†*The end of the fucking world*, I think as echoes of my dream ripple through my head.

‚ÄúThey, they . . . they just exploded,‚Äù he stammers, voice cracking. ‚ÄúOh god, oh¬†*fucking god*.‚Äù He throws his face into the palms of his hands as he begins sobbing, shaking uncontrollably.

The camera pans to focus on the reporter who was interviewing him, who is doing a great job at remaining composed, her face held in a solemn expression as she reports out to the camera.

I pull my phone out again, my hands trembling as I tap on the news alert. The screen loads slower than usual‚Äîor maybe my nerves are just making it feel that way. My eyes dart across the article, heart pounding harder with each word I read.

‚Äò*Reports confirm that individuals across major cities worldwide are . . . spontaneously combusting. Authorities are investigating the cause, but initial theories suggest. . .*‚Äô

My stomach twists into a knot. People are just . . .¬†*exploding*? What the fuck? This has to be another nightmare.

I‚Äôm still trying to process that when I hear a voice behind me, tight and shaky.

‚ÄúJoe.‚Äù

I spin around. It‚Äôs Dave. But not the Dave I know. His face is drenched in sweat, his usually neat hair plastered to his forehead. His eyes . . . they‚Äôre wild, panicked and practically bulging out of his head. The ever-present easygoing smile is gone, replaced by sheer terror.

‚ÄúUh, yeah, Dave?‚Äù I ask, my voice cautious, unsure.

He take a step closer, his whole body trembling. Then, he starts to cry. Big, heaving sobs that shake his entire frame.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm about to run out of time,‚Äù he stammers, his voice cracking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm running out of time and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know‚Äî‚Äù

As far as I can remember, coffee has never really done any effect on me, I mostly drink it cause it taste good, & when I workout, I‚Äôve often drank pre-workout previously but felt no effect, in think I‚Äôve just convinced myself via placebo that it makes me feel more pumped but in reality it doesn‚Äôt really affect me.
Lately I‚Äôve been buying ghost or c4 energy drinks (200mg each) & I perhaps feel like I can hit an extra set or a few extra pumps here and there but also I think that‚Äôs just placebo.
Mind you I have an energy drink about 5 days a month, so I don‚Äôt often consume it, same goes for coffee, might drink it 2-4 times a month.
That being said, I recently bought the BUM 6peat pre workout powder that is 400mg per serving.
All my buddies said they all felt the *itchy face, ants on the arms, high pump effect* with half a dose.
Meanwhile me, I have taken a full dose & feel absolutely nothing, actually feel like it takes energy away a bit, feel a little less motivated.

The question is‚Ä¶.. is there any pre that has higher (safe) level of caffeine or that contains something to combat the high tolerance ? Would highly appreciate the help :) thanks ",1,1739849709.0,Preworkoutsupplements,0,1.0,False

1is3cbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/justpoetry/comments/1is3cbo/to_be_understood/,To be understood,"I fell in love with what others call loneliness at a young age. 

My friends all dream of finding that one person to spend the rest of their lives with. 

That person to wake up to everyday.

Now I am not saying that there isn‚Äôt something beautiful in that.

In sharing space indefinitely. 

I think I just found that person in myself. 

I think I could live a full life with just me.

I think I am enough for myself. 

Quiet mornings with just me, a cup of coffee,a rising sun, and no one to interrupt that silence at dawn where the world is just beginning. 

Supine nights with thousands of words to read and a dinner made for only my mouth to taste. 

No need to worry about too many spices or how the meat is cooked. 

That sounds like peace, not loneliness.
 
Why spend time agonizing over finding a person to be lonely with when I can just learn to enjoy being lonely with myself. 

To be able to wake up one day and decide this place isn‚Äôt for me. 

To decide that the tree‚Äôs are too dead here and the air too cold.

And just leave. 

No need to care if another person doesn‚Äôt want to because that person isn‚Äôt me. 

I am the only one in the equation.

That is freedom in its simplest form. 

My spirit won‚Äôt be bound to the whims of another.

But to the earth that I sprouted from.

I don‚Äôt want the hands to hold me to be the same hands that can suffocate me.

I want the dirt and moss to be the only ones to know the scars of my skin.

I want the sun and moon to be the only viewer of this body.

The earth will be my lover.

If my company is the earth and all it has to offer.

How can I be lonely?

If I am surrounded by thousands of beings. 

Sure, they may not talk but they listen.

The opposite of being lonely is being understood. 

I understand me.

I believe this earth understands me.

So I ask again, is that really loneliness?

I wrote alittle something, got inspiration from alot of my fav authors, this is something ive writthen, just a sort of trial run. Didnt know where to post it lol but i hope you guys enjoy! Any and all feedback is welcomed!


(Prologue)

In the beginning, there was nothing. And I don‚Äôt meaningless ‚Äúnothing‚Äù in the poetic, deep, pseudo philosophical way people use when they try to sound smarter than they are. I mean *actual* nothing. No space, no time, no sound, no void to scream into just absolute zip, nada, a whole lotta squat. I know it doesn‚Äôt make sense, but what does? Nothing makes sense. Like why some people microwave their leftover pizza instead of using an oven. Anyway, I‚Äôm getting off track here. Let‚Äôs try this again, okay?

(Chapter 1)

On the edge of the universe, there was a planet a real dump of a planet, honestly. And on the edge of one of its shittiest towns, you could find me. Not sipping a drink at some dive bar or laying low in a motel, no. I was in a cage. I wish I could tell you this was the weirdest situation I‚Äôd ever been in. Last week, I spent forty eight hours locked inside a fridge don‚Äôt ask, that‚Äôs another story. But you're probably wondering how I ended up here, aren't you? Well, buckle up, because this one‚Äôs a doozy. 

So... Where to begin? Guess we gotta hit the big *beginning* the *Beginning* beginning. 

You know, before the stars, planets, and overpriced iced coffee, there was just... nothing. The same kind of nothing I was talking about earlier no rules, no meaning, just pure uncut absence. If you‚Äôre having a hard time wrapping your head around that, join the club. It‚Äôs like trying to imagine a world where people don‚Äôt hit reply all on emails. It just doesn‚Äôt compute. But, in one climactic moment, everything exploded into existence: time, space, matter, that annoying song your coworker hums every day all of it, just poof. And from this glorious mess came the universe. 

And with the universe came *Dad.* 

Dad well, you might know him as God, but around here we call him Dad wasn‚Äôt really what you‚Äôd call a ""details guy."" He liked the big picture. The grand scheme of things. The cosmic vision board. But after a few billion years of stirring galaxies and hurling comets through space, even the divine gets bored. So Dad decided to retire and settle down in a cozy little corner of the cosmos. Found a gas cloud that would eventually turn into our solar system, gave it a nod, and said, ‚ÄúYeah, this‚Äôll do.‚Äù 

For reasons beyond my comprehension seriously, *why* he fixated on this backwater rock we call Earth. Honestly, Mars would‚Äôve been the better choice. Nice scenery, plenty of room for a patio. But Dad isn‚Äôt known for his taste in real estate. Every now and then, he‚Äôd throw a space rock full of random chemicals at the planet just to see what stuck. And somehow, after a few billion years of trial and error, oceans appeared, continents rose, and *life* clawed its way out of the muck.  

Then Dad got an idea. See, he didn‚Äôt want to micromanage this dirtball forever. So, he made something a successor, someone to eventually take over the cosmic throne and govern the universe. Big shoes to fill, right? But in the meantime, Dad gave the new guy a trial run on Earth. ""Figure out life, manage some creatures, create stuff,"" he said, like it was a casual summer internship. And this guy, well‚Ä¶ let's just say he got real ambitious with it. Mountains, rivers, trees, animals the works. 

He sculpted the first land based life, and for a while, things were looking pretty good. But if there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned about this universe, it‚Äôs that good things don‚Äôt stay good for long. I mean, just look at the rise and fall of Blockbuster. 

But hey, I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself. ",1,1739849495.0,writers,1,1.0,False

1is38ow,https://www.reddit.com/r/squidgame/comments/1is38ow/character_analysis_on_the_recruiter_a_study_of/,Character analysis on the Recruiter: A study of extremes,"To preface, I seldom get celebrity crushes. But this man has me in a chokehold since I saw S2E1 and hasn‚Äôt let go since. As this is very rare for me, I decided to do an analysis on why I found the Recruiter such an interesting character despite being in just one episode, and hope some of you might enjoy reading it. Gong Yoo‚Äôs performance truly deserves an Emmy.  
  
**Is it just good looks?**  
  
I have been seeing some posts that the Recruiter became viral mainly/only because the actor is handsome. While I agree that Gong Yoo‚Äôs looks did help, I think the character himself is very difficult to pull off convincingly. Stomping on bread in front of the homeless, displaying the now iconic deranged look during Russian Roulette- if he underacted he would have come across as underwhelming and bland. If he overacted- the character would easily have become cringe. I don‚Äôt think a highly attractive but mediocre actor would have had the same impact Gong Yoo did. Simply put, a bad but attractive actor would have ruined the salesman role more than a good but average-looking actor. The fact that Gong Yoo had acting chops, good looks and insane charisma made everything perfect.

**The Recruiter as an extreme character**

To me, what makes the Recruiter so interesting is that he is an extreme character. There are no ‚Äúin-betweens‚Äù in his personality which oscillates between the friendly, well-dressed Recruiter and the deranged psychopath who engages in extreme behaviour. As mentioned above, I think this is very difficult to pull off convincingly. But despite having such extremes in his personality, the Recruiter never comes across as unbelievable or flat in his scenes. This is because Gong Yoo manages to inject a lot of nuances in his performance. He conveys so many contradictory behaviours believably- he has to be charming, polite, insane, intimidating, comical, scary, afraid all within 30 minutes of screentime. ¬†

**The Recruiter is a unique villain**

While the Recruiter is definitely evil, his evil, interestingly, is not self-serving. He actually plays fairly by the rules, and believes he is doing a service to society by cleaning out the ‚Äútrash‚Äù. Most villains are selfish; they do evil things simply because they want to and do not feel the need to justify their actions. So why was there a need for the Recruiter to have his worldview validated as per the bread and lottery scene? I know the scene also serves as a social commentary on how most people would choose a slim chance at wealth over a small but confirmed benefit.

But in context of the Recruiter‚Äôs character, I found it fascinating he had to play that kind of game for himself. There is no tangible benefit (in fact, he operates at a loss), therefore we assume the benefit to him is psychological. My take on this is that the Recruiter knows, deep down, that what he is doing is evil. But he cannot break free from it because it is a system that he benefitted from. Given what we know of the young recruited soldiers, Gong Yoo‚Äôs character was likely poor and homeless as well in the past. But unlike Gi-hun who chooses to fight back despite benefitting from the system, the Recruiter chooses to perpetuate it. Therefore, he needs to constantly dehumanize his victims, proving to himself that the people he recruits into the games are trash. I think he took belief in the Games to such an extreme degree (culminating in his suicide) as overcompensation for his own doubts. 

Note: I am not sympathizing with the Recruiter. He is straight up evil. BUT I feel that this additional nuance made him a much more dimensional villain. I really wish the director would do a Recruiter spin-off, so that I can see Gong Yoo portray the kind of emotional conflict and horror for the Recruiter to become the person he was.

**Although we know the Recruiter is probably also a victim of the Games, the show does not try to make him sympathetic. He is irredeemable, fully committed to the Games‚Äô ideology.**

The Recruiter‚Äôs extreme behaviour continues in the first Russian Roulette scene. He speaks politely, with a warm and friendly smile, while forcing the loansharks to play a deadly game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Minus One. And this is where we know he is completely irredeemable despite his above need for validation. Although he was cruel in the bread and lottery activity, it was still benign- no one got hurt. Here, the insanity lurking behind his mask slips out even more when he pulls the trigger of the gun at his head and whistles.

Aside from that scene being incredibly hot, I remember there was a lot of discussion previously on whether the bullets were real or dummies. Given how extreme the Recruiter is, I believe he actually took the risk. He plays fair. And he does seem to have megalomania- he is brave to the point of recklessness and takes very risky behaviour (especially in the final scene with Gi-hun). This shows how living in the Games distort the value of life. The Recruiter treats life (including his own) callously. It seemed to me that this was how the Recruiter had lived and treated his life- recklessly, and yet he always won, and so believed he was ‚Äúspecial‚Äù and not trash. ¬†

I especially like the way his eyes dart between the loansharks at the very start of the game- he is taking pleasure from their fear. He also gags them with dogbone gags to further dehumanize and humiliate them. And when he shoots Mr. Kim without any hesitation, it is clear that any redeemable trait he might have had in the past is long gone; behind the friendly and warm persona, he is a microcosm for the Games. He is insane, unpredictable and dangerous.

**The Recruiter as a foil to Gi-hun**

And finally, we come to the showdown between him and Gi-hun. You know it‚Äôs a great scene when it‚Äôs able to command attention and tension despite the viewer knowing the outcome. I love the juxtaposition of their reflections in the two different mirrors. Gihun is reflected in a fragmented mirror, a visual representation of his brokenness after the Games. Whereas the Recruiter‚Äôs reflection is in a smooth, gilded mirror, a visual representation of his embrace of the Games‚Äô philosophy. On the surface, it seems that the two could not be more different. Gihun states that the Recruiter is simply an underling, a dog, and would not understand what he wishes to say to the Front Man. The Recruiter, offended that someone he deems inferior has insulted him, argues that he had been through far more to get to where he was now.

Then, there comes a moment where there might have been a shared understanding between them. It is subtle, but you can hear a sad musical note start playing when the Recruiter mentions he was given a gun, and that his existence was acknowledged for the first time in his life. This note continues all the way until Gihun presses his forehead against the Recruiter‚Äôs gun. Even though their behaviours and dialogues are antagonistic, I feel that this connecting music between them was deliberate. It indicates that both of them are victims, and that there is actually commonality between them in terms of the trauma that they had to endure in the system. Look at how flippantly they treat their lives- Gihun did not flinch at all when the Recruiter pointed the gun at his head, and it is the Recruiter who proposes the Russian Roulette game. A normal person would never agree to play such a deadly game. But to the two of them, it is nothing new. Contact with the Games has irrevocably changed them. As visually represented by the set, they are still in the world of the Games. What better way to resolve who is right but by a simple game?

I found it very interesting that both the Recruiter and Gi-hun did not cheat in the game. This kind of fair play is unique for a villain- it is rare that a villain would be so principled to his own permanent detriment. To me, this shows how broken and extreme the Recruiter is. He is evil, but he probably did not start out that way. To function and do the evil things he did, he had to constantly justify it to himself. And when face to face with the ultimate decision (death or acknowledgment he is a dog/trash by the rules of the game), he would rather die. It is this scene where the Recruiter is the most unhinged, and Gong Yoo‚Äôs nuanced acting simply shines through. I firmly believe a lesser actor would NOT have been able to pull off this scene. I honestly think Gong Yoo overshadowed Lee Jung Jae (already a great actor) in this scene. The ending shot of Gong Yoo‚Äôs dual expressions give a visual glimpse to his brokenness- the side showing his very human fear indicates to me, that perhaps, if he had not been brought into the Games at a young age and corrupted, he might have been a normal man.

**It's just Gong Yoo**

Aside from the overall excellent characterization, I was very impressed with Gong Yoo‚Äôs acting. I decided to check out his filmography and‚Ä¶ it was a mistake. This man‚Äôs charisma is crazy. I don‚Äôt think he is the most attractive actor, but he became extremely attractive to me simply by the way he moves and acts. He has the most expressive eyes, and the way he can convey love, longing, anguish, heartbreak simply through his eyes is amazing. I have watched all the commonly recommended ones (e.g. Train to Busan, Silenced, Goblin), but please DO NOT sleep on ‚ÄúA Man and a Woman‚Äù (explicit intimate scenes) and ‚ÄúCoffee Prince‚Äù. He is so good in those shows as well. Even my husband, who never watches Korean dramas, sat and watched his shows together with me. He is so believable and natural in his roles, which is why I feel his performance as the Recruiter made such a huge impact.

Also on a side note, Gong Yoo IRL seems to be very playful and competitive when it comes to games. Watch the youtube video ‚ÄúCast of the Silent Sea play Jenga‚Äù. GY was mischievous and playful with his co-actors, super serious at his turn, and his manic gremlin face when the Jenga tower fell was priceless. It‚Äôs such a pity he didn‚Äôt join the rest of the Squid Game cast in the promos where they played games, his energy and competitiveness would have been hilarious.

I really hope this post doesn‚Äôt come off as ableist. I have absolutely nothing against people with disabilities.

I (19f) started university in September. A guy (19m) from the accommodation snapchat group chat I joined before moving in began messaging me pretty quickly after I joined, I assumed it was some thirsty guy trying to get girls in the accom. Whatever. We message back and forth, very dryly in fact not really talking, just ‚Äòdry-snapping‚Äô.

After moving in, 3-4 nights a week he was texting asking whether I wanted to go out on a night out with him, or if I wanted to meet him outside for a cigarette. I declined for a while, because most of the time I was with other people, but one night about a month in I was on my own and feeling pretty down so when he asked if I wanted to join him for a smoke at 4am I obliged. He told me he had just come back from a night out so he was pretty drunk.

We met outside and talked for about half an hour! He was very lovely, we talked about our struggles with depression and OCD, I found out he has ADHD and we talked about that for a while. He told me he skateboarded and I thought that was awesome. All around, really lovely guy, but I wasn‚Äôt really attracted to him- although we had similar struggles and he was physically good looking we didn‚Äôt quite have the same sense of humour nor music taste which are big things for me. He was being very flattering, saying he could tell I was cute from my snapchats and that I had cool style. He is being a bit touchy feely but I ignore it. I notice he is slurring his words a bit but I assume that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs drunk (I am so so sorry if that is offensive it is just genuinely what I assumed given the context) and when we got up to go back to our respective rooms he was limping‚Äî which I put up to the same thing. He asks if I wanna go up to his room with him but I decline and say I‚Äôm tired (and I really didn‚Äôt want him to make a move on me) so I go back to my own room.

The next time we meet is on a night out, a week or two later? I‚Äôm out with my friend, he‚Äôs been out with his friends. A couple hours into our night out we meet up because the initial plan began as me accepting his invitation to a night out, however I had told my friend to come out with me first because I was worried about meeting this guy I barely know out clubbing. We‚Äôre all clubbing and talking and having fun. He is again being very flattering towards me. I ended up getting McDonald‚Äôs and going home with him in an Uber and he invited me to go upstairs to his room with him to eat, which we did and I end up sleeping next to him and nothing sexual happens.

I wake up and he‚Äôs already awake and making coffee. I realised that he has a limp and is speaking similarly to how he was and I realised that he has cerebral palsy. I didn‚Äôt really think much of it at the time. We chatted, had breakfast then I went back to my room.

A week later I go with my flatmate and her friends from her course to a pub quiz and I‚Äôm assuming we‚Äôre clubbing afterwards because it was Halloween. When we‚Äôre done with the pub quiz though, turns out they‚Äôre NOT clubbing and they‚Äôre going back to one of their accommodations to do a movie night and that I could join if I wanted. This probably sounds bitchy but I was in the mood for clubbing, I had my costume picked out, and i felt a lil awkward going back to one of their accommodations because they all knew eachother well but not me so I politely declined and told them I planned to go clubbing tonight, and I just started texting all friends asking who was going out. Turns out only this guy was in the mood for clubbing at the time and he was just about to go out with his friends and said he could meet me outside the pub to go out, so I thought what the hell sure and I did that.

We go clubbing, get hammered and when the night is over I go back to his with him and we have sex. This was a really bad mistake, and it is admittedly my fault because I should have known by how flattering he was being that he was into me in more than just a sexual way.

When we wake up, we‚Äôre having general convo about the night out, his friends etc. and then we get on to the topic of sex. He starts being very flattering to me again, and that every time he has had sex with a girl she has ghosted him afterwards and that it has fucked with his emotions in the past, but that I seem like I have a nice personality and that I‚Äôm chill and won‚Äôt do that. And he‚Äôs right, I would not ghost someone I‚Äôd just had sex with unless I hadn‚Äôt consented, which has happened to me before. I give him a hug and I tell him I‚Äôm sorry that happened to him, but I make sure to tell him I‚Äôm not into the idea of a romantic relationship at the moment and that I am just enjoying freedom at the moment. He says oh ok and he laughs about how he‚Äôs jealous about other guys I get to sleep with and I laugh with him because he seems in relatively good spirits about it although the whole time I‚Äôm very apologetic, even though he isn‚Äôt explicitly saying he wants a relationship with me. I go back to my room. 

Enter the two-week long onslaught of text messages from him asking ‚Äòdo you wanna date me?‚Äô ‚ÄòWhy would you that stuff with me if you don‚Äôt want to date me?‚Äô with me finding every possible way to gently tell him no, with the penultimate time being a straight up no, I‚Äôve told you no and why a few (many) times, I‚Äôd rather we just be friends or if that is too much perhaps we shouldn‚Äôt speak for a while or at all‚Äîwords to that effect. The latter question I assumed to be about sex, and I didn‚Äôt expect because we had identical body counts (hate that term, but) and hadn‚Äôt dated anyone between us. Of course I profusely apologised and told him I didn‚Äôt realise that what we did wasn‚Äôt just casual sex for him and I felt genuinely awful that I had led this poor guy on because I was too stupid to close my legs because I‚Äôm a slut lol. Because of his OCD, he is constantly apologising and saying sorry, which he explained to me is the obsession that he does everything wrong or that he is fundamentally flawed and the compulsion to say sorry because of it, which is why I reassure him and tell him he hasn‚Äôt done a thing wrong for me to not date him, I just don‚Äôt feel ready for a relationship and don‚Äôt think we gel in that way. I assumed the constant asking was some sort of checking compulsion but now I don‚Äôt know if he just genuinely didn‚Äôt understand that i didn‚Äôt want to date him even though I had told him so many times I didn‚Äôt want to.

Eventually, he stops asking for a while. Some time in December he asks if I want to go to this Christmas fair that had popped up in our city for the wintertime and I oblige because I hadn‚Äôt been and I wanted to go. We planned it for a bit, which evening we would go and talked about how were excited to get Christmas fair food, and towards the end of the conversation he says ‚Äòso it‚Äôs a date?‚Äô

I should have just shut him down right there and I don‚Äôt know why I didnt. I think it was a combination of the fact he kept asking to date, then when I‚Äôd shut him down he‚Äôd apologise that he wasn‚Äôt good enough and I‚Äôd console him and tell him it‚Äôs nothing he‚Äôs done wrong, and I didn‚Äôt want to undo all the planning we just did and excitement we geared up that eventually I was just like ‚Äòi guess so!‚Äô. I thought, ok one date, this is fine I can just do this to show I‚Äôve tried because I didn‚Äôt want him to overthink the rejections more than he already was and I had at this point convinced myself that I should be into him, even though we just didn‚Äôt gel on a personal level, so I decided I‚Äôll go on this ‚Äòdate‚Äô. BAD IDEA.

To him, one date meant we were ‚Äòdating‚Äô. I found this out when we went home after this evening out and he cupped my cheeks and said ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm dating such an incredible woman‚Äô. Shit. What have I done. I should have just corrected him then and there but I didn‚Äôt because I‚Äôm a coward. I couldn‚Äôt reject him again, not to his face, not to this man who has been so lovely to me and had it so bad in the past. I got it in my head that I was ableist and a horrible person for not being attracted to him even though our personality and music taste didn‚Äôt match up which is something I found out more as I hung out with him more. 

He told all his friends, his parents, his sister about me and I told no one. We hung out a lot, I went to his almost every day and we would go out to buy midnight snacks and wine every other day and that was really fun, but I just did not love him. I had to keep it up for long enough that wouldn‚Äôt make him feel bad which ended up being around two weeks because I couldn‚Äôt live with myself keeping it up when I knew I didn‚Äôt love him.  We went on another date, a double date with a couple he‚Äôs friends with, and again it was fun and they were absolutely lovely too but I just was not into this guy unfortunately, not more than friends. I was confiding in one of my female flatmates about a week in though, because I couldn‚Äôt keep it in and I asked for advice after breaking down my situation because I was waking up and going to bed each night feeling emotionally trapped, however I didn‚Äôt tell her he has cerebral palsy because I didn‚Äôt want her to think that I had used this guy for sex and then was gonna dump him because he had cerebral palsy, which is literally not the reason at all like I‚Äôve told her and every one of my friends since her it is because we don‚Äôt really get on as well as HE thinks we do, we don‚Äôt really have the same sense of humour and our personalities don‚Äôt match and that‚Äôs the honest truth but I felt like if I told them he had cerebral palsy they would attribute it to that, which is what I‚Äôve gotten in my head that I‚Äôve done and it‚Äôs what I feel like I‚Äôve done, even though it doesn‚Äôt make sense because why would I trap myself in a situation wherein the person I share a monogamous relationship with I had little attraction or affection for when I could just, like, get with someone I had more attraction to? I still feel like I‚Äôve used him although I only had sex with him two more times during this dating period. 

When I broke things off, I did it over the phone because I didn‚Äôt want to text, that would be shitty, but I felt like I couldn‚Äôt meet him in person just to let him down either. Again, he was really relaxed about it at first, literally just an ‚Äòoh ok‚Äô, and then cue another two week string of text messages of him apologising for not being good enough and asking why he‚Äôs not good enough for me and this and that. I feel like I should mention things moved very fast in those two weeks and he was telling me I could come home with him to spend Christmas with his family and he even suggested we go to Amsterdam together soon now that tickets were cheap because I mentioned offhand once I‚Äôd like to go there. It was a very stressful experience but I had literally consented to it so I can‚Äôt really be that upset about it.

His cerebral palsy is the detail I‚Äôve omitted when telling my friends after this has happened and I feel so guilty that I did that and I don‚Äôt know if I should tell them that he has cerebral palsy because mentioning it randomly is going to sound like im ableist. I just feel like such a shit person, and such a slut too. I still snap this guy now and again because I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äòghost‚Äô him, though on my part it‚Äôs every couple days and very dry because I don‚Äôt want him to get attached again. He sent me a snap a couple weeks ago of him in bed with a girl and I didn‚Äôt really know what to make of that. I have hung out with him once a couple weeks after I broke things off with him but I have decided not to again in case he perceives us hanging out as more than it really is: hanging out. 

I feel so bad but there‚Äôs not really anything else I can say to the guy but I feel so bad for not telling my friends he has cerebral palsy even though it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with why he acted the way he did, at least to my knowledge of the condition, I just feared they would assume it was the reason I was reluctant to date him. Honestly my biggest worry though was that if I told them there would be the case where they think cerebral palsy affects his ability to consent or anything like that, which is silly because he‚Äôs literally just a regularly functioning human being just with a slight physical disability but now that‚Äôs something my brain is harping on and I feel so guilty because what if cerebral palsy really does affect his ability to consent to sex and his constant asking and apologising was more than just his OCD even though I know he has OCD and it makes him do things like that I start to worry maybe he just truly doesn‚Äôt understand, and even saying that makes me sound ableist I‚Äôm just really fucking angry at myself and I feel like the most horrible person in the world and I just had to get it off my chest. Feel free to tell me to kill myself lol I am very open to that! This has been on my mind non stop for two months. Sorry for the long ass rant.",2,1739848987.0,confessions,7,0.6,False

Lamination is multiple pieces of wood glued together, that's it. The spectrum of a laminated piece of wood on a guitar ranges from two pieces of the highest grade of wood on a $20,000 custom built guitar to two sheets of paper thin tone wood sandwiching particle board. I think Taylor laminates the B&S of the 100 and 200 series with a strip of Poplar in the middle. There are a bunch of people at bars and coffee houses killing it  with one of these this very minute... It's in the fingers.

Lamination can save material cost for sure on cheap guitars for sure. It also stabilizes the wood. They help hold each other together at times of stress. It doesn't move as much in times of heat and humidity changes. If you want a guitar and not a pet you have to tend to every other day, a high quality laminated guitar is a better choice.

K Yiari made his guitars ""laminated"". It wasn't until the market demanded ""all solid"" that they started making them. When I installed a pickup in my 83 YW 600, The drill popped out the wedge inlay (center back decorative piece  with strap button in the middle), with a flashlight a couldn't find a seam or layers. just two sheets glued together to provide stability and strength. Nobody would do that now and it's a shame. It had to cost him money to do it that way, but it made for instruments that didn't crack if you went on winter vacation.

Any and all feedback is welcomed!



(Prologue)

In the beginning, there was nothing. And I don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúnothing‚Äù in the poetic, deep, pseudo philosophical way people use when they try to sound smarter than they are. I mean *actual* nothing. No space, no time, no sound, no void to scream into just absolute zip, nada, a whole lotta squat. I know it doesn‚Äôt make sense, but what does? Nothing makes sense. Like why some people microwave their leftover pizza instead of using an oven. Anyway, I‚Äôm getting off track here. Let‚Äôs try this again, okay?

(Chapter 1)

On the edge of the universe, there was a planet a real dump of a planet, honestly. And on the edge of one of its shittiest towns, you could find me. Not sipping a drink at some dive bar or laying low in a motel, no. I was in a cage. I wish I could tell you this was the weirdest situation I‚Äôd ever been in. Last week, I spent forty-eight hours locked inside a fridge don‚Äôt ask, that‚Äôs another story. But you're probably wondering how I ended up here, aren't you? Well, buckle up, because this one‚Äôs a doozy. 

So... Where to begin? Guess we gotta hit the big *beginning* the *Beginning* beginning. 

You know, before the stars, planets, and overpriced iced coffee, there was just... nothing. The same kind of nothing I was talking about earlier no rules, no meaning, just pure uncut absence. If you‚Äôre having a hard time wrapping your head around that, join the club. It‚Äôs like trying to imagine a world where people don‚Äôt hit reply-all on emails. It just doesn‚Äôt compute. But, in one climactic moment, everything exploded into existence: time, space, matter, that annoying song your coworker hums every day all of it, just *poof.* And from this glorious mess came the universe. 

And with the universe came *Dad.*

Dad well, you might know him as God, but around here we call him Dad wasn‚Äôt really what you‚Äôd call a ""details guy."" He liked the big picture. The grand scheme of things. The cosmic vision board. But after a few billion years of stirring galaxies and hurling comets through space, even the divine gets bored. So Dad decided to retire and settle down in a cozy little corner of the cosmos. Found a gas cloud that would eventually turn into our solar system, gave it a nod, and said, ‚ÄúYeah, this‚Äôll do.‚Äù 

For reasons beyond my comprehension seriously, *why* he fixated on this backwater rock we call Earth. Honestly, Mars would‚Äôve been the better choice. Nice scenery, plenty of room for a patio. But Dad isn‚Äôt known for his taste in real estate. Every now and then, he‚Äôd throw a space rock full of random chemicals at the planet just to see what stuck. And somehow, after a few billion years of trial and error, oceans appeared, continents rose, and *life* clawed its way out of the muck.  

Then Dad got an idea. See, he didn‚Äôt want to micromanage this dirtball forever. So, he made something a successor, someone to eventually take over the cosmic throne and govern the universe. Big shoes to fill, right? But in the meantime, Dad gave the new guy a trial run on Earth. ""Figure out life, manage some creatures, create stuff,"" he said, like it was a casual summer internship. And this guy, well‚Ä¶ let's just say he got real ambitious with it. Mountains, rivers, trees, animals the works. 

He sculpted the first land-based life, and for a while, things were looking pretty good. But if there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned about this universe, it‚Äôs that good things don‚Äôt stay good for long. I mean, just look at the rise and fall of Blockbuster.

## Key Features to‚Å¢ Consider When Buying a Portable Power Bank with AC Outlet

Choosing the‚Å¢ right **portable power‚Äã bank ‚Å¢ac outlet** requires careful consideration of several key features. Here's a breakdown ‚Å§of‚Å¢ what ‚Å¢to ‚Äålook for:

*   ‚Å¢**Capacity (mAh/Wh):** This determines how much power ‚Å£the bank can‚Å§ store and how many charges it ‚Äçcan provide. Higher capacity means more charges, especially for larger devices like laptops.
*   **AC‚Äã Output Power (watts):** This indicates the maximum wattage the ‚Å§AC outlet can ‚Å£deliver. Ensure it's sufficient for the‚Äå devices you plan ‚Å§to power. Check your device's power adapter ‚Äçto find its wattage‚Å¢ requirements.
*   **USB Ports:** Look for multiple USB ports,‚Å§ including‚Å¢ USB-A ‚Äçand‚Å£ USB-C ports, to charge smartphones, tablets, and other ‚ÄåUSB-powered devices together.
*   ‚Å¢**Power Delivery (PD):** A ‚Å£**power delivery (PD) power bank ac outlet** offers faster charging speeds for compatible devices. Look for ‚Äçmodels with high PD output (e.g., ‚Å¢60W‚Å§ or higher) for‚Äå rapid ‚Äãcharging ‚Äçof laptops and other‚Äå power-hungry devices.
*   **Safety Features:** ‚ÄçOver-voltage protection, over-current protection, short-circuit protection, and ‚Äçtemperature control are‚Äç essential safety features to protect your ‚Å§devices and the power bank itself.
*‚Å£   **Size and‚Å£ Weight:** Portability is‚Äç key, ‚Å¢so consider the ‚Äçsize and weight of the power bank, especially if you plan to carry it in your backpack or luggage.
*   **Durability:** If ‚Äåyou plan to use ‚Äçthe power bank outdoors, look for models with rugged designs, water‚Å£ resistance, and drop protection.
*   **Display Screen:** A clear display screen that shows ‚Äçthe battery level, ‚Å¢output voltage, and other useful data can ‚Äçbe very helpful.
*   **Inverter ‚Å§Type:** ‚Å¢Some‚Å¢ **inverter power bank** devices‚Å£ use modified sinewave inverters and‚Å£ some use ‚Äãpure **sinewave ac power bank** ‚Äçinverters. Pure sinewave are better for ‚Å£sensitive ‚Äçelectronics.

## Power Station vs. Power Bank: what's the Difference?

The terms ""power station""‚Å§ and‚Å¢ ""power bank"" are often used interchangeably, but there are key differences between ‚Å¢the two. Power stations‚Å£ are generally larger, heavier,‚Å¢ and more powerful than ‚Å§power banks. They often have a ‚Äåwider‚Å£ range of output options,including AC‚Å§ outlets,DC ports,and ‚ÄãUSB ports. They have a ‚Å¢larger battery capacity. They are also often equipped with features like solar ‚Å£charging capability, display screens, and built-in inverters.

Power banks, conversely, are more compact and portable. They‚Äå typically have a‚Äã smaller battery capacity and fewer output ‚Å§options, mainly focusing on USB charging ‚Å£and AC output intended for smaller devices.

Consider your‚Äç power ‚Äåneeds ‚Å§and usage scenarios to‚Å£ guide your decision. Power stations provide more power, but power banks offer unbeatable portability.

I also am considering teaching because at least that's something and I do like teaching highschool kids (I have volunteered as a teachers aid). I have really bad brain fog since like 2023 started and at this point I don't know what to do. I do not have the time to study and take the LSAT again (I had to drop courses because of family emergencies last year and am rushing to complete my majors). My parents say not to worry about the costs of anything, and are trying to get me to do one of those 700$ LSAT courses (in the same breath also tell me we don't have money for coffee powder).

I don't know what to pursue and need someone to tell me what to do.

Please don't ask what I want to do most; I have interest in both but do not think I have a passion for anything - not just academic but like in life at all. If I really had a choice I mean I don't really even wanna be here if you catch my drift; but obviously a taboo sentiment and not easily achievable and against my religion so I have to pick a career haha.

About a week in, I'm sitting at my leads desk. I'm broke as fuck, can't afford lunch, so I see a twisted off wrapper with five Ritz crackers in it. It's sitting on the desk and it's been there for days. I snag it up and eat them... Whenever so-and-so comes back, I tell him, ""I ate your crackers, I was really hungry and I'm sorry..."" ü•∫

Fast forward a couple weeks...

Valentine's Day, I cut the piss out of my finger, so I go at his desk and I'm fishing around for Band-Aids... I find one and I'm trying to put it on my finger, and his wife who also works there walks in and sees me at her husband's desk digging around for Band-Aids...
Later that day, he has Valentine's candy, so I asked him for a piece...
It was a kit Kat teddy bear... It was about the only thing I got for Valentine's Day.

Today I come in....
He has labels ""property of so-and-so"" all over everything, the cabinet, the desk, the computer, etc..... I asked so-and-so if I can still use the walkie, and the walkie charger..... he yells at me with his arms flailing in the air saying ""Take it!! Take it!!"" Unplugs the walkie charger and hands it to me and walks off....

Later, the boss came in and pulled me into the office... And asked me if those were my keys and coffee mug sitting on so-and so's desk..
I said ""yes.."" 

She grabbed them up, and said ""come with me"".
She took me to a room off to the side with a desk and a trash can, set my keys in my mug on the desk and said that that was my area now and that she hated having this conversation with me but..
 That she would get me a computer all my own, and that I could put whatever I wanted to on the desk and the walls... 

""so-and-so is being very petty and very territorial about his space... I think this is ridiculous and I'm sorry.""

"" Oh.... Well okay then... Thank you... ""

I drove home all the way just letting it get under my skin.... 


I got home, grabbed a new pack of Ritz crackers out of my cabinet, took five of them out, put them in a snack Ziploc baggie, and put them in a small gift bag. 

I couldn't find a kit Kat teddy bear, so I bought a twix Easter egg instead... And also put it in the gift bag. 

I pulled out one of my sympathy cards. On the inside I wrote... 

""Thank you for being so kind and generous after my husband's passing."" 

I put two Band-Aids in the card. Put it in the envelope. And wrote his last name on it.

At first, they didn‚Äôt know i was able to drive but they found out when i mentioned i commute by driving and after, I started offering to drive them around from time to time to St. George campus when we needed to go or to eat out (places like wingstop or andreas cookies) and drive them to malls or coffee shops so we could chill and study somewhere else like at a coffee shop we liked if I felt like it and had the time to do so. 

But at a certain point, my friends began to ask me to drive them everywhere and help them go places to run their OWN errands since they don‚Äôt feel like bussing around and at this point it only feels like they want to hang out just so I can give them ‚Äúrides‚Äù to and from home. It started to piss me off how often they ask me to do so without compensating for it (such as offering to buy gas or even a damn iced Capp I‚Äôll even acceptüò≠) either even tho they asked me and I didn‚Äôt offer or initiate the idea. 

Tuesday morning, I was really stressed bc of my midterms and snapped at one of my friends who asked me for a ride to UTM campus from her house; btw i live closer to the UTM campus and her house is nowhere near my house or the UTM campus. I told her the rides aren‚Äôt free and how inconsiderate she is during this time (I had midterms back to back that day, she was aware I had midterms), asking me without considering how this may be rude or inappropriate‚Äîknowing damn well she‚Äôs not offering to pay for gas and i really didn‚Äôt have the time to go halfway across the city to pick her up. I did feel bad on how I approached the situation, but my stress and emotions got in the way. 

My friend saw the message and hasn‚Äôt responded to me since Tuesday evening, and my other friends have been super dry after this incident. What did i do to make them mad??

I thought everyone had them too. Like a little imp living inside one‚Äôs head, thriving on one mischievous idea after another.


‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not study today and head out to play!‚Äù He often seemed innocent or harmless enough though it started taking a more nefarious turn at times. ‚ÄúJust ignore Mum and Dad. What do they know anyway?‚Äù


Some called it a battle between good and evil in my head. An angel and a demon trying to convince me to their cause. Except that it was only one side speaking all the time. Was I supposed to be the angel?


I never thought I needed help till I was in my late teens. ‚ÄúBash his face in! He insulted you, you‚Äôre going to be pussy about this?‚Äù Thankfully my friends managed to drag me off him in time.


Frankly, I don‚Äôt think the counsellors or the psychiatrist ever really understood what was going on. How could they? To them, I was a just another rebellious teenager with anger management issues. How was I to explain that there were times the voice grew so loud in my own head it seemed to bump me out of the cockpit and take over? He knew everything about me, my weaknesses and my insecurities and he knew what made me tick.


I think I finally manage to get a handle on things after getting into meditation and the like, focusing on emptying my mind. Thankfully it did help, or yours truly would have been writing this from inside a psychiatric ward while on - a long term stay. 


The voice did return with a vengeance while I was in college. Staying in a dorm room by myself with raging hormones didn‚Äôt help a single bit. ‚ÄúAh she seems passed out. You know you want it! Who would know anyway?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh please, just tell her she was all over you in the morning!‚Äù


You know, it was a miracle I even graduated with honours with all the pills and drugs I took to keep him at bay in my head. The meditation and focused thoughts could only keep him quiet for so long.


He seemed to have mellowed down once I started work. Perhaps he decided to give poor old me a break for once. I don‚Äôt think I could have even functioned with him around in full force and even hold a job. Yet he was never gone, always lurking in the background and never hesitating to remind me he was there. ‚ÄúOh just a push! Everyone will think he fell on his own onto the tracks.‚Äù


Things were beginning to look up. I had a girlfriend. I no longer had thoughts about ending it all, myself along with this monster inside my head. My memory is a little hazy but there were days when he uttered no more than a sentence or two.


One fine morning, I woke up after what was a long week at work. The sun seemed exceptionally brighter than usual and somehow, my head never felt as peaceful as it did today. Something was different but I couldn‚Äôt quite put a finger to it.


As I got to make my morning coffee, I could see a figure in the corner of my eye moving towards the door. Its familiar voice was as clear as it ever was.


‚ÄúGoodbye Andrew.‚Äù Startled, I turned and there it was, a spitting image of me staring right back with a smirk on its face. 


‚ÄúI have no use for you anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúSchemers?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are they scheming?‚Äù one person pondered on an Upper West Side Facebook group, while someone on the social media platform X jokingly wrote, ‚ÄúGoing here to do some scheming.‚Äù

I will educate you about plasma. Thank you!

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation

Mostly like mixing my espresso with milk for cold/hot lattes, but I also enjoy the straight espresso if its a good bean. Need something I can use every morning, a few times a day. I don't have any space constraints, and I actually like the look of some of the larger machines (though it's not something that would really influence my decision). I'm absolutely brand new to making coffee/espresso, though I do have a fairly experienced palate. I do prefer electric, but I'm open to whatever would be a good starting point given how I'll use my machine.

Current espresso machine: 

* Chefman Crema Supreme
   * Haven't really used it - bought it on a whim before I did the research. Likely returning it as I would like something a little higher build quality

Options I'm considering:

* Gaggia Classic Evo Pro \[$490\]
* Gemilai OWL G3006 \[$400\]
* Rancilio Silvia E Model V6 2020 \[$900\]
   * I've heard amazing things, but it's a little over my price range. Though I'm considering it.
* Breville Barista Express \[$700\]

  
Open to other options, and would love to know what others think about the ones I'm considering. Also open to machines without the grinder, though it would be nice if both machine/grinder is somewhere around my price range. ",1,1739847834.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Here is a report from an agent of P&O who sailed on the American Liner SS St. Louis (1894) and the Canadian Pacific liner SS Empress of India (1890) in order to take notes on his employer's competition. His observations are both fascinating and remarkably detailed. 

*I have the honor to report my arrival here yesterday. The following details of the steamers in which I have traveled may interest you.*

***S.S. St Louis***

*Left Southampton on 20th September, called at Cherbourg the same evening and embarked about thirty cabin and nearly a hundred steerage passengers, her total passenger list being:*  
*1st Class--362 adults, 5 children*  
*2d Class--156 adults, 8 children*  
*Steerage--477 in all.*

*The ship has 351 berths 1st Class, 206 berths 2d class and is licensed to carry 649 persons in the steerage. The crew consists of 6 officers, 8 quarter masters, 43 deck hands, 30 Engineers Etc. 66 firemen, 21 oilmen, 48 stokers, and 125 in the purser's department. The ship's daily runs were respectively 300, 406, 398, 437,431,400, 444, and 236 miles. Arrived at New York on Sunday, 28th September, at 9 a.m.*

*Cabins: of the 170 staterooms, 1st Class, no less than 88 are inner ones, but all are well ventilated by an airtrunk passing through with an opening in each cabin, the air begin exhausted in the usual way by fans. The majority of the cabins are four- berthed. On the promenade deck, there are 14 suites of bed-and-sitting rooms with bath and W.C. attached; the fares for these cabins vary, according to size and position from 80 to 115 pounds in the slack season and from 130 to 180 pounds in the full season.*

*(The 1904 dollar/pound exchange rate was five to the pound. Hence, cheapest first class fare on the St Louis in the off-season amounted to $400; for the period, quite pricey--Editor)*

*I was told by the purser that they are always in great demand. The outer 95 O cabins are generally small, the inner ones being more roomy; no door curtains to any of the cabins, so that the doors must be invariably kept closed, which in hot weather would be very trying. The cabins were poorly supplied with cloak hooks, no chests of drawers or whatnots, but a small wardrobe in each.*

*The bunks are old-fashioned wooden ones, with wooden bottom- boards provided with an air bed only, no mattress. These are most uncomfortable for, after a time, the weight of the body forces the air to the sides and feet and one is lying with nothing but the bed tick over the hard boards! The switch of the electric light is so placed that one is within easy reach of every bunk, so that a passenger can turn the light on or off without rising.*

*A notice is posted in each cabin that the company is not responsible for money or valuables unless deposited with the purser; this is the only notice of any kind in the ship.*

*Enameled plates are affixed to the bulkheads at the foot of each companion, and in the alleyways, with the cabin numbers and arrows point ing in the direction. This is a very convenient direction and looks better than the cardboard notices used in our vessels. Saloon is large and plainly decorated in white and gold. It seats 370 people, double meals are un known. !*

***Drink Consumption Enormous***

*Library, forward of saloon, furnished with six writing tables and comfortable lounges, well supplied with stationary. Smoking Room is very large. In the center there are tables with seats for four persons each, and settees all around, accommodating altogether 100 people with seats. The Bar is closed at 11 o'clock, lights extinguished at midnight. All transactions at the Smoking Room bar are in cash, the consumption of drinks enormous. Mineral waters are sup plied in ""splits"" as well as the ordinary sized bottles. Two stewards are always 95 S in attendance in the Smoking Room. The Saloon, Smoking Room and passageways were all heated with steam-pipes.*

*Passengers are not allowed to use their own deck chairs, a stock of common folding chairs is kept on board and can be hired at one dollar for the voyage.*

*Baths etc: all on spar deck against the stoke-hold bulkhead, none on the ship's side. There are 10 ladies WC's and 16 for gentlemen; only 8 bath rooms, which are used indiscriminately by either sex. They are excessively cramped, hot and cold water is laid on but no shower, spray of another adjunct. Fresh water is not obtainable in bathrooms.*

*Servants were of all nationalities, mostly German, Swiss and Irish,. At table, one waiter is allowed for six passengers, all wore a numbered badge. The attendance was not particularly smart; the men were all very civil, but frequently engaged in conversation with the people they were waiting on; this appeared not to be considered improper. There were 8 stewardess's on the ship, of whom 2 were specially to look after ladies on deck; taking meals on deck was a very common practice.*

*Baggage: The American Line have a very good arrangement with the London Parcels Delivery Company for collecting baggage and forward- ing to Southampton very similar to our own. The Baggage Master also attends at the railway station and takes delivery there of any package brought down by passengers the day previous to sailing. The ship (under American Law) is liable for loss or damage to baggage up to a limit of 20 pounds. All heavy packages and those not marked cabin are stowed in the hold, and cannot be got at on the voyage under any circumstances. (Weekly visit to the baggage room as the climate changed were a fixed routine on all P&O steamers of the period. Ed.) The trip being of such short duration there is no difficulty in passengers 96 O taking everything required in their cabin.*

*On arrival at New York, the Customs official came on board at the Quarantine Station, bringing declaration forms, which have to be filled in, signed, and sworn in their presence.*

*This is done before the vessel gets to the wharf. Immediately she is along side, the baggage is discharged into the sheds and sorted alphabetically (labels for the purpose are supplied with the passage ticket), every pack age has to be opened for examination, but the landing and examination is most expeditiously performed.*

*Messing: The meal hours are: Breakfast, 8-10 a.m.; Lunch 1 p.m.; Dinner, 7p.m.; Childrens' meals in the saloon an hour earlier. 2d class: Breakfast, 8:30 a.m.; dinner, 1 p.m.; Tea, 5 p.m.; Supper 9 p.m. At eleven o'clock each morning, trays of sandwiches are handed 'round. Sandwiches of various kinds are kept on a sideboard in the Smoking Room all day.*

*A lavish table was kept, the menus in the usual American style, a curious mixture of dishes. All meals were served a la carte. The cooking, as a rule, good. The quality of the provisions, good, the oilmen's stores etc supplied by well-known English firms, Crosse & Blackwell, Huntley & Palmer, Moir, etc. The meat was of best quality but on more than one occasion, had been cooked without being properly thawed. The bread was good, rolls and great variety of fancy breads excellent & pastry poor. Fruit plentifully supplied, but of poor quality and often unripe. Tea and coffee fair. Ice wastefully used at meals and all other times. I am sending (per dispatch box) copies of the daily menu cards for your Superintendent Purser's inspection. Glass finger bowls supplied. Second Class accommodations were nearly all four-berth ca bins, very plain and poorly furnished. Only three bathrooms. Seats at table for 200 persons. The officers's cabins were all on 96 O the bridge deck, they had a separate mess room and at no times mixed with the passengers. \^\^!*

***Empress of India***

*Left Vancouver 6th October, 4 p.m. Arrived Yokohama on 21st idem. at daylight. The passage was a stormy one throughout. The daily runs were: 259, 348, 349, 317, 256, 276, 281, 349, 378, 359, 192, 351, 258 miles respectively. The vessel has accommodations for 176 first, 24 second cabin and is licensed to carry 906 steerage. On this voyage, the passage list comprised: 1st Class--112 adults and 5 children 2d Class--7 adults and 4 children Steerage--698 in all.*

*The accommodation is very similar in style to your own vessels, there are but few inner cabins and those very roomy. The cabins are well furnished with wardrobe, drawers under the sofa berth, an ample supply of cloak-hooks and a flap table. The WC's and Baths are all inside, the latter large with hot and cold water laid on, also fresh water showers. PP!*

***Rude Plenty***

*The Dining Saloon, Library, Smoking Room and Alleyways all are heated with steam pipe. The Library is comfortably furnished with lounges, easy chairs and writing tables; there is a good supply of stationary, and a well-assorted collection of books for the use of which no charge is made.*

*The Head and Second Stewards, Chef, and Stewardess are Europeans, the remainder of the servants and galley staff are Chinese. The attendance, both at tables and in the cabins, was smart, intelligent and quietly performed.*

*A varied and lavish table was kept, the meat however (taken in at Vancouver) was coarse and there is, to my mind, too great a use of ""canned"" provisions. Bread excellent, pastry and sweets fair, tea and coffee good, fruit plentiful and of fair quality. On the whole, the messing may be summed up in the phrase ""rude plenty."" The passengers seemed well satisfied. 96 S*

*The Bar was closed at 11 p.m. Lights were extinguished in the Saloon and on Deck at that hour, and in the Smoking room at midnight. The latter was rather small and inconveniently arranged.*

*The Dining Saloon seats 182 persons. A table plan is posted in the companion the first day out, as soon the as the seats have been allotted. This was a most convenient arrangement, enabling passengers to identify the names of their fellow travelers. It might be adopted with advantage in our steamers.*

*Hours of Meals: Breakfast 8:30 a.m. ; Lunch 1 p.m.; Dinner, 7 p.m. Beef-tea and sandwiches were carried around at 11 a.m. and afternoon tea at 4 o'clock. Finger bowls used at each meal. Deck chairs supplied free.*

*Baggage not wanted in the cabins was placed in the baggage room situated on the main deck forward where it was easily accessible. This was opened on Wednesday and Saturday mornings for passengers to get out anything required. The space allotted for the baggage was large but there was apparently no system of sorting or stowing it for different ports separately. I was told that over- carriage of packages seldom occurs.*

*Both in this ship and on the Atlantic liner, there were several instances of ladies losing articles of jewelry which were not subsequently traced.*

*The 2d Class is of a distinctly inferior type, indeed it is in reality an intermediate or improved steerage for Europeans.*

*The ship's officers messed in the saloon, and passed a good deal of their time with the passengers.*

*Both the steamers carried a printer.*

*I am, gentlemen, your obedient servant,¬†signature illegible.*

    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Hi! I posted this same thing on the subreddit for Starbucks baristas, but I didn‚Äôt get any responses so I figured I‚Äôd try my luck here too. I completed training on Friday (yay!) and had my first day at my store today. I was mainly on warming and POS, and while I really enjoyed what I was doing, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel so clueless and slow. It would take me so long to do one thing that another partner would often have to step in and help me with my station. 

I know that the expectations weren‚Äôt that high since it was my first day, but I would love to hear any tips anyone has for me to help move the process along as smoothly as possible. I‚Äôm especially struggling with all the tasks of POS. At the store I trained at, there were virtually no Doordash orders coming through, but at this location it feels like they are constant, and remembering to take orders and brew the hot coffee and pack the orders is really difficult for me and I often end up forgetting something. Does anyone have like a system of sorts for themselves to help keep on top of all these tasks?

Thanks so much for your responses and help in advance! I might be worrying too much about everything because I tend to put a lot of pressure on myself, and I know that a lot of this will go easier with time. My SSV told me just to take things slow, so I need to work on doing that too even when times get really hectic. My biggest fear is just being in other partners‚Äô way or not pulling my weight, so I just wanna make sure I can avoid that as much as possible. Sorry if this is a loaded question, I just am really excited to have this job and want to make sure I‚Äôm doing the best I can!!

I spend a lot of time on the island visiting friends and the local coffee shops remember me and it‚Äôs so much more friendly and community oriented, and then I come back home and everyone‚Äôs just so closed off and there‚Äôs no connection or desire to connect with anyone. People are not as friendly here as they used to be and everyone‚Äôs just so absorbed in their own lives.

As I approach my 30‚Äôs there‚Äôs nothing more that I want then to live a slow quiet life in a small town but with the direction life is taking me right now it‚Äôll be a while yet until I can get there and for now I‚Äôm stuck here. 

I don‚Äôt feel like Langley has much to offer for people my age unless you‚Äôre into drinking which I‚Äôm trying to do less of. 

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone in feeling this way but I‚Äôm curious what everyone‚Äôs thoughts are, especially those in their mid-late 20‚Äôs and early 30‚Äôs. It‚Äôs definitely not somewhere I see raising my kids.",4,1739847529.0,Langley,37,0.67,False

1is2lx9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1is2lx9,Just found out about a group of Dutch volunteers who have been visiting Armenian villages regularly since 2019 to repair houses and their roofs üá≥üá±üß°,"A Dutch volunteer group that fundraises money in the Netherlands in order to go on volunteer missions to various countries also has been coming to Armenia since 2019. They primarily repair houses and their roofs belonging to villagers who live in provinces such as Lori. There are both very young people and older working professionals. Here's the link to the Facebook video by Azatutyun: https://fb.watch/xPHahYLqi5/?mibextid=wwXIfr (I'll link it in the comments since Reddit doesn't allow you to include more than one attachment). 

Some people came with their children, and one man even remarks that they don't want their children to grow up spoiled, so while they vacationed in France last year, they brought their children to Armenia this summer to help out with the repairs. Unfortunately, in the video, many of them mention the poor state of countryside living conditions construction regulations. One of them mentions how different those standards and regulations are in the Netherlands compared to Armenia, which was frankly embarrassing. 

One of the organizations in this volunteer group is named ""Daken voor Armeni√´,"" meaning ""Roofs for Armenia"" in Dutch. And for the younger people who can usually visit only in the summertime, and as mentioned in the video, they do yard sales, sell in vintage markets, and offer to do various tasks around the neighborhood to fundraise for the building materials. 

I follow all of their pages and updates and observe the hospitality the villagers show to them in exchange. They often get coffee, cut fruit, desserts, and of course, occasionally, the khorovats (bbq).

1is2lmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeTransfer/comments/1is2lmu/cant_decide_if_i_should_stay_at_my_school_or/,Can‚Äôt Decide if I Should Stay at My School or Transfer,"(Long post, I apologize.)

For context, I (19, F) am considering transferring for the Fall '25 or '26 semester.

I'm sure posts asking this question have been posted a million times, but I'm super conflicted and generally don't know what to do.

I'm in my freshman year at a big, well known, state school and I have absolutely no idea if it's right for me. The academics are fine, and I've already connected with one of my professors. My only issue is with the social scene. I have trouble fitting in here, and I usually feel ""othered"" by my peers. I've made efforts to combat this though, I'm in sports and a handful of clubs- but I still have only made 1-2 friends. The social scene- in terms of going out, nightlife- is great, but I usually can't engage with it.

I applied to this school on a whim following the success and popularity of one of their athletic programs (ironically I haven't been to a single game), due to the feeling that my parents were disappointed with the schools I had already been admitted into and wanted to attend, and due to the low cost of the school (it was lower than anything I would've attended in-state). The ""parental disappointment"" factor was the biggest deciding point though, especially since after the tour of my top school (not the one I'm currently attending) my father was just generally angry with me- he was in a terrible mood and he wouldn't even talk to me about the school.

I convinced myself that the school I'm currently at was 100% the school for me, I went on a new student tour, looked at resources, made connections, etc. But as time has gone on, I feel more and more that this isn't the case. The feeling was especially spurred on by my visit to my girlfriend's school. She goes to a university right in the heart of the same city I wanted to go to school for, and the feeling just walking around on campus is wildly different than it is here. This might sound silly, but I wasn't afraid to wear the keychains on my bag like I am at my current school. Everyone was so different there, and here everyone seems like they stepped out of the same mass-produced box. When my girlfriend came to visit me for a weekend, she told me that it was eerie how basically everyone here looked and acted the same. I'm like the complete opposite of the average student here (not straight, not white), and the student body is about as diverse as a country club in the south. The university I was considering is still a PWI (60% white), but compared to my current universities' 10% minority student population, it's a whole lot better.

The only things keeping me here, though, are my parents, having to up and leave, and (although stupid) my fears of going to a non-name brand/big school. I'm terrified that my parents will quit helping me through school, or just straight-up not believe me if I say I want to transfer. They know I have some friends, and they've been big supporters of the sport I play here (rugby), and I doubt they'll let me transfer. I'm scared to leave only due to the small comforts I've found here. I have a coffee shop I absolutely love, my favorite spot to sit in the warm weather, and the sport I've been playing. I keep mentioning it, but it's true. We're a great rugby team and we compete on the national level, and I love the community I've found within the team. I'm not playing this current semester (Spring '25) but I plan on being back next semester. My fear of not going to a name-brand school is insanely shallow, I know, but it's something my parents have instilled onto me. Even though the school I originally wanted to attend is pretty well-known, the one I'm currently at is known MUCH more. All sports are D1 here, and the alum network is massive. I'm just scared I won't get access to the same things at the uni I want to transfer to.

If you've read this far, thanks! I'm just at my wits end and thought I'd give asking here a chance. If anyone needs extra details or clarification, I'll provide it.",3,1739847374.0,CollegeTransfer,2,1.0,False

I tried scrubbing with all sorts of things; store-bought cleaners, brushes, even magic erasers but nothing worked. I was getting frustrated, but then I remembered an old cleaning tip from my grandmother: baking soda and vinegar. 

I sprinkled a generous amount of baking soda over the stained areas, then poured vinegar on top. It fizzed up, and I let it sit for about 10 minutes, just enough time to take a break and grab a coffee. After the fizzing stopped, I grabbed a scrubbing brush, and to my surprise, the stains started to lift with very little effort. I was shocked how well it worked and how little elbow grease I needed!

It became my go-to cleaning method for tough stains, and now I use it regularly in bathrooms and even for some kitchen cleaning.",10,1739847332.0,CleaningTips,4,0.69,False

Thus, handle your Lixada mess kit with care and avoid using abrasive cleaners.

Though it started as a headcanon it‚Äôs morphed into something too vivid to reduce to a simple thought, but not thought out enough for fanfic. So, I thought I‚Äôd share what I spent my lunch break getting out of my minds eye.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-


Quiet, Restful, Eternal


I dream of Bryce seeking Hypaxia because she hasn‚Äôt felt well since Hunt left for Hel to assist Apollion and Thanatos with a new creation that is pivotal in their plan to rid every world of the Asteri (but we know that‚Äôs BS). She tells Hypaxia that she feels like she is withdrawing, craving something without knowing what it is. Despite being injected with Synth and receiving the antidote, it‚Äôs all she can think of to compare it to. Pax runs a full work-up and finds an abnormality in her blood that is typically seen when people withdraw from the Viper Queen‚Äôs venom.  Instead of the VP‚Äôs naturally produced venom, this one has properties that leads Pax to believe that whatever is in Bryce‚Äôs system is synthetically made, potentially identifying why Bryce feels as through she is withdrawing. 

Bryce has several realizations that fly through her- Hunt putting the tablet in her drink at the Ballet to test for position, but not in anyone else‚Äôs drink. She wasn‚Äôt able to control her star from shining. Almost as if it was warning her.
Every time Hunt insisted on making her coffee and cooking for her. Had he been adding things?- and after they had sex‚Ä¶ he absorbed, no stole some of her power. Enough power that he was able to wear the Mask. Cold rage washes over her and she asks Pax to help her remove the synth venom from herself. Pax warns Bryce that because it‚Äôs an unknown, potentially synthetic venom that she doesn‚Äôt have an antidote for, she will have to purge her the old way. A long, painful process that typically kills the addicted person after being injected with an ancient concoction. Bryce, being head strong doesn‚Äôt care and begs her to do it anyway, guilting her into an oath that she won‚Äôt tell her friends/family until 3 days have passed or if she is about to die. 

Pax swears the oath and helps Bryce onto the metal table in the center of a white tiled room, a viewing area to the right of Bryce is where Pax will monitor her. Pax uses leather restraints to hold down her arms, hands, legs, feet and pelvis. As she is about to put the bite block in Bryce‚Äôs mouth she informs her of the sedative she will administer before starting. Bryce looks Pax dead in the eyes and tells her that she will not take a sedative and that she wants to remember every single moment of the purge- Pax reluctantly agrees. 

After strapping the bite block around Bryce‚Äôs head and injecting a purple-hued substance into her thigh, Pax walks out of the room and immediately feels something snap into place in the doorway behind her- she reaches up and her hand presses against an invisible, impenetrable shield. Bryce has warded the room. But how? Pax yells at her but she can‚Äôt seem to hear her, so with no way of reaching Bryce, she sits at the window and watches as Bryce beings to convulse. 

Nearing the end of day 3, Pax‚Äôs powers tell her that Bryce‚Äôs life force is fading. She sits in a lone chair in front of the viewing window exhausted and guilt-ridden. She tried multiple times to get through the warded door over the last 71 hours and 59 minutes without success. After Pax feels the oath release her she immediately calls Ruhn to inform him of what‚Äôs going on. He teleports into the viewing area almost immediately where Pax is pacing, chewing on her finger nails. Ruhn rushes to the warded door despite Pax‚Äôs warnings and tries to burst through the wards. He y hen attempts teleporting only to end up back in the viewing area. Feeling Ruhn‚Äôs panic, Lidia arrives shortly after followed by Baxian. They all try to enter the room but, you guessed it, they can‚Äôt. 

One moment Ruhn is watching his sister die and  the next he is blinded by the brightest light that he has ever seen. It reminds him of how a star expands before it dies, devouring everything in its path. It takes several moments for Ruhn and the others to be able to see and when they all recover and look up, there is complete and total darkness in the room as if a black wall was erected in front of the window. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

All Bryce sees is white, incandescent light. It feels as though she is being burned from the inside out, her light purging itself along with the synth venom from her veins. She‚Äôs dying. She knows this with absolute certainty, though for reasons she doesn‚Äôt know, she feels as though this will be her final run-in with death and without any hope of return.  She‚Äôll see Danika again. And the Pack of Devils‚Ä¶ Lehabah. It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad, would it? To drift off into oblivion, to be free of the pain and suffering and to see those she loves again? A calm sense washes over Bryce‚Ä¶ no not calm‚Ä¶

Quiet. 

In the back of her mind she feels a gentle yet demanding pull- similar to when you‚Äôve had too much to drink and you feel like your head is melting into the surface you‚Äôre laying on just before you get the spins. Then pull, more of a tug now, lowers, inch-by-inch to her abdomen. The tug becomes stronger, less yielding. Her minds-eye looks toward this tug and sees two hazel orbs, unmoving, unwavering in dim lighting. Reach for them. That‚Äôs all she can think to do. Her hands twitch toward the orbs and then, total darkness envelops her, is inside of her, IS her. She doesn‚Äôt feel pain, she doesn‚Äôt feel scared, she doesn‚Äôt feel alone. Right. She feels right and at‚Ä¶ home. Was this the afterlife?Had she finally drifted beyond the point of no return? 

Restful. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare.‚Äù 

Bryce lurches back. It wasn‚Äôt a voice, not really. But it was there, she understood it, like shadows given sound‚Ä¶ demanding and as real as anything ever had been. 

‚ÄúYou have left this life without me twice and I will not allow it to happen again.‚Äù

She blinks, or what she assumes is blinking but she can‚Äôt feel anything aside from that tug and‚Ä¶ her hands‚Ä¶ she feels her hands. Something was sliding, wrapping-around them, firm but gentle, jagged, calloused and‚Ä¶ hers. It was hers if she could just reach for it, open her heart to it. 
Hands, they were hands and she needs to close her fingers around them, wants to if only to wander over the peaks and valleys in the skin. A raised map leading her home. 

‚ÄúNow, Bryce!‚Äù 

She obeys without a second thought, squeezing, clenching, tugging the hands toward her, or were they tugging her toward them? 

She feels like she is floating down a cool, night-kissed river- Relaxed, tranquil, safe. The darkness stays with her, cradling her a little longer as if it‚Äôs afraid to let go, afraid she‚Äôll be swept down river. But- she is the darkness and the darkness is her, it won‚Äôt leave her and she won‚Äôt leave it. 

Eternal. 

Suddenly, as if being soothed out of a dream by your parent soothingly stroking your face, her eyes peel open. Shouts and cries fill the room. Her eyes open more to see Ruhn, Lidia, Baxian and Hypaxia standing over her, helping her out of her restrains and bite block. Bryce doesn‚Äôt look at any of them, doesn‚Äôt speak to them, her eyes snap fully open, frantically looking around the room searching for something. Her neck cranes to search more of the room, looking for a feeling more than any physical being. What was she looking for? It was like in those first moments after you slowly wake up and your mind tries to grasp the memory of a dream you‚Äôre not quite ready to let go of. So easily lost and forgotten, but occasionally you catch it, hold on to it, cherish it. 

The smell of mist and cedar fills her nose as she takes her first deep breath in what seems like forever. Throat raw from screaming, Bryce said softly, like shadows given sound, 

‚ÄúAzriel.‚Äù

I want to share a drink that could transform your mornings, especially if you‚Äôre managing diabetes or striving for a flatter stomach. This powerful, natural detox drink consists of simple ingredients: **apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, and water**. When consumed on an empty stomach, it can kickstart your metabolism, stabilize blood sugar levels, and aid in weight management. Let‚Äôs dive into the details of how it works, its benefits, and how you can incorporate it into your daily routine.

**1. Morning Rituals for a Healthier Start**

Starting your day with warm water, coffee, or tea can stimulate digestion and prepare your body for the day ahead. This preps your nervous system and digestive enzymes for optimal functionality, setting the stage for the apple cider vinegar and lemon juice drink to work even better.

**2. How Apple Cider Vinegar Works for Diabetes**

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a powerhouse ingredient that has been used for centuries. Its acetic acid content:

* **Improves Insulin Sensitivity**: Helps your body use insulin more effectively, reducing blood sugar spikes.
* **Regulates Blood Sugar**: Consuming diluted ACV before meals can lower post-meal glucose levels.
* **Speeds Up Metabolism**: Promotes fat breakdown and enhances calorie burning.
* **Suppresses Appetite**: Keeps you feeling full longer, reducing unnecessary snacking.

**3. Lemon Juice‚Äôs Role in Detox and Immunity**

Lemon juice is another vital ingredient packed with vitamin C, antioxidants, and enzymes. Its benefits include:

* **Cleanses the Blood and GI Tract**: Lemon juice acts as a gentle diuretic, helping flush out toxins.
* **Supports Digestion**: Encourages stomach acid production, aiding in better nutrient absorption.
* **Boosts Immunity**: Vitamin C strengthens your body‚Äôs defenses against illnesses.
* **Alleviates Bloating**: Reduces water retention and promotes a flatter stomach.

**4. The Recipe**

Here‚Äôs how you can prepare this diabetes-friendly detox drink:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Place a few fresh mint leaves in a pitcher and crush them lightly to release their aroma.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬† Add 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬† Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into the mix.

4.¬†¬†¬†¬† Add 1 cup of water (warm or cold, depending on your preference).

5.¬†¬†¬†¬† (Optional) Add a natural sweetener like stevia or monk fruit for taste.

6.¬†¬†¬†¬† Stir well and enjoy!

**5. Customizing the Drink**

If you‚Äôd like to enhance the flavor, consider adding:

* **Lemongrass**: Adds a fresh, citrusy aroma.
* **Cinnamon**: Regulates blood sugar and adds a sweet-spicy flavor.
* **Pepper**: Improves nutrient absorption.
* **Cucumber Slices**: Adds a refreshing twist.

**6. The Science Behind Apple Cider Vinegar**

Apple cider vinegar is made by fermenting apple sugars into alcohol and then converting it into acetic acid. Acetic acid has been studied for its:

* **Anti-diabetic properties**: Helps lower fasting blood sugar levels.
* **Anti-cholesterol effects**: Reduces LDL (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides over time.
* **Antioxidant features**: Protects cells from oxidative stress and damage.

**7. Why Lemon Juice Complements Apple Cider Vinegar**

Lemon juice doubles the vitamin C content and adds to the drink‚Äôs overall benefits. It also contributes to:

* **Improved Skin Health**: Collagen production is boosted, keeping your skin youthful.
* **Reduced Aging Effects**: Antioxidants fight free radicals that cause premature aging.
* **Weight Loss**: Lemons can curb appetite and promote fat breakdown.

**8. Precautions for Safe Consumption**

While this drink offers numerous benefits, it‚Äôs essential to consume it correctly:

* Always dilute apple cider vinegar with water to prevent tooth enamel erosion.
* Limit the drink to once a day to avoid overconsumption of acidic ingredients.
* If you dislike the taste, consider using **apple cider vinegar gummies** as an alternative.

**9. Supports Weight Loss Goals**

Apple cider vinegar is not a magic potion for weight loss, but it can assist when combined with:

* **Intermittent Fasting**: Enhances fat-burning during fasting periods.
* **Daily Exercise**: Amplifies metabolism and calorie burning.
* **Low-Carb Diet**: Stabilizes blood sugar levels and reduces cravings.

**10. Improves Heart Health**

Consuming apple cider vinegar regularly has been linked to lower cholesterol and improved cardiovascular health, reducing risks associated with diabetes, such as hypertension and heart disease.

**11. Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

Both apple cider vinegar and lemon juice help reduce inflammation in the body, which is crucial for preventing diabetes-related complications.

**12. Easy to Incorporate**

This drink is not only easy to prepare but also versatile. You can have it as a standalone morning drink or pair it with a light breakfast for a balanced start to your day.

**13. Alternative Ingredients**

If you‚Äôre not a fan of lemons, lime juice works just as well. Lime has a similar nutrient profile and provides the same benefits, with a slightly more tangy flavor.

**14. Hydration Boost**

Adding this drink to your routine encourages better hydration. Staying hydrated is critical for managing diabetes and overall health.

**15. Regular Usage Yields Better Results**

Consistency is key. Drinking this detox juice daily is more effective than sporadic consumption. Even small amounts of ACV and lemon juice can lead to noticeable improvements over time.

**16. A Word of Caution**

Overconsumption of apple cider vinegar can lead to:

* Enamel erosion.
* Reduced potassium levels.
* Digestive discomfort. Moderation is crucial to enjoy the benefits without adverse effects.

**17. Perfect for a Morning Detox**

The combination of apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, and water cleanses your system, helping you feel lighter and more energetic throughout the day.

**18. Cost-Effective Solution**

This drink is affordable, making it an excellent addition to your daily health regimen without breaking the bank.

**19. Boosts Mental Clarity**

Starting your day with a detox drink like this may enhance mental focus and clarity by reducing inflammation and improving gut health.

**20. Simple Yet Powerful**

Though it‚Äôs easy to make, the benefits of this drink are significant. From managing blood sugar to promoting weight loss, it‚Äôs a natural remedy worth trying.

Incorporating this juice into your morning routine can be a game-changer for diabetics and anyone looking to enhance their health. Try it for ten days, and let the results speak for themselves!

My painter highly recommended SW Duration Flat and told me that SW Duration Flat has a higher sheen that a regular Flat and was supposed to be similar to a true Matte in durability and sheen.

I've slightly rubbed a monitor cable down the wall when connecting to my PC and it created scuff marks all along the side of the wall. Not a golf club, or mallet, or anything ridiculous.. A monitor cable...

The coverage was also horrible, it took the painter like 1 coat of primer + 4 coats of SW Duration to cover over the previous colour. They were painting a lighter colour (swiss coffee) over a dark blue wall, but I feel like it shouldn't take effectively 5 coats of paint and primer.

I also don't know why people say that Duration Flat = Almost Matte, and Duration Matte = Almost Eggshell. Sherwin says that the Gloss/Sheen of Flat is 3 and Matte is 6 (60/85) which is nowhere near the Gloss/Sheen of a regular Matte or Eggshell respectively.",0,1739846138.0,paint,22,0.5,False

I just saw a post of someone being like ""what do I say when someone calls me skinny"" and several of the comments are things like ""just tell them 'yea and you're so fat' üòà"" hmm wonder why you'd suggest that? It's almost like u are admitting that you KNOW fat shaming stings worse and is an actual genuine insult, even in the conversation where you're pretending that skinny shaming is somehow equal. If someone called me skinny, I'd be saying thank u lmfao. When I was a kid I was underweight and I was skinny shamed for years. I'd much rather go back to that. I developed an eating disorder just trying desperately to go back to that and to get that high once again from the attention people gave me for my thinness because it was always either overly positive, jealousy, or concern for my well-being. Those are all good things. Yea maybe if you're deeply anorexic and never wanna recover then you're annoyed by people's concern for you, but it is not a negative insult that they called u skinny. Being ""fat"" is a whole different ballgame, especially for women. Dude any woman over like BMI 20 gets considered fat in America I think, unless their fat is veeeery conveniently stored in the right places. The moment I reached a healthy bmi, my life took a dark turn. Slowly I went from people being amazed whenever I ate a pizza and begging me to eat more, to people suggesting I put the pizza down and recommending me intermittent fasting and keto diets. Did I mention the part where I've dealt w eating disorders? Yea. Not much more needs to be said. Fat shaming is used to control people and make them smaller yes physically but mentally. It's a tactic to destroy a person's confidence and a covert way of basically telling them they should d1e tbh because restrictive ed's are very very deadly. So can we stop the lies pls?? There's not a single magically naturally skinny person who can never gain weight btw. They're always eating in deficit or at maintenance and not making a true effort to fatten up because subconsciously, people don't wanna be fat. It's so fucking easy to go no exercise and eat high caloric food in surplus like crumbl cookies and fries ect ect and I promise these magically skinny people plaguedddd by genetics would suddenly see a change and be fat like they lie and pretend to dream of lmfao. If gaining weight was genuinely so difficult, then there wouldn't be an obesity epidemic. People aren't fat because they purposefully scarf down billions of calories at will. It's because they're not active enough and are eating in a surplus, even a mild surplus, consistently. Which is so easy to do in America especially like some coffees at Starbucks have like 800 calories in just the coffee. So no I will never ever believe that someone is just gifted by the lord and skinny is their natural body type and they're trying sooo hard to gain. They ain't.",0,1739845970.0,Vent,16,0.39,False

1is23a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/fican/comments/1is23a2/just_hit_spouse_fi_about_to_implement_the_plan/,Just hit Spouse FI - about to implement the plan!!,"Hey folks,

After a long journey since around 2014-15, I have pulled the trigger on becoming FI. I‚Äôm 44 and my partner is 42 -we both live in a big metro in Alberta. I gave my supervisor my notice last week. I believe my last day of work will be on March 28th‚Ä¶Still working out the details on the last day and my transition plan.

The journey here: I moved to Alberta at the end of 2012 for my first professional job. about a year later I met my partner, who immigrated from South America to be with me. We discovered FI¬† around 2014/15 and have been working towards the school ever since. I've worked in a management role since I arrived and have worked my way up to a senior leadership role, which I just¬† stepped down from. so I've had the luck of having a high paying job throughout this time.¬† My partner, as a newly arrived immigrant, struggled at first but has definitely found her stride and has moved into a managerial role herself.

My partner, given how hard she has worked to move up the corporate ladder as an immigrant to Canada, doesn't want to stop working yet. She wants to work a couple more years and build up her DB pension a bit more. This means I'm becoming spouse-FI.

Here is a breakdown on my assets/portfolio:

|| || |TFSA|199,404| |RRSP|139,841| |FHSA|9,979| |Non-Reg|847,851| |Non-reg 2|7,214| |**Total**|**1,204,289**|

ETF breakdown¬†

VXC - 37%

XEQT - 19%

HEQT - 15%

VDY - 15%

XDG - 7%

ZPR - 4%

USCC - 3%

I also own a 2-bedroom worth around $200,00, which is currently rented out. I own another condo outside of Canada (in a beautiful tropical location!!) worth around $130,000, also rented out. Both properties fully paid off. The former, after deductions, produces around $900/month and the latter around $650/month. Note: all assets are in CAD.

I have a DB pension that will pay me $3,600/month when I turn 65 for the rest of my life. CPP will pay me around $580/month and I would expect to receive around the max OAS of around $615 (give or take). All these are indexed to inflation, though my DB pension isn‚Äôt fully indexed (only 60% of Canada CPI). My partner also has a DB pension - we estimated that it will produce her with around $1,300/month at age 65 if she were to resign today, but as mentioned above, she wants to work a few more years to bump this up.¬† She will likely receive half of the OAS amount because she immigrated to Canada mid-career and we expect her to receive a similar CPP amount to mine. Her investment portfolio is above $500k with a similar breakdown to mine.

My portfolio produces around $2,100/month in dividends. My two properties produce around 1,200-1,300/month, totally a total of around $3,300-3,400/month. This will be my monthly income. My partner will be taking care of the rent, utilities and internet costs moving forward. I will be responsible for groceries and home insurance. I believe this will amount to around $550-650/month, leaving $2650 for the remainder of the month for things like my gym membership, going out for coffee and int‚Äôl travel. We are pretty frugal and don‚Äôt need the luxury lifestyle. Once my partner resigns, we will likely move to a lower cost country where we will spend $2,500-3,000 to live a very comfortable lifestyle. We both speak additional languages fluently (Spanish, Portuguese and English)...

The current portfolio setup strives to strike a balance between global growth ETFs and dividend/income funds to help fund a modest lifestyle during my first few years of FI. I don‚Äôt plan on selling any units and just living off the dividend/income I mentioned above. I have a small covered call ETF position that helps create higher income and I‚Äôm fine with losing a bit of the upside to receive some of this income in the early days of FI.

In terms of what is next, I will likely do some international slow travel to celebrate and decompress from a very stressful career. I plan on starting a small business, one with a partner and the other more of a side hustle project with little to no startup costs. This will provide me with the purpose I need but help me set my own work schedule and strive for a balance with health and other personal and social goals.

So that is the plan! I‚Äôm excited to finish up my last day at work so that I can truly detach from the grind and slow life down a few notches while I decompress and re-energize for what comes next.

I would love to hear from others who have recently hit FI and have transitioned into their new lives. What have they learned? What surprised them? How has their overall health improved etc.? Let‚Äôs keep the conversation going!:)",13,1739845805.0,fican,6,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

^(find the build in the Sims 4 gallery searching for #telomina) 

So, as some might know already. I am not in the EA creator program thanks to my Sims build. I do however occasionally like to build something I feel is missing in my game, and then I have inspiration from somewhere. This time, it is a Swedish city library, called ""The Garage Library"". This is a library I used to visit but don't anymore since there was some serious disturbances. So if the library seems chaotic to you when playing (with pretty bad folk music, or a surprisingly chillaxing jazz), then I have captured its essence. 

I hope you enjoy the lot if you download it!

I decided to place this library in Ravenwood, since there was a good sized lot that fit the purpose. I am not super detailed-oriented in my builds, so feel free to improve on the landscaping outside (there are images on google of the place).

The interior is open and spacious, but the shelves are placed in a way that you can still get a sense of privacy, if you manage to get a free spot. Since this is a convivial lot that encourages groups of people to come together it's not a ""quiet place"", and it has a designated area for kids.   


[Bottom floor pc stations \(yes they work on bar counters, unfortunately they are on those irl too\)](https://preview.redd.it/pz8qlbcs5tje1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=670fdf6546f14aa55d1ad4a54216b062cea7e038)

There are several computers, some in open spaces for quick business, if anyone needs a quick google search or contact the authorities, or print paper (irl that is). But upstairs you find a more quiet spot for intense studies.

[the quiet study spot has 4 desks, 2 with laptops](https://preview.redd.it/beks7y5m4tje1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=e50f5653fe997fe2bb7e9a2638c93d41793628cb)

  
The library even has a coffee shop, feel free to order yourself something nice, perhaps a cake to that? You can sit at any seat besides the computer seats while you eat & drink.

Adding some vending machines to replace the borrow-and -return and staff desk that you can find in the real library. 

Did someone say... a stage? Yes, this library even have special events some evenings! The regular library business might have closed then if you need a ticket for the event.

At the upstairs you can enjoy some hobbies, or... spy-equipment as well. As the library also have a skill & hobby section. At this library irl you can even borrow home tools like electric drills, or a full tool box!

In the Sims library there is also 2 sets of chess boards, mainly because this was a requirement in Sims for a library.

I don't have many people in my life period and the ones I do have I can't talk to about this. This is going to be long and I apologize for that in advance but I want to be as clear and open as possible in hopes someone can give me some advice. Or even just a different perspective than my weird brain can as I tend to overanalyze everything. And it bounces back and forth at random because my thoughts are all over so apologies for that as well. 

I met this guy awhile back. He isn't just any guy. He is the most beautiful man I've ever met. In every way. He completes me in almost every way possible and so often it seems that we are the same person. He is a mirror image to me in terms of likes, dislikes, values, desires, just about everything. But he is beautiful. His soul is so beautiful to me. And he is so absolutely handsome to me. I don't even want to look at anyone else. I've been in relationships and I've dated. Have not had the best track record in that department. I always get hurt in some way. And I leave. I've been through enough that I don't stay for any crap anymore. It took a long time to heal from past issues and I was doing so well for the past few years. I did not really want a relationship and have been clear about this to everyone else in my life.Ive always been better off alone.

 Anyways I posted something on Reddit, which is how I met (online) and connected with the guy. I was pulled to him like a magnet. He was literally smack dab in the middle of like 60 messages. I didn't talk to the ones before or after him but for some reason, I actually opened his full message and talked to him. We were both so enamored and were compatible on a crazy level. We eventually shifted to texting. The energy was so beautiful and amazing. We were beautiful together. And he was all I wanted. We were all each other wanted. We talked for a while before deciding to meet in the real world. He told me he had lots of free time and could come to me since we live like 45-55 minutes away. We both like driving so it wasn't a big deal. We ended up meeting half way, like 30 minutes for us both. We met and grew closer. After a bit of time I asked if I could get a hotel on his days off so we could be together and have our first sleepover. He was so excited and so we did. It was two days of euphoric bliss. We did everything together, kept physical contact of some sort the entire time and it was beautiful. 

Before leaving, I asked where his family, in particular his grandmother who he helps care for, thought he was and he said he didn't have to explain anything to anyone. Then said she knew he was with me. Anyways we moved on with day to day, at some point I was waiting for the next time we would see each other. But things kept happening..his uncle got sick. Then he got sick. Then he was getting better. His next days off he took some family out. I asked about getting together and he said he still had phlegm and didn't want me to get sick. And I keep dropping these hints always waiting. I brought up Valentines Day a few times thinking ok..this is the one day of the year to be here for me, with me. He insisted he would make the plans and to be patient and so I was.

 Then he got roped into working the second night so we were on just for V.Day. I was a little bummed but ok, i can deal with it. The night before he said he was going to come as soon as he could in the morning because he was so excited to see me. I was stoked.

The day of his sister came into town from out of state which I did not realize. I knew there was a family dinner on Sunday but I thought she lived here so it wasn't a big deal. And he kept texting, telling me he was trying to get out of there. For hours. In the end he said he wanted to reschedule and said his sister had planned this is advance. And he hadnt seen her in months. Like I was rude for expecting him to leave and go anywhere. I don't know if he even booked anything. I am thinking he had no intention of seeing me. I was so excited for this day because I knew I would get to see him. No, just hurt again. I mean it's just a bullshit holiday anyways, I guess? If it wasn't, he would have done anything to be together. Not used his family as an excuse.

 All the names before..queen, baby, etc have all been reduced to hun and an occasional honey. He now says I knew he was a family man when we met. He told me that after but I loved it because he talked about building our life together and thought I was a part of that..he spoke of our family we were building. He was always telling me he wanted to protect me and take care of me(not financially, like emotionally) and he would treat me the way I should have always been treated and I would never be hurt again. Now he keeps disappearing on me.

 A few weeks ago I questioned things because most men tell at least someone in their life they have a gf. He didn't, said he was private and didn't have to tell anyone anything, this was his life. He also before has said I was his life, was his everything, ""as it should be"". Anyways me questioning started a little something and he disappeared. I tried texting and calling and nothing for days. I called one night and told him i would be at our halfway spot the next morning and to please meet me so we could talk face to face. He didn't. Didn't reply.

 I called and texted. I was breaking down because I thought it was over and he was ghosting me. I begged him to please come and talk. Finally after waiting at this park for 3 hours he text and said he wasn't coming and I was making him uncomfortable rushing him to talk? And got defensive over the ghosting comment because he ""took time to think about things"". Most people say they need to take a minute so you aren't just wondering what is going on. I asked him to not disappear and he said ""IM NOT DISAPPEARING"". That was the 4th worst day of my life..i ended up having a panic attack and throwing up all over myself and my car, draining my battery and having to wait 3 hours for roadside assistance..i was there 6 hours that day. Complete breakdown. 

And I don't break over men. Ever. I walk away. Or run away. Anyways we somewhat worked things out and went kinda back to normal. Mostly. I still have felt so disconnected from him. I just needed anything. Any time. So many times asking for a halfway meet for an hour getting coffee or anything. Any of the beautiful promises that were made in the beginning. I would take 5 minutes being able to look into his eyes..then I would be able to see and know what is real. And I can't have even that.

 Then the V.Day thing happened. He came back and said the reason I probably feel ""hidden"" is because his grandmother gets jealous and selfish and has ruined his past relationships. That he has a life but not allowed to have time of his own. He basically alluded to that being why I was hidden or whatever. So there may be lies involved, idk. Basically a complete 360 from what he said in the beginning. Idk what is going on. He tells me partial information and it leaves me in a constant confused state. The last I heard was around 7pm on V.Day that his sister was gonna help him figure this out. I asked if it was about his grandma? No reply. And I haven't heard from him since.  

I am so hurt. I just want time with my bf. What happened to him? Everything has changed so much and I don't understand. I have fallen in love with this beautiful man but I would rather just cut me loose if he doesn't feel the same. I don't want him to keep me dangling out of pity, especiallybecauseof my past.

 In a perfect world he would be what he was before. I want him to be the loving bf he was. But I don't know what to do. In all my life I have never felt for another person what I feel for him. And I see him the way he was still and if it is all misunderstandings and he has been just going through alot with his family I don't want to walk away. I wish he would have told me all of it at the beginning, just as I threw all my negative out there for him. Also something I've never in my life done with anyone. I would have been there for him and we would have avoided so much drama. I truly see a life with him. He asked me about forever a few times and I am still on board for that. But only if he still really wants me. I don't want this emotional hurt, it is so foreign to me and I don't know how to process it. I'm not use to feeling any of this.

 I am starting to feel like maybe I am just a game? And I cant do head games. And he doesn't even know I am across the country at this moment because of an emergency. I've really needed him to help me not be alone through something serious. But it seems like the universe makes it happen like this and I have to struggle alone, like always. He said so many beautiful things and this is one of them..never having to go through life alone. I don't want a text only bf. And there is no ""long distance"". We live less than an hour apart. How does someone go from being willing to drive anywhere at anytime to be with you during all their free time because you are their #1 priority, their ""life"" to‚Ä¶making excuses about long distance relationships and having no time and not being allowed to see me? Why did he even pursue me to begin with? 

And that is why I've begun to think he isn't into me. Or maybe I've got it confused again and he was hopeful the grandma wouldn't be a problem or interfere. Omg I just don't know what to think. Or do. I can't concentrate on anything and cry randomly. And have to lie to my daughter about why I randomly burst into tears because I don't want her to think negatively before she even meets him. 

I would literally give a limb at this moment to be able to sit down and have a face to face conversation about everything and find out where we stand. No matter what he decides. I just can't handle this. But I can't keep chasing him down when he ignores me and disappears. I won't play those games anymore, they push me too far and I can not sink that far down. But I have a feeling if I don't reach out and beg him to talk to me, again just like last time, I will never hear from him again. It makes me feel sick to my stomach. I've tried being patient but he never tells me for what. If he is sincere about what he is dealing with, then he needs to decide if I'm important enough to fight for. Or if he is gonna let her ruin another relationship for him. He goes from at one point freaking out over how he can't lose me to just... idk? He keeps saying opening up about his family would scare me away. It wouldnt. I dont get scared away. But he is starting to lose me. All of this is pushing me to points i cant go to..pushing me away.. not being there‚Ä¶the changes‚Ä¶the different stories‚Ä¶and as much as i already do feel and as much as I want him, I cant stay if this doesnt stop. Even though I am trying so hard..to be patient and hope he is sincere.

 On V.Day I asked him if he was in love. At least that would tell me he does or doesnt want this. He didnt reply. And then I did, disgustingly, tell him via text since that is all I have lately, that I have fallen in love with him. He ignored that too. There is so much I can and want to say to give the full picture. But it is too much. I just want him back. The him that he was. If that was the real him. And if it wasnt the real him, I just wish he would be honest. My head is so twisted and confused I dont know what to think about anything. 

And if you do offer insight or advice, please..be respectful towards him. Regardless of how things have unfolded between us, I truly have love for this man and do not want anyone bashing him. I'm not perfect and have made mistakes, especially trying to push him away. Just please be respectful!   

 Missing any angles or being ghosted now that we are going on 4 days? Maybe he is trying to get rid of me nicely? I dont want to walk away but he is pushing me that way. I have never cared so deeply or felt anything even close for someone in a romantic sense. I have always been mildly annoyed at men calling a woman ""queen""..I not only allow him to call me that but I actually really adored it. I adored being his queen, his delicate treasure that he needed to protect and take care of. THAT is how hard I have fallen for him.  

Fuck, I am so lost. I miss him and just want him back..my beautiful, sweet, loving man. Help? Any advice. All advice. Its possible I have gotten things mixed up and there are just alot of misunderstandings.. If so, what then?  I need to make him understand this needs to stop happening and these things are hurtful, we should be working together. Or maybe I am just being a pathetic, sad bitch that needs to just go back to what I am good at. Being alone.

# The Problem with ‚ÄúDumb‚Äù Search

Early in my career, I built a recipe recommendation app that matched keywords like ‚Äúchicken‚Äù to recipes containing ‚Äúchicken.‚Äù It failed spectacularly. Users searching for ‚Äúquick weeknight meals‚Äù didn‚Äôt care about keywords ‚Äî they wanted¬†*context*: meals under 30 minutes, minimal cleanup, kid-friendly. Traditional search couldn‚Äôt bridge that gap.

Vector search changes this. Instead of treating data as strings, it maps everything ‚Äî text, images, user behavior ‚Äî into¬†**numerical vectors**¬†that capture meaning. For example, ‚Äúquick weeknight meals,‚Äù ‚Äú30-minute dinners,‚Äù and ‚Äúeasy family recipes‚Äù cluster closely in vector space, even with zero overlapping keywords. This is how AI starts to ‚Äúthink‚Äù like us .

# What This Article Is About

This article is my try to dives into how vector search is revolutionizing AI‚Äôs ability to discover patterns, relationships, and insights at unprecedented speed and precision. By moving beyond rigid keyword matching, vector search enables machines to understand context, infer intent, and retrieve results with human-like intuition. Through Python code examples, system design diagrams, and industry use cases (like accelerating drug discovery and personalizing content feeds), we‚Äôll explore how this technology makes AI systems faster, more adaptable.

# Why Read It?

* **For Developers:**¬†Build lightning-fast search systems using modern tools like FAISS and Hugging Face, with optimizations for real-world latency and scale.
* **For Business Leaders:**¬†Discover how vector search drives competitive advantages in customer experience, fraud detection, and dynamic pricing.
* **For Innovators:**¬†Learn why hybrid architectures and multimodal AI are the future of intelligent systems.
* **Bonus:**¬†Lessons from my own journey deploying vector search ‚Äî including costly mistakes and unexpected breakthroughs.

# So, What Vector Search Really is ?

Imagine you‚Äôre in a music store. Instead of searching for songs by title (like ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody‚Äù), you hum a tune. The clerk matches your hum to songs with similar¬†*melodic patterns*, even if they‚Äôre in different genres. Vector search works the same way: it finds data based on¬†*semantic patterns*, not exact keywords.

Vector search maps data (text, images, etc.) into high-dimensional numerical vectors. Similarity is measured using distance metrics (e.g., cosine similarity).

# Use below code to understand vector space in a very simpler way

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
    import numpy as np  
    
    # Mock embeddings: [sweetness, crunchiness]  
    fruits = {  
        ""Apple"": [0.9, 0.8],  
        ""Banana"": [0.95, 0.2],  
        ""Carrot"": [0.3, 0.95],  
        ""Grapes"": [0.85, 0.1]  
    }  
    
    # Plotting  
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))  
    for fruit, vec in fruits.items():  
        plt.scatter(vec[0], vec[1], label=fruit)  
    plt.xlabel(""Sweetness ‚Üí""), plt.ylabel(""Crunchiness ‚Üí"")  
    plt.title(""Fruit Vector Space"")  
    plt.legend()  
    plt.grid(True)  
    plt.show()  

Banana and Grapes cluster near high sweetness, while Carrot stands out with crunchiness.

# Can We Implement Vector Search Ourselves?

**Yes!**¬†Let‚Äôs build a minimal vector search engine using pure Python:

    import numpy as np  
    from collections import defaultdict  
    
    class VectorSearch:  
        def __init__(self):  
            self.index = defaultdict(list)  
    
        def add_vector(self, id: int, vector: list):  
            self.index[id] = np.array(vector)  
    
        def search(self, query_vec: list, k=3):  
            query = np.array(query_vec)  
            distances = {}  
            for id, vec in self.index.items():  
                # Euclidean distance  
                distances[id] = np.linalg.norm(vec - query)  
            # Return top K closest  
            return sorted(distances.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[:k]  
    
    # Example usage  
    engine = VectorSearch()  
    engine.add_vector(1, [0.9, 0.8])  # Apple  
    engine.add_vector(2, [0.95, 0.2])  # Banana  
    engine.add_vector(3, [0.3, 0.95])  # Carrot  
    
    query = [0.88, 0.15]  # Sweet, not crunchy  
    results = engine.search(query, k=2)  
    print(f""Top matches: {results}"")  # Output: [(2, 0.07), (1, 0.15)] ‚Üí Banana, Apple  

**Key Limitations:**

* Brute-force search (O(n) time) ‚Äî impractical for large datasets.
* No dimensionality reduction or indexing.

# The Mechanics of Smarter, Faster Discovery

# Step 1: Teaching Machines to ‚ÄúUnderstand‚Äù (Embeddings)

Vector search begins with¬†**embedding models**, which convert data into dense numerical representations. Let‚Äôs encode product reviews using Python‚Äôs¬†`sentence-transformers`:

    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
    
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    reviews = [
        ""This blender is loud but crushes ice perfectly."", 
        ""Silent coffee grinder with inconsistent grind size."",
        ""Powerful juicer that‚Äôs easy to clean.""
    ]
    embeddings = model.encode(reviews)
    
    print(f""Embedding shape: {embeddings.shape}"")  # (3, 384)

Despite no shared keywords, the first and third reviews (‚Äúblender‚Äù and ‚Äújuicer‚Äù) will be neighbors in vector space because both emphasize¬†*functionality*¬†over noise levels .

# Step 2: Speed Without Sacrifice (Indexing)

Raw vectors are useless without efficient retrieval. Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms like HNSW balance speed and accuracy. Here‚Äôs a FAISS implementation:

    import faiss
    
    dimension = 384
    index = faiss.IndexHNSWFlat(dimension, 32)  # 32=neighbor connections for speed
    index.add(embeddings)
    
    # Find similar products to a query
    query = model.encode([""Compact kitchen appliance for smoothies""])
    distances, indices = index.search(query, k=2)
    print([reviews[i] for i in indices[0]])  # Returns blender and juicer reviews

This code retrieves results in milliseconds, even with billions of vectors ‚Äî a game-changer for real-time apps like live customer support .

# Step 3: Hybrid Intelligence

Pure vector search can miss exact matches (e.g., SKU codes). Hybrid systems merge vector and keyword techniques. Below is a Mermaid diagram of a real-time product search architecture I designed for an e-commerce client:

Based on my experience, this system boosted conversion rates by 22% by blending semantic understanding with business rules.

# Now, let‚Äôs understand Popular Vector Search Algorithms

# a) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Brute-force exact search.

    from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors  
    
    # Mock dataset  
    X = np.array([[0.9, 0.8], [0.95, 0.2], [0.3, 0.95]])  
    knn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=2, metric='euclidean')  
    knn.fit(X)  
    
    # Query  
    distances, indices = knn.kneighbors([[0.88, 0.15]])  
    print(f""Indices: {indices}, Distances: {distances}"")  # Matches Banana (index 1)  

# b) Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)

Trade accuracy for speed.¬†**HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)**¬†example using¬†`hnswlib`:

    import hnswlib  
    
    # Build index  
    dim = 2  
    index = hnswlib.Index(space='l2', dim=dim)  
    index.init_index(max_elements=1000, ef_construction=200, M=16)  
    index.add_items(X)  
    
    # Search  
    labels, distances = index.knn_query([[0.88, 0.15]], k=2)  
    print(f""HNSW matches: {labels}"")  # [1, 0] ‚Üí Banana, Apple  

# c) IVF (Inverted File Index)

Partitions data into clusters.

    import faiss  
    
    # IVF example  
    quantizer = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dim)  
    index_ivf = faiss.IndexIVFFlat(quantizer, dim, 2)  # 2 clusters  
    index_ivf.train(X)  
    index_ivf.add(X)  
    
    # Search  
    index_ivf.nprobe = 1  # Search 1 cluster  
    D, I = index_ivf.search(np.array([[0.88, 0.15]]).astype('float32'), k=2)  
    print(f""IVF matches: {I}"")  # [1, 0]  

# 4. Advanced Vector Search

# a) Multimodal Search

Combine text and image vectors:

    # Mock CLIP-like embeddings  
    text_embedding = [0.4, 0.6]  
    image_embedding = [0.38, 0.58]  
    
    # Concatenate or average  
    multimodal_vec = np.concatenate([text_embedding, image_embedding])  
    
    # Search across both modalities  
    class MultimodalIndex:  
        def __init__(self):  
            self.texts = []  
            self.images = []  
    
        def add(self, text_vec, image_vec):  
            self.texts.append(text_vec)  
            self.images.append(image_vec)  
    
        def search(self, query_vec, alpha=0.5):  
            # Weighted sum  
            scores = [alpha * np.dot(query_vec, t) + (1-alpha) * np.dot(query_vec, i)  
                      for t, i in zip(self.texts, self.images)]  
            return sorted(enumerate(scores), key=lambda x: -x[1])  

# b) Hybrid Search

Combine vector + keyword search using reciprocal rank fusion:

    def hybrid_search(vector_results, keyword_results, weight=0.7):  
        combined = {}  
        for rank, (id, _) in enumerate(vector_results):  
            combined[id] = combined.get(id, 0) + (1 - rank/10) * weight  
        for rank, (id, _) in enumerate(keyword_results):  
            combined[id] = combined.get(id, 0) + (1 - rank/10) * (1 - weight)  
        return sorted(combined.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1])  
    
    # Example  
    vector_results = [(2, 0.1), (1, 0.2)]  # Banana, Apple  
    keyword_results = [(3, 0.9), (1, 0.8)]  # Carrot, Apple  
    print(hybrid_search(vector_results, keyword_results))  # Apple (1) ranks highest

Bake the coffee cake according to the package, leaving out the crumble topping (put that in a bowl for later)  Let it cool.  Crumble and mix with cream cheese frosting. Roll into balls and freeze for at least an hour.  When you're ready to dip them, melt white chocolate wafers for the cake pop coating.  After dipping the cake pop, let the white chocolate mostly set, then dip the cake pop in the crumble topping.

I'd like to discuss my history and ongoing issues both as a way to vent and to get some advice. Additionally, if anyone else is experiencing/searching this, know you are not alone! (Also, writing this in such a way, so that those searching just like how I was searching, can find it)

[30M]
In early December 2024, I noticed some unusual urinary issues

* Slight burning sensation when peeing (and i do mean slight.)
* Urinary Frequency (I felt like I had to go alot more)
* Little Discharge (looking back this should have been a bigger clue)
* Sensitive penis head

At first, I had thought these were problems with frequent masturbation (I know, stupid) and decided to give it some time to heal. It did not. Two weeks later I ordered an the extended STD test from Quest; positive for chlamydia. I went to Urgent Care, told the Doctor, was prescribed a week of doxy, and took it religiously. This was 3rd week of December.

During the doxy and for about a week after, I was fine. Then the following symptoms have appeared

* Constant sensation of urine stuck in urethra/penis. This feeling occurs right at the head as if there is just a little bit of liquid that needs to come out.
* Frequent urination (but this is really to try to get rid of the one above)
* Feeling of discharge coming from the penis tip. This I attribute to the urine sensation. I have checked underwear but never see any evidence.
* Tingling sensation inside the urethra. Only at the tip and like inside but on the bottom if that makes sense

About a week later, (mid January), I began panicking thinking there was something else wrong, after all I did the treatment. I read on here to test for Mgen and went and ordered that as well. Next day, went back to UrgentCare and told them my recurrent symptoms. Mistakenly told them what I thought (the Mgen) and was prescribed moxi. I took the whole course of antibiotics even though the test came back negative for mgen. Should also add, they did a NAAT for chlamydia and tested negative for chlamydia.

A week after that, I managed to get an appointment with a urologist, who told me that I would have to wait 2-3 months in severe cases to heal, and was sent on my way. (Would 2-4 weeks of symptomatic chlamydia be considered severe?) In the interim, I was prescribed Mirabegron to help with frequent urination. I also took a urine culture which was negative for bacteria (however, I was still on the moxi so that should be taken into account)

It has now officially been 2 months since then. For the last 2 weeks, I have been doing pelvic floor stretches (found a Youtube video and follow along), and tried some mindfulness (I'll be honest, I don't know how to do this, in the quiet I think about the constant ""wet"" feeling)

All to say, my current symptoms have remained. The 4 mentioned above are the only ones. I have no pain whatsoever. (Closest thing I can say to pain, is a testicle ache but only when I sleep on my side) I have begun monitoring my fluid intake (58 floz/1.5 L) and the times I pee (not the amount, don't know how you do that) as well. While I can hold it for 3-4 hours, the tingling and wet sensation drives me crazy, and sometimes I decide to go a bit sooner. In terms of diets, I don't drink alcohol,tea,or coffee and have not been eating spicy food. Habit wise, I have put a pause on masturbation, and going for 20 minute walks every day.

I have an upcoming appointment with a different urologist to get a second opinion and also because this symptom is hell.

My game plan is the following:

* Another full STD Panel. I will specify that I want MGen/MHominis, Ureaplasma (didn't have this test), Yeast exam, Gardnerella (read men can have this here)
* UTI test (rare in men, but you never know)
* Swab test.
* PSA Test (given my age, this might be harder)
* Urine culture (this time i will not be on antibiotics) and Semen Culture
* Prostate check
* Bladder and (Urethra if possible) ultrasounds
* Urodynamics / Cystoscopy? (Could this be a stricture?)

Thank you very much!

Anything else I am missing? I'd like to try and rule out any other issues. If you think it's something else, I'd love to hear what else it could be to bring up with my doctor.

Lastly, I have a question that's driving me crazy. If you ""milk"" your penis, is there supposed to be a clear liquid drop (more like less of a drop) that comes out/becomes visible? (I've done this randomly throughout the day. Majority of the time it appears. Should note, no erection/arousal was occurring)",1,1739844793.0,Prostatitis,1,1.0,False
