\*\*ABOUT BONE CHINA MATERIAL\*\*

Bone China is a hybrid hard-paste porcelain containing bone ash. Bone china is extremely hard, intensely white and will allow light to pass through it. Strength is provided by the fusion of ingredients during firing. This unique pottery body is made from the following: 

\--50% animal bone

\--25% china clay

\--25% china stone 

Bone ash is used in the production of bone china and makes up about 50% by weight of the final body recipe. It is produced from treated animal bone, which is then heated to about 1000 C.  At that extreme temperature, any residual organic material is burned off and the structure of the bone is altered to be able to form bone china. The high temperature used also sterilizes the bone. Once finely ground in water, the resulting bone elements gives traditional English bone china its translucency and sharp whiteness.",1,1770488210.0,u_NeverRaincheck,0,1.0,False

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.

Things have been amazing and throughout our relationship i have never doubted that I can trust him. He is amazing and we rarely fight and are very honest with each other. I have never been suspicious or had any reason to be. 

Yesterday we had a small fight and didn’t speak for a few hours. We reconciled this morning and things were good. We went for a coffee and hung out. When we were hanging out, i was on his phone and saw in his search history that he had been watching porn on twitter.

Upon finding this i was a bit taken aback, but what hurt the most was seeing him search for specific things such as “petite blonde”. I do not resemble this at all. 

I felt sick to my stomach and immediately left with no explanation. My boyfriend was not aware why i left or why i was annoyed. Later on after dodging numerous phone calls i told him why I left and he apologised. I told him that sorry does not cut it and i am currently not sure how to proceed. 

I am not only upset that he was searching specifically for women who don’t resemble me at all, suggesting that i am not his type whatsoever, but also that he was doing this when we were on bad terms. I feel like if we were to stay together i would doubt myself about how attracted he is to me and if he was being lustful towards other women (petite blonde ones for example) without me knowing. I feel like i would just be too insecure. I think it has broken a lot of trust.

It does matter the scenario, whether it's talking to my mother's friends, my friends partners, the coffee shop worker or a customer at work who's in her late 20's.

I remember once when my friends GF tired giving me a quick hello hug, instead of being normal and hugging her back, my body instead recoiled long before my mind realized what I did. Two weeks later, she looked me in the eyes and said ""No, we're not doing this again"" and practically forced me to hug her.

Sitting in the coffee shop and trying to relax isn't fun and instead really difficult, don't even get me started on being in a bar or nightclub.

I'm fully aware that's it's 100% my fault, I didn't speak to my female classmates while growing up. I've worked construction since my late teens and also only socialize with men.

When meeting new men, there's a strong chance that the conversation goes well, but not with women, the reason is because I simply don't know to act around them.

I was recently in a busy doctors waiting room and the only seat left was next to a woman (cute, late 20's). I of course wasn't going to stand the whole time and therefore sat next to her. For the entire time, I never opened my mouth, not even for basic greetings or small talk.

I like to read, anything everything from systems theory to modern french history, particularly energy and clean (it’s one of my passion).

**What I’m Looking For:**

A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself, sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

The Vibe: Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*. Let’s be catalysts, not conformists.( I don't have any societal morality )

**TL;DR:** Childfree, progressive, experimental and insatiably curious?

By [Andy Greenberg](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/)

""Since rumors began to spread that a startup called Palantir helped to kill Osama bin Laden, Alex Karp hasn't had much time to himself.

On one sun-baked July morning in Silicon Valley Palantir's lean 45-year-old chief executive, with a top-heavy mop of frazzled hair, hikes the grassy hills around Stanford University's massive satellite antennae known as the Dish, a favorite meditative pastime. But his solitude is disturbed somewhat by ""Mike,"" an ex-Marine--silent, 6 foot 1, 270 pounds of mostly pectoral muscle--who trails him everywhere he goes. **Even on the suburban streets of Palo Alto, steps from Palantir's headquarters, the bodyguard lingers a few feet behind.**

""It puts a massive cramp on your life,"" Karp complains, his expression hidden behind large black sunglasses. ""There's nothing worse for reducing your ability to flirt with someone.""

**Karp's 24/7 security detail is meant to protect him from extremists who have sent him death threats and conspiracy theorists who have called Palantir to rant about the Illuminati.** Schizophrenics have stalked Karp outside his office for days at a stretch. ""It's easy to be the focal point of fantasies,"" he says, ""if your company is involved in realities like ours.""

**Palantir lives the realities of its customers: the NSA, the FBI and the CIA--an early investor through its In-Q-Tel venture fund--along with an alphabet soup of other U.S. counterterrorism and military agencies.** **In the last five years Palantir has become the go-to company for mining massive data sets for intelligence and law enforcement applications, with a slick software interface and coders who parachute into clients' headquarters to customize its programs. Palantir turns messy swamps of information into intuitively visualized maps, histograms and link charts.** Give its so-called ""forward-deployed engineers"" a few days to crawl, tag and integrate every scrap of a customer's data, and **Palantir can elucidate problems as disparate as terrorism, disaster response and human trafficking.**

Palantir's advisors include Condoleezza Rice and former CIA director George Tenet, who says in an interview that ""I wish we had a tool of its power"" before 9/11. General David Petraeus, the most recent former CIA chief, describes Palantir to FORBES as ""a better mousetrap when a better mousetrap was needed"" and calls Karp ""sheer brilliant.""

**Among those using Palantir to connect the dots are the Marines, who have deployed its tools in Afghanistan for forensic analysis of roadside bombs and predicting insurgent attacks. The software helped locate Mexican drug cartel members who murdered an American customs agent and tracked down hackers who installed spyware on the computer of the Dalai Lama. In the book** ***The Finish*****, detailing the killing of Osama bin Laden, author Mark Bowden writes that Palantir's software ""actually deserves the popular designation Killer App.""**

And now Palantir is emerging from the shadow world of spies and special ops to take corporate America by storm. **The same tools that can predict ambushes in Iraq are helping pharmaceutical firms analyze drug data**. According to a former JPMorgan Chase staffer, they've saved the firm hundreds of millions of dollars by addressing issues from cyberfraud to distressed mortgages. **A Palantir user at a bank can, in seconds, see connections between a Nigerian Internet protocol address, a proxy server somewhere within the U.S. and payments flowing out from a hijacked home equity line of credit, just as military customers piece together fingerprints on artillery shell fragments, location data, anonymous tips and social media to track down Afghani bombmakers.**

Those tools have allowed Palantir's T-shirted twentysomethings to woo customers away from the suits and ties of IBM, Booz Allen and Lockheed Martin with a product that deploys faster, offers cleaner results and often costs less than $1 million per installation--a fraction of the price its rivals can offer. **Its commercial clients--whose identities it guards even more closely than those of its government customers--include Bank of America and News Corp.** Private-sector deals now account for close to 60% of the company's revenue, which FORBES estimates will hit $450 million this year, up from less than $300 million last year. Karp projects Palantir will sign a billion dollars in new, long-term contracts in 2014, a year that may also bring the company its first profits.

**The bottom line: A CIA-funded firm run by an eccentric philosopher has become one of the most valuable private companies in tech, priced at between $5 billion and $8 billion in a round of funding the company is currently pursuing**. Karp owns roughly a tenth of the firm--just less than its largest stakeholder, Peter Thiel, the PayPal and Facebook billionaire. (Other billionaire investors include Ken Langone and hedge fund titan Stanley Druckenmiller.) That puts Karp on course to become Silicon Valley's latest billionaire--and Thiel could double his fortune--if the company goes public, a possibility Karp says Palantir is reluctantly considering.

**The biggest problem for Palantir's business may be just how well its software works: It helps its customers see too much. In the wake of NSA leaker Edward Snowden's revelations of the agency's mass surveillance, Palantir's tools have come to represent privacy advocates' greatest fears of data-mining technology -- Google-level engineering applied directly to government spying.** **That combination of Big Brother and Big Data has come into focus just as Palantir is emerging as one of the fastest-growing startups in the Valley, threatening to contaminate its first public impressions and render the firm toxic in the eyes of customers and investors just when it needs them most.**

""They're in a scary business,"" says Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney **Lee Tien. ACLU analyst Jay Stanley has written that Palantir's software could enable a ""true totalitarian nightmare, monitoring the activities of innocent Americans on a mass scale.""**

Karp, a social theory Ph.D., doesn't dodge those concerns. **He sees Palantir as the company that can rewrite the rules of the zero-sum game of privacy and security**. ""I didn't sign up for the government to know when I smoke a joint or have an affair,"" he acknowledges. In a company address he stated, ""We have to find places that we protect away from government so that we can all be the unique and interesting and, in my case, somewhat deviant people we'd like to be.""

**Palantir boasts of technical safeguards for privacy that go well beyond the legal requirements for most of its customers, as well as a team of ""privacy and civil liberties engineers.""** But it's Karp himself who ultimately decides the company's path. ""He's our conscience,"" says senior engineer Ari Gesher.

The question looms, however, of whether business realities and competition will corrupt those warm and fuzzy ideals. When it comes to talking about industry rivals, Karp often sounds less like Palantir's conscience than its id. He expressed his primary motivation in his July company address: to ""kill or maim"" competitors like IBM and Booz Allen. ""I think of it like survival,"" he said. ""We beat the lame competition before they kill us.""

\*\*\*

**KARP SEEMS TO** enjoy listing reasons he isn't qualified for his job. ""He doesn't have a technical degree, he doesn't have any cultural affiliation with the government or commercial areas, his parents are hippies,"" he says, manically pacing around his office as he describes himself in the third person. ""How could it be the case that this person is cofounder and CEO since 2005 and the company still exists?""

**The answer dates back to Karp's decades-long friendship with Peter Thiel, starting at Stanford Law School. The two both lived in the no-frills Crothers dorm and shared most of their classes during their first year, but held starkly opposite political views.** Karp had grown up in Philadelphia, the son of an artist and a pediatrician who spent many of their weekends taking him to protests for labor rights and against ""anything Reagan did,"" he recalls. **Thiel had already founded the staunchly libertarian Stanford Review during his time at the university as an undergrad.**

""We would run into each other and go at it ... like wild animals on the same path,"" Karp says. ""Basically I loved sparring with him.""

With no desire to practice law, Karp went on to study under Jurgen Habermas, one of the 20th century's most prominent philosophers, at the University of Frankfurt. Not long after obtaining his doctorate, he received an inheritance from his grandfather, and began investing it in startups and stocks with surprising success. Some high-net-worth individuals heard that ""this crazy dude was good at investing"" and began to seek his services, he says. To manage their money he set up the London-based Caedmon Group, a reference to Karp's middle name, the same as the first known English-language poet.

**Back in Silicon Valley Thiel had cofounded PayPal and sold it to eBay in October 2002 for $1.5 billion. He went on to create a hedge fund called Clarium Capital but continued to found new companies: One would become Palantir**, named by Thiel for the Palantiri seeing stones from J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, orbs that allow the holder to gaze across vast distances to track friends and foes.

In a post-9/11 world Thiel wanted to sell those Palantiri-like powers to the growing national security complex: **His concept for Palantir was to use the fraud-recognition software designed for PayPal to stop terrorist attacks**. But from the beginning the libertarian saw Palantir as an antidote to--not a tool for--privacy violations in a society slipping into a vise of security. ""It was a mission-oriented company,"" says **Thiel, who has personally invested $40 million in Palantir and today serves as its chairman**. ""I defined the problem as needing to reduce terrorism while preserving civil liberties.""

In 2004 Thiel teamed up with Joe Lonsdale and Stephen Cohen, two Stanford computer science grads, and PayPal engineer Nathan Gettings to code together a rough product. Initially they were bankrolled entirely by Thiel, and the young team struggled to get investors or potential customers to take them seriously. ""How the hell do you get them to listen to 22-year-olds?"" says Lonsdale. ""We wanted someone to have a little more gray hair.""

Enter Karp, whose Krameresque brown curls, European wealth connections and Ph.D. masked his business inexperience. Despite his nonexistent tech background, the founders were struck by his ability to immediately grasp complex problems and translate them to nonengineers.

Lonsdale and Cohen quickly asked him to become acting CEO, and as they interviewed other candidates for the permanent job, none of the starched-collar Washington types or M.B.A.s they met impressed them. ""They were asking questions about our diagnostic of the total available market,"" says Karp, disdaining the B-school lingo. ""We were talking about building the most important company in the world.""

While Karp attracted some early European angel investors, American venture capitalists seemed allergic to the company. According to Karp, Sequoia Chairman Michael Moritz doodled through an entire meeting. A Kleiner Perkins exec lectured the Palantir founders on the inevitable failure of their company for an hour and a half.

**Palantir was rescued by a referral to In-Q-Tel, the CIA's venture arm**, which would make two rounds of investment totaling more than $2 million. ([See our sidebar on In-Q-Tel's greatest hits.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2013/08/14/meet-the-venture-arm-of-the-cia/)) ""They were clearly top-tier talent,"" says former In-Q-Tel executive Harsh Patel. ""The most impressive thing about the team was how focused they were on the problem ... how humans would talk with data.""

That mission turned out to be vastly more difficult than any of the founders had imagined. **PayPal had started with perfectly structured and organized information for its fraud analysis. Intelligence customers, by contrast, had mismatched collections of e-mails, recordings and spreadsheets.**

**To fulfill its privacy and security promises, Palantir needed to catalog and tag customers' data to ensure that only users with the right credentials could access it**. This need-to-know system meant classified information couldn't be seen by those without proper clearances--and was also designed to prevent the misuse of sensitive personal data.

But Palantir's central privacy and security protection would be what Karp calls, with his academic's love of jargon, ""the immutable log."" **Everything a user does in Palantir creates a trail that can be audited. No Russian spy, jealous husband or Edward Snowden can use the tool's abilities without leaving an indelible record of his or her actions.**

**From 2005 to 2008 the CIA was Palantir's patron and only customer, alpha-testing and evaluating its software.** But with Langley's imprimatur, word of Palantir's growing abilities spread, and the motley Californians began to bring in deals and recruits. The philosopher Karp turned out to have a unique ability to recognize and seduce star engineers. His colleagues were so flummoxed by his nose for technical talent that they once sent a pair of underwhelming applicants into a final interview with Karp as a test. He smelled both out immediately.

A unique Palantir culture began to form in Karp's iconoclast image. Its Palo Alto headquarters, which it calls ""the Shire"" in reference to the homeland of Tolkien's hobbits, features a conference room turned giant plastic ball pit and has floors littered with Nerf darts and dog hair. (Canines are welcome.) Staffers, most of whom choose to wear Palantir-branded apparel daily, spend so much time at the office that some leave their toothbrushes by the bathroom sinks.

**Karp himself remains the most eccentric of Palantir's eccentrics. The lifelong bachelor, who says that the notion of settling down and raising a family gives him ""hives,"" is known for his obsessive personality**: He solves Rubik's cubes in less than three minutes, swims and practices the meditative art of Qigong daily and has gone through aikido and jujitsu phases that involved putting cofounders in holds in the Shire's hallways. A cabinet in his office is stocked with vitamins, 20 pairs of identical swimming goggles and hand sanitizer. And he addresses his staff using an internal video channel called KarpTube, speaking on wide-ranging subjects like greed, integrity and Marxism. ""**The only time I'm not thinking about Palantir,"" he says, ""is when I'm swimming, practicing Qigong or during sexual activity.""**

**In 2010 Palantir's customers at the New York Police Department referred the company to JPMorgan, which would become its first commercial customer**. A team of engineers rented a Tribeca loft, sleeping in bunk beds and working around the clock to help untangle the bank's fraud problems. Soon they were given the task of unwinding its toxic mortgage portfolio. **Today Palantir's New York operation has expanded to a full, Batman-themed office known as Gotham, and its lucrative financial-services practice includes everything from predicting foreclosures to battling Chinese hackers.**

**As its customer base grew, however, cracks began to show in Palantir's idealistic culture**. **In early 2011 e-mails emerged that showed a Palantir engineer had collaborated on a proposal to deal with a WikiLeaks threat to spill documents from Bank of America. The Palantir staffer had eagerly agreed in the e-mails to propose tracking and identifying the group's donors, launching cyberattacks on WikiLeaks' infrastructure and even threatening its sympathizers.** When the scandal broke, Karp put the offending engineer on leave and issued a statement personally apologizing and pledging the company's support of ""progressive values and causes."" Outside counsel was retained to review the firm's actions and policies and, after some deliberation, determined it was acceptable to rehire the offending employee, much to the scorn of the company's critics.

Following the WikiLeaks incident, **Palantir's privacy and civil liberties team created an ethics hotline for engineers called the Batphone: Any engineer can use it to anonymously report to Palantir's directors work on behalf of a customer they consider unethical**. As the result of one Batphone communication, for instance, the company backed out of a job that involved analyzing information on public Facebook pages. Karp has also stated that Palantir turned down a chance to work with a tobacco firm, and overall the company walks away from as much as 20% of its possible revenue for ethical reasons. (It remains to be seen whether the company will be so picky if it becomes accountable to public shareholders and the demand for quarterly results.)

Still, according to former employees, Palantir has explored work in Saudi Arabia despite the staff's misgivings about human rights abuses in the kingdom. And for all Karp's emphasis on values, his apology for the WikiLeaks affair also doesn't seem to have left much of an impression in his memory. In his address to Palantir engineers in July he sounded defiant: ""We've never had a scandal that was really our fault.""

\*\*\*

**AT 4:07 P.M. ON NOV. 14, 2009** Michael Katz-Lacabe was parking his red Toyota Prius in the driveway of his home in the quiet Oakland suburb of San Leandro when a police car drove past. A license plate camera mounted on the squad car silently and routinely snapped a photo of the scene: his off-white, single-floor house, his wilted lawn and rosebushes, and his 5- and 8-year-old daughters jumping out of the car.

Katz-Lacabe, a gray-bearded and shaggy-haired member of the local school board, community activist and blogger, saw the photo only a year later: In 2010 he learned about the San Leandro Police Department's automatic license plate readers, designed to constantly photograph and track the movements of every car in the city. He filed a public records request for any images that included either of his two cars. The police sent back 112 photos. He found the one of his children most disturbing.

""Who knows how many other people's kids are captured in these images?"" he asks. His concerns go beyond a mere sense of parental protection. **""With this technology you can wind back the clock and see where everyone is, if they were parked at the house of someone other than their wife, a medical marijuana clinic, a Planned Parenthood center, a protest.""**

As Katz-Lacabe dug deeper, he found that the millions of pictures collected by San Leandro's license plate cameras are now passed on to the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center (NCRIC), one of 72 federally run intelligence fusion organizations set up after 9/11. That's where the photos are analyzed using software built by a company just across San Francisco Bay: Palantir.

In the business proposal that Palantir sent NCRIC, it offered customer references that included the Los Angeles and New York police departments, boasting that it enabled searches of the NYPD's 500 million plate photos in less than five seconds. Katz-Lacabe contacted Palantir about his privacy concerns, and the company responded by inviting him to its headquarters for a sit-down meeting. When he arrived at the Shire, a pair of employees gave him an hourlong presentation on Palantir's vaunted safeguards: its access controls, immutable logs and the Batphone.

Katz-Lacabe wasn't impressed. Palantir's software, he points out, has no default time limits--all information remains searchable for as long as it's stored on the customer's servers. And its auditing function? ""I don't think it means a damn thing,"" he says. ""Logs aren't useful unless someone is looking at them.""

When Karp hears Katz-Lacabe's story, he quickly parries: Palantir's software saves lives. ""Here's an actual use case,"" he says and launches into the story of a pedophile driving a ""beat-up Cadillac"" who was arrested within an hour of assaulting a child, thanks to NYPD license plate cameras. ""Because of the license-plate-reader data they gathered in our product, they pulled him off the street and saved human children lives.""

""If we as a democratic society believe that license plates in public trigger Fourth Amendment protections, our product can make sure you can't cross that line,"" he says, adding that there should be time limits on retaining such data. Until the law changes, though, Palantir will play within those rules. ""In the real world where we work--which is never perfect--you have to have trade-offs.""

And what if Palantir's audit logs--its central safeguard against abuse--are simply ignored? Karp responds that the logs are intended to be read by a third party. In the case of government agencies, he suggests an oversight body that reviews all surveillance--an institution that is purely theoretical at the moment. ""Something like this will exist,"" Karp insists. ""Societies will build it, precisely because the alternative is letting terrorism happen or losing all our liberties.""

Palantir's critics, unsurprisingly, aren't reassured by Karp's hypothetical court. Electronic Privacy Information Center activist Amie Stepanovich calls Palantir ""naive"" to expect the government to start policing its own use of technology. The Electronic Frontier Foundation's Lee Tien derides Karp's argument that privacy safeguards can be added to surveillance systems after the fact. ""You should think about what to do with the toxic waste while you're building the nuclear power plant,"" he argues, ""not some day in the future.""

**Some former Palantir staffers say they felt equally concerned about the potential rights violations their work enabled. ""You're building something that could absolutely be used for malice. It would have been a nightmare if J. Edgar Hoover had these capabilities in his crusade against Martin Luther King,"" says one former engineer. ""One thing that really troubled me was the concern that something I contribute to could prevent an Arab Spring-style revolution.""**

**Despite Palantir's lofty principles, says another former engineer, its day-to-day priorities are satisfying its police and intelligence customers: ""Keeping good relations with law enforcement** and 'keeping the lights on' bifurcate from the ideals.""

He goes on to argue that even Palantir's founders don't quite understand the Palantiri seeing stones in The Lord of the Rings . Tolkien's orbs, he points out, didn't actually give their holders honest insights. ""The Palantiri distort the truth,"" he says. And those who look into them, he adds, ""only see what they want to see.""

\*\*\*

**DESPITE WHAT** any critic says, it's clear that Alex Karp does indeed value privacy--his own.

His office, decorated with cardboard effigies of himself built by Palantir staff and a Lego fortress on a coffee table, overlooks Palo Alto's Alma Street through two-way mirrors. Each pane is fitted with a wired device resembling a white hockey puck. The gadgets, known as acoustic transducers, imperceptibly vibrate the glass with white noise to prevent eavesdropping techniques, such as bouncing lasers off windows to listen to conversations inside.

He's reminiscing about a more carefree time in his life--years before Palantir--and has put down his Rubik's cube to better gesticulate. ""I had $40,000 in the bank, and no one knew who I was. I loved it. I loved it. I just loved it. I just loved it!"" he says, his voice rising and his hands waving above his head. ""I would walk around, go into skanky places in Berlin all night. I'd talk to whoever would talk to me, occasionally go home with people, as often as I could. I went to places where people were doing things, smoking things. I just loved it.""

""One of the things I find really hard and view as a massive drag ... is that I'm losing my ability to be completely anonymous.""

It's not easy for a man in Karp's position to be a deviant in the modern world. And with tools like Palantir in the hands of the government, deviance may not be easy for the rest of us, either. With or without safeguards, the ""complete anonymity"" Karp savors may be a 20th-century luxury.

Karp lowers his arms, and the enthusiasm drains from his voice: ""I have to get over this.""",8,1770487446.0,Epstein,2,1.0,False

I am now completely heartbroken. We together decided to eat magic mushrooms together, I know…. probably not the best decision, but hey, I have had trips in the past and life works in weird fun ways.  my girlfriend never told me about ANY previous issues from childhood, so for all intents and purposes she is a completely sane, normal individual…. Or at least we thought or I thought?  We ate shrooms, ground them up in a coffee grinder and mixed them in juice, (it works well). About 45 minutes later my youngest son came home from god knows where. ( he’s 20) we gf and I retreated to my bedroom, what happens next is probably the worst/scariest/most horrific scenarios I could ever witness/take part of EVER!

  We retreat to said bedroom, and she proceeds to just mentally shut down.  Like check out.. like what the hell is happening, and should I call a medic type situation?!  I am trying to Be a good partner and help guide her from this ride that she wants to get off of, (we had talked prior about there is no way off this trail once it departs). That didn’t matter🫤 weird how drugs espesially hallucinogenics make you just forget all the shit!🤦‍♂️.  She becomes irate, like so incredibly irate that I am actually scared for her, she won’t let me touch her, won’t let me near her, and i, in my warped sense of thought,(I’m also high as balls). Fail to recognize that she is actually having a traumatic flashback from childhood… all the memories unlocked type situation.🤦‍♂️. after I figure out what’s happening, mind you I’m high and she’s not fucking talking I am able to calm her down and get her mildly out of her own brain.

  I calmly let her breathe and process, hug, say she’s safe, it’s ok, all the good boyfriend things…. She eventually comes off the ride and proceeds to actually finally tell me what’s happening, I am patient and calm. I listen. I understand, and I actually relate… because the same trauma happened to me as a child.

i begin to tentatively ask about some things, i reassure her shes safe.  I give room and listen to her pain.apparently, she was molested as a young child, and look identical to her perp….im shook and just hurt, i fucking love this woman, and would never in my life lay a harmful finger on her…I seriously thought she was the one. Everything in our entire relationship has been amazing and perfect.  She’s a social worker and in tune with her emotions, or so I thought! And able to articulate her feelings, it so I thought, like what the hell?!  I do understand that hallucinogenics can unlock past traumas. Repressed memories have no boundary, When it comes to shrooms.

 So here we are, two broken people, one that has worked through his shit on his own through years of alcohol and drug abuse. And another who has just figured out that her whole world just crumbled.  And I’m the perp… not really, shes actually older so the logistics and time frame just don’t work…. Only clarifying because people don’t actually read things. She told me last night that I look just like the man that accosted her, and that we’re done, and called me a pathological liar and various other things. My heart is broken, I know I did nothing wrong but i am just stuck here in limbo, loving a person that now can in her mind never love me back😢.    
  
  How do i move forward? This woman was just so amazing, she was the sweetest person and truly showed me real love in a way I haven’t experienced since I was in high school, you know, that puppy love shit. I’m just broken and need advice, please don’t comment with bullshit or snarky remarks.

As you know that our so called “Savior” AntiAi Friends thinks that ONLY genAi uses water and causes pollution but lets see it from the comparison because *we think rationally not emotionally as emotion does not sell.  As think with facts, not feelings — because emotion is a lousy salesman that folds under scrutiny.*

 

Ok lets start , uhm in this I am not compare with coffee , cotton , hamburger , internet ,cars and foods as for them it is an necessity . Ok, lets  believe it and Ai Arts are wastage of time as it has no benefits to SOCIETY . So does the traditional Arts Cure CANCER, Diseases, Wars and other socio problems ? Even Worsed they pollute our environment

So called Your “Pencil” which is used to make an arts? How do you think? What it is made up ? Let Me tell you as you can not notice from your naked eyes .  
   
   1. Lead – Which is the Mixture of **graphite** and **clay .**

 Graphite -> It is non renewable Resource  
A. Mining  
Graphite is mined (often in China, Brazil, or Mexico), a process that can cause significant dust pollution and soil contamination.

B. The Kiln  
he graphite and clay are ground into a fine powder, mixed with water, and then fired in a kiln at roughly **1,000°C (1,800°F) (Source :** [**https://www.thepencompany.com/blog/pencils/how-a-wooden-pencil-is-made/**](https://www.thepencompany.com/blog/pencils/how-a-wooden-pencil-is-made/) **)**

Bro that is 1000 C , just imagine the temperature and the pollution it is going to pollute 🤣

C. Fryer

 After firing, the cores are often soaked in **hot wax or oil** to make them write smoothly.

 

2. Wood ?

 What is the most valuable resource in the universe ? Fun Fact , That is the Tree

So How it is going to use it in making pencil ?

The Slat :  
Wood (usually Incense Cedar from California or Poplar from China/India) is cut into thin slats. (Source : [https://www.interwell.cn/how-pencils-are-made-a-detailed-production-process-guide#:\~:text=Their%20primary%20components%2C%20graphite%2C%20and,2](https://www.interwell.cn/how-pencils-are-made-a-detailed-production-process-guide#:~:text=Their%20primary%20components%2C%20graphite%2C%20and,2) )

  **Chemical Treatment:** These slats are **waxed, stained, and kiln-dried** again to prevent warping and make them easier to sharpen. So how it polluting ?

  **Leaching into Soil & Water:** When treated wood waste (shavings or discarded pencils) ends up in a landfill, the heavy metals (Zinc, Copper) and synthetic dyes leach out. These chemicals can contaminate groundwater and harm soil microbes.

**The Energy of the Kiln:** To ""force"" these chemicals into the wood, slats are placed in pressure tanks and then dried in industrial kilns for **16 to 23 days** at high temperatures. This is a massive, continuous draw on the energy grid and far longer than **the seconds it takes to generate an AI image.  . Yes My Dear Friend It uses more energy to create ONE ART**

**The Grooving:** Industrial saws carve 8-9 parallel grooves into two slats. The graphite cores are laid in the grooves of the bottom slat, glue is applied, and the top slat is ""sandwiched"" on under **1,000 kg of pressure**.

 

* Last Finishing **Lacquer:** Most pencils are coated in **5 to 8 layers of paint** (lacquer) to give them that smooth yellow or black finish.
* **The Ferrule:** That little metal ring is **aluminum**, which is extremely energy-intensive to smelt.
* **The Eraser:** Usually made of **synthetic rubber** (petroleum-based) and **pumice** (mined volcanic rock).

 

And yess . if your art get messed up then , yes the cycle will restart  as that paper goes in the trash. **It is permanent material waste.**

 

**2. Paper ( One of the core part )**

Paper: Producing one A4 sheet uses 2-13 liters of water (average \~10L per sheet, per Water Footprint Network and multiple studies). That's deforestation for pulp (contributing to habitat loss and CO2 release), plus chemical pollution from bleaching.

3. Paints/Brushes: Pigments from mined minerals (cadmium, lead—toxic runoff into rivers). Brushes often use animal hair or synthetic fibers from petroleum.

 

And Now overall :  
The supply chain for a single sketchpad involves global shipping, energy-intensive factories, and irreversible resource depletion. One ton of paper requires 400,000+ liters of water and emits \~**1.5-2 tons of CO2.**

 

**Ok Now Compare with our Ai Arts So Called Pollution Factory ooh wait how I forget about the Factories . There are more Factories of manufacture of Pencil and paper than AI DATA CENTER**

 

**AI : Generating one image uses 0.01-0.29 kWh (typically 0.05-0.2 kWh for models like Stable Diffusion or DALL-E, per 2024 estimates from Hugging Face and MIT Tech Review).**

Lets See with all the Models

  Low end: Efficient open-source models (e.g., LCM or optimized Stable Diffusion) → \~0.000086–0.001 kWh.

 Mid-range (common for Stable Diffusion, Flux, etc.): **0.05–0.2 kWh** (your original range holds up well; many 2024–2025 benchmarks fall here).

High end: Cloud-based high-quality (e.g., DALL-E 3, Midjourney v6, or 50+ steps at high res) → up to 0.3–2 kWh in worst cases, but usually 0.1–0.5 kWh.

One A4 Sheet of Paper (about 5 grams, normal office or art paper)

Energy needed to make one sheet is roughly 0.0125 to 0.05 kWh.

A commonly used estimate is around 12.5 watt-hours (0.0125 kWh) per A4 sheet.

* This comes from European averages where about 500 kWh is used to produce 200 kg of paper, which works out to one 5 g sheet.

Some studies give higher numbers, going up to around 50 Wh (0.05 kWh) if you include more steps like heavy drying, processing, and transport.

This is only for *manufacturing*, not usage.

Making paper from virgin pulp takes a lot of energy because of pulping, bleaching, and drying.

Recycled paper reduces energy use, but virgin paper is still widely used, so the overall impact remains high.

One Pencil (standard wooden graphite pencil)

The direct factory energy to assemble one pencil is very small, usually less than 0.01 kWh.

Some life-cycle studies mention tiny values like 0.4 to 1.3 watt-hours forassembly and packaging.

However, when you look at the full lifecycle, the energy use is much higher.

This includes:

Cutting and transporting wood

Mining and processing graphite

Baking graphite-clay cores at very high temperatures (often above 800°C)

Global transport and shipping

There isn’t one exact public number for energy per pencil.

Graphite mining and refining uses a lot of energy.

Logging and hauling wood uses diesel fuel.

The core baking process uses high heat and electricity.

Some comparisons show that recycled-paper pencils save about 225 kWh compared to virgin-wood pencils when averaged across large production, which suggests virgin pencils carry significant embedded energy.

Overall comparisons show wooden pencils use similar or slightly less energy than plastic or paper pencils, but they are still far from “free” energy-wise.

A reasonable estimate for total per-pencil energy (manufacturing + upstream) is somewhere in the 0.01 to 0.1 kWh range, though this is less precise than paper estimates.

 

 

But, You all are going to say that about ai training consumes more energy ? That is Training is a one-time cost (e.g., GPT-4's \~50 GWh, equivalent to 1,000 homes for a year), but it's amortized over billions of images. Per-image emissions drop to grams of CO2e. Traditional art? Every new canvas or tube of paint repeats the extraction cycle forever.

Any more …

Traditional's Stuck: ""Greening"" extraction? Mining for graphite or pigments still scars landscapes (e.g., artisanal mining causes deforestation in Zimbabwe, per studies)

And if you are commenting Paper are recycle then but virgin paper demand drives logging (8-11% of global deforestation). **You can't ""renewable"" a mine**

Anti love topic by the anti ai friends  
Idata centers do use water (e.g., 300k-5M gallons/day per large center for cooling), but innovations like closed-loop systems cut this by 70-90%. Compare to agriculture (70% of global water use) or paper mills (324L/kg paper). **And AI's total US water use? \~0.3% of public supply—tiny vs. traditional industries.**

 

**I even not mentioned that take account of human energy wastage , time factors and so on…**

And For your kind information **atleast we are trying to make ai arts more efficient**  
Google’s AI unit *DeepMind* has used AI to *reduce data-center cooling energy consumption by up to* *40 %* — significantly lowering power use and related emissions. Google also designs its custom AI chips (TPUs) that are far more energy-efficient per computation than general-purpose GPUs

Microsoft’s cloud platform uses *carbon-aware computing* — shifting workloads to times and regions with cleaner energy — and the company has committed to being carbon negative by 2030 while optimizing energy use in data centers.

Nvidia, one of the biggest providers of AI processors, has focused on *more efficient GPU designs* and power-limiting features to reduce energy use. It also targets *100 % renewable electricity* for offices and controlled data centers as part of its sustainability goals

Data-center provider Equinix has committed to making its data centers *climate neutral by 2030* and expanded sustainability programs like heat reuse, supporting lower-impact AI operations.

Exowatt is a startup backed by tech investors aiming to *supply renewable and reliable energy for AI data centers*, helping reduce dependence on fossil fuels that cause pollution

1qykpkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1qykpkl/how_to_be_disgustingly_educated_in_2025_the/,"How to Be ""Disgustingly Educated"" in 2025: The Psychology of Building a SEXY Brain","Look, I've spent the last 18 months basically turning myself into a knowledge sponge. Not because I wanted to flex at dinner parties (though that's a nice side effect), but because I realized how mentally fucking sluggish I'd become. Scrolling TikTok, consuming garbage content, feeling stupid in conversations. The average person reads less than 1 book per year after college. Wild right?

Here's what nobody tells you: being educated isn't about memorizing facts or collecting degrees. It's about building a framework for understanding literally everything around you. Psychology, economics, history, philosophy, the whole thing. I pulled this from books, research papers, podcasts, YouTube lectures. Basically became a knowledge goblin.

And yeah, our education system kinda sets us up to fail here. School teaches us WHAT to think, not HOW to think. Plus our brains are literally rewired for dopamine hits now thanks to social media algorithms. Neuroplasticity works both ways unfortunately.

Anyway, here's what actually worked:

1. read like your brain depends on it (because it does)

Start with 20 pages a day. That's it. Sounds pathetically small but it compounds to 30+ books yearly. The trick is reading GOOD shit, not self help fluff that repeats the same 3 ideas for 300 pages.

Grab Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. Nobel prize winner, basically revolutionized behavioral economics. This book will make you question every decision you've ever made. It breaks down how your brain actually works, the cognitive biases screwing you over daily, why you're irrational as hell but think you're logical. Insanely good read. Best psychology book I've ever touched.

Also [Sapiens](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095) by Yuval Noah Harari. This one gives you the entire human story, from irrelevant apes to gods of creation. Helps you understand why society operates the way it does, why we believe the things we believe. After reading this you'll see patterns everywhere.

2. consume knowledge like you're building a mental model

Your brain isn't a hard drive, it's a network. Everything needs to connect. When you learn something new, immediately ask ""how does this relate to what i already know?""

The podcast ""Huberman Lab"" is perfect for this. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscience professor at Stanford, breaks down complex science into actually useful protocols. Episodes on learning, sleep, dopamine. He explains the mechanisms behind everything so you understand WHY things work.

3. use spaced repetition (this is non negotiable)

Your brain forgets like 70% of what you learn within 24 hours unless you review it. Use apps that force you to revisit information.

Download Readwise . It resurfaces highlights from books/articles you've read. Sounds simple but it's genuinely life changing. You actually RETAIN what you read instead of finishing a book and remembering basically nothing 2 weeks later.

Also get into Anki for anything you want to permanently remember. Yeah it's a bit tedious but medical students use it to memorize thousands of concepts. Works.

If you want something more engaging that actually connects all these dots for you, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/app/befreed/id6448975969) . It's an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google that pulls from books, research papers, expert talks, and more to create personalized audio podcasts based on your specific goals.

You can literally type something like ""I want to become disgustingly educated but struggle with retention and connecting ideas"" and it generates a structured learning plan just for you, complete with customizable depth (10-min summaries or 40-min deep dives). The adaptive plan evolves based on what you highlight and how you interact with it. Plus you get a virtual coach that captures your insights automatically so you don't lose those random ""aha"" moments. Makes learning way more addictive than doomscrolling.

4. learn frameworks not facts

Mental models are your cheat code. They let you understand new situations instantly because you recognize underlying patterns.

Read Poor Charlie's Almanack about Charlie Munger. Dude literally collected mental models from every discipline, physics, biology, psychology, economics, used them to become one of the most successful investors ever. The book teaches you to think in systems.

Key models to start: first principles thinking (break problems to fundamentals) second order thinking (consider consequences of consequences) inversion (solve problems backward) occam's razor (simplest explanation usually correct)

5. actually write about what you learn

This forces clarity. If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it.

Start a notion page or private blog. After finishing a book or podcast, write 3 key takeaways and how you'll apply them. Takes 10 mins max but cements the knowledge.

6. cross pollinate knowledge areas

The most interesting insights happen at intersections. Psychology + economics = behavioral economics. Biology + computers = AI.

[Range](https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484) by David Epstein destroys the myth of specialization. Shows how generalists actually outperform specialists in complex unpredictable fields. The book profiles people who succeeded BECAUSE they had diverse knowledge, not despite it.

7. build a second brain system

You can't remember everything, so don't try. Capture ideas immediately.

Use Notion or Obsidian to create a personal knowledge management system. Tag everything, link related concepts. When you need information later, you know exactly where it lives.

8. listen at 1.5-2x speed

Podcasts and audiobooks at normal speed feel painfully slow once you adjust. You can consume 2x the content in the same time. Your brain adapts within like 3 days.

Lex Fridman podcast is gold for this. He interviews scientists, philosophers, historians. Super long form, deep conversations. Speed it up and you're basically getting MIT level education for free.

9. teach what you learn

Explaining concepts to others reveals gaps in your understanding instantly. Even if it's just explaining to a friend over coffee or posting on reddit.

The Feynman technique: pick a concept, explain it to a 12 year old, identify gaps in your explanation, go back and relearn those parts.

10. curate your inputs obsessively

Your brain is shaped by what you feed it. Garbage in, garbage out.

Unfollow everyone posting rage bait and doom scrolling content. Follow scientists, authors, thinkers. Make your feed actually educational.

Use Matter or Instapaper to save quality articles, read them properly later instead of skimming while distracted.

The compound effect here is insane. 6 months of this and you'll notice you understand conversations differently. Patterns emerge everywhere. You connect dots others miss.

Your brain literally restructures itself through neuroplasticity. The more you learn, the easier learning becomes. It's like compound interest for your mind.

Being educated isn't about showing off or collecting credentials. It's about seeing reality more clearly, making better decisions, understanding why things happen. It makes literally everything in life more interesting.

Start small. 20 pages today. One podcast episode. Write 3 sentences about what you learned.

1qykpdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/1qykpdc/i_think_leftwingers_sometimes_grift_on_dating/,"I think left-wingers sometimes ""grift"" on dating difficulties too.","One of the things about the manosphere is that it can have a ""grifty"" or ""ragebaiting"" side to it, like the sense that some people are trying to sell you a product or ideology and not necessarily fix anything. Even as someone who has become critical of some left-wing ideas over the years, I still cringe at the idea of someone just making an ""SJW cringe compilation"" like it's the early 2010s.

Even in good faith, the manosphere is overrun with dating courses, books, and so on. However, I still feel like manosphere opponents and left-wingers sometimes use dating discussions for their own issues and ends too, usually to complain about the economy, capitalism, or conservative attitudes in men.

**Women are turned off by men drifting right.**

This can make sense on an individual level. If a given woman doesn't really feel like the climate is good enough for her to date men, that's fine. I do agree that some men may have become more conservative within the past 10-20 years.

However, the idea that misogyny or political conservatism turns off women cannot really explain the shift in dating on a generational scale, because I think liberal politics is still in a better place than it was decades ago, and even conservatives today are more liberal than conservatives decades ago.

If modern men are too sexist, if modern politics is too toxic and misogynist, if male conservatism is just too much of a turnoff, then what *previous* era was better?

Pre 2017 means you are pre-MeToo. MeToo seemed to fall short of expectations and got a backlash, but I'd say it was a net positive for raising awareness and exposure. Going back pre-2015 means you are pre-Obergefell (the gay marriage Supreme Court case, probably one of the biggest progressive victories in my lifetime). When I was a kid transphobic and homophobic slurs were so common I didn't even know they were slurs. HIV went from something with the stigma of a Biblical plague (literally in some people's eyes) to something that can be treated to a point where it's not transmissible, and I know this because I see commercials openly advertising HIV medications with happy gay people in them. This is an entirely different world than even the 2000s.

The 90s also brings us the Violence Against Women Act, and in previous decades you have Title IX and the Equal Pay Act. I don't really see how, on a generational level, dating as a woman would have been better in the 80s versus the 2000s, or why the 2000s would have been better than the 2020s. A lot of conservatives might mock WNBA athletes for wanting equal pay, but that's a bit far off from actually opposing anti-discrimination laws for the average person.

Even conservatism has gotten more progressive in some interesting ways. Interracial relationships used to be literally illegal. Now, one of the ways racism manifests is *encouraging* men to date internationally and interracially, but for sketchy reasons (i.e. fetishizing a different culture as ""less corrupted than The West"", or having more financial power over a poorer person). Men who have an ""All men pay eventually."" attitude towards dating are, in their own way, supportive of sex workers. Parts of the manosphere that oppose pornography generally do so in terms of self-control and enlightenment grounds: they don't seem to want to ban it outright.

Even the quest for casual sex, something openly pursued and desired within the manosphere, would have been wildly unacceptable in previous generations. A passport bro influencer who wants to have casual sex with women in the Philippines might have very well been killed for their beliefs in previous eras, and yet they are also ""far-right"" by today's standards.

Also, there is the elephant in the room that women are not a political monolith. There are literally millions of conservative women, and even liberal women might not have fighting rape culture, the wage gap, or reproductive rights as their #1 issues.

**Late Capitalism is making it harder to date!**

I get it. Stuff is expensive, inflation vs. wages, ""enshittification"", and all that stuff. However, you cannot tell me that the person with the bachelor's degree at Starbucks works a harder or more financially unstable life than an 19th century factory worker or medieval peasant. Is a minimum wage worker who lives with their parents really worse off than a farmer who can starve to death if it happens to rain less this year? Is the idea of cuts to Social Security really more insecure than a time and place with no government programs at all?

Human beings had sex with each other as hunter-gatherers. Human beings had sex with each other in early agriculture, before we mastered it, when food was less delicious and nutritious because we hadn't selectively bred it for literally thousands of years. Human beings had sex with each other for thousands of years McDonald's stopped being cheap.

Indeed, complaining about fast food getting more expensive is a subtle point: before fast food, basically every meal would have to be meal-prepped or handmade. Even as the ""convenient"" aspects of modern life become less convenient, they still offer advantages over the past in some ways.

The overwhelmingly vast majority of people across all human history were poor. Even the leader of something like a nomadic tribe might be ""poor"" by the standards of the first-world middle class. Someone who can store all their possessions on a few horses or a wagon could be on the material level of someone who lives out of a van. That person is ""poorer"" than a lot of people who claim that modern working life creates too much financial stress or time crunch to date.

Yes, modern economics suck for a lot of people, but it can't suck so much that a basic human function is impeded.

**There's nowhere to go without having to spend money.**

This is a good but ultimately overrated point. Does it suck that you have to buy coffee to hang out in a coffee shop? I guess, but at the same time, people can literally hang out for hours if it's not busy and you're not bothering someone. In fact, one tactic I've even seen homeless people do is that they will do something like buy a single item in a store as a justified way to take shelter from bad weather for a while. 

Even if there are not ""free third places"" anymore, what exactly would be free that a lot of people you're attracted to would want to go to anyway? You might like concerts but if you want to meet people in the concert scene it costs money, and that's money you'd be spending to go to concerts if you were trying to date or not.

**Housing is too expensive and it's harder to date when you don't have your own place.**

The idea that you must be some kind of independently wealthy landowner to be dateable and have a sex life is weirdly regressive thing to imply. Communal living and multi-generational households are not some recession indicator or universal sexual turnoff. This is how a lot of people just normally lived throughout history.

The idea that you need to ""move out"" to ""launch"" or ""be an adult"" or ""be ready"" or ""be put together"" is a very specific cultural norm that wasn't necessary for the vast majority of times and places where humans have had sex with each other.",1,1770487402.0,PurplePillDebate,7,0.67,False
1qykp69,https://www.reddit.com/r/tamilyapping/comments/1qykp69/money_is_a_always_ultimate/,Money is a always ultimate,"hi all, good evening hope everyone's doing well. first things first I'm not a person who is after money but everyone around me tends to respect me on how much i have in my pocket. 

a little bit about me - 31 Male Indian living in chennai. don't drink, don't smoke, don't have any bad habits, don't drink tea or coffee also. somewhat like Anniyan movie ambi but won't talk rules and shit, but will try to be correct in what I'm doing. my father passed away in  Jan 2017. so we are a family of three me, my mother and sister. 

i have been working from my college days and always gave money for my family. to the point where I would not even spend money on myself while my mother is a spendthrift (someone who lashes out money to churches in the name of believe) in tens of thousands every month. We can't question her on anything whatever she says is the rule, we should eat what she gives, drink what she tells us to drink, have friends only if she approves, can't marry the girl who i might love because they are poor. she only wants me to marry a rich girl. 

p.s - i want to marry a girl who i like and someone who will treat my family like her family. 

my mother has personally destroyed my marriage and my mental health several times. i can't marry a girl of a different caste, i can't marry a girl from the same caste (if they are poor). 

basically life is shit. my sister is like at the verge of losing it. like she asks questions like what's the point of living etc., 

my mother will go to school, then go to church and then finally come to home only by 8-9 o clock in the night. 

so coming back to my saving habit i save a lot. i have saved some 45 lakhs in 2 years in uk. i have sent all that money to my sister's account and kept some in my account couldn't send money to my mother's account since she think if i send her some money under 10 lakhs police will catch her for having a huge amount being deposited into her account, but i told her it gives me happiness to send her money, i will send in a few lakhs, but she refused. so finally, i had to send it to my account. 

During this period in the UK i injured my knee (due to walking 180 kms per week 30 kms per day for 6 days in a week, from warehouse job) and due to the injury i can't walk for more than 15 minutes. it starts to pain due to tendonitis + calcium deficiency. so i had returned from UK and was unable to walk properly also and taking treatment and within a month of coming to India even before treatment has started my mother told me to search for a job. i told her I am not in a position to work presently please understand, but my mother doesn't listen and keeps mocking me for not getting a job and i have started looking for remote jobs as it will help me to work from home, but Inbetween she will mock for not getting a job. For reference i came to India in September 2025 and now I am looking for jobs and but gods grace hoping to get it soon. but still the mocking continues. that's when i realised poor people like me never get off days till the day I go to the grave. 

some of the things which my mother believes are

\- if she gets any random emails to her email police are going to catch her and she will start questioning me did you give my email ID. 

\- will ask me to look for a house to buy and then say how can I trust a new person and buy a house or land. (more complications in this i don't want to confuse you)

\- she asked me for a trust worthy way to invest money in gold. i told her to buy from MMTC PAMP. i meet her every condition which she laid but she coldly refused saying i don't belive you, then she asked a person buying gold from there then she got the trust to buy from them in a minute. this trust issues is with everyone in the family but Blindly trusts outsiders. 

\- has kept boiling rod on my back during my sleep (after telling me to sleep without shirt) for smiling at a girl i know from tution. never allowed me to talk to any girls. 

\- tries to marry me of any rich girl who has an affair with a guy as she is talking to me or tries to match me up to a mad girl just because they have a house. 

- my mother will not invest or let me invest my money anywhere but keep it in a bank. Just because she said so. 

- many things are happening i feel like running away from all this please help me. 

i don't know if any of this is normal. please guide me. Please pray for me thank you. 

so any suggestions or advice would be better what should I do moving forward. cause everyday seems to be a struggle. please help me. 

all that being said and done ultimately she is my mother and i can't change it. please guide me in what I can do to make things right and live happily in my life.

Another example was when I had a super annoying coworker who asked me how my weekend was every Monday and made chit chat with me at every opportunity. I didn't want to risk hurting his feelings because I was too afraid, but I wanted to send him an email saying, ""I'm not sure if you only like me platonically and you're just being friendly, or if you're flirting with me and trying to get in my pants, but either way, I am seriously not interested. 

Again, I was told that's unprofessional because of how direct it is. 

My brain literally interprets being direct as kindness. Why would you not want me to be honest with you?? I dislike how being direct with people makes me aggressive. Sorry for knowing what I want Karen...I don’t get why other people never say what they actually mean, but when I’m direct, I’m considered rude.

 

Having to do this EVERY FUCKING DAY WITH EVERY SINGLE PERSON:

Hi how are you?

I'm good, how are you?

I'm good.

CAN'T WE JUST SMILE AND WAVE AT EACH OTHER? We’re always supposed to reply “good” or “fine” to “How are you?”. Why can people just say “Hi” or “What’s up?” instead of “How are you” if they don’t actually want to know how we’re doing?

 

The fact that it's perfectly acceptable to get somebody's hopes up for nothing, say that you're going to do something and then don’t stick to your commitments. 

Apparently, it's weird if someone says, ""We should go to this place/do this activity sometime."" And I start actively trying to set a day and time in stone for us to go there or do that. If you didn't mean it, then why offer? Now I’m the annoying weirdo for actually believing what you said? Yeah okay. Hahaha “We should \_\_\_\_\_ soon!” when that person had no intention of doing that thing with you. And it’s considered “annoying” or “creepy” to follow up and try to schedule a date with them. 

Two good examples of this: There was this girl I went to high school with and we were more acquaintances, not exactly friends. We kept in contact on social media and over the phone and would chat every now and then. 

I asked her if she'd be interested in going to the county fair with me and she said, ""Sure!"" I texted/messaged her on Facebook multiple times asking her what day works best for her. No reply. Then after a certain number of attempts to get her to set a day in stone she blocked me. 8 months after I invited her I tried calling her off a different # and she hung up immediately. I waited 3-4 months after that and sent her a text asking her where I went wrong and got no explanation, just a text back from her saying, ""Delete this number."" 

Example #2, there was someone on my friends list who I know had a Sea World pass, I asked her if she would be interested in going with me and she said yes. When I wished her a happy birthday, she said, ""Thanks for the birthday wishes! A Sea World trip is in the future! She worked the same exact hours on the same exact days every week so it's not like she had some crazy unpredictable life. Every time I attempted to set a day in stone for us to go, she always blew me off. 

Like daaaaaaamn sorry for misunderstanding, I actually enjoy socializing.

Saying “Yes we should absolutely make plans together soon” or “Yes, I will approve your friend request on Facebook” just to be polite and make THEMSELVES comfortable. They have no intention of making plans or approving my friend request and if I message them, I get ghosted.

If you don't like me, just say it. I don't understand being fake friendly. I believe everything you say because why would I assume you are lying?

 

Having to maintain constant back & forth communication and contacting friends just to “check in” in order to maintain a friendship.

A good example of this is this guy who I used to deliver mail to when I worked at the post office. He was married and trying to get in my pants, but I only liked him platonically. I didn't mind exchanging numbers with him and was open to the idea of grabbing a cup of coffee with him.

He sent me a text one day saying, ""This will be my last text to you based on your non-replies to me.""

I texted him back saying, ""If I offended you, I'm sorry. It's not you, it's me. No hard feelings k?"" 

If that were the only time that happened, fine, but whenever I wouldn't get as responsive as he wanted he would text me stuff like, ""Why am I losing you? Did I do something wrong?"" And he would literally text me EVERY SINGLE DAY. 



SMALL TALK. I HATE this shit. Be for real you don't give a fuck how my day‘s going if you're an employee and I’m a customer. I like being quiet and minding my business, why do I have to talk about my weekend, my holiday or what I had for lunch to make you feel comfortable?! So tired of small talk, my dude. Let’s talk about if you’ve ever done psychedelics and if you have what it was like, whether or not aliens exist or movies or music or politics. Not how my weekend or holiday was or what I had for lunch. 🙄

 

The question “What do you do.” I don’t care what you do for a job or what your title is as long as you are a decent human being. If you’re a CEO, a lawyer or a surgeon, to quote the great Shania Twain, “That don’t impress me much.”

 

Why do I have to be nice to people when they're being a dick to me? They started it. No, I don't want to kill them with kindness.",2,1770487362.0,autism,4,1.0,False
1qyko5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/suzerain/comments/1qyko5w/lunch_with_the_lt_anton_rayne_31_patch_update/,Lunch with the LT - Anton Rayne (3.1. Patch Update),"A while ago I posted an interview with my cannon Anton. I played Suzerain again for 3.1. and here's the updated story. I think I'll do another one of these for my canon Rizia playthrough.

**Anton Rayne: Having won re-election together with Petr Vectern on a platform of continuity, our president faces a new term under a minority government.**

[Anton Rayne - President of Sordland and Chairman of the USP](https://preview.redd.it/90gpiq6hv3ig1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65c5c1cc25563c75f902df4f6e8b6d033c2fcb60)

As he excuses himself through the crowded entrance of Zuco's, a small Bergian restaurant near the Maroon Palace popular with working men for its cheapness, I cannot help but think of how unlikely a figure Anton Rayne cuts as the most powerful man in Sordland. The Deyr-born Anton, only child of a farmer couple who spent his childhood among wheat fields, has comfortably won re-election after overseeing the country's return to prosperity during his first term. This helps explain the man's sky-high approval ratings, rivaling Soll's at his peak, but does not do so entirely. Gazing at the constant stream of shoulder taps and friendly call-outs he receives as he sits at the lunch table accompanied by his driver Serge, who makes no ceremony, I can witness first-hand his characteristic cheeriness and humility that voters find so appealing.

His job this time around feels much easier though. At the start of his term, Sordland's problems were many: economic recession, crumbling infrastructure, an overburdened welfare system, distrust in the government, organized crime, Rumburgian encroachment, political assassinations, to name a few. He had probably assumed the toughest job on Merkopa, but felt undeterred at the time. Rayne, in his wrinkled dark suit, flashes a big smile when I laid this out to him. ""I didn't do it alone."" He remarks, as a waiter leaves two cups of kebij on the table. ""I was fortunate to count with a team of passionate and skilled people.""

His cabinet had been an odd selection, containing all political shades within the USP and some wild cards. After the collapse of the Ewald administration, Rayne was the only senior figure within the party that had positive polling and his centrist views made it easier for the whole party to rally around. For the USP leadership, it was clear that Rayne was their only shot at retaining control and they were proved right. ""While most of my colleagues spent their time debating ideologies and pointing fingers at each other, I took to the streets, I talked to my constituents. There was anger, craving for change. And they were right."" He won on platform of Sollist unity, the halting of privatizations, tightening of immigration, democratic reform of all government brances, anti-corruption and bottom-up economic intervention.

***""Some of my colleagues pushed for the banning of the Red Youth and Young Sords. I don't agree with their ideologies, but they have a right to speak and I, as president, have a duty to listen.""***

Rayne's tenure started with a huge challenge. Bernard Circas, communist MP, was shot dead by a Young Sord terrorist, plunging the nation into another crisis as riots and skirmishes spread through the streets at the height of the economic recession. Rayne is credited with the swift ending of the violence through his constant media presence and calming demeanour, with his reconciliatory speech at Cricas' funeral seen as a focal point. A former Young Sord speaking in warming tones at such a renowned communist's funeral marked a turning point for many. ""It certainly was contentious..."" Rayne turned pensive for a moment. ""I grew up in a Sordish settler community in Deyr, as you may know, so nationalism was part of daily life in my household. But love for one's country does not imply the need for violence, the violence I witness in Luderin's coup. I tried to convey that at Circas' funeral.

His efforts were not words alone though. Rayne worked with the assembly to establish enact the Workers' Rights Act, establishing the current SR2.5/hour minimum wage and greatly increasing worker rights and protections, after which several union and Red Youth leaders called for restraint publicly. ""Some of my colleagues pushed for the banning of the Red Youth and Young Sords. I don't agree with their ideologies, but they have a right to speak and I, as president, had a duty to listen.""

***""We will not be dismantling the ACP during my second term and will continue to root out the rot wherever it is."" Even within the USP? I asked. ""Wherever it is.""***

""Change was in the air... We had to be ambitious."" His ambitious platform was fully implemented, with the constitutional reform being his mandate's main achievement. A lthe removal of the Supreme Court's influence in further constitutional amendments, term limits, removal of the Justices' immunity and presidential absolute veto were the main changes. Reforms thought unthinkable mere years ago. ""I thank my brothers and sisters in the Supreme Court. Nia and Mrs. Edwards were crucial, and I thank Mr. Garaci for his flexibility and his help with Hawker's impeachment."" The latter was followed by the appointment of Ovid Greecer and his appointment as Chief Justice.

The reforms were well received within the public, and most legal scholars agree that they established a much improved separation of powers, but critics point to the preservation of the 10% vote threshold, strong presidential decrees and the Member of Honor status (albeit without legal immunity) as undemocratic sollist remnants. ""We need governability. What Sords want above all else is action."" Anton stubbornly rebuted. ""and they believe remarkable people like the Colonel deserve to be rewarded.""

The government also oversaw a big allocation of resources to the Justice Ministry, reforming the judicial process and enacting an extensive anti-corruption campaign with the formation of the Anti-Corruption Police. ""But we couldn't stop there."" Rayne added. ""I couldn't exit my office without some oligarch accosting me for some favor."" He was, of course, referencing the ACP's arrests of Walter Tusk, major shareholder of Bergia Steel, and Marcel Koronti, owner and CEO of HOS. These were accompanied by hundreds of other organised crime-linked arrests and thousands of firearm aprehensions. The notorious ""Skinner"" and ""Koranelli"" gangs were, for the most part, dismantled, but Rayne is still not satisfied. ""But I know the rot goes deeper. We will not be dismantling the ACP during my second term and will continue to root out the rot wherever it is."" Even within the USP? I asked. ""Wherever it is.""

**Menu:**

* Kebij cup x2 SR7
* Zabla SR6.7
* Sordish stew SR6.5
* Espresso x2 SR6
* Rivian red wine cup x2 - on the house

It was then that the plates arrived. Zabla for Anton, one of his favorites, while I ordered the ""dish of the day"": Sordish stew. Zuco himself carried the plates, bringing also an opened bottle of Rivian red (the most expensive wine the humble restaurant had) offering us a cup each on the house. After a heated back and forth between Rayne and our patron, who talked with the president on first-name terms, it was agreed that we would not pay for the cups but Rayne would be leaving a generous tip. ""This man is more stubborn than my old mule."" He complained. No stranger to poverty, Rayne takes pride in his humble background prior to becoming a foreign policy assistant within the USP.

""Nothing better than a 100% Sordish meal eh?"" Rayne remarked with a satisfied grin. His mandate had overseen an extensive investment in Sordland's agricultural industry through agricultural subisidies, tax incentives and the establishment of dozens of rural education institutes across the Sordish country side. But the administration's crown jewel was the SSC-overseen Sarna Agricultural Zone project, which remade the unremarkable city of Sarna into Sordland's breadbasket. ""My Sarnish in-laws have a small shrine to Anton by their bed!"" Serge remarked, unprompted. Anton shook his head as he chuckled: ""Tell your in-laws not to blaspheme, for God's sake!""

***""For too long our rural communities were forgotten. Under my leadership, the government will prioritise the forgotten: the small farm owner, the civil servant, the soldier! Not the already rich and powerful.""***

The agricultural sector's expansion played a key role in the economic recovery Rayne oversaw, but his administration's secondary focus on Agnland was also a big contributor. The building of the H3 highway and other minor infrastructure projects along with the expansion of a generous trade deal with Agnolia turned what was Sordland's backwater province into a vibrant node for trade, fishing industry and tourism. ""Those are my brothers Symon and Gus' merits. They wanted me to focus on the big cities but I pointed them to the countryside. I want to put an end to the poverty and neglect I felt growing up.""

But that focus has arguably shifted precious resources away from the most productive cores of Sordland. ""That was precisely the goal!"" Rayne retorted. ""For too long our rural communities were forgotten. Under my leadership, the government will prioritise the forgotten: the small farm owner, the civil servant, the soldier! Not the already rich and powerful."" Under his tenure, Bergia and Agnland now account for c. 32% of total Sordish GDP, up from c. 12%. ""And my economic revival was done with sustainability in mind. The G.R.E.E.N. Act is essential in maintaining our environment and eco-friendly practices.""

The cheaper Sordish-made groceries played a part in reinging in the country's spiralling inflation, but the key factors to it were the government's investment in Gasom, together with the lifting of the EPA threshold to 49% and the tariff-free Wehzek oil.  ""We stroke a careful balance of foreign investment and autarky in bringing down energy costs."" Rayne said nodding as he ate. ""and we've brought prosperity to Sordland!"" Prosperity certainly describes it. Not only did the economic recession halt, GDP has grown on an average, annualized basis by c. 16% throughout Rayne's 4 years. By the end of his term, unemployment sat at 5% and inflation at 2%.

***""Where I come from, you help out your neighbour in need when times are good for you, because you don't know when you'll need help yourself.""***

Still, the business community's relationship with the Rayne administration is cold at best. The WRA, the prosecution of prominent business owners for corruption and the Luxury Good Tax have strained relations. In fact, all of these programs were undertaken using the war-chest left from Ewald's privatisations coupled with Gasom dividends and several new taxes on alcohol, tobacco and luxury items, the first two after Rayne's veto. ""My problem with such taxes is that they fall on the poorest most heavily. And was is life without some indulgence? But I respect the Assembly's decision."" Rayne wipped the Zabla from his mouth. ""But I fully endorsed the Luxury Goods Tax. Where I come from, you help out your neighbour in need when times are good for you, because you don't know when you'll need help yourself."" Serge then intervened again: ""Yes! Anton helped pay my daughter's tuition, did you know? You write that down!"" The president chuckled again. ""There's no need for that, Serge.""

But the prosperity did not stop at the GDP metric alone. Living standards greatly improved under Rayne, as poverty is at historic lows and child poverty plunging after the passing of the Comprehensive Family Assistance Act, granting means-tested child subsidies to the poorest in Sordland. ""But the metropolitan middle classes also benefited from our policies."" The president pointed out. ""We have fought gentrification greatly and reduced rent pressures in the big cities. Everyone is winning."" Rayne grinned.

Sordish women rights also saw significant advances. By signing a decree granting equal education rights, Rayne oversaw what was seen as a huge step for women in Sordland, long seen as a laggard by the international community. However, to everyone's surprise he then went on to veto the Women's Liberation Act, a bill pushed by the Women's Rights Comission the he himself had formed. ""Those days were hectic... I barely had any input into that bill and Nia and my wife threw my name around alot with the MoAs. Still, I was incredibly impressed by how they managed to get that assembly to pass such a radical bill..."" Rayne gathered his thoughts for a moment. ""The bill had very important measures, but they were asking too much, too quickly."" Did this not cause strife within your marriage? I asked. Rayne sighed yet again. ""The presidency is in some ways the most gratifying thing I've ever done and the most difficult.""

***""Look, I don't agree with Malenyev, but I respect the man. If he doesn't want further Arcasian encroachment in Merkopa I advise him to rein in Hegel, though knowing the man I know that is a tough request.""***

Still, many in the international community condemned Sordland's hardline stance in the Heljiland dispute, standing resolute behind Agnolia and breaking ranks to recognise the small country's sovereignty over the disputed island. ""What we recognise, is that Agnolia holds the island and that will not change withouth bloodshed."" Rayne clarified. ""We stand behind our allies and advise Hegel to see reason."" But Sordland's acceptance of Arcasian aid and military manufacturer investment through the creation of several Arcasian-Sordish joint ventures in Anrica and Arcasian military access to the Erlory air has further increased already boiling tensions. ""And we will grow closer to them still if Valgsland keeps harassing our ship lanes and Agnolian territorial waters."" The president stood resolute. """"Look, I don't agree with Malenyev, but I respect the man. If he doesn't want further Arcasian encroachment in Merkopa I advise him to rein in Hegel, though knowing the man I know that is a tough request.""

Sordland's was also criticised for its approachment to Wehlen and its refusal to admit Bludish refugees after Operation Bear Trap, which international watchdogs classify as ethnic cleansing. ""Let me be clear here: I told Smolak we would not collaborate in the operation, but how could we distinguish honest refugees from terrorist militants?"" He sighed. ""We too face the scourge of Bludish separatism, fuelled by Rumburg interference. We have expanded our relations with Wehlen because we want prosperity and stability for our neighbours, unlike Beatrice..."" Rayne held a tone of contempt as he named the head of state. His government faced another late-term challenge with Rumburg anti-air defences shot down a Sordish airplane in Sordish airspace. The rising tensions led to the revelation of the Rumburgian nuclear weapons program by Rayne at the AN, which was followed by additional sanctions from the international community, adding to the previous OMEC expulsion, and territorial guarantees of Sordland from both Arcasia and United Contana. For now, it seemes like the Rumburgian threat has been held at bay.

But internally, the Bludish separatism threat stands strong and fired up by several events: the passing of the Unified Language Act, which mandated that all education in Sordland be done in Sordish, the refusal from Rayne to address the Izzam Incident or accept Bludish refugees from Wehlen and the joint statement from the PFJP-USP and NFP regarding articles 6 and 7 of the constitution, re-iterating that all Sordish citizens are Sords. ""This is a none issue."" Rayne shook his head. ""No other government in Sordish history has uplifted as many Blud-speaking Sords from poverty. We have made the Supreme Court re-iterate their equitable rights. I do not accept their criticism.""

We were drinking our espressos by now and I wanted to talk with Rayne about his post-election outlook. Rayne also oversaw amendments to the USP party manifesto, expanding the statism doctrine to excplicitly outline state-capitalism as a core party principle and enshrining Dastrunity as a guiding moral compass. This move led to the defection of 13 MPs from the party's reformist wing, most notably of Albin Clavin who was re-elected as an independent while some of these MPs flocked to the PFJP after some wooing from Ricter. His outreach efforts enfuriated Manoly Suheil, who, together with 8 former PFJP MPs, defected to the People's Front.

Lucian Galade, former strategy consultant and close confidant of Rayne, and Karl Greiser former Greater Holsord police chief and the Anti-Corruption Police chief riding a wave of popularity for his work there, were elected to the Assembly for Holsord and Arvory respectively. Rayne has appointed Lucian as the Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister after the resignation of Deivid Wisci while appointing Karl as the Interior Minister following Lileas Graff's failed challenge for the USP leadership.

The USP lost their absolute majority because, while they increased their number of votes to 40%, the People's Front has made history and broke through the 10% threshold to join the GNA. The minority government will require compromise with the other parties and the rift between the USP and its liberal and leftist counterparts has grown. Both demand further democratic constitutional reforms, the termination of the Supreme Council of Sordish Radio and Television which they argue acts as a censor for the state, and de-sollonisation of the education. ""None of that will happen."" Rayne clarified. ""Our constitution is fair and modern. Discipline will remain central in our education, and the Colonel is a remarkable man who can be put as an example to our young. As for the SCSRT, my first two years were marred by instability sown through the media by corrupt, self-serving oligarchs and foreign agents. I will not let that happen again.

* **People's Front - 28 Members**
* **PFJP - 71 Members**
* **USP - 111 Members**
* **NFP - 32 Members**
* **Independents - 8 Members**

The economic recovery coupled with increased tax revenue from the sales tax increases and Gasom dividends has left the new administration with another big war chest, but the minority government requires some collaboration from the opposition to pass through their budget and legislative initiatives. Relations with the NFP remain cordial, so Rayne will likely rely on them to push through his program of army modernisation and navy expansion to deter Rumburg and Valgsland, along with an extension of the H3 highway into Staalport to smooth Sordish agricultural and weapons exports to their ally. ""What my liberal and leftist brothers and sisters don't want to recognise is how close we came to an all-out Rumburgian invasion and Valgsland can try their luck on Heljiland any day now, a strait of high strategic importance to us."" His demeanour had turned somber. ""I managed to leverage the international community to keep these crisis at bay for now, but ultimately we cannot rely on anyone but ourselves."" He downed his coffee. ""We will not debase ourselves nor dance to the tunes of foreign super powers. Be them Beatrice, Melenyev or Dwight. When I am done, we will stand proud on our own.""

While Rayne is known for being energetic, expressive and stubborn, at times it seemed to me like there was tiredness behind the fire in his eyes. On a final note, I asked Rayne what were his plans for after his second term. He seemed caught by surprise. ""I'm not quite sure. I... Need to discuss this further with Monica, but I would like to return to my father's farm in Deyr and take a break from politics. God knows I could use one, but I don't think I can stay away from my country for too long."" There has already been talks among some of the USP MPs of appointing Rayne as a Member of Honour. He would be the first one after the Colonel. Rayne shrugged. ""I would not and am not pushing for it. I'm only aiming to be worthy of it.""

He clicked the computer awake. A browser error blinked: NO INTERNET CONNECTION.

He checked his phone. One bar flashed, then dropped to NO SERVICE.

He picked up the landline, pressed it to his good ear. No dial tone. Just a thin hiss that died when he jiggled the cord.

No calls to Greg or Owen. Just him and twenty-three men in a building the storm was slowly cutting away from the rest of the world.

A group of guests dragged a table from the closet and set chairs around it. Cards slapped down. Laughter rose in short bursts—the familiar shelter noise, stretched thin over something else.

“Yo.”

“Yo, chaplain!”

The voice finally pulled Austin free from the screen.

“Can’t you hear, man?” Gerald sat up, shaking his head with exaggerated disbelief. “It’s cold in here. Can we turn up the heat?”

“Yeah. I got it,” Austin said.

“Man, tryin’ to ignore me,” Gerald muttered.

The thermostat read 67. Set to 72. The numbers glowed faint and sickly.

Austin tapped the faceplate, knowing it wouldn’t help. He dropped the set point to 70, bargaining with plastic: Don’t work so hard. Just hold.

Somewhere in the ducts, metal shuddered. A weak push of warm air sighed from the vent above his head, then faded.

The lights hummed harshly, brightening for one strained moment—as if the entire building had just sucked in one last breath.

Then everything died.

Darkness folded over the mission in a single, heavy sweep. Only a smear of daylight leaked through snow-paste windows, sketching ghost-bunks and hunched shapes.

Austin’s stomach dropped. It hadn’t just been “slipping.” It had finally let go.

“Hey!” someone yelled from the bathroom. “Stop fucking around—turn the light back on!”

Austin closed his eyes and counted a slow inhale. 

Nothing came back.

Eddie drifted into the day room, just a darker outline against the dim windows. His shoulders were nearly up to his ears.

“Man, that didn’t take long,” he said. The laugh tacked on at the end came out brittle. “Might as well’ve taken that tour of the roof, huh?”

Austin could just make out the tear tracks on his cheek. Eddie paced a tight loop, hands flexing, broom abandoned somewhere behind him.

“DUMBASS, TURN THE LIGHTS ON!” The voice from the bathroom came again, louder and sharper, ricocheting off tile and concrete.

“It’ll be okay, Eddie,” Austin said, forcing his voice low and even. “Here—sit.” He dragged a chair closer. The metal legs scraped across the floor, splitting the hush. “We’ll figure it out.”

From the shadows near the far wall, Gerald’s voice slid out, slick.

“Man, he did that on purpose. Tryin’ to freeze us. It’s his game, bro. Same way he did Josh the other night.”

Eddie’s rocking picked up as soon as he hit the chair. “What’s he talkin’ about?” he asked, breath hitching. “You out to kill us? That it?”

The bathroom stall door slammed. The crack of it knifed through the room, straight into Austin’s bad ear. Pain lanced down his jaw. The ringing swelled, drowning half the room.

“GET THE LIGHT ON. NOW.”

The voice had thickened—too deep, too full, like two throats trying to speak through one mouth. Men shifted on their bunks, blankets rustling. Heads turned toward the bathroom without meaning to.

Another slam. Then another. Each one mistimed—just off, like the building’s heartbeat had gone arrhythmic. Austin pictured it, under the stall door, a shadow moved back and forth, pacing in a space too small for pacing.

“Yo, Marcus!” someone called from their bunk. “Go tell him to chill, man.”

Marcus sat up quick, the way he always did—body ready before his brain caught up. “Yeah, yeah,” he said, swinging his feet down. “I got it.”

Austin watched him cross the room in the half-light and disappear into the bathroom.

The shouting cut off. For a second, there was only the muffled storm and Eddie’s ragged breath.

Then the stall door slammed again. Harder. Marcus’s voice shot back, agitated, trying to smooth things over.

“Man, relax. It’s the—”

“Marcus!” the bathroom voice roared. “I know it was you! I saw you hittin’ your pipe by the switch, you fuckin’ crackhead!”

Austin flinched. A couple of the men snickered nervously; others went silent. The accusation crawled down his spine. He’d never seen Marcus smoke in the building—but he couldn’t swear it never happened.

The stall door banged again and again, each impact a hammer blow to his ear. Marcus muttered something low, then backed out fast, shoulders hunched. He kept his eyes on the floor as he crossed the room and dropped onto his bunk, breathing hard.

“Dude is trippin’,” Marcus said, too loudly. “He can wipe his ass in the dark.”

Eddie let out a sound halfway between a laugh and a sob. “I might go take my chances out there,” he whispered, eyes flicking toward the windows.

“No,” Austin said. He crouched so they were closer to eye level, his own face just a faint shape. “Hey. Look at me. We’ll get the power back on. We are not going back out into that storm. Okay?”

Eddie’s gaze slid past him—toward the bathroom, toward the door, anywhere but his eyes.

Another slam shook the wall. Austin’s ear throbbed. The dark pressed closer. Thin daylight smeared by snow made everything look underwater. Somewhere deeper in the building, a pipe pinged as it cooled.

“Man, I’m already freezing,” someone at the card table called. “You better get on that, chaplain.”

“It’s probably just a breaker,” Austin said. His own words sounded distant. “Old building. It does this sometimes.”

“Then go flip it.” Gerald scraped his chair back and stood. “Ain’t that your job?”

The stall banged again, hard enough that dust shook out of the ceiling tiles.

Austin locked his jaw. “Marcus,” he said, turning toward the younger man. His eyes had adjusted enough to catch Marcus’s outline on the bunk. “You remember that panel by the office? The one we flipped last month when the kitchen tripped?”

“Yeah.” Marcus jolted upright again, too fast. “Why?”

“Can you go check it? See if anything’s halfway or down? Just the upstairs panel. If it’s tripped, push it all the way down, then back up. That’s it.”

“Why you sending Marcus?” Gerald asked. “You scared of the dark now?”

A few men snickered. Eddie didn’t. He’d wrapped his arms around himself, rocking slower.

“I need to stay up here,” Austin said. He jerked his chin toward the bathroom. Something in there was still breathing too fast. “We don’t leave the floor without staff.”

He willed it to sound like policy, and not the memory of chairs screaming across tile.

Don’t leave them alone, Greg had written. Austin looked at the dark stairwell and chose the only loophole left: I’m not leaving them. I’m sending.

Marcus tugged his hoodie on. “Yeah, yeah, I got it. You owe me extra coffee.”

He disappeared toward the office. The gray window light didn’t reach that far; he vanished into a thicker dark. His footsteps faded after a few beats.

The stall stayed silent. Only wind pressing at the windows and the rough rasp of Eddie’s breath. The sense of something released, as it had gotten what it wanted: someone alone in the dark.

Austin’s throat tightened with a sick kind of relief: at least it hadn’t been him walking into that bathroom.

“See?” Austin said, mostly for Eddie. “We’ll have lights in a second. It’s just a breaker.”

He counted in his head—five, ten, fifteen seconds. No click. No hum. No shout of “Got it!”

“Yo, where’s Marcus at?” someone called.

“He’s fine,” Austin said quickly. ""It's probably hard to see. Just give him a second.”

His good ear strained toward the office hallway. Nothing. His bad ear rang and rang, a thin, needling whine over everything.

When the lights come back on, he thought, we’ll get extra blankets, move everyone closer, keep the doors shut. Keep them warm. Not another Reggie dragged out of a tunnel. Not another body stiff under a bridge.

“When the lights come back,” he said aloud to Eddie, “we’ll pull more blankets, maybe move everybody nearer the day room. Keep the heat where we can.”

Eddie stared past him, eyes catching a smear of window light. “What if they don’t come back on?” he asked. “What if that’s it?”

“Don’t start that, man,” Gerald cut in. “He just said it’s a breaker.”

“Boiler’s down too, you know that?” another guest said. “You hear it? It’s too quiet.”

Austin realized he hadn’t heard the low, steady thrum under the floor in a while. No heartbeat in the bones of the building. Just cooling metal and the creak of settling.

“Probably just cycled off,” he said. The lie tasted thin.

From the office hallway, a door creaked. A shape moved out of the dark. Marcus stepped back into the gray light of the day room and sat on his bunk without a word.

“Well?” Gerald demanded. “You fix it?”

Marcus didn’t look at him. He lowered himself slowly, shoes still on, hands folding over his chest like he’d forgotten where else they could go.

“Panel’s fine,” he said. His voice was flat. “Nothing tripped.”

“That don’t make no sense,” Gerald snapped. “Lights are out.”

“Panel’s fine,” Marcus repeated. He turned his face toward the wall.

Something cold climbed up Austin’s spine. He saw, uninvited, the bit of hallway between the office and the stairs. The STAFF ONLY door to the basement sitting in the dark. Marcus walking by it. Hearing—

No, he told himself. Stop.

“We’ll, uh… we’ll figure it out,” Austin said. “Might be the main down in the boiler room.”

Eddie’s head snapped toward him. “Boiler room? Downstairs?”

“Yeah,” Austin said before he could catch it.

“Good,” Gerald said. “Then go. Before we all freeze.”

Austin looked toward the hallway. Past the office. To where the light never quite reached even on good days. His stomach knotted. The men’s eyes pressed on him—irritated, scared, counting on him without saying so.

“Later,” he said, too fast. 

DON’T LEAVE THEM ALONE.

The rule flashed like a stop sign behind his eyes.

If he went down now, he didn’t want to know what happen with nobody watching.

If he stayed up here, the cold would keep chewing at them anyway.

He chose the version of wrong he could supervise.

“I’ll go down when everybody’s settled and calm. Last thing we need is people panicking while I’m in the basement.”

“Already panicking, bro,” someone muttered.

Eddie’s rocking picked up again, faster now. Chair legs ticked softly against the floor. “If the boiler’s dead, we’re dead,” he whispered. “They always say in group, you gotta have an exit plan. You can’t just sit in it.”

“This isn’t that group,” Austin said. “There is no exit plan. Out there is worse. We’re safer in here than out there.”

Eddie’s eyes shone wet in the pale light. “I don’t know about that,” he said. “I really don’t.”

Austin didn’t answer.

He stared at the dark mouth of the hallway where the stairwell waited and tried not to picture his palms on the basement floor, cold climbing his arms while twenty-three names upstairs waited to see whether he’d go down for them—or leave them for the morning paper.",1,1770487261.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I awoke to the blaring of an alarm in a different room of the apartment. Feeling the warm blankets wrapped around my body, I shifted, burying my head underneath the pillow, shoving it against the arm of the couch. Grant, usually so punctual, let the alarm ring until the volume was on full blast. Reluctantly, I threw the pillow off my head, sitting up.

“*Grant!*” I yelled. “*Wake the fuck up!*”

I heard loud shuffling, and then a bang, as if he had fallen out of bed. Suddenly, he was at his door, and when his eyes met mine, his jaw dropped.

“*I-I-Ike!*” he stammered like a madman, rushing me while wearing nothing but his boxer briefs. When he came close, I could smell his unwashed body—he hadn’t bathed in days.

Holding my nose, I replied, “What the fuck, man. When’s the last time you showered?”

Grant’s fist balled up, and he slugged me straight in the jaw. My head cocked back from the strike, and the pain radiated through my head. Rubbing absentmindedly at my chin, I turned to stare back at him. He reared up again, and I put my arms out defensively.

“*Wait!* Just wait,” I said, shifting away from him. “Why don’t you tell me why you’re pissed before you hit me again? Remember, I’m an injured man.”

“Injured?” Grant replied, his fist trembling in untapped rage. “Ike, you were gone for over two weeks. Two weeks! Where the fuck have you been? You left your wallet, your phone… all your clothes. *Everything!*”

My breath caught in my throat. “... Did you just say two weeks?”

Grant nodded.

“I’ve been gone for two fucking weeks?”

He nodded again.

Scratching my head, I said, “Fucking shit… What the fuck did you put in that edible? I’ve been having a bad trip for two whole weeks? How am I even alive?”

“What?” he replied. “What edible? What the hell are you even talking about?”

I pointed to the kitchen. “The one in the goddamn fridge—it was the only one there.”

“*Oh…*” Grant replied, putting his hand to his chin. “A friend gave it to me. Said it would calm my nerves—with all the tests coming up. It didn’t have anything… well, except for some weed, I assume.”

“That wasn’t no fucking weed. I had the weirdest fucking dreams—like old-school fantasy shit. Werewolves—no, wererats…. stuff like that. Two weeks… Where the fuck was I? Skid Row?”

“Not likely,” Grant replied. “That’s where I checked first. And the cops, they laughed at me when I tried to report you missing. Shit’s fucked, man.”

“*Fuck me…*” I suddenly realized something and surged to my feet. “Wait… what about my job?”

Grant finally relaxed, moving to the coffee table and grabbing a simple white envelope. He handed it to me. “Final paycheck. Got sent in the mail. I tried to tell your manager, the fat one—” He snapped his fingers. “Gary. Yeah, Gary—but he said it was job abandonment. Nothing he could do.”

I slouched back down to the couch, running my hand through my hair. “Fuck… I lost my damn job. Fucking Gary. He always had it out for me.”

Grant merely shrugged his shoulders. He sat down next to me. “That’s not all. I was so worried about you that I may have also called off a few days. Maybe a few too many. Like you, I also lost my job.”

I turned to my friend. “Oh, man… I’m sorry.”

Grant waved it off. “Doesn’t matter—it's a temp job, anyway. You know me, pushing for that doctorate. Work was just getting in the way. But…”

“*But…*” I replied, sensing a shift in the conversation and tone.

“Well, I won’t be able to cover your portion of the rent anymore. Luckily, I still receive an allowance from my parents, but I’ll need someone else to pick up the slack. Ike, I love ya’ man, but unless you can find a new job quickly, one that pays some real money, I think I’ll need to evict ya’.”

Grant’s words struck me hard. Very hard. I hadn’t realized until then how much I relied on his friendship. Besides a place to stay, he kept me grounded to the earth. Without that, I may as well be another nameless face on the streets of L.A.

Remembering my time in the dream, I was suddenly filled with renewed vigor. If I could kill a damn werewolf… *er, wererat,* then I could find a damn job.

I stood, looking back towards my friend. “I got it. Don’t worry, I’ll figure everything out. And don’t go placing the ad on the internet just yet.”

Grant smiled. “I hope you do. I got it this month, but next, I’ll need double your usual amount.”

It stung, but I nodded towards him.

He rose from the couch and walked towards his room, but stopped short of the entrance, his hand resting on the handle. “And don’t go disappearing on me again. If you do, the couch won’t be here when you come back.”

“You got it.”

Grant closed the door, and I laid back down on the couch again. I was suddenly exhausted, as if I’d run a few miles. Or fought a bloodthirsty wererat. Two weeks… I was gone for two whole weeks.

My arm slung off the side of the coach as I was lost in thought, and, as it dangled, I felt something peculiar. I grasped the unknown item and brought it to my eyes… It was a knife. Made crudely, as if it were made hundreds of years ago—

And it was covered in blood.

\*\*\*

I walked down a dark alleyway alone—not one to learn my lessons. Water dripped off slick, red-bricked walls, and it smelled of musk and piss. If I listened closely, I could still hear the sounds of devious footsteps walking behind me, fraying my nerves.

Luckily, unlike the last alley I’d been in, nothing happened to me as I reached my destination. A signless door with large metal bars greeted me. I pushed it open, and the weight of it pushed back on me. The door was heavy, and my muscles strained against the hinges. In the end, I managed; a true warrior I was.

Inside, the shop was filled with an assortment of timeworn trinkets. Light filtered in through a break in the overhead rafters, revealing dust floating in the air like falling leaves in winter. The place was filthy, and I wondered silently if it had ever been cleaned before. Each step served to punctuate my thought, kicking even more dirt up into the air, which drifted down to rest on some old maps. Reaching down, I wipe them off.

There was a rap on glass not too far away, and a masculine voice followed after it. “Can I help you?”

I turned around a bookshelf to view an empty glass counter. Walking towards it, I saw expensive-looking items inside. Jewelry, watches, and knives… anything and everything imaginable. I leaned my arms across the glass to get a better look.

“Get your arms off the glass,” the unseen voice said. “Were you born in a barn?”

“Sorry,” I replied, taking a step back.

I heard continued shuffling, and I leaned over the counter, making sure not to touch it, to see a bear of a man shifting through some old-looking stuff on the ground. He peered up at me, and I immediately retracted my previous assessment. She wore thick powdered makeup, red lipstick, and black eyeliner. Standing, she towered over me, despite my own moderate height.

The woman flexed reflexively, showing deep veins in her biceps, and I knew she could crush my skull if she so inclined. It was in stark contrast with the shiny red dress she wore. The pawn owner reminded me of Little Red Riding Hood—if Little Red Riding Hood was 6’6 with a full beard who benched three-hundred plus at least.

I coughed into my hand. “*Hmph*. Yes, well… I was seeing if I could pawn something here. I need the cash… *ma’am*?”

The pawnshop owner nodded in approval, her discerning eyes becoming more accepting of me. “Well, this is a pawnshop. Pawning stuff is typically what we do. Well, that and running off crackheads.” She crossed her arms across her chest. “You’re not a crackhead, are you?”

I shook my head. “No, ma’am.” More softly, I said, “Well… I can’t remember the last two weeks, *so…*”

She narrowed her eyes and then asked, “And what do you have?”

I carefully reached into my pocket, pulling out a knife, which was wrapped in a plastic bag. I set it down on the counter; the glass clinked as it touched. At the glare she leveled at me, I shied away. Nimbly, her hands shot out, ripping the dagger from its plastic sheath, and throwing the bag to the ground. I reached out to warn her, but it was too late as her hands ran the length of the blade and through the dried blood.

Looking at her own hands, she sneered. “Did you kill someone with this?”

“*What? No!*” I replied, perhaps too hastily as her eyes narrowed once again. I had practiced my lie so many times before coming here. Even made a backstory about having a hunter in the family, but I could tell that she’d dealt with that type before. My type—the lying kind. In a moment of clarity, I decided to be truthful… sorta’. “It’s not human blood.”

“*Hmm,*” she replied, still holding the blade, which she turned around in her hand. She placed it back down, avoiding the glass, setting it instead on a wooden partition. “No sale. I don’t want any part of what trouble you’re bringing. Sorry, I just get feelings about people.”

I opened my mouth to protest, but that stare she gave—it was a stare that she’d likely given many a drug addict trying to pawn loose, stolen items. It spoke to her unwillingness to take any shit. I saved my breath, reaching out and grabbing the knife.

Something seemed to catch the pawn owner’s eye as she suddenly put her hand down on mine, holding me still. “Wait,” she said, moving my hand and picking the knife back up. “How old did you say this was again?”

“Ancient,” I replied. “I don’t know exactly how old, but old.”

Again, she turned the knife around in her hand. “And how much do you want for it?”

“Three-hundred.”

She bellowed out a laugh. “Not a chance. Fifty bucks.”

I knew the three-hundred was a long shot, but, sadly; I was hoping to get more.

“One-hundred,” I countered. “And it comes with the promise that if I can get more old stuff like this, I’ll send it your way.”

The pawnshop owner looked me up and down. “And do I need to worry about how you obtain said items?”

“No,” I replied simply.

Taking my answer at face value, she reached out a hand. “Deal.”

I shook, but she pulled me close, and as I tried to resist, she let me know how much stronger she was than I.

“If you’re lying,” she warned, “then you better hope the cops deal with you first. It would be better than me.” She let go, and I reflexively pulled back. “What’s your name, anyway?”

“What’s yours?” I replied, rubbing my sore hand. It was a stupid retort, but it was all I could manage at the time.

“Ruby.”

“Of course it is.”

She put her hands on her hips. “And what’s that mean?”

I took a step back. “Nothing… nothing—it’s just because of your pretty red dress. My name is Isaac, but my friends call me Ike.”

“Alright, Isaac,” she replied with a coy smile. “Sign here.” Placing a paper down in front of me, she handed me a pen.

I signed the dotted lines, writing my initials where asked, and she placed an ink pad on the counter, adding, “Thumbs.”

Sighing, I placed my thumbs into the ink and pressed them to the paper. “There.”

Ruby lifted the paper to her lips and blew, setting it back down on the counter. She opened her till, pulling out a crisp one-hundred-dollar bill, which she pulled between her two hands. She set it on the counter, and I hurriedly snatched and pocketed it.

Smiling, she said, “Good doing business. Hope to see you again soon.”

I turned and left as quickly as possible, closing the door gently as I did. Walking away, I couldn’t help but wear a smile on my face.

My stupid, gullible face.

I heard a sound echoing in the alley as a familiar voice said, “Empty your wallet.”

“Aww shit, it’s you again?” another voice added to the first. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw my two ‘friends’—the very same who’d mugged me before—emerge from the dark.

1qykmju,https://www.reddit.com/r/UAE/comments/1qykmju/uae_10_year_golden_visa_for_top_graduates_of/,UAE 10 Year Golden Visa for Top graduates of international universities Process,"Hello everyone, I managed to get my 10 year UAE Golden Visa through the route for top graduates of international universities last week, and I wanted to write this up because when I was going through it, I couldn’t find anything that had all the information in one place. Hopefully my experience helps someone else avoid the confusion and wasted time I had at the start. 

For background, I graduated in July 2024 from a university in the UK on the list (see the list [here](https://adro.gov.ae/-/media/Project/Expat-Bureau/International-Universities.pdf)). It’s important to note that I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree, not a Master’s. Some places say Master’s are accepted too, but from what I saw, only Bachelor’s degrees get approved, and Master’s degrees unfortunately get rejected for this route, so do not rely on a Master’s degree for this category. [This page](https://adro.gov.ae/Visas/Types-of-Visas/Abu-Dhabi-Golden-Visa/Students) says bachelor's only and [this person's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/1fkjszt/update_golden_visa_for_masters_students_from/) seems to confirm it. 

The other big thing is GPA. They do not accept UK degree classifications like First Class, 2:1, etc. They want a GPA. In my case, my university issued a separate document literally called a GPA Certificate with my GPA and the scale, alongside my degree and transcript, which I think definitely helped. Either way, you will need something official that clearly states your GPA (ideally with the scale), because without that, you’ll probably get stuck.

This whole process is basically three separate applications:

1. **Nomination Request**
2. **Golden Visa Application**
3. **Emirates ID Application**

I’ll go through exactly what I did from start to finish, including the parts that caused issues. Also, I should mention I had never lived in the UAE before and had only been once as a tourist in 2016 so I had no current visa or residence or anything.

# Step 0 (Do this before traveling): Prerequisites you should prepare outside the UAE

# 1) DataFlow / QuadraBay verification → MoHESR Equivalency

Before even coming to the UAE, you should get the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHESR) equivalency, and this is done through DataFlow or QuadraBay (they’re the third party verification companies the MOE uses).

I started from the MoHESR website (see [here](https://www.mohesr.gov.ae/En/EServices/ServiceCard/pages/universiycertificateequilization.aspx)) and it redirected me to DataFlow. At this stage you’ll need to make a UAE Pass account.

DataFlow asks you to sign a consent form so they can contact your university to confirm your graduation and study details. This can take time because they’re basically waiting on the university.

In my case, my university didn’t respond to DataFlow, so DataFlow asked me to email my university directly and obtain a letter with specific details. They told me exactly what they wanted the letter to include, and I asked my university registry for a letter confirming:

* my enrollment dates
* that the program was on campus (not transfer)
* the examination location / study location

They also wanted the letter to have a signature and stamp from the university.

Once I sent this letter to DataFlow, they completed the verification and issued a DataFlow report confirming the degree. After that, I went back to the MoHESR website, continued the application using the DataFlow report number, and I  received my MoHESR equivalency after 2 days.

I did this at the end of 2024. It didn’t seem to expire, so it’s something you can do well in advance. Keep in mind this is quite time consuming, I applied on 28th August, and got my MoHESR equivalency on 30th October.

Price: 645 AED to the company and 100 AED to MoHESR.

# 2) Legalize your degree documents (highly recommended)

Next, I legalized my:

* degree
* transcript
* GPA certificate

I wanted to make sure I didn’t end up in a situation where something gets rejected because of missing attestation, so I did the full embassy attestation. 

For the UK, the steps were:

* **Solicitor certification** (similar to notary in other countries): the solicitor certifies the document is original or a true copy. I used the originals, since I can always order replacements from my university and didn’t want to deal with copies. You can find a solicitor in your area that does this.
* **Apostille** from the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO): this legalizes the solicitor’s stamp.
* **UAE embassy attestation** in the country where the document was issued (for me, UAE embassy in London). In the UK this is done through external companies, not by walking into the embassy (see [here](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/missions/london/services/attestation-information)).
* This is typically bundled with **UAE MOFA attestation** as part of the same service, and you also get a digital attestation you can verify online.

In the UK there are companies that handle this end to end. I used one because I was travelling at the time. It probably cost me around £100–£150 more than doing it myself, but it saved a lot of time and hassle because I just sent the documents and they handled everything and mailed them back, without me having to do or handle anything.

For other countries, the process is fairly similar in that first you’ll need your local MOFA's stamp (which will likely be an apostille in most countries) followed by attestation through the UAE Embassy of that country and UAE MOFA.

At this stage, you’ve done everything that can be done outside the UAE.

Price: £580 (however you can save £100-150 by doing the steps yourself, also more documents cost more, this was for 3 documents: degree, transcript, and GPA certificate)

# Before the 3 applications - things you should understand (this part is confusing but important):

# Two immigration systems: ICP vs GDRFA

The UAE has two immigration systems:

* **ICP** is the federal system and handles Abu Dhabi and all the other Emirates (Sharjah, Ajman, RAK, Fujairah, Umm Al Quwain).
* **GDRFA** handles immigration for Dubai.

Some things are still routed through ICP even if you’re dealing with Dubai, which adds to the confusion. The main thing to keep in mind is that Dubai has its own system, and for certain processes (including Golden Visa issuance), where your file is matters.

# What “your file” means (and why it matters)

When you enter the UAE or apply for a visa, your immigration “file” ends up tied to a specific Emirate:

* If you applied for a visa before arriving, your file is tied to the Emirate that issued the visa.
* If you’re visa-on-arrival, your file is tied to the Emirate you enter through.

Why this matters: if you want to apply for the Dubai Golden Visa route, your file needs to be in Dubai. One of the ""Additional Information"" points [here](https://www.gdrfad.gov.ae/en/services/8ea80dad-f43e-11eb-0320-0050569629e8) mentions it.

I ran into this because I originally applied for a entry visa through the ICP website, which resulted in a visa issued by Abu Dhabi. This didn’t stop me entering through Dubai, but it meant my file was in Abu Dhabi. The Amer center I went to told me that if I wanted to apply via Dubai, my file needed to be in Dubai, so I would need to exit and re-enter on a Dubai-issued entry.

For me, this was manageable because I’m a GCC resident and could do the exit/re-entry and apply for the appropriate entry easily. If you’re a visa-on-arrival nationality, this is generally easier: just make sure you enter through Dubai if you want your file to be in Dubai.

# Amer centers / typing centers

You’ll also hear the terms Amer center and typing center. These are basically authorized contractors that submit and manage applications within the GDRFA system. You generally won’t be going directly to GDRFA, you’ll be dealing with Amer centers for a lot of steps.

One very practical thing: have scanned copies of everything beforehand. Every Amer center I went to asked for digital copies of everything. I didn’t need anything printed out, and it makes things super quick because you can just send everything to them over WhatsApp (that’s basically how nearly all of them operate).

# How to check your file + your UID (very important)

You can check your details online by entering your passport information here:

[https://smartservices.icp.gov.ae/echannels/web/client/default.html#/fileValidity](https://smartservices.icp.gov.ae/echannels/web/client/default.html#/fileValidity)

When you do this, choose ""Passport Information"" and choose visa and you’ll see:

* your file number, which indicates which Emirate your file is in
* your Emirates Unified Number (UID)

The UID is the one number linked to you no matter when you visit, and it does not change. I first visited the UAE about 10 years ago, and my UID stayed the same.

This UID is important because it’s basically what’s used as your identifier until you get your Emirates ID. Once you have your Emirates ID, that becomes the main number you use, but the UID is still an important number to have on hand and it shows up again in later stages of the nomination as well. If you apply for a visa from before, this will usually be on the visa too. If you entered on visa-on-arrival, you can still retrieve it from the passport inquiry page.

A rough indicator for file location is:

* file numbers starting with 2 or 20 indicate Dubai
* file numbers starting with 1 or 10 indicate Abu Dhabi 

(Other Emirates fall under ICP since Dubai is the one with the separate system.)  


# Dubai vs Abu Dhabi (what I experienced)

It doesn’t matter whether your Golden Visa is issued by Dubai or Abu Dhabi in terms of where you can live. You can live anywhere in the UAE.

However, at the time I applied, it seemed like Abu Dhabi Golden Visas were not being processed. I saw a lot of Reddit threads mentioning this, and I also contacted ICP directly and was told Golden Visas were not being issued at the moment. Speaking to an immigration supervisor I was told apparently Abu Dhabi allows the process to be started from outside the UAE as the nomination can be through TAMM, however the page [here](https://www.tamm.abudhabi/en/life-events/individual/Identity-Citizenship-Human-Resources/Residency-Entry-Permit/RequestforGoldenVisaNomination) says ""Applicant presence in UAE while applying."" Based on this and the ICP website, it seems you have to be in the UAE before applying for a nomination. I’ve seen some comments for companies saying they can do nominations outside but I’m not sure if I'd trust them. 

Anyways, Abu Dhabi golden visas on hold effectively meant Dubai was my only option, and this guide is based on Dubai.

Now onto the actual applications:

# Application 1 of 3: Nomination Request (the most important part)

Once you’re in the UAE and your file is in Dubai, the first step is the nomination request. This is where you submit your academic documents and they decide whether you are eligible. This is the most important stage because once nomination is approved, the rest is mostly procedural.

You submit this through the ICP website regardless of Emirate, but during the nomination you select the Emirate (for me, Dubai). It costs around AED 150. Here is the link: [https://smartservices.icp.gov.ae/echannels/web/client/guest/index.html#/goldenServicesDashboard](https://smartservices.icp.gov.ae/echannels/web/client/guest/index.html#/goldenServicesDashboard)

You’ll need to go to ""Golden Residency Services"" then ""Inside UAE"" then ""Nomination Request""

You can do this yourself online. I did it through an Amer center and they charged me AED 100 to submit it for me. In hindsight, if you’re comfortable filling in forms and uploading documents, this is one step you can probably do yourself and save the extra AED 100.

# What I submitted

* passport copy
* entry visa copy (if you entered with a pre-issued visa; not relevant for visa-on-arrival)
* degree
* transcript
* GPA certificate
* MoHESR equivalency

# Timeline and the issue I hit

I arrived on Monday and submitted the nomination around 4 PM at an Amer center. By around 4:15 PM, it was returned for modification, and they said they needed a letter from my university giving my GPA on a 4.0 scale.

My GPA certificate was on a 4.25 scale, and 4.25 was the maximum (which I achieved). The nomination form doesn’t let you enter 4.25 out of 4, so I entered 4/4. If I entered it out of 5, then I’d be below the 3.5/4 threshold when converted as a percentage, so that didn’t make sense either.

At this point, I was stressed because I didn’t know how quickly the university would respond with a letter. At the same time, I noticed that the GPA certificate had the scale on the second page, and I suspected they may not have looked at it closely.

So what I did was: I took a post-it note and wrote in Arabic that my GPA was 4.25 out of 4 due to outstanding achievement and that they should look at the scale. I made that page the first page of the uploaded document so it was impossible to miss.

I also requested a letter from my university in parallel, which I didn’t end up needing. Either way, after resubmitting on Monday evening, the nomination was approved by Thursday 1 PM (so about three days later).

Once nomination is approved, you’re most of the way there.

# Amer Center note:

You do not need to keep going to the same Amer center for each step. I used the Amer Center in the Dubai Airport Free Zone for nomination because it was recommended online and seemed experienced, but you can do the next steps at any Amer center closest to you with good reviews (and save time and taxi fares).

For reference, these are the Amer centers I used:

* Nomination + Golden Visa application: [**https://maps.app.goo.gl/1C7cwqaXdWiF87HRA**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1C7cwqaXdWiF87HRA)
* Emirates ID application: [**https://maps.app.goo.gl/HYnpLHmJEC1qz9ve7**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HYnpLHmJEC1qz9ve7) 

Also, it seems Amer centers charge a 2.5% fee if you pay by card so I'd recommend paying by cash, there will most likely be an ATM nearby you can go to.

Price for nomination: 260 AED (150 for the nomination + 100 AED for the Amer center doing it for me)

# Application 2 of 3: Golden Visa Application

After nomination is approved, the next step is to apply for the actual Golden Visa. You might be able to do it yourself (I’m not sure), but I’d recommend using an Amer center for this because the cost is already around AED 2,700–2,800 and the Amer fee becomes negligible relative to the total.

For this stage, they asked me for:

* passport
* entry visa
* copy of my degree
* nomination number / nomination approval (and proof it was accepted)

They submitted the application for me and I paid AED 2,840 total (including Amer fees of about 40 AED). I submitted this on Thursday at 6pm, and they told me it would take around 3–4 days.

However, the next day (Friday) at 10 AM, I received an email saying my Golden Visa had been pre-approved and I needed to do the medical test.

# Medical test (and why I used Smart Salem)

You have to do a UAE residency medical test. The Amer center recommended Al Nahda medical center ([here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mrVMUWxjPDJWscgw9)), where it was:

* \~AED 320 for results in 24 hours
* \~AED 700-ish for results in 6 hours

I wanted to finish as quickly as possible, so I went to [Smart Salem](https://smartsalem.ae/products/visa-medical-test), which does it in about 30 minutes. The total was AED 750 (it’s listed as 700 but they add 50 for “typing,” basically the application work).

If speed matters, I’d recommend Smart Salem. If you’re not in a rush, the standard medical centers are fine and much cheaper.

My experience was very straightforward. I arrived with my passport, they verified details, I confirmed my name was correct, then:

* quick blood draw
* chest X-ray

The whole thing took around 10 minutes. I did it on Friday around 2:30 PM at Index Mall/DIFC area and walked around for coffee, and almost exactly 30 minutes later I received the medical certificate by email saying I was fit.

About an hour after that, I received another email from GDRFA confirming my Golden Visa was approved, with my e-residence visa attached. This is the digital version of the residency that used to be placed in your passport (which is not done anymore).

At that stage, you’re done with the second application and you officially have 10-year residency. From what immigration officials told me, if you’re not planning to live in the UAE and you just want the residency, you can leave the UAE at this point and come and go as a resident. 

# Application 3 of 3: Emirates ID Application

Even though you now have residency, if you want to actually live in the UAE properly (bank account, SIM card on Emirates ID, local services, etc.) you need to get your Emirates ID. This is the final application.

I went to an Amer center and applied for the Emirates ID. I paid AED 1,192 total (including fees) for the 10-year Emirates ID card. Again, the Amer fees are something like 30 AED so not really an issue.

During this application, you need to provide a delivery address. I used my hotel address, and they told me they typically contact you beforehand to confirm where you want it delivered.

After the application is submitted, your status will show something like ""Waiting for fingerprint"", because the next step is biometrics.

# Biometrics (Customer Happiness Centers) — and the timing trap

Biometrics need to be done at a Customer Happiness Center. This is confirmed online and by immigration staff.

Customer Happiness Centers list: [**https://icp.gov.ae/en/customer-happiness-centers/**](https://icp.gov.ae/en/customer-happiness-centers/)

At the center, the ones mentioned to me were Al Nahda and Al Ghazal, so I’d recommend going to one of these to avoid being redirected:

* [Al Ghazal Mall biometrics / Customer Happiness Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ukty7vQLqVTucutLA)
* [Al Nahda biometrics center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6sEoikWj6YU9LN7q9)

The Amer center initially told me to go to Jafiliya Immigration. I went there and they told me they only deal with visas, and I needed to go to Al Ghazal Mall for biometrics.

I went to Al Ghazal Mall, but it was 5 PM on a Friday. Even though the center was open until later, they told me that Golden Visa biometrics are handled at only one counter, and that counter is only open **7 AM to 3 PM**, and they recommended coming early. So I couldn’t do biometrics that day and had to wait until Monday.

As I write this, it's Saturday so I'll update this when I go through the rest of the process.

# Timeline:

**Day 1 (Monday):** Arrived in Dubai. Submitted nomination around 4 PM. Returned for modification around 4:15 PM requesting GPA on 4.0 scale. Resubmitted same day with clarification + asked university for letter.  
**Day 2 (Tuesday):** Waiting (no action needed from me).  
**Day 3 (Wednesday):** Waiting (no action needed from me).  
**Day 4 (Thursday \~1 PM):** Nomination approved. Submitted Golden Visa application the same day at 6pm.  
**Day 5 (Friday \~10 AM):** Golden Visa pre-approved. Did medical at Smart Salem around 2:30 PM. Medical result received \~30 minutes later. Golden Visa approved about an hour after that and e-residence visa issued. Submitted Emirates ID application later. Attempted biometrics at 5 PM, told Golden Visa biometrics counter is 7 AM–3 PM only.  
**Day 6–7 (Weekend):** No biometrics possible for me due to timing.  
**Day 8 (Monday 7 AM):** Will go do biometrics and update.

# Overall thoughts / what I would do differently:

All in all, the process took around a week for me. There weren’t many processing delays as such, the biggest time-waster was honestly just waiting in all the traffic and at the Amer centers, because sometimes they only have one counter doing these applications and you can be sitting there for ages.

If I did it again, I would do the nomination myself online if you’re comfortable uploading documents (because when mine got returned for modification, I just re-uploaded it myself anyway, and paying AED 100 for the Amer center felt unnecessary in hindsight).

Also, the ICP chat (https://icp.gov.ae/en/contact-us/) and GDRFA chat (https://www.gdrfad.gov.ae/en/contact-information) are actually quite helpful with basic queries.

Hopefully this guide helps. Everything I’ve written here is based on what I personally did, and things I clarified directly with immigration staff while going through it. I’m happy to answer any questions about the process if anyone is going through the same route. Also I didn’t include pictures of the various applications and documents but feel free to DM me for these.",1,1770487232.0,UAE,0,1.0,False
1qykmce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qykmce/19f_yearned_for_my_girl_bsf_for_a_year_xxed_on/,"(19f) yearned for my girl bsf for a year, xxed on newyears then moved away 10 hours and haven’t spoken since","**I’m staying over to visit her friend next week, (aka her apartment building) and I just need to get this off my chest and get some advice/similar experiences before I see her again.**

Me and my bestfriend Sam (M19) moved in together in a tiny apartment building for our senior year of hs. One floor below us lived Alex (f18) that was on the grade below us. We 3 hit it off instantly and became an inseparable trio.

Our routine for that entire year:

\- wake up & eat breakfast in our apartment 

\- go to school together 

\- go back home in recess to smoke cigs,  drink coffee, read and listen to vinyls

\- finish the schoolday, make dinner together 

\- drive to the woods and smoke weed

\- have deep conversations 

\- bake something eat a bunch of shit and watch movies til we fell asleep at \~4am 

\- repeat

I don’t think I’ve ever had that deep of a friendship, I’m amazed we made everything work so well as a trio, it just kinda did.

But I was deeply in love with Alex, so much so i thought I had some sick and twisted infatuation/limerence about her. I was genuinely tweaking at night about it. And i didnt tell a soul. She was so weird, talked like a farmer and dressed like a boy from the 2000s, loved action movies &  Rue Pauls drag race, even rode a motorcycle. I loved everything about her style, face, hair and demeanour. Sometimes I couldn’t focus on what she was saying to me and had to go to my room to breathe. I pushed my feelings so sooo far down.

We 3 lived so closely together it made me feel like a prevented creep. I’d dream about kissing her and she’d wake me up to get me ready for school.

We were strictly friends, she’d even be painfully rude and sarcastic towards me. But she was never mean, she was the most selfless person I know. But when we would get high we would end up cuddling for hours, I’d scratch her back and massage her whenever I could. We’d share her twin sized bed and she’d lay in my arms. I don’t think she ever led me on, there was just a different energy between us when we were alone together. I could name countless romantic moments I had with her that was just never mentioned or discussed ever. Especially when we were drunk, I always planned to kiss her at a party but it never worked out.

And then me and Sam graduated and moved out, and other friends we had in the grade below us moved in, and I had to force myself to get over it. We both moved out 10 hours away in different directions. We all cried a lot and gave each other handmade goodbye gifts and planned roadtrips and calls to stay in contact. 

But that didn’t happen, Alex completely cut contact. She never called or texted, and we were so worried about her because we were practically her only friends at that time. We spoke to her other friends about it and turns out she was completely fine just “busy”

Then, 6 months later

I host my annual new years party

I invite 7 of my friends form hs including her. AWKWARD silence between me/sam/her

We have a serious conversation outside and she basically tells us she doesn’t want to keep contact because we need to grow in different directions on our own. (Fair but, I at least expect us to be able to talk when we’re together?) So I just end up not  paying attention to her at all during the party and distract myself with hosting.

Amazing party, played games and drank of couse. Everyone in town was outside with the fireworks including us. 

Alex and I end up sharing an entire bottle of vodka, and me tells me about this DISGUSTING GIRL named Emily. (Horrible person for multiple reasons) And how she’d definitely “do her” if she was drunk with her.

And i get so angry

I get so incredibly angry that I drunkenly yelled out my entire confession and all the feelings I had for her. She got so shocked she dropped my vodka bottle and shattered it on the street.

And she of course tells me she liked me back, but told herself I was off limits because of our friendship. We ended up running away from the entire party and talking for hours. About our lives and everything that had been going on for the last 5 months. And then we made out, for about 3 hours. In the snow and up against fences and behind buss stops. And when we got home at 5:30am we pretended like nothing had happened to our friends that were awake. Then we made out and ykyk in my bed alone, after all that we were sobering up and honestly it was getting too serious, so we smoked but that just made us pass out out of exhaustion and going to bed.

Next morning was horrible, so embarrassed it was horrific. I couldn’t look her in the eyes while all of us ate breakfast and I was of course asked what we did all night. We later talked and agreed that it was very stupid and unnecessary, that we had “dug up something we didn’t have to” and I agreed with that, at the time. Then she shook my hand and said “no homo”

But now I’m a mess and I have been in a mess ever since it happened, I’ve been going through a complete identity crisis and I think about her so so much. She hasn’t even sent a text. 

I just feel so emotionally unavailable because of it and I’m almost unable to move on and enjoy my new school and friends. 

And like I said im visiting her friend that moved into my old apartment, and I will probably see her. I just want advice on how to keep my self respect/ boundaries/ or idk actually talk to her about it?? 

Im so so sorry for this being so stupid long, hopefully someone out there gets me ",1,1770487222.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

We have meetings with 3-5 people to tackle the big questions, we use threads (open to the whole team) on Discord to discuss smaller topics/pitch ideas/touch on stuff that's not currently being worked on. 

The meetings generally work best if someone prepares them, laying the ground works of the different design directions that are being considered with their implications (pros, cons, effects on player experience and other design choices). To keep the meetings on point we try to not digress. Unfortunately this also means some aspects of design remain untouched, sometimes for too long.

The threads work for smaller topics or to slightly modify/finetune things that are already in the works. They stop being efficient once they go to a more high level topic because then several team members are half working/half chatting simultaneously. Chat can also be a more competitive and less thoughtful form of discussion than a well structured meeting.

Here are some challenges/things that are missing on which I'd like to hear your advice:

- Keeping everyone up to date about the major design decisions, without inviting too many people in meetings or flooding everyone with information they don't need. Usually people discover things on the weekly playtest, which is often good because then we get a fresh reaction to what we're working on. But sometimes that doesn't happen or sometimes I think it'd be beneficial for the team to know more about the design intent and future plans. One thing that helps here is to provide a bit more information before the playtest. But I'm wondering if you would advise to have some weekly briefing notes for the whole team or something like that.

- Involving the broader team. What is a good way to keep the team informed and provide an opportunity for them to share their thoughts, while simultaneously not questioning everything or going too far outside of the current design space/vision of the game. Without inviting everyone to every meeting.

- Tackling lower priority design topics or secondary aspects of a big design topic. Sometimes I feel like the big questions get answered, we start prototyping and then it kind of just stops and we move on to the next thing. Or we never discuss secondary aspects or have a deeper look at something, because other matters feel more pressing. We can't add meetings for these, but threads aren't sufficient. We can share thoughts and ideas somewhere on Miro or a document, but then it gets spread out over time. I was thinking of introducing a (bi)weekly design discussion which people can join if they want to, to discuss these topics. Like a 20 min coffee break talk, or a have a chat over lunch about a topic. Just to hear people earlier in the process and maybe also cover some of the information sharing gap between the subteams. I think it would be nice to have casual conversations but with a bit more intent and guard rails to delineate the spectrum in which to brainstorm.

I'm interested to hear any advice on how to approach this and design practices you've found helpful.",2,1770486866.0,gamedesign,2,1.0,False

1qykemc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qykemc,Two Weeks In: Raw Thoughts on a Full Reps Bundle,"Picked up this mix last month—wore everything through commutes, errands, and lazy weekends. Zero staging, zero fluff. Just honest notes.

KZ AJ4
Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks
Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie
Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie
Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie
Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants
Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants
Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

I'm 12 weeks tomorrow, and last night I got my first. It was AWFUL. I was approved to take my sumatriptan, so I took it with 2 tylenol (I usually take it with aleve, but alas, pregnancy) and I either took it too late to help, or being pregnant changed my reaction to it. I got so nauseous, got sick multiple times. Sleep helped a bit and my husband ordered me a coffee mid morning to see if the caffeine would help. IT DID! For two hours... and now migraine is back with a vengeance. I took meds again, and I'm nauseous again, so now I think either the meds aren't working so I'm reaching the nausea stage of the migraine, or the meds themselves are making me nauseous. 

  
Anyone have any headache/migraine hacks/tricks during their pregnancies? I'm trying to get food in me soon, trying to get water down without getting sick.

1qykck8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/1qykck8/my_story/,my story,"This is the story of how a wrongly prescribed medication can so easily destroy your life. On a friend’s recommendation, I went to a psychiatrist. I didn’t have that many problems, but because I lost my dad when I was 12, I was extremely sensitive about the people I loved, and I would overreact to even the smallest thing, going into extreme panic. If they didn’t pick up the phone even once, I would instantly assume something bad had happened to them. And on top of that, I was in a turbulent and exhausting relationship with someone I was truly in love with for the first time. I had an abnormal fear of losing him and it felt like I would die without him, so I wanted to get a bit of therapy; maybe they could prescribe one of the mildest antidepressants so I could be a bit more mentally stable. I had never used antidepressants before. But on both my mother’s and father’s side there is a heavy addiction gene. I lost my father to cocaine. My grandmother is an alcoholic. My mother may not be at the level where you’d outright call her an alcoholic, but she has a weakness for alcohol, has even received treatment for it, and once she starts, she can’t stop. My aunt and uncle are straight-up alcoholics. My doctor knew about everyone’s situation in my family. And I was a girl who had never used any drugs in her life, had never even taken an antidepressant, and only drank alcohol socially with friends, in normal amounts. At my very first appointment, he prescribed me three different antidepressants, Ativan, and Ritalin. At 23, he diagnosed me with ADHD. I didn’t know what Ritalin was. To be honest, I didn’t know anything about meds at all. Let alone their active ingredients, their effects, what they were for I didn’t even know the names of eighty percent of them. I went to the pharmacy, got the meds, and had no idea which one was which color prescription. I just handed over the prescription and took what they gave me. Then, the next morning, I took one Ritalin when I woke up, just as my doctor had prescribed.

Later in my life, I would try almost every drug, but I will never forget what I felt the first time I took Ritalin. That first time, I finished a 1,000-piece puzzle in a single day. I was insanely joyful, I was getting an unbelievable amount of pleasure out of everything, my communication with people became incredibly fun, and most importantly, as someone with bulimia and an eating disorder, I was absolutely, absolutely never hungry. Everything was incredible.

Anyway, long story short, after a while the duration of effect of one pill started to shorten, and my mood started dropping towards the evening. When I told my doctor this, he increased it to three pills a day without questioning anything. After a while that wasn’t enough either, so he raised it to five, and after some time the duration of effect which at first had lasted all day from a single pill dropped down to an hour. It wasn’t enough, and when the effect wore off, I wasn’t my normal self. I became extremely unhappy, joyless, and restless.

And then that day came: I started crushing it and snorting it. Yes, it was more effective, but the length of time it satisfied me had shrunk so much that I wouldn’t even go out for a coffee without it. I always had to have enough spare on me. My doctor, on the other hand, didn’t notice this situation at all and every time I went, he would write however many boxes I asked for, no questions asked. I was taking a whole box of Ritalin (30 pills) in a day and a half. I wasn’t myself anymore; it was obvious from the outside too. I had wasted away; from being a curvy girl, I’d dropped to a weight that looked sickly. I didn’t even remember most events, appointments, hangouts.

I became pathologically addicted to the computer game The Sims. Because you need to fixate on something. I was doing nothing but playing Sims. I would lock onto tiny details in the game and obsess over them for hours. After a while, with my then-boyfriend also telling her how bad things had gotten, my Ritalin prescriptions were cut off. For a while, since under the influence of the meds I had basically turned into a computer genius, I kept getting it illegally off the internet. But the amount of Ritalin I was consuming was too expensive to keep buying illegally. Plus, after a while I couldn’t find it anymore. For the first time, my body was going to experience being without Ritalin.

Look, this wasn’t depression, tiredness, or just feeling down. I literally couldn’t get up; I could barely walk to the bathroom. In the end, just to feel even a tiny bit better, I turned to alcohol. And in a very short time, because I was drinking non-stop all day, I became an alcoholic.

By some coincidence, one day, just out of boredom, I crushed and snorted a pill called Wellbutrin that my friend was taking. It gave me this ten-second fake stimulant high. But at least it made me feel something, and even just the act of crushing the pill and snorting it up my nose was exciting to me.

One day I had a seizure at home. Everyone was shocked, because I don’t have epilepsy and I had never had a seizure before. An ambulance came right away, we went to the hospital, I had a bunch of CT scans, X-rays, but nothing showed up; there was no reason visible for me to have had a seizure. I didn’t think of it the first time, but after it happened two or three more times, I decided to do some research and read that excessive bupropion use can cause seizures that can be fatal. The few seconds of dopamine high it gives you is so absurd and sick when you compare it to that side effect.

I had a seizure while driving on the highway in Istanbul, and I don’t even know how many times I had them in the street. I’ve had stitches in my head; I don’t remember how many spots on my body have how many different injuries. In total, it’s definitely more than twenty. My brain had basically stopped producing its own dopamine. I lost everything, I hurt a lot of people, I made a lot of mistakes. And now I absolutely cannot enjoy life without taking something extra from outside.

And the worst part is, one day when I was chatting with an older family member who’s a pharmacist and I mentioned the doctor’s name, they said, “Everyone knows him, his nickname is ‘The Butcher.’” This doctor, because he gets commissions from pharmaceutical companies, can, without batting an eye, prescribe drugs that can destroy people’s lives, completely disregarding their lives.

When the medication I had ran out, I turned to alcohol because my brain couldn’t release its own “happiness chemicals” anymore.

At first it started with stealing drinks from my grandfather’s cellar and hiding the bottles under my bed. Then my relationship ended too, on top of everything. And I discovered that drinking alone at home felt… weirdly comforting.

My days became nothing but drinking from the moment I woke up until I passed out watching series, scrolling online, just letting the day disappear. When my family realized what was happening, I went to rehab, but it didn’t change anything. Fifteen days after I got out, I drank again because I just wanted to feel happy.

Every bad decision I’ve ever made, I made while I was drunk: ridiculous tattoos, one-night stands, saying meaningless things to people. And now… I drink just to survive, just to feel something. I drink every moment I’m awake. I’ve reached a point where I need to have alcohol in me even to call someone I can’t get anything done without drinking first.

Even today, I took my dog out for just 20 minutes, and by the end I started sweating and shaking. My brain simply doesn’t produce happiness hormones on its own anymore. I would give anything to have my old brain back.

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

1qyk8gi,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1qyk8gi/anyone_here_tried_bleaching_w_or_l_or_thinking/,Anyone here tried bleaching? W or L? Or thinking about it?,"if you've ever stared at your reflection in the mirror, scrolling through TikTok or Insta pics of people with that fresh bleached hair vibe, and thought, ""Damn, that looks fire, but nah, it's probably a nightmare to maintain, or it'll fry my hair into a haystack, or worse, I'll look like a washed-out ghost afterward,"" then this post is for you. I'm here to drop some real talk on why you should just go for it, at least once. Trust me, I've been there, done that, and came out the other side looking sharper than ever. And no, I'm not some hair guru or sponsored by L'Oréal,  just a guy who's experimented, learned the hard way, and wants to save you from overthinking it.

First off, let's address the big fears head-on because I know they're legit. High maintenance? Yeah, it can be, but it's not the end of the world. Bleaching lifts the color from your hair, so it needs some TLC afterward, think purple shampoo to keep brassiness at bay (like once or twice a week, not every shower), deep conditioning masks maybe every other wash, and avoiding heat tools if you can. But here's the logic: if you're already spending time styling your hair every day (admit it, we all do), swapping in a couple extra steps isn't gonna kill your routine. It's like leveling up your skincare game, at first, it's ""ugh, another product?"" but then it becomes second nature, and your hair thanks you by staying soft and not snapping like overcooked spaghetti. Pro tip: start with a professional if you're new; DIY kits are tempting but can turn into a comedy of errors (ask me about the time I ended up with orange roots, hilarious in hindsight, but not mid-process).

Now, the ""it won't look good"" myth. Bro, most people who bleach for the first time freak out because it's a change. Your brain's wired to love the familiar, so when you go from dark brown to platinum or honey blonde, it feels weird. Like, ""Who is this stranger in the mirror?"" But give it a week or two, and bam, it starts to suit you. I've seen it on friends, on myself: it usually comes out nice, even if it's not perfect. Why? Because bleaching opens up your look, it brightens your face, makes your eyes pop, and gives off that effortless cool factor. Not everyone's gonna turn into a K-pop idol overnight, but 9 times out of 10, it enhances what you've got. And if it doesn't? Hair grows back, dyes fade, or you can tone it down. No permanent damage to your ego or your strands if you do it right.

But here's the real gem, the part that surprised me the most: the confidence boost. At first, yeah, you might hide under a hat or spam selfies on social media for validation (guilty as charged). Social media's a highlight reel, likes and comments feel good, but they're surface-level. The magic happens IRL. When you're out there, chatting with people at school, parties, or just grabbing coffee, that bleached hair becomes a conversation starter. ""Dude, your hair's sick,  how'd you do it?"" Suddenly, you're the guy with the bold move, not the one blending into the background. It builds this quiet confidence over time because you've taken a risk, owned it, and realized most people dig it (or at least respect the guts). It's like upgrading from side character to main protagonist in your own life. Funny story: first week after I bleached mine, I felt like everyone was staring (paranoia level 100). Turns out, they were, but in a good way. Landed me a date I wasn't even chasing. Coincidence? Maybe, but confidence is magnetic.

Look, I'm not saying bleach your hair and become a supermodel overnight, that's BS. But if you've been curious, stop letting fear hold you back. Life's too short for ""what ifs,"" especially in our teens when experimenting is basically the job description. Do your research (patch test for allergies, folks, safety first), budget for it if needed, and just try it. Worst case? You learn something new about yourself. Best case? You unlock a version of you that's a little edgier, a lot more fun, and way more confident in the real world.

Who's with me? Drop your bleached hair stories below, successes, fails, or ""should I do it?"" dilemmas. Let's turn this thread into a glow-up support group.

TL;DR: Bleach it if you're tempted. It's maintainable, usually looks dope after the initial shock, and builds IRL confidence like nothing else. Be bold, teens 👊🏻",1,1770486362.0,teenagers,0,1.0,False

Screaming Trevor as he was yelling so hard his veins were literally set to pop out his chest . The crazy thing was that Trevor was staring at his coffee the whole time. Other patrons looked and were quite befuddled. Miranda a few chairs down, grew very afraid but intrigued at the same time. Trevor then got up and was running around like his table like a mad man. An elderly woman couldn't believe it , so she put on her reading glasses and let out ""Dear God that boy is going mad"". Trevor was now crying while yelling "" Marty biscuits no I don't want the devil's butter on my sausages this time, please dear God just hot sauce"".  An asshole high school student started bursting up laughing and hitting the table with his hands as if God told him the funniest joke of all time . Larissa the barista just stood there , forgetting to make the orders, and stood in complete shock. Her co-worker then tapped her on the shoulder and uttered "" Hey he's going nuts but we still have to do our jobs you know"". Larissa nodded and began working. 

Trevor then stopped running, then began doing jumping jacks cheering on for some reason while saying "" Yeah let's go horn froggers!, it's our  year to win the state championship, I want that turkey!!!"". Kristy, a regular at Joe's Coffee shop, nodded while saying under her breath "" Well at least he's cheering on his invisible team this time"". 

A random patron walked in and played loud pop music . Trevor sprang up quicker than a bed spring. He then started dancing as if his life depended on it . The patron who just walked in, turned up the music then stood right next to the dancing Trevor and proudly explained "" Courtesy of rock out studios brought to you by Larry, if it ain't dance worthy then it's a now show bro"". About five seats down was John. ""Got dam hippies and their acid music"", said John as he was shaking his head as if he saw something despicable .  

Five minutes later, the music stopped. The random patron then jetted out of the coffee shop as if a bomb was discovered . Chris, the worker that's been there at Joe's Coffee shop for two weeks,  who was sweeping near the checkout area just said "" Well that was weird."" Shook his head and continued sweeping . 

Trevor then got up, sat down and downed his coffee . Shockingly, the coffee was hotter than hell. Trevor then slammed the coffee cup on the table and screamed "" That's how you pump gasoline Barry!"" The high schooler that was an asshole started laughing so hard, even the manager Trent could hear from his managerial room.  The high schooler walked up while laughing hysterically and gave Trevor a high five. 

20 minutes later, Trevor ordered another cup of coffee. He slipped it slow this time. Then out of nowhere he said ""Yeah Dan, the business deal won't be complete until you sign on the dotted line, sure the risk is great, but the reward is greater"". Zack who just moved into town a month ago just looked puzzled and said out loud "" Now he's conducting a business deal!?"" Jenny who occasionally visits Joe's Coffee shop , didn't pay him any mind was too busy reading about the latest celebrity gossip and inside info on stocks and bonds . 

30 minutes later, a woman rushed in. The doors opened so violently. The lady walked straight up to Trevor and slammed a pill bottle on the table and screamed so loud that even St. Peter would have to cover his ears, "" Take your damn meds, or else no cheeseburgers for dinner!"" Trevor looked as if the woman stole his favorite puppy. The lady then opened up the pill bottle and placed two pills on the table and stormed out. As soon as she stormed out Trevor took the pills quickly . 

Every other patron now knew Trevor was off his rocker . And sure enough Trevor was quite as a mouse for the rest of the time. Every other patron resumed what they were doing before Trevor went mad. Soon, Trevor got up and headed out the door. Before he opened the door, he let out a sigh and uttered "" Sorry horn froggers no turkey this time man"". Then left. 

Now everyone at Joe's Coffee shop was a bit bummed out . 

Two weeks later, the same patrons were at Joe's Coffee shop . Everyone was bored and missing Trevor, even the disgruntled old man. Then suddenly, the doors swung open and it was the one and only Trevor screaming with so much vigor "" Let's go horn froggers we are down by five points but our Quarterback will win us that turkey!""

 Every patron got up and clapped and said in proud unison "" Let's go horn froggers!""

Installed the SoC PID. Had it in the cupboard since November. I know people now have Gaggimate etc... but hey... This is the first time I open the Gaggia up (a part for OPV). I am not technical. However I managed it. Took me almost 5 hours. I made 2 annoying mistakes.

    I left a grommet that needed to be put when screwing the probe (probably would work without but I could not help myself)... Which meant I had to undo the boiler etc... pain! Note that in the e24 I undid the boiler as well as removed the steam wand to get space to put the probe in. I wonder if you get the space without having to undo the pump assembly (which is some extra faff).

    I read about threading the cables... So I put them through the case hole. I read the section on threading through the box and it sorta of gave the option of thread it later... Anyway. I was eager started to do all the cabling and at the end, I realized I needed to disconnect all the wires from the PID to put through the box. Honestly they should put a big box stating to thread before wiring.

It is an ok job, fiddly at times (stupid things like screwing the 2 little boxes on the case with the little bolt, position of the steam ssr (had to undo it as it hit the funnel... The realized there was a plastic thing on it)

She stood without protest, smiled grimly at the others, and nodded once. It was not reassurance and not farewell. Then the door shut, and she was gone.

Hours passed, or maybe it was less. Time did not behave properly here. Eventually, a surly woman opened the door and jerked her chin. “You. Teacher.”

The history teacher stood slowly.

“This detention is illegal,” she said quietly. “You know that.”

The guard snorted. “You were free to leave. You were never detained.”

The teacher glanced at the locked door. “The door says otherwise.”

The guard smirked, a small, satisfied thing, and motioned her out, then the door closed again.

Faye was alone.

For the first time since her arrest, the room felt too small. She slipped sideways into the Null, not to hide and not to flee, just to breathe. The porch was already there. It hovered in the emptiness of Null, complete and unfinished at the same time. Gray boards and a swing hung from chains that disappeared upward into nothing, with no house behind it. There was no yard, just the step, the railing, and the long drop of unmade space beyond.

Faye sat on the swing with her knees drawn up, rocking slowly. She did not notice at first when the other weight settled beside her. The swing creaked in a way that was familiar, so familiar.

“You always did that when you didn’t want to hear me,” Frances said mildly.

Faye’s breath caught. She did not turn her head, afraid her mother would disappear if she did.

“I’m not,” she began, then stopped. There was no point lying here. “I’m listening.”

Frances smiled, just a little.

She wore the clothes she always had in Faye’s memory. Sensible shoes, a skirt below the knee, a cardigan that had seen better decades. She looked solid and real, not young, not old. Exactly herself.

Faye looked quickly then stared at her hands instead, where between her fingers, something took shape. Gold flowed like softened wax, obedient and precise. A setting formed, and tiny claws. A curve where light would catch. She set a stone, then another, each one perfect, each one unnecessary but opulently perfect.

Frances watched her work.

“You know,” Frances said, rocking gently with the swing, “nothing I ever helped build happened fast.”

Faye adjusted a facet too sharply, so she smoothed it.

“People are being hurt now.”

“Yes,” Frances said. “They always are.”

Faye’s jaw tightened.

“The New Deal didn’t come from one law,” Frances went on. “It came from a hundred small ones. Some failed and some were ugly. Some were compromises I hated.”

Faye snorted despite herself. “You?”

“Oh, especially me,” Frances said. “I hated means-testing. I hated how long everything took. I hated watching people suffer while committees argued.”

Faye set the brooch down on her palm, examined it, then began again, refining what did not need refining.

“But,” Frances said, “it worked because it wasn’t magic.”

Faye glanced up at that.

“It worked,” Frances continued, “because people learned how to use it, and then they learned how to defend it. Unions, Social Security, unemployment benefits were all fought for because it was part of their lives and their jobs. Their doctors. Their parents’ pensions.”

She looked out into the gray distance, as if seeing factories that no longer existed.

“You don’t give people justice,” Frances said. “You give them institutions, and time, and the habit of expecting better. The people have to fight for it. They need to demand it.”

Faye’s fingers stilled for just a moment.

“That takes too long,” she said quietly.

“Yes,” Frances replied. “That’s part of the price.”

The swing rocked once then twice.

“You can’t fix a country the way you fix a wound,” Frances said. “You can’t cauterize it and call it healed. You have to rebuild the muscles and the bones. You have to let it ache while it gets stronger. It has to hurt so much that the people demand it.”

Faye picked the brooch up again and added another tiny flourish no one would ever notice.

“They need safety nets,” Frances said. “Universal ones. Not charity and not punishment. They need things people don’t have to prove they deserve.”

“I know,” Faye said quickly.

“Jobs that don’t vanish when the market sneezes,” Frances went on. “Healthcare that doesn’t depend on obedience. Education that teaches people how systems work, not just how to survive them.”

“I know,” Faye said again, sharper this time and tears rolled down her cheeks.

“And above all,” Frances said gently, “you need people to do the work. Millions of them. People in boring meetings drinking bad coffee to stay on task and years of showing up even when it feels useless.  You need people protesting and striking even if it hurts them terribly. Everyone voting.”

“But Mom, they burned it all to the ground,” Faye said. “Everything you did. They destroyed it slowly, then faster. The people will hurt so much if they fight back. The people will hurt more than the ones they’re fighting.” She choked back sobs, sad and angry at the same time. “It’s worse than you remember.”

Frances turned then, really looking at her.

“It’s worse for some, yes,” Frances said. “But for others, it’s been pain and work and walls the whole time. And yes, the only way to get there is individual people being willing to suffer and sacrifice more than they should so future generations won’t have to. They need to have general strikes and support determined public servants. Find politicians with integrity and determination and wealthy people who fund the fight.”

Faye sobbed hard now, and she felt Frances’s arm on her shoulder, lightly, there and not there.

They sat for a moment, quiet, but Faye still held what she had formed in her hand.

Frances turned Faye’s hand to see what it held.

“It’s pretty,” Frances said. “And it will work for a little while. But if it depends on you…” She paused. “It will die when you leave.”

The words landed, heavy and true.

“Fighting for progress is never done. When you stop, they take progress away and then you have to claw your way up from the bottom again.”

Frances sighed.

Faye’s hands clenched around the brooch. For a moment, the gold threatened to crumple under her grip. She forced it still.

“I can’t wait that long,” Faye said.

Frances nodded. Her face held no surprise and no anger.

“I know,” she said. “You’re still so young.”

They sat together, rocking in the emptiness.

“You understand the plan,” Frances said. “That’s enough for me.”

Faye swallowed. “Then why tell me?”

“So you’ll know,” Frances said, “that what you’re about to do is not the only way. The only way that lasts is a continuous push by the people themselves.”

Faye looked down at the brooch, flawless, excessive,  and made in minutes.

She closed her fingers around it.

“I’ll put it back,” she said. “After we get a leg up.”

Frances smiled, sad and proud all at once.

“Everyone thinks that.”

The porch creaked. The Null held its breath as somewhere far away, in the human world, the long, slow work waited, unseen, unfinished, and so very necessary.

When I rushed down to city hall to get a replacement, the clerk dropped a bombshell: 

""Ma'am, this certificate is fake."" 

I stormed back to the office, ready to confront Matthias Keane. 

Instead, I walked in on him pinning the intern against his office door, kissing her. 

""Oh baby, I've been fighting with her for five years, but I've been crazy about you for ten."" 

""Our real marriage certificate, I've got it locked away safe and sound in my private vault."" 

When that same intern pushed me down the stairwell, Matthias just stood there, watching coldly. 

He wrapped his precious baby in his arms, voice all soft and protective. 

""Hey, don't look at that mess, sweetheart. You know blood makes you ill."" 

Later, the delayed medical response left me with severe brain trauma. 

When I finally woke up,my memories stopped to the year I absolutely despised him most.

Two days after surgery, Matthias finally show up.

I was joking around with one of the nurses when he walked in. The smile died on my face the moment I saw him.

""What are you doing here?""

Matthias glanced at the bandage on my forehead, then let out this cold laugh. ""Calla's been worried about you for two days, and here you are putting on some act?""

Before I could even figure out what he meant, he stormed over.

He reached out and yanked my IV line hardly.

The needle tore out of my arm and I drew in a sharp breath from the pain.

Blood went everywhere. The nurse next to me let out a shriek and rushed to stop the bleeding.

Once it hit me what he'd done, I slapped him across the face as hard as I could.

""What is wrong with you? Did you die badly in a past life or something?""

""Are you completely blind? Can't you see the bandages on my head?""

When I first started at the company, that was when Matthias and I hated each other most.

He'd call me a stick-in-the-mud with no personality. I'd tell him he was worse than a thug.

Every conversation started with us basically cursing each other to go to he//ll.

The slap knocked his head sideways. He looked absolutely shocked.

He just stood there, speechless, but I wasn't about to let him off the hook.

After the nurse got my hand bandaged up, I stared Matthias down.

I was about to call security to throw him out.

Then another nurse rushed in and said something that made my blood run cold.

""Mr. Keane, could you sign here in the family section for Ms. Marchand?""

Before Matthias could say anything, I grabbed the clipboard.

""Sign what? He's not family.""

But when I looked at the form, the words stuck in my throat.

Right there in the spouse box was Matthias Keane's name.

Seeing my reaction, Matthias rubbed his forehead.

""Look, I know you're pissed about Calla, but her mom's dying. Her last wish is to see Calla get married.""

""Calla and I grew up together. I'm the obvious choice. After... after her mom passes, we'll get divorced.""

My hands were shaking as I pulled out my phone.

There it was - ""Hubby"" at the top of my contacts with Matthias's same old profile pic.

But in the company group chat, intern Calla Merrin had matching couple avatars with him.

【Getting married next month! You're all invited to the wedding! 】

She'd posted a picture but deleted it seconds later. Too late - I'd already screenshot it.

It was a wedding photo of them. Matthias looking at her like she hung the moon.

The group chat was going crazy, but I couldn't stomach reading any more.

I didn't have a single photo of Matthias and me together in my phone.

The doctor said the head injury left me with some complications.

I'd lost five years of memories.

I was still trying to wrap my head around apparently being married to my nemesis.

And now I'm looking at his wedding photo with someone else.

That's when a text popped up.

From my friend Jessi who works at city hall.

""Hey, about that background check on Matthias Keane you asked for. He got married a year ago.""

""Spouse is listed as Calla Merrin.""

""That certificate you showed me was fake - no official seal. Not legally binding.""

Reading that last line felt like someone drove a knife straight through my heart.

My head started pounding, everything getting fuzzy and painful.

All these leftover feelings crashed over me like a wave, making my nose sting with tears.

I was quiet for so long that Matthias must have thought I was giving in.

He frowned and stepped closer, like he was going to reach for me.

""You...""

Matthias looked completely lost, like he had no clue how to explain this mess.

Makes sense. We'd been enemies for so long, always at each other's throats.

No wonder falling for him seemed so ridiculous.

I took a deep breath. When I looked up again, my face was stone cold.

""Don't you know office relationships are against company policy?""

Our last conversation ended with Calla calling.

Matthias was about to explain something to me when her sobbing pulled him away.

He rushed out with a quick ""Wait for me"" and never came back.

I handled my own discharge paperwork and packed up my stuff alone.

One of the young nurses felt bad for me and helped out, grumbling the whole time.

""He claims to be your family, but where is he when you actually need him?""

She was pissed on my behalf, but honestly, I didn't care anymore.

Lucky for me, I never change my passwords, so my phone still worked fine.

I found my new house address in my notes app and took a cab over.

On my way out after unpacking, the owner of the coffee shop downstairs called out, ""The usual?""

I said yes without thinking.

Before I knew it, I was holding two breakfast sandwiches.

Veggie wraps. I hate vegetables.

The second I walked into the office, a coworker teased me, ""Bringing breakfast for Keane again?""

Before he'd even finished talking, someone snatched them right out of my hands.

Calla's face lit up. ""Oh Evelina, you're the best! I absolutely love the veggie wraps from that place.""

Her fake-sweet tone made me frown.

I grabbed the wraps back and handed them to my coworker, raising an eyebrow.

""These are for you. Careful not to let the fake bit//ch contaminate them.""

He just stood there stunned, but before he could react, Matthias walked over.

First, he pulled red-eyed Calla behind him protectively.

Then he looked down at me.

""Just because Calla and I have the same taste in food, you're gonna take it out on her?""

The colleagues who'd been enjoying the drama went quiet after that.

They kept giving us weird looks, glancing between the three of us.

Makes sense - the two main players in this mess had already been the hot topic of the office since yesterday.

I stayed quiet too long. Someone was about to step in and defend me.

But before she could say anything, Calla started crying again.

All tears and trembling, looking absolutely pitiful. ""I didn't know you'd started liking that flavor too after I left.""

""When I saw the familiar packaging, I thought Evelina had brought them for me.""

Matthias shot me a warning look, then turned to gently wipe her tears.

I stared at the watch on his wrist, couldn't look away.

I'd seen the exact same one on the nightstand at home. The women's version.

By the time I snapped out of it, Calla was saying""If it bothers you, I can apologize.""

The fake sweetness was making me sick. Reminded me of those manipulative bit//ches I used to rant about for days.

I blinked and said, ""Then apologize.""

Calla choked on her words. Even stopped crying.

I smoothed out my expression and pointed to the name tag.

""You're an intern. Do you really want to mess with manager?""

""I know you're straightforward, but you don't have to be a complete bit//ch about it.""

I emphasized the word ""manager.""

According to company rules, Calla should've been fired.

Matthias took the fall for her, got himself demoted to save her job.

I sighed, couldn't understand why he was being so stupid.

Last night I'd stayed up reading through all our old text messages.

That's how I found out we'd been having some secret relationship for three years.

Matthias never once made us public.

Now watching him protect Calla like this, I had mixed feelings about the whole thing.

But I kept my face neutral and picked up a box, handing it to Matthias with a smile.

""Hey Matty, better get moving to your new desk.""

I never thought about quitting.

After all, I wasn't the one who screwed up. No reason I should have to leave.

But when I was heading out after work, Matthias stopped me.

He looked conflicted, muttering to himself, ""Are you still mad? I didn't know you were getting discharged today.""

""I had no idea Calla was gonna post that wedding announcement in the company chat. It was an accident.""

I gave him a look and my mouth ran faster than my brain.

""You're so good at passing the buck, you should've been a politician instead.""

""Really treating people like they're fools and don't know any better. Such an 'accident.'""

I hadn't been this sarcastic in ages. Matthias just stared at me, stunned.

He glanced at me, like something occurred to him. ""How's your injury?""

The back of my head was still wrapped in gauze. Couldn't see what was underneath.

When Matthias brought it up, I hesitated for a moment.

I didn't want him to keep bugging me, so I was about to tell him about the memory loss.

But then Calla came running over and grabbed onto his arm.

""You promised we'd go to dinner together. I've been waiting forever.""

Her attempt to change the subject was so obvious, but it worked on Matthias.

He told her not to make a scene, but his feet were already turning toward her.

Before leaving, he tossed me a box, looking like he wanted to say something but couldn't find the words.

I opened it. Inside was a necklace.

The diamond in the center was about the size of my pinky nail.

I snapped the box shut like it bu//rned me. Just as I was about to chase after them, I saw Calla turn her head.

She casually showed off her hand, flashing a rock the size of a pigeon egg on her finger.

""I've been wearing the ring from when you proposed in front of my mom this whole time.""

""Mom said we should visit her together next weekend.""

I instinctively looked down at my own ring finger.

No ring. No tan line either.

They drove off, and I was still standing there like a fool.

A coworker walked by and said hi.

""Finally gonna get rid of Calla Merrin, huh? Do you know how much trouble she's caused?""

I mumbled agreement, looking down at the papers I'd been clutching.

Calla had been assigned to Matthias's team as an intern.

Now that Matthias's authority had been transferred to me.

The first thing I did was terminate Calla's employment contract.

I thought about it for a moment, then sent Calla a message.

The next second, she sent back a photo.

That ring-covered hand holding a bouquet of roses, with the corner of a man's suit jacket barely visible.

I'd just typed back a question mark when Calla posted boldly in the company group chat.

""Don't understand why some people insist on trying to be a homewrecker.""

""I made that announcement specifically to warn certain people, but they're still hanging around.""

People started gossiping immediately, but I just laughed coldly.

If she wouldn't listen, then I didn't need to keep trying.

I blocked Calla.

She went quiet for a while, probably waiting for a response.

When my phone lit up again, it was Matthias who has been pissed off.

""Why did you block Calla? Can you stop being such a brat?""

When I didn't respond, he threatened me""Add her back, or I'll call you out in front of everyone.""

Matthias was counting on me not wanting to cause a scene over something so petty.

But I just sent him a few lines.

""Didn't the doctor tell you, as my 'family,' that I lost five years of memory?""

""Don't worry, you'll be joining your precious Calla soon enough.""

The next second, I texted my brother Noel Marchand.

""Your sister's getting screwed over at her own company. Time to come.""",1,1770486011.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False
1qyk2ny,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qyk2ny,"SOTC: The only stainless/semi-stainless kitchen knives that stuck (Ashi, Kyuzo, Yoshikane)","Hello again TCK!

I had some time this morning, was drinking coffee while looking at my knives (as one does) and I was thinking about the three stainless or semi-stainless kitchen knives that managed to stick in the collection despite my bias toward carbon steel. 

So I figured I might as well take them off the wall, take a couple pictures and ramble a bit on Reddit about this stainless-ish trio of knives that are helping me challenge my bias.

**Rule 5 (L-R):**

* Ashi Hamono Ginga AEB-L (Swedish Stainless) Gyuto 270
* Hitohira Kikuchiyo Kyuzo Ginsan Gyuto 240 (S. Nakagawa x T. Yauchi)
* Yoshikane Hamono Nashiji SKD Nakiri 165

Alright let's fucking ramble...

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# What makes these three different?

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

There is no beating around the bush (and many of you know this): I have a heavy bias toward carbon steel kitchen knives. 

There is something about enjoying the patina evolve, the way they sharpen, and the edge I can achieve with carbon steel that makes me reach for them over other knives. I've actively try to challenge this bias, but usually to no avail and at no fault of the makers themselves. 

I had a Kagekiyo Nakagawa x Myojin Ginsan Gyuto 210 that I just never reached for which eventually was sold to fund my Takada no Hamono Singetu Shirogami #2 Gyuto 210. 

My Nakagawa x Tadokoro Ginsan Gyuto 240 was wonderful, but was never used as much as its carbon steel Sakai Wide Bevell counterparts I already had. 

Even my Matsubara Ginsan Honesuki 150 eventually was sold because I prefer my Togashi Shirogami #2 Deba. 

One after another, stainless was replaced with carbon steel, but these three stainless/semi-stainless that have stuck. There are different reasons for each, but I feel I owe it to each knife to talk about them individually as opposed to grouped because they share a similar steel trait. Afterwards, I will toss in details for each knife as well as previous links if someone wants to read up more about any of them.

\---------------------------------------------------

**Ashi Hamono Ginga AEB-L (Swedish Stainless) Gyuto 270mm**

There is nothing to say about Ashi that has not already been said, but I don't care and this is a ramble session so fuck it.

For me, its use case is my tough-as-fuck stainless gyuto when I simply need performance and no additional considerations. The grind is heavenly in that it glides through food, but without many of the usual sacrifices. It has better-than-expected food release, it is not a delicate edge thanks to the extremely tough AEB-L, and there is no ""stiction"" from overly flat bevels. 

It also has my favorite profile on a knife. There is a \~30% flat spot at the heel, but it rocks for days beyond that. The tip is also a perfect shape for pull cuts or when using it as a big slicer. It even sneaks above 50mm tall at the heel. And despite being a 270mm gyuto, it weighs just 167g and is nimble enough for small and precise tasks. There is just nothing this knife cannot do. Also, shoutout Ashi handles and saya; both of mine are extremely well made; as is the somewhat simplistic fit-and-finish. Lastly, the AEB-L steel has only lightly rolled despite me using this for all tough tasks. This is ideal because the steel is so easy to sharpen on stones and the rolls just fall right back in line. Its also the only stainless steel that has agreed with my Aizu Japanese natural stone.

I've said this before, but Ashi knives are full of contradictions in the best way. It astounds me how ideal this knife is when focusing solely on performance. 

\---------------------------------------------------

**Hitohira Kikuchiyo Kyuzo Ginsan Gyuto 210mm (S. Nakagawa x T. Yauchi)**

This is my newest knife and I've had it for about two-and-a-half months now so, while it feels like a knife that will be with me for a very long time, it has not proven to be a mainstay in the rotation like the other two have.

Still, the hype about Kikuchiyo Kyuzo Ginsan Gyutos has held up for me. I love me a Sakai Wide Bevel too which makes the fit even easier. But what surprised me are the reasons I've bonded with it so much.

First reason is the use case. When I just want to cook a quick meal for my partner and I, this Kikuchiyo Kyuzo can just do everything so easily without taking up a lot of space. I can use bigger knives in my kitchen thankfully, but our apartment is still small so having a grab-and-go elite-performing stainless 210 gyuto is a really nice option and I've found myself reaching for it. A cherry on top here is the utterly flawless Ho Wood handle. That might be overlooked, but there is not a rough spot on this handle, it makes for perfect balance and it weirdly matches the incredible looks, which brings us to the second reason...

This knife is god damn stunning. I have some pretty knives, but this kasumi and this shape and this handle with this kanji has really became a stunning package. 

The stainless kasumi is truly the best I've seen and when it catches the light, I do not think I have anything that competes with it. The height of the bevel paired with the migaki finish on the hira is so well done it almost reflects as fully black when there is no light to catch; it's a stunning effect (I'll add a picture in the comments). This knife would not have looked as crisp and elegant with a black-filled kanji either. The classic Hitohira kanji allows it to play with the light the same way the rest of the hira does. And again, that handle looks so good on it. I was considering changing the handle when I first got it, but I think that would be a mistake now.

It's really a spectacular knife. I'm having a hard time envisioning the collection without it these days.

\---------------------------------------------------

**Yoshikane Hamono SKD Stainless Steel Clad Nakiri 165mm**

First things first; this is my partner's first-ever Japanese kitchen knife and it's the longest-lasting knife in our collection. She will never sell it nor will she allow me to sell it so regardless what I think, it will be with us for good.

Thankfully, she is right; this Yoshikane Nashiji SKD Nakiri is outstanding. They know what the fuck they are doing at Yoshikane and I still think they deserve more flowers for the level of product they are producing at such scale with such attainable prices.

First, the SKD steel really holds an edge so well for how easy it is to sharpen. That is quite a mythical combo and is very very impressive to me. I've only had to touch it up twice and it's been used very often for about a year now.

I also think the fit and finish also deserves more praise. It is not the same Sakai perfection, but quite stunning in its own right. The nashiji is light and refined, but unmistakeable. The kasumi is good, but the magic is the polish core steel and cladding that sandwich the cladding line giving you that lightening bolt across the kireha. Also shoutout Carbon Knife Co. for the burnt chestnut handle; it's extremely good.

And it can fucking cut. Profile and tip makes it a dream to rock or push cut. This baby gets used for everything too; halving sandwiches, veggie prep, dedicated fruit slicer, and a bunch of other odd jobs.

For someone thinking about trying a Nakiri, this is a great option.

Thanks for reading! It was nice to sit down and do some writing on a Saturday morning; it can be quieter around here on the weekends so I figured why not squeeze in a Stainless Steel Saturday or whatever the fuck this is. Hopefully it was helpful or informative at least lol

1qyk2bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1qyk2bj/almost_1_year_sober_how_my_brain_has_changed/,"Almost 1 Year Sober, how my brain has changed","Been on my sober journey for 3 years. The first two years I had streaks of sobriety that were sprinkled with hard relapses. IV hydration infusions, calls to the mental health crisis hotline, hard. Getting sober initially was not my choice. My life was a mess and alcohol was removed from me. I got my life together in my sober periods, and would let loose and relapse because I felt I earned it. About a year ago, I went through the same song and dance. I woke up from a night out, finished an opened beer instead of having my morning coffee, and lay on the couch detoxing for the rest of the day in preparation for work the next morning, promising myself I wouldn’t drink for a while after. For some reason, this time getting sober stuck. I reframed my thinking about alcohol. No longer did I view alcohol as a way to unwind. It clicked that alcohol is a destructive poison that will ruin my life if I consume it, as it had in the past. There is no such thing as moderation, even for “normal” drinkers. 

I became open about my feelings and struggles with alcohol with everyone. I no longer felt shame about how dark my life got when i was deep in addiction. I accepted the fact that I used it to numb my deep rooted unhappiness with my life. I no longer felt emotionally attached to the horrible mistakes and actions I did while drunk. Which for someone with anxiety I thought was impossible. Ironically, getting sober gave me the mental clarity and energy to make positive and substantial changes in my life where I am now deeply satisfied with my life and don’t need to fall back on a substance to make me numb. I have talked with friends and family about my views on alcohol, watching them also begin moderating or even cut out drinking completely too. 

This sub has been there for me this entire time and every person here has been an inspiration to me to keep on this journey. If you are reading this, struggling through cravings or withdrawals, I want you to know it gets better and you have support here. Our minds and bodies are incredible and flexible and we can change and heal. The shame goes away eventually. People forgive you eventually. Each positive change and action is a brick in the road on the path to recovery. IWNDWYT, or ever again. ",5,1770485975.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False
1qyk28a,https://www.reddit.com/r/omnifocus/comments/1qyk28a/ai_adventures_in_things_that_i_bet_omnifocus_can/,AI Adventures In Things that I bet Omnifocus can do too: Sorting the Inbox,"I've been experimenting with AI in Things, trying to add one new AI-based skill each week that gives me real benefit and saves time in how I use it. The one from this morning is a doozy! You're going to want to stop and read this!

Three things to note for context:

1. I'm using Claude AI by Anthropic. $20 per month. It includes Chat, Cowork, and Code. I use the first two. Did this through Chat. Code is completely beyond me.
2. I'm a heavy task user. At the highest level, I have a group of tags called ""area"". The three major tags under this are for personal work and involvement tasks. Every task gets one of these tags, allowing me to filter the today view by one and only see the area I want to be focused on.
3. I use wisperflow for AI-enhanced dictation, so I can talk to Claude and do all of this very quickly.

I sat down this morning at the end of the week and realized I had 42 tasks to process in my Inbox. I have a lot to get done today, and really did not want to take the time. So I tried prompting Claude with the following prompt:

""I would like you to go into my inbox in the Things app. I have 42 unsorted tasks there. Considering the content of the tasks and the structure of my lists, and the examples of other tasks that I've already put in their proper list, please go ahead and add one tag to each of these for the area you think it belongs in. The three tags I am wanting them tagged with are: ""p"" for personal tasks, ""w"" for work tasks, and ""i"" for involvements. Every task in here will fall under one of those three categories.""

Claude got this almost perfect, properly tagging 40 out of 42 tasks. The two that it didn't tag properly were unclear, and I can see why it didn't know exactly how to tag them. I ended up with 19 work tasks, 14 personal tasks, and 9 involvement tasks. Already, this was going to make processing them a lot easier and faster. Interestingly, when I told it how it had done, it wanted to know which tasks it got wrong and get an explanation of why it was wrong. It then gave feedback about what it was thinking and how it now understood why I tagged them the way I did.

Based on that success, I gave it a follow-on prompt:

""This was super helpful and saved me a lot of time. I will be turning to you regularly to help me with this. Since you did such a great job on it, why don’t you take a second pass through the tasks in my inbox and apply any other tags that you feel are appropriate? Don’t go overboard, keep it to no more than four tags total. For example, if a task references calling someone, you can apply the "":call"" tag for ""Call"". Another example is if something references a bill that needs to be paid, you can use the "" pay"" tag. If something references the need to schedule a meeting with someone, You can use the ""  schedule"" tag. These are just a few examples to give you the idea.

When you see punctuation before one of the tag groups, such as the "":"" in front of coms (for communications) or the ""|"" in front of status (for the status of tasks), those punctuation marks are only there to make it easy to type in the single punctuation mark and pull up all the choices in that group. I don't want you to be confused by why they're there.""

It went through and made very logical tag additions and didn't go overboard. Some tasks had one tag added, some two, but that was about it. They were absolutely tags that I might use if I were inclined to add them. The only mistake was in how it wrote tags in Things. It accidentally took those high-level area tags and mushed the other tags together with them, so they were one big new tag. I explained that it should not create any new tags and should go back and separate those so they were distinct, separate tags from my existing tags. It did that flawlessly.

It then asked me if I wanted a summary organized either by area or by the tag types. I declined as I was already looking at them in the inbox. It then summarized what it had learned so far.

https://preview.redd.it/9c8nslmrz3ig1.png?width=1940&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7bab42c7430ddde065f7257b7f367ac26bae2e9

**NOTE: I've switched to and used Omni Focus for periods of time, many times over the years. I always end up back at Things. I offer this because I imagine it can be done in Omni Focus and just as big of a benefit to most people.** 

I tried the third step of asking it to group the tasks in my inbox by the high-level area, so that all of my work tasks would be grouped at the top, my personal tasks in the middle, and my involvement tasks in the bottom.

""I would like to have you try doing one last thing using those top three high-level area tags of ""p"" for personal tasks, ""w"" for work tasks, and ""i"" for involvements, Please move the tasks around in my inbox so that they are grouped with work tasks coming first, personal tasks coming second, and involvement tasks coming third.""

It tried using the move command to do that, but realized that that went to lists that couldn't find a way to manipulate them in the inbox in the way I was asking. This isn't a big deal since at this point I can just filter the inbox view by the relevant area tag and just see those. Suddenly, 42 tasks become much smaller chunks of tasks, all of which go to the same area of my lists and projects. It will be easy to work through those.

""No worries, I appreciate you giving it a try. We accomplished most of what I wanted to accomplish. Please note this conversation and important and save the process we've created together. I will probably use this process with you every day.

1. Tag all tasks in the inbox with the three high-level area tasks of ""p"" for personal tasks, ""w"" for work tasks, and ""i"" for involvements.
2. Go through it a second time to add secondary tags that are appropriate. Do not create new tags in the process. Keep tags distinct and hold it to maximum of three to four tasks total - no more.""

It summarized all that it learned, put the process in its own words, and added: ""I'll save this important workflow to my memory so I can help you with this daily!""

So, the next time I need to do this, I am going to reference what we did and ask it to repeat it again, referring to our ""daily inbox sorting sessions."" from now on, I will just do that and the initial pass of properly tagging everything in the inbox, and the secondary pass with specifics, will be all done. I've got to estimate that is at least a 5-10 minute savings per day, and it should make the next phase go all the quicker as I then just have to put them in their proper lists and projects. Consider my mind blown. I'm thrilled with the real-life power this is giving. If you just take a few minutes to sit there with your AI agent and walk it through the steps like this, giving it feedback, you'll make up that time in no time. This whole process took me no more than twenty minutes. Feel free to use my prompts, adjusted for your situation and tags, and you'll have a jump start.

**The goal:**  
Turn **$50 into $50K** by rolling over the full return on **one bet per day**.

**How it works:**

* Starting bankroll: **$50**
* **1 bet per day**
* I’ll bet the **full return** each time
* Target odds: **around -110** (no crazy parlays)
* Max length: **12 days**
* Every pick, bet slip, and recap will be posted here

**Important (aka the reality check):**  
This challenge *will* end eventually — that’s betting. There’s no pretending otherwise. If we miss on **Day 1**, I’ll simply restart the ladder and go again. No shame in needing a couple tries to get momentum (that’s half the fun, honestly).

This isn’t financial advice, a “lock,” or a guarantee — just a transparent experiment with a tiny starting bankroll and disciplined rules.

If you want to follow along, tail, fade, or just watch the math play out — you’re welcome here **😊**. I’ll keep everything clean, honest, and posted in real time.

occasionally, I wil need to use a peice of equipment near a women in the middle of her workout OR the actual piece of equipment itself.

Obviously, if she is in the middle of a workout I will wait and change up my workout, but sometimes they can be on the equiment for 15/20 minutes+ (and these are weighfliting machines, NOT treadmills etc).

so I will go up, when they are resting and ask how long she has - and about half the time I get a sense that they are annoyed that I asked them. A few times they'd just shake their heads on me with thier headphones on quickly.  (note the fitness center I go to is not one where people talk to each other - people keep to themselves, if that matters)

beacuase of this, Ive tried to be even more polite and just smile and try to ask very politely - sometimes waiting to see if they have noticed me - and then ask like ""im so so sory to bother you, but I was just wondering when you would be done with this"" almost in a very very agreeable manner (becuase of what happened above). Now, a few times they tell me ""hey, you can be more direct, I know its busy now and people are probably waiting"". one women even said ""Hey, let's be more assertive next time ok?""

This is even starting to extend to real life at coffee shops etc - I will like im bothering women by being next to them - usually if I dont ask sometimes I can tell they don't want me next to them (random strange guy). for example - I was at a bar waiting for a friend and the only spot to stand with a place to put my coat was next to two women having a conversation. I immediately felt like they were bothered and thought maybe I was trying to talk to them / hit on them - so I just said ""do you mind if I stand here and put my coat here while I wait for my friend to get here before we get our table?"" and then they eased up immediately and we actually started chatting.

1qyk0pm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qyk0pm,Review #24 - Abraham Bowman Oak Series: American Oak,"I can't claim to have tried a BTAC, Pappy, Michter's 20, or many of the world's top flight bourbons and ryes. Abraham Bowman American Oak is probably one of the most rare and comparable to those, of the limited releases I've ever tried. My buddy was able to win a bottle of this back in late 2024 and has graciously let me try it a few time, and I decided it was finally time to post a review of it.

The Abraham Bowman product within A Smith Bowman's lineup is just about as limited of a release as the Cask Strength Bowman bottles. Abraham Bowman is used as an experimental product line that tries different barrel oak types, aging techniques, and mash bills. Most recently, Abraham Bowman has been releasing a subcategory, the Oak Series. Starting with French Oak, they've released American Oak and Hungarian Oak as well. There are several, older releases as well that I've never heard of prior to researching this line for this review. Some releases such as the Coffee Finished Bourbon, Fourth Use Barrel, and Gingerbread Cocoa Finished Bourbon stand out as some really unique offerings. These usually go up for a lottery for about a week and the winners need to go to the Bowman Distillery to pick up their lottery winning.

A Smith Bowman is owned by Sazerac, meaning they’re a sister distillery of Buffalo Trace. The distillate comes from ‘a sister distillery’ (source: tour guide back in November 2024). However, the tour guide wouldn’t explicitly say whether or not it was BT. After a little research on old’ reliable, Google, it seems like it’s confirmed that the distillate comes from Buffalo Trace. Allegedly it’s neither Buffalo Trace’s mash bill #1 or #2, but is likely some mixture of the two. A Smith Bowman does distill the sourced distillate one more time in their own copper stills. A Smith Bowman uses Cumberland Cooperage, a cooperage that also supplies barrels to Buffalo Trace. Many claim to get a lot of similar notes when trying Bowman bourbons. With the distillery using the same juice and barrels, it makes sense why.

MSRP: \~$80.00. It looks like this goes for over $1,000 online right now.

Age Statement: 12 years old

ABV: 67.5% (135 proof)

Mash Bill: Likely some combination of Buffalo Trace's Mash Bill 1 & 2. If someone has more information I'd love to hear it.

Nose: I first get a strong coffee/chocolate flavor after letting this pour rest for a few minutes in a Glencairn. A second time around offers a bit more complexity, adding a red fruit, specifically cherry. For 135 proof, not a lot of burn on the nose.

Palate: Very strong flavors, not a ton of ethanol (just like the nose). The cherry turns into more of an apple, and the chocolate is amplified and mixed in with some brown sugar. Not as much coffee on the palate as the nose but it's still there.

Finish: One of the longer lasting finishes I've had in a cask strength product. Incredibly long lasting finish. The flavor lasts forever and a sip of this really coats your mouth for a while. The finish contains a lot of the same flavors, a little barrel tannin, coffee coming back to the forefront, and a little more fruit.

Overall, this is one of my favorite pours of all time. I kind of feel like this specific release of the Oak Series is as close to the Bowman Cask Strength that you can get. In fact, it's aged an additional 2 years compared to the CS release! This American Oak release is super rich, full of flavor, and at 135 proof, doesn't kill you with too much burn/ethanol. I will for sure be participating in any of the Bowman lotteries moving forward, hopefully I'll win a Cask Strength or future Abraham Bowman release one day! I'd rate this bottle as a 9 on the T8KE Scale.

Has anyone tried some of the harder to find A Smith Bowman bottles, like the Cask Strength or other Abraham Bowman bottles? Curious to hear if those other releases are as good.

Cheers!

I mean, theoretically speaking it’s a multi-dimensional optimization problem right? You could fix the time it runs through, “play” with the grind size, while maybe you keep amount same? Is this enough? I mean, you can do tons of things I think? Like this temperature surfing which apparently is needed.

I don’t want to repeat everything but I am naturally an extremely slow learner. Give me a wood craft job, attempt to learn piano, any sport, any game, any profession, and I’ll fail and not improve with certainty.

I am THAT incompetent, people usually don’t believe me before they experience what I do.

So does it even make sense to start then? I think in some sense it needs to be idiot-proof. I love good coffee but from all I heard I suddenly think, yikes, this will not be it. And spending 1k bucks at least for a proper setup (or automatic coffee machine grinds beans fresh, we buy expensive beans, so it’s

not even bad) that will just make me fail is not worth it.

1qyjy3r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qyjy3r,"My spreadsheets have reached their final form: Inventory, Market Watch, and Deck Building","Hello community, I've been using a spreadsheet to keep track of all my cards since OP09, which has always been a blessing for deck building. Since OP13, I've wanted to make something more polished for others to use, but the scope quickly snowballed when I started implementing scripts to import TCGPlayer information. While this spreadsheet is primarily purposed for players of the game, there are many features helpful for collectors. It's all free, but if you like what I do, please consider [buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/niamriva) :)

Introducing, *The One Sheet*, features include:

* **Inventory:** up to date master list of base rarity cards, including JP card leaks
* **Playset Tracker:** for those who compulsively hoard playsets of everything like me, this will show you all R / SR / SEC cards that you don't have a full playset of
* **Deck Builder:** copy-pasting in deck sim codes will give you a list of what cards you do/don't have, along a cost breakdown
* **TCGPlayer Searcher:** like searching on TCGPlayer, type in the card ID (*e.g. EB04-025*) or name (*e.g. One Piece Tin Pack Set Vol. 2*) and it'll bring up anything that matches that from TCGPlayer
* **Watchlist:** by putting in the TCGPlayer product ID (*e.g. 668671*), it'll populate the row with the card information, including median price, market price, and price changes over the last 24hr / 7 day / 30 days
* **Market Price Index:** this is a master list of all existing OPTCG products on TCGPlayer, including their product IDs, market price, etc. This serves as the backbone for many other sheet functions. Will self-update every 24 hours at midnight NZDT.
* **Price History:** this sheet records each product ID's market price every 24hrs to track price trends over 31 days

All prices are in $USD by default but can be changed by selecting the preferred currency. I'm regularly working on the sheet so let me know if there are any issues or features you'd like to see :)

Once I’m sure about you, I’ll be all in with my love and keep choosing you and making you happy.

Finding that someone is pretty hard, though. I’ve been searching for a while, and I still haven’t gotten a DM from you specifically (!) yet.

If you feel like it might be a match after reading my post, feel free to reach out. So as not to waste any more time without knowing each other, I’ll start with

**a bit about me**

I turned 21 a bit ago and live in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, very close to the Netherlands and Belgium. I'm 198cm tall, athletic, and I'm confident in my looks (Pictures are available right away - just ask). I finished my bachelors a while ago and now I work in public administration.

In my free time, I'm into

* Reading (Mostly classics and fantasy novels)
* Artsy stuff (Writing, making clay figures, taking photos or refurnishing my room like I do at the moment)
* Cooking (Still suck at handling slabs of meat, but I´m getting there)
* Gaming (would love to play some co-op together)
* Binge-watching movies and shows
* Fitness (mostly lifting, jogging and calisthenics)
* Traveling (Next vacation is gonna be next month, yay)
* Self-care (I have a real love for fragrances and taking care of myself in general)

I'm the calm, confident, and dependable type. I'm direct in communication and I keep my plans. In public I'm pretty calm, but in private I'm very affectionate and playful. I really love taking care of the people I love through food, touch, words, and preparing surprises.

**What I hope we'll build**

I hope we can build something with a genuine friendship and genuine care as the foundation, without rushing anything. I'm looking for monogamy, adult communication, equal effort, consistency and intentionality right from the start. When we like each other, we act like it.

I believe something special happens in a romantic partnership, where it becomes the primary place for that deep, vulnerable connection. I'm looking to build that kind of close, singular bond with my person.

As for what I bring to the table for that:

* Stability and dependability
* Emotional health and availability (I protect time for my person)
* Maturity and good, direct communication
* A nurturing side with gentle humor and playful teasing

I value and need those traits in others a lot as well. So what I'm ultimately looking for is deep, mature, mutual devotion. A relationship where we both give to each other because it makes us happy. Not because we need each other to function, but because being together is fulfilling.

**Little dreams about us**

I'm not just looking for a plus-one for my existing plans, I'm looking for someone to make new ones with. My big dream is a partnership that feels like an adventure and a sanctuary in one. There are so many things I want to experience with you, especially when it comes to traveling:

* One of those glass igloo hotels in Lapland (look them up, you won't regret it)
* Touring through Europe together and the same through rural Japan
* And lots of trips together in general, since I travel about 3 times a year and would love for you to accompany me

But for me the foundation to something fullfilling is in the quieter daily moments like cozy weeknights where we recharge, make new experiences together on weekends, and the relaxation of cuddling up in bed together, especially in winter. I want a love that's as intentional in its daily rhythm as it is in its long-term plans.

**Closing Note**

I'm not too experienced with relationships, but I've put a lot of thought into what I want and what I can give. As I said, life has been going really well lately, I feel steady, content and I feel like I have a lot to give. Because of that, I've had the growing feeling that the right person is missing (You!). Like the title implies, I'd prefer to meet someone from NL/BE/DE so meeting up and spending time will be a lot easier, but I'm open to connections from anywhere in the EU as long as you are intentional and upfront.

A quick hello with your age and where you're from is a perfect start when you decide to reach out. To get us talking, tell me what kind of date we'll be doing first: coffee, a museum, or one of your suggestions! (Also, I text a lot less formally in private, but I thought it´d be best if I polished this post up haha)

I'll be honest: I'm selective. I turn down the majority of conversations early because I can tell they aren't leading to the kind of connection I've described above. My hope is that by being clear about what I'm looking for, I attract someone who's looking for the same thing and knows she's it.

To everyone reading this, whether you reach out or not, I'm wishing you the coziest saturday evening and hope you're well, wherever you are :) I'll be looking for your message",1,1770485545.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

""Look, I agree that it’s not right at all for Jax to mistreat people and bully Gangle, but it’s not fair to call him a VILLAIN. We already see this in Episode 5. If he truly didn’t care, why would he be worried about Gangle? Deep down, he was worried because he did EXACTLY what Gangle is doing now: entrusting his own happiness to someone else. At his core, he just doesn't want her to end up like him. That’s why he bullies her: to show that it’s not worth trusting someone only to suffer if that person leaves (NOT that he is right; that is 100% wrong). Furthermore, if he didn’t care, why would he be hurt by what Ragatha said?

Despite what he said in Episode 6, we know it’s a lie. He didn’t realize it, but he was desperate for a friend, and we saw how happy he was throughout Episode 6 and when she hugged him. You could see the happiness in his smile and his eyes when that happened, just as we saw how he REGRETTED pushing Pomni and saying those things to her. He was on the verge of tears in the theater. Especially now in Episode 7, we saw how much he SUFFERS for having lost his friends, as much as he hides it. He only pushes people away because he doesn’t want to LOSE them like he lost Ribbit. So much so that he fell into DEPRESSION and would have actually abstracted if Pomni hadn't knocked on the door (thank you so much, Pompom; I don't know what I’d do without him).

Don’t believe me? What about this commercial?:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoH4RcdNUoU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoH4RcdNUoU) .I think it’s VERY clear what he was going to say at the end (AGAIN, not agreeing with him putting pepper in the guy's coffee and KIDNAPPING his family). Not to mention we found out that just as he has traumas in the circus, he also has traumas in REAL LIFE. Who wouldn't be traumatized after a car accident at age 22?!

Who is the true villain: the one who acts like an idiot to protect himself from more pain and suffering, or those who HATE him for it?

1qyjqf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1qyjqf7/wedding_invite_but_were_not_really_friends/,Wedding Invite… but we’re not really friends,"I am looking for advice. I have a former coworker who invited me to his wedding in two years. He’s getting married to a former high-school classmate of mine, but I haven’t kept in touch with her, so she hasn’t invited me herself.

The thing is, we’re not really friends. He doesn’t reach out, and when I suggested grabbing coffee sometime and maybe going out as couples (him and his fiancée, me and my boyfriend), he said they were busy. I didn’t push it after that and he never asked.

So now I’m wondering — would it be a bit weird to go to his wedding, considering the situation? In my country, there’s usually an expectation to give quite a lot of money at weddings — we don’t really do gifts, just money.

To be fair, he did help me once by referring me for a job, and I ended up getting hired.

Would you go to his wedding?

they did a endoscopy and it came back clear so my doctor again ruled out gastritis. however now i’m still suffering with nausea (though omeprazole and a low acid diet helps control it) and doc says that isn’t really typical for dyspepsia/gerd. so again i’m like is it gastritis ???

with the omeprazole helping for the most part i’ve been eating a lot more normally again (but still no spice or coffee) and last night i got terrible nausea again. i’m switching to pantoprazole now and hoping that will help but i’m feeling very deflated and desperate. it’s frustrating that my doctor doesn’t really seem to want to figure out what’s going on beyond prescribing me more PPI. my question is could i still have gastritis and what would this mean?

i understand that either of these are stress induced but im truly not very stressed at the moment. doctor suggested SSRI as next step for nausea, any experience?

would really appreciate some input

This is my attempt at sending a letter in a bottle, trusting that maybe it finds its way to the right shore.

I am, at my core, an introvert. I value stillness, long stretches of quiet, and the comfort of downtime at home. Yet paradoxically, I come alive when I step outside my familiar world... traveling somewhere new, standing among strangers, or losing myself in the energy of a live show. Music has always been my happy place. There’s something about the shared sound and collective emotion that reminds me how connected we really are in that moment.

I’m drawn to conversation, not just the deep, philosophical kind, but the everyday exchanges that slowly build familiarity and trust. I believe connection grows through consistency and effort. If there’s no energy invested, there’s no foundation to build on. What I’m searching for is that rare “needle in the haystack”, a genuine friendship rooted in openness, honesty, and mutual presence.

Think about the people in your life who truly show up for you, the ones who would drop everything if you needed them. Most of us can count those people on one hand, maybe fewer. I want to find someone who belongs on that small, meaningful list, and I hope to be that kind of person in return.

I value unfiltered conversation, the kind where masks fall away and stories are shared without hesitation. Tell me where you’ve been, what shaped you, what still excites you, and what keeps you up at night. Let me listen. Maybe somewhere in that exchange, we discover a spark that grows into something bigger than either of us expected.

I may be older, but I carry a strong sense of curiosity and a willingness to experience life for the first time again and again. There are still adventures waiting for me... new cities, new songs, new moments, and I approach them with the heart of someone who refuses to stop discovering.

I’ve reached out here once before without finding the connection I was hoping for, so I am going to try one more time. 

Location matters less than connection. Being near the CST time zone might be ideal, but genuine connection has no borders or limits.

What matters to me is simple and grounded: family, dogs (and animals in general), music, coffee that keeps the day moving, travel that expands perspective, good food, and a willingness to try almost anything at least once. Life feels richer when shared with someone who approaches it with curiosity and openness.

If you’ve read this far and felt something resonate, even quietly, maybe this message was meant for you. Perhaps you’re also searching for something real in a space often filled with noise.

Once I´m sure about you, I´ll be all-in about my love and I will keep choosing you and making you happy every day.

Finding that someone is pretty hard though, I´ve been searching for a while and I still didn´t get a DM from you (!) yet.

If you feel like it might be a match after having read my post, feel free to reach out. So as to not waste any more time without knowing each other, I´ll start with

**a bit about me**

I turned 21 a bit ago and live in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, very close to the Netherlands and Belgium. I'm 198cm tall, athletic, and I'm confident in my looks (Pictures are available right away - just ask). I finished my bachelors a while ago and now I work in public administration.

In my free time, I'm into

* Reading (Mostly classics and fantasy novels)
* Artsy stuff (Writing, making clay figures, taking photos or refurnishing my room like I do at the moment)
* Cooking (Still suck at handling slabs of meat, but I´m getting there)
* Gaming (would love to play some co-op together)
* Binge-watching movies and shows
* Fitness (mostly lifting, jogging and calisthenics)
* Traveling (Next vacation is gonna be next month, yay)
* Self-care (I have a real love for fragrances and taking care of myself in general)

I'm the calm, confident, and dependable type. I'm direct in communication and I keep my plans. In public I'm pretty calm, but in private I'm very affectionate and playful. I really love taking care of the people I love through food, touch, words, and preparing surprises.

**What I hope we'll build**

I hope we can build something with a genuine friendship and genuine care as the foundation, without rushing anything. I'm looking for monogamy, adult communication, equal effort, consistency and intentionality right from the start. When we like each other, we act like it.

I believe something special happens in a romantic partnership, where it becomes the primary place for that deep, vulnerable connection. I'm looking to build that kind of close, singular bond with my person.

As for what I bring to the table for that:

* Stability and dependability
* Emotional health and availability (I protect time for my person)
* Maturity and good, direct communication
* A nurturing side with gentle humor and playful teasing

I value and need those traits in others a lot as well. So what I'm ultimately looking for is deep, mature, mutual devotion. A relationship where we both give to each other because it makes us happy. Not because we need each other to function, but because being together is fulfilling.

**Little dreams about us**

I'm not just looking for a plus-one for my existing plans, I'm looking for someone to make new ones with. My big dream is a partnership that feels like an adventure and a sanctuary in one. There are so many things I want to experience with you, especially when it comes to traveling:

* One of those glass igloo hotels in Lapland (look them up, you won't regret it)
* Touring through Europe together and the same through rural Japan
* And lots of trips together in general, since I travel about 3 times a year and would love for you to accompany me

But for me the foundation to something fullfilling is in the quieter daily moments like cozy weeknights where we recharge, make new experiences together on weekends, and the relaxation of cuddling up in bed together, especially in winter. I want a love that's as intentional in its daily rhythm as it is in its long-term plans.

**Closing Note**

I'm not too experienced with relationships, but I've put a lot of thought into what I want and what I can give. As I said, life has been going really well lately, I feel steady, content and I feel like I have a lot to give. Because of that, I've had the growing feeling that the right person is missing (You!). Like the title implies, I'd prefer to meet someone from NL/BE/DE so meeting up and spending time will be a lot easier, but I'm open to connections from anywhere in the EU as long as you are intentional and upfront.

A quick hello with your age and where you're from is a perfect start when you decide to reach out. To get us talking, tell me what kind of date we'll be doing first: coffee, a museum, or one of your suggestions! (Also, I text a lot less formally in private, but I thought it´d be best if I polished this post up haha)

I'll be honest: I'm selective. I turn down the majority of conversations early because I can tell they aren't leading to the kind of connection I've described above. My hope is that by being clear about what I'm looking for, I attract someone who's looking for the same thing and knows she's it.

This is the first time I open the Gaggia up (a part for OPV).
I am not technical. However I managed it.
Took me almost 5 hours. I made 2 annoying mistakes. 
1) I left a grommet that needed to be put when screwing the probe (probably would work without but I could not help myself)... Which meant I had to undo the boiler etc... pain! Note that in the e24 I undid the boiler as well as removed the steam wand to get space to put the probe in. I wonder if you get the space without having to undo the pump assembly (which is some extra faff).
2) I read about threading the cables... So I put them through the case hole. I read the section on threading through the box and it sorta of gave the option of thread it later... Anyway. I was eager started to do all the cabling and at the end, I realized I needed to disconnect all the wires from the PID to put through the box. Honestly they should put a big box stating to thread before wiring.

It is an ok job, fiddly at times (stupid things like screwing the 2 little boxes on the case with the little bolt, position of the steam ssr (had to undo it as it hit the funnel... The realized there was a plastic thing on it)

I know the Wizards are visiting here, but they’re also fresh off a road victory over the usually formidable Detroit Pistons.

1qyjlce,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SoftwareEven809/comments/1qyjlce/a_stable_life/,A stable life,"To build a stable life, begin by establishing a daily routine that calms your nervous system. Physical health nurtures mental well-being; when you cultivate both, stability naturally follows.

Here is a simple way to start:

1. **Ground Your Day:** Begin with a consistent morning routine—even 10 minutes of quiet breathing, gentle stretching, or mindful coffee can signal safety to your nervous system.
2. **Move Your Body:** Regular physical activity—whether walking, yoga, or exercise—regulates energy, reduces stress, and strengthens physical health.
3. **Nourish & Rest:** Prioritize balanced nutrition and consistent sleep. These are the raw materials for a resilient body and a calm mind.
4. **Evening Wind-Down:** Create a peaceful evening ritual, like reading or reflecting, to help your mind and body transition into rest.

When your body feels strong and your mind feels clear, you build a stable foundation from which to meet life’s challenges. Stability grows from these daily, consistent choices.

  
想要构筑安稳的生活，可以从建立一个能安抚神经的日常习惯开始。身体健康滋养心理健康，当两者兼备，安稳自会来临。

可以从以下简单的步骤着手：

1. **稳定日常：** 从规律的早晨习惯开始——即使是10分钟的静心呼吸、温和拉伸或专注地喝一杯咖啡，都能向你的神经系统传递安稳的信号。
2. **活动身体：** 规律的肢体活动，无论是散步、瑜伽还是锻炼，都能调节能量、减轻压力、增强体魄。
3. **滋养与休息：** 优先考虑均衡的营养和稳定的睡眠。这是打造强韧身体与平和心境的原材料。
4. **舒缓入夜：** 建立一个平静的晚间仪式，例如阅读或静思，帮助身心过渡到休息状态。

当你的身体感到强健，思维变得清晰，你便打下了一个稳固的基础，足以应对生活的种种挑战。安稳，正源于这些日复一日、持之以恒的选择。",1,1770484912.0,u_SoftwareEven809,0,1.0,False

1qyjk59,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1qyjk59/how_to_actually_become_the_husband_your_partner/,How to ACTUALLY Become the Husband Your Partner Brags About: Science-Based Strategies That Go Way Beyond Bare Minimum,"Okay so this started when I was scrolling through relationship subs at 2am (as one does when they can't sleep) and noticed a pattern. Like every third post was someone venting about their mediocre husband who ""helps out sometimes"" or ""means well"" but basically operates at the emotional intelligence level of a golden retriever.



And here's what got me: most of these guys probably think they're doing fine. They're not cheating, they have a job, they remember anniversaries (sometimes). But that's literally the floor, not the ceiling. I went down this massive rabbit hole of research, books, podcasts, therapy content, anything I could find about what actually makes marriages thrive vs just survive. Because I realized there's almost no good content out there for men who want to be genuinely exceptional partners, not just ""good enough.""



The thing is, we're kind of set up to fail at this. Society doesn't really teach men emotional skills or relational intelligence. We learn how to compete, how to provide, how to fix things. But nobody teaches us how to be truly present with another human or how to build intimacy that lasts decades. It's not our fault we weren't taught this stuff, but it IS our responsibility to learn it now.



Here's what actually works, backed by research and expert advice I've compiled:



\*\*1. understand that emotional labor is real labor\*\*



Read ""[Fair Play](https://karagoldin.com/podcasts/eve-rodsky/)"" by Eve Rodgers (it's a game changer, won a ton of awards). Rodgers is an organizational management expert who created this whole system for dividing household responsibilities. The book breaks down all the invisible work that keeps a household running, like remembering doctor appointments, planning meals, tracking when kids need new shoes, managing social calendars.



Most of this falls on women by default and it's EXHAUSTING. Rodgers uses this card system to make it all visible and dividable. Honestly this book will make you realize how much mental load your partner is probably carrying that you don't even see. It's uncomfortably eye opening but necessary.



The key insight: don't just ""help"" with tasks she assigns you. That makes her the manager and you the employee. Instead, own entire categories of responsibility from conception to execution. She shouldn't have to ask you to do things or remind you. That's still making it her problem.



\*\*2. learn her actual love language (then use it consistently)\*\*



Everyone knows about love languages from Gary Chapman's book, but most people just take the quiz once and forget about it. The real work is observing what makes your partner feel most loved and doing those things REGULARLY, not just on special occasions.



If her love language is quality time, sitting next to her while scrolling your phone doesn't count. Put the phone away. Make eye contact. Ask questions that go deeper than ""how was your day.""



Dr. John Gottman's research (he's studied thousands of couples for 40+ years) shows that happy marriages have a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions. You need five deposits in the emotional bank account for every withdrawal. Most mediocre husbands are operating at like 1:1 at best.



\*\*3. get comfortable with difficult conversations\*\*



Downloaded this app called Paired (it's like Duolingo but for relationships). Every day it gives you questions to discuss with your partner, some light, some heavy. Things like ""what's one way I could better support you right now"" or ""what's something you're afraid to tell me.""



These conversations are awkward at first but they prevent the slow drift that kills most marriages. Esther Perel talks about this in her podcast ""Where Should We Begin"" (insanely good listen btw). She says most relationships don't end because of one big thing, they end because of accumulated small distances that never get addressed.



The skill here is learning to stay present when things get uncomfortable instead of shutting down, getting defensive, or trying to immediately fix everything. Sometimes she just needs you to listen and validate her feelings without jumping to solutions.



\*\*4. prioritize her pleasure in every sense\*\*



Read ""Come As You Are"" by Emily Nagoski. It's technically about female sexuality but it's really about understanding how desire works differently for different people. Nagoski has a PhD in health behavior and this book won like every award in the sex education space.



The biggest takeaway: responsive desire is totally normal and common, especially for women. Meaning desire doesn't just appear spontaneously, it responds to context and stimulation. So creating the right context (emotional safety, low stress, feeling desired and appreciated) matters MORE than technique or spontaneity.



But this applies beyond just sex. Prioritize her pleasure in general. Does she love that specific coffee but never buys it for herself? Get it. Does she mention wanting to try that new restaurant? Make a reservation. Is she stressed about something? Take things off her plate without being asked.



\*\*5. stay curious about who she's becoming\*\*



People change. The person you married five years ago isn't the same person today and that's actually beautiful if you're both growing. But you have to stay curious about those changes instead of assuming you know everything about her.



The Gottman Institute has this concept called ""love maps"" which is basically detailed knowledge about your partner's inner world. Their dreams, stresses, joys, fears. You should be updating this constantly.



If you want to go deeper on relationship psychology without spending hours reading dense books, there's a smart learning app that's been genuinely helpful. It pulls from relationship research, therapy frameworks, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content based on exactly what you're working on.



You could type in something like ""I'm a guy who struggles with emotional availability and I want to become a better husband,"" and it'll build you a custom learning plan from sources like Gottman's research, Esther Perel's work, attachment theory, and more. You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples, and choose different voice styles (the deeper, conversational voices work well for this stuff).



The adaptive plan feature is clutch because it evolves based on what you're actually struggling with, not just generic advice. Plus you can pause mid-episode to ask questions or get clarification on concepts. Makes fitting this kind of growth into commutes or gym time way more doable than trying to read multiple therapy books.



Easy practice: ask one question per week that you don't already know the answer to. ""If you could change one thing about your life right now what would it be"" or ""what's something you've been thinking about lately that you haven't told me yet.""



\*\*6. own your own mental health and growth\*\*



Your emotional regulation is YOUR job, not hers. She's your partner, not your therapist or your mom. If you have unresolved trauma, anxiety, depression, anger issues, whatever, get professional help.



I use this app called Headspace for daily meditation (10 minutes, that's it) and it genuinely helps with reactivity and stress management. Therapy is obviously ideal if you can access it.



Read ""No More Mr Nice Guy"" by Robert Glover if you struggle with people pleasing or passive aggressive behavior. It's specifically for men who were taught to suppress their needs and authentic selves, then wonder why their relationships feel hollow. The book is uncomfortable but effective at identifying these patterns.



\*\*7. fight fair and repair quickly\*\*



Conflict is inevitable and actually healthy if handled right. Gottman's research identified ""four horsemen"" that predict divorce: contempt, criticism, defensiveness, stonewalling. Learn to recognize these in yourself and stop them.



When you mess up (and you will), repair quickly. ""I'm sorry"" followed by CHANGED BEHAVIOR. Not excuses, not explanations of why she made you do it, just accountability and different choices next time.



Also learn the difference between apologizing for her feelings vs apologizing for your actions. ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" is not an apology, it's dismissive. Try ""I'm sorry I did X, I can see how that hurt you, I'll do Y differently next time.""



\*\*8. build a life outside the marriage\*\*



This sounds counterintuitive but having your own interests, friendships, and identity makes you a better partner. Codependence isn't intimacy, it's dysfunction.



She needs space to be herself without you. You need the same. Maintain friendships, have hobbies, stay interesting and growing as an individual. Marriages where both people have rich inner and outer lives tend to stay vibrant.



Read ""[Mating in Captivity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27485.Mating_in_Captivity)"" by Esther Perel. It's about maintaining desire in long term relationships and one of her main points is that too much closeness can actually kill attraction. You need some separateness, some mystery, some autonomy.



\*\*9. show up for the boring stuff consistently\*\*



Grand gestures are nice but daily reliability is what builds trust. Do what you say you're going to do. Show up on time. Remember the things she tells you. Follow through on commitments.



This extends to parenting if you have kids. Being an equal parent, not a helper or babysitter. Knowing your kids' schedules, teachers' names, clothing sizes, friend drama, everything.



Honestly just being consistent and trustworthy in small ways builds more security than occasional big romantic gestures ever will.



\*\*10. never stop dating her\*\*



I don't care if you've been married 40 years, keep courting her. Plan things, make effort with your appearance, flirt, show genuine interest, create novelty and fun.



The app Relish has good prompts for this. It's like a relationship coach in your pocket. Sends you challenges like ""plan a date doing something you've never done together"" or ""write her a letter about why you chose her.""



Relationships require active maintenance. You wouldn't buy a plant and never water it then be surprised when it dies. Same principle.



This isn't about being perfect. It's about being intentional and willing to keep learning and growing. The husbands who get bragged about aren't the ones who got it all right from day one, they're the ones who stay committed to becoming better partners every single year.",1,1770484833.0,ModernDatingDoneRight,0,1.0,False

I am currently in the interview process for an Outreach and Events Manager position at a well-known public university in Virginia, and I am not sure how to proceed with the next steps. 

Earlier this week, I completed my 1st round interview for this position via a Zoom panel interview with the entire search committee. I just found out that I have advanced to the 2nd round of interviews, which will be in-person on the campus. This is the email I received from the hiring manager regarding the 2nd interview:

*The campus visit activities will be scheduled over the course of a single day, beginning with coffee at 8:30 and wrapping up around 4. There will be several meetings arranged for you, and you will be asked to present on the topic of “Planning, Promoting, and Executing a Major Global Education Event.” You will have 40-45 minutes for your presentation, as the topic is quite broad. Dedicated Q&A time will follow.*

*As you consider the topic, think about the entire arc of conceptualization, preparation, execution, and follow-up. For instance, what would be a good strategy for connecting with a large number of students from across the university (not just a single college or student group)? What would this event look like? How would you get the word out and attract attendance? What offices and stakeholders would be involved in preparing and executing this event and how might you coordinate and encourage participation? What follow-up could help you convert event attendance into engagement in global education? What measures would you use to assess the effectiveness of the event?*

I am conflicted on how to proceed. To me, this sounds a bit like they are asking for free labor and free ideas, as they mentioned in the 1st interview that they are looking for ways to increase student engagement with their office. I am also concerned because this is only the second round of interviews, and I was not told how many more interview rounds there would be, should I advance to the next step(s). I also know that there are still many applicants in the running, as the hiring manager told me that they have filled an entire week with days like this for applicants. Lastly, I want to mention that this is not a senior level role (the required qualifications were Bachelor’s plus significant comparable experience).

Is this standard practice for a 2nd round interview at this career level? Should I agree to attend and complete a presentation, knowing that I will have to put hours of my time into this project for free?

He told himself this was fine. Most of his better ideas arrived late. Usually inconveniently late.

The prompt wanted conflict. He just wanted sleep. 

\[I guess a second pot of coffee it is\]

He took a deep breath and hit the brew button. Maybe something would come to mind once the timer went off. 

\[Well… I guess that would be a start.\]

\*\*\*\*\*\*

	Mr. Hammons poured himself a cup of coffee and downed it in four scalding gulps. “I just have to make it through the next few hours and I’ll be off for the next week and a half.” 

	He turned to give his wife a kiss but was winded as his three year old ran by at just the wrong height. “Stop running in the house,” Mr. Hammons gasped.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

\[No. That doesn’t feel right maybe he’s  not a family man. Maybe. Just maybe he’s……\]

\*\*\*\*\*\*

	Montrez Hammons was no ordinary 15 year old. No, not at all. He was absolutely, and unquestionably, extraordinary.

	It just so happened to be that today was the day he would find himself hanging from his briefs from the bathroom stall door. You may ask yourself, “Why does this make him absolutely, and unquestionably, extraordinary?” That would be a great question but unfortunately for our young Mr. Hammons that question has not been answered yet.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

\[I don’t like that but parts of it could work. Maybe if I jump ahead a bit. Change his age. Established backstory that is fleshed out in flashbacks. Yeah. That could work.\]

\*\*\*\*\*\*

	Fischer Hammons found himself, once again, caught in the web of an eight legged Invictus spider. A vile, yet clumsy creature created by Dr. Electroid. 

	“Now let’s see who you really are behind that mask, Green Hunter!” Snarled Dr. Electroid.

	I must break free! He can’t know who I really….. m\*!@$\*?!#$\^!

\*\*\*\*\*\*

\[Wait… what? I give up. I’m going to bed.\]. Sleep hung like anchors from his eyelids as he dragged his feet to bed. So tired he didn’t even shut down his computer. So tired he left the word document up. So tired yet the cursor keeps blinking…

\*\*\*\*\*\*

	I must break free! He can’t know who I really….. He can’t know who I am if he doesn’t survive.

	With a great swoosh Dr. Electroid ripped the mask from the Green Hunter’s head. A look of confusion rushed the Doctor’s face at the sight of the upturn smirk of Fischer Hammons. 

	“I must say I am quite surprised to see you. The peasant of Oleverant,” exclaimed Dr. Electroid. “This is a little underwhelming. Anticlimactic and… why are you making that face?”

	“Oh, Doc. I’m no peasant.” I said as the smile grew increasingly wider. “Do you know why they call me the Hunter?”

	With all my strength I burst through the web of the eight legged freak, springing myself from its muddy, brown abdomen. In the same motion I snatched my double edged infinity blade from the breakaway scabbard along my back. I landed just beside Dr. Electroid and with a flourish laid my blade just against his neck.

	“Oh. Don’t look so surprised.” I said sarcastically. “Neither I nor anyone else will be victims of your tyranny. Any last wo……

\[New day. New ideas. I’ll just set the tea kettle on the stove before settling down.\]

He prepped the kettle while wiping the last bit of sleep from his eyes and set two earl grey satchels to the side. At that moment he noticed the laptop screen still glowing from the night before. 

Curious, he turned to the disappointment that was the evenings writing escapade. 

\[Either I was exhausted or something was in that coffee. I don’t remember writing any of this. Not really my style. A little too violent for my taste.\]

He reviewed and revised. Tweaking a little here and a little there. 

	I must break free! He can’t know who I really am. It will destroy the many years I’ve built this secret identity.

	“Wait!” I blurted out in a panic. “Let’s make a deal.” 

At that moment a whistle squealed from the kitchen.

\[That’ll do for the moment. Don’t move until I get back.\]

He sat down slowly trying not to spill his freshly brewed cup of inspiration when….

\[Wait?…\]

He sat there in utter bewilderment for several seconds. It was then the cursor started gliding across the screen.

What is going on?

“Oh hey. I was just correcting this dog water writing you were accomplishing so well.”

What in the actual…. His mouth gaping like he was trying to eat an apple whole.

“ What’s your deal? You may want to close those cheeks before you catch a love interest.”

I.. Umm.. I.. Huh?

“I can see you’re new here so let me introduce myself. I’m Mr. Hammons… Montrez?… Fischer? No. Definitely not a fisher. I can’t even swim.”

That’s not how words work.

“How would you know? You sound like a child stuttering through a monologue of his day. You said a lot but got nowhere.”

That insult brought his temperature to a boil.

You’re one to talk! What? Were you just going extreme violence on Dr. Electroid? Hold up. Did you write… of course you did. That’s just not my style.

“I was going for edgy. May have been a little much but come on. Dr. Electroid? What kind of name is that and what’s with the spider? Just lazy writing.”

A little put out he said I like spiders. Was it really so terrible?

“It was atrocious.”

He contemplated a better scenario.

“You there? Maybe while you’re thinking you could write me a friend to pass the time with.”

 You seem to do just fine blazing your own trails.

“First of all, that one is unnecessary. Second, my life experiences are a tad bit lacking.”

With a small sigh he accepted his fate.

Well maybe we can remedy that. Is there anything you dreamed about doing? Do you dream? Can you even sleep? No! Not time for a rabbit hole.

“You’re telling me. Superheroes are fine and dandy but I would die to be the villain.”

That could work. Look for treasure in the deserts of the Sahara. Something similar to Indiana Jones.

“That’s really great. Just one small thing.”

What’s that?

“I hate it.”

It could really work. What’s wrong with it?

“I don’t like heat. I like Indy. I don’t like sand. It gets in weird places like your underwear or underthespacebar. See?”

Uhhh… ok then. What about a cowboy and Indian story? Adventure! Action! I’ll even add a gun fight scene.

“The outfits are a big plus but horses make me nervous. Also, it’s Native American. I have a reputation to keep. Geez! Somebody get this guy a proofreader before he speaks.”

What have I created?

“A masterpiece hopefully but keep going.”

This is going to be more difficult than I imagined. I just need to think on this longer.

“Yeah. Keep going. You got this little buddy.”

Don’t do that.

“Sorry. Shhhh. I’ll be quiet.”

I just need to ponder. Meditate. Contemplate… Investigate.

“Hmmm. Yes.”

THAT’S IT!

“What’s it? And don’t shout.”

Ok. I have an idea. Just hear me out.

“Shoot fire! He’s got it. Hit me with it pookie bear!”

Don’t call me pookie bear. Just… listen.

	It was late Friday evening \\nb.    . The neon “Private Eye” sign flickered off and on above rustic oak door.

“I don’t smoke but keep going.”

	She stood there for a moment, letting the silence do the talking, then crossed the room like she already owned the ending.

“I like where this is going.”

I know.

	“Detective Hammons? I need your help,” the lady in red said.

	I looked up from underneath the worn edge of my fedora, “Can’t you see we’re closed. Get lost.”

	“Please, detective Hammons. My sister is missing,” she begged.

	“I hate the accent,” I grumbled.

	The lady blinked. “What accent?”

	

	“Don’t worry about it, doll,” I said. “I was talking to him.”

	There was a pause.

What accent?

“You know. That nasal thing. Like everyone’s mildly congested and emotionally unavailable.”

I didn’t write an accent.

“Yeah, but you’re thinking it.”

How do you know what I’m thinking?

“I just do. You’re very predictable.” 

Predictable? PREDICTABLE! 	You’ve sure got some nerve! Nothing about this is predictable. Us having this conversation is just absurd. It doesn’t make any sense.

“It makes perfect sense.”

Oh please explain it then Mr. I know you because you’re predictable.

“It’s like that one episode of looney tunes where Daffy Duck keeps getting erased and redrawn throughout the scene. In the end it was just Bugs Bunny messing with him in the end. Do you remember that episode?”

Not at all.

“EXACTLY! Me either.”

I can’t believe I’m having this conversation. You’re a child.

“No. I’m a figment of your imagination.”

He rubbed his eyes.

That’s not better.

“It’s accurate and it’s working.”

“No! This isn’t working,” the author said.

“I like the way it was going. Just lose the accent.”

“For the last time, I didn’t write an…,” he paused with confusion on his face. “Why am I in quotations marks?”

“There’s a first time for everything. I’m just trying to help. I can go though so your ‘genius’ can glow.”

The author yelled, “GET OUT!”

There was no response.

“Hammons,” he asked into the empty room. “Are you there?”

After the constant back and forth the silence seemed almost too much. What had just happened? There must be something in the tea he thought.

Just at that moment a loud knock at the door startled the author to his feet. 

He slowly walked over and opened the door to see a man standing there with a wide, knowing grin.

“May I help you?” asked the author.

The grinning man pushed on through and walked in like he owned the place.

“Excuse me. What do you think you’re doi-“ the author’s sentence was cut short as the grinning man put his index finger up to the author’s lips.

“Shhh. Don’t you recognize me, pookie bear? After all that time we spent you just forget,” said the man, smiling even bigger. “Remember what I said about keeping your mouth open too wide. Let me help you get that jaw off the floor.”

In shock, the author asked, “But… how?”

“It’s okay, pookie, I know your flabbers have been gasted. Just move over and point me to the computer. It’s Friday and you know this is due by midnight. I got it from here.”

The author just stood amazed and slowly pointed to the desk.

“It’s my story anyway.”",1,1770484490.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1qyje5i,https://i.redd.it/6smwajjav3ig1.jpeg,I’m Done Chasing the Perfect Shot,"Why I Switched from a Traditional Espresso Setup to Outin

After years of using a traditional espresso machine, I’ve decided to make a clean break. Not because I don’t love coffee—quite the opposite—but because I’m tired of the constant switching, tweaking, and endless search for the perfect shot. Dialing in, re-dialing, changing beans, adjusting temperature, pressure, timing… it started to feel less like a morning ritual and more like a second job.

What finally pushed me over the edge was the realization that I don’t actually want variability anymore. I want reliability. I want great coffee without turning every espresso into a small science experiment.

That’s why I’m switching fully to the Outin. It consistently delivers solid, dependable results with minimal effort. No drama, no guesswork, no frustration when a shot goes sideways for reasons that only the coffee gods understand. It just works—and it works every single time.

To be clear: my grinder stays. Good beans and a good grind still matter. But the constant hardware juggling and obsessive fine-tuning? I’m done with that. At this point, simplicity beats theoretical perfection.

Maybe this isn’t the path for hardcore espresso purists. But for me, reliable enjoyment beats chasing an ever-moving target. Coffee should be a pleasure, not a problem to solve every morning.",8,1770484460.0,OutinNano,4,0.83,False

Maintenance insists no one has been on my floor overnight.","The carpet outside my apartment is warm every morning.

Not mildly warm. Not sun-through-the-window warm. It feels like body heat that hasn’t had time to fade yet, like someone got up seconds before I opened the door.

I noticed it because I leave for work early. Same routine every day. Shoes on. Coffee in a travel mug. Lock the door, turn, step forward.

My sock pressed into the carpet and I froze.

Warm.

I lifted my foot and pressed again, slower this time. Same thing. Heat, spread wide, uneven. Like the outline of a person who’d been lying there for hours.

I checked the time. 6:12 a.m.

No one else on my floor leaves that early. Most of the units are empty anyway. The building’s half-occupied and sinking into that quiet neglect phase landlords pretend not to notice.

I stood there longer than I should have, staring at the carpet like it might explain itself.

Then I told myself it was the pipes.

That’s my flaw. I always look for the explanation that lets me keep moving.

I have a practical reason for that. I can’t afford disruption. I moved into this building because it was cheap and close to my job. My contract ends in six months, and if I break the lease early, I lose the deposit I don’t have the savings to replace. I work nights sometimes. Long shifts. Irregular sleep. I need things to stay predictable.

So I stepped over the warm spot and went to work.

The next morning, it was warm again.

Same shape. Same place. Directly in front of my door, centered like whoever lay there knew exactly where my threshold was.

I knelt this time. Put my palm flat against the carpet.

It was warmer in the middle.

Cooler toward the edges.

I checked my door camera history. No alerts. No motion recorded overnight. The camera faces outward. It should have picked something up.

I rewound anyway. Nothing.

That was the first soft red flag I ignored. The absence of anything where there should have been something.

On the third morning, I noticed the fibers were pressed down.

Not flattened like foot traffic. Compressed. Directional. Like weight had been applied slowly, consistently, then released.

I reported it to maintenance that afternoon.

The guy who came up barely looked at the carpet. He pressed it with the toe of his boot and shrugged. Said heat rises. Said old buildings do weird things overnight.

I asked him if anyone had been sleeping in the hallway.

He laughed and said no one’s been on my floor overnight. The stairwell door logs entries. No movement between midnight and morning.

He left without writing anything down.

That night, I dreamed I was lying on the floor.

Not inside my apartment. Outside it. Facing my own door. The carpet felt good against my cheek. The heat wasn’t uncomfortable. It was comforting.

In the dream, I could hear myself breathing on the other side of the door.

When I woke up, my jaw hurt.

Like I’d been clenching it for hours.

The warmth outside my door lasted longer the next morning. It didn’t fade when the sun came up. It didn’t fade when I got home from work, either.

I pressed my ear to the door.

I don’t know what I expected to hear.

There was nothing. Just silence thick enough to feel intentional.

That night, I didn’t sleep much. Around 3 a.m., I heard something shift outside. Not footsteps. More like fabric dragging softly across carpet.

I checked the camera.

Still nothing.

In the morning, the warmth stretched farther down the hallway.

Not wide.

Long.

Like whatever had been there didn’t stay in one place anymore.

Maintenance insists no one has been on my floor overnight.

I believe them.

That’s what scares me.

I started timing how long the warmth lasted.

At first, it faded by noon. Then by late afternoon. Then not at all. By the end of the week, the carpet outside my apartment stayed warm through the night, through my shifts, through everything.

It became part of the floor. Like the building had learned a new default.

I stopped stepping on it. I hugged the wall when I left, pressing myself sideways like the hallway was narrower than it actually was. That lasted until the warmth spread far enough that there was no way around it.

It wasn’t just outside my door anymore.

It ran along the baseboards. Traced the hallway like a body had rolled slowly, inch by inch, testing space.

I checked with my neighbors. The few that still lived on the floor gave me polite looks and careful answers. One said she hadn’t noticed anything. Another said the carpet had always been weird.

No one offered to come look.

That was when I realized something else.

No one ever stood directly in front of my door.

When people talked to me in the hallway, they stopped a few steps short. Close enough to be polite. Far enough that their shoes never touched the warm patch.

I started watching their feet.

They’d shuffle without realizing it. Adjust their stance. Step back half an inch. Always back.

Like instinct.

My sleep got worse. Not because of nightmares. Because I kept waking up convinced I was late for something.

Every time I checked the clock, it was around 3 a.m.

Every time, my phone showed activity on my fitness app.

Steps.

Always the same distance. Always the same slow pace.

Always ending right outside my door.

I tried staying up through it.

I sat on my couch with the lights off and the door in front of me, camera feed open on my phone. The hallway view stayed empty. No shadows. No movement.

At 3:11 a.m., I felt the floor vibrate.

Not a knock. Not footsteps.

Pressure.

Like someone leaning their full weight against the door, careful not to make noise.

The warmth spiked. I could feel it through the wood, through my socks.

I held my breath without meaning to.

The pressure stayed for a long time.

Then it eased.

When I checked the camera again, there was still nothing there.

In the morning, there were marks in the carpet.

Not footprints.

Handprints.

Pressed deep, fingers splayed, like someone had pushed themselves up from the floor and hesitated.

That was the day maintenance stopped answering my emails.

I tried the office. The number rang until it disconnected. I went downstairs in person and found the lobby locked, lights off, a notice taped crookedly to the glass about “temporary restructuring.”

The building felt emptier after that. Not abandoned. Just… selective.

The warmth started responding to me.

If I stood still outside my door, it pooled closer. If I stepped back, it followed. Slowly. Patiently.

Never crossing the threshold.

That detail kept me calm longer than it should have.

It can’t come inside, I told myself.

I don’t know why I believed that.

Last night, I woke up on the floor.

Inside my apartment.

My cheek pressed flat against the carpet, exactly where the warmth would be if I were outside.

The door was inches from my face.

I don’t remember lying down.

My phone was in my hand. The camera app was open.

The screen showed the hallway.

Empty.

But the timestamp kept updating.

And the step counter kept climbing.

This morning, the warmth didn’t stop at my door.

It seeped under it.

Just enough to notice.

Just enough to understand I’m running out of something.

I’m not sure what yet.

But whatever’s out there has been very patient.

And it’s finally close enough to learn the shape of me.

I didn’t go to work after that.

I stood in my kitchen watching the thin line of warmth bleed farther into the apartment, inch by inch, like a tide that didn’t care about walls. It wasn’t fast. It didn’t need to be.

That was the pattern I should have recognized sooner. Nothing about this rushed.

I called building management again. Straight to voicemail. I called the city non-emergency line. They transferred me twice, then suggested I contact the property owner. Same disconnected number. Same dead end.

By noon, the warmth had reached the edge of my living room rug.

It didn’t feel hot anymore. It felt familiar.

I crouched and pressed my palm to it. My hand sank slightly, fibers parting like they remembered me. The heat matched my skin perfectly. Not warmer. Not cooler.

The wrongness of that hit me all at once.

Heat should fade. Bodies cool. Even machines fluctuate.

This didn’t.

I pulled my hand back and noticed something else.

The warmth had a boundary.

A clean one.

It followed the exact outline of where I would normally lie when I collapsed on the floor after work. Same angle. Same bend near the shoulder. Same place where my knees usually pulled in without me thinking about it.

That was when I checked the hallway camera one last time.

The feed was still empty.

But the audio wasn’t.

I turned the volume up slowly, expecting static, maybe HVAC noise.

Instead, I heard breathing.

Shallow. Controlled.

Mine.

Slightly out of sync with the way I was breathing in the kitchen.

I dropped the phone.

The warmth surged forward when it hit the floor, spreading faster now, confident. It reached the couch legs. The coffee table. It brushed my bare foot and I felt a pulse of relief so strong it almost knocked me over.

I understood then what it was taking.

Not my body.

My rest.

Every night I woke up tired. Every morning the carpet was warm. The building wasn’t haunted.

It was fed.

I tried to stay standing. I paced. I leaned against counters. I drank water until I felt sick. The hunger crept in anyway. Not for food. For lying down. For giving in. For letting something else carry the weight for a while.

My phone buzzed.

A notification from the fitness app.

Great job staying active tonight.

I hadn’t moved.

The warmth reached my ankles and stopped.

Waiting.

That was the final lock-in moment. Not fear. Not force.

Permission.

I lay down.

The relief was immediate. Crushing. Perfect.

The warmth wrapped around me, molded to me, and for the first time in weeks, I slept without dreams.

When I woke up, it was evening.

The apartment was quiet. Too quiet.

I stood and nearly fell. My legs felt light, like they weren’t used to carrying me anymore.

I opened the door.

The hallway carpet was cold.

Dead cold.

No imprint. No warmth. No sign of anything ever being there.

Maintenance was in the hall, talking to someone from leasing. They looked surprised to see me.

One of them asked if I’d been home all day.

I said yes.

He nodded slowly and said that made sense.

They’ve been getting complaints, he told me. About a warm spot on the floor. Outside my apartment.

Said people kept feeling like someone had been lying there for hours.

But every time they checked, there was nothing.

That night, I lay in bed and felt the hunger return.

Not mine.

Something else’s.

The carpet inside my apartment is warm now. Always.

And every morning when I wake up rested for the first time in my life, I know exactly where I’ve been all night.

I just don’t remember getting up.

That’s fine.

These recipes are also flour free and can be altered to suit your needs. I’ve outlined the general recipes below but I mostly eye ball ingredients when I’m making these since none of them are pastry or bakery type items. Hope you enjoy and would love to hear if you try any of them or if you have other ideas/ recipes to add! 



If fruit isn’t your thing, then no worries but the rest of this post may not be that interesting for you. 



**Dessert recipes / descriptions below are:**

	1.	Peanut Butter Apple Crisp

	2.	Poached or baked pears

	3.	Fruit parfait

	4.	Fruit juice or smoothie popsicles with optional whipped cream

	5.	Banana “ice cream” and optional French toast to make it more of a brunch thing 



**Honorable mention treats / things I like:**

	6.	Dark chocolate (not a recipe, more like a serving idea)

	7.	Green smoothie



⸻



**1. Peanut Butter Apple Crisp**



Peanut butter “apple crisp.” I say apple crisp in quotes because I’ve never actually made real apple crisp and don’t care to add some of the ingredients I’ve found in other recipes since I’m not convinced they help. Feel free to look up other recipes for the base or topping, but this is what I’ve been doing.



Apple base:

Chop up as many apples as you want and toss them with nutmeg and cinnamon. Some recipes say 6 cups of apples (so about 6 apples?) with 1½ tsp cinnamon and ⅛ tsp nutmeg. Other recipes add flour or cornstarch to the apples to absorb liquid. I’ve made this a bunch with many different types of apples and there’s never been excess liquid when baking apples in my experience, so I have no idea why you’d need that.



Crisp / crumble topping:

This is the recipe I have been using for homemade granola, and I figured why not use it as the crumble topping.



3 cups oats (old fashioned, quick oats, or a mix)

¼ tsp salt

2 tbsp chia seeds (optional)

1 tsp cinnamon

½ cup natural peanut butter

¼ cup melted coconut oil

1 tsp vanilla



Mix everything and bake at 325°F for about 20 minutes. Since there’s no maple syrup or honey, it doesn’t crisp up the same way as regular granola, so I like to bake it a little longer until some of it looks toasted. If you don’t like the taste of coconut oil, you may want to try a milder oil, because there will be at least a hint of coconut flavor. I don’t mind it with apples or as standalone granola with milk.



Line a pan, add the apples, and bake until soft, about 20–45 minutes depending on the apples. Add the granola on top at the end and bake a little longer to warm it up, or just add it cold at the end. You can make the granola a few days ahead or make the apples the day before and combine and warm the day you serve. Very easy recipe.



Whipped cream:

Just whip heavy cream with vanilla to taste and put on top.



If serving this as dessert to people who eat sugar, vanilla ice cream on the side if desired. Could also try the banana ice cream recipe below to go with it. 



⸻



**2. Poached or Baked Pears**



I’ve only baked them, but I’m sure you could poach them instead if you prefer. Use ripe pears, cut them in half, and bake with a coating of butter and a generous sprinkle of cinnamon. You could also add nutmeg if you want.



Serve with crushed walnuts, toasted nuts, plain yogurt mixed with vanilla, or sugar-free whipped cream. You could also serve with vanilla ice cream if making for people who eat sugar also or could try the banana ice cream recipe. 



⸻



**3. Fruit Parfait**



I got this idea from someone who is not sugar free who served this as dessert for Christmas dinner and I’ve changed it to be sugar-free, and it’s gotten good reviews from family. Serve in tall, small glass dishes or dessert cups for best effect.



Use frozen berries or fresh berries of your choice. We’ve been using frozen since the juice is desirable, but you could also lightly blend fresh berries or leave them whole. If you want this to look nice, test it first, because the juice can look weird in some glass dishes.



Put the berries in the bottom of the dish. Use plain yogurt with the highest fat content the store has and mix it with vanilla extract to taste. You can also add orange zest (fresh or store-bought) on top, or leave it out.



Top with whatever you want: granola, sliced almonds, toasted nuts. If serving people who eat sugar, you could add a small biscuit cookie on top.



Other yogurt ideas:

Plain yogurt is very easy to flavor. You can start with vanilla extract as a base for a warmer flavor or add whatever your favorite yogurt flavors are directly. Matcha powder sprinkled on top could be nice if you don’t want a berry-based dessert.



⸻



**4. Smoothie or Fruit Juice Popsicles**



You can juice fruit from scratch, use store-bought fruit juice, or blend whole fruits. You can even leave some fruit chunky. Mango chunks are especially good slightly whole in a popsicle.



Pour into popsicle molds as-is, or make them creamier by adding sugar-free whipped cream. You could pour the fruit mixture in first, then add whipped cream on top (which becomes the bottom in the mold). Full disclosure: I haven’t tried this exact method yet, but I’ve added whipped cream after freezing and then refrozen them, and I think whipped cream should work fine in the molds.



⸻



**5. Banana Ice Cream and French Toast**



I don’t have exact ratios for this one. It’s more like a smoothie that you freeze, so play around.



Frozen banana

Milk

Half an avocado

Protein powder (optional)

Vanilla

Peanut butter



Blend and freeze. Top with nuts of your choice either before freezing or when serving.



I’ve also made this banana ice cream and then made French toast with sugar-free bread. For the batter, use egg, cinnamon, and a little nutmeg. Cook like normal French toast, then instead of syrup, top with the “ice cream”. If serving a group, you can also offer thawed frozen berries, fresh berries, or blended berries as another topping option.



⸻



**6. Dark Chocolate**



99–100% dark chocolate. I like it plain, but it’s also good served with espresso or coffee after a meal (so I’ve been told). If hosting, you could offer less-dark chocolate for others.



⸻



**7. Green Smoothie**



Not really a dessert, but I love it as a morning treat.

Stiff sole, zero flex. Looks clean in pics, hurts by the second block. That star logo? Only cool if you’re not walking far.



Nike Dunk Low Sneakers

Blue Swoosh shifts in sunlight. Tongue slides sideways instantly. Still looks great with black jeans — just don’t plan a hike.



Nike Dunk Low Sneakers

Rope laces stay tied. Bandana fabric stains if you touch anything damp. Reverse Swoosh feels like a hidden win. Love it, but it’s high-maintenance.



Nike Air Jordan 4 Sneakers

Grey leather hides scuffs. Mesh breathes even in humidity. Plastic wings don’t squeak. The only pair I grabbed three days straight.



Nike Air Max 90 Sneakers

Thin sole = every crack punches your heel. Mint green looks fresh, but one raindrop ruins the vibe. Too fragile for real life.



Nike Air Jordan 1

Denim-like upper picks up lint and coffee splashes fast. Midsole yellowed in a week — but weirdly fits the worn-in look. Perfect for lazy days.



KX/KZ Batch Jordan Air Jordan 4

All-white but not “keep-in-box” white. Orange Jumpman is tiny — only real heads notice. Walked 3 miles. Zero pain. Quiet winner.

1qyjaae,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qyjaae/got_dumped_2_months_ago_and_still_miss_her_like/,Got dumped 2 months ago and still miss her like it's day 1,"Hey,

I (40 m) got dumped by my gf (21) 2 months ago. Yeah i know it's a huge age gap first of all. She was the first girlfriend after 10 years of being single.

The relationship started as a good friendship over common hobby of ours. Both are neurospicy (mildly autistic) and we hit off really well every time we met. After half a year of knowing her, i built my courage and asked her for a date and we hit off really well and ended up going steady. Her parents accepted me right away and her mother and grandmother have been contacting me after the breakup that they pray that we would get back together and that I was a really good influence on her. Also her best friend have been contacting me after the breakup and surprisingly bashing my ex about the breakup, the way she handled it and how dumb she is for doing it. I am quite baffled that her parents and grandparents and best friend is taking my side on this and being in contact with me still without me being the starter of conversations. She always dreamed of having a child but not wanting to birth one. I have a son from my previous marriage i divorced from 10 years ago and she was a good step-mom too and had the participation amount she wanted. I was handling most of course. 

This is what her mother and grandmother mean..

She has been drinking heavily since 14 year old and she was drinking super heavily when we met for the first time. After we started to go steady, she managed to ease up the booze and weed to a normal level (a couple of puffs and a few beers on a weekend) and everything was going better by the day.

She was knee deep in quick loans when we met. I helped her out by covering our food so she could pay up them as quickly as possible. I helped her to graduate and get a job. She moved into a better flat. 

After about a year she wanted to break up out of the blue and I was mortified. I just went automatic mode, said ""ok"" and started to help her pack her stuff. I thanked her for the relationship and she left. A day later we got back together and everything went well again... for a while...

She started to drink more, stay up late watching tiktoks with sound on in bed that kept me awake too. I slept around 5 to 6 hours a night and started to be sleep deprived slowly. I told her about it and it always stopped for a while but came back. The drinking started to spread to the weekdays and in the end she was drinking 4 days a week more or less. Coming home 1am shitfaced to bake a pizza in the oven while I and my son were sleeping in the next room (or rather woke up to the noise) etc. My alcohol consumption also went up that I would get smashed on the kid free weekends with her. When my kid was around, zero alcohol for me. She drank at those times too.

After half a year from that she broke up with me again and came back the next day again.

It all goes well again for a while until the drinking starts again. Half a year passes again and we had a big fight, both drunk. I complained about her erratic use of her money and that i'm starting to have financial troubles too for paying for most of the stuff while she spontaneously buys random things or drinks her money. I broke up with her for the first time. The next day I was feeling remorse of doing it and contacted her after 2 days. We talked about everything, our issues personally and in the relationship. We got back together again and agreed to take couple counceling to help solve the issues so we could solve them with help. Next week went beautifully and she was browsing a new place for us to live together.

After that week she calls me up, wants to break up again and this time it really hit me deep. I cried at the phone and just hung up. We traded the rest of our stuff and returned keys to each other.

She got into dating a new guy just 2 days after the breakup and they are still dating after 2 months but not making it official yet. Now she has sobered up for the new guy. I got blocked from every social media with no reason.

After all this I still miss her and few days ago i called her up and told her that I still have feelings for her and asked if she sees us ever getting back together. The answer was a prolonged ""nnnnooo"" and that she is interested in an other man. I thanked for the conversation, said that if she ever changes her mind, my door is open and wished her well.

I have lost 14kg of weight after the breakup with strict diet and gym, have quit alcohol totally too. I've made the changes mostly for myself but there's also a small hint of ""maybe she will notice"". I have been warm and kind to her after the breakup with no fighting or begging or anything negative. We still see each other in the mutual hobby of ours but nothing more. No texting or other contact.

I'm still pondering asking her for a coffee and try to get back together real slow and not ask it straight up if I hear her rebound thing going sour.

Logically I feel that she is doing the same thing with the new guy as with me - brain flooding up with neurochemicals from the new thing and cutting down booze and when it wears off, booze comes back.

My heart is saying that I just was not enough and now she is doing it for real this time.

I feel I messed up short term possibilities with coming clean with my feelings even if she breaks up with the new guy and maybe even made the new thing stronger with the call since she had to reiterate the breaking up and now she can focus more on the new thing as I'm not a question mark anymore with my feelings. And I really cannot contact her again ever with that kind of confession.

Can anyone give any more hints on getting her back than ""focus on yourself"" as I'm doing it already ?

I have some guesses, but what are they doing up there?…","Local DJ here, I play a handful of gigs annually. I saw Odd Mob last night. He is one of my fav DJs, and I love his mixes, but watching his hands last night I had trouble seeing exactly how he was cuing songs and mixing them in.  My observations are:

\- it didn’t look like he was ever digging for songs w the jog wheel. I’m assuming this means he has a set playlist and he is mostly using the skip button to cue the next song.   This seems straight forward but I usually abandon my playlist, at least the exact order anyway, to match the mood or to mix into the previous DJs song.

\- I didn’t see him using the levels much, mostly just adjusting the EQs. I think this may mean he has his song levels pre-mixed so you and just throw them in on beat and not worry about the volume being off?

\- I couldn’t tell if he was using 2 decks or 4 but to me it sounds like he’s using 4 with one track playing a common base line to mix a few different songs into to maintain a common theme.

Do yall think this is a fair assessment? What else am I missing? Does anyone know of a set on YouTube with Odd Mob, Fred Again, 4 Tet, Black Coffee, Solomun, or others respectable dj where you can see the decks and mixing technique?",11,1770484047.0,Beatmatch,21,0.87,False

1qyj66g,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/1qyj66g/my_theory_on_the_show_as_a_whole_spoilers_for_the/,My theory on the show as a whole. (Spoilers for the entire series),"The Bugsy Mogues Theory

A symbolic / psychological reading of Mr. Robot

(Spoilers for the full series)

Note: This is a theory about the show’s structure and symbolism — not a statement about personal mental health. Sharing to honor the show’s depth, not to claim a definitive answer.

1. Core Premise

Mr. Robot is structured around dissociation — not as a twist, but as architecture.

Corporations, organizations, and pop-culture films function as symbolic stand-ins for internal psychological systems:

\* E Corp → executive function / top-down control

\* AllSafe → baseline regulation and containment

\* fsociety → fight / flight / freeze / fawn responses replacing regulation under threat

\* White Rose / Dark Army → obsession with control, inevitability, and bypassing integration

The show isn’t hiding this — it’s building everything out of it.

2. Ron’s Coffee: The Off-Camera Trigger That Changes Everything

One of the most pivotal events happens off camera.

At Ron’s Coffee (S1E1), Elliot discovers a hidden child exploitation network.

\* It’s not clear which day this happens, because he shows up with files already printed.

\* This suggests he may have returned after researching the network, rather than discovering it and acting immediately.

Psychological Consequences

\* Elliot’s existing coping system is overloaded

\* Mr. Robot reactivates, stepping in to protect

\* The Mastermind is born, a new, task-focused alter ready to act

Dissociation pattern: protector exists → overload → creation of a new, action-oriented part.

All subsequent events — fsociety, the hack, the revolution narrative — flow downstream from this off-camera trigger.

The Mastermind believes he’s acting independently, but he’s executing a preexisting plan structured by Mr. Robot.

3. Films as Internal Architecture (Not References)

Movies are templates for constructed inner worlds — containers for alters and emotional processing:

\* Provide rules, roles, and moral logic

\* Stabilize fragmented experiences

\* Offer symbolic cohesion

🧠 Fight Club → Mr. Robot’s Original Plan (Unknown to the Mastermind)

Episodes: S1E1–S1E9 (reframed by S4E13)

\* Mr. Robot mirrors Tyler Durden

\* Revolution through destruction

\* Freedom through collapse

Crucially:

The Mastermind is born inside this plan without realizing it.

🔒 American History X → Jail & Leon (Containment World)

Episodes: S2E6–S2E9

Jail functions as a controlled inner world:

\* rigid rules

\* identity stripping

\* survival logic

Leon mirrors the character “Lamont” in American History X. In that film, Lamont protects the main character throughout his time incarcerated without his knowledge. The protagonist only learns later that he only survived prison because of Lamont’s protection. 

\* stabilizes Elliot

\* grounds him through humor and references

\* guides him safely through violence

The relationship mirrors main character + protective friend from the film: containment and trust, not just aesthetic.

⏳ Back to the Future → White Rose

Episodes: S3–S4

White Rose embodies dissociation’s fantasy:

If I can change the past, I don’t have to integrate it.

She refuses linear causality, externalizes healing, and substitutes a machine for memory.

🩸 Pulp Fiction → Emotional Truth Leaks

Lines like:

“I’m pretty fucking far from okay.”

act as raw emotional breadcrumbs — truth escaping the protective narrative. Nonlinear and fragmented, they mirror dissociative experience.

4. Vera as a Forced Integration Figure

Vera is not a traditional villain.

He is a forced integration event.

Key Quote (S4E7):

“You ain’t never googled your name? That shit’s important, bro.”

\* Identity that isn’t defined can be controlled

\* Dissociation thrives on avoidance

\* Vera collapses narrative comfort and forces recognition

Unlike Mr. Robot (who protects through separation), Vera forces integration — brutally, but effectively.

5. Names as Psychological Metadata

The show repeatedly signals that names matter.

Within this theory:

\* names encode function before biography

\* they act as compressed psychological data

\* they reveal role, not personality

Examples:

\* Mr. Robot → function

\* fsociety → response pattern

\* White Rose → beauty + decay + time

\* Vera → truth / forced self-recognition

The show tells you outright: look at the names.

6. Why This Interpretation Fits

\* Explains coherence despite narrative chaos

\* Explains why clarity often follows confusion

\* Explains why the ending prioritizes recognition over revolution

These structures are architecture for survival, not escapism.

Recognizing them frees cognitive bandwidth.

I’ll update and respond as I’m able.

I’m close to buying my first espresso machine, the Breville Bambino Plus, and read that the grinder is very important. That is why I chose hand grinders because you get a lot of bang for buck.

After some research I narrowed it down to these grinders:

* 1zpresso K Max
* 1zpresso J Max
* 1zpresso J Ultra
* Kingrinder K4
* Kingrinder K6

I'll use it 90% of the time for espresso but i also have an aeropress that I'd like to use. (Especially when travelling).

I only drink dark and medium roast coffees and want to make milk based drinks as well.

I’ve seen some videos from Lance Hendricks and wanted to ask if any of you could share some advice or real world experience using these hand grinders. I really need help choosing between these different grinders. I want something that can grow with my hobby so i can use it for a longer period of time without having to upgrade it.

If I missed a grinder please let me know which one and why, and of course, if there is a better espresso machine than the Bambino Plus, lemme know, i'm always interested to hear why other options could be better.

His phone lay on the kitchen counter when the screen lit up.

iMessage. From: Mark. ""I miss your taste."" 

The world stopped. Mark was my brother—my very heterosexual brother—and he didn’t want to taste my husband.

I unlocked the phone.

There were two contacts. Mark H.—my brother. And Mark. No photos. No last names.

I opened the second conversation.

Yesterday, 10:45 PM

Liam: This house feels so stuffy tonight. I just want to go back to my hotel room.

Mark: Don't. You'll make me cry. My bed feels so empty.

Liam: Soon. I promise.

Today, 9:30 AM

Mark: Does she suspect anything?

Liam: No. I spun it. She bought it. She always does.

Mark: You're bad.

Liam: Only for you.

My knees nearly gave out as I gripped the counter.

That wasn’t Mark.

It was Sophia.

He had saved her number under my brother's name. 

I closed my eyes as a silent tear slid down my face.

The trust wasn’t just broken.

It was pulverized.

We moved around the kitchen with a synchronized efficiency, brushing against each other unnecessarily as we prepped for the barbecue. A hand on the small of a back here, a lingering glance there. We were radioactive with the memory of what we'd done in that cabin.

""Burger patties are prepped,"" Liam announced, wiping his hands on a towel. He was wearing his 'Grill Master' apron—a gag gift from the kids—and looking devastatingly wholesome. ""How are we on sides?""

""Potato salad is done. Corn is shucked. I just need to chop the watermelon,"" I said, slicing through the green rind with a satisfying crunch.

""You're a machine, Elena."" He leaned in, bussing my temple, his voice dropping an octave. ""And you look incredible in those shorts.""

I swatted him away with a smile. ""Stop it. Guests will be here in ten minutes. Go fire up the grill.""

""Yes, ma'am.""

He retreated to the backyard, whistling. I watched him go, feeling that warm, golden anchor of safety settle deep in my gut. This was the life I had fought for. The sun was shining, the kids were running through the sprinklers in the front yard, and my husband was happy.

The doorbell rang at exactly 1:00 PM.

I wiped my hands and headed for the door. I knew it was Mark. My younger brother was punctuality personified—a trait he had developed to compensate for the fact that the rest of his life was usually a chaotic mess of failed startups and short-lived relationships.

I loved Mark fiercely. He was the only one who knew the full extent of what Liam and I had gone through years ago, and he had been the hardest to win over during the reconciliation. The fact that he and Liam were close friends again was one of my biggest victories.

""Coming!"" I called out.

I swung the door open, a smile ready on my lips.

""Hey, sis!"" Mark grinned, holding a six-pack of craft beer. He looked good—tan, happy, his curly hair tamed for once.

But I barely registered him. My eyes went immediately to the woman standing slightly behind him, tucked into his shadow like she was shy.

""Elena,"" Mark said, stepping aside and pulling the woman forward gently by her hand. ""This is Sophia.""

The first thing I noticed was how young she was.

She couldn't have been more than twenty-four. She had that specific kind of freshness that you don't realize you've lost until you see it on someone else—skin that didn't need foundation, eyes that were wide and clear, a posture that held no tension. She was wearing a simple floral sundress that tied at the shoulders, and her hair was a long, tumbling cascade of honey-blonde waves.

My stomach gave a tiny, involuntary twitch. Trauma brain.

It was an automatic scan. Threat assessment. In the bad years, every woman was a potential enemy. I assessed them for danger signals: Were they flirtatious? Were they too confident? Did they look at Liam like he was a meal?

I looked at Sophia. She wasn't looking at the house, or at me, with calculation. She looked nervous.

""Hi, Mrs. Vance,"" she said, her voice soft and melodic. She extended a hand. ""It is so nice to finally meet you. Mark talks about you constantly.""

I took her hand. Her grip was warm, firm but gentle.

""Please, call me Elena,"" I said, my smile widening, genuine this time. ""Mrs. Vance is my mother-in-law. Come in, come in. Don't stand on the porch.""

As they stepped into the foyer, the tension in my shoulders evaporated. She didn't have the vibe. You know the one—the shark-like energy of a woman on the prowl. Sophia felt... soft. Harmless.

""I love your home,"" Sophia said, looking around the living room with wide eyes. ""It's so... peaceful. Mark said you did the interior design yourself?""

""I did,"" I said, pride warming my chest. ""It's a work in progress.""

""It's beautiful. You have amazing taste.""

""She's sucking up,"" Mark teased, wrapping an arm around Sophia's waist. But he looked at her with an adoration I hadn't seen in him in years. He looked smitten.

""I am not!"" Sophia laughed, swatting his chest lightly. ""I'm being honest.""

We walked through the house to the backyard sliding doors.

""Liam's out back battling the charcoal,"" I said. ""Go rescue him, Mark.""

As we stepped onto the patio, the heat of the afternoon sun hit us, smelling of cut grass and lighter fluid. Liam looked up from the grill, squinting against the smoke.

""There he is!"" Liam called out, grinning. He set down the tongs and wiped his hands. ""Mark, you're late. I almost drank your beer.""

""I'm right on time, you alcoholic,"" Mark shot back, walking over to bro-hug him.

Liam clapped Mark on the back, then turned his attention to Sophia.

I watched closely. It was a habit I couldn't break. I watched Liam's eyes.

He smiled—a polite, welcoming, ""dad"" smile.

""And you must be Sophia,"" Liam said. He didn't step too close. He didn't look her up and down. He kept his distance, respectful of Mark, respectful of me. ""I've heard a lot about you.""

""Hi, Liam,"" she said, offering a small wave rather than a hug. ""Nice to meet you.""

""Beer's in the cooler, wine is on the table,"" Liam said, turning back to his burgers almost immediately. ""Make yourselves at home.""

I exhaled.

No spark. No lingering gaze. Just a man meeting his brother-in-law's new girlfriend.

""Can I help with anything?"" Sophia asked, turning to me. ""I'm useless at the grill, but I can chop, carry, or wrangle children.""

""Oh, you don't have to work,"" I said. ""You're a guest.""

""I insist,"" she said, her blue eyes earnest. ""I hate standing around. Please, put me to use.""

""Well,"" I hesitated. ""The watermelon needs to be cubed.""

""On it.""

We went back into the kitchen, leaving the men by the grill. For the next twenty minutes, we stood side-by-side at the island. It was surprisingly easy. Usually, making conversation with a twenty-something felt like bridging a generational divide, but Sophia was an old soul. She asked about the kids, about my job, about how long Liam and I had been married.

""Twelve years,"" I told her, sliding chopped melon into a bowl.

""Wow,"" she breathed. ""That's... that's incredible. You guys still look like newlyweds.""

I laughed. ""We have our days. But yeah. We're in a good place.""

""Mark says you guys are the 'gold standard,'"" she said quietly, focusing on the cutting board. ""He really looks up to Liam. He says Liam is the kind of man who takes care of things.""

""He is,"" I agreed. ""He's a good man.""

""It's rare,"" she said, a shadow of something sad crossing her face, gone as quickly as it appeared. ""To find loyal men.""

""You just have to find the right one,"" I said gently. ""Mark is a good guy, Sophia. He's got a heart of gold.""

She smiled, brightening again. ""I know. I really like him.""

By the time we went back outside, I had decided: I liked her. I really liked her. She was sweet, unpretentious, and she clearly made my brother happy.

The afternoon blurred into a golden haze of domestic perfection. We ate burgers, drank wine, and laughed until our cheeks hurt.

The real clincher, though, was the kids.

My children, Leo (8) and Mia (5), were usually shy with strangers. But within an hour, Sophia was sitting cross-legged on the grass, letting Mia weave dandelions into her long blonde hair. She didn't care about grass stains on her dress. She was laughing, holding still while Mia tugged a little too hard.

""She's great with them,"" Liam said, coming up beside me where I stood on the deck, nursing a glass of Chardonnay.

""She really is,"" I said, leaning my head on his shoulder. ""Mark finally picked a winner.""

""She seems... young,"" Liam noted, his voice neutral. He took a sip of his beer, his eyes on the group in the grass. ""A little naive.""

""She's twenty-four, Liam. We were all naive at twenty-four.""

""I guess,"" he shrugged. ""As long as she doesn't break Mark's heart. He's already talking about moving in together.""

""Already? It's been two months.""

""You know Mark. He falls hard."" Liam turned to me, wrapping an arm around my waist and pulling me close. He smelled of smoke and cologne. ""Unlike me. I only fell hard once. And I'm never getting up.""

I smiled up at him. ""Smooth.""

""I try."" He bussed the tip of my nose. ""You having fun?""

""I am. It's a perfect day.""

""It is,"" he agreed.

Down on the grass, Sophia looked up. She caught us watching—Liam with his arm around me, me smiling up at him.

For a split second, her expression was unreadable. It wasn't envy. It wasn't judgment. It was almost... wistful. A profound sadness that softened her features.

Then, she beamed. She waved a dandelion at us.

""Mia made you a crown, Elena!"" she called out.

""Coming!"" I yelled back.

I pulled away from Liam, leaving him on the deck.

""Duty calls,"" I said.

I walked down the steps into the lush green grass, toward the beautiful girl and my beautiful children, leaving my husband watching from the porch like a guardian.

I sat down next to Sophia. She smelled like vanilla and sunshine.

""You have a beautiful family, Elena,"" she said softly, handing me the flower crown. ""You're very lucky.""

I adjusted the crown on my head, looking back at Liam. He was talking to Mark now, laughing at something, his head thrown back. The sun caught the silver wedding band on his left hand, making it flash.

""I know,"" I said, feeling a surge of affection for this sweet girl who just wanted to belong. ""Thank you, Sophia. Welcome to the family.""

She smiled, and her eyes crinkled at the corners.

""Thank you,"" she whispered. ""I feel like I'm going to fit right in.""

And I believed her.

I didn't see the threat because I was looking for a predator. I was looking for sharp teeth and claws. I didn't know that sometimes, destruction comes wrapped in wildflowers and vanilla. I didn't know that the person who would hold the knife would be someone I invited to sit at my own table.

The Golden Hour

Time in suburbia has a way of blurring the edges of days until they bleed into one seamless, comfortable loop. Spring softened into summer, the humid heat settling in with afternoons that smelled of chlorine and freshly cut grass.

In those months, Sophia didn't just enter our lives; she wove herself into the fabric of them.

It was insidious because it was so helpful. She wasn't an intrusion; she was an asset. She was the one who remembered that Leo liked his sandwich crusts cut off. She was the one who texted me links to swimsuits for Mia when they went on sale. She was the one who laughed at Mark's terrible jokes with a patience I frankly didn't possess.

She became ""Auntie Sophia"" before July had even arrived.

It was a Tuesday in mid-July—the kind of day where the light hits the world at a slant, making everything look like a filtered photograph. Mark was out of town for a conference, and Liam was working late, so I had invited Sophia for a ""girls' day.""

We spent the morning wandering through the upscale boutiques downtown, arms linked, iced coffees in hand. It felt nostalgic. I hadn't had a female friend I could be this effortless with in years. Sarah, my best friend, was fiercely loyal but busy with her own chaotic divorce. Sophia, with her flexible schedule and boundless energy, was always available.

""Oh my god, Elena, look at this,"" Sophia gasped, pulling me toward a mannequin in a store window. It was draped in a silk slip dress, the color of crushed emeralds. ""You have to try this on. It would look insane with your eyes.""

""It's a little... slinky for the PTA meeting,"" I laughed, sipping my latte.

""Not for the PTA. For Liam,"" she said, wiggling her eyebrows. ""Come on. Treat yourself. You work too hard.""

I let her drag me inside.

Standing in the dressing room, the silk cool against my skin, I looked at my reflection. Sophia hovered behind me, adjusting the straps, her hands light and gentle on my shoulders.

""See?"" she whispered, her face appearing next to mine in the mirror. ""Stunning. He's going to have a heart attack.""

I smoothed the fabric over my hips. ""It is beautiful.""

""You have such a great body,"" Sophia said, her voice tinged with a strange kind of awe. She wasn't just complimenting me; she was studying me. ""I hope I look like you when I'm... well, later.""

""When you're ancient?"" I teased.

""When I'm established,"" she corrected. ""You just... you have it all, Elena. The career, the house, the husband who worships the ground you walk on. It's like a fairy tale. Honestly, sometimes it's intimidating.""

I turned to face her. She looked so young in that moment, her blue eyes wide and vulnerable, a smudge of lipstick on her teeth making her seem human and flawed.

""It's not a fairy tale, Soph,"" I said softly. ""It's work.""

""But you guys make it look so easy.""

""Let's get lunch,"" I said, suddenly feeling the need to be honest. ""My treat.""

We ended up at a bistro with outdoor seating, wrapped in the warmth of the summer sun under a parasol, sharing a bottle of Pinot Grigio. The alcohol warmed my blood, loosening the tight knot of perfectionism I usually carried in my chest.

We talked about Mark first—her worries that he was moving too fast, her fear that she wasn't ""ready"" for marriage. I reassured her, playing the role of the wise older sister.

Then, the conversation pivoted.

""Can I ask you something?"" Sophia asked, twirling the stem of her wine glass. ""And you can tell me to shut up if it's too personal.""

""Go ahead.""

""Did you ever... doubt him?"" She looked down at the table. ""Liam, I mean. Did you ever worry he would hurt you?""

I paused. The breeze rustled the leaves in the planter box next to us.

I looked at this girl—this sweet, innocent girl who was trying to navigate her own relationship anxieties by looking to me as a model. I felt a surge of protective instinct. I didn't want to lie to her. I didn't want to paint a false picture of perfection that she could never live up to.

""I didn't just doubt him,"" I said, my voice dropping. ""I almost left him.""

Sophia's head snapped up. Her eyes were wide. ""What?""

I took a deep breath. I hadn't told this story to anyone new in years. Sarah knew. Mark knew. But saying it aloud felt like testing the structural integrity of a bridge I had rebuilt.

""Five years ago,"" I began, ""Liam wasn't the man you know now. We were... struggling. He was distant. Angry. And he was unfaithful.""

The word hung in the air between us.

Sophia went perfectly still. She didn't blink. She didn't breathe. Her face was a mask of shock.

""He... cheated?"" she whispered.

""Yes.""

""Physically?""

""Yes. Multiple times. With different women.""

Sophia covered her mouth with her hand. Her eyes filled with sudden, rapid tears. It was a reaction so visceral, so immediate, that it touched my heart. She wasn't just listening; she was feeling it for me.

""Oh my god, Elena,"" she choked out. ""I... I had no idea. He seems so... he looks at you like you're the only person in the world.""

""He does now,"" I said, reaching across the table to touch her hand. ""He changed, Sophia. He did the work. He went to therapy, he got sober, he cut out the toxic friends. He rebuilt my trust from the ground up.""

""But how?"" she asked, her voice trembling. ""How did you forgive him? I mean... the betrayal. The intimacy. Knowing he was with someone else... how do you not vomit every time you think about it?""

""It took time,"" I admitted. ""And it took a choice. I had to decide if the love was worth the pain. I decided it was.""

Sophia stared at me, a tear tracking slowly down her cheek. She wiped it away angrily.

""You are a saint,"" she said fiercely. ""I couldn't do it. I swear to God, Elena, if Mark ever... if any man ever did that to me, I would burn his life to the ground. I wouldn't have the strength to be as good as you.""

I squeezed her hand. ""You're stronger than you think. But I hope you never have to find out.""

""I just..."" She shook her head, looking genuinely distressed. ""It makes me so sad to think of you hurting like that. You didn't deserve it.""

""No one deserves it,"" I said. ""But it made us who we are. I trust him now more than I did the day I married him. Because I know he knows what he stands to lose.""

Sophia nodded slowly, absorbing this. She took a large gulp of her wine.

""He's a fool if he ever risks you again,"" she said, her voice hard. ""A complete, absolute fool.""

""He knows that,"" I said confidently.

We sat in silence for a moment, the bond between us cementing. I felt lighter for having shared it. It felt like I had brought her into the inner sanctum. She wasn't just Mark's girlfriend anymore; she was my confidante.

""Thank you for telling me,"" Sophia said quietly, her eyes searching mine. ""It... it helps. To know that even perfect things have cracks.""

""The cracks are where the light gets in,"" I quoted, smiling. ""Leonard Cohen.""

""Beautiful,"" she murmured.

Later that afternoon, we went back to my house. The kids were home from school, and the chaos of the evening routine took over. Liam came home around six, looking tired but handsome in his suit, his tie loosened.

""Hey,"" he said, walking into the kitchen where Sophia and I were feeding the kids dinner. He bussed me on the lips—a lingering, soft buss. ""How was your day?""

""Good,"" I said, leaning into him. ""We went shopping.""

""Dangerous,"" he joked. He turned to Sophia. ""Did you survive?""

Sophia was standing by the counter, cutting up strawberries for Mia. She looked at Liam.

I watched her, expecting her to be awkward after learning his dark secret. I expected her to look at him with judgment, or disgust, or at least hesitation.

But she didn't.

She smiled at him. It was a slow, cryptic smile that didn't quite reach her eyes.

""I survived,"" she said. ""Elena was telling me all about your history, Liam.""

The air in the kitchen froze for a microsecond.

Liam stiffened against me. It was subtle—a tensing of the muscles in his arm—but I felt it. He looked at Sophia, his eyes narrowing slightly.

""Oh?"" he said, his voice carefully neutral. ""Hopefully not the boring parts.""

""No,"" Sophia said, popping a piece of strawberry into her mouth. Her lips were stained red from the fruit. ""The redemption arc. It's very... inspiring. You're a lucky man that she gave you a second chance.""

Liam relaxed, letting out a breath I hadn't realized he was holding. He squeezed my waist.

""I know I am,"" he said, looking down at me with pure devotion. ""I thank God for her every day.""

Sophia watched us—the happy couple, the loving embrace.

""Well,"" she said, wiping her hands on a paper towel. ""I should get going. Mark is calling.""

""I'll walk you out,"" I said.

At the door, she hugged me tightly. It was a fierce, desperate hug.

""You're amazing, Elena,"" she whispered in my ear. ""Don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise.""

""Drive safe, Soph.""

I watched her walk to her car, waving as she pulled out of the driveway. I closed the door, feeling a warm glow of contentment. I had a wonderful husband, beautiful children, and now, a genuine friend who admired me.

I walked back into the kitchen where Liam was stealing a piece of Mia's chicken nugget.

""She's intense,"" Liam muttered.

""She's sweet,"" I corrected, wrapping my arms around him from behind. ""She looks up to us.""

""Hmph."" Liam turned in my arms, resting his forehead against mine. ""As long as she knows you're mine.""

""Always,"" I whispered.

I didn't know then. I couldn't have known.

I thought Sophia's tears at lunch were tears of empathy for my pain. I thought her comment about Liam being a ""fool"" was a judgment of his past.

I didn't realize her tears were the product of a twisted guilt, or perhaps the thrill of deception. I didn't realize that when she said I would burn his life to the ground, she wasn't talking about a hypothetical scenario. She was telling me exactly what she was capable of.

And when she ate that strawberry, watching my husband hold me, she wasn't admiring our love.

She was sizing up her competition. And realizing that I had already forgiven the unforgivable once... which meant I might be weak enough to break again.",2,1770483619.0,romancenovels,2,1.0,False
1qyj0k5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qyj0k5,Smg3's guide to expansion (review),"HOLY SHIT SAIKO ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE PLOT!!!!!!11!!

This vid is pretty good (i'm not just saying that since this is the first time in nearly 4 years in which saiko did anything)

The plot is fairly simple but also enjoyable. Smg3 expands his coffee shop, goes overboard, saiko of all characters helps to stop the chaos.

The jokes were kinda funny but nothing much to note. 

WAY more characters appeared than I would've thought. I mean seriously, Toadsworth, Shroomy AND Hal monitor appearing ONTOP of Saiko being a major character? Did the writers just lose their goddamn minds???? What's with the focus on random characters recently? I'm not complaining but it's really shocking considering they've only been focused on the same 5 characters the past 3 years.

The ending was admittedly kinda shit. Hal monitor just appears, arrests SMG3 for building without a permit, and then the video just kinda ends? idk, it could've been better, but it's not like it ruins the video or anything. At the end of the day this is a rare Saiko vid. We take what we can get.

In case you cant tell, this video heavily features Saiko for the first time in forever, which I am VERY happy about. Saiko has alot of untapped potential, especially how she interacts with many characters, most notably SMG3. Prior to this vid, the only time I can really remember the two interacting was in The Mario Hustle. Which was nearly a decade ago at this point. It's a real shame too since their dynamic in this video was pretty good. Their similar, yet contrasting personalities really work well with each other. Hopefully this'll mean more Saiko appearances in the future since it would be really cool and great and awesome and enjoyable and PLEASE SMG4 PLEASE DO MORE WITH SAIKO I NEED THIS SO BADLY PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEA

forgot to mention earlier but mario never appeared in this vid. kinda strange but nothing new.

good vid. 8/10. not the funniest but pretty good. 2026 has been really good so far, but the year has only started, so let's not jinx it.",4,1770483606.0,SMG4,0,1.0,False

###2025 in Review

*Final Standings:  - 11-12-11 (W-L-D) 44 pts, 8th place in the West*

For a team that spent most of its MLS era sleepwalking until late Summer, 2025 proved to be the opposite. What started as the best opening run of form in club history eventually petered out into a hapless, error-prone finish after the Leagues Cup. Finishing in 8th place isn’t disheartening in isolation; the Timbers have seen worse finishes over the last fifteen years. But to fall into the play-in game one year after a disastrous 5-0 loss at the same stage was an incredibly bitter result. Especially so after a Spring that showed so much promise, and a summer transfer window that pushed the chips into the middle.

There’s no other way to put it at this juncture: the Timbers are mired in mediocrity. After Alex Callens’ penalty conversion sealed Portland’s heartbreaking defeat in MLS Cup 2021, the team has lacked any clear direction for how it intends to return to that stage. The roster has been too talented to justify a complete teardown-to-the-studs rebuild, but not good enough to compete at the top of MLS. Longtime stalwarts like Diego Valeri, Sebastian Blanco, Larrys Mabiala, Dairon Asprilla, and others aged out, while younger core pieces like Evander and Santiago Moreno found themselves at odds with the FO (to put it mildly) and soon departed.

In my mind’s eye, 2025 was intended to be the reset without fully *resetting.* Outside of the ageless Diego Chara, Portland entered last year by handing the reins to the youngest starting XI it had in years. Key returning figures like Moreno, Antony, Juan Mosquera, David Ayala, and Finn Surman were 25 or younger. While offseason acquisitions like Jimer Fory, Kevin Kelsy, and prized DP-signing David da Costa added to that youthful exuberance with a touch of fresh energy. Factor in the steady veteran presence of Jonathan Rodriguez, Felipe Mora, Dario Zuparic, and others, and the idea was credible on paper: build around an athletic young core, supplement that core with steady leadership, and survive any early wobbles knowing it’ll benefit the club moving forward.

I was prepared for the rollercoaster ride inherent to a young team, but I was sold on the vision. And my stock kept rising as the squad only lost three times from early March to late June. From that moment forward, though, Portland would only win three times for the rest of the season.

There’s an old saying that “potential” is a sugarcoated way of meaning “not good enough right now. And boy was that the case. The team wasn’t just young, it was flawed.

Of that core, two (Moreno and Ayala) no longer wear green and gold, with Moreno’s sudden and acrimonious departure marking an inflection point midseason. The young acquisitions weren’t ready to shoulder the load of a team whose veteran pieces fell into a chasm, whether through poor form or injury. And of the three major midseason additions, only Kristoffer Velde was healthy enough to make any notable impact.

It was a confluence of suckage. Not enough health for a consistent lineup, no schematic identity to link the disparate pieces together, and no overwhelming star power to paper over the cracks. And unsurprisingly, as soon as Portland faced a well-drilled San Diego side with the best player on the field in any given matchup, the Timbers were blitzed in three of the four meetings that concluded the 2025 campaign.

So, where does that leave us now? Well, largely in the same spot we’ve been since that fateful December 2021 penalty shootout: the purgatory of mediocrity. The Timbers have been lapped by much of its rivals, and it’s hard to see the club escaping it anytime soon.

----
###The Coach


*Phil Neville*

I truly want it to work for Neville, maybe moreso than any coach in the club’s history. I genuinely believe he gets it: he gets what it means to be the Head Coach of the Portland Timbers. He gets how the club is more than eleven players knocking around a polyurethane ball; it’s an institution physically and metaphorically interwoven into the fabric of its hometown. 

But I don’t believe he gets how to win at this level. 

From his Inter Miami days onward, Neville has yet to establish a coherent tactical identity. Sometimes, he says he wants to play on the front foot, but largely, his teams are most dynamic in transition. Often, he mentions being a team most suited to play in a 4-2-3-1, but then he’ll line up in a 5-back - one that got shelled all season long - in a do-or-die postseason match.

Defensively, it’s often ragged, as the midfield and defense are structurally disconnected. But in his attempts to resolve it, a higher defensive line frequently exacerbates the disjointedness, allowing free runners with more dangerous space to exploit. Maybe it’s too much tinkering, maybe it’s not enough. But the simple reality is that Neville is a mediocre coach leading a club trying to escape mediocrity.

If there’s one reason for optimism, though, the former England int’l generally gets the best out of key attacking pieces. He turned an out-of-shape, disengaged Gonzalo Higuain back into a major goalscoring force in South Florida, helped Evander turn a corner towards an MVP-caliber season in 2024, and oversaw Antony’s transformation into a more consistent attacking presence pre-hamstring strain.

With Portland requiring major productivity jumps from the likes of Kristoffer Velde, David da Costa, and Kevin Kelsy, maybe there’s a glimmer of hope for a pleasant surprise.

But if not, this will likely be Neville’s last season in MLS.

###Departures

**David Ayala (DM):** In the offseason’s most surprising move, Portland shipped the Argentine U22 player to Inter Miami for an underwhelming $2M return. In a vacuum, the move makes sense. Ayala was in the last year of his contract - one unlikely to be renewed - and the pull to play with Lionel Messi/for former teammate Javier Mascherano - needs no further explanation. However, for a player presumed to be Diego Chara’s heir apparent, or at a minimum, a core component moving forward, the transfer means the Timbers’ Chara succession plan is back to Square 1. For the uncertainty surrounding Grabavoy’s acumen, I’m not disillusioned enough to believe he doesn’t have a semblance of a plan for *the* central roster-building Portland has faced since….well, the entire MLS era. But losing a talented young defensive midfielder, one who could easily become one of the league’s best in Miami, doesn’t instill confidence in a long-term direction either.

**Dario Župarić (CB):** For the first time since pre-COVID, the Timbers enter an MLS campaign without Dario Župarić’s services. The Croatian was clearly never one of Neville’s favorites, starting each of the last two seasons on the squad periphery. But eventually injuries and poor performance from his counterparts inevitably led him back into the fray. He’s a high-ish floor, low-ceiling defender with a trademark Balkan bite, just not quite enough athleticism or physical dominance to cement himself as an insurmountable starter. He’d be a valuable depth CB for a contending MLS side, which seems to be his ambition while he trains for fitness with hometown club Cibalia.

**Cristhian Paredes (CM):** Like Župarić, Cristhian Paredes’ departure signifies the loss of another long-time Timber. However, also mirroring his former teammate, this move was years in the making. Joining the club as a teenager, Paredes spent the better part of a decade in Portland, often finding himself on the precipice of a star turn. It just….never happened. For periods, it would all click, but for much of his career, he was a replacement-level MLS midfielder. Promising enough to stick around, but not effective enough to cement himself as a bona fide starter. Though his Portland story didn’t end as hoped, every Timbers supporter wishes him nothing but success in a return to his native Paraguay.

**Maxime Crepeau (GK):** In a move that promised stability to a revolving-door position, Crepeau’s stint in Portland failed to fulfill the promise. Undoubtedly a great dude with a valuable locker room presence, the Canadian struggled with injuries and international break disruptions that likely contributed to an error-prone tenure in Oregon. Now in Orlando, hopefully, he can regain the form that saw him rise to one of MLS’ best keepers during his time in Vancouver and LA.

**Felipe Carballo (CM):** Few circumstances scream “Portland injury luck” more than a DP signing tearing their ACL two matches after signing with the club. I’d want to laugh if it weren’t tragic for both player and club, especially since the Uruguayan would be a written-in-ink starter given Ayala’s departure and his pedigree as a fringe national team player. The former loanee continues to face a long recovery battle, with his future at parent club Gremio all but over. However, if there’s a glimmer of light in an extremely unfortunate situation, the door may not be closed on his story in Timbers’ green. Grabavoy and Co. have rated Carballo for multiple seasons, and the injury likely drops his price-tag below the DP threshold for a potential midseason reunion. 

**Matias Rojas (AM):** Similar to his Uruguayan counterpart, Rojas arrived last Summer hoping to play a key role in the stretch run but spent more time on the training table than on the pitch. I’m not sure the marriage was expected to last into 2026, given salary cap concerns. However, Rojas is clearly a technically gifted midfielder with the talent to provide some team quality depth if he stays healthy enough to leverage it.

(soon) **Jonathan Rodriguez (ST/LW):** Our third and final injured South American in this section, Rodriguez arrived in 2024 as a prized DP attacking signing, largely living up to the billing despite a few questionable moments in front of net. And heading into 2025, Rodriguez was forecasted to be the steady secondary goalscoring threat to maximize chance creation and alleviate concerns over output from the #9 position. Instead, we got nebulous details and recovery timelines for a preseason knee injury, one that clearly hampered him to the point of being a complete shell upon return in late Spring. It was a PTSD-inducing period for Timbers fans who experienced the exact scenario with Felipe Mora a few years prior. And like Mora, Rodriguez would eventually be ruled out long-term with a career-threatening surgery to resolve the issue. At local media days, Grabavoy confirmed what seems obvious on the surface: Rodriguez’s time in Portland is complete. It’s untenable to keep a highly-paid, 32-year-old facing, at a minimum, another lost season on the books. How they choose to part ways is still TBD, but it’s only a matter of time.

###2026 Outlook:

Well, I’m sure the first few sections were as enjoyable for Timbers supporters to read as they were for me to write. But at this point, there’s no escaping the reality that the championship window is firmly shut.

The benefit of the doubt is gone, as are the days when regular-season struggles could be excused away by elite attacking talent willing the team to trophy competitiveness when games mattered the most. It’s been almost five years since Portland last finished in the Top 5 of the Western Conference, an even more damning stat when you consider the team would have been excluded from the playoffs in 2024 and 2025 if the format remained from that 2021 season. The Timbers may be a ‘small-market’ club. But the Timbers are not low-spenders, nor is it a team with a fanbase satisfied by scrapping out mid-table finishes. That trendline needs to end in 2026, or else it’s truly time to blow it up and start all over. 

Point blank - it’s an *earn it* year for all involved. It’s an *earn it* year for Ned Grabavoy to prove he can put together a roster capable of competing at the top of the West. It’s an *earn it* year for Phil Neville to prove he’s worthy of continued employment. And it’s an *earn it* year for a roster with talent on paper but not enough consistent performances to match. Even for a fanbase that backs its club like few others, patience is waning, particularly as ticket prices rise and support for ownership bottoms out.

I refuse to throw in the towel quite yet, though. Optimism might be low - but it’s not gone. The thing with having talent, especially young talent, you can’t rule out the squad finding the secret sauce put it all together.

Kristoffer Velde is an animal, for better or worse. But if he can match his contagious energy with the final product he displayed in the playoffs, he has the juice to carry the team. David da Costa, Cole Bassett, and Antony are mercurial talents with the capacity to produce moments of magic, and just need a touch more consistency to become real weapons. Juan David Mosquera and Jimer Fory are dynamic outside backs with potential European futures given more defensive discipline, and again, a tad more consistency. And Finn Surman is legitimately one of MLS's best young CBs, which is not something Portland has ever said about one of its central defenders.

A few more signings, especially on the right wing, center midfield, and center defense, and there’s enough depth to remain competitive too. So, all hope is not lost. The Timbers just need that hope to materialize into good fortune and a few positive surprises.

And it’s the hope that kills you, right?

###Acquisitions:

**Cole Bassett (CM):** In the first step to replacing David Ayala, Portland went in a completely different direction than I had anticipated. For years, Portland has run a double-pivot, choosing more defensive-minded 8s with passing range to free Diego Chara to roam, and let the 10 assume the bulk of chance-creation responsibilities. Cole Bassett isn’t that mold at all. He isn’t a complete non-factor from a physical standpoint, but his bread and butter comes from his ability on the ball, range in ground-covering, and danger with late runs into the final third. It’s a very intriguing fit next to David da Costa, hinting at a more fluid dual-8 attacking approach, similar to how Caleb Porter employed Nagbe and Valeri in a 4-3-3 during the MLS Cup run in 2015. Partially due to injuries, partially due to the Rapids being the Rapids, and partially due to being played out of position, it wasn’t Bassett’s strongest season last year. But this move has him poised for a career renaissance in the Pacific Northwest. 

**Alex Bonetig (CB):** Scouting the A-League for central defenders worked so well with Finn Surman, Portland went back to well for the Western Sydney product. Bonetig is one of Australia’s brightest defensive starlets, a left-footed center back with immense comfort and productivity on the ball, who also finished second in the league in aerial duels won. In an ideal world, he brings a bit of guile and finesse to pair with Surman’s brawn. But at a lean build, I anticipate adjusting to MLS’ speed and physicality will take some time. Hopefully, without the same language barrier some of Portland’s previous imports have faced, that acclimation period is less drawn-out, and he can play his way into the eyes of Tony Popovic’s Socceroos by next Summer. 

**Brandon Bye (RB/RCB?):** Signed to push Juan Mosquera, Bye is a more balanced outside back than Portland has had at its disposal in recent years. Even if deemed surplus in New England, I believe Bye still has the requisite talent to be a productive player at this level. And in an interesting wrinkle, it seems they’ve tinkered with him as a RCB in a 5-back during preseason as well. He’s the profile of league veteran that MLS teams need, but the Timbers haven’t necessarily hit on in recent seasons. With playing time potentially available in two places, perhaps Brandon bucks that trend in 2026.

**Starting-level RW:** At the time of writing, this player hasn’t been signed. But [reports suggest it’ll be Club America flameout and ex-Feyenoord and Hertha Berlin winger Javairo Dilrosun](https://bsky.app/profile/tombogert.bsky.social/post/3mcgbhyffgk2m), who said his goodbyes to Mexico just days ago. The fit makes a ton of sense; Dilrosun had a cup of coffee with LAFC last season, performing at a decent level for this league. And with a potential allegiance switch to Suriname on the cards, a good run of form could see him be part of a squad that’s two winnable matches away from World Cup qualification. He’s a starting-level inverted winger to contrast and compete with Antony, but at a friendly cap hit without a transfer fee. I suppose the signing is only a matter of time, but knowing the Timbers, it’ll fall through, and the team will be scrambling for a replacement throughout the Spring.

**Starting-level CDM:** This one is more conceptual than it is imminent. Playing a season with defensive midfield depth amounting to a 40-year old Chara, a questionable Joao Ortiz, and unknown Homegrown players is entirely untenable. Beyond a few loose rumors out of Europe, it’s unclear who the addition(s) will be. But I fully anticipate one arriving within the next few weeks.

###A word on everyone else:

**Goalkeepers:**

**James Pantemis (GK):** Arriving alongside Max Crepeau in the 2024 offseason, many presumed Pantemis wouldn’t be more than a footnote acquisition. Two years later, though, Pants unquestionably outshone his Montrealais compatriot, finally cementing the #1 job for himself in 2026. Even with a few occasional gaffes, James has generally been a major plus in net, with a penchant for spectacular saves, including against three of five PKs he faced last season. However, like many in the squad, 2026 is the biggest year of Pantemis’ career. He has the opportunity to earn his way onto a World Cup squad, and the opportunity to prove himself equipped to be the long-term face in Portland’s net - something the club has never really had. With fewer bobbled shots and cleaner distribution with his feet, that’s all well within reach. And given Portland’s recent defensive frailties, the team will absolutely need it too.

**Trey Muse (GK):** The 26-year-old keeper has largely been relegated to 3rd GK duty behind Pantemis and Crepeau, but with Maxime’s departure, Trey Muse is next in line should Pantemis be absent for any match. Still mostly an unknown, Muse earned plaudits during his time at Charleston Battery in the USL. However, that 2023 season remains the last time he played a bulk of his club’s matches. We’ll likely know more about his future in green-and-gold this season.

**Hunter Sulte (GK):** Following a season on loan with Indy Eleven where he conceded 38 times with 5 clean sheets, the Homegrown GK returns to Portland with his best opportunity to climb the depth chart. Muse is likely in pole-position for the backup job as it stands, but Sulte’s 6’7 athletic frame is enticing. If nothing else, expect him to see starting reps for T2.


**Defenders:**

**Juan David Mosquera (RB):** Three years into the Juan Mosquera experiment, and we’re roughly still in the same place. On the ball and pushing forward, he’s still supremely talented. Defensively, he’s still sometimes switched on and sometimes switched to wondering what time it is in Mozambique. Having his close friend in Moreno force his way out of the club midseason probably didn’t help, but 2025 didn’t wasn’t the breakthrough we expected for someone being monitored by European clubs. And that’s disappointing given his coach is a former Premier League fullback with the knowledge to get him to that next level. Will 2026 be the year it all clicks for Mosquera? Or is it yet another player where ‘close to a leap’ is never close enough?

**Finn Surman (CB):** The 2025 Supporter’s Player of the Year, Surman is one of the squad’s best players - and one of the most talented young defenders in MLS. I don’t think he’s earned the national plaudits he deserves, largely because the defending around him has bordered on tragic. But for all of Portland’s woes, the big Kiwi has not been one of them. Even at 22-years-old, Finn is a top choice to wear the armband should Chara or Mora be off the pitch. And I’d say he’s poised to be a stalwart for years to come if there weren’t an upcoming World Cup where, barring injury, I have a feeling he’ll raise some eyebrows with his pace, positioning, and physical prowess. We’ve seen our fair share of dumpster fire defenders. It’s nice knowing we have at least one who is not.

**Jimer Fory (LB):** Jimer Fory is chaos: good chaos, bad chaos, and everything in-between. It’s one thing to play on the edge, and another to routinely skydive off of it. Jimer often chooses both, recklessly diving into challenges while on a yellow card, which is generally his circumstance considering he damn near averaged a card per game to start his Timbers era. At this point, it’s difficult to tell how much of that is a young player trying to make his name in a new league versus the lens through which he interprets the game. But either way, Portland needs a more disciplined version in 2026, because he possesses the tools to be a very successful left back in this league. At all of 6’2, he’s a physical force with the pace, technical ability, and silky left peg to take his career to the next level. He just has to avoid routinely shooting the team in the foot first. 

**Kamal Miller (CB):** Off the back of a strong tenure at CF Montreal, World Cup starts in 2022, and some impressive performances with Messi’s Inter Miami, it felt like a move to Portland would be the long-term move Miller needed for his career. To this point, it has not gone according to plan. Outside of a few sporadic moments, Miller’s lack of athleticism has been exposed in a muddled defensive structure. He’s decent in distribution but often outgunned when the game is stretched - just as he was when he slid out Brian White for a red card 10 minutes into last season. By signing someone of Bonetig’s profile, it’s clear Miller is under serious threat as a starter moving forward. Perhaps with squad pressure and a World Cup call-up to work for, Kamal unlocks a level he hasn’t been at for a few years. Otherwise, it’s probably his last campaign in Portland.

**Zac McGraw (CB):** A player with so much physical potential, it’s largely been downhill for the West Point alum since Neville’s appointment. And after a back injury sidelined McGraw throughout 2025, the Canadian international recently underwent a surgery that will rule him out until after the World Cup break. It’s a blow to depth in a position lacking it, and the anticipated return timeline is tricky to navigate. Does the staff choose to find another capable body, especially given McGraw’s recent on-field struggles? Or do they rely on T2 guys like Charles Ondo for half a season and reevaluate in the Summer? The first is certainly the more appealing option to Timbers supporters, although it requires threading the needle for someone who is cost-effective, willing to sit on the bench, and still capable enough when called upon.

**Eric Miller (RB/RCB/LB):** The journeyman MLS defender is five appearances away from matching his career high with a single club, but with Brandon Bye’s arrival, it’ll likely come in late substitute appearances to close up shop. For what he lacks in any semblance of attacking value, he puts in a shift defensively anywhere along the backline. And when your two starting outside backs are Jimer Fory and Juan Mosquera, that’s a more valuable asset than it seems on paper.

**Ian Smith (LB):** A 2025 first-round SuperDraft pick, Smith emerged last preseason as a serviceable rotational option, unseating Claudio Bravo as the primary backup to Jimer Fory. It was a welcome development for a club that largely stashes away draft picks to rot on the 2nd team, and Smith’s versatility at LB, LWB, and LCB will continue to provide value in 2026. At times, he struggled with tricky and/or athletic wingers in 1v1 situations, especially without central coverage. But knowing Fory’s propensity to be suspended, he’ll have more than ample opportunity to show improvement in that area this campaign.

**Sawyer Jura (RB/LB):** The 19-year-old Homegrown product injured last preseason and spent a bulk of the year as the #1 outside back option for T2. With the veteran depth Portland has at the position, it’s hard to see that dynamic changing in the near term.

*Note on Homegrowns: The Timbers are notoriously futile when it comes to producing Homegrown talent and pushing them through the pipeline. Perhaps that starts to change this year, as Homegrowns Eric Izoita, Daniel Nunez, Noah Santos, and others have seen significant action thus far in preseason. Something to keep an eye on!*

*Additionally, T2 defender Charles Ondo, who started a match for Equatorial Guinea at the recent AFCON, could be a potential signing, especially with poor CB depth*

**Midfielders:**

**Diego Chara (CDM):** He said he’d be playing until he was 40, and by God, he’s about to do it. Chara needs no further introduction; he’s grown from a Timbers legend into a league legend, a player whose playstyle once drew ire but whose impact/longevity now engenders leaguewide respect. 

Problem is, Chara may age differently than we mere mortals, but relying on him as a starting fulcrum during possibly (likely?) his last season is far from ideal. So, when asked about replacing Ayala, having Neville pivot to “Diego Chara is more fit than he was last season,” is an immediate alarm bell for me. He’s good enough to still be a contributor, but he deserves more than being run into the ground due to a lack of effective alternatives. Hopefully, if this is truly it, the captain, leader, and legend gets the fairytale ending he deserves.

**Kristoffer Velde (LW):** *“We need spiciness in the group” - Kristoffer Velde, during preseason*

Norwegian cuisine might not be known for its high Scoville rating, but the Timbers’ Norwegian DP is certainly the club’s *spiciest* leader. Perhaps it’s the Argentine in him, but parallels to Sebastian Blanco, both in style and swagger, are extremely evident. Velde plays with a zeal that became apparent from the moment he donned the shirt, immediately winning over the fanbase despite some initial on-field struggles. He’ll be a player the Timbers love, while the opposition loves to hate. The question now is, will his fire light up the nets? Or will it boil over into frustration?

**David da Costa (AM):** Signed to be the next stellar Timbers DP #10, I’d argue Portland accidentally stumbled upon the next incarnation of Darlington Nagbe. Stellar technique on the ball? Check. Sporadic final third ruthlessness? Check. Decent shot when he wants to use it? Check. Questions over best positional fit? Check. 

DDC doesn’t have the same strength or low center of gravity that Darlington had, just as Nagbe never had the left foot *le petit prince* is willing to use. But otherwise, the comparison works. And it’s why I’m so bullish on the potential of a Bassett-da Costa partnership, provided the right fit at the #6 role. The Lens product’s talent is obvious, earning a Coach’s selection to the 2025 All-Star Game. However, he exacerbated a lingering shoulder injury in the Leagues Cup, clearly impacting his form, as it fell off a cliff in the late Summer. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Portland struggled as he struggled, and hopefully, offseason surgery helps him find something resembling peak confidence and comfort in Year 2.

**Antony (LW/RW/RWB):** Production dropping dramatically post-injury, where have I heard that before? Before a June hamstring strain, the Brazilian experienced the best form of his young career, registering 11 goal contributions. Following the injury, though, Antony only registered one goal contribution for the remainder of the regular season. His 2026 outlook will (hopefully) be less injury-dependent and more predicated on how Neville intends to play. In transition, the U22 initiative player is lethal, using his pace, workrate, and flair to run channels and exploit open space. In a more front-foot, possession approach, Antony can be a square peg in a round hole. For that reason, it’s no surprise Portland is looking to add a starting-level attacking option, especially when he appears more comfortable in Velde’s left winger role than on the right. 

**Joao Ortiz (CDM):** I genuinely feel for Joao Ortiz. You move your family 4,500 miles from home, arrive to a new culture with a language barrier, have to fulfill expectations of immediate production, and it just doesn’t go well.  Ortiz was intended to add bite and physicality to central midfield, but he was often a step late, step slow, step off the pace, or a step out of position. It clearly drained his confidence to the point where Neville made a concerted effort to heap praise on him in post-match pressers when he probably didn’t deserve it. Now in Year 2, there’s hope that a more settled player will be a more productive one, as is often the case in MLS. It’s just hard to bank on that outcome given what we saw last year. 

**Omir Fernandez (AM):** The former Rapids and RBNY midfielder is a solidly average MLS midfielder, but perhaps in the best way possible. He may not be a true difference-maker, but he consistently provides 6/10 performances when surrounding pieces are far more volatile. Unfortunately, though, Omir was the first Timber to succumb to the injury bug in 2026, suffering a broken foot that will render him sidelined until beyond the World Cup. It’s not a death knell, but it is a disappointment given the lack of attacking midfield depth behind a still-recovering da Costa. 

**Ariel Lassiter (LW/RW):** Although not often reflected on the stat sheet, Lassiter turned out to be an astute signing. The Costa Rican works hard, offers positional flexibility, can whip in an effective cross, bridges the language gap between Angolophones/Hispanohablantes, and does so without expectations of major minutes. A good depth piece to have.

**Forwards:**

**Felipe Mora (ST):** As someone holding loads of Mora stock, 2025 was a tough year. For a player who bagged goals routinely, even after his arduous injury layoff between 2022-23, he looked so uncharacteristically out of sorts in front of net last season. Whether it was the yips, discoordination between him and his midfield chance creators, or some combination of both, it’s hard to pinpoint exactly why. But Portland needs vintage Mora more than ever this season. 

**Kevin Kelsy (ST):** It’s so easy to be frustrated by Kevin Kelsy. If you pay $5M for a striker, it’s hard to be enamored with someone who has a nonexistent right foot, occasionally looks like he’s running his own race out there, and is liable to hold on to the ball *wayyyyyyy* too long. But then you remember he’s only 21 years old, living in a foreign country, learning how to be an adult, and yet, already has 29 career goals to his name. Kelsy is likely a shell of the player he may become in a few years, and a double-digit goal total is well within the realm of possibility this season. And if he can get there, it’d be a major win for the club.

**Gage Guerra (ST):** After a goal-filled preseason and start to life at T2, Guerra was mostly a non-factor for the first team outside of two remarkably clutch headed goals in the US Open Cup and MLS Cup Playoffs, respectively. To his own admission, the jump to MLS level was a whirlwind in his first season, and the jury is out whether he’ll amount to more than someone who straddles the first and second teams. Perhaps with more comfort, the USL goal-scoring form will translate more this season. But he’ll likely have to prove it in limited-minute substitute appearances.

**Best Case Scenario:**

Portland’s blueprint for making MLS Cup runs in ‘15, ‘18, and ‘21 wasn’t complicated: be difficult to beat, dominate in transition, and let matchwinners be exactly that. In its MLS era, the club has finished with a level/negative goal differential six times: twice in the first two seasons, and three times in the last five years. Put simply, in the recent past, the Timbers just haven’t been difficult to beat.

In the best-case scenario, that changes this season. With dynamic attacking players capable of interchanging fluidly, Portland scores goals by the bunches. With Alex Bonetig’s arrival and Finn Surman’s increasing command, the Timbers have a centerback duo that rivals anyone in the league. Pair that with a more mature Jimer Fory, a settled starter in James Pantemis, and a likely arrival of a key #6, and the defensive spine avoids being splattered whenever the attacking thrust isn’t firing on all cylinders.

The Timbers commit to the identity that made them so successful a half-decade ago, Neville unlocks the attacking potential of David da Costa and Antony, and Portland is firmly a playoff team that no one will enjoy seeing in November.


**Worst Case Scenario:**

Wooden spoon contention might be a bridge too far, but the Timbers fully bottom out of mediocrity in 2026. Neither #9 is productive in front of net, the DPs are mercurial but largely underwhelming, Bonetig takes too long to adapt, and the Timbers hemorrhage goals for the fifth consecutive season.

It proves to be the final year of the Phil Neville experiment, as the club spends the summer break planning to sell off the likes of Juan Mosquera, Antony, and Kevin Kelsy, knowing that their value isn’t likely to increase during a dismal stretch run. 

It’s a completely lost season in a year that confirms the club’s drop into irrelevance.

**Realistic Scenario and Prediction:**

What can we *truly* count on with this team? At least from a positive sense, it’s hard to pinpoint much. 

I can count on Kristoffer Velde embodying the opposite of DPs who treated MLS like a beach vacation. I can count on a few moments of magic from Antony, a few otherworldly saves from Pantemis, and a few slaloming runs from da Costa. And I believe I can count on Finn Surman being an upper-echelon MLS centerback. Beyond that? It’s difficult.

With so much uncertainty and multiple data points to suggest that Portland’s player development hardly produces exponential returns, I lean towards the negative outlook.

I’m willing to bet this is Neville’s last season, whether he is fired midseason or in November. He said it himself: finishing in 8th again wouldn’t be up to standard; he has to win now. And without a coherent tactical identity, I’m just not convinced the pieces will fit well enough to eclipse that threshold with the room to justify retention.

Realistically, barring injury, the attacking talent is dynamic enough to keep the team off the MLS floor. It’s just not consistent enough to compensate for the leaky defensive structure. I’ll say the Timbers finish 10th in the West, Neville is sacked in August, and Portland starts planning a full-scale rebuild this offseason.

And more than anything, I hope I’m writing this preview in 2027 while reviewing this prediction with egg on my face and crow in my belly.

Silent reflux guy here. Its been an insanely stressful time trying to get past this stupid illness. Food used to be my comfort. I also used to treat myself to food before I got reflux. Im not sure if this is important, but I got reflux from a vocal injury(long term strain, then laryngitis then vpocal muscle tension then reflux), and chronic stress.

Im skinny as well, im like almost 6ft and around 69kg. So the pain isnt that im overweight. I find its harder to stick to diets when Im depressed and I keep going back. Ive been fighting this for 10 months, and Ive still yet to have 14 days of zero trigger foods(sometimes I thought I did, but turns out I wasnt because certain foods I thought were safe were triggering). Even the safe foods feel triggering. I also live an extremely stressful life and its been like that for years, so alot of the time I dont even know if my flare ups are from stress or not eating the right food.

Main post:

Anyway, my current diet consists only of oatmeal, cottage cheese, chicken, ground turkey, rice. Thats all. Zero seasonings, and obviously bland, and my meat is fried in the frying pan with EVOO, but im switching to the spray. I figured the more rigorous the diet the better. Avoiding coffee isnt an issue for me, its just buying random snacks. Like the biggest example is a protein bar or a cookie.

Does the diet get easier to sustain after a certain streak? I relapsed today on mcdonalds of all things lmao. Its even harder to stay LPR friendly because I work a physical job, study intensely since im also a STEM uni student, AND i hit the gym, ive basically been in a continuous cut and been constantly losing weight since summer last year. So since my TDEE is so high it is very hard to stay away from non bland foods. And frankly, it gets depressing, especially when non reflux people keep saying ""treat yourself to some food if youre sad"" or ""how do you even live with those depression meals""

If it got easier to keep the diet up, when did it happen? Also, is it possible to fully cure reflux if youre stressed? I cant do much about the stress.",1,1770483547.0,GERD,3,1.0,False

Stiff sole, zero flex. Looks clean in pics, hurts by the second block. That star logo? Only cool if you’re not walking far.



Nike Dunk Low Sneakers

Blue Swoosh shifts in sunlight. Tongue slides sideways instantly. Still looks great with black jeans — just don’t plan a hike.



Nike Dunk Low Sneakers

Rope laces stay tied. Bandana fabric stains if you touch anything damp. Reverse Swoosh feels like a hidden win. Love it, but it’s high-maintenance.



Nike Air Jordan 4 Sneakers

Grey leather hides scuffs. Mesh breathes even in humidity. Plastic wings don’t squeak. The only pair I grabbed three days straight.



Nike Air Max 90 Sneakers

Thin sole = every crack punches your heel. Mint green looks fresh, but one raindrop ruins the vibe. Too fragile for real life.



Nike Air Jordan 1

Denim-like upper picks up lint and coffee splashes fast. Midsole yellowed in a week — but weirdly fits the worn-in look. Perfect for lazy days.

All-white but not “keep-in-box” white. Orange Jumpman is tiny — only real heads notice. Walked 3 miles. Zero pain. Quiet winner.

**3 - Paranoia**

I woke up to the sharp, unmistakable smell of ammonia.

Toby had pissed right in the middle of the oak floor. I stared at the puddle, more confused than angry. Toby hasn't had an accident in a while, and even then, he only ever leaked when he was severely overstimulated, usually the frantic, tail wagging ""happy pee"" when I’d come home and gave him pets. But there was nothing that could have hyped him up. He was just sitting in the corner, staring at the hallway that led to the deck, wagging his tail.

I spent the first hour of our vacation on my hands and knees, scrubbing at the wood flooring and praying the salt-air hadn't already pulled the moisture into the grain. Once the floor was dry, I had to wrestle Toby into the tub for a bath. By the time I was finished, my shirt was soaked, my back ached, and my mood was thoroughly shot.

I dried him off with a rough towel, watching him shake himself out. He was acting sluggish, his usual morning energy replaced by a wary, quiet tension. I chalked it up to the move and his age. Seven years is a long time for a dog, and maybe the stress of a new environment was finally catching up to his bladder.

*“One more time, Toby”* I muttered, pointing a finger at him. *“If you do this again, we’re taking that thirty-minute drive to the vet.”*

He didn't lean into my hand for a scratch like he usually does. He just walked back to the big windows and sat down, his eyes fixed on the empty, sun-bleached beach. I drank my coffee black and watched Toby snub his kibble again. The kibble sat untouched in his bowl, but I wasn't going to let it ruin the morning. We needed air.

I clipped a leash onto his collar. Usually, I’d let him roam, but after the morning's accident, I wasn't taking chances. As we stepped onto the sand, I felt a weight in my chest. This trip was for him. If he wasn't happy, if the house was stressing him out, I’d pack it in and head home early.

But as soon as his paws hit the wet sand, Toby transformed. His tail went up, his nose started working the breeze, and he looked five years younger. Walking along the shoreline, my mind drifted to my conversation with my mother. She and my father had stayed at this exact house just a few weeks prior. She’d mentioned a beached whale. A massive thing that had washed up nearby. I scanned the coast as we walked, looking for a massive ribcage or a rotting mound of blubber, but the beach was pristine. No carcass, no bones, not even a lingering scent of decay. It was like the ocean had just... taken it back.

Suddenly, Toby lunged with a wagging tail. He hit the end of the leash with surprising strength, trying to charge into the white foam.

*""Hey! Easy""* I grunted, bracing my heels into the sand. *""It's just birds, Toby. Don't get ahead of yourself.""*

He was fixated on the water, panting with a frantic kind of joy. I followed his gaze. Far out, nearly at the horizon, I saw a flash of that same red color from the night before. It was long, thin, bobbing momentarily before the swell swallowed it whole. I pulled Toby back, but I couldn't stop smiling. Seeing him this energetic was a relief. Whatever had spooked him last night seemed forgotten in the daylight. When we got back to the house, the change was permanent. Toby didn't just eat his kibble, he polished off the entire bowl in seconds and sat by the bag, whining for seconds. I filled it halfway back up, feeling like our holiday together was finally back on track.

I headed back into town for supplies, but the atmosphere had shifted. The moment I stepped into the grocery store, the casual indifference of the previous day was gone. Heads turned. Conversations died mid-sentence. The clerk at the meat counter didn't even look up as I passed, though I could feel her eyes on my back.

I wasn’t in the mood for an interrogation. I pulled my headphones out of my pocket, jammed them in, and turned the volume up until the world was just a muffled hum. I kept my head down, grabbed a few days' worth of groceries, and headed for the checkout. Even through the music, the silence in the store felt heavy.

As I was loading the bags into the back of the car, a shadow fell over the tailgate. I turned, ready to snap at whoever was trying to corner me, but it was just an old woman. She looked like she’d spent her whole life in the sun. Skin like cracked leather and eyes that seemed a bit too tired. I pulled one earbud out, expecting a lecture about the beach house.

She didn't waste time with a ""hello."" She didn't even look me in the eye. She just reached out and pressed something small and plastic into the palm of my hand.

*""Watch out""* she said. Her voice was thin and brittle. *""And take these. You’ll need them dear.""*

I looked down. Two pairs of industrial-grade silicone earplugs sat in my hand. By the time I looked back up to ask what the hell she was talking about, she was already climbing into an old sedan three spots down. She didn't look back as she drove away.

By the time I hit the gravel of the driveway, the unease had hardened into a decision. I don’t believe in the supernatural. I don’t believe in monsters or seaside curses or whatever local flavor of madness these people were peddling. But the atmosphere was toxic, and it was starting to get under my skin. I gripped the steering wheel and stared at the house. Two more days, I told myself. That was the compromise. It was enough time for Toby to get his fill of the salt air and the sand, but short enough that I wouldn't lose my mind to the town’s collective paranoia.

I looked down at the earplugs sitting in the cupholder. For a split second, a ridiculous thought crossed my mind: *“Should I shove these into Toby’s ears?”* I shook my head and while looking at the rejuvenated happy Toby sitting next to me, a dry, humorless laugh escaped my throat.

*""Two more days for you, pal""* I muttered, ruffling his ears. *""Then we’re out of here.""*

To calm my nerves, I tore into a bag of chips and uncorked a bottle of Pinot Noir. I worked through both in no time, the wine hitting my system with a heavy, sedative heat. I figured a nap would do me some good, so I stretched out on the sofa. When I woke up, the room was swallowed in shadows. It was already dark.

Toby was at the window again, his tail thumping against the floor in a steady, excited rhythm. He looked thrilled, his eyes locked on the blackness outside. I stood up and joined him, squinting through the glass, but I couldn't see a thing. *“Nothing to worry about, He’s just having the time of his life.”* I thought to myself.

I made a quick dinner, and Toby demolished his kibble with the same frantic appetite he'd had earlier. As soon as he finished, he ran to the door, barking and scratching to get out. My hand went to the handle automatically, but all the warnings from before flashed in my mind.

*""Better safe than sorry,""* I told him, grabbing the leash. *""I'm not losing you in the dark.""*

The second we stepped onto the deck, Toby bolted. He tried to charge straight for the waves, the leash snapping taut and nearly jerking my arm out of its socket. He was desperate to get to the water. I had to physically pick him up, his legs still paddling in the air, and drag him back inside. I started to scold him, but I stopped. He just looked so happy, so energized. I didn't want to ruin it.

He went right back to his post at the window. Despite his protests and a few frustrated head-shakes, I managed to wedge the earplugs into his ears. I don't know why I did it, maybe I just wanted to feel like I was doing something. I took his spot at the glass, staring out into the void where the waves were crashing. For the briefest of moments, the light from the kitchen caught something out there. Two points of reflection, staring back at me from the edge of the tide. As soon as I saw it, it was already gone. I grabbed the drawstring and slammed the curtains shut, my heart hammering against my ribs.

*""Bedtime,""* I said, my voice shaking. *""Now""*

**4 - Lullaby**

I woke up feeling lighter than I had in years. I had the most incredible dream, a long, melodic sequence that felt like a tale of love and embrace sewn into a beautiful symphony. I couldn't recall the specific lyrics or images, but the music lingered in the back of my mind. It was a beautiful love song, written in a strange, shimmering harmony that tasted like a major-augmented chord progression.

All the dread from the night before had evaporated. Standing in the morning light, I felt embarrassed by my own paranoia. Red coral? Reflective eyes in the dark? It all seemed like the fever dream of a man who’d had a bit too much Pinot Noir on an empty stomach. There was absolutely no reason to be afraid. Toby was waiting for me, looking calm and content. Surprisingly, the earplugs were still wedged in his ears. I took them out, laughing at how ridiculous he looked. *“Sorry about that, pal. I think I lost my mind for a minute there.”*

He didn't touch his kibble when I set it down, but I didn't let it bother me. He was probably just holding out for the good stuff. In my newfound good mood, I shared my breakfast eggs and bacon with him, and he took them gently, his tail wagging a slow, rhythmic beat. After I finished my coffee, I decided we needed to take advantage of the morning sun. I felt a bit silly reaching for the leash, given how peaceful everything felt, but I clipped it on anyway, just to be certain. If yesterday taught me anything, it was that Toby could be unpredictable when he caught the scent of a seagull. We stepped out into the crisp air, the song from my dream still humming in my chest, and headed down toward the water.

As we walked along the shoreline, a wave of profound, unknown nostalgia washed over me. It was a heavy, sweet pull in my chest, and for a second, I thought I heard it again that shimmering melody from my dream, drifting over the sound of the crashing surf. It felt like a memory I hadn't lived yet, calling me forward. I didn't even realize I’d moved until the sudden, biting cold of the ocean shocked my skin. I was standing ankle-deep in the foam, the hem of my jeans soaking through. The chill snapped me out of the daydream instantly. I looked down, bewildered, as the water receded, pulling the sand out from under my boots. Toby was standing right at the edge of the water, dead quiet, watching the depths with an intensity that made the hair on my neck prickle.

*""Come on, Toby,""* I said, tugging the leash. *""Too cold for a swim today.""*

I turned us back toward the house. I wasn't going to let a bit of cold water or a lingering dream rattle me. The stress of the drive, the weirdness at the grocery store, and all those local superstitions were in the rearview mirror now. I had a solid house, a happy dog, and a beautiful view.

The thought of leaving tomorrow settled into my mind like a quiet agreement. It wasn't an escape anymore, just a natural conclusion to a quick trip. Knowing the end was in sight allowed me to fully relax. In fact, as the sun climbed higher, I had this overwhelming, unshakable feeling that today was going to be one of the best days of my life. I sat on the deck, the wood warm beneath my feet, watching the light dance off the ocean. The water didn't look dark or menacing anymore, it looked like liquid silver. The air felt charged with a strange, electric kind of joy that made every breath feel effortless. Even the sound of the waves seemed to be syncing up with that faint, beautiful melody that was still stuck in my head.

Toby lay at my feet, chin resting on his paws, seemingly at peace. I reached down to scratch his head, feeling the salt in his fur, and smiled. Whatever had been bothering us, the nerves, the accidents, the strange red shapes, it all felt like a lifetime ago. The world felt perfectly aligned, as if the coast and the house and the water were all waiting for something wonderful to happen.

**5 - The Call**

I continued the morning with a book I’d pulled from my bag, *The Setting Sun* by Osamu Dazai. Usually, his work is a heavy burden to carry. It’s a bleak, crumbling world of aristocratic decline and lost souls. But as I sat in the sun-drenched living room, the typical weight of his prose didn't land. I skimmed past the despair and the talk of ruin, my eyes only catching the small, flickering moments of hopeful undertones, of a lost woman finding her way in a new world.

Normally, a book like that would leave me in a reflective, somber mood for hours, overanalyzing my own life choices. Today, I just focused on the hope. It felt like a sign. If Dazai’s characters could find a reason to keep going in their ruined world, then my own gloomy outlook back in the city was just a temporary shadow. I set the book down on the coffee table and looked out at the water. The setting sun was still hours away, and I felt like I was finally waking up to a life that actually mattered. That was when I reached for the guitar case. The bleakness was for someone else. Today, I only had room for the music.

The afternoon was a blur of pure, unadulterated joy. I took my guitar out of its case, the wood feeling warm and familiar in my hands. I started to jam, my fingers searching the fretboard until they stumbled upon the chord progression from my dream. It was a strange, haunting sequence, rich with notes that seemed to vibrate right through the floorboards.

I started humming the melody, and the effect on Toby was instantaneous. He didn't just wag his tail, he got frantically excited, pacing the living room before letting out a long, soulful howl that stayed perfectly in key with the guitar. I leaned into it, playing harder, the music filling every corner of the cedar house. Toby was spinning, his howls rising and falling with the chords, his eyes bright with a wild, infectious energy. It was easily one of the most fun and beautiful things I’d ever experienced. For a man whose life usually felt a bit too gloomy and far too bleak, this moment was an anchor. It felt like an endless dream, a private concert for two in a world that had finally stopped making demands.

The sun began to dip, casting long, golden bars across the oak floor, but I didn't stop playing. The more I hummed that love song, the more the house seemed to hum back. It felt like the walls, the sand, and even the distant waves were all part of the same perfect arrangement. I didn't realize how much time had slipped away until the golden light on the floor turned to a deep, dark purple. The trance finally broke, and I looked down at my fingers, which were sore and red from hours of pressing against the strings. The house was dark now, save for the single lamp over the stove, but the melody still felt like it was vibrating in the air around us.

I realized with a start that I hadn't eaten a thing all day. Neither had Toby, yet he didn't seem to mind. He was sitting by the window, his tail giving a slow, rhythmic thump-thump-thump against the oak.

*""Hungry, pal?""* I asked. My voice sounded raspy, like I’d been talking for hours. *""Let's make this one count.""*

I bypassed the bag of kibble entirely. If we were leaving tomorrow, I wasn't going to let the good stuff go to waste. I pulled the last of the prime steaks from the fridge, along with some butter and garlic. I cooked a dinner that would have surpassed most people's last meals, thick, seared cuts of beef that filled the kitchen with a rich, heavy aroma. I set a plate down for Toby and one for myself. We ate in a comfortable, light silence. There was no TV, no YouTube videos, and no wine tonight. I didn't need the alcohol to feel good anymore. The food was perfect, the house was warm, and the dread that had gripped me in town felt like a story I’d heard about someone else. Toby licked his plate clean, then looked up at me with a soft, satisfied expression. He looked peaceful. He looked like he was exactly where he was meant to be.

The day had finally wound down, and a heavy, quiet understanding settled between us. Even the best day of your life has to end eventually. Without a word, I turned off the kitchen lamp and we walked into the bedroom together. Toby didn’t wait for an invitation. He grabbed his blanket from the floor, dragged it over to the side of the bed, and managed to hoist himself up. Usually, I’d have made him stay in his own spot, but tonight, I didn't mind. I wanted the company. I felt a deep, soul-level exhaustion, the kind that comes after a day of pure, unfiltered joy.

I climbed under the covers, the rhythmic sound of the tide outside acting as a lullaby. Toby curled into a tight ball against my legs, his breathing slow and steady. My mind was already drifting back toward that major melody, the love song that felt like it was woven into the very fabric of the coast.

It wasn't until I was on the jagged edge of sleep that a cold realization pierced through my mind. My heart didn't race, at least not yet, but a faint alarm bell rang in the back of my skull.

I had left the earplugs on the kitchen counter.

I looked at Toby’s sleeping form in the moonlight. His ears were exposed, twitching slightly in his sleep as if they were already catching a signal from the dark. I thought about getting up, but the bed was so warm, and the dream was already pulling me back under. It was my biggest mistake, the kind you don't realize you've made until the consequences are already standing at the door.

The melody followed me into sleep, but the harmony had soured. The major lift was gone, replaced by a dissonant, crushing sorrow. It wasn't a love song anymore. It was a dirge of ancient pain and absolute misery. The warmth I’d felt all day was a farce, a hollow ruse designed to lower my guard.

I didn't wake up in the bedroom. I woke up to a sharp, biting cold that felt like needles in my skin. I was knee-deep in the black ocean, the water swirling violently around my legs. For a moment, I just stared at the foam, my mind refusing to process how I’d walked out of the house, across the sand, and into the water without ever opening my eyes.

Then reality hit. *""Toby?""* I whispered, then I screamed, *""Toby!""*

There was no response, only the rhythmic, mocking roar of the tide. I spun around, searching the dark until I saw a chestnut-brown shape bobbing in the distance. Toby was swimming straight out into the abyss. I could hear the song again, not in my head, but drifting off the water, a sorrowful, echoing version of my own voice singing that miserable melody.

*""Toby, come back!""* I screamed, my voice cracking against the wind. I waded deeper, the water rising to my waist.

*""Toby, stop!""* He seemed to hesitate. He was still dragging his favorite blanket in his teeth, the heavy fabric sodden with salt water and pulling him under.

*""Let go of the blanket!""* I sobbed, tears blurring my vision as I fought the current. *""Come back, Toby! Please! Don't leave me!""*

At the sound of my final, desperate shriek, Toby seemed to snap out of the trance. He turned, his eyes locking onto mine, and began to paddle frantically toward the shore. For a second, a spark of hope flared in my chest. He was coming back.

Then, the water behind him erupted.

Massive, blood red shapes, stiff and jagged like antlers of blood-colored coral shot out of the depths.

With one lightning-fast, silent swoop, they hooked into the water.

Toby didn't even have time to yelp. He was simply dragged down, disappearing beneath the surface in a swirl of white foam and his floating, discarded blanket.

*""TOBY!""* I lunged forward, diving into the freezing dark, reaching for anything, but there was nothing but the cold, empty weight of the sea.

The rest is a blur. I remember the sun eventually rising, a cruel, bright eye over a calm horizon. I remember standing on the shore, shivering uncontrollably, my clothes plastered to my skin with salt and sand. That final look of despair in Toby’s eyes as he was taken, that silent plea, was etched into my mind, engraved into my heart.

I looked at the house, then back at the flat, indifferent water. The song was gone. The hope was gone. There was nothing left for me.",2,1770483460.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

We met a few weeks to a month ago and have been talking and texting pretty much weekly. The connection was super strong and I have a major crush on him! So we met up a few weeks ago and got a drink but it was a really short meetup and no kiss happened. That was fine because we literally had just met and were feeling it out. Well last night we met up for our second meetup. It was a coffee and park date. We each got a coffee and parked at the park and talked for a few hours. it was going VERY well. So much chemistry! The end of the night came and we hugged goodbye and he asked if he could kiss me. I said yes. Well this is where the wheels fell off. He came in HARD, CHAOTIC, and AGGRESSIVE with this kiss. That is definitely not my style! I prefer soft, slow, sensual, especially to start and on a technically first date (I'm not even really sure now what it was). I tried to guide him and match his style but it just wasnt coming together. So he pulled away and then came back in. It was equally as awkward. He was like on top of me going in for it! I was so thrown off and my mouth was so dry from the coffee and not having any water and he also kind of sat back in his seat and gave me a look and commented on that. It got SO awkward. And so i left and went home, he did not text me after, and today is the next day and still nothing. I like him so much so I would be willing to work on the kissing but I just dont know how hes feeling! Do you think he could tell it was bad? Am I cooked? Is he embarrassed and just preserving his ego? Should I text him? Ahhhhh i like him so much!!!!! I wish it hadnt been so awkward!!!!!! His kissing style is absolutely chaotic and he like vacuumed my mouth! I need to save this!!!!

(To preface this, I know I am the biggest IDIOT of all time)

Picked up a 2018 RRS Autobiography LAST NIGHT. Car worked perfect, everything. This morning, went to grab the family coffees, and spilled a splash of coffee on the center console. By an act of god, it splashed directly into the two USB ports. Neither port works now via wired cord. Anyone have ideas how to fix or part numbers to replace this specific piece? It looks like there’s dried coffee inside the connections that can be wiped away, just not sure how to approach this…

TL;DR I got coffee into the USB CarPlay port and now I have no connection to my phone. Need ideas to fix and/or part numbers to replace. ",2,1770483210.0,RangeRover,2,1.0,False

Background:
I have diagnosed ADHD and am prescribed Adderall XR - use as needed. I don't normally use it much at all only when I have to get out of an ADHD funk which I was in. Happens every winter. 

Normally I drink 16-18oz of black coffee per day which is possibly why I don't need my ADHD meds regularly. 

3 young kiddos so we've been in a common sleep debt for the last 9 years with night wakings, etc. 

This week:
On Weds I decided to take my Adderall which means I won't take it with coffee because they don't work together. Took meds Weds, Thurs, and Friday - my outlook inbox is manageable and I got my structure back in place. 

During this time I've had splitting headaches, high levels of anxiety at night and terrible sleep - which sounds like the caffeine withdrawal

Today:
No Adderall and no caffeine. It's the weekend - why not!? Morning has been rough but had lunch and I actually feel great. No increased sense of urgency, I'm calmer with the kids, and actually making good diet choices. 

Future:
I'm calling it quits. No more caffeine. I may very well not take Adderall either because maybe my lack of focus and impulsivity is caused by my caffeine usage/sleep debt cycle. 

Goal:
I want to be a calmer parent, better husband and more strategic at work with my goals. 

I hope that these decisions will set me up for success and lift this foggy caffeine world I've been in for all of adulthood.

BAPE Bapesta Sneakers

Stiff sole, zero flex. Looks clean in pics, hurts by the second block. That star logo? Only cool if you’re not walking far.



Nike Dunk Low Sneakers

Blue Swoosh shifts in sunlight. Tongue slides sideways instantly. Still looks great with black jeans — just don’t plan a hike.



Nike Dunk Low Sneakers

Rope laces stay tied. Bandana fabric stains if you touch anything damp. Reverse Swoosh feels like a hidden win. Love it, but it’s high-maintenance.



Nike Air Jordan 4 Sneakers

Grey leather hides scuffs. Mesh breathes even in humidity. Plastic wings don’t squeak. The only pair I grabbed three days straight.



Nike Air Max 90 Sneakers

Thin sole = every crack punches your heel. Mint green looks fresh, but one raindrop ruins the vibe. Too fragile for real life.



Nike Air Jordan 1

1qyitif,https://www.reddit.com/r/solopassions/comments/1qyitif/my_first_solo_trip_to_eastern_europe_was_rougher/,"My first solo trip to Eastern Europe was rougher than I expected, but I learned SO much (Found incredible local markets for under $5 a meal) 🌍","When I pictured my first solo trip to Eastern Europe, I probably had a bit too much Instagram-filtered wanderlust in my head. I imagined effortlessly gliding through cobbled streets, perfectly posed with a croissant. The reality? A lot more sweaty navigation, missed train connections, and ""Am I actually going the right way?"" moments. But, boy, did I learn a ton – and stumble upon the most incredible local markets where a truly satisfying meal cost me less than my morning coffee back home.

If you're thinking about tackling your first solo adventure, especially somewhere a little less ""mainstream"" than Western Europe, here's the unvarnished truth from my recent venture:

*   **My Rough-Around-the-Edges Route & Timing:**
    *   **3 weeks total:** Flew into **Krakow, Poland** for a week, then a train to **Budapest, Hungary** for another week, and finally a bus to **Prague, Czech Republic** for the last week.
    *   **Accommodation:** Mostly **hostels** (average ~$20-30/night for a dorm bed). I splashed out on a private room for a couple of nights in Budapest when I needed a mental reset.
    *   **Transport:** Inter-city trains were great in Poland, but I switched to **FlixBus/RegioJet** for Hungary/Czechia to save money. Booking tickets online a week or two ahead usually got me the best prices.

*   **The Food Hack That Saved My Budget (and My Soul): Local Markets**
    *   This was my absolute salvation. Forget tourist-trap restaurants; the markets were where the real magic (and value) happened.
    *   **Krakow:** **Stary Kleparz market**. My go-to for breakfast and lunch. Incredible, fresh pierogi, kielbasa, and smoked cheese. A huge, delicious plate was often **15-20 PLN (around $4-5 USD)**.
    *   **Budapest:** **Central Market Hall (Nagyvásárcsarnok)**. Head upstairs for an array of prepared foods. I lived on Langos (fried dough with sour cream and cheese) for about **1000-1500 HUF ($3-4)**. You could even get a hearty goulash in a bread bowl for ~$5-6.
    *   **Prague:** **Havelské tržiště (Havel's Market)** and various smaller street stalls near Národní třída. While Trdelník (sweet pastry) is popular (~$3), I found fantastic grilled sausages, potato pancakes, and savory crepes for similarly low prices.
    *   **How I found them:** Asked hostel staff, looked for ""trh"" (Czech for market), ""targ"" (Polish), or ""piac"" (Hungarian) on Google Maps, and honestly, just followed my nose and the local foot traffic.
    *   **Average daily food budget:** I easily kept it to **~$15-20 a day** by leaning heavily on these markets for at least two meals.

*   **The ""Rougher"" Part (and What I Learned):**
    *   **Language barriers are real:** Outside major tourist areas, English isn't always common. Google Translate's offline packs and a few basic local phrases became essential. It taught me patience and how to communicate beyond words.
    *   **Solo navigation blues:** There were moments of genuine frustration trying to figure out confusing bus routes or walking in circles. It can be lonely, even in a bustling city, when you can't easily vent to a travel buddy. *Lesson: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Take a breath, grab a coffee, and try again.*
    *   **Unexpected hiccups are inevitable:** A delayed overnight train in Poland meant I missed a pre-booked walking tour in Budapest. Annoying, but not the end of the world. *Lesson: Build buffer time into your itinerary and don't over-schedule. Flexibility is your friend.*
    *   **Trust your gut:** There were a couple of instances where a situation felt off, and I learned to listen to that feeling and remove myself. *Lesson: Your safety is paramount. Be aware, but don't let fear dictate your experience.*
    *   **The power of a smile:** Despite language barriers, a genuine smile and an attempt at local greetings often opened doors (or at least got me a very patient shopkeeper). *Lesson: Connect with people, even briefly. It makes the trip richer.*
    *   **Solo isn't always glamorous:** There were days I just wanted to chill in the hostel, read a book, and not ""do"" anything. *Lesson: It's not a performance. It's your trip, your pace. Rest when you need to.*

My first solo trip to Eastern Europe pushed me out of my comfort zone daily, sometimes uncomfortably so. But the payoff in personal growth, resourcefulness, and those simple, honest moments – like devouring a $4 plate of pierogi in a bustling local market – was absolutely worth every single one of those ""rougher than expected"" bumps.

the copy that got us there was stupidly short like 29 words total

The Copy:

Hey, What if you could pull unlimited lead lists for less than your coffee budget?

Want a quick sneak peek?

P.S. We onboarded Cold IQ, Scale Topia, Outbound Consulting

Thats it and no feature breakdown and no ""our revolutionary platform""

Just a question and a soft CTA

Why this worked

1. Brevity actually is the soul of wit

Shakespeare said it and cold email proves it. I tested 70 words copy, 100 word, 150 word copy but this 29 word version crushed all of them

and the reason is because people dont have time they are literally just scanning and if you cant say it in under 30 words then you are asking them to invest attention you havent earned yet

2) dont give everything away in email 1

the instinct is to explain your whole offer so they understand it but thats backwards in reality the job of the first email is just to spark curiosity and get a reply and if you tell them everything upfront theres nothing left to talk about

""unlimited lead lists for less than coffee budget"" hints at value without explaining the whole system and they have to reply to learn more thats the point

3) keep the CTA stupid light

didnt ask for a call, didnt ask for 15 minutes because asking for too much upfront kills momentum

just sent""want a quick sneak peek?"" because the lower the commitment the easier it is to say yes and you can always escalate to a call after they reply and show interest

4) name drop your best customers

adding Cold IQ, Scale Topia and Outbound Consulting in the PS made a huge difference. as these are names people in the cold email space recognize and if they know them then thats instant credibility

even if you dont have big names yet offer something free like an audit and give them a reason to reply beyond just curiosity

The real lesson is that most people overthink email #1. They try to explain everything, overcome objections and establish credibility

Just make them curious enough to reply thats it

Once they engage then you share more because email #1 is just about getting them to raise their hand

I’m trying to systematically explore the best food the city has to offer across all types of cuisine.

I eat everything. Casual, hole-in-the-wall, fine dining, bakeries, regional specialties etc. I feel like I have more recommendations so far around fine dining (open to more) but would really love to find some more hole-in-the-wall type places with authentic food and great value as well.

Happy to spend/travel if needed but all that matters is good food!

I’m especially looking to find good spots for things I have been either been struggling to find good for (like certain types of Asian cuisine) or cuisines I just haven't explored properly (African, Indian etc). Here is where I would love to get recos:

* Thai
* Korean (Korean BBQ, Korean fried chicken)
* Japanese (dipping noodles, tonkatsu, Japanese curry)
* Chinese (Sichuan, dim sum, hand-pulled noodles, regional Chinese)
* Indian (North Indian, South Indian/dosa, Pakistani BBQ)
* Vietnamese (pho and banh mi spots)
* Ethiopian / East African
* West African
* Caribbean
* Authentic Mexican
* Spanish / Tapas
* Afghan / Persian
* Proper BBQ / smoked meats
* Open to any and all recos but missing ideas from the above!

Below is what I’ve tried and liked so far (grouped by cuisine) and hopefully it might give some good inspiration for new spots to try for other people! Asked ChatGPT to group them for simplicity before people start coming at me about categories hahah.

1qyis9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1qyis9y/should_i_leave_or_wait_it_out_29f/,Should I leave? Or wait it out? [29F],"So recently my fiance \[29M\] and I \[29F\] having been having some issues in out relationship. At this point it almost feels cyclic because we had plenty of ups and downs. Recently he's become more aggressive and treats me terribly. He's yelled at me, throwing things around the house or stonewalling me and pretends I dont exist. This behavior is unacceptable and has only been occurring for 3 weeks weeks. I found out earlier this week he had been skipping his adhd medication due to a work trip coming up and that is also a massive part of the out of the blue aggression. We both have anger issues but this has gotten to far and he hasn't allowed for us the opportunity to sit down and talk calmly about everything because he's still not himself. Back tracking a little bit he has adhd (possibly autistic) and I am waiting to be diagnosed with adhd(possibly bipolar- my personal opinion). We both have mental health meds bc we decided if we were going to grow together we also needed to help ourselves and do our best to be as healthy as we can be. There have been multiple factors that could explain his recent behavior but he's also crossed the line into abuse territory and that is where b I have to put my foot down. So it started with an everyday conversation about what we wanted to cook for the day and  I made a defensive statement like ""No I dont"" in regards to him stating I needed to stop using so much of a spice that I have actually used in a month. Well that caused the first explosion. He got mad stopped talking right then and there and stonewalled me for the rest of the day. Then the next morning I woke up after he did and I forgot to get something out of his car for him ( he is also a disabled vet.) bc I was waiting on my coffee( that I also forgot about twice bc phone squirrels/sleepy haze) so as I waiting on coffee so I could actually be awake and present he stormed out the door to his car, he slammed the door,I yelled his name bc I had just processed he wasnt in the house and was infact getting the item out of his car. I also need to note that I am very emotional and reactive. So after he came inside he yelled at me bc I forgot about getting the item and was unaware that 45 minutes had passed. At that point I decide to go back to bed( mad, annoyed, sleepy and frustrated ) and I did slam the bed room door. He than proceeded to throw and break things etc. After things calmed down we talked. Well he talked. He talked all about how I dont listen to him or pay attention and how everything I say never makes any sense. That his piss off was entirely my fault. I told him to schedule couples counseling for communication issues. I tried to tell him we needed to focus on resolving these issues, like if I am focused and in the middle of doing something I know I'm not gonna here him unelss Im paying attention. Or if I'm half asleep and still processing the living world. Throwing things and Stonewalling set me off. We both have our own traumas and things but I couldn't get any other words out before I was to blame. Moving forward to this week he set himself off whilst cooking, I was outside and didn't have my phone, I came inside to the kitchen absolutely destroyed. He was in the middle of throwing things out of the cabinets and breaking things all because he couldn't find a blender top. I came inside asked what he was looking for ,went to get it for him and I did yell at him to stop breaking things bc I spend on average cleaning 4 hours a day just to keep up the house. This was my breaking point. I haven't spoken to him since. I go home I go to bed. I want to talk to him and discuss with him that if this is what our future looks like I dont have a choice but to leave. But if he takes his medication, goes to therapy and anger management,  I will walk by his side until he gets through it. This is the person I chose to marry so should I give him a chance to make it right or should I leave? or am I just being a unreasonable? ",2,1770483069.0,whatdoIdo,4,1.0,False

Thin sole = every crack punches your heel. Mint green looks fresh, but one raindrop ruins the vibe. Too fragile for real life.



Nike Air Jordan 1

Denim-like upper picks up lint and coffee splashes fast. Midsole yellowed in a week — but weirdly fits the worn-in look. Perfect for lazy days.

I was worried about it for two weeks and hour before took Xanax 1mg. Half an hour later I took another 1 mg. During the day I didnt eat much - crepe with Nutella and fruits in the morning and sandwich in the middle of the day+I had two or three coffees.

I was a bit sleepy during the meeting but after it ended and I headed home I fell asleep on the subway. Some lady woke me up. When I got home I wanted to sleep so badly but was also hungry so ordered some food ate it and fell asleep. Had really weird dreams (nothing horrific). I woke up next day around 9am but I was so tired physically and dissapointed in myself (the meeting didnt went well, I mean it was better than I thought but still) and I felt like during hangover. After an hour or so I fell asleep again while scrolling on my phone and woke up at 6pm.

1qyipg4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qyipg4,How to lay out narrow living/dining room with shutters & fireplace on long walls?,"TLDR: I have a long, open concept living/dining room that I’ve been really stumped on how to lay out. With the shuttered windows on one long wall and the fireplace on the other, I’m not sure the best place to put the couch and tv/stand. 

Overall, I moved in a little under a year ago and this has been my first apartment with a full living room to decorate/furnish, so all furniture was purchased from Facebook marketplace (except the storage side table which I’ve had for years). Since I had to furnish the place relatively quickly (boyfriend didn’t wanna wait months for me to find the perfect second hand items, understandably), I mostly tried to get functional pieces that work relatively well together aesthetically. I’m mostly looking for advice on how to make such a narrow living room feel less awkward, and I’m open to suggestions on future furniture swaps. 

I think it makes the most sense to keep the dining area where I have it, as the small alcove it sits in wouldn’t realistically fit much else. I think it would be nice to switch the table out for a smaller table in the future, but I enjoy the warm wood tone so that’s not a top priority for me. 

The toughest constraints of this room come from the fireplace and windows. The mantle over the fireplace is around eye level, so I think putting a TV above it would be uncomfortable to watch. All windows in the room have interior shutters that can be opened completely like a door (like the ones pictured next to the dining table). This requires around 2’ clearance between the windows and any furniture to maintain the ability to open windows. Ideally, I want to maintain the ability to open all windows in this space, as the abundant natural light was the main reason I chose this apartment. I’d consider removing functionality of up to 2 window shutters for a major improvement in room flow. 

I feel like it is weird to have a long tv stand next to the fireplace, as this kind of creates two “focal points” in the room. However, as said above, I don’t think it would work to mount the TV above the fireplace due to height. I’ve considered moving the couch to the wall next to the fireplace (where the TV stand is now) & replacing the TV stand with a narrower easel-type stand placed in the small section of blank wall between the dining room & living room windows. The issue with this idea is that it may feel equally weird/weirder to have a long couch placed next to the fireplace, as I’ve never really seen that done before in a living room. Additionally, having the couch next to the fireplace would block the existing straight walkway from the front door to bedroom door, and require the path through the apartment to be less clear. 

The other major issue I have with our couch & TV stand placement is that I don’t see an open area anywhere to create any type of “conversation circle”. I really like when living rooms have a couple chairs facing the couch to create a cozier space, but the only place I see that could possibly accommodate a chair facing the couch would be directly in front of the bedroom door, which would again block the straight path from the front door to the bedroom door.  

I plan to get a side table for the other end of the couch and likely a smaller (probably oval) coffee table as my likely next improvements. Eventually, I would also like to swap the couch for one of the types with just an extra section you can scoot up to any seat to create a footrest/sectional feel without having it attach to one specific place. Please let me know if you’ve got any advice on how to improve this layout to more clearly make a living room “zone” that feels less awkward. ",2,1770482883.0,DesignMyRoom,1,1.0,False

I've done everything else including roasting my own coffee for the past dozen years. This past year in 2025 I have done the following things to give me a better cup. Upgraded my Encore ESP that I still use for large batches of brew to buying a Ezpresso K Ultra and ZP6, lots of different brewers, water quality with 2 tabletop water filters. The only thing I have not bought into are the paper filters. I use the basic v60 hario and the melitta for my different brewers and the inexpensive ones for the Kalita and Oragami type brewers that are flat bottom. 

In can brew on all my brewers using 12-30 grams with the Ezpresso grinders in 2-2:30 minutes if I want a faster brew time using the melodrip or stretch out the times to 3:00-3:30 using the pour over kettle. 

My grind size with my ZP6 is set to 4 and my K-Ultra at 6.5. So its plenty fine and I get no clogging issues with using the melodrip. 

So since time is not a factor I cannot see any reason to buy the ""expensive"" filters since I'm very happy with the results and taste. If they are rinsed well before using I don't see taste being an issue. 

I do not believe expensive filters will change the taste in the cup. Am I wrong ? ",1,1770482813.0,pourover,13,1.0,False

My wife is from Ontario and we live here in Ireland.

The one thing she misses most of all from Canada are Coffee Crisp candy bars. Having tried them when some of her friends brought them along on a visit, I can fully understand why she misses them. They are delicious.

We haven't been able to find them in any shops here. We did recently come across them on a recent city break in Glasgow. One of those Money Laundering US Candy Shops stocked them. None of the similar shops we have tried here in our area have them.

Has anyone found a shop local to them which stock them? I think she would happily drive anywhere on the island to stock up on them.",0,1770482708.0,AskIreland,16,0.36,False

1qyim62,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1qyim62/aio_48m_boyfriend_decided_he_wants_more_kids/,AIO 48M boyfriend decided he wants more kids,"TL;DR; : my (43F) boyfriend (48M) of 3 yrs. thinks he might want more kids. I’m not able to have kids. Seeking advice on how to navigate the events. 

My 43F boyfriend 48M offered to get a vasectomy after I had a very difficult 5-week long miscarriage. He said he didn’t want it to happen again. It messed me up really bad, he didn’t support me in mourning and acts like it didn’t happen. It’s still sad for me and I still have trauma from the experience. I want to talk w/ him about how I’m still mourning but I’m afraid he will blow up. 

Every year on the day the miscarriage happened is difficult and the due date is still sad for me too (it was a Christmas due date baby). The miscarriage was 1.5 years ago and he and I have been together for 3 years. 

I was 29 years old when I found out I couldn’t have kids. It was difficult news and messed me up pretty bad for a long time. I have severe pcos and didn’t think I could even get pregnant, and am not able to carry a full term pregnancy if I do. 

We discussed kids when we first met before things got serious. He has a teenage son from a previous relationship that has some pretty severe physical disabilities that required a lot of serious surgeries. His son is in a stable condition now and doing well with his health. In our talk he was adamant about not wanting more kids. This was okay with me since I’m not able to have kids at all. I have had one very close long term friendship with a man that wanted kids and things had to end because I couldn’t give that to him and it was very sad. I firmly will not date a man that needs to have options open to have kids in the future because it’s not an option for me. I fully explained that I can’t have a full term pregnancy so that there was no question about that possibility. I love kids (I come from a big family) and am perfectly okay with a man already having kids but I can’t create new ones. 

It’s been almost two years since he offered to get the procedure and he finally went to the consultation a couple days ago. We talked on the phone after the consult. He said it was a quick 15 minute procedure but the doctor told him that it’s basically irreversible. Asked him how he felt about it and he said that he didn’t like that it wasn’t reversible in case he wanted to have kids. I explained that it would be with someone else not me since I can’t. He said he was feeling conflicted about putting an end to his bloodline. I asked him if he wanted to break up so that he could meet someone else to potentially continue his bloodline with. He lost it started yelling at me saying I was being vindictive that he was being honest and that I was throwing it in his face. This wasn’t easy for me I told him, but that we need to talk about the relationship if his feelings of having kids have changed. He yelled at me some more and hung up on me. He refused to finish the conversation. 

I texted him asking if we could please talk about it, that it was an important conversation and that we need to talk about what this means for our relationship. He said he didn’t want to talk about it. That I was treating him like a dirt bag for saying he wants kids. That he needs to think about a permanent decision like this one (I agree and think that’s fair). He said that maybe ‘we’ might want to have a pregnancy with a surrogate in 10 years. He failed to point out that I will be 53 years old in 10 years and he will be 58 years old. 

I replied saying that he’s not a dirt bag for wanting kids, but that we need to be honest about what it means and what it doesn’t. 

We have never discussed having a baby we aren’t married and he doesn’t believe in marriage. We don’t live together and he has not expressed an intention of wanting to live with me. He only allows me to visit with him on weekends. He makes zero attempt to see me on the weekdays and shows zero interest in seeing me more than on the weekends. No dinners, movies, not even a meet up for a coffee. I have a small chunk of time allotted to me. It’s basically just Saturday and until I go home on Sunday. It’s been like this for 3 years. It’s like having a non-custodial parent all over again. We don’t have a close relationship that I want with a partner. I struggle with this because i firmly believe in commitment. I don’t know what part of those components make him think I would consent to having a baby when we haven’t discussed it. He still hasn’t even asked me if I wanted to. I don’t want a surrogacy in two years. I don’t want a surrogacy in five years and I especially don’t want a surrogacy in 10 years. I don’t have the resources or the support system to have a baby at all and he is not a supportive partner. It would be very bad for me and a baby with the current relationship system he has going on. 

I texted him yesterday asking if we could talk about it soon and he said no he doesn’t want to talk about it yet. 

I’m not clear on what his decision is because he won’t talk about it at all. I don’t want to think the worst, but I don’t see him going forward with the procedure with the feelings he has shared up to this point. It’s my feeling that he’s had a change of heart and wants his options open to have kids in the future. Obviously he’s allowed to want more kids, and although sad for me after all of the ups and downs our relationship has endured, I would accept his decision and respect his wishes. I don’t plan to manipulate or guilt him into going against what he wants in his heart. Makes me very sad to think about it because I know it won’t be with me and I love him deeply. To lose him over this is devastating just thinking about it being a possibility. It would be the second relationship I will have lost over infertility. Surrogacy and having a baby are not an option for me or for this relationship. We haven’t had the final conversation so am not sure what he will say. If he tells me he wants to have the option to have more kids, I would need to end the relationship. If that’s his decision then it’s putting an indefinite end date on the relationship and to stay any longer will only cause me unnecessary pain and more loss when he decides it’s time to get someone pregnant. I just can’t see a point in hanging on to something that is dead in the water. 

He invited me to come over today but I’m not comfortable seeing him again until he’s willing to talk about it with me so we can put it behind us (regardless of the outcome). I want to tell him this in simple language but I’m afraid he will flip out again. He acts like I don’t have feelings. Like I would not be sacrificing myself to respect his wishes if he says he wants kids in the future. Like he’s the only one that feels hurt in this situation. 

He has a history of freezing me out when we are faced with a difficult conversation. 

My questions to you are: 

1. Would it be fair for me to explain that I want to see him but that I think it’s best for us not to see each other until he’s willing to talk to me about this so that we can put it behind us (regardless of the outcome)?

2. How should I respond if he shares that he doesn’t want to do the procedure so that he has the option to have a pregnancy in the future? 

3. Would I be overreacting to leave the relationship to spare my emotions and to give him the freedom to decide if he wants to find someone else to have kids with?

As I am writing this, I am listening to some light piano music and one thing is sticking in my mind that has to be approached very seriously when we are in the transition from alcoholics to sober ...  The one thing that is scarier than any DT, the only thing that hunts us every day ... LONELINESS...  Through these 190 days of sobriety I have battled depression and I won , I have battle also food addiction I have won , battled alcohol cravings 190 days succesfull battle, I run almost every day made sport part of my new identity - won , but there is one thing that keeps me haunted like a cloud above myself is the sheer loneliness that no one understands how hard is to live with this monster once have entered our lives... Starting from family members saying that we dont have problems, its just a phase, to going in the outside world on a coffee with friends with all the mess in our heads - that urge to tell them how hard is for us and on the other side is the fear of being judged in other words isolated ... Its a damn creepy place to be in, I mean I am calculating my successes, it is wonderful to be honest, but that lonely feeling that I am alone in this battle, that I have no one to celebrate lets say the first 30 days with no one, just myself , laying in the bed listening to some songs that use to make me happy in a dark cold room its the reality of our path ... Just imagine saying to a friend I am celebrating not drinking for 30 days, the sheer shame, the mixed emotions of fear of being judged, fear of being thrown away as someone who has a problem and in the same time the peace we have in our hearts that we are on the right path, we are fighting to stay sober, we are building our lives back, and all that we are doing it alone, maybe someone here and there will understand us, but in the end when we are laying down on our pillow and bed we are all alone with the thoughts we have in our heads of how we got here ? with whom to share ? should we share ? are we are going to be treated the same ? feeling like a helpless child, waiting a warm hug for god sake someone to say it is ok you made a mistake, its not the end, you are alive you function you are going to build the life you wanted, you are worth , we accept as you are and we are here to be your support --> THAT is the number one thing we need in this fight ... And that is why I want thank all of the people here ... I am changing my life, completely turned it around , but I know people that are struggling , keep pushing guys believe me someone in the future is waiting to read you BOOK OF LIFE , and they will enjoy reading it just as we once enjoyed life when we were young and wild , believing in some other world that never existed ...

1qyilgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1qyilgw/231_days_sober_i_just_lost_3_friends_to_this/,231 days sober. I just lost 3 friends to this disease in the last 24 hours. Still IWNDWYT.,"I'm honestly numb right now and still trying to process this.

Like the title says, I lost 3 friends I met in recovery within the last 24 hours.

One, from IOP, relapsed and drove drunk early in the morning and drove down the highway on the wrong side causing a head-on on collision. He died instantly. The other driver was seriously injured, but at least they're alive. This one makes me mad as well as sad. I should have called him when he didn't show up to Weekly group. I'm pissed at him and myself. And I'm pissed at myself for being pissed. He was funny and kind and the least judgemental guy I've ever met. It's difficult sometimes to connect with straight men for me, but it was instant friendship with him.

Another friend, whom I also met in IOP, had been an alcoholic for about 25 years. She sought recovery because her heart was struggling to keep up with her lifestyle. She managed a non-profit and her own farm where she rehabilitated sick and injured animals. We bonded over our love of animals and dorky things and our hyperfixations. She had a heart attack.

The last friend, which hit the hardest to be honest, I had met while inpatient at the beginning of summer. She had been an alcoholic for about 20 years. Her heart also was not great. She told me her heart was at 30% function when we met. 

We were eachother's confidents while in residential treatment. We had so much fun when we could in there, had breakfast, lunch, and dinner together every day. We FaceTimed and called a ton when I got out and then she went to sober living. We lived about 2 hours away from each other. When she relapsed in October, I spent 8 hours on the phone with her that night after she had gone to a meeting, just talking about anything and everything, how were going to be getting better for ourselves. How we're learning who we are as individuals again. And laughing a hell of a lot.
She had a stroke in early December and was in cardiac rehab from then until the end of January. I went to visit her a lot. Brought her favorite snacks and dvds and books. Lamented over the rehab's terrible food, and I helped her get on health insurance. She got out of Cardiac Rehab on January 22 and was moving into a new apartment. We were going to have a sleepover once she was settled in.

She had another stroke alone in her apartment 2 days ago.

I guess I just wanted to share what happened to my friends and how much they mean to me. I knew being in the recovery community meant dealing with death on a more regular level. I have known people lost to addiction and the complications that go with it. But not actual close friends. And certainly not in such fast succession. It feels weird and surreal.

I'm trying to make sense of it. Part of my brain wants to use them as cautionary tales for myself obviously, but that also feels cold and strange. Like I don't want to ""use"" their memory, or my love for them. But I also don't really know how to accept this as pure happenstance. I know, logically, this can happen. But the likelihood of it happening feels almost impossible. Yet it did. It did happen. They're gone. I'll never be able to talk to them again, or hug them, or laugh about crap with them again. I'll never see their smiles again, or hear about their day, or the good and bad about what's going on with them. I won't get to tell them what's going on with me, or to meet up for breakfast or coffee again.

Life is messy and strange and heartbreaking.

Anyway, I guess I just wanted to share with you all. I'm going to try and take care of myself today. Probably go for a walk even though it's cold as Siberia outside. But, for certain, IWNDWYT.

My husband went to Starbucks to grab coffee for the two of us. I asked him to pick up a new loaf cake thing I have seen in the store recently. He gets home and hands me my items. As I open the food bag, I see half the loaf is gone. More specifically, the top portion that contains the little extra (ex: lemon loaf had the lemon cream on top).

I ask him why he ate it and he looks at me like I’m crazy and insists he didn’t eat any. I’m so frustrated because I was looking forward to trying this and he just ate it, then denied doing so straight to my face. I told him to forget it and I don’t want it anymore. Suddenly, I’m the bad guy for no longer wanting the food and he is upset with me now.

AIO or am I justified in having no interest in eating the scraps remaining in the bag?

EDIT:

A few people here seem to think I should have just accepted it and moved on. Yes, I can always get my own food.. that is not the point of this post. The point was, he did something deliberately to annoy me, then acted as though I was in the wrong for how it made me feel. As I mentioned in one of my responses, I am autistic. When things unexpectedly change, it fucks with me, hence my asking if I was overreacting.

Ultimately, we are fine. My husband realized how much it upset me and brought me a new one (untouched) just now that he picked up while out grabbing some items he needed to pick up.
