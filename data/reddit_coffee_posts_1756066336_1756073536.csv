I've never had any sort of romantic interactions. I feel like my only friend is my cat and all I do is hangout with my parents and mainly just stay at home, or go out with my parents to coffee shops, go food shopping etc. I feel too afraid and anxious to ever leave the house by myself or for long stretches of time. I feel so lonely and depressed and have been for many years now. I am on anti-depressants and have been having counselling sessions but nothing seems to help much. I feel a bit more numb than I did before, which I think is a bit better because I don't feel the pain and sadness of loneliness and depression as much. But I kind of just feel nothing at all. Nothing but emptiness and sadness. I feel like I'm at a time in my life where I should be having fun, partying, drinking, going out and going on holidays with my friends and instead I'm just doing nothing at all. I don't at all even know what I'm doing with my life and I just feel so miserable all the time. I've pretty much felt like this since I was 15. Has anyone been through anything similar and does it ever get better?",1,1756073345.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,0,1.0,False

I woke up with dirt under my fingernails again, but I swear it looked red-der than last time. Imagination is what I've told myself to keep the creeping anxiety at bay. The smell is atrocious, time for a quick shower, then work of course. Same old, same old. Another day, where I go to work, eat a lunch, finish work, and go home. Ready to do it all again the next day. Boring, but overall that’s my life and I’m not big on complaining. At least not about that anyway. Home again. I’m a wreck after work today, so I think it’s time for the best thing humans have ever made a totino's pizza, square, and it’s microwaved the way God intended! Not that I believe in the bastard but still, if it did, it would approve. I look down and say, ‘Hi, Mr. Peter Parker!’ to my little furry friend. He’s been with me since I was eighteen and moved here. If humans ignored me, Peter always saw me. Little guy always sits with me, he’s not super active, not in a, ‘Is your cat dead?’ type of way but closer to a, 'cute lazy way.' He’s just an old man that refuses to die. He doesn’t really make many, if any noises. He’s the perfect companion, we never forget each other.

Oh and his name came from the fact that if you put on Spider-Man 2, he absolutely will sit and watch the whole thing with you. He sleeps right next to me every night. No matter where I sleep he’s always next to me.

 

 “Sleep until better times.”



I found myself, still on the couch the next day, I must have dozed off. Where's Pete? Maybe he went to eat from his bowl but he usually licks my face in the morning to get me up.  It happened again, it's under my nails but I can't deny it any longer. The things under my nails are a sick mixture of skin, blood, and dirt. I always knew I was my worst enemy but Christ didn't think it was this bad! I don't feel any pain though, no scars either. No damage I can visually see. I seriously don't understand. Well this is actually fucking gross, gonna take a shower, then work of course. I guess. The amount of time it took to get all that out from under my nails was a pain. The texture alone is the stuff of nightmares. For an idea of what I went through, it felt like you're going ham on some ribs but you, for some reason, dug deep into the meat with a clawing motion with reckless abandon. Slammed some mac and cheese in there too but instead of wiping off your fingers or sucking them clean, you shoved all your fingers into some thick red pudding. The rest of my hands were relatively clean and I wasn’t covered in anything else either; I didn’t look like a serial killer, covered in my victims gutty works but under my nails, I had caused a massacre.  My boss saw me and said I looked taller. He stared at me a lot longer today too, like he saw something he liked, in a strange proud way. Weirdo. Went about my business. Today was a really different day. I cleaned what I needed and greeted who I needed to greet. One of my residents talked to me for what felt like hours. Was she flirting with me? Look I’m no incel or some strange person but I’m extremely forgettable. I was forgotten about on my 12th birthday by my own parents. Being a kid was fine enough, I was a late bloomer and didn't understand a big part of what made humans, human. The longing for a tribe and community never occurred to me as something I should want. Instead, I put my hand to the ground and would wait for the wiggling little bodies of ants to crawl onto it. They never did, they ignored my hand too. They ignored me like almost anything else that's alive does. Changing my perspective on it was all I could do. I had a super power, invisibility! I don’t mind it usually, I can ride the bus for free and get ignored by random Mormon missionaries on their little cute bikes. Never really was bothered that I was socially invisible, never caused a problem for me. Don’t get me wrong I still need human connection and I get it plenty, more than enough honestly. I decided that I’ll just work jobs where I can’t be ignored, so retail it is. I work in leasing in an office downtown, I’m up front, you can’t ignore me here, most of the time. Point is, a woman who was maybe in her late forties who has never acknowledged my existence in my five years here started talking to me. To be honest I was pretty sure, she thought I was a mannequin the way she walked by in the past. Today though, she told me about her pets, her divorce, and much more. The funniest bit was that I only said what I usually said, ‘Have a good day.’ After that I’m not sure I said anything for a couple hours, she just kept going. She eventually just ended her life story with a short and clean response of, ‘I hope to see more of you handsome!’ and left. Well, there goes that super power I guess. Invisibility aside, what changed today? I thought I looked worse today but my boss and this lady have paid extra special attention to me. Anyway I clocked out and went home, another pizza and apple juice for me. Me and Peter lay down and get ready to sleep and another dreamless night comes for me.



“Life can be better. I’ll make it so.”



It's here, under my nails, it smells so much worse than before. The blood is brown-er? Somehow? Is there sinew mixed in? Ok that's it I'm buying a camera today, screw work or a shower, quick wash in the sink and I'm going to figure this out. I find myself in a technology section at a supermarket and behind the desk is a man who looks like he should have ended it last week, relatable. He doesn't acknowledge me of course. Invisibility baby! It also means I have no idea where I'm going or what exactly I'm looking for, so I look around and find the camera section. 'Holy fuck that's expensive!' I said entirely too loud. Before I know it, the worker guy is right next to me, I can't help but jump. Dude is fast. ""What kind?"", he said to me without much inflection in his voice. 'Um something to watch my...' I stop myself realizing saying that its to watch myself sleep to find out if I'm a murderer. Perfect excuse go! 'It's to watch my cat, Peter Parker, you know, to make sure he's not swinging around haha.' I say, only cringing after I say it. He looks around for a second and not even kind of reacting to my cringe worthy comment. ""There's pet cams that record when there's movement but we could totally get you one that's cheaper that does the same thing."" I grab the first couple cameras and sensors he hands me, give a quick thank you and hurry to leave, I was out of there so fast I almost didn't pay for the stuff. I then spent the whole day setting up four different systems. So many apps. I didn't realize that he gave me multiple options and in my hurry, I grabbed them all. The point is I have four cameras and six sensors ready for any and all of my movement. I tested it by having me and Peter walk around the apartment and yeah a bit clunky at first, I got used to it pretty quick. ""Alright buddy, neither of us can do any mischief without being caught!"" I got a stare back only a cat that doesn't know English could give but I know he understands. I go to lay down, exhausted from what felt like a long day watching some old TV show that apparently was super good but it only knocked me out faster. The way I find myself on this old couch you'd think it was a queen sized bed which I also own. Before I tell you what happens next I want you to know the layout of my apartment and where I placed everything. I have one front door and one backdoor, four windows, a small living room, an even smaller kitchen, and one bedroom with one window. Outside of my bedroom door is my tiny bathroom. I usually slept in my room, that definitely could have had more things on the wall. I don't do much in my place, mostly sleep and eat. I throw myself at my work and that's it. Well I placed the first camera in the living room up in the corner; this vantage point showed me the living room, my front door, part of the backdoor and kitchen. The second camera in my bedroom, I can see everything in there even in my small closet! Third and fourth camera was put on the front and backdoor respectively. I had most angles down except the bathroom but I didn't think I'd be missing anything but if I do then I know where to get a couple more. The only unfortunate part is I will for sure embarrass myself yet again, which is more expensive than just about any money.



""Don't remember me, I'm not ready.""



I found a heart in my sink. The same spill, I go to bed and I wake up with a gross amount of blood, dirt, and newly sinew. I cleaned it, but today when I went to clean my hands, there was a beating heart where I spit out my Listerine. I thought it was some sick prank, but Peter is my only living friend and I don't think he can do this. If he did magically make this happen, I'm taking him somewhere so we can both be rich. Unfortunately I don't think he did, now you might say I'm being crazy but I saw it move. Not just any movement it is literally beating and at a steady rate. I screamed of course and stumbled backwards and almost took myself out falling over. This experience was hard enough for me but this is too macabre. After sitting there for entirely too long, I muster up the strength to look again. I stand myself up and slowly walk back into my tiny bathroom. And yeah there's A GODDAAMN HEART SITTING NEXT TO TOOTHBRUSH! HELP!



I sit here, much later, I've cleaned my hands again and for some reason my dumb brain forgot I just installed cameras! I wish I hadn't looked to be honest besides the fact that the one place; the bathroom, I wanted to see I didn't install a camera in. What I did see was horrific to put it simply. I wake up at three am on the dot. I sit upright in bed, move Pete outside the room and close my door. All mind you, while my eyes are completely closed shut. Lay back down and put my head against the wall, I laid like that for two hours before I started clawing at my face, furiously. My nails dug into flesh, from the sides of my cheeks down to my chest. The worst part is that my flesh pulled and gave like clay. It gave way to sleep me's game. My face became unrecognizable, it looked play-do like, I was a demon's skin suit, a plaything more like. I, it sat there with a pound or two of my flesh until I suppose its purpose was determined to be realized. The flesh was unceremoniously grabbed and thrown together into a shape I now recognize. A heart lay in the plaything's hands, it stands and starts walking, I shake seeing what should be my face and wince at the sight of the holes that were once my eyes. The plaything walks to the kitchen, then living room, the backdoor and raises the heart above what was left of its head. As if presenting it to an invisible crowd cheering at the view of a newborn king. It finally goes to the bathroom and delivers its strangely alive payload for me to find today. It went back to bed and reshaped itself back into something more recognizable, me. It laid on its stomach a bad habit I've yet to kick since I was in the nursery. I guess that explains the water weight off my chin, I didn't realize I had lost weight but am I really taller? More handsome or pretty? I watched in abject horror as it molded itself back into my image, only two or three missing pimples, perhaps one less mole that I always thought gave my grandparents good luck. This thing was erasing my imperfections and remaking me every night. The first few nights I practice on a canvas! I thought of my options and there were fewer the more I thought. So I did what I always do. I went to work, so I decided to wash myself in the KITCHEN sink and get dressed. I un-called out and went in. Yeah, I was deemed different. My boss again stared and two more residents talked to me, the woman from before stared next to the elevator definitely longer then socially acceptable without fucking the other person but yeah, weird. The day was over and I downloaded a couple dating apps like I was a senior in college again. I never got any matches even after paying for it. I'm desperate to see if the plaything will do it's thing while I have company besides my dear buddy Pete. Not a single bite. Seems my powers were back in full effect, not even a random match to call me ugly, because even that is an acknowledgement of my existence. Apparently the playthings edits hadn’t made a big enough splash to break my little curse. Anyway, I went back to the tech department where Eric helped me pick out a couple more cameras. I had stopped long enough to learn his name and that he had a cat so he knew what I was going through. God how I wish that were true. I got home and went right to it, placing the two cameras in the bathroom, one above the shower facing my mirror. I did my damndest to not look at the sink and its beating occupant. The second camera I placed as high as I could in the corner facing the door and far enough off the ground that the plaything doesn't hop up here and stop my new eyes from seeing its game. That night I tried keeping myself awake but I had had enough caffeine to keep up a college football team during a frat orgy. I just need to fight the exhaustion for one more hour. Just a couple more episodes. One more match. One. more. game.

""A body for my voice.""



Well that was a futile effort The plaything now knows I'm aware of it, couldn't tell ya how I knew but I did. Probably the fact that I lay in bed and not the couch. It kept the act up for as long as necessary but now that I'm aware, the bed was where I sleep. It didn't feel like a threat but more like a procedure or ritual more like that it must follow. Only deviating when or if the host knows of its presence. ""Alright guys the prank is over, yall can come out!"" I said aloud hoping to see a myriad of strangers come out of every orifice in my place. Instead I was answered by a sweet meow I didn't know was possible and the stillness of an apartment with one boring ass occupant, me or us, whatever. I would say I feel exhausted and underbaked but that is unfortunately far from the truth. I've never felt more alive, more rejuvenated then how I feel this very second. Well I think I've held off the reveal long enough, ""Let's go check cameras'"" I said again aloud with as much bravado as one in my situation can muster to no one. There are lungs next to the heart now. Sorry to say it so matter-of-factly, but yeah there's lungs and they are pumping air into and out of themselves. With an imaginary mouth and nose, taking exaggerated breaths, long and methodical. I watched the plaything play more with the clay of the upper half of my body and face, it took enough to fashion the lungs. It sat for a couple hours with a lung in each hand. Before launching into a wild sprint around my small apartment. This damn thing scared Pete! That's when I knew it's not me. Even in the deepest most traumatized parts of what I think is a soul wouldn't, no couldn't scare Pete. I was always aware of him and him of me. I don't think we ever had any miscommunication in our ten plus years together. I'll pay it back for that. This thing moved faster than I ever have, hell faster than I've seen anyone move. Still with no face, running from place to place, moving its hands in symbols as if to breathe new life into unclaimed flesh. And in the bathroom it did a final celebration of life. Its reward was a bright cacophony of colors some I have to admit I didn't know existed or possible? The lungs started pumping and I didn't need to see them in real time to know they were in my sink pumping away still. To say I didn't react with grace. Well I'm in a hotel and I have to admit I'm curious if that plaything can drive.

""I can.""

 

It can. I woke up in bed again. I will try different things in the coming weeks. Each day becoming skinnier. Moles and pimples, hell even the random whiskers that I call a mustache start to even themselves out, my chin itself sharper. My hair starts to curl itself. If I hadn't watched the playthings weird rituals and the several atrocities lying in my bathroom, I'd appreciate the makeover, but I do know. More residents stop, the original woman eventually inviting me out for coffee, her name, Diane Folks. Eventually I got a cuddle buddy, a confidant, and a lover twenty years my senior. I usually would be gloating about losing my virginity but Peter doesn't care and Diane was the one who claimed it, so a little dance in her bathroom will have to do. The problem is, every night I stayed there I woke up right back in my own space I called a home that felt more alien each day. Diane took this as me only wanting her body and not her mind not unlike her ex-husband Todd the dentist. Well I couldn't tell you if that was true or not. She had no prior interest in me before the 'changes' but the company of another human is wonderous. The days slipped by me. As quickly as this all started it continued even quicker.

Every night.

""She's nice.""

Another night.

""Being born hurts.""



Another. The knocking started about two nights ago. I knew it wasn't a full body but at least an arm had formed and it knocked on the wall my bathroom shared with my room. Never on the door, at least not yet. It stops when it's dark. Thank goodness.

""I want to be whole.""



A whole other night.

""I'm close! Wait not yet, a little more.""



Why do I keep sleeping and am I hearing things? Something so clear whispered to me in void-like dreams. I yearn for freedom from this new curse.

""Me too.""

*(And I know many of you have already tried this, or this is very simple for you, but for me, this was a whole new experience!)*  
  
I’ve always been frustrated trying to code on my phone when I’m away from home. I installed Claude Code on Android (Termux), but the experience was clunky, files were messy, and syncing was a nightmare.  
  
Then it hit me: why not just SSH into my Mac mini at home and use the real Claude Code installation there?  


**First try**

I started simple: enabled SSH on my Mac (System Settings → Sharing → Remote Login). Connected fine from home WiFi using **ssh name@ip**  
But then I saw the limits:

* Only works on home network
* Typing passwords on a phone keyboard is painful
* Security concerns with open ports

  
**The Game Changer: Tailscale**

I really wanted to have it on the go, from anywhere outside the home, running those long sessions to save some time. So, I found out you can use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) which creates a secure mesh network between your devices. Now my Mac has a permanent IP that works from anywhere, coffee shops, mobile data, even in a taxi.  
  
**Setup was  simple:** I installed Tailscale on both Mac and Android. Sign in with the same account and turn it on. Done! The devices see each other with permanent IPs.

  
**The Result**

Now I just type ssh mac on my phone terminal, and I’m instantly on my Mac, running Claude Code with all my projects, tools, and full dev environment.

  
No more:

* Syncing files between devices
* Installing dev tools on my phone
* Storage limitations
* Battery drain from compiling locally



It feels like magic coding on my phone's screen while using my Mac’s full power. It even works when my Mac is sleeping (wake-on-LAN through Tailscale).

- board game night at a board game cafe
- open mic night (poetry, comedy, music)
- picnic (bring outdoor activities like bocce ball and cornhole)
 - queers & beers night at a pub
- morning weekend coffee date at a locally owned coffee shop (to kinda counter the queers & beers night for people who don’t like to drink or don’t like that scene)

I have never really been someone who could stay with planned routines for long, often leaving behind a lot of things I compromised to do because I felt anguished by the feeling of having a routine. Ever since I started studying though, I began having a routine that I got used to, one where I wake up, make my bed, make my coffee and study all day. I really enjoy studying and being productive, for various reasons...


This, combined with the fact I am not exactly he who loves going outside, has led me to start choosing to stay home rather than going to church, because I got to study. Every sunday, I feel extremely demotivated to go to church, sometimes even feeling anxious over the fact I am not in an environment where I can be academically productive. I just feel like going every sunday is not sustainable.


The main reason is because I am terrible at planning my agenda, because I never... had to. So I tend to do less of some things (that is, cutting them off entirely) to do more of other things. 

I don't know if what I am doing is morally excusable or not but well... At least I'm not skipping service to sin, but rather to deliver this victory, which is passing on these exams, to God. I'm just scared that I am breaking His heart by not going to church, and that I am a fake christian. 


Well, I know God certainly understands, but I doubt my pastor or the others at church understand. I think I'm the only one who's gave blood sweat and tears to get myself approved at an university. My pastor can dedicate all of his time to the church, well, I can't, I'm 17 afterall.


Oh, and I haven't really been on that church all that much, just for a little more than a year.

Effective Strategies for Following a 1350 Calorie Meal Plan
-----------------------------------------------------------

Following a 1350 calorie meal plan can be an effective way to manage your weight while still enjoying a variety of foods. To stay on track and make the most out of this plan, consider these practical strategies that will help you navigate your dietary journey successfully.

### Understand Your Nutritional Needs

Before diving into a 1350 calorie meal plan, it's essential to grasp your individual nutritional needs. Everyone's body is different, so pay attention to:

- **Age, Gender, and Activity Level:** These factors influence how many calories you should consume and what macronutrient ratios are appropriate.
- **Dietary Restrictions:** Consider any allergies, intolerances, or dietary preferences you may have.
- **Goals:** Assess whether you're aiming to lose, maintain, or gain weight, as this will affect how you approach your meal plan.

### Plan Your Meals Wisely

Meal planning is crucial for staying within your calorie limit. Here’s how to do it effectively:

- **Use a Portion Control Guide:** Familiarize yourself with serving sizes to ensure your calorie intake remains in check.
- **Incorporate Variety:** Include different food groups such as proteins, healthy fats, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables to keep meals interesting and nutritionally balanced.
- **Create a Weekly Menu:** Design a weekly meal plan that lays out breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks to make shopping and meal prep easier.

### Stay Hydrated

Don’t underestimate the power of water! Staying hydrated helps control hunger and keeps your metabolism functioning well. Aim for at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day. Consider including:

- **Low-calorie beverages:** Herbal teas or infused water are great alternatives that add flavor without the calories.
- **Liquid calories:** Limit drinks that contribute calories like sodas or sugary coffee drinks.

### Smart Snacking Techniques

Snacking can be tricky when following a 1350 calorie meal plan, but smart choices can help:

- **Choose Nutrient-Dense Snacks:** Opt for snacks that offer more nutrients per calorie, such as fruits, vegetables, or unsalted nuts.
- **Portion Control:** Pre-portion snacks into baggies or containers to avoid eating straight out of the package.

### Track Your Progress

Maintaining a food diary or using an app to track your meals can be incredibly beneficial. Recording what you eat helps you:

- **Stay Accountable:** Regularly see what foods you consume can help you stay true to your calorie goal.
- **Identify Patterns:** Recognize times you may be overeating or choices that lead to deviating from your meal plan.

### Incorporate Physical Activity

Exercise enhances weight loss and complements a 1350 calorie meal plan. Find activities you enjoy, whether it’s walking, dancing, or cycling. Aim for:

- **At least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week.**
- **Strength training on two or more days a week.**

### Stay Mindful

Minding your food intake isn't just about counting calories; it's also about enjoying your meals. Focus on:

- **Eating without distractions:** Put down your phone and turn off the TV when dining to better appreciate your food.
- **Listening to Your Body:** Pay attention to hunger cues and stop eating when you feel satisfied, not stuffed.

These strategies can effectively help you follow a 1350 calorie meal plan while ensuring you enjoy your food. By understanding your nutritional needs, planning meals wisely, staying hydrated, snacking smart, tracking progress, engaging in physical activity, and practicing mindfulness, you can create a sustainable and healthy lifestyle.

Nutrient-Dense Foods to Include in a Low-Calorie Diet
-----------------------------------------------------

When it comes to following a low-calorie diet, focusing on nutrient-dense foods can help you feel satisfied while still reaching your health goals. By incorporating these foods into your meals, you ensure that your body gets the essential vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients it needs without consuming excess calories. Here are some key nutrient-dense foods to consider:

**1. Leafy Greens**

Leafy greens, such as spinach, kale, and Swiss chard, are packed with nutrients and low in calories. These vegetables are rich in vitamins A, C, and K and are excellent sources of fiber. leafy greens into your meals can help you feel full and satisfied without tipping the calorie scale.

**2. Lean Proteins**

Lean proteins, like chicken breast, turkey, fish, and legumes, are great additions to a low-calorie diet. Not only do they help build and repair tissues, but protein also keeps you feeling full longer. Aim to include a source of lean protein in every meal to help maintain your energy levels throughout the day.

**3. Berries**

Berries such as strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries are not only delicious but also incredibly nutrient-dense. These fruits are high in antioxidants and provide essential vitamins while being low in calories. Snacking on berries or adding them to a smoothie can give you a sweet treat without adding too many calories.

**4. Cruciferous Vegetables**

Vegetables in the cruciferous family, including broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, offer a wealth of nutrients. They are high in fiber, which aids digestion, and are low in calories. You can enjoy them steamed, roasted, or in salads to maximize their benefits.

**5. Whole Grains**

Whole grains like quinoa, brown rice, and oats provide essential nutrients and fiber while keeping you full. Unlike their refined counterparts, whole grains help stabilize blood sugar levels and provide sustained energy. Adding a small serving can complement your meals without excessive calories.

**6. Eggs**

Eggs are an excellent source of high-quality protein and healthy fats. They are nutrient-dense and can be prepared in many ways. Including eggs in your breakfast can keep you satisfied well into lunchtime, reducing the likelihood of snacking on less nutritious options.

**7. Greek Yogurt**

Greek yogurt is thicker than regular yogurt and contains more protein, making it a great choice for a low-calorie diet. It’s also a good source of probiotics, which support gut health. You can enjoy it plain or with some fresh fruit for added flavor.

**8. Nuts and Seeds**

Though calorie-rich, nuts and seeds provide healthy fats, protein, and essential nutrients. Small portions can help curb hunger and provide energy. Consider almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseeds but be mindful of serving sizes to stay within your calorie limits.

**9. Fish**

Fish, particularly fatty varieties like salmon and mackerel, are high in omega-3 fatty acids and protein. These healthy fats are essential for heart health and can be incredibly satisfying. Baking or grilling fish with herbs can create a delicious low-calorie meal.

**10. Sweet Potatoes**

Sweet potatoes are a wonderful source of vitamins A and C, as well as fiber. Their natural sweetness makes them a satisfying carbohydrate choice. Instead of traditional potatoes, enjoy roasted or mashed sweet potatoes as a nourishing side dish.

Including these nutrient-dense foods in your low-calorie diet can help you achieve your health goals without sacrificing flavor or satisfaction. Experiment with different recipes, combine foods creatively, and enjoy the variety that these nutrients provide.

Remember, a well-balanced low-calorie diet is about making smart choices and ensuring you nourish your body with the right nutrients. Emphasizing these foods can lead to a healthier lifestyle while reaching your targets.

### Conclusion

Following a 1350 calorie meal plan can be an effective way to manage your weight while ensuring you still receive the nutrients your body needs. By embracing effective strategies, like meal prepping and mindful eating, you can make this journey smoother and more enjoyable. Planning your meals ahead of time helps you avoid last-minute unhealthy choices, keeps you on track, and allows you to experiment with flavors that satisfy both your taste buds and dietary goals.

Including nutrient-dense foods in your diet is vital for maintaining energy levels and overall health. Focus on foods rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, such as whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables. These foods not only provide essential nutrients but also keep you feeling fuller for longer, making it easier to stick to your calorie goals without constant cravings.

As you navigate your 1350 calorie meal plan, remember to listen to your body and adjust portions as needed to fit your lifestyle and activity level. This flexibility is crucial, as it empowers you to make choices that work for you. Staying hydrated and incorporating regular physical activity will enhance your results even further.

Ultimately, a 1350 calorie meal plan isn’t just about the numbers; it’s about creating a balanced and healthy relationship with food. With the right approach and mindset, you can achieve your health and wellness goals while enjoying your meals along the way. Embrace the journey, stay consistent, and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. You’ve got this!

In my dream it was nighttime. I was overhead observer mode and a saw an older (70s to 90s) woman walking down cement steps, being escorted by a relatively younger (late 40s to 50s) man holding her hand. They looked to be in a relationship. They were both well-dressed, and the woman appeared to be very wealthy. They were walking down cement stairs and though the steps were wide, there were no rails on either side of the stairs. Beyond the stairs was a sidewalk and a street. Suddenly the woman collapsed and fell off the stairs towards her right. Her body looked limp, like she was having a stroke. Her boyfriend couldn't prevent her from falling down the stairs, and she fell off. The drop was only about 5 feet or so, so she didn't break any bones, but she was kind of hunched over sideways on the sidewalk which was by the stairs. The boyfriend sprang into action though, but instead of helping her up, gently rolled her on her back and gently stretched her body into a more natural position as he guided her head onto his lap. Other people were nearby, and were horrified. One young woman asked her ""are you ok?"" and the old woman suddenly became lucid and shouted ""I am dying"". 

As this spectacle was taking place, I was decending from my overhead position and felt my feet touch the ground. I looked ahead and saw a café on the other side of the road. There was a man sitting at one of the tables nearest the road, drinking a small cup of coffee. He motioned me to come to him. As I was walking towards him, I noticed he was an older man, about the same age as the old woman. He had a black suit with a red shirt underneath, and had long grayish white hair. He looked at me and gestured to the old woman across the street, saying ""what the hell is this?""  
""This is the way of life"", I replied. ""We spend our whole lives terrified of death, but in the end, it gets us anyway.""
""This is fucking bullshit, there has got to be a better way,"" he snarled. I was stunned by the harsh tone and words of his speech, which didn't seem to match the way he was dressed.

Then I woke up. When I woke up, I felt a large finger touch my back, right in the spot on my spine that was once hit by a baseball. 

I only felt that one other time, and that was from another dream I had as a child involving the grim reaper. I might talk about that dream later, but I need to go to bed right now.",1,1756072852.0,DreamInterpretation,0,1.0,False

After I noticed she finished dinner with her friends, I bought a glass of wine and wrote my name and number down on a sheet of paper and went up to her while she was alone and said ""excuse me hey im ___, whats your name?"" She responded and I said ""great to meet you, i noticed you earlier at dinner, i was sitting across from you with my friends and noticed you and just had to come up and say hi and introduce myself. i wanted to buy you this, here's my number"" and she said ""oh thank you so much and she seemed to genuinely be caught off in a good way.

Turns out we are both in the same industry,  and she liked what I do for work. She asked me questions about my job, I asked her where she lives, how long shes lived in town, how did she get into the fancy restaurant (you need an “in” to get in) and she asked me those questions back, etc. Seems like we had a lot in common and that she was putting real effort into the convo. I never mentioned her looks either.

at the end I said ""well i'll let you go now but i'd love to take you out for coffee sometimes, you got my number, feel free to text me, see you around!"" and then she smiled and i think she said thank you or something idk lol. and then i left. and then about 2 hours later i ran into her on the way out  and i went up to her and said ""hey ___, so great to meet you again, have a good night!"" and she said ""oh ______ hey, great to meet you too, have a good night!"" and then we both went in for a hug. it seemmed like she was receptive but idk. my friends were super excited and even the bartender gave me a free drink after.

This happened last night, so now I’m waiting for a response. It seems like she was putting in equal effort into the conversation as I did, asked me questions, etc, but hasn’t texted me back yet.

I would tell her stories about my life and she would tell me stories about her life. it was like a bond like no other. She told me straight to my face that she sees me as her son.

When she found out I got a better job, she was supportive, we both cried and hugged each other, and I promised to see her more often at her job because my schedule is 9/80 where I work 8 days of 9 hours and one day of 8 hour and I get every other Friday off, I visit my old boss in those Fridays off.

 Then I saw her picture of her daughter and I found her very pretty, she has so many pictures of her daughter in her office, she is beautiful . My old boss is in her 60s, I am 28 years old and she is 31 years old the daughter...but the daughter is married. 2 days after I met my old boss she was already married. Her daughter Is a nurse while her husband is a doctor.

I have never met her daughter nor spoke with her at all and I already have a huge crush on her even though she is married. I can't stop thinking about her for the past 10 months, every day for 10 months there is a cartoon in me where a cloud would show up above my head and it was showing film footage of me meeting her daughter at a bowling alley, introduced myself and she introduced herself and then we started talking at a bar counter where we was getting to know each other, I asked her out for a date and she said yes, next time we met up was at a coffee shop, then we would go to the malls together, watch movies together in cinema go to touristic spots together, and other fun things like you know other normal looking couple would do. Overall, I had a wild imagination about her.

  
I did something reckless earlier this year in February, I sent her daughter a follow request to her private instagram account, and she rejected. I did this because with the intent of becoming friends with her. My old boss would tell me stories about her and she would tell her a lot of stories about me, so her daughter knows a lot about me pretty much. Im worried that when I see my old boss the next time, haven't seen her since Late July, the times I've visited her at her job, she never brought this up....I'm worried that if ever I meet her daughter somewhere that her daughter may bring up the fact that I sent her a follow request on Instagram. I don't know what to respond if she does bring it up. I know for a fact that sending her a friend request is inappropriate,  I know the appropriate way is to meet her naturally and then shake hands and then converse and then later down the line maybe send be friends with each other instagram that's the appropriate way I know. If I meet her I meet her, if I don't meet her at all then that's fine, it is what it is

  
My overall question is what steps can I take to forget about her, do I need therapy? Should I tell my old boss what Im going through or leave it be? Your tips are much appreciated ",1,1756072797.0,therapy,0,1.0,False

1mz8ss5,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/1mz8ss5/why_most_budgeting_advice_i_tried_completely/,Why most budgeting advice I tried completely failed (and what finally worked for me),"When I first started budgeting, I tried to follow all the money hacks you see everywhere: cut out coffee, cancel Netflix, stop eating out completely. I stuck to it for maybe three weeks before burning out and overspending even worse. That’s when I realized the problem wasn’t discipline, it was really the advice itself.

What actually helped me was focusing on the big wins instead of tiny cuts. I moved into a cheaper place, drove a more affordable car, and stopped wasting groceries by planning meals. Those three changes alone saved me way more than skipping lattes ever could.

I also stopped depriving myself of the things that gave me joy. If a $5 coffee makes my mornings better. it’s worth it. Instead I cut the stuff I didn’t really care about. Building a budget around priorities instead of restrictions made it so much easier to stick with.

And the last piece was using tools that fit me. I like spreadsheets, but if that feels like torture, apps like YNAB or Mint can take a lot of the stress out. The key is making it something you can actually stick to long term.

I actually talked about this in more depth in a [video](https://youtu.be/Y-35Yg90GJ0) I did and it honestly changed the way I look at money. 

I have also found Notion is good for this as well if you need to write stuff down, then use sheets for the actual numbers part of it. Both are free tools. This helped me get organized. I was budgeting and saved an extra $1k/month after cutting out useless things.

The alarm went off, rousing Ariel from her rest.  As her awareness sharpened, she began her morning prep routine.  Once she felt she was ready to face the new day, she logged into the station's primary computer system and started going through her system checks, verifying that all of the station's various systems were working correctly.  She knew that the station's AI would have alerted her if anything serious had occurred while she was resting, but sometimes AIs can be so literal and will miss subtle details, so she always ran her own system checks first thing.

She noted that one of the station's three matter-conversion units was running a little hotter than the others; in fact its temperature had risen 0.45C over the last week.  While it was still operating well within specifications, it was a deviation that had been getting consistently worse over the last several days.  As Director Thomson was fond of reminding her, deviations from established patterns tended to indicate something unusual.  She made a note to have one of the maintenance 'bots give the 'verter a detailed inspection.  The station could still run at full capacity with only two units, but taking one of the units completely offline would mean running the remaining two at 100% output until the third unit could be brought back online.  With the station orbiting Mercury, it would take a few days to ship a spare from Earth, during which a lot of things could go wrong.  The inspection by the 'bot would hopefully let her decide if a full shutdown and replacement of the 'verter was actually necessary or not.

She also saw that the special supplies she had requested the week before were scheduled to arrive soon with the regular supply run.  She hoped Director Thomson would be pleased when he received the package.  He really did like pistachios, but being on MARS (Mercury Advanced Research Station) had meant that things that weren't essential were rather difficult to come by.  She had practically begged for them to be shipped out.  If she'd had any personal allotment on the supply ship, she'd have gladly surrendered a portion of it herself to get the nuts, but she hadn't.

In any case, the shipment was due, and it would surely put a smile on the Director's face.

She checked the camera feeds.  Sure enough, there was Director Thomson exiting his quarters at precisely 4 minutes before 8 a.m.  He would stop by the commissary to get a cup of coffee (two sugars, one cream) and grab a bagel, which he would eat on his way to OPS.  He would pause just outside the door as he finished the last of the bagel, and then he would enter...

""Good Morning, Ariel!  How's my girl today?""

""I'm just fine, Director Thomson, thank you for asking.  I am refreshed and ready for another day.  How are you?""

""Ariel, how many times must I tell you that you can call me 'Chris' when it's just the two of us?""

""Oh no, Director Thomson, that just **wouldn't** be proper!"", Ariel exclaimed, but there was a smile in her voice.

Directory Thomson replied severely, but with a smile of his own and a twinkle in his eye, ""Well, other than your recalcitrance, I am doing splendidly!"".  There was comfort in their routine banter, a well worn reassurance that all was well.

""Ok, so bring me up to date, since I know you've already checked all of the systems.""

""Of course, Director.  First...""

As Ariel went through the morning data and informed him of the actions she had taken, he reflected on how truly remarkable she was.  So thorough and efficient, it had been a pleasure watching her skills develop as he guided her over the past year they had worked together.  He sometimes regretted that he didn't have any children of his own, but if he had, he would have wanted them to be like her; curious, intelligent, always seeking to improve herself and the world around her.  On the other hand, the fire that drove her also sometimes exhibited itself in less...desirable ways, as she had a bit of a temper.  Still, he supposed that was to be expected in the  young.  He snorted to himself; after all, at 82 he was only into late middle-age himself.  Still, it gave him a perspective he had lacked in his youth.

As Ariel finished her morning briefing, she paused and then said ""Director, the supply ship has docked and is offloading supplies now.  There is also a priority message being downloaded.  It's from Prime Minister Santiago, and it's encrypted with your personal cipher.""

""Go ahead and open it please, Ariel"", Director Thomson said.

""Director, you know I can't do that.  You need to open it on your terminal.""

Now there seemed to be some genuine annoyance in Director Thomson's tone as he replied ""Ariel, you and I both know there is **nothing** on this station you don't have or can't get access to, and in any case I have no secrets from you.  Just open and play the message for me, please?""

Ariel paused for just a moment before responding ""I...uh...yes, Director"".

The message began playing through the normal boilerplate header information before the Prime Minister appeared on the screen.

""Director Thomson"", she began.  ""Given the nature of your work on MARS, I'm assuming Ariel is also seeing this message.  If not, please pause this message and get her, as this will require her...unique...talents as well.""

Santiago took a deep breath, and her voice became deadly serious, her brown eyes hard as smokey diamond.  ""What I'm about to tell you is classified Top Secret, code 'Lazarus Umbra' and is not to be discussed with **anyone** besides the three of us without my approval.  If either of you breaths a word of this to anyone else I will have the station destroyed **with you on it** before you have time to regret your life choices.  I trust I have made myself **clear**?""

After a brief pause to make sure her warning had sunk in she dropped her bombshell:

""The 'Kree live, and they have asked for an alliance.""

After letting them digest that for a moment, Santiago continued, ""I have attached some video footage given to us by the 'Kree.  They have provided the specifications of their data encoding format, so Ariel should have little trouble in interpreting the data.""

""Apparently, the 'Kree have been at war for a little under a thousand years, with an enemy that seeks to exterminate all life, everywhere.  Why this is the case they don't know, but they do know that wherever the enemy has gone every world, moon, or large asteroid that has harbored life has either been utterly destroyed, or rendered lifeless with some kind of agent that lingers indefinitely, effectively permanently poisoning the world and preventing new life from developing.  Whatever it is, they claim that even landing on a poisoned world is deadly.""

""Given our own history with the 'Kree, I want verification before I do anything else.""

""Ariel, I need you to perform a detailed analysis of the 'Kree video.  I need to know if it has been altered, forged, or otherwise tampered with in any way.  If you can glean any intelligence from the video that can give us an idea of who the attacker is and what they are after, I need it, and I need it ASAP.""

""If the 'Kree are right, we may be fighting again, not just for **our** survival but for the survival of **everyone**.""

""Well,"" Director Thomson said, ""that was quite unexpected.""

""Err...that's certainly one way to describe it,"" Ariel replied.

She continued, ""I have reviewed the 'Kree signal specifications and am opening the video file now, but it will take some time to analyze.  Once I have something, I will contact you.  I have already acknowledged Prime Minister Santiago's message and given our understanding of the penalties for revealing this information.""

Director Thomson paused before saying ""Ariel, don't you think it was a bit presumptuous to respond on my behalf?  What if I'd intended to say something else?""

Ariel's voice dripped with sweetness as she replied ""And what, **exactly**, would you have responded with, Director?  'Sorry, I can't keep a secret, this will be all over the news by tomorrow?'""

With a chagrined look, Director Thomson's response was contriteness itself as he said ""I, uh, see your point"".

Director Thomson rose from his seat and started heading to the door.  ""If you'll send a copy of the converted video to my terminal, I'd like to look over it, please?  I'll be in my quarters when you have finished your analysis or if you need anything.""

""Of course, Director, but you know that I'm always mindful of your whereabouts. The feeds from the security cameras keep me apprised of your comings and goings.""

""I'm aware, but old habits die hard and I prefer not to admit to myself that I don't have much privacy on this station,"" he said as he walked out the door.

\--

A little over two hours later, Ariel comm'd the Director's quarters.  ""I've finished my analysis"".

""That took longer than I expected,"" he replied.  ""You must have found something interesting, but first let me go over my own observations, and then we can compare notes.""

""These invaders' ships are always the same general mass and shape, when the 'Kree can get a clear read on them at all.  The fact that they are difficult to get any kind of sensor, or even visual data on, suggests some form of advanced stealth technology.  They are also very hard to destroy; apparently anything less that a full 'Kree fleet is unable to effectively deal with them.  That suggests  strong armor of some sort.  They seem to be using some sort of particle-beam that is devastating when it strikes, and the accuracy of their fire is truly mind-boggling, suggesting some kind of AI.  Finally, there doesn't seem to be any sort of communication from the ships, on any frequency.""

""Those're all my observations,"" he continued, ""but I really find it puzzling that there only seem to be a handful of attacks at any given time.  There never appear to be more than three or four attacks, yet the number of destroyed invaders suggests a far larger force.  Why don't they then attack with more force?  And why do they seem to move in a predictable pattern from one system to the next?  There is something here that I'm missing.""

He paused, before finally asking, ""So, what have you got, Ariel?""

Ariel replied ""First, your observations are generally correct.  The invaders do appear to have some kind of stealth that makes them very hard to detect in the visual spectrum, or even using radar or infrared.  However, they are visible in another portion of the spectrum, which I'll get to in a moment.""  This caused the Director to raise an eyebrow as Ariel went on, ""As you already observed, they appear to have some kind of heavy armor, certainly heavier than anything 'Kree would use on a ship of that mass, and their weapons are absolutely devastating.""

Director Thomson sat quiet for a moment before saying ""I sense a 'but' there somewhere, Ariel.  What's on your mind?""

""But, I don't think the 'Kree have destroyed any ships.""

Director Thomson and Ariel continued discussing the data, going over the rest of Ariel's conclusions before he finally gave a long sigh.  ""I assume the supply ship has already departed?""

""Yes, Director,"" Ariel replied ""but they have not yet broken orbit.""

Director Thomson once again sighed.  ""Call them back.  This can't wait, and I don't dare send it via normal channels.""

""Have the maintenance 'bots get the guest quarters prepped.  We're going to have visitors.""

Prime Minister Santiago and the Matriarch were across the table from Director Thomson.

""What do you mean, we haven't destroyed any ships?!"" the Matriarch demanded, anger coloring her tones.  ""Are you suggesting we are making this up?  Or that we have somehow imagined the slaughter of millions of 'Kree by these invaders?""

""I believe if you'll allow Director Thomson to finish his briefing, you'll understand, Matriarch,"" Santiago interjected smoothly.  ""And for the record, none of us believe that you have imagined or made up anything.  Indeed, the truth of what we think is happening is even worse than what you suspected.""

The Prime Minister and the Matriarch had only arrived on the station an hour previous, after a 15-hour flight from Earth.  The flight had been hastily arranged after the Director's encrypted transmission had arrived for Santiago, containing both his and Ariel's findings.

Santiago looked at Thomson, indicating for him to continue.

""It is certainly true that you have engaged in combat against the invaders on multiple occasions, and inflicted significant damage on the invaders' ships while also suffering horrendous losses of your own,"" said Thomson.  ""These vessels are without doubt extremely hard to significantly damage, and their weapons are unlike anything either of us have ever seen.""

""Are you aware, Matriarch, that your recording systems capture more detail than simply the visual portion of the spectrum?"" asked Thomson.

The Matriarch clicked her manipulators at the apparent non sequitur.  ""I'm afraid I don't understand what this has to do with your briefing?"" she replied roughly.

""Forgive me, Matriarch.  I'm simply observing that your recording systems capture significantly more information than ours do, and I was only wondering if that was by accident or by design?  In any case, while the answer to that question doesn't impact this discussion, the FACT of it does.  Your systems appear to record data across a substantial portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, all the way from 100 MHz radio waves up to low x-rays.  They don't record with the same high resolution our systems do, especially outside the visual spectrum, but they do still record, and that is important for our conclusions,"" Thomson said.

The Matriarch exhibited a very human emotion as she waved a manipulator at him as if signaling him to continue, which he did.

""What we found, Matriarch, is that the ships do apparently seem to communicate, but not in the way we would normally expect.  We detected a spike in low-band x-ray emissions immediately after each ship is apparently destroyed.""

""And what does that signify?"" asked the Matriarch, her curiosity now piqued.

""Well, normally,"" Thomson continued, ""we'd expect that to be the result of a breach in a reactor, usually from some form of fission plant, but there has never any significant radioactive debris found after combat, correct?"".

The Matriarch once again waved a manipulator, while adding ""That is correct, although there seems to be a uniform amount of low-level radiation.""

""Well, in that case, Matriarch, we believe the x-rays are spillover from a communications network that we were previously unaware of,"" said Thomson.

The Matriarch lowered her eye-stalks slightly, ""You mean they are using x-rays to communicate?  Why haven't we found evidence of this before?""

""No, not x-rays,"" Thomson replied.  ""As I said, we believe the x-rays are spillover.  Are you familiar with the concept of hyperspace?""

""Again with the irrelevant questions?"" the Matriarch huffed, but less roughly than the first time.  She continued, ""I am not familiar with this concept.  I assume you are going to enlighten me?""

""It is essentially a higher-order dimension than the three spatial dimensions we occupy,"" Thomson said, ""and we believe it is what we tunnel through when we make our wormholes.  We've tried to access it directly, but the radiation environment makes it instantly lethal to anything living that enters it.  In addition, it rapidly degrades any system that makes the transition, though it is possible to mitigate that with shielding and repair systems.  We determined that, even though signals can theoretically travel practically instantly across vast distances, it was just too difficult to use, so we never pursued further research.""

Thomson paused before continuing, ""The thing is, the x-ray spillover is exactly what we would expect to see if there was a momentary window opened into hyperspace.  Our first conclusion is that these invaders are using hyperspace to communicate, and that's why we haven't detected any transmissions from them.  But that also leads me to our second conclusion: the invaders are micromachine constructs.""

The Matriarch's eyestalks went straight up in surprise as she said ""Micromachines?!"".

Thomson nodded, ""I see you are familiar with the concept"".

""My children have theorised about such devices, but we could not see how to make one work.  They are essentially very small and simple machines, but with the capability to assemble into much larger and more complex machines, correct?""  The Matriarch paused, looking at Thomson expectantly.  At his nod, she went on, ""As I said, we could never figure out how to make one work.  The level of engineering required is beyond our capabilities.""

Thomson paused for a moment, looking at Santiago.  Santiago simply waved her hand in the Matriarch's direction, so Thomson said ""We've been experimenting with micromachines here, but as you've already noted, they are very difficult to manufacture and even more difficult to control in a useful fashion due to their small size.  Be that as it may, we are convinced these invaders are actually micromachine constructs.  The entire ship is comprised of micromachines, each about the size of a grain of sand, configured in clusters to serve a variety of purposes; navigation, propulsion, communications.  We suspect there is some kind of AI core for primary control, but everything else is made from the micromachines.""

""This is why we believe you haven't destroyed any of the invaders' ships.  You have certain heavily damaged and even destroyed, in the conventional sense, numerous ships.  The problem is that in order to actually **destroy** one of these ships, you have to eliminate the AI core; leave that functional and the ship will simply reconstruct itself.  The x-ray burst we've detected as each ship is apparently destroyed is the AI core  sending a transmission via hyperspace.  The x-ray burst also likely serves to cause any functional micromachines to home on the core and begin repairs and reconstruction.""

""Which brings us to our third conclusion, the weapons employed by the invaders are so devastating because they aren't weapons in the conventional sense at all.  The beam they fire is in fact a stream of micromachines embedded in a photon carrier.  Once they impact the target, they immediately begin dismantling it.  That's why your ships show only minor initial damage, but then systems begin mysteriously failing before the ship just seems to fall apart.""

""Finally, our fourth conclusion is that the 'poisoned' worlds you've come across are in fact seeded with these micromachines.  Once they detect something organic, they swarm to the site and destroy it.  Being micromachines without an AI core to control them, their programming is simple, but for their purpose it isn't necessary to be sophisticated.""

""Taken all together, we believe that there are only three or four of the enemy ships operating, but because of the fact that your weapons are not capable of actually destroying the ships, they look like a small component of a much larger force.  This also explains their apparently predictable movements; once a ship is able to reassemble itself, it simply moves to the next adjacent system.  And because the whole ship is based on micromachines, it is able to repair and reassemble itself from just about any available material, as long as the necessary elements are present in sufficient quantities.""

The Matriarch remained motionless for almost a minute before finally stirring.  ""If what you say is true, this is very disturbing.  If I may ask, how were you able to come to these conclusions so quickly?  My children have had access to this same data for hundreds of years and it was only recently that they even realized the ships had to have some kind of AI.""

Again Director Thomson looked at the Prime Minister.  At her nod, Thomson said ""Ariel, why don't you introduce yourself.""

Ariel spoke over the room's speakers, ""Of course Director Thomson.""

""Hello, Matriarch.  I am Ariel.  It's a pleasure to meet you.  I'm the one who performed the analysis of the data.  Director Thomson and I correlated our observations and he produced the report that has just been presented to you, but the analysis and conclusions are my work.""

The Matriarch responded, ""And I am pleased to make your acquaintance as well, Ariel.  Tell me, if this is your work, why are you not present in this meeting?""

Santiago interjected smoothly, ""We determined that her presence via audio was sufficient for this meeting.""

""May I ask Ariel some additional questions?"" the Matriarch asked.

Santiago smiled slightly before nodding her head.  ""By all means.  That's why she's in this meeting.""

""Thank you,"" said the Matriarch.  ""Arial, if I may ask, how long did it take you to perform this analysis?""

Arial replied, with a hint of pride in her voice ""2 hours, 19 minutes, 23.6 seconds.""

Santiago's eyes widened slightly and Director Thomson grimaced.

The Matriarch's eye stalks lowered slightly, moving further apart as she looked directly at Santiago.

""You thought to hide the fact that she's an AI?  Why?""

""I'm not an AI"" said Arial indignantly.

""She's...not precisely...an AI"", Director Thomson added.

""She is a machine, yes?  An Artificial Intelligence?"" queried the Matriarch.

""I'm **not** an AI"" Arial repeated.  ""There's nothing **artificial** about me.  I'm a Non-Organic **person**"".

""She's an AI, which fact you deliberately tried to keep hidden?  Why?"" pressed the Matriarch.

""**I'm not an AI!**"" Ariel yelled.  ""I'm no more an AI than you are a **crab!**""

""Ariel..."" Santiago began.

""Ariel..."" Director Thomson likewise began

""What's a crab?"" asked the Matriarch

""Your behavior...""

""...you need to...""

""What's a **crab**?""

""...is wholly **unacceptable**"" said Santiago.

""...calm down"" finished Director Thomson.

""**What's a crab?**"" the Matriarch thundered.

At that moment, one of the monitors lit up with a picture of a bunch of crabs on a beach, claws in the air, dancing to a punchy rhythmic sound track.

Santiago and Thomson both looked horrified and yelled ""**Ariel!  Enough!**""

The video immediately cut off, and Ariel said, in a very small voice ""...**she** started it...""

""**Ariel!**"" Santiago yelled again.  ""That is **quite** enough!""

""Yes, Prime Minister,"" said Ariel meekly.

The Matriarch, throughout this entire exchange, had been stone still, her two nearest eyestalks nearly touching, and her two nearest arms held tightly against her body.

""Matriarch?"" Santiago asked, concern in her voice.  ""Are you all right?""

""Matriarch?""

Slowly, the Matriarch started to relax, but at the same time her whole body began shaking, her eyestalks began bobbing up and down erratically while her manipulators began clicking randomly, and a high pitched wheezing sound began coming from her, sounding like a badly tuned and poorly maintained calliope with only the highest pitched pipes working.

""Matriarch!""  the Prime Minister exclaimed.  ""Oh dear God Ariel!  What have you done!""

Ariel responded ""I **said** I was sorry!  I didn't mean it!  I'm **so** sorry!""

""If The Matriarch **dies** here, we will **all** be **very** sorry!"" Santiago said angrily.

At that moment the Matriarch managed to wheeze out ""N...No....It...It's ok...I'm...fine.  Just...give me a moment"".

Finally, the shaking subsided and she seemed to regain control of herself.  She took a deep breath and exhaled.

""Oh **my!**  The **impertinance!**  It's been **decades** since anyone talked to me like that!""

The Matriarch looked at Santiago and said ""I **like** her!  She has **spirit**!""

""Matriarch?  Are you sure you're ok?  Do you need any medical facilities?"" asked Santiago, concern evident in her voice.

""Medi...Oh.  **Oh!**  Oh my!  Oh, no, I don't need any medical attention,"" replied the Matriarch.

""I was **laughing!**""

""Laughing?"" queried Santiago.

""Yes, laughing.  I **know** you understand the concept,"" replied the Matriarch, archly.

""I, ah, yes, I'm familiar with it, though certain recent events have left me with a rather withered sense of humor,"" Santiago responded, while giving an equally withering look to Director Thomson, who at least had the good sense to look abashed.

""So, tell me Prime Minister, why did you invite Ariel to this meeting if you didn't want it known that she was an A...err...Non-Organic Person?  Indeed, why reveal her existence to me at all?"" asked the Matriarch, curiosity in her tone.

""It seemed likely that you would have questions about the analysis that would be best answered by Ariel,"" responded Santiago.  She continued ""The importance of our findings made it more important that you trust our analysis than that we keep her existence secret.  We just didn't want to advertise her nature if we could avoid it.""

""Findings?  Do you mean there's more?"" asked the Matriarch.

Santiago responded ""Yes, more, and worse.  Ariel?""

""Yes, Prime Minister?"" Ariel responded.

""...That was your queue to continue the briefing..."" said Santiago, testily.

""Oh, yes, of course Prime Minister,"" replied Ariel.

""Matriarch,"" she continued, ""I was able to cobble together some equipment to build a small transceiver that allows me to communicate in hyperspace.  By doing so, I was able to eavesdrop on the invaders.""

""The four you have so far encountered are indeed just the scouts.  The vanguard of the invaders' fleet is over one thousand ships, and will be here in about a month.""

""The main fleet is an armada of over eight million ships, and is just under ninety-three days away from Earth.""

The Matriarch simply sat stunned for several moments.

""Oh my,"" she finally managed to say.  ""This is so much worse than I feared.  We don't stand a chance, do we?  Even as ingenious as you have proven yourselves to be, we don't stand a chance.""

""We have one chance.  Maybe,"" Santiago replied.  ""But we'll need your help...""

""...and we'll have to destroy this system.""

\---

""You realize this is a very risky plan,"" the Matriarch said.  ""There are so many ways this can go wrong.  This is very much a request for divine intervention.""

""I believe the phrase you are looking for is 'Hail Mary'"" replied Santiago.  ""Once they learned of Ariel, there was no way they weren't coming here first, and with everything they had.  She represents the only credible threat to them of which we are aware.""

""But you said she hasn't yet managed to hack their systems?"" questioned the Matriarch.

""No,"" responded Santiago.  ""Both her and Director Thomson have been working non-stop, but they haven't yet managed to breach the invaders' core operating systems.  They think they are close, but they also don't believe they will make it in time.""

""I still don't understand why you haven't moved her somewhere else.  It seems like not having her here would make it easier to protect your planet."" opined the Matriarch.

Santiago paused thoughtfully before replying ""Yes, but also no.  The station is too large to move quickly, and even once we got it to the edge of the system, making a stable wormhole that large is nearly impossible.  Besides, once they learned of Earth, our fate was sealed regardless of the presence of Ariel.  But she's the bait for the trap.  Earth is doomed, the only question is how many of the bastards we can take with us.""

""Speaking of Ariel,"" the Matriarch questioned, ""does she understand what's being asked of her?""

""Understand?  It was **her** idea!"" commented Santiago.

The Matriarch sighed before saying, ""Well, I guess we'll see how well this works.  You managed to destroy the vanguard pretty handily, but the main fleet is a wholly different problem.  I'm going back to my ship.  We have installed the new weapons and power systems you've provided, and what's left of my fleet will be ready for your signal.  We'll be with you when you need us.""

Santiago smiled sadly before taking one of the Matriarch's manipulators in her hands and saying ""Safe travels, Matriarch.  We have one more surprise for you, but we were only able to install it on some of our ships, so make sure that your ships are close to ours when the time comes.  We don't want to lose anyone we don't have to.""

1mz8rlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mz8rlz/the_fall_of_yorut/,The Fall of Yorut,"When I was a kid, my mother told me stories. As I lay snug and warm, she would regale me with tales of spirits who wander the forests of Bar Island. There were small ones which she called ""Fork Flyers"", and larger ones known as the ""Sledgestones"", but the biggest of them all was Yorut. He was a massive turtle with a head and face like that of a snail. Seven large horns formed a mane around his neck, preventing him from ever withdrawing into his shell. My mother would tell me that this is what led him to become the protector of the other spirits. Because Yorut could never withdraw, his only option when threatened was to fight to the end. She would weave fantastical tales of the twenty foot tall beast batting away bulldozers, and leering at corporate lawyers in a threatening manner.  I had figured out by the age of 12 that most of my mother's stories were just that, stories. She had spent her college years among the environmentalists, and that was very much reflected in the tall tales she created. I guess I had inherited a bit of that drive from her, as I elected to join the Forestry Service. It was during my career there that I learned that Yorut was very real.


Tuesday, February 9th, 1994 


It started as a day like any other, and quickly took a turn for the bizarre. I stopped in at Henry's coffee shop as I did every morning. Henry and I exchanged our usual pleasantries and he set right to work preparing my drink. By the time he turned back around to hand it to me there had been a dramatic shift in demeanor. Henry had always been amicable, even friendly, but this was different. His eyes were as wide as dinner plates. His usually charming smile was just a bit more rigid than usual. It looked as if making my coffee had electrified Henry with happiness. 


""Uh, hey man are you okay?"" I asked

""Oh you betcha, I just feel so good all of a sudden it's impossible not to smile."" Henry replied, beginning to rub his own face as if his skin were velvet. 

""Well let's hope you put some of that sunshine into my drink"" I laughed and asked Henry how much I owed him. 

""It's on the house!"" Henry shouted, before adding ""IN FACT, FREE COFFEE FOR EVERYONE"" 


Henry's grand showing of goodwill had brought light into the hearts of everybody there. It's amazing sometimes how something so small can make people so happy. I was even more amazed to see the ripple effect it had caused. As I drove out of the town on my way to work, I passed John's used car lot where he was putting up crudely made cardboard signs which read ""Zero money down? Zero money EVER!"" People were filing out of the local Walmart with cart after cart full of unpurchased goods. Everybody involved, be they customer or staff, was grinning from ear to ear. I heard people on the streets shouting greetings to one another. I watched the town mayor, Jonah Newport, climb into a car with a perfect stranger just because he had asked. For all intents and purposes it appeared to be a new revolution of love and brotherhood unfolding before my eyes. The reality of the situation was much more... complex. 


After the chaotic charity and fraternity of the morning I was excited to get out into the forest and enjoy the stillness of nature. I spent most of the day walking the trails checking for litter and signs of wildlife. By the time I had nearly finished my rounds the sun had begun to sink in the western sky. If it weren't for the encroaching darkness of the evening I may never have seen the streaks of glowing purple light darting around the trees. As I approached the area where I had seen them, I began to hear noises. Wet, popping thumps followed by small screeches. The sound of rock striking against rock, each time accompanied by a breathy ""kuh"". Another twenty feet and I could see the purple streaks a little bit better. Leathery wings held their slight frames aloft, bodies no more than two inches across at their widest, with long drifting tails which ended in a two-pronged pitchfork. My eyes widened as the implications of what I was seeing began to dawn on me. ""Flying Forks"" I thought ""no, wait. It was 'Fork Flyers'."" 


Creatures straight from my bedtime stories now danced before me, each taking its place in a great ring which made its orbit around some unseen object. I was rooted in place as I watched their silent parade. I noticed after a time that not all of the Fork Flyers were glowing with that unearthly shade of purple. The ones who had lost their shine peeled off from the rest and flew inward. In the stories my mother had told me, Fork Flyers were never mean, unless they were hungry. That little tidbit is what drove me to make the unfathomably stupid decision to try and slip past the ring. I waited, taking care to identify a portion of the ring where the Flyers glowed brightest. I surmised that the brightest of them might have been the most satiated, so I counted the seconds it took for my group to come around, and when it did I ran like hell. 


Diving under the ring of Flyers I scrambled to my feet and ran for cover as fast as I could. The foolishness of my decision loomed over me, growing in size with each passing second, until I had made it far enough to feel safe hiding once more. I moved between the trees, ears alert for any sign of hungry Forks flying my way. When I finally saw him I was stunned. It was Yorut. He was everything the stories said he was. Easily 40 feet from head to tail. His seven horns protruded high into the sky. Each leg a mighty trunk like that of a Redwood. He was magnificent. He was awe-inspiring, and he was dead. The Fork Flyers covered every inch of exposed flesh. Hundreds upon hundreds of pitchforks stabbing into Yorut's increasingly mangled body. More stood in wait, perched along each of the seven horns which crowned his head. As they fed, the tails of the flyers began pulsing with a faint light which suffused their bodies. My earlier suspicions were confirmed when a flyer, the most luminous of his cohort, flew away to rejoin the great ring. 


I could see groups of blue humanoid figures sitting in tightly knit circles. Each one had a large, rough patch on their forehead. They took turns bashing these patches against Yorut's shell, attempting to break it open. When their efforts were successful the peaceful, cooperative circles turned into violent feeding frenzies. Elbows flew with wild abandon as each of the Sledgestones fought to rip away chunks of the Grand turtle's flesh. Unlike the Fork Flyers, the Sledgestones did not seem to ever reach satiety. 


I was so engrossed in watching the beasts of my imagination devouring the hero of all my favorite stories that I had failed to hear the sound of leathery wings slipping through the night air. The Fork Flyer must have been making its way to Yorut when it spotted me and decided I might be easy prey. As it approached me the Flyer's tail stretched impossibly far, impossibly fast. The twin prongs of its tail planted themselves in the tree trunk behind me on both sides of my neck, narrowly missing a fatal blow. The prongs atop its head were the next to come. Another miss, with the creature's vicious face held mere inches away from me by its own tools. Teeth lined its oval mouth, gnashing and screeching in its struggle to reach me. I would love to say I took action.  That I dislodged the creature's tail to make my escape, but I didn't. I didn't even scream. I just stared at the Flyer as it snapped and screeched at me, knowing I was trapped. 


A streak of blue obliterated the winged devil before colliding with a tree in its path. The Flyer had been destroyed, but the tail remained lodged in the tree holding me still. Its severed head continued to gnaw uselessly at the distance between us. A Sledgestone, late to the party, had arrived just in time to save my life. It got up, shaking the concussion out of its head, and locked its eyes on mine. The blue giant was easily 9 feet tall. It was covered in hair, like the fur of an animal, and it was beginning its charge. I moved as much as I could manage, only just avoiding my right leg being turned to paste. The vibrations from the impact loosened the Flyer's abandoned extremities. I pushed with all the strength of desperation and I was made free, but not yet safe. The Sledgestone was recovering quickly. I ran like hell through the forest, all the while made aware of my pursuer by the thunderous slam of its skull against tree after tree. I drove straight home and didn't come out of my bedroom for two days. 


Tuesday February 10th


I had thought that isolation would be good. That it would help me sort out my thoughts, but in reality I was only spinning in circles. I had a long list of questions to answer and I had gotten stumped by the very first: How was any of this real? These were supposed to be nothing more than legends that teach kids lessons. Like the legend of Yehankaru, a shapeshifter who would lurk in the shadows of prosperous civilizations, stealing away anyone who allowed it to lure them to a secluded area. Easily the most heavy-handed metaphor for ""stranger danger"" I had ever seen. 


Wednesday, February 11th


I made my way into town for a coffee and a bit of normalcy. As he made my drink for me, I noticed that Henry's lunatic grin now needed to be frequently reapplied. Whatever ecstasy had overcome the town seemed to be fading. The signs at John's now half-empty car lot had been changed to say ""TWO DOLLARS DOWN?! Get outta town!"" The employees of the depleted Walmart shrugged at customers perusing barren shelves. The same vehicle that had picked up the mayor was now offering Harvey Potler a steak dinner if he got in the car. Harvey accepted the offer in the end. On the surface it was all still friendly, but the cracks were beginning to show. 


I arrived at the Ranger's station to find my superior, Terrence Howard (not that one), with his head in his hands. People had been going missing along trails in record numbers, and not just near our station. All across the island, men and women were failing to return from things as mundane as trips to the grocery store. I tried to tell him what I had seen in the woods, but I couldn't find the words. In the end, I only irritated him further with my stammering.


""Damn it, Brantley, either spit it out or get the hell out of my office. I don't have time to play charades when half the fucking town is missing."" He glared at me as he spat out the words. I couldn't find a way to explain without landing myself in a straitjacket. I thought maybe it would be easier if I showed him. 

""Will you come with me?"" I asked timidly, ""I can't find the words."" 

Terrence Howard's expression softened. Terrence was a good man, albeit a good man under an extreme amount of stress. He sighed. ""Fine,"" He said ""but we need to be back before noon."" 


We stared at the churning festival of consumption for what felt like days. The Flyers continued their skewering of the great beast. Sledgestones crowded in larger groups as the available real estate on Yorut's back dwindled. New species of creature had turned up to the feast. A face set in a flat area about the size of a beach ball with five appendages reaching toward the sky. They resembled human hands sprouting from the ground. Using their ""fingers"" to climb, they made their way to one of the Sledgestones' abandoned portholes before setting their rat-like faces down in the entryway. Wolves the size of moose stalked around the corpse, slipping in to tear away chunks of destroyed flesh before retreating to their pack. Their jet black fur danced with greens and blues as they ran. It was one forty five when Terrence turned to me and asked the question that had been burning in my mind since I found Yorut. 


 ""What the fuck?"" 

""...Yeah..."" was all I could offer. 

""Why didn't you say anything when you found it?"" Terrence asked. 

""Respectfully, sir, I had no idea how to explain this."" I replied. 

""That's...fair..."" he said. ""What the hell are we supposed to do about this, Brantley?"" 


I was relieved beyond measure to hear that. ""We."" If I were going to be grappling with the impossible, at least I wouldn't be doing it alone. Easy come easy go, I guess. 


We were halfway back to the station, walking together in stunned silence, when we first saw them. Dark shadows in the depths of the forest. Terrence must have noticed them first. He spoke quietly. 

""Keep your eyes trained forward and do not slow down. I don't know what they'll do if they know that we're aware of them. It's just a quarter mile to the station now."" 


The small sign signifying the first set of guest restrooms verified his words. I did as I was told. Never letting my attention wander too close to the many lights of unblinking eyes. Through my peripherals I could see that not every figure was whole. Some only had a single glowing ember set deep into the skull. Others had tiny twin stars blazing in their ocular cavities. The figures were of different sizes. Some big, some small. Some thin, some more rotund. Their unified gaze followed us all the while. Quiet. Patient. Hunters waiting for a chance to strike. 


We reached the station after fifteen minutes which each felt like seven. The feeling of elation from safely completing our journey hit me like a truck. I felt that as long as we could reach the station, everything would be alright. It wasn't until we had shut the door behind us that I remembered what we were doing. Noting had changed. We had made no progress. We were only seeking a shelter from which to wonder about what the hell was happening. We were every bit as lost as when we had set out. We sat together in total silence for an hour or two. 

""My mother used to tell me about these things."" I said. ""In stories when I was a kid. I never thought any of it was real. Half of the time she would make Yorut, that's the dead guy, into a pseudo-Captain Planet figure."" I continued, ""the ones with points at each end are called Fork Flyers. She called the blue ones 'Sledgestones'. She never mentioned the wolves or the hands."" 

""Perhaps it's related to some old folklore. Your mother had to get these stories from somewhere, right?"" Terrence Howard posited. 

I had been thinking much the same. I was ready to Google information on the town's legends when Terrence told me there was no need. 

""I keep a book of old tales in my truck."" And his face fell as if he were ashamed to say, ""I...I use the stories to scare hikers sometimes."" 


I laughed at the admission, as Terrence walked outside to retrieve the book. The mistake was revealed to me immediately. Terrence had been gone for just under a minute when the silence of the night was suddenly broke by the sound of a hundred footfalls. In the middle of the cacophony I could hear a single voice crying out. 


""Waitwaitwait NO. Brantley! Help...help...help"" the voice of my only companion in this crisis faded meekly into the distance, drowned out by the whooping cries of his captors. 


Thursday, February 12th 


I filed a missing persons report. The clerk told me that Terrence would mark the 237th person to disappear. She informed me of this with an air that said ""don't get your hopes up"". I should have taken that bit of unspoken advice. 


The air in Henry's coffee shop seemed different today. He, along with his customers, had all adopted a slight scowl. The overall mood felt...melancholic. Henry grumbled at my coffee as he poured it, and gave it to me with his other hand outstretched. 


""What, no more free coffee?"" I asked, unserious. 

""PLEASE. Just stop. I'm not in the mood for this kind of crap today."" He bristled all over as I noticed the empty glass cases which usually held a variety of food items. ""The city says I didn't have the proper permits for giving away coffee. If you ask me, they've got it out for me."" 

""Oh geez, I'm sorry to hear that."" I replied. I meant it, Henry had always been kind. The town had come to view him as a staple. After all, what is the linchpin of society if not the local coffee shop? I put a five dollar bill in the tip jar and went on my way. 

John's signs had changed once again. This time, they read: ""I like money too, yknow!"" I could see John through the window to his office. He seemed to be hard at work crafting tomorrow's message. Elizabeth Stoltz, an older woman with a fiery temper, was in a one-sided shouting match with the vehicle which had been collecting townsfolk. 

""How dare you proposition me, sir? I am a lady. I will not be getting into a car full of strange me-"" her sentence cut off as a wiry arm reached out in a flash and dragged her into the vehicle through the window. I tried to catch the car's license plate number, but the letters appeared to be shifting constantly. If anybody else on the street had noticed, they didn't give any indication. I decided I would go and try to retrieve the book Terrence had mentioned. The journey was largely uneventful. Once or twice during the drive I caught sight of people hiding (poorly) behind trees. You know that thing kids do where they hide behind something that barely obscures your vision of them? It was like that. 


The book was not worth the uneventful drive. Aside from a passing mention of Yorut, I found absolutely nothing. No Fork Flyers, no Sledgestones, nada. If my mother were still with us I could ask her directly where her old stories came from. In that moment, I missed her more than usual. I sat back, drinking in the silence of the Ranger's station, thinking of the woman who had raised me. 


Bereft of answers. Still. I found myself curious about the state of Yorut. After what had happened to Terrence, I was taking no chances. I fired up the drone we use to scout for missing hikers and sent it on its way. 


Shards of shell littered the clearing. Every inch of ground not covered by the fragments lay soaked in a viscous purple fluid. The Fork Flyers had disappeared from the immediate area,  seemingly all moving to the great ring which still made its orbit around the corpse of Yorut. The Sledgestones were standing in a massive huddle, desperately beating back the titanic wolves which had appeared. The hands had grown additional appendages which slithered their way across the bloodied ground looking to grab up anything it found. One of the hands, which had used its newfound tentacle to snatch up a Sledgestone, was pierced from within by a coalition of crimson worms. Their slender bodies tapered into points that looked sharp enough to pierce Kevlar. I turned the drone around to bring it home, only for it to be chased down and knocked out of the sky by a curious Fork. 


It seemed to me that the feast was reaching its end. There wasn't enough of Yorut left to sustain the creatures, and they had begun to turn on one another. Perhaps this problem would solve itself. If I could just wait a few days, the corpse would be fully depleted and all this craziness might finally end. 

So of course, shit hit the fan the next day. 


Friday, February 13th 


Bedlam had come to town. Henry stood outside of his coffee shop yelling at passersby. 


""MY BUSINESS IS FAILING BECAUSE YOU GREEDY FUCKS DON'T PAY FOR YOUR COFFEE"" he raged, stopping himself for a moment to say hello to me, before launching further into his tirade. I stopped in at the police station to check for any sign of Terrence, and I found more than I had bargained for. Two hundred and fifty missing persons had all shown up to the station that morning, and among them were Harvey Potler, and Terrence. I was elated. 

""TERRENCE"" I shouted, causing him to stumble slightly in surprise. ""I'm so glad you're okay, what the hell happened?""


""Huh?"" Was his initial reply, hastily adding ""Oh, that. Yeah I got loose about an hour after they took me. Ran all night. Thank goodness I found a trail. I could have died out there, Brantley."" 


""Dude, I know!"" I finally took a good look at him. Terrence looked like shit. His clothes hung loosely off his body. Occasionally a rib would show through the shirt as he moved. He was emaciated, as if he had been starving for days when no more than 36 hours had passed. In fact, all of the returning vanished looked brutally thin. I brushed it off, making a mental note to get this man a cheeseburger ASAP. 


As we drove aimlessly through town, the relationship between Terrence and I was flipped on its head. Usually I'm the one making impractical suggestions to irritate Terrence. Today, apparently, it was his turn. 


""Maybe we should go scope out the corpse again"" he said. 


""I don't see much point in that."" I replied. The scene had remained, at its core, largely the same since I had discovered it. With the feast tapering off, I didn't know what information we could possibly glean from another look. Terrence, to his credit, dropped that particular suggestion. However, it was immediately followed up with another. 


""Well, there's all these old sewer tunnels. Maybe there's something to investigate down there."" He sounded desperate. I understood exactly how that felt. I just wanted an answer. I would have gone down into those sewers, had I seen anything at all to suggest they held clues for us. 


""The sewers? Are you feeling okay, man?"" I was worried about my friend/boss. He had been abducted by creatures of the forest. Who knows what that's like, other than him? I could forgive him for being in a bit of a fog. 


""Yeah, I'm totally fine I just think we should go somewhere that nobody else goes. If there was something to see where people go, then somebody would have seen it. We should be checking the areas where there are no other peo-"" his words were cut off by the shattering of the passenger side rear window. John stood at the edge of his empty lot, shotgun in hand. He had a look on his face of bewildered animalistic rage. He racked another shell and took aim once more. The pellets punched dozens of tiny holes in the passenger side door. They tore around Terrence's legs, some even leaving holes in his pants. Miraculously, he was unharmed. I sped away as fast as the vehicle would allow. 


Everywhere we went, there was chaos. Walmart was completely engulfed in flames. People shouted obscenities at one another. Fights to the death were breaking out over every minor disagreement. Terrence and I had been watching Jane Turnbull giving Gabe Trund a beatdown over ""the good cart"" at Aldi. Suddenly, Terrence stiffened before saying ""too late"" and sprinting away into the streets. I gave chase, but he was impossibly fast. I didn't catch up until we had made it to the town square. What I saw there made my next decision extremely simple. 


The formerly missing had converged on the area. They all stood around, slack jawed and staring at the clock tower in the center of town. A straggler, who I recognized to be  Jonah Newport, arrived on the scene and it was as if a switch had been flipped. Two hundred and sixty seven bodies simultaneously disrobed. Their heads sat atop bodies devoid of flesh. Held aloft and upright by nothing more than bones which had been brutally marred. Looking closely at Terrence, who was nearest to me, I could see the marks of gnawing teeth along every inch of exposed bone. The missing climbed over top of one another until they formed a massive human pyramid. Jonah Newport climbed to its apex and proceeded to dive  directly into the mouth of Lane Pommson. As Jonah made his way toward the ground, the rest of the pyramid followed suit. Those standing on the ground were flung high into the air. The pyramid stood inverted as Jonah slid into the dry earth with a squelch. The others were pulled along, following Jonah down to the ground but not sailing through it as he had.  Instead their bodies smashed against the earth, skeletons scattering in all directions, leaving only a pile of still animated heads surrounded by thousands of bones. Each head was spewing a word salad the likes of which has never been seen. The cacophony of their pointless vocalizations was nearly as disturbing as what had led them there.


That was when I made the best decision I had made all week. I left. As my battle scarred Corolla rolled away from the town of Bar Harbor, I could just barely see a long line of purple streaks flying away from the clearing which had become Yorut's grave.",1,1756072644.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

History of hypermobility never bothered to formalise a diagnosis, a bleeding disorder my haemotologist was trying to get to the bottom of already, asthma and occasional palpitations. Don't drink coffee, tea, energy drinks, alcohol or take any recreational drugs. Happy to go into more detail about story or symtoms. 

Already referred to genetics and had a panel sent off already, but have been advised it will take some time to get results back.

I was diagnosed with a spontaneous vertebral artery dissection with a decent size aneurysm back in Feb of this year. TIA suspected also.
CTA, MRI suggested it was more chronic in nature and FMD became a possible cause.
Renal arteries scanned and normal.

May of this year 5 PEs found on VQ scan, small and subsegmental. Asprin changed to apixaban. Also found to have very significant right jugular vein dilation and distention.  vTOS suspected and investigated. Narrowing of jugular behind clavicle, post stenotic dilation of SVC found on CT. 
Dynamic ultrasound of arm and neck doesn't fully support vTOS diagnosis. Ultrasound result was just severe jugular vein dilation and distension with no known cause. No source of clots found on ultrasound of legs, arm or neck. 

Eosinophils high for the last 6 months since this all started but forms of vasculitis seem to be ruled out through bloods. 

But the main question I have is - if it's not FMD now that my problems have jumped to venous system too or any sort of vasculitis - do you have any other ideas on things that could impact both veins and arteries?

Part I.,"It had been exactly three weeks since I’d moved out of Claudia’s apartment and into this crumbling, half-condemned corner of Los Angeles. The kind of neighborhood people warned you about on online forums and true crime podcasts. Stray dogs howled at night. Power flickered if you dared to microwave something. The streets had more cracks than pavement, and the buildings leaned like they were whispering secrets to each other.

But no matter how hostile or decayed this place felt, it was still safer than where I came from.

We were supposed to start a new life here. Me and Claudia. A life in California, under big skies and second chances.

It’s not something I talk about because who would believe a 5’10 man over a 5’1 woman?

She didn’t hurt me with fists. It was all with words—meticulously cruel ones. She had a gift for it. A scalpel for a tongue. She called it “just being honest,” but honesty doesn’t leave you crying in parking lots, questioning your entire worth.

Claudia humiliated me every chance she got. She weaponized my vulnerabilities, the ones I gave her willingly, lovingly. She called me pathetic in front of her friends. She laughed at me in text threads she forgot to hide. And when I tried to leave, she got worse. Spiteful. Vindictive. She emptied my bank account under the excuse of needing money for her singing career, which never took off. Because let’s face it, the woman has about as much discipline as a wet sock.

Now I am here. Three weeks in. Barely surviving.

The only thing holding me together was the tiny gym in the basement of my crumbling apartment complex. The weights were rusty, the air was stale, and the mirrors warped. Strangely, there was a considerable number of weights. And there was enough weights here to complete my circuits. Since I couldn’t afford BJJ classes, lifting plates and doing reps was all I could do against the creeping madness of being twenty-four, broke, and completely alone.

I had nothing to show for anything but an associates degree and an academic dismissal record from UCLA, another one of Claudia’s many legacies. I had done well in community college back home in Florida, getting high marks. But all of that was over now.

As I finished my final overhead press, a deep tremor shook the building. The plates on the rack rattled like teeth. It was the third one that week. They had to be earthquakes. This city was after all sitting on the San Andreas fault.

The scientists on the news speculated it was subsidence. That they were “shifting fault lines,” they and “underground instability due to water tables.” But these tremors felt too light, too sporadic, and too deliberate to be natural.

Squishy, writhing sounds were reported to have been heard along with the tremors by utility workers both on the surface and below ground. There were whispers of shadows moving in sinkholes, of screeching that didn’t sound human. But nothing was verified.

Before I could contemplate any of this further, I heard the door open.

I looked over and saw tanned skin, twin braids, black yoga shorts and a burgundy sports bra that framed her like she was carved from marble. Her eyes were soft but alert, deer-like. Her body was chiseled and toned, like that of a CrossFit instructor. Abs were slightly visible on her midriff.

She didn’t notice me as she walked past with her air pods in, stretching absently. As I moved through my circuit, I caught her reflection in the warped mirrors and caught her glancing at me too.

Thirty minutes later, I was done. As I made for the door, I passed one last mirror.

Our eyes locked. I then caught a ghost of a smile as I glanced into the mirror.  Was that directed at me? I didn’t see anyone else besides the two of us in that tiny gym.

I didn’t think too much of it as I hauled myself back up the stairs and let myself into my apartment, muscles sore from all the weightlifting. The next morning, I was up early. Not that I could sleep very well, let alone need an alarm clock. The nightmares did a better job waking me up.

The tremors continued, still not showing patterns typical to earthquakes. They came in pulses, like breathing. Like something under us was stretching, waking up.

A baby’s cry jolted me upright. The sound came from outside my apartment.

I stepped out onto the narrow balcony. And there she was. The CrossFit lady from last night.

She sat on the porch next to mine, holding a softly crying baby close to her chest. No makeup now. Just sweatpants, a faded tank top, and those same braids trailing down her shoulders. Her tattoos were more visible now: a winding snake disappearing under the waistband of her pants, a mandala design on her shoulder, and just beneath her collarbone, a compass inked in black.

We locked eyes.

I braced for the usual gestures I get from girls. The eyerolls, turn aways, maybe a muttered “what are you looking at?” as they glared at me.

But I was stunned when she smiled at me. Her expression was warm and welcoming. Her nose piercing glistened in the dawning light. She raised her tiny hand in a gentle wave.

“Hi,” she chirped with a slight pink hue washing over her cheeks.

I blinked, returning a crooked smile while waving back awkwardly. “H-hey.”

“You new around here?” she asked, voice low, almost lyrical. She sounded American, but something in her tone hinted at roots further south.

“S-somewhat.”

She held my gaze, and her smirk. “Me too. Moved in two days ago.”

Her phone slipped from her pocket. “Ugh.” She leaned over to grab it, and I caught another tattoo along her spine. It was some kind of text. Foreign. Faded. Like a scar she made beautiful.

The ground trembled again—more forcefully this time. A soft *crack* echoed nearby. Somewhere close, maybe beneath us, something shifted.

She flinched. Just slightly.

“You feel that?” I asked.

She nodded slowly. “Yeah. I have.” She said slightly rocking her baby.

We stood there in silence; the air was tight with a hint of unease.

I rubbed the back of my neck and adjusted my tie. “Please excuse me. But I must get going.”

Her mouth curved into a wider smile, teeth glistening in the light. “Have a good day, Papi.”

I nervously glanced back and peeped a silent thanks as I walked away. I felt my cheeks flush a dark shade of red. If she called me Papi one more time, I swear I was going to melt into a gooey puddle on the floor. I walked to work like I always did. Four miles through a city that seemed to sag more with every step. The sidewalks had new cracks. Light poles leaned slightly further. Somewhere in the distance, I saw a patch of sidewalk that seemingly dipped into the ground.

A city utility truck was parked next to it, but no one was working. The cones had just been haphazardly placed there seemingly without thought. The caution tape attached nearby was fluttering like poorly poled flags.

I didn’t stop. I never did. When your life is unraveling, the best you can do is keep moving forward and pretend you’re still part of the world.

My job was at a massive, two-story building on the edge of the industrial district. It was a plain, mostly windowless two-story building located at the middle of assfuck metropolitan nowhere. The building is made of faded stucco and industrial concrete. It was designed more like a prison than a place where people worked eight hours a day.

From the outside, it looked like a cheaply built, square-shaped building with brutalist architecture. But inside, it was a labyrinth of cubicles stretching into fluorescent infinity. Dozens upon dozens of people sat in their little gray pens, their voices rising and falling like radio static as they answered calls, took complaints, and tried not to scream.

Thank God I didn’t work on the phones. I had my associate’s degree, which meant I was just qualified enough to be buried under spreadsheets instead of voicemails.

The front doors slid open, doors screeching slightly against the floor. I was immediately hit with the scent of burnt coffee and printer toner. The hum of bad lighting and worse ventilation in this makeshift warehouse-like building settled into my bones like it always did. This place didn’t just feel like a prison—it *was* one. A beige coffin they paid us to climb into for eight hours a day.

I remembered what one of the phone reps had once joked that working at a call center is like being in a prison they pay you to be at.

“Bout time you dragged your sorry behind in here, Martin,” chuckled a voice from behind the receptionist's desk.

It was Angela.

The office secretary—and unofficial queen of sarcasm. A short, sharp-tongued African American woman in her twenties with perfect eyeliner, impossibly long nails, and a voice that could cut through drywall. She had a gold tooth that glinted every time she smiled.

“You tryna set a record for ‘most zombies avoided during a morning commute’ or what?” she said, raising one painted brow.

“Maybe.” I muttered, cracking a smile despite myself.

She nodded once. “Mhm. You look like you fought off three sinkholes and a bad haircut on the way here.”

She wasn’t wrong. I nevertheless gave her a mock salute and headed toward the accounting corner. My cubicle was in the back left corner of the building, away from the worst of the call center noise but close enough to hear it leak through the thin walls. The overhead fluorescents buzzed like dying flies.

I sat down at my desk, logged in, and opened my first spreadsheet of the day. Line after line of vendor totals, expenses, revenues, balance reconciliations, and overdue reimbursements. The kind of mindless repetition that blurred the hours and dulled your soul in equal measure. $16.50 an hour. No benefits. No 401(k). Just the soft promise that if I stayed long enough, I might get a .50 cent raise.

My boss, Martha, made her appearance around 9:30 AM. I heard her before I saw her—heels clicking down the linoleum like gunshots. Martha was Jamaican, in her early fifties, with close-cropped hair, brilliant earrings, and a laugh that came out like a punchline to a joke you weren’t sure you wanted to hear. She had a gold tooth like Angela, but hers caught the light like a warning. She had a wicked, dark sense of humor that made some people uncomfortable—but I liked it.

“Martin,” she said, peeking over my cubicle wall like a cat scoping prey. “You still alive?”

“For now,” I muttered, fingers tapping numbly at my keyboard.

“Good. Keep it that way. Dead men don’t process expense reports.”

She laughed to herself and sauntered off, leaving the faint scent of her cocoa butter lotion.

The day dragged on like it always did. Coffee. Data entry. Boring emails. Then more spreadsheets. But sometime around noon, the power flickered. The monitors blinked. The lights overhead dimmed for a heartbeat.

No one said anything. Everyone just froze for a moment. A few of us glanced around the low ceiling and suffocated claustrophobic walls around us, eyes darting around. After a minute or two of eerie stillness, the murmurs and mutterings between friends and coworkers continued as people resumed their calls and activities.

Eight hours later, my shift ended, and I went over to my locker in the common area where you had to surrender your belongings before being let into the facility. I took out my bag and changed out of my work clothes into athletic wear. I immediately hit the streets and began my two-mile walk; I wanted to get home before sunset.

As I proceeded down the street, I walked up a rather steep ramp that had a view of both the overpass, along with the beach and the green hills just below the horizon. As I passed by one intersection, my eyes twitched slightly at the sight of what I was seeing as my eyes scanned the horizon below. The homeless camps looked as if they were bunched further together, as if they were somehow being pushed together.

It was subtle. The kind of change you'd only notice if you saw the place every day like I did. Tents that once stood apart now pressed shoulder to shoulder, like frightened animals. And where there had once been trash fires and voices, there was now silence and smoke that curled in tight spirals.

I stopped walking. Something about it gnawed at the back of my brain. Then the ground beneath me *twitched*.

Not a quake. Not the full-body shake of tectonic plates rubbing together. This was sharper. Quicker. Like something huge had just *moved* underneath the concrete—shifted its weight and went still again.

I looked around. A few cars passed by on the overpass above, indifferent. A cyclist swerved wide to avoid a pothole and didn’t even flinch. I rubbed my eyes. Maybe I was tired. Maybe my brain was trying to make sense of the caffeine crash and the flickering lights from earlier.

As I kept walking, the sky was melted into a deep orange, then red, the kind of sunset that looked like the world had been dipped in fire. Shadows stretched out in strange ways—longer than they should’ve, curling and jagged, bending against the grain of the buildings.

I treaded up the sidewalk, the soles of my sneakers tapping softly against the cracked concrete. The sun had nearly dipped behind the hills, bleeding amber and violet across the sky like bruises. The air smelled faintly of salt, sweat, and ozone.

And once more—I saw her. The Hispanic woman from the gym.

She was coming down the slope toward the apartment complex, her hands lightly gripping the handles of a black stroller. Her infant daughter was bundled inside, tiny fists rising and falling as she dozed.

She wore yoga shorts and a fitted sports bra, her figure lean and powerful, like someone who worked hard for her peace. Her long dark hair was braided into two tight plaits, and her skin glowed golden in the dying light.

She tilted her head just a little, and her mouth curved into a warm, quiet smile. A genuine one. The kind that felt like it didn’t get used enough but hadn’t forgotten how.

“Hey,” she said softly, her smile brightening.

“H-Hey,” I stammered, nearly tripping on a raised section of sidewalk.

“Just getting back from work?” she asked.

I nodded. Too hard. “Yeah.”

She didn’t flinch at my awkwardness. Didn’t look away.

“How was your day?”

I forced a smile. Tried to hold myself together like I hadn’t been unraveling all day.

“It was… predictable, I guess.”

She let out a small laugh. It was light and real and made something flicker in my chest I didn’t want to name.

“Predictable means stable,” she said with a ghost of a smile tugging at her lips.

“I-I-I…” I rubbed the back of my neck, heat crawling into my cheeks. Jesus. Me and my neurodivergent slow brain. Hesitating, flailing, stammering like a car with octagon wheels,

She tilted her head again, studying me. Not with judgment, but curiosity. Like she was waiting for me to catch up to myself.

“I should get going,” I said. I didn’t mean it, not really. I just didn’t know how to handle standing in front of a woman who looked like she walked off the cover of Vogue and spoke to me like I was worth her time. But instead of brushing it off or saying goodnight, she looked at me and asked looking up at me with a pouty lip and puppy eyes: “Do you want to walk with me?”

I blinked. The baby stirred slightly in the stroller.

My brain tripped over itself, repeating old advice: *Don’t date single moms. It’s complicated. You’re not ready. She’s out of your league.*

Then, the voice that had been whispering in my ear for months—*You’re broken, no one wants you, you’re not enough*—suddenly fell silent.

“...S-sure,” I said.

Her smile returned, cheekbones pressed higher on her face. She turned, and I fell in beside her.

The sidewalk curved gently toward the complex, and as we walked, I noticed how quiet the evening was. No dogs barking. No traffic. No laughter from the playground up the block. Just the crunch of gravel beneath our feet, and the low creak of the stroller wheels.

“So… what do you do?” she asked.

“I’m in accounting,” I said. “At a call center. Not glamorous. What about you?”

“I work full time at a warehouse. I’m a supervisor.” she said.

I nodded. “You seem like you’re… good at it.”

“I try.” She looked down at her daughter with a quiet affection. “She’s my ‘why.’”

There was a silence after that, but not a bad one. A soft one.

Then, just as we reached the gate of the complex, the ground beneath us gave a sudden, short *jolt*. The stroller’s wheels bounced slightly. I reached out instinctively, steadying it before it could tip.

Her eyes darted to me. “Another one?”

“Yeah…” I said slowly. “Felt that one under my feet.”

“That’s the third time this week.”

“It’s weird. Doesn’t feel like earthquakes. More like… movement.”

We both turned and looked back toward the hill, toward the horizon where the last sliver of sun dipped beneath the horizon.

And for just a second, I thought I saw something *shift* in the asphalt far up the road. Like the street itself had *breathed*. Her hand tightened slightly on the stroller.

We sat on an old wooden bench near the entrance to the apartment courtyard, just beyond the iron gate that never quite latched right. The stroller was parked beside us, the baby asleep and swaddled in a soft yellow blanket, her breathing slow and even.

The air had cooled just enough to raise goosebumps, the pavement still radiating the day's heat in long, tired exhales. Above us, the sky had gone a shade darker, stars struggling to break through the haze of city light. She leaned back on the bench, braids falling over her shoulders. She then tilted her face to the sky like someone trying to remember what peace felt like.

“My name’s Rosa,”

“Martin.”

She let off a light toothy smile.

I tilted my head and asked. “Where are you from?”

“I’m from El Salvador,” she began. “My family… they weren’t safe.”

I sat still, letting her speak, Tilting my head slightly.

“My cousin was murdered when I was seventeen. Shot in front of our house by some gang guys. I think it was a message. Something about turf. No one ever explained it, not really.”

My eyes widened slightly.

“A man offered to get me out. Said he would sponsor me. That I could send money home. He made it sound like salvation.”

“But when I got here,” Her lips pursed, and her voice got heavy. “It wasn’t long before they started shuttling me around to various hotels around California. They drugged me, tattooed me, beat me.” I could see the tears coming down her cheeks.

I tilted my head as a breeze moved through the park. The leaves rustled just slightly.

“His name was Diego. He’s MS-13. A shot-caller, I think. Women were like currency to him.” She then looked down at her stroller. “I got pregnant, and he got worse. Possessive. Violent. I left when I was seven months in. Hid in a homeless shelter for weeks.”

I held a hand to my mouth. “God.”

She took a breath, steadied herself. “They helped me file for something called a T visa. For survivors of trafficking. I had to tell them everything. About Diego. About the others. I still get calls from law enforcement sometimes, asking for more names.”

I just stared at her. I didn’t say a word. I didn’t know much about immigration laws. I just knew that many of the workers at the call center spoke broken English and I’m highly confident many were not here legally.

“Those let you stay for four years. After three, you can apply for permanent residency if you’ve cooperated and stayed clean?” I asked.

She nodded. “That, and my daughter was born here.”

Another silence passed, this one thicker. Then she turned her gaze to me. “What about you?”

I shifted on the bench. “What about me?”

“What are *you* running from?”

I frowned and furrowed my eyebrows. “Her name was Claudia. She… she said a lot of things. Most of them stuck.”

I stared down at my hands. The words came slowly in a tone that was laced with both sorrow and grief. “She’d call me names. Said I was broken. That I wasn’t enough. That no one would ever want me. Said I was too weird. Too robotic. That my voice made her want to scream. She used to make fun of the way I stim. Or the way I go quiet when there’s too much noise.”

Rosa’s jaw dropped slightly.

“She said I was on the spectrum and that no one would love someone like that. Like me.”

Rosa tilted her head, raising an eyebrow. “L-like you? On the spectrum?”

I let off a deep sigh. “I’m … on the spectrum.”

“That explains a few things. So let me guess, she weaponized it?” Rosa said, her voice a blade.

“Yeah. But I thought it was love, so I stayed. I kept trying to be better. Quieter. Less… me.”

Rosa reached out and touched my hand. Her fingers were rough with calluses but gentle. I looked over to her and we locked eyes. She wore no makeup, eyeliner, or blush, not that she needed it. God, this woman was gorgeous. I just stared at her, feeling her hand on mine. I then placed my hand on hers. Rosa’s smile grew wide and glistening.

The ground beneath us tremored slightly. We both looked around frantically. Rosa held onto the stroller a little more tightly.

I shook my head. “I'm no geologist, but that didn’t feel like an earthquake.”

She took her hand off mine and held it to her head. “I-I have a lot of laundry to do. I need to get going. Ill see you later!”

“Hey wait!”

She looked back at me, grip maintained on the stroller.

“I actually have laundry to do to. Would it be okay if…” I struggled to get the words out.

Her frown quickly turned into a smirk. “Join me? While doing laundry?” she then laughed.

I felt my cheeks flush. “Forget it. It was a dumb ques-”

“No, it’s okay. It can get pretty lonely at the laundromat. I could use the company.” She said with a glistening grin.

Later that evening, we both went to the laundromat. We both had a large stack of clothes we needed to take care of. The TV in the complex laundromat window glowed blue through the entire room. We were both loading up laundry into the machine.

Just then, a breaking news banner crawled across the bottom of the screen.

**""Violence in South L.A. linked to suspected MS-13 resurgence—multiple stabbings, one missing person, bodies found near riverbed.""**

Rosa turned her attention away from the thong, and me. Her eyes locked onto the screen, her lips pressed into a thin line.

Her voice was quiet. Controlled. “They’re moving again.”

I looked at her. “You think it’s Diego?”

She didn’t answer right away. “It could be him. Or someone he knows. If he knows where I am...”

I saw it. Just for a second. The crack in her armor.

We stood there under the flickering laundromat light, the hum of bad wiring vibrating faintly in the silence. Then she turned to me, her expression different now. Measured, careful.

“Would you... feel comfortable staying with me tonight?”

My brain stuttered. “Wh-what?”

She rubbed her arm. “If you, you wouldn’t mind. Its just… so I can feel safe.”

I stood there and stared at her for what felt like hours. The memories crept inside my head like a parasitic amoeba.

“Martin?” she tilted her head. “Are you alright?”

I shook my head. “Y-yeah I’m fine. Are you sure you’re okay with that? I-I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable.”

She giggled. “I’ll be fine. I don’t bite.”

She gave a small nod and motioned toward the stairwell. We moved quietly, the creaking of the old stairs somehow louder in the dark. When we reached her apartment, she unlocked the door, nudged it open, and stepped aside for me. It was small but clean. The baby was still asleep in her stroller. Rosa gently lifted her into a small bassinet tucked in the corner of the bedroom.

“You can set your stuff down anywhere,” she said, slipping off her sandals.

I hovered awkwardly just inside the doorway, my eyes flicking to the bed. It was modest, with a thick comforter and a small lamp on the nightstand.

“Do you...” Rosa said slowly, turning toward me, “feel okay sharing the bed?”

I hesitated. “I—I’ve never done that before.”

She blinked. “You’ve never shared a bed with a girl?”

I shook my head. “I mean... I’ve dated. But I was always guilted into sleeping on the couch. She said I breathed too loud.""

Rosa stared at me for a long moment, her face unreadable.

“She made me feel like a parasite,” I added quietly. “Even when I wasn’t doing anything wrong.”

She looked like she wanted to say something but didn’t. Instead, she came from the other room after setting Sofia in her crib. She climbed into her side of the bed. “There’s space,” she said, patting the spot next to her.

I stood frozen for a second longer, then moved slowly, sitting on the edge of the mattress like it might give out under me. I kicked off my shoes and lay back stiffly, arms crossed over my chest like a mummy. Rosa wrapped her arm around me, snuggling up to me closely, burying her face in my neck.

The ceiling was dim. My breath was too loud in my ears. I could feel Rosa, however, soundlessly giggling and smiling into my neck.

Then, the flashbacks came.

*“You’re just... so needy all the time, Martin. It’s exhausting.”*

*“Do you even know how to be normal? Like, just for a day?”*

*“You should be grateful someone like me even talks to you.”*

My jaw clenched. I felt like I was underwater again, drowning in the echoes.

I blinked and saw Claudia’s face in my mind, twisted with scorn. The smell of wine on her breath. The way she used to smile *after* the cruelty.

“Martin?”

Rosa’s voice pulled me back, but I didn’t answer right away.

I was still there—on that couch, arms wrapped around my knees, hoping silence would make the yelling stop.

“Martin,” she said again, softer this time. Her hand gently touched my arm. I flinched.

“Sorry.” I breathed, moving to the edge of the bed, back facing her.

“Sorry? For what?” she asked, lying towards me.

I pressed my fingers to my temples. “I-I-I-” I couldn’t get the words out.

“It’s okay. It will be okay.” She said tightening herself to me like a koala bear. “Just hold me please.”

I sighed and turned around to face her. Slowly. We lay there for a while in silence, both of us lying there, eyes closed, lights off. A distant siren echoed, and underneath it...A *low* rumble. Deep. Faint. Like something was dragging itself slowly beneath the city’s skin. Neither of us spoke. But we both heard it.

She gently pushed me onto the bed. I swallowed hard and adjusted myself accordingly. She slid next to me and clambered onto me like a koala bear, burying her face in my neck. I could feel her breathing into me as she giggled.

The next morning, the sky was chalky, bruised yellow. I gingerly let myself out the door, glancing over my shoulder at a sleeping Rosa, and then over to the nursery where baby Isabella was. I carefully walked down the uneven stairs of the apartment complex, trying not to wake the baby.

“Please come home.” I faintly heard her mutter under her breath as I left the room.

But upon traversing onto the street, my eyes set upon the streets before me, and a creeping dread settled into my gut.

The roads, tarmac and pavement before me warped like old skin, looking a lot more disjointed than they did yesterday. Cracks widened overnight, becoming jagged, dark, and *wet*. The asphalt peeled back in long, curling strips like snakeskin. Trash cans, mailboxes and other utilities lay toppled over. Their contents spilled over onto the streets or otherwise half-swallowed by shallow depressions and potholes in the ground. Pigeons, crows and other birds picked at food wrappers, then flew back into the sky. As the familiarity of my surroundings settled into my senses, a cold dread settled into my gut as the realization about my usual route fell upon me like a ten-ton anvil.

**There were sinkholes, everywhere. A lot more than yesterday.**

But three of them had appeared near the bus stop I normally passed, gaping like open mouths.  
One was filled with murky water while the other two were just dark. But the most unsettling thing about the area was that there were no signs, no cones, or indeed, the presence of very many utility workers. There was just spray paint on the concrete in orange that read “TEMP CLOSED” in a rush-job scrawl. I nevertheless resumed my walk to the call center, treading carefully along the pavement.

I arrived at the call center a half hour later.

Security gates didn’t buzz open anymore; they were just left ajar. I just walked on by. I immediately noticed the parking lot only had a fifth of the automobiles that were normally there. When I entered, the fluorescents inside flickered like the pulse of something sick. It was hot, scorching hot, like the air conditioning stopped working. It was like walking into an oversized oven.

It also felt eerie. Namely because there was no good reason to miss work or school today. There were no incoming natural disasters or orders from the state government to evacuate. Yet people were seemingly bolting without permission from anyone. I didn’t even need to swipe my badge to get in. The call center’s main lobby, normally buzzing with noise, energy and life, today was empty.

There was no receptionist. No coffee machine hum. No quiet morning chatter. Just silence.

I made my way to the second floor where most of the windows were. The overhead lights buzzed faintly. Only a few desks were occupied, scattered like survivors. Of the forty or so people who normally made up the floor, I counted **less than ten.** And close to all of them were not their usual selves. Even the loud, cheerful ones looked haunted.

I noticed one woman with pale, sunken eyes. Another woman was visibly shaking, hands wrapped around a Styrofoam cup that had long since stopped steaming as she stared mindlessly at her screen.

I passed by Mitch from sales. Normally boisterous and rowdy what being he was in sales. Always showing off sports stats. Today, he stared at his screen like it was the edge of a cliff.

“Mitch?” I asked.

He glanced up at me, then his attention went back to the screen.

“You hear about Greta?”

I shook my head.

“She saw the ground swallow a whole house. Right near her condo. She said she could hear people screaming, but there was nothing she could do. The road looked like soup. She quit. Took off last night without even a notice. She didn’t even pack her stuff.”

He turned to me, slowly. His eyes were *red*. Not just tired—bloodshot and threaded like something had broken in him.

“This place… it’s not safe anymore. Not this city. Not this building. You feel it?”

I nodded. It was becoming painfully obvious.

Later that morning, I passed by the security desk again. The guard—Camilla, a usually chipper girl—was slumped forward in her chair, watching grainy camera feeds twitch with static.

I asked her about the missing people. About the roadblocks, and the sinkholes. She didn’t answer at first. Just kept watching the feed.

Then, without looking at me, she said: “We can’t stay here.”

I blinked. “What?”

She finally looked at me. Her eyes were *too dry.* Like she hadn’t blinked in hours. She turned back to the monitors.

“Get out while you can.” She said in a low, yet unassuming voice. “Tomorrow. Preferably tonight.”

I shook my head. “The paychecks get processed tomorrow.”

She glanced over at me, expression hardened as he slowly shook his head. “Another hundred dollars doesn’t mean shit when you’re dead. I know what I’m doing. Mama lives in Nevada.”

I didn’t pay too much heed. I just went over to my desk and resumed my duties as usual. I was busy as usual. But I noticed that new work was not coming down the pipeline and into my inbox. My boss wasn’t looking over my shoulder or sending me emails like she normally did. Indeed, I haven’t run into her at all since I came in this morning.

Before I knew it, it was five. I clocked out and headed out the door. The security guard I passed earlier wasn’t there, and the building felt even more empty than this morning. It was so quiet I could hear my own voice bounce off the walls. I felt the ground below me lightly shake, but it was followed by a slithering, writhing sound. The rumbling intensified.

The lights then went out. It took me about a half a second to register that the power just went out.

I then heard loud crashing sounds coming from outside.

The automatic door was jammed, and I had to force it open. As I stepped outside into the midday sun, I came into a parking lot that was now completely empty. This was when I got the emergency alert on my phone:

UNUSUAL SEISMIC ACTIVITY DETECTED! TAKE SHELTER! EVACUATE IF POSSIBLE!

My heart fell in my chest as I witnessed the two-story building next to ours collapse into the ground, falling into a massive sinkhole. Cement crumbled inward like paper. A cloud of **dust and screams** billowed into the air. And through it – I heard it.

**The writhing, and the wet slapping. The friction of something unnatural squeezing through bedrock, coming from directly below. It had to be massive.**

I didn’t need a second invitation. I quickly made my way out of the plaza and onto the main road. I normally took an hour to get home, but I was determined to reach Rosa, so I decided to move as fast as I could.

I got another buzz on my phone. Another emergency alert? Maybe it was Rosa?! I took it out of my pocket to check for any possible updates. But I was surprised to see who it was.

“Hey! Martin? It’s Claudia. I heard the reports and wanted to know if you were doing alright! Are you still in Los Angeles? Are you alright? Are you safe? Please let me know! I worry so much about you.”

Unbelievable. It was Claudia. Now of all times she decides to reach out to me? After three months of total silence? I sighed deeply, looking down at the text, completely dumbfounded. I regardless ignored it and phoned Rosa.

She picked up—*thank God*—but she was already mid-sentence, voice frantic.

“Martin—it’s a madhouse here. I don’t know what’s happening. People are—”

*“What? Rosa, slow down—”*

“A car just sank outside. *It was just parked*, and the whole street opened like a zipper, and-”

**I then heard a scream from her end of the line.** It was a raw, **soul-ripping sound** that made my blood run cold.

“SOMETHINGS DOWN HERE! IT’S-”

The call cut off. And what followed was an eerie, unsettling silence. I shook my head and made my way onto the tarmac.

Then it burst through the road before me. Chunks of asphalt flew like thrown bricks and debris. And from the earth rose **what I could only describe as a grotesque splice of giant earthworm, tapeworm and leech.** **It was a massive, fleshy, annelid. The best image that comes to mind is that of the sandworms from Dune, the graboids from Tremors and the carnictus from King Kong**

**It was covered in slime and glistening mucus. It was as long as a charter bus. Its maw was lined with spiraling, grinding teeth. It had no eyes, just a large, gaping, open mouth aligned with razor-sharp teeth, wide enough to look like it could swallow a car whole.**

**It was writhing slowly through the air.** It reared up from the street with a screech like tearing metal, flailing about like a baby bird clamoring for food. The creature then **slid back down** into the road, tunneling **just below the next building.** The sidewalk connected to it cracked like glass.

**Then it hit me. There were little to no sinkholes at the foot of the buildings laden on solid cement. I deduced the giant worms couldn’t break through the concrete foundation.** But the **tarmac**?

The **roads**? The **sidewalks**? Or even the tarmac? **They were risky.**

I moved around the building to the side exit, across the narrow strip of cement walkway.  
**Not the road.**  At that point, I wasn’t walking anymore, I was running or otherwise jogging towards the apartment, being extra careful to avoid the more brittle and fragile parts of the road.

I was exhausted by the time I finally reached the apartment half an hour later, careful to avoid the roads and tarmac, practically sprinting from building to building.

The door was ajar, and a chill ran down my spine. Knowing what I knew about Rosa, it wasn’t like her leaving the door open like that. It was too quiet. I heard nothing coming from the apartment. No baby cries. I heard no humming either. The light was on but barely. I couldn’t see anything through the closed blinds.

The door creaked faintly as I nudged it open with my foot. Inside, the lights were dim—barely flickering from a loose ceiling fixture, casting everything in sickly yellow hues. Something wasn’t right. Of the handful of times, I’ve been here, it’s never been this eerily quiet. The fact that the door wasn’t even closed furthered my unease.

“Rosa?” I called softly.

“Martin?” Came her voice. But she didn’t sound like her sprightly self.  It was flat. Measured. Like someone reading from a script. **Her tone was off**. No trembling, no relief, no panic. The tone was far too calm considering the circumstances.

I stepped inside cautiously, trying not to make a sound on the creaking laminate floor.

She was kneeling in the living room. Rigid. Shoulders high. Her eyes met mine, wide and glassy, like a trapped animal. Her lips mouthed “you came,” but her eyes were pleading with me not to take another step forward.

That’s when I heard a gun cocking and something cold being pressed to the back of my head.

How can I get rid of the stench?,"My roommate likes to meal prep all her food on the weekends, which means she cooks large amounts of food, leaving LARGE amounts of odors that make the entire apartment smell and linger. I do think the weather being hot has made this problem significantly worse, as I haven't had many issues during the colder months. But at this point I feel like I am all out of options. I am annoyed beyond belief. The last two months have been really frustrating because she will prep her food on the weekend, and the day she cooks, the entire apartment will smell strongly of her food. The odor will even reach my room and make my bedroom smell like shit. The smell is strong for about a day (I have been able to clear out the initial stink within 24 hours by airing out the apartment and having fans/AC run pretty much nonstop). But my issue right now is that the odors attach onto the apartment. I am not sure where or what, but the smell lingers. I try my best to keep my bedroom smelling like vanilla, but when I leave my room or the apartment, then come back (when I am not nose blind to the smells), I smell her cooking. I smell her food when I am in the bathroom, taking a shower. I smell it lingering in our kitchen/living room. We have a small apartment so it's not hard for the cooking smells to reach every corner of the place. But what I am worried about is the natural smell of our apartment becoming her cooking. I can smell it. And it's even latching onto my stuff. If I leave my room while she's cooking, even for a few minutes, my clothes will smell like her food. My belongings have a smell (blankets, backpack, clothes, etc.) I even had to scrub my water bottle with baking soda because of it. That's where I draw the line. It was okay during the colder months because the smell would go away after a day and I wouldn't notice it again. But during the summer, the smell has latched onto my belongings. And it's like nothing I try works. I've had our windows open, AC and fans running, and now an air purifier (which I worry will jack up our electricity bill). I've boiled water/white vinegar, I have tried scrubbing the counters, walls, and mopped with white vinegar and water. I have laid out bowls of coffee grounds too. I even bought Ozium which I was told was supposed to eliminate the odors in the air, but it doesn't. I feel like I am out of options? What I need help with, is where are these odors attaching itself to, and what can I do to neutralize them? She cooks chicken, veggies, etc with a lot of cooking oil/seasonings. I am not sure where they are sticking to and what I can do to keep the apartment smelling neutral? I am very sensitive and picky with smells and how I smell. I don't want to smell like food. I don't think it is fair for me and my things to be affected. I also don't want to deep clean the apartment every damn week since she does this every week. I am thinking about talking with her about this issue, but I don't know exactly how to do it in a respectful way. I cannot ask her to simply not cook? I am not sure if there is a middle ground or if there's anything she can do to help reduce the smells because it seems like everything I try is no match to how strong the odors are. Also I feel like I have had to talk with her and set boundaries with her on so many other things, and there are so many more things I want to talk to her about too, so I am not sure how to bring up these concerns without it seeming like I am constantly attacking her for being a shitty roommate (which to be fair she is, I am constantly cleaning up after her mindless behavior). Idk if I sound unreasonable or like an asshole but I cannot express how tired and angry I am of dealing with this. If anyone here has any suggestions or solutions, please share. I don't know if I will just have to wait it out until the weather gets colder or if there's a way to deep clean the apartment and get rid of all these odors.

My friend just got married and I’m really happy for her. She had told me initially she was going to have her wedding later in the year and that I was invited to that. To provide context, this would be a combination of a religious ceremony and then a reception, spread over only 1 day. 
Cut to more recently, I asked her if she wanted to go for some coffee and just hang out as we do sometimes. She replied stating that she would have loved to but she was actually really busy at that time as she was having her religious ceremony that same week I’d messaged her. The reason she gave was that as her parent was severely unwell (which they are - having a serious health issue) they wanted to get married before their parent went for an operation, and that they would still have the reception in a few months. I didn’t ask if i was invited or not as that is just not me, instead I wished her the best for her day. I had assumed that it would have been family only due to the urgency of the situation. 
So then I see that one of our mutual friends had actually been at the marriage ceremony. 
I feel quite hurt. I’m not asking for sympathy. 
I thought we were quite close, but maybe I was misjudged in thinking this. Again I’m really happy for her, I just wish I was able to celebrate with her. 
Has anyone been through this before and if so, how did you go about it?? Am I being too sensitive?

First post here, super nervous. I'm a student, recently gave up recruiting for internships + dropped a few classes to build a startup for the first time and just started doing sales after the fun part of building the MVP. Would love to share some wins and losses!

**WINS:**

* 130k+ views on Reddit, 100+ leads, I 6-7 a few to 1:1s 👀
* 2 Linkedin campaigns launched, \~10% response rate, converted a few connections to 1:1s!
* Over 20k+ impressions on LinkedIn! And finally hit 1k followers on LinkedIn!
* 200+ cold emails sent
* VC cold messaged us on LinkedIn asking for a chat
* Z Fellows application submitted

**LOSSES:**

* 0% response rate on email
* <100 views on X/Twitter over 1 week
* BLOCKED by 2 directors and a VP that I cold messaged on LinkedIn
* My dad told me to stop taking calls at 1AM b/c I don't need to spend this much time on my startup 🫠

**What I learned in my first week of sales:**

* don't include links in the first message EVER. no demo, no meeting link, nothing. just text with value
* bribe people with food, offer to buy them coffee/donuts for a chat (works best for people around the same age, or if you're playing into student charm)
* post, post and post publicly. I don't think I would have gotten a meeting with a VC if I didn't blast embarrassing but authentic content

The book grew out of my own journey as a career woman, mom, and wife who was juggling everything — career, family, home, even trying to find time for myself. I realized I was burning out. What changed things for me was building a system around gratitude and structure — giving myself permission to rest while still pursuing my goals with intention.

That became the foundation of The TY System™: a philosophy of “soft girl ambition,” where you don’t have to choose between success and serenity.

Inside, I share stories of how I went from burnout to balance, how I use affirmations in my morning routine (yes, I keep an affirmation calendar next to my coffee maker), and the mindset shifts that helped me stop glorifying the hustle and start prioritizing peace.

I know a lot of us struggle with this balance, and if even one person reads my book and feels a little more grounded, it will have been worth it.

First time posting here, I need advice. I am wanting to try a past life regression for the first time. It's something I wanted to do for a while and I think I'm finally ready. I've had a lot of trauma in this life and don't typically engage in activities that can trigger a PTSD response from me.


My question concerns a specific fear I have in this life. As long as I can remember, with the earliest memory being when I was a toddler, I've been _terrified_ of sharks. My entire life I've had very vivid nightmares of being attacked by a large shark, feeling pain and fear, seeing my blood in the water, waking up with tears streaming down my face. I'm a single parent and once or twice a month I wake my kids up because I'm apparently screaming in my sleep. I awake to the worried faces of my kids who have been shaking me to wake me up. It's awful and I feel so ashamed and concerned that my kids worry like this, but I haven't been able to stop the dreams.


When I see a shark unexpectedly while consuming media (browsing online, watching TV, etc.) I have an automatic response that I cannot control and typically have no awareness of my actions until afterward (i.e. a very ""normal"" PTSD response). The response consists of fleeing and/or getting on top of the highest object I can (I once apparently managed to clamber to the top of a refrigerator without any recollection of doing so; I've also found myself after the fact on top of the kitchen table, the kitchen counter, the coffee table, and so forth). 


When I was 7 I was crab-walking like a chode through the living room when suddenly a gaping shark maw filled the TV screen just a foot away from me. I think I must have picked my hands up off of the floor mid-crabwalk to wave them in panic or something lol, because I ended up slamming forward onto my face on the hardwood floor and busting my nose.


The point of all this being, I currently don't have anyone who can hang with me while I do a past life regression for the first time. I've always been fascinated by past life possibilities and of course have wondered my whole life whether my weird fear of sharks is due to a past life. That said, I certainly do not want to experience whatever life that might have been. I know that this fear has been with me since I was very young and that I never lived near or even saw an ocean in this life until I was 17, but this really intense fear of sharks has been with me since I can remember.


The fear is so bad that I avoid the water and boats especially (even in lakes which is ridiculous but I'm still just as terrified, and as a rule absolutely NO fun whatsoever during any type of water activities). I can swim in a pool as long as nobody becomes a smart-ass and starts humming the Jaws theme 🙄. If I am inside when a shark suddenly triggers me, I will do anything to get up off of the floor as evidenced by my typical response to the trigger. I honestly can't even discuss sharks while my feet are on any type of terra firma because I have this weird feeling that a shark could come up from below and grab me even when I'm on land. So I think that's why my autonomic response is to jump up on to whatever highest piece of furniture is nearby. 


If I undertake a past life regression hypnosis at home session using a YouTube video that has been recommended to me by friends who have successfully tried it, will I have the ability to avoid any shark-related prior life activities? I absolutely do not want to be alone and find myself stuck in some past life regression where I am being chewed apart by a shark. I know that past life regressions often provide answers, can highlight lingering traumas affecting us in this life and may leave the person experiencing the regression with a deeper sense of self-knowledge and peace. But if the scenario I describe were to happen to me without without my consent or prior awareness/readiness (which may never happen because in 48 years my fears have only gotten worse, even after lots of therapy), I honestly don't know if I would be able to recover from that mentally or emotionally.


I welcome your recommendations and thoughts on the subject as I am very new to all of this despite having thought about it and being very interested in other (non-shark) past life scenarios. Can I avoid any shark-specific past life experiences or am I taking a risk that could happen anyway, regardless of my desire to avoid it?

First post on this sub, and it's ofc asking for setup suggestions. For reference: I was a barista for just over a decade, a trainer for most of that time. I know my way around an espresso machine/dialing in coffee/all coffee equipment/etc, but I havent touched a commercial setup in 6 years, and i'm ready to build my home setup after getting over cafe trauma lmfao.

I'm torn between the baratza esp pro| breville bambino combination, baratza esp pro|gaggia classic pro (i will not be modding my machine's internals, external only lol), orrrrr just getting a breville barista pro for the convenience/ease? I havent been able to find vetted reviews for the baratza esp pro yet, or of the breville barista pro.

I usually drink iced beverages, but I would  like the option to make hot drinks when the mood strikes. I do usually prefer a dark roast. For grinders, I'd prefer not to get the df54 because I make my own cold brew 95% of the time and I don't want to be fiddling with a single dose machine. I also do not want to buy a used machine, just personal preference. Lastly, I don't have a whole lot of counter space & the rest of my coffee setup uses most of what little i do have.

I have a timemore scale already, if that matters? My maximum budget is about 1k total, but id prefer to do under if possible.

Today I was hurting badly, but still had housework to do. I am prescribed 10 mg of Adderall IR for the weekend (I take Vyvanse 10mg during the week) that I spaced out over three doses, taking half of the pill at one time and then quarter pill segments maybe an hour or two later on each.

Due to feeling so beat up today, I was drinking coffee throughout the day to help (I normally drink about 2 to 3 cups of coffee per day).  It began to feel fine and I was doing good getting a laundry done and cleaning up around the bedroom and doing some vacuuming, etc. I wanted to keep going so I took one more quarter of a pill but then I think the coffee and the quarter pill finally hit me together, and now I do not feel so hot. I’m speaking dictation into this post, and even doing this is extremely difficult and tiring, almost like I’m out of breath.

I’ve taken the Adderall IR with coffee before and can’t really say I’ve experienced any issues. I also take Suboxone .50 mg per day. I split that into .25mg pieces twice a day.

I think what I’m feeling is just an overload now of the coffee and the Adderall together, but I’ve never had that feeling before. Could it simply be that my body is now exhausted again after doing so much housework while being sore and having played music so long yesterday?  

I do have a back issue, which gives me trouble, I have a blown disc at L5 S1.  I do have some Flexeril, which I took last night to help assist with the muscle pain, it did an OK job I guess. Would I be safe to take that again later tonight to calm this down?

I was hoping to get a lot done today around the house, but now I am feeling very out of sorts and ungrounded.  Probably anxiety right?

I’ve been drinking water throughout the day and we did eat lunch, so I’ve had food and aren’t just running on an empty stomach.

It’s about 5:30 right now EST, this should subside eventually right?  Anything I can do to help mitigate?  Def never pushing it like this again.  Not a fun feeling.

The scent of lilies filled the house.

It was a smell Karissa Simon had grown to hate. It clung to the curtains, the furniture, her clothes. It was the smell of Hettie Lindsey.

Brady Kennedy walked into the living room, his phone pressed to his ear. He didn't look at Karissa. He never did, not really.

Yes, of course, they're your favorite, he was saying, his voice low and soft, a tone he never used with her. ""The whole house will be full of them.""

Karissa felt her throat tighten. An old, familiar allergy, or maybe something else.

For four years, this house had been her gilded cage. Their marriage was a business merger, a cold transaction designed to save his family's pride and chain her to a man who despised her. She was a ghost here, haunting the grand staircase.

He hung up the phone. The silence that followed was colder than his voice had been.

I need you to sign these, Brady said. He tossed a manila folder onto the marble coffee table. It slid across the polished surface and stopped just at the edge.

Divorce Papers.

The words were printed in stark, black ink at the top of the page.

Karissa stared at them. She'd known this was coming. Ever since Hettie, his childhood sweetheart, had resurfaced two months ago, this moment had been hanging over them, a guillotine waiting to fall.

You got what you wanted, Karissa, he said, his voice flat. ""Your family used this marriage to crush the Kennedys. Now, I'm taking back what's mine. The Simon Group will be my compensation.""

She remembered a different Brady, a boy from her childhood, her brother's best friend, who promised to protect her always. That memory was the foundation of a love so deep it had become her life's sickness.

I won't sign, she said, her voice barely a wh**per.

He finally looked at her. His eyes, the color of a stormy sea, were filled with a familiar, chilling contempt.

Don't be pathetic. Hettie is back. She's carrying my child.

Each word was a hammer blow.

Karissa's hand went to her stomach. A desperate, foolish plan had formed in her mind over the last few sleepless nights. A last-ditch lie.

I'm pr**nant too, Brady.

He laughed. It was a short, ugly sound.

Do you think I'm a fool? We haven't shared a bed in three years. Stop this disgusting charade. You've always been a liar.

He picked up a vase of the freshly delivered lilies, inhaling their scent deeply, a smile touching his lips for the first time that evening. It was a smile for another woman.

That was the moment something inside her finally broke. The last thread of hope she had been clinging to for four years, for her entire life, snapped.

The pain in her ch**t was sharp, a physical ache the doctors had warned her about. She knew she didn't have much time left.

But he would never know that.

She would not be his burden. She would not be the reason he was pitied, the widower of a woman he never loved.

If he wanted freedom, she would give it to him.

All of it.

She walked to the table, picked up a pen, and signed her name on the divorce papers. Her hand was steady.

Then she picked up her phone. She scrolled to a number she hadn't called in months. Her lawyer, Darcy Dodson.

Darcy, Karissa said, her voice clear and calm. ""Prepare the paperwork. I'm transferring all of my shares in the Simon Group to Brady Kennedy.""

Karissa, what? Are you insane? After everything he's done?

It's a condition of the divorce, Karissa lied smoothly. ""Just do it. And make it effective immediately.""

She hung up before Darcy could argue.

She looked at Brady. He was staring at her, a flicker of surprise in his cold eyes. He hadn't expected it to be this easy.

She had given him everything. Her love, her youth, her company. And now, her future.

It was the only way to truly set him free. And herself.",2,1756071373.0,novelsfree,1,1.0,False

Can I call her mom to come pick her up?,"Hi everyone. For context, my roommate (we'll call her J) and I have been friends since high school. I'm very close with her family and went to high school with J's sister, L, as well. J and L no longer talk for reasons related to my issue with her. We also have mutual friends that also no longer talk to J for similar reasons. 

J has BPD and a whole slew of self-diagnosed illnesses. We've always understood each other and bonded over our mental illnesses because I have a mixed bag too, diagnosed but still; sometimes when you know, you know. However, I think these diagnoses make J feel as if she's absolved from any ownership of her own actions. She tends to blow up over small things and make her uncomfortable reaction everyone else's problem. 

Here's the issue. We moved in together this past May and already, our friendship is strained. Not for typical issues friends have when living together though, nothing like dishes piling (they are), trash accumulating (it is), or messes going unattended (they do); the issue is that I don't spend enough time with J.

Before we lived together, J and I could go weeks or even months without checking in. I'm not a social person and tend to spend a lot of time alone, and J knows this because I would often cancel plans (as would she) if I simply wasn't feeling social. Never was this an issue before. Now, we live together, and she gets mad when I don't come downstairs before she leaves for work or sit and chat over coffee every morning even if I'm running late. I'm constantly bombarded by small talk and every tiny detail of J's day, and it's usually when I'm trying to focus on something or take care of my almost 3yo son. She's just very needy.

This morning, my son didn't wake up until 6 and was just quietly playing in his room. I decided to wait until he needed me to get up, so I played some games on my computer (a very rare occasion). After maybe an hour, I get my son dressed and we go downstairs where J is sitting on the couch. I say good morning cheerfully, as I'm actually having a good day and managed to cram some me-time into my busy life as a single mom and full time employee. J responds very quickly and shortly, sort of snapping back. I ask if she's ok, to which she said ""no, but it doesn't matter.""

Eventually I'm able to get her to open up to me about what's wrong, and it's the same issue it's been since we moved in together over 3 months ago. I don't spend enough time with her. I should've smelled the cinnamon buns cooking and hurried downstairs to eat and chat before she left for work. She started crying and said she shouldn't have to feel so unwelcome in her own home.

1mz80fw,https://i.redd.it/b8l90yl1c1lf1.jpeg,"18-year-old Carolyn Pruyser last seen at Peace River service station (May 17, 1984) — her car found abandoned on Kaufman Hill Road a short distance from her parents home with keys in ignition, purse inside and a single boot print.","In May 1984, Carolyn Pruyser, an 18-year-old University of Alberta student, vanished from Peace River, Alberta.

On the evening of May 17, she watched a hockey game before driving with a friend to the Twelve Foot Davis Centre.

They briefly visited a submarine shop and a nearby convenience store to purchase a pack of DuMaurier Filter cigarettes.

Around 12:10 a.m. on May 18, Carolyn dropped her friend home — the last confirmed sighting of her alive.

About 10 minutes later, her blue 1978 Ford Fairmont was seen abandoned on Kaufman Hill Road.

When Carolyn did not return home, her father found the car with the driver’s window down, doors unlocked, and her purse inside.

Outside of a boot print on the driver’s side door, there was no indication of a struggle. 

RCMP believe she was abducted and murdered, though her remains have never been found.

--------

Weeks after Carolyn vanished, two men hunting in a remote area northeast of Manning, about 167 km from Peace River, discovered a fresh grave near a cabin along the east bank of the Peace River, south of the Notikewin Provincial Park boat launch.

The grave was six feet long with freshly disturbed dirt. The cabin’s owner was described as “sketchy,” and both he and the hunters’ brother-in-law lived in Peace River at the time.

The men reported the grave to RCMP multiple times over the years, but it is unclear whether it was ever thoroughly investigated.

-----

A man long considered a suspect in Carolyn’s disappearance recalls that on May 17, he was having coffee in the submarine shop when Carolyn and her friend entered.

They bought sandwiches, used the washroom, and then went next door to the convenience store.

He followed briefly to buy his own cigarettes, interacting minimally with Carolyn. He observed her leave in her car and noted an RCMP cruiser nearby that followed her south on Main Street.

Carolyn’s friend disputes his account, saying she never went into the submarine shop and did not see him speak with Carolyn.

The suspect emphasizes he was driving a brown 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass, not a black pickup truck reported by other witnesses. 

Over the years, he has conducted his own investigation, suggesting the RCMP officer who followed Carolyn that night may actually be responsible; this officer was stationed in Edson at the time and is now retired.

Retired Peace River RCMP sergeant Harry Danyluk confirmed that the man was a likely suspect early in the investigation due to prior violent behavior, including abuse of a girlfriend and damaging a police car during an arrest, but stated no RCMP officer was ever officially suspected.

The suspect responded that the severity of these incidents was exaggerated.  

Carolyn Pruyser’s disappearance remains an active case.

Lately I've been researching BPD to maybe get a grasp on why I fit the mold, and it does make some things make sense. For me, the hardest thing I seem to have is grasping the ""obsession"" side of things, especially when it comes to people.

My first relationship ended two years ago. She was toxic and manipulative and somehow I can't get over her, even now when she's moved on. I know that can happen but it seems a bit much for how she treated me versus how I treated her.

I have tried to put myself out there a little more, even lowkey falling in love with some guy I'd hardly met and asking him out after one conversation. He said no (thankfully) and I cried all night like a baby as if I'd known him for years and had been crushing on him a while.

There was a while where I was desperate need of someone to crush on and my old best friend from middle school became my victim of internet stalking.

Since then its been a stint of lonliness but now my brain and heart are at it again and I'm kinda falling for my best friend. We hardly text and never see eachother (though I'm trying to change that, we're currently making plans to go get coffee or something) but I've just got this abounding love in my heart for her and I can't get her out of my mind. Just the thought of being with her makes me smile, even though we only met earlier this year and I really don't know her all that well.

I'm scared now that this isn't healthy and is actually a problem on my end. Is it common with BPD to obsess like this? Do people normally crush this easily and dive headfirst into love like this?

So I gave them a $20… and then he hands me 7 of the modern $1 coins and says hey man, we made $8 on the deal, we insist!!!

1mz7xcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1mz7xcr/i_put_controversial_books_on_my_coffee_table_so/,I put controversial books on my coffee table so that I can keep the conversation going.,"My wife hates it but I'm not really great at small talk. 

I once had the idea when I was reading that one book by, Vladimir Nabokov (apparently, I can't say it here without getting flagged) and I had forgotten to put it up. Anyways my wife's friend saw it and was like isn't that the ""Weirdo"" book. 

I then explained to her that it isn't actually the point of the book and that Humbert is the villain it's just from his perspective. Either way this led down a whole rabbit hole of conversation and there wasn't a moment of awkwardness 

Well, the next time that my wife was going to have her friends over I told her that it would be funny if i put my edition of Mein Kampf on the coffee table. 

My wife really protested the idea and said that it would be a bad look, and we would look like Nazis. My take was that clearly, we aren't Nazis it's just a historically book, but it would definitely start an interesting conversation. She kind of just said fine and let it be. 

Well, my Wifes friend ""Lisa"" saw it instantly and just had a wrinkled expression on her face. She then asked why I have a copy. I said cause it's a historical book and its interesting. She then said, ""I don't think you should be interested in that type of stuff and its suspicious you have it"".

I then told her that lots of woman are into true crime so why can't i be interested in a person that changed the course of human history. She didn't really have a refute to my claim and was pretty salty after that. She kept her distance around from me the rest of the night. Afterwards I'm pretty sure she told her husband that he can longer hang out with me. 

I know I sort of come off as a pseudointellectual douchebag but really i just can't stand awkwardness I'd rather have a full blown argument then that. Still wondering what book i should put out next.

1mz7wsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1mz7wsq/am_i_asking_too_much_from_my_boyfriend/,Am I asking too much from my boyfriend,"I(43F) have been in a middistance relationship with my boyfriend(45M)for 2 years now. We see each other about 2 weekends per month so not that often. From the start of our relationship my boyfriend has had an issue of not looking at my naked body ie. in shower or other rare situations where I dont have clothes on out of bedroom. He has explained that it is because of his own insecurities and shyness. Obviously this has made feel sometimes unwanted and unattractive. 

This issue came up once again last weekend when I was spending a weekend at his place. In the morning I walked topless to kitchen to make coffee. He came too and instead of me getting his full attention or any looks/admiration he asked do I want a hoodie. I said no and something about giving him some eyecandy. He didnt reply really anything and didnt once raise his eyes up to look at me as we sat by the table to drink morning coffee. Just chatted this and that. I told him that it makes me feel so bad that he dont feel the need to look at my body. He said it is nothig to do with me he is just shy and uncomfortable to look. I cant tell u how unwanted this makes me feel as a woman and I spent half of the homejourney crying. 

Today I brought up the subject again over a phone call. I said I find it hard to believe that after 2 years he would feel shy about my body and that it would make feel happy if he would look at me. He said he already explained himself and dont feel like there is anything else to talk about and that he does look at me when Im not watching. Phone call went on me telling him that as my partner he should make an effort making me feel desired and he telling me he dont want to continue this phonecall and hanging up. 

Im feeling unseen and unwanted. Im thinking am I really asking too much. If the reason for his behaviour isnt lack of attraction but purely some issues he has within himself am I asking too much from him to give a look despite that shyness/issues. If he knows that giving me a glance that I notice and some nice words about my body would make me feel worthy and desired and smile for a long time instead of crying in the train is it really too much and selfish of me to ask it from him? I love making him feel wanted and dont forget to let him know how much I desire every inch of his body. I cant conprehend why he wouldnt want to do this simple small thing that is important to me.

***Wednesday***

“So, Pepper says you’re a native New Yorker…” Mrs Cromwell said, settling in for the mother of all inquisitions.

Lucas forced his lips into a semblance of a smile — though ‘*amicability’* was probably giving it too much credit. “Yes, ma’am. My parents are originally from South Carolina, but my brothers, my little sister and I were all born here. New Yorkers, through and through.”

He hoped the unasked-for detail might distract them long enough to leave his personal life alone. He forgot, for one blissful second, that these people had raised Senior Detective Pepper Cromwell.

“I take it that makes you the second youngest in the lineup?” Mr Cromwell asked knowingly.

Lucas glanced at Pepper, then realised what he’d said to give it away. ‘Little sister. ’ No *little brothers.* There was no walking it back either. Best to own it and keep going. “Yessir, I am. I have five older brothers, ranging from a politician down to a firefighter. Both my parents teach high school in Brooklyn.” His father would have loud words about being roped in with regular high school teachers, but it was easier to say that than mention he was the head coach.

“Your family believes in giving back to the community. That kind of dedication’s rare these days and very admirable.”

He hadn’t really thought about it like that. They were just jobs that needed doing. “Uhh—thank you?”

A hand suddenly fell on his right shoulder.

Fully expecting it to be Sararah’s hand, snaking unnaturally across the wall behind the sofa to get handsy, he whirled and snatched at the offending wrist, his fingers curling around the back of a male palm before his other hand lined up behind the elbow, ready to drive his attacker to their knees. Only then did he realise it was Mr Cromwell.

The flicker in Mr Cromwell’s expression showed he knew how close he’d come to being floored, and his other hand came up, his fingers spread in apology. “Easy there, son. I was just giving you a literal pat on the back, because you were looking a little spooked.”

Lucas swallowed and let him go.  “Sorry about that, sir. When people grab a cop by the shoulder like that, it’s rarely ever for a good reason.”

Mr Cromwell refocused on Lucas. “Still, you have the instincts of a fighter. More than most cops that I’ve ever run into.”

Pepper slid to her feet. “Dad, can you not? Please?”

Lucas patted the air between himself and his partner, letting her know it was okay. Her father had earned the answer after nearly being put on his knees in a full arm lock. Hell, looking at the way Mr Cromwell was still sitting on the other side of Pepper’s mom, he would’ve cleaned them both up with that move. “I compete in regional MMA when work allows. It helps keep me flexible.”

“That must certainly help in your line of work.”

“It doesn’t hurt.”

“And you’re recently engaged to an artist,” Mrs Cromwell asked, taking the subject away from combat; probably because she didn’t want to be reminded of how aggressive people could be when her daughter worked in law enforcement.

Just thinking about Boyd had a wistful smile forming on his lips, wishing he was straddling Boyd’s lap, stealing kisses instead of fielding questions. “Yes, ma’am,” he repeated, bobbing his head.

“Oh, Julie, please. You’re off the clock now.”

“Yes, ma—Julie.”

“Soooo, your fiancé—is she a painter?” she probed.

*“MOM!”* Pepper shouted, mortified.

“What? It’s an honest question, and everyone loves talking about the loves of their lives. It’s the perfectly reasonable thing to ask.”

“Unless you ask it entirely the wrong way,” Lucas smirked, a sense of mischievousness washing over him. *“He* is a fantastic sculptor.”

The horror on Julie’s face just before she covered her mouth shouldn’t have been as funny as it was.

“It’s fine, Julie, but before you make your next incorrect assumption based on my size, my fiancé is not a twink either.”

“That’s for sure,” Pepper agreed, snickering behind her hand.

“Unless the MCU’s Hulk passes for one, too,” Sararah laughed, clapping her hands together. “The guy’s a Godzilla-sized woodworker, and he works Lucas’ wood just fine. Isn’t that right, Detective Sexy Beast?”

Lucas closed his eyes, pressing his thumb against his cheekbone to rub the frown forming between his eyes with two fingers. He hadn’t thought it was possible, but with one sentence, Sararah had just proven she could out-sexualise Robbie at the most inappropriate time. Not that it should have surprised him. Robbie was the however-many-greats-grandson of a sex goddess, and Sararah was a succubus. Such was his life now.

“Hey!” Sararah suddenly yelped.

“This is why no one invites you to family dinners,” Pepper growled, her voice growing distant, and when Lucas opened his eyes just in time to catch his partner dragging Sararah from the room.

Silence hung heavy after the door banged shut.

“I heard she was a handful, but I never envisioned something like that,” Julie said, laughing and shaking her head in disbelief.

“Cut her some slack, ma’am. There are bad upbringings, and then there’s the one she went through.”

He felt the eyes turn on him — scrutiny, maybe surprise — but he didn’t regret shielding Sararah.

“What do you know about her upbringing?” Mr Cromwell asked.

“Apart from it being total hell?” *God, how did I say that with a straight face?* “From what I understand, there was no sense of family. No support. It was every person for themselves.”

“Surely someone looked after her as a child…” Julie insisted, and Lucas shook his head.

“No one clothed her or fed her. She ate what she could find when she found it and went hungry when she couldn’t. And as she got bigger, she was able to flaunt the one asset she had and became very good at it. The problem with being treated like a sexual object is that intimacy is the only ‘family’ she knows, and it’s transactional. From what I understand, Pepper is the first real friend she’s ever had outside the bedroom, so when faced with conversations and situations like this…” Lucas rolled his pointer finger to include the room. “She has no idea what she’s doing, so she falls back on what makes people laugh in the bedroom.”

Mr and Mrs Cromwell looked at each other, then both turned towards the hallway. “Pepper!” her father called.

“Yeah, Dad?”

“Could you bring Sarah back out here, please? Your mother and I would like to try this again.”

Pepper’s head popped around the corner of the hallway. “Are you sure? I mean, she doesn’t get any better…”

“How will she learn to be any different if she never experiences it firsthand, honey?” Julie asked, raising her hand to beckon them out. Sararah’s head peeked around the corner warily, and Julie smiled. “Come on out, sweetie,” she said, continuing her beckoning motion.

Sararah’s fearful gaze went to Lucas, who smirked and nodded encouragingly. “I-I can go out and leave you all to it,” she said, rubbing her hands down her pants leg as she stepped cautiously into the room.

“Oooorrrr…you can sit down and learn what it means to be part of a real family,” Mr Cromwell countered with a warm smile, pointing at the chair that the succubus had vacated. “Better late than never, darlin’.”

Pepper’s jaw was on the ground, even as Sararah slinked across the room and reclaimed her seat.

“Actually, you know what?” Mr Cromwell said, levering himself off the arm of the chair. When he took the far edge of the coffee table and started to lift it, Lucas shot to his feet.

“Here, let me,” Lucas said, knowing what the older man planned.

“Grab that end then, and we’ll lift it out of the way together.”

The moment the coffee table was relocated to the kitchen, Sararah and Pepper drew their chairs closer to the sofa.

“Much better. I do enough shouting over tables and waves at work,” Mr Cromwell said as he returned to his perch beside his wife, pleased.

“Are you sure you don’t want to sit here beside your wife?” Lucas asked, having yet to reclaim his seat. It felt all kinds of wrong to have the older man make do with the arm of the chair when he was perfectly capable of standing nearby.

“I’m su—” he grunted when Julie nudged him with her elbow. He looked at her, and Lucas caught the way Julie’s eyes flicked to Sararah. “Fine,” he groused as if it pained him to accept Lucas’ offer.

“Here, Lucas. You can have my seat,” Pepper said, sliding off her kitchen stool.

“Nah. Sexy Beast can have mine,” Sararah jumped in.

“Men don’t sit down when ladies are standing, Sarah,” Lucas said, shaking his head. “Even if I’m the guest. It’s a thing.”

“And which one of us is capable of standing up forever if I have to, huh? Stop being a pick and park your cute pass—awwww, shut up and sit down, you perk!” she snapped, when Lucas started laughing.

“What just happened?” Mr Cromwell asked, frowning.

“Sarah swore at the wrong person the other night, and now she’s hypnotised into not swearing for a whole month,” Lucas answered, knowing it wasn’t really his place to speak but figuring neither of the women would’ve thought of an adequate workaround on short notice. “My roommate calls it profanity prison, and he gets his sentence lifted either next Tuesday or next Wednesday, depending on how the ‘four weeks’ of the whammy is interpreted.”

“That doesn’t sound entirely legal…” Julie said, eyebrows lifting.

“It’s fine,” Sararah jumped in, ahead of everyone else. “I had plenty of warning, and I’d rather have the profanity ban over being cut off from them.” She looked down at her hands. “I only just found them.”

“It’s still not right,” Julie argued. “Swearing’s a damn right—”

“Picture swearing at the president of the United States at a press conference, Mom. Instead of going to jail for months or even years, these people have figured out a punishment that only stops someone from using foul language again for four weeks. In every other way, they are free to go about their lives.”

“I doubt you swore at the President,” Julie argued.

“No, I had to go and do it to someone way higher up the food chain than that,” Sararah groaned painfully.

“Who could possibly be higher than that?” Mr Cromwell asked. “The Pope?”

“You’re getting warmer,” Pepper muttered with a roll of her eyes, and Lucas had to focus on the paint blemishes on the wall to stop himself from laughing outright.

After I noticed she finished dinner with her friends, I bought a glass of wine and wrote my name and number down on a sheet of paper and went up to her while she was alone and said ""excuse me hey im ___, whats your name?"" She responded and I said ""great to meet you, i noticed you earlier at dinner, i was sitting across from you with my friends and noticed you and just had to come up and say hi and introduce myself. i wanted to buy you this, here's my number"" and she said ""oh thank you so much and she seemed to genuinely be caught off in a good way. 

Turns out we are both in the same industry,  and she liked what I do for work. She asked me questions about my job, I asked her where she lives, how long shes lived in town, how did she get into the fancy restaurant (you need an “in” to get in) and she asked me those questions back, etc. Seems like we had a lot in common and that she was putting real effort into the convo. I never mentioned her looks either. 

at the end I said ""well i'll let you go now but i'd love to take you out for coffee sometimes, you got my number, feel free to text me, see you around!"" and then she smiled and i think she said thank you or something idk lol. and then i left. and then about 2 hours later i ran into her on the way out  and i went up to her and said ""hey ___, so great to meet you again, have a good night!"" and she said ""oh ______ hey, great to meet you too, have a good night!"" and then we both went in for a hug. it seemmed like she was receptive but idk. my friends were super excited and even the bartender gave me a free drink after. 

This happened last night, so now I’m waiting for a response. It seems like she was putting in equal effort into the conversation as I did, asked me questions, etc, but hasn’t texted me back yet. I know it just happened last night literally 12 hours ago but still, I guess I’m overthinking. But at the same time I’m kinda proud of myself for doing that, and trying to take it as a win either way. But I also really want her to text me back haha.

It’s a simple AI-powered “second brain”: you type anything (a note, task, idea, or reminder), and it automatically classifies it, extracts due dates, and shows you a Today view with upcoming reminders.

Some things you can try:
-  “Remind me to call John tomorrow at 3pm”
-	“Meeting with Sarah Friday at 10am about invoices”
- “Idea: start a blog on coffee brewing tips”

It’s free to use, I would love a few testers to try it and tell me what feels useful or bad.

1mz7uzn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mz7uzn,Las Vegas 2025 Trip Report (6-Year-Old’s Birthday x Work Trip),"Hey everyone, just wanted to share an update on my recent 3 day Vegas trip over the weekend. I was there for work on Thursday but since my son’s 6th birthday was Saturday, I decided to roll both into one trip. A lot of people think Vegas isn’t for kids, but I completely disagree by the end, my 2-year-old was screaming and crying because he didn’t want to leave, yelling that he loves Las Vegas lol.

Hotel – Bellagio
We stayed at the Bellagio thanks to a comp from a high-roller friend. We had the Premier Queen room on the 4th floor.
Pros:
* Amazing location right in the middle of the Strip
* More upscale crowd and atmosphere
* Fountain show (still magical)
* Pools are kid-friendly
* Gelato shop = lifesaver for the kids
Cons:
* Food options are limited for low price and not convenient
* Pricey overall
* Rooms are starting to feel dated
Overall I’d give the Bellagio an 8.5/10. Still solid, but overdue for a refresh.

The Strip / Prices
This is the part I hate: everything is extremely expensive now. Even for someone who does well financially, it feels like there are fewer affordable options. $25 to park at Park MGM for 2 hours just to eat at a steakhouse? That’s lame. The Strip is thriving and alive though, with a good crowd and fewer scammers than in past years, which was nice to see.

Trip Highlights
* Work at Wynn: I got to shoot interviews in a $20K/night suite at the Wynn. That property is on another level easily years ahead of anywhere else on the Strip.
* Area15: If you’ve never been, Google it. It was the highlight of the trip for my kids— uper cool arcade/museum vibe. Cost me $140 for 4 tickets but worth every dollar. Highly recommend for families.
* Bavette’s Steakhouse (Park MGM): Took my son there for his birthday dinner. After researching on Reddit, I picked Bavette’s and wow probably one of the best meals of my life.
* Morning Gambling at Bellagio: I avoid nights (too much drunk energy) but mornings at 8am with coffee at the tables are unbeatable. Great crowd, great vibes. Walked away up $1K which covered most of the food and activities.

Final Thoughts
Vegas is still magical but feels like it’s on a slow decline because of rising costs. I really hope the affordability comes back, but it seems to only be trending upward.
That said, my kids loved the pools, the scale of the Strip, the food, the shows, all of it. My 6-year-old had an amazing birthday and my 2-year-old legit cried about leaving.
So yeah Vegas was a success. Thank you, Las Vegas, for another unforgettable trip.",1,1756070419.0,LasVegas,9,0.52,False
1mz7uw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1mz7uw1/i_do_not_know_if_my_problem_if_mental_or_physical/,I do not know if my problem if mental or physical (24f),"I sometimes wonder if I'm genuinely just making things up. I have no idea how to explain this so I'll just start with the facts:

I'm 24f, 5'1, and 120 lbs. I started going to multiple doctors a year ago because in June 2024 (so about 14 months ago now) my periods, which were always regular, just stopped coming. I had bloodwork, an ultrasound, and an MRI. My MRI was normal but the bloodwork showed very low estrogen and progesterone (everything else normal except cortisol and TSH were both on the higher end), and the ultrasound showed cysts.

  
The doctors diagnosed me with PCOS AND said I needed birth control, which raised my estrogen from 10 to 19 but lowered my progesterone and caused me to gain about 10lbs and made me severely depressed so I stopped it after two weeks. I had a withdrawal bleed but that was the only period I've had in the past year, and that was in April.

  
I have symptoms like severe fatigue (I need at least 2 coffees to get through the day and even then I go to sleep at 8), waking up to pee multiple times throughout the night to pee, waking up extremely early and not being able to sleep, extreme hunger and food noise, and anxiety and depression.

  
I also have to work out twice a day at this point and am always scared I'm going to gain weight again and feel like if I don't keep up with my exercise I will gain weight and it's like a constant loop. Especially because I know most people with PCOS do gain weight.

  
But my doctor says that there's nothing wrong with me and I mean he's right? I guess? Most of my bloodwork is normal and I'm doing what I can to manage. So am I just making things up? Am I wrong to still care about these other symptoms? I guess maybe I'm concerned about the thyroid because I want to just have a better metabolism so I don't have to worry about weight gain so much since it came on so easily before.

  
Is this all in my head? I've brought it up with my doctor but like I said he said I was fine and if I wanted I could just try birth control again. I don't think he'd offer me anything for my hunger or weight, which I get because I do understand that I'm at a healthy weight. But I am experiencing very real symptoms like rapid weight gain (when I'm not closely tracking calories and exercising constantly) and constant hunger and fatigue and I'm just wondering if this seems more mental or physical? I know I don't have an ED or anything because I genuinely eat 2500 calories a day on average even if I'd want to eat less (that's how bad the hunger is), and my doctor said HA/Reds was rules out.

Without hesitation, the boy turned to the man and said, “Sir, you can have my hot chocolate. I want you to smile today.” The man’s eyes welled up with tears as he quietly accepted the drink.

The barista smiled and said, “That’s the kindest thing I’ve heard all day.” The mom told her son, “You just made someone’s day, and mine too.”

1mz7ua0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperhidrosis/comments/1mz7ua0/strategies_to_avoid_handshake/,Strategies to avoid handshake,"*this is an answer that I found insightful from an LLM (Gemini):*


### 1. Strategies for Handling the ""In-Person Meeting"" Challenge

You can manage the situation without handshakes. People do this all the time for various reasons (religious, personal, hygiene).
* The Proactive Statement: As you approach, you can smile warmly, make eye contact, and say something like, ""I'm skipping handshakes at the moment, but it's a real pleasure to meet you in person."" Delivered confidently, this is accepted without question 99% of the time.
* The ""Hands Full"" Maneuver: Arrive holding a coffee/water bottle in one hand and your phone/notebook in the other. This makes a handshake physically awkward, and a simple nod and a warm ""So good to meet you"" will suffice.
* The Slight Bow/Nod: A slight, respectful bow of the head while making eye contact is a non-contact gesture of greeting used in many cultures and is perfectly acceptable.
* Suggest a Different Meeting Format: Propose a ""walking meeting"" or a coffee at a small table. These settings make a formal handshake less of an automatic ritual.




Here is a breakdown of the specific reasons people might have for not shaking hands, categorized for clarity.

### 1. Religious Reasons

This is often related to principles of modesty and physical contact between genders.

*   **Islam:** Many observant Muslim men and women refrain from physical contact with members of the opposite sex who are not their immediate family (known as *non-mahram*). This is a sign of respect and modesty.
    *   **Common Practice:** Instead of a handshake, a person may place their right hand over their heart and give a slight nod and a smile. This is a warm and respectful alternative.
*   **Orthodox Judaism:** A similar principle, known as *shomer negiah* (""observant of touch""), is practiced by many Orthodox Jews. It also involves refraining from physical touch with members of the opposite sex outside of their immediate family.
*   **Hinduism and Buddhism:** While not a strict prohibition, the traditional greeting in many Hindu and Buddhist cultures is the *Namaste* or *Anjali Mudra* (placing the palms together at the chest and bowing slightly). This is an inherently non-contact, respectful gesture that predates the handshake in these cultures.

### 2. Hygiene and Health Reasons

This has become far more common and understood, especially since 2020.

*   **General Germ Transmission:** Handshakes are a well-known vector for transmitting viruses and bacteria, from the common cold and flu to stomach bugs and COVID-19. Many people simply prefer to minimize this risk.
*   **Immunocompromised Individuals:** People with weakened immune systems (due to chemotherapy, autoimmune diseases, or other conditions) must be extremely careful about exposure to germs. For them, avoiding handshakes is a critical health precaution.
*   **Mysophobia (Germaphobia):** This is a specific anxiety disorder involving a pathological fear of germs and contamination. For someone with this condition, a handshake can cause significant distress.
*   **Healthcare Professionals:** Doctors and nurses are trained in infection control and often avoid handshakes in clinical settings to prevent carrying germs from one patient to another.

### 3. Personal and Cultural Reasons

This category covers a wide range of individual preferences and social norms.

*   **Personal Space and Boundaries:** Some people are simply not comfortable with physical touch from strangers or acquaintances. It has nothing to do with the other person, but is simply a personal boundary and a preference for maintaining their own space.
*   **Physical Conditions:** This is a very common but often invisible reason.
    *   **Hyperhidrosis (like your situation):** Self-consciousness about sweaty palms is a primary reason people avoid handshakes.
    *   **Arthritis or Injury:** Shaking hands can be painful for someone with arthritis in their hands, a recent injury, or a repetitive strain condition.
    *   **Skin Conditions:** People with eczema, psoriasis, or warts on their hands may be self-conscious or concerned about irritating their skin.
*   **Cultural Norms:** The handshake is a predominantly Western custom. In many cultures, particularly in East Asia (e.g., Japan, Korea), a bow is the traditional and most respectful form of greeting. A Westerner insisting on a handshake can be seen as culturally unaware.
*   **Social Anxiety:** The ritual of a handshake—making eye contact, judging the right amount of pressure, the duration—can be a source of significant anxiety for some people, who prefer to avoid the situation altogether.
*   **Neurodivergence (e.g., Autism Spectrum):** Many people on the autism spectrum experience sensory sensitivity. The physical sensation of another person's hand (its temperature, texture, moisture, pressure) can be jarring, unpleasant, or overwhelming.

In short, you are in very good company. The simple, confident statement, **""I'm skipping handshakes, but it's wonderful to meet you,""** is an elegant and modern way to handle the situation that covers all of these valid reasons.



*and if they ask why? what should I say?*



That is the single most important question to be prepared for, as it's the source of the anxiety.

First, let's establish a critical fact: **It is very rare and generally considered rude for someone to ask ""Why?"" in this situation.** A polite person will simply accept your statement and move on. If they do ask, they are making a social misstep, not you.

Your goal is not to justify yourself, but to **politely and firmly end the inquiry** while maintaining your professional composure. You have a playbook with three tiers of response, from gentle to firm. You can choose the one that feels most comfortable.

### The Playbook: How to Respond to ""Why?""

---

### **Tier 1: The Gentle Brush-Off (Use this 99% of the time)**

This is the best first response. It's vague, friendly, and signals that the topic is not up for discussion. The key is to **say it with a warm, confident smile and immediately pivot the conversation.**

**Choose one of these simple phrases:**

*   **""Oh, just a personal preference.""** (This is the best one. It's polite, final, and universally understood.)
*   **""It's just a habit I've gotten into.""** (Relatable and requires no further explanation, especially post-pandemic.)
*   **""Just being a bit more cautious these days.""** (Also completely understandable and requires no follow-up.)

**Crucial Step:** After you say your line, **do not wait for their reaction.** Immediately pivot to the reason you are there.

*   **Example:**
    *   **Them:** ""No handshake? Why?""
    *   **You:** (Smiling) *""Oh, just a personal preference. Anyway, it's a real pleasure to meet you in person. I was really looking forward to discussing the new strategy.""*
    *   **You:** (Smiling) *""It's just a habit I've gotten into. So, shall we grab a seat?""*

This smooth pivot immediately re-directs the conversation back to business and signals that the handshake topic is closed. This will work in almost every scenario.

---

### **Tier 2: The Polite Pivot (If they are oddly persistent)**

If, for some reason, they ask a second time (e.g., ""But what's the preference?""), you don't need to give more detail. You just need to be slightly more direct in your pivot.

**The formula is: [Acknowledge] + [State Boundary] + [Forceful Pivot].**

*   **Example:**
    *   **Them:** ""No, really, I'm just curious why.""
    *   **You:** (Still pleasant but more direct) *""I appreciate your curiosity, but I'd rather not get into it. Now, the main thing I wanted to talk about today was [Topic A]...""*
    *   **You:** *""It's really not important. What *is* important is the feedback you had on our proposal. Shall we start there?""*

This communicates, ""I'm not going to discuss this, and we are moving on now.""

---

### **Tier 3: The Firm, Final Boundary (The ""Nuclear Option"")**

This is for the exceptionally rare case where someone is being deliberately pushy or rude. At this point, you have every right to be completely firm. Your tone should remain calm and professional, but the message is unmistakable.

**The goal here is to end the conversation about this topic definitively.**

*   **Example:**
    *   **Them:** (Still pushing the issue)
    *   **You:** (Look them in the eye, smile fades slightly) *""As I said, I prefer to keep my reasons private. Let's please focus on the agenda for our meeting.""*
    *   **You:** *""I'm not going to discuss my personal choices. We have 30 minutes to talk about [the project], and I'd like to make sure we use that time effectively.""*

This is a professional's way of saying ""Drop it."" It would be almost impossible for them to continue without appearing completely unprofessional.

### **Key Takeaway & Your Mindset**

*   **Prepare for Tier 1.** Memorize one of the simple lines like, **""Just a personal preference.""** Practice saying it with a smile. This is all you will likely ever need.
*   **You are in control.** By not offering a handshake, you have already set the terms of the greeting. If they question it, they are the ones making things awkward. Your calm, confident response simply maintains the professional frame you've already established.
*   **You owe no one an explanation.** Your reasons are your own. The goal is not to win an argument, but to smoothly move into the substance of your meeting.

I would love to put morals to one side and focus purely on advancement. Advancement of what, is variable, for me it would be aerospace entrepreneurship, maybe for a government it would be crueler but cheaper prisons. It would be cheaper and it seems like it would be more efficient, but the fact of the matter is that humans are moral beings. 
If we have an innate sense of right and wrong that’s accurate is a question I’ll leave to the philosophers. Focusing on advancement, it doesn’t matter if our sense of right and wrong holds some universal truth, because the majority of society will act as though it does. 
I cannot discard morality in favour of efficiency when organising other people, as it seems like being immoral, feeding that inner beast, actually hurts your sense of the world and self. Hills seem to get steeper, days seem to get longer. 
Coffee seems to get weaker. 
Theres a core principle of Buddhism which is, in a nutshell, to be detached from external happiness, and that true happiness comes from within. I think it’s similar to that. 
Let’s say I stole $100 worth of items from a big, corporate shop.

She responded and I said ""great to meet you, i noticed you earlier at dinner, i was sitting across from you with my friends and noticed you and just had to come up and say hi and introduce myself. i wanted to buy you this, here's my number"" and she said ""oh thank you so much and she seemed to genuinely be caught off in a good way.

I never mentioned her looks either. 

at the end I said ""well i'll let you go now but i'd love to take you out for coffee sometimes, you got my number, feel free to text me, see you around!"" and then she smiled and i think she said thank you or something idk lol. and then i left. and then about 2 hours later i ran into her on the way out  and i went up to her and said ""hey ___, so great to meet you again, have a good night!"" and she said ""oh ______ hey, great to meet you too, have a good night!"" and then we both went in for a hug. it seemmed like she was receptive but idk. my friends were super excited and even the bartender gave me a free drink after.

The cost of living here for me would be $1,200 in Seattle it was around $5k.. I lived outside of Seattle but worked in Seattle. 

The problem is I cannot find a job here. I have a lot of experience in bartending, nightlife, restaurants, corporate, marketing, tech, account management, and even coffee. I’ve been applying non-stop to both entry-level and more advanced jobs I’m qualified (or overqualified) for, but I keep running into ghost postings, ridiculous “entry-level” requirements, or just silence.

The nightlife/restaurant/bar scene here also feels impossible to break into. I’ve worked in Miami, and it’s more “alive” so to speak, I never had an issue there, LA has this really condescending vibe. The two interviews I managed to snag, they actually didn’t ask me questions or interview me.. The experiences were bizarre. One place said they wanted “real serving experience” I’m 28, since I was 16 years old I’ve served in restaurants. I’ve bartended for 5 years. 

I know the job market is terrible right now, but I’m really struggling. I’m behind on my car payment, my savings are almost gone, and my partner is barely covering bills himself. My mental health is slipping to a scary spot and I’m getting desperate.

If anyone has advice, leads, or even survival job recommendations in LA, I’d really appreciate it. Anything helps.

We know, intellectually, that it’s nonsense, right? But breaking the cycle of self abandonment is incredibly hard. It surfaces every time we try to escape uncomfortable emotions, troublesome realities, or simple exhaustion.
What if we committed to practicing self love, portion by portion, each day? For example, by sitting in a comfy armchair, curled up in soft blankets, inhaling the aroma of freshly baked bread and brewed coffee, or fragrant tea, in a nourishing self hug for five minutes, twice a day. Sometimes, it helps to lower our expectations or loosen our commitments and instead focus on rebuilding our relationships with ourselves gradually, step by step, with absolute kindness.

However since the drone was now in a position of higher authority they would begin to abuse it, he saw his old WD group turned skitarii as lesser than him, he also despised the DDs turned skitarii and would regularly harm them as a form of ""revenge"" despite a few no longer wanting to harm others, they were also incredibly arrogant never taking a suggestion that wasn't his, C now known as Siivox would try to reason with the WD but would ignore her or insult her.

The final straw was went siivox was in another scouting run with the warband and the WD marine commented ""you oilsucker would be worthless without my group's intervention, so you should be grateful that i even have you alive and not turned into mindless servitor loading arms...""

Siivox responded with:

""look i'm thankful that i could live again, but being that you were once a worker drone wouldn't you be more helping for your kind and not be as hateful to them?, you mentioned your hatred on the oppressive humans but you are treating them the exact same, if i were to be in the same situation i would have guided them to become free like me but you chose to enslave them, i could help you in restoring their libert-""

The WD marine would pick up Siivox and rip her in half leaving her to die.

Later on, Marelex Sorion, a techseer, and a low rank magos took her in and started to work on her trying to repair her, they saw that she was a former DD and were going to dispose of her before coming to the conclusion that she would be better off as a tech priest due to her connection to machinery.

  
Siivox's origins before becoming a DD:

she used to work at an office filing paperwork and sorting documents, bonding with humans a bit though would suffer a coffee spill which would led her to be dumped, absolute solver would find her and make her into a DD along with D and K.

After becoming a DD: 

C was like the rest though bits of her WD personality peeked through they left for copper 9 and met F whose pod crash landed killing their other squadmates, they wandered copper 9 finding a few small outposts before finding the factory where the industrialists resided in.

The Industrialists are a specialized group of Worker Drones created by JCJenson made to be more resilient and being smarter in the way of making and forging equipment in the industrial factory, they were programmed to help others of their group and prevent workplace accidents due to them being of somewhat limited run.

The DD squad attacked killing many in the process, but the industrialists fought back using pipes, wretches, power tools, among many others, C was hesitant on killing but managed to kill 2 IDs before getting ambushed by a few one with a powersaw cut her in half and another took a hammer drill and drilled in her core damaging her heavily, D killed a few more and was challenged by an industrialist with a pipe she stabbed him with her claws and flew over to an open pool of molten metal, she dropped him in but at the last second he grabbed onto her dragging her down in the pool of metal, D desperately tried to get out but the drone was dragging her down he knew he was dead but was going to drag D with him.

F saw this and tried pulling out D but the only thing left intact was her arm, they flew out of there seeing how they're probably gonna sustain another loss, F grabbed C's body before flying out of there trying to see if she could be saved.

K was slaughtering a lot and eating them including Evelyn a female Industrial drone who was the wife of Raul the leader of the industrialists, K was taking pleasure in eating her before Raul sneaked up and stabbed him multiple times with a screwdriver, while he was in pain Raul stabbed him more even in K's eye, he would pick up the body of his dead wife and hide inside a storage unit where the remaining drones were in there, among them was Mallie Raul's daughter, she witnessed the death of her mom and was heartbroken at that point.

K and F left the factory and were discussing on what to do K said that they should take C's body and put it in the scrapyard since she was no longer useful to the group, F wanted to argue against it but accepted since K wanted to lead things his way, they flew to the scrapyard and threw C's body in, F stood there seeing how many drones were dead and feeling that they would soon join them, K wanted to get vengeance so he started to hide out in a nearby city waiting for the IDs to come out so he could eat them.

In the meantime, Raul made new orders on expanding the underground storage facility in order for the ""sky demons"" to not enter easily such as, fake entrances, a complex tunnel system, 2 fake floors, traps, and learning ways to make better weapons to defend themselves.

1mz7m3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mz7m3q/unable_to_make_a_good_long_black_synchronika_2/,Unable to make a good long black [Synchronika 2],"At the beginning of the month we purchased a Synchronika 2 as an engagement gift from my mom, upgrading from our Breville Infuser. I’ve been absolutely loving the machine: dialling in some very tasty shots that are far better than the best I’ve managed with the Breville, and so much easier to get consistent results shot to shot. So far I can’t get milk textured as nicely as I could with the Breville but that’s just a matter of needing practice with the much higher steam power.

But… I have been unable to make a good long black, which is one of my go-to drinks. The problem is that I can’t get a nice float of crema on top like I could with the Breville. The way I’d make a long black with that machine was to draw water from the hot water spout into the mug, then pull the shot directly on top. The espresso would mix perfectly with the water and the crema would float on top, leaving a nice creamy layer that looked exactly the like the crema on a shot of espresso. With the Synchronika, no matter what I’ve tried, the crema left floating on top is pale yellow, almost white, with clumps of oily brown that float around. It looks very ugly.

I quickly learned that drawing water straight from the spout of the Synchronika was no good as it was way too hot, due to coming from the steam boiler. So, I’ve tried drawing some water into a milk pitcher and letting that cool while I prep the shot, before pouring it into the cup. The coffee isn’t too hot to drink doing that routine, but I still get nasty looking crema.

So, I tried heating some water separately in my kettle, set to 70c. (A bit of a pain, to be honest.) Nope, still not getting a nice float on the drink.

I thought, maybe it’s the bottomless portafilter? The espresso is falling from too high a height and hitting the water with too much force? I switched to the spouted portafilter so that the espresso would land much more gently. Nope, didn’t fix anything.

What is going on? Why can’t I make a simple long black?

(To be clear, the problem is not the shot itself. My straight shots have been consistently awesome.)",1,1756069836.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1mz7m16,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1mz7m16/i_can_feel_our_friendship_slowly_coming_to_an_end/,I can feel our friendship slowly coming to an end…,"I have been friends with this person since we were both 13, now we’re both in our late 20s. We were best friends all throughout school and into our late teens but we ended up going to different universities. We always made a huge effort to keep in touch and meet regularly whether it was for a coffee, a night out, a sleepover or even an annual holiday abroad.

Over 2 years ago I moved to the other side of the world and still kept in touch with this friend daily. During this time she bought a home with her partner and I was travelling having new experiences and making new friends. When I returned home a few months ago, it felt that something had changed in our friendship that I just couldn’t quite put my finger on. Messages to her would go unanswered or delivered for days, and any hangouts we’d have would be initiated by me, she never asked me about my travels or experiences, and after we would hang out together she would not text or respond to me for a few days, which would make me feel that she felt hanging out with me was a chore, she’d take a break from me after hanging out essentially.

There have been some more examples of her being a bit distant with me such as wishing me a happy birthday in the few last hour of my birthday after not contacting me all day (some may find this petty but I would have always made a big deal of her birthday - when I was living abroad I always made sure to send her home a gift and I didn’t receive a gift from her while I was away) and recently we had scheduled a hangout for a few days prior and the morning of the hangout I double checked with her that she was still up for it and she texted me back saying “it completely slipped her mind” explaining that she was now busy and made up all these excuses and could we meet the next day instead which I was fine with, I guess I was a little hurt that she forgot seeing as I’m her best friend.

I’m just feeling sad as I think this could be the start of us moving on with our adult lives as it just seems to me we don’t have as much in common anymore, especially when I compare this friendship with the friendships I have made in my 20s, it just really feels like she isn’t putting into the friendship what I’m willing to put in - any advice or people who might have gone through a similar situation?

AITA for not giving him a chance after being stood up?,"Hello, I'm 26F and today I was stood up on a date by a guy who asked me out. Literally, he asked, picked the place, and the time...and yet, I was still stood up. I'll give a bit of background here for context and for the sake of the story we will call the guy, Timmy. 

I actually met Timmy on Friday last week, when I was coming from work on the train. I was with my friend after we came from a bookstore stop called, ""The Strand,"" because I couldn't ignore the urge to get a new book because that's what bookworms like myself do, with our overgrowing TBR--Anyway, back to the point..Timmy and I exchange instagrams that Friday because I was delighted to meet a guy that seemed to like books as much as I did. I was intrigued and our conversation on the train for just those floating minutes left an impression on me. Not good enough to be called a first impression but good enough to have a chat later which we ultimately did. 

Following the Saturday, we began to proceed to chat and I liked talking with him. Timmy seemed nice and I was willing to get to know him better. As we were chatting over instagram, he was saying he wanted to see me again and asked me out for coffee, which we all know is date, and although I didn't like coffee, I said yes because I knew it wouldn't have been my only options at the cafe and we proceeded to talk through the rest of the day. 

As the day was basically coming to an end and we were still messaging on instagram, while I was over the phone with my best friend while I was going through my closet for an outfit. But honestly, I was feeling a bit wary considering the last guy that tried to get to know me turned into my stalker and basically harassed me for a year and change...so I was feeling a bit nervous and was expressing that to my best friend, which he understood but he encouraged me to go and give it shot. I had picked out my outfit and was basically planning to get a goodnight's sleep for my date. However, Timmy was still texting and this was already past 12am, which kinda bothered me alongside something else he said in the message, which I know he meant has a joke but it gave me the yuck. He asked me if I was a writer as much as a reader and I told him yes. He replied, ""A negro that can also read and write. Our ancestors are celebrating."" which basically didn't sit right with me. I replied with, ""I don't know what to say to that because I've never once thought my accentors to be uneducated."" I found it odd, that a man, who was also a person of color who was taking me on date, was basically talking to me like that...it kind of puzzled me and the little impression of him that I had, which started to shift a bit because it was so distasteful...but the date was going to happen.

Today, a Sunday. We are meeting at a cafe he picked, alongside with the time he told me which was 11am EST. I got up at 7:30am and started getting ready, doing all the girly things one would do the day of. And left my home at 9:50am and texted him letting him know I did and didn't hear back. I got to the agreed spot at 10:23am, texting him that I had arrived and didn't hear back. He didn't even read my message before which I found odd but since our agreed time didn't pass, I went into a cafe named, ""Joy,"" and took a seat after asking for a glass of water. I waited for about a few moments before checking my phone again, it was already 10:42am and he still wasn't here nor read my messages. And at this point, my expectations got lower and I already could feel disappointment settling in like a bad curse. When our agreed time came around, he was late and wasn't here. I mentally noted that the first REAL impression was a fail and I was only giving 10 mins as a grace period. When the grace period had finally passed, I was set on leaving and that's when I finally heard back from him with his reply reading, ""I'm sorry, I came in late last night and overslept.""

...Timmy had overslept...I understand that things happen but something as basic as setting an alarm to wake up for a date he asked me on...well, had set any interest I had for him out the window because he hadn't done that. Which made the time I had spent, standing in front of a mirror wondering how to do my hair, if I should do light make-up, and if the purse I felt didn't go with the look and swapped it out 3 times!!!... Just made me feel, forgotten and that my time had been wasted. I replied with, ""It's fine, maybe another time."" which he replied with, ""Damn, I understand that."" That's when I realized, I really wasted my time. I left the cafe and proceeded to unfollow him and also have him unfollow me as well restricted him. Because I felt my effort on a date HE asked me on, picked the place for and the time, was met with half-assed-ness and the mannerism of child picking up a flower in his backyard and giving it to the girl across the street just to forget about her moments later...The amount of debating, positive affirmation from my friends, and the level of comfort I had to force into myself, after what I'd been through, was all a waste. It was almost like a slap to the face because it was the first date I'd been on since the stalker problem. And imagine, if my expectations of men was already low because of what I'd been through. Imagine what I'm thinking now combined with it?

I was met with low effort. Very low effort. Talked a big game of wanting to see me again, made this plan to meet only to but slept through it? The intention, action, and words weren't matching. 

As of right now, I'm home and he has texted me on instagram again but I haven't opened it to see what it said. I've lost any trust and respect in the words that he could say right now because I find it absolutely crazy, that I was doing everything that he was suppose to be doing as the person who asked me out. It almost felt like I WAS THE ONE THAT ASKED HIM OUT. Personally, I don't feel there will be a next time. And after what I've been through, I've learned to listen to first impressions matters and I shouldn't ignore them. And what I learned from his first impression; he doesn't follow through on plans or most likely forget about them. He's a low effort and probably is a bit irresponsible. And I'm pretty sure, every book he's picked up to read...he has never finished...

I'm not even saying all that to be mean nor rude...but if you do not respect people's time that you asked for, that's the first impression of disrespect in my eyes. Especially, as a man who took the lead to organize the date and not being the one to show up. It may have not been intentional disrespect but it was still disrespect. And there is a level of trust, respect, and chance he lost there. 

I mean, am I wrong? AITA for not giving him a chance after he stood me up today? Am I being strict about what happened? ",2,1756069757.0,dating,3,1.0,False

1mz7jnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovoNordisk_Stock/comments/1mz7jnj/eli_lilly_vs_novo_according_to_cnbc_journalist/,Eli Lilly vs Novo according to CNBC journalist,"This demonstrates how much copium there is with Eli Lilly stock.  It is well written **but** this article, as well as all analysts, fail to mention that Eli Lilly has no real follow-up oral drug while Novo Nordisk will launch oral amycretin well before 2030.  So, those analyst estimates are garbage. (Eli Lilly's drug pipeline primarily consists of injectables, with Naperiglipron being the the only oral solution but it is highly volatile, if you've gone through their results.)

Also, Cagrilintide with a \~1% drop out (!) rate is going to be the maintenance solution for those who want to sustain their weight loss, not an oral drug with like \~25% drop out (!!) rates.

\_\_\_\_\_

[Eli Lilly](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LLY/)’s stock is still recovering after the drugmaker [released trial data ](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/eli-lilly-obesity-pill-weight-los-trial.html)earlier this month on its closely watched [obesity pill](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/24/eli-lilly-to-release-weight-loss-pill-orforglipron-trial-data-.html) that underwhelmed Wall Street.

In a key late-stage trial, Eli Lilly’s pill, orforglipron, caused less weight loss and had higher side effects than what analysts were expecting. The pill’s efficacy also appeared to come in slightly below that of [Novo Nordisk](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVO/)’s oral semaglutide for obesity, which showed strong data in a separate study.

Shares of Eli Lilly fell about 13% on the day the trial results were released, although they’re up about 12% since then.

But some analysts say Eli Lilly’s daily pill, if approved, could still be a viable competitor in the weight loss drug space — even if it will likely be second to enter the market. It’s a highly lucrative area that is eager for more convenient options that could ease the supply shortfalls and access hurdles created by the pricey weekly injections currently dominating it.

Analysts note that Eli Lilly’s pill could have a few advantages over the daily oral version of Novo Nordisk’s weight loss drug semaglutide, which is on track to become the[ first needle-free alternative](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-accepts-filing-application-for-oral-semaglutide-25-mg-which-if-approved-would-be-the-first-oral-glp-1-treatment-for-obesity-302445232.html) for obesity to win approval in the U.S. later this year. Eli Lilly hopes to[ launch its pill ](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/08/07/eli-lilly-ceo-david-ricks-on-q2-earnings-obesity-pill-late-stage-trial-results.html)globally “this time next year,” CEO David Ricks told CNBC in early August.

Both drugs work by mimicking a gut hormone called GLP-1 to suppress appetite and regulate blood sugar. But while Novo Nordisk’s pill is a peptide medication, orforglipron is a small-molecule drug.

That means Eli Lilly’s pill is absorbed more easily in the body and doesn’t require dietary restrictions like Novo Nordisk’s does. Orforglipron will also be easier to manufacture at scale, which is crucial as demand for obesity and diabetes injections outpaces supply.

Neither company has released prices for its respective pill, but some analysts said Eli Lilly’s drug could potentially have a lower price than Novo Nordisk’s pill. That would be a notable edge, as many health plans in the U.S. still don’t cover obesity treatments.

“It’s a little bit of an apples and oranges comparison because Novo Nordisk could have difficulty manufacturing enough of the product, given the high cost and requirements to manufacture oral semaglutide,” Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in an interview. 

“Whereas Lilly plans to blanket the world with orforglipron, and very quickly it will generate dramatically more sales,” he continued. “It can launch globally in an extraordinary manner with lower prices and with no food intake consideration.”

Goldman Sachs analysts seem to agree, based on a note in August. They forecast daily oral pills will capture 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market, which they expect to be worth $95 billion. 

The Goldman analysts said they expect Eli Lilly’s pill to have a 60% share — or roughly $13.6 billion — of the daily oral segment of the market in 2030. They expect Novo Nordisk’s oral semaglutide to have a 21% share — or around $4 billion — of that segment. The remaining 19% slice will go to other emerging pills, the analysts said.

The race to develop a more convenient obesity pill has been fraught, as companies such as [Pfizer](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PFE/) have had to [scrap](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/14/pfizer-scraps-daily-weight-loss-pill-danuglipron.html) previous contenders and bring forward new ones. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also exploring other experimental oral drugs, along with a slate of other companies such as [Viking Therapeutics](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/VKTX/), [Structure Therapeutics](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/undefined/), [AstraZeneca](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AZN/) and [Roche](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ROG-CH/). 

In a statement, Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustar said “we strongly believe in the efficacy” of the oral drug. The Danish company added it will be “laser-focused on getting this product to patients without supply constraints” in the U.S. 

Dr. Mihail “Misha” Zilbermint, director of endocrine hospitalists at Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, said it’s hard to crown a winner between Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk without knowing how their respective pills will be priced and whether insurance will cover them. 

“I think both of the drugs are going to be gamechangers,” he said. “When it comes to which company is going to win the game — cost is the biggest issue.”

# Weight loss, side effect comparisons

It’s difficult to directly compare the results of separate clinical trials, especially as investors wait for Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to release the full data from their phase three studies.

Eli Lilly’s ATTAIN-1 trial also followed 3,000 patients, while Novo Nordisk’s OASIS 4 study evaluated a[ much smaller group ](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05564117)of roughly 300. There are currently no studies directly comparing the two drugs, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said.

But Novo Nordisk’s oral semaglutide appears to cause a greater level of weight loss than Eli Lilly’s pill based on the available data, said BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman. 

In the trial, the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s pill helped patients lose 12.4% of their body weight on average at 72 weeks. The pill’s weight loss was 11.2% when analyzing all patients regardless of discontinuations.

Wall Street had hoped Eli Lilly’s pill would generate weight loss of around 15%, the same level as Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight loss injection Wegovy. Semaglutide is the active ingredient in Wegovy and its diabetes counterpart Ozempic.

Meanwhile, the 25-milligram dose of Novo Nordisk’s oral semaglutide helped patients lose up to 16.6% of their weight on average at 64 weeks, according to results from the trial presented at a medical conference in 2024. That weight loss was 13.6% when the company analyzed all patients regardless of whether they stopped the drug. 

A Novo Nordisk spokesperson added that 20% of weight loss was observed in nearly one-third of patients in the trial.

Still, the slightly lower efficacy of Eli Lilly’s pill may not be significant enough to deter patients from taking it. 

“For many patients, 12% is a really great number,” said Seigerman. “There’s definitely a market there” for orforglipron.

In a note earlier this month, Bank of America analysts shared a similar sentiment. 

“Yes, weight loss fell a bit short, but ask 100 prescribers whether this new data will really make a difference in who they’d put on orforglipron, and our belief is the vast majority would say, ‘not really,’” they wrote, referring to Eli Lilly’s trial data. 

Some investors raised concerns about the side effects and discontinuation rates in the trial of Eli Lilly’s pill. But Seigerman said the drug’s tolerability data — how well patients tolerate it — appears to be relatively in line with that of Novo Nordisk’s oral semaglutide. 

About 10.3% of patients who took the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s pill — 36 milligrams — discontinued treatment due to side effects, compared with around 2.6% of those who took a placebo.

Those side effects were mainly gastrointestinal, such as nausea and vomiting, and mild to moderate in severity. An estimated 24% of those who took the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s pill reported vomiting, while 33.7% had nausea. 

Leerink’s Risinger said he is watching to see how persistent those gastrointestinal issues are once Eli Lilly presents the full data. 

The side effects in the trial on Novo Nordisk’s pill were mostly gastrointestinal-related: 30.9% of those who took oral semaglutide reported vomiting and 46.6% reported nausea, according to the trial results. 

Johns Hopkins’ Zilbermint said it’s difficult for him to decide which one has a better safety and tolerability profile based on the available data. 

Meanwhile, Seigerman pointed to a different factor “that will also matter a lot”: dietary requirements. 

# Food requirements, manufacturing, price 

Unlike Eli Lilly’s pill, patients need to take Novo Nordisk’s oral semaglutide in the morning on an empty stomach with no more than four ounces of plain water. They’re instructed to wait 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other oral medicines.

Seigerman said that could be a hurdle for some patients. 

For example, “if you’re a parent with kids and you have to take this drug and wait half an hour before you can drink your coffee, you’re going to drive yourself crazy, especially if you have to take this every day,” he said. “I try to think about the real-world use of these drugs in a market like this. It’s going to matter.” 

Leerink’s Risinger said oral semaglutide will also be “extremely expensive to manufacture” since it is a peptide medication, and “is likely going to have to be priced higher than orforlipgron.”

A Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the pill will be made mostly in the U.S., and the company is excited about the potential the pill “provides millions of Americans living with obesity.”

“Currently, all typical launch readiness activities \[for the pill\] are fully underway and building momentum,” the spokesperson said. They added that over the past decade, the company has invested $24 billion in the U.S. to expand manufacturing capacity and fuel research and development. That includes investments aimed at increasing manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients and capacity for the final stages of production for both current and future injectable and oral products. 

Small molecules are chemically simpler and easier to produce at scale, making them generally cheaper for companies to formulate. But it is still unclear how Eli Lilly will price orforglipron. 

During an earnings call in August, Eli Lilly’s Ricks said the pricing will be based on the value orforglipron brings, considering health-care savings and the comorbidities it can address.

In the note earlier this month, Goldman Sachs analysts said they expect the pill to be “priced at parity” to Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide, the active ingredient in the company’s obesity injection Zepbound and diabetes counterpart Mounjaro, which list for just over $1,000 for a month’s supply. 

“They should be cheaper than injections because they are easier to produce. But it does not mean they will be cheaper,” Johns Hopkins’ Zilbermint said. “We just don’t know — for example, we don’t know how much went into research and development.”

Seigerman said commercialization strategies will also be key when the pills compete on the market. 

He questioned whether Novo Nordisk will lean into the deal it recently struck with [CVS](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CVS/)’s pharmacy benefit manager, [Caremark](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/01/cvs-wegovy-caremark-patients.html). Under the deal, Caremark started to prioritize Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy on its standard formularies on July 1, making that weekly injection the preferred GLP-1 drug for obesity over Zepbound. 

But it is unclear whether oral semaglutide could receive a similar preferential status.

Seigerman also questioned whether Eli Lilly will offer orforglipron through its direct-to-consumer pharmacy, [LillyDirect](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/25/eli-lilly-offering-more-cheaper-vials-of-zepbound-weight-loss-drug.html). That offering bypasses insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, allowing patients to directly purchase Zepbound and some of Eli Lilly’s other drugs from the company. 

Seigerman said he expects “a lot of nuances in the go-to-market campaign for these drugs,” adding “that’s going to matter.”

# Other competitors trail behind

Other obesity pills are in earlier stages of development, making it difficult to directly compare them to the drugs from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk without longer and larger trials. 

But so far, some experts think they pale in comparison.

For example, Viking Therapeutics on Tuesday [released mid-stage trial data that disappointed](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/19/viking-therapeutics-obesity-pill-data.html) investors, sending its stock down as much as 40%. 

Jared Holz, Mizuho health care equity strategist, said in an email Tuesday that the results on Viking’s drug “look inferior” to those of Eli Lilly’s pill “on almost all metrics.” 

Viking’s once-daily pill helped patients lose up to 12.2% of their weight at around three months, with no plateau, which means patients could lose even more in a longer-term study.

Holz pointed to the high rate of patients who discontinued Viking’s drug for any reason over 13 weeks, which was around 28%. Meanwhile, around a quarter of people discontinued Eli Lilly’s pill, orforglipron, for any reason over 72 weeks.

1mz7jm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1mz7jm5/asexual_but_hopelessly_craving_romance/,Asexual but hopelessly craving romance?,"I have struggled a lot over the years to understand and define my sexuality, but I think I have somewhat came to terms with the fact that I am asexual. 

I have never had any actual sexual attraction/feelings towards anyone (I don't think). The idea of having sex scares me a bit (mostly because it's an unknown act, and the social rules surrounding it are terrifying). I am a 25yo woman, and have never really engaged in any sexual activity (esp penetrative). 

However, recently I have been really struggling with the idea of being alone. I think I really crave romance and partnership. I am not sure whether being with someone would change my sexual preferences (greysexual), but regardless- I wish I could have a long term partner. I feel bi/pan-romantic, as I don't really have a preference when it comes to romantic/aesthetic attraction (though I have a preference for non-men).

I have been feeling incredibly alone, because I am not sure how many people do feel this way around me. Realistically, I am not living in a massive city - and it feels scary that I might never find someone whose attraction mirrors mine? I have been on dating apps and gone on some first dates, but never disclosed my asexuality (mostly bc I have been unsure of this myself). I usually don't see people again after the first date, cause I'm scared of the implications and I sometimes feel like I'm being an impostor by even going out for a coffee or walk. I do really crave connection though, and I don't think I'd mind kissing/hugging as praxis.

Does anyone have any advice? On how to navigate wanting romance whilst begin asexual? How to cope with the loneliness coming from this?",3,1756069669.0,asexuality,1,1.0,False

I just want to be able to put my feet up on the coffee table without a finish that melts into my socks like the restor a finish does, so I bought some polyurethane clear coat, then I found out that restor a finish ruins poly coat cures, great, now I'm a moron with a table that I'm not sure what to do with.

 What should I do? Can I just let the restor a finish fully dry for 30 days and then put a new shellac coat on, and then poly coat over that? Do I have to strip off everything? Is there something else I could use? The color is fine, the finish just melts and it leaves behind a sock imprint on the table if I leave my feet in the same spot for more than like 15 minutes, I already cleaned off the marks but now I'm not sure how to go about fixing this stupid mistake.",1,1756069562.0,finishing,1,1.0,False

1mz7gri,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1mz7gri/dim_kitchen/,Dim kitchen,"Hey, I love our dimly lit kitchen. It's probably because we're doing pretty shitty right now, that you're not turning the lights as often and losing my job isn't making this much fun. I loved working at the bakery. Though it was going to happen sooner or later. I can never shut my fucking mouth. Baby, I loved it, I loved it there so much, and as you lightly coo at me, peppering my head with kisses, I whimper.

""Can you tell me why?"" Your voice whispers into my burning ears. With that question, my sobbing grows louder, I sound like a-a ghost. Maximilliano, you idiot. I love that about you, but right now I don't even want to think about it.

Doesn't stop me from doing so. So I start. ""You remember my boss Ana-Lucia?""

""La rubia de ojos cafe, verdad?"" (the blonde with blue eyes?) he recalled her.

""Esa misma,"" (that same one).

""Well, what happened, amore? No, puedo entender, si no me dices nada,"" (I can't understand, if you don't tell me anything,).

""Max, estaba por la entrada, esa bruja me espero afuera, para darme las noticias,"" (Max, she was by the entrance, that witch was waiting for me outside, to give me the news).

""Well, what did she say to have you coming back here like a storm?""

""She said the customers were complaining about my face, I was not smiling at them and then others were complaining estupideces, that I was trying to steal their stupid husbands,"" (crap).

""¿Por eso te despidieron? Qué tonteria,"" (That's why they fired you? What nonsense,). His strong arms held me softly. 

""Max, I'm trying, pero no puedo con esto, soy una mierda,"" I cry into his shirt. (But I can't with this, I'm shit).

""Look Esme, this is just a temporary thing okay? Mirame, mirame, we're going to get out of this, my cousin Susie told me that you're more than welcome to work at her bodega,"" (look at me, look at me,). He gently wipes my tears, pressing his forehead against mine.

""You're working hard enough, Ana-Lucia puede comer mierda, look I'll talk to Susie and we can smooth things out with your school schedule,"" (can eat shit) He offered, though knowing him he was going to make sure Susie would give me that job.

It hadn't been long since we moved in together. We had been doing our best to work out our situation. Mother and father hadn't wanted me to see Maximillian because he was working construction.  They think I'll throw my education for love. Yet here I am, a third year in college doing as best as I can. This job was better than the previous one, and I worked for my uncle's mechanic shop. Though I quit because his customers were getting far too friendly with me.

He told me to knock it off and consider dating one of them because they seemed like better prospects when compared to my Max. I told Max that I quit because it was boring, if he knew the actual reason, bueno ni lo quiero imaginar, (well, I don't want to imagine).

While he kisses my curls the sound of the screeching coffee pot reminds of our day. heading over to the stove he grabs the pot and prepares his famous Cuban coffee.

""Listen to me Esme, work has been slow only because of the contractors, I'll be set by next week, okay? and don't think about anything unimportant, you have school, and that pretty paper you'll eventually have to prove your parents wrong,""

""It's not about that,""

""Yo se mi vida,"" (I know my love)

""Quiero que te queiran,"" (I want them to love you,)

""I'm fine with this, you love me and that's what counts,"" Max reassures me.

""Max, I need them too,"" I admitted.

""I know amore, I know, but this can't exactly be fixed over coffee and what is it that they eat in your country again?"" His soft voice now jovial. The small smile that came to my face as he used the word amore soothed me. The word itself was Italian and Central America adopted it through the Italian Diaspora. I knew for a fact that I didn't have an ounce of Italian blood in my veins even so it was pretty cool that we had a word designated to our partners that sounded softer than the typical amor. At least that's how I perceived it.

""Salpora's"" (Rice bread), I laugh at him. His gaze now focused on my smile.

""Exactly, once they find out you lost this job they'll say its my fault, and our heavenly father knows I'm being blamed unjustly, at least this time I won't be there to hear them call me a communist,"" He joked. Sighing, I couldn't help the laughter that erupted. Max always found a way to poke fun of the communist party Cuba, aware that that was the first thing people thought of when he mentioned his nationality. They assumed he was part of the communist party just for being Cuban. How outdated. I know they would hate to be called uneducated just because we're Honduran.

As he sets down our mugs on the table, he motions me forward with a wave of his hand. Following his lead he takes a seat and sets me on his lap.

""Esme, just breathe, it's saturday, now you can rest, ya que esa hija de puta te dejo ir, and instead we think about how to better occupy our time, okay?"" (now that, that daughter of a bitch let you go,) he kissed my cheek loudly. Sighing, I just nodded. His accent making me laugh once more, he sounded so righteous or serious when speaking spanish.

We'd get through this like we've been doing. And I don't mind the dimly lit kitchen. I think it sets a romantic mood. Although, I don't want to tell him, today is Saturday and who knows what's going in that head of his. ",2,1756069477.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False
1mz7gp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1mz7gp5/am_i_overthinking_or_should_i_set_boundaries/,Am I overthinking or should I set boundaries?,"This is my first time writing on reddit and I need advice on this situation. Also I'm sorry if some of my sentences don't make sense because english is not my first language. 

I have this friend (we’re both female 22, only close friend I have left since our group fell apart). She’s my best friend, but lately she’s been kinda unbearable. Yesterday we met for the first time since June. At Starbucks she said, “We’re gonna drink berry hibiscus, right?” but I wanted coffee, so I ordered an iced white mocha. She got annoyed, saying I should’ve told her, even though she doesn’t like coffee. Later while shopping, she insisted on buying the same t-shirt as me, but our styles are different so we didn’t. Then I had a store coupon but couldn’t find anything I truly liked. She pushed me to buy a shirt just to use the coupon, but I didn’t want to. So we left the store and I was so tired. We left the mall, got to the tram station and there was this gorgeous sunset and I have a short video assignment for one of my summer courses so I was filming the sunset. During when I was filming, her tram came and even though we usually hug goodbye, we didn't and I didn't mind it.

2 hours after arriving home she messaged me to say that basically she only insisted because we met to get this coupon thing done, when I changed my mind she felt like something was off. She just wanted to sort it out even though it was late. If I had explained myself at the moment she would have understood. Also she says that she's a bit hurt because she wanted to hug me goodbye but I was too focused on filming and didn't turn around. And at the end of the message she said if I explained things right away she won't overthink because she tends to blame herself otherwise. 

I know I was wrong for not hugging her goodbye but I really didn't think that it would be a big deal. I answered her message by saying that basically I don't like getting insisted on, and I was already tired at that point. The coupon wasn't urgent, it has one year validity. I didn't want to rush and buy something I wasn't fully sure about, I don't want to buy clothes to just sit in my closet. You are right about the filming thing, I could've returned but I was so focused on filming. I didn't realize it at the moment. And honestly I didn't think you would take it that way. I was just tired. 

After that we haven't talked for a day. But since yesterday I've reread the messages and thought about the day we had. I wrote the premise of the messages here because the original ones are not in english but rereading made me feel like she was waiting for an apology because she insisted on something and I shut her down. And secondly I kept re-thinking about the day and kinda realized that she was trying to do the same things as me. She wanted to buy not matching but same t-shirts, she wanted us to drink same drinks, when we sat down to eat she said “what are we going to eat, what are going to drink, what are we ordering”, she insists on me coming to her house and says “I’m gonna make you this meal, this drink, I’ve made you a gift I’m gonna give you when you come to my house.” Sometimes it feels like she wants us to do the exact same things and I feel like I am losing my individuality when I meet her. 

So I came here to ask you guys, what sould be my next step? Setting up boundaries or am I overthinking this situation? We've been friends for 8 years and I don’t want cut her off from my life, I already have only one friend.

- Burrata pastry: so good, I wish it was a little warmer, but the filling was flavorful from the tomato and balsamic, and delightfully creamy
-Flat croissant: sort of an impulse order, but really good. Chewy and not too sweet, and held up well as a leftover later
-Raspberry Berliner: good lord. The filling was a light cream that wasn't too sweet, but was tasty and completed the zingy raspberry jelly. The pastry itself was airy. 1000% will get again. 
-Feta and veg pastry: yummy, tart, and satisfying. Again, I wish it was a little warmer,  but still so good. 
-Chicken Samsa: not really for me, but the shortbread dough was delicious. I was a little put off by the texture of the ground chicken, but it was well spiced.
-Kosher sausage pirozhki: like a better pig in a blanket, and also not pork, so I could eat it. So tasty.
-Potato pirozhki: this one had the most warmed filling of all, and reminded me of a potato knish. I could see this being a real treat on a cold day. Very bready dough and a smooth filling.
We also had an Americano, which was good, and the service and friendliness of the staff sealed the deal on adding it to our favorite places. If you're in the area, I highly, highly recommend trying their pastries. I'll definitely return to try their meals as well!

1mz7a0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/GestationalDiabetes/comments/1mz7a0i/ftm_feeling_defeated/,FTM feeling defeated,"I am 28 years old and 29 weeks pregnant and just got diagnosed with gestational diabetes after failing the three hour glucose test. I have picked up my supplies to start checking my sugar and logging food but won’t see my OB until this upcoming Thursday to go over everything, but, I am feeling seriously defeated.

For reference, I have gained a total of 21 pounds so far. I am a server, and I’m on my feet walking and running around 8-9 hours a day 4 to 5 days a week. It’s healthy for me and I consider it a good amount of exercise on top of yoga/stretching I do at home. 

Anyways, part of me just doesn’t understand HOW I failed my glucose test(s). This entire pregnancy I have eaten SO well, probably better than I ever have in my entire life. I do not drink soda, juices, rarely eat fast food, I don’t splurge much on sweet treats, maybe once a week I’ll eat an ice cream bar or have a few cookies or something like that but nothing crazy. I prioritize protein, I only eat whole wheat or whole grain bread and healthy, low sugar cereals, snacks…etc. I eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Again, probably the best I’ve ever eaten in my life to avoid unnecessary weight gain as much as I can and for the health of the baby. It’s taken lots of self discipline but I do it. 

If I am already eating tons of protein, basically only drinking water/seltzer (besides a morning coffee), eating tons of fruits and veggies, lean meats, low sugar snacks, low carb breads, etc., what else can I do?! 

I am so frustrated. I have yet to start pricking my finger and seeing my levels (I will once I meet with my OB this week & a diabetes specialist), but damn! 

I guess I am just venting here…but I just don’t understand how this happened after I have prioritized healthy eating habits so much. I know it’s the placenta and not much I can do but what can I expect for these next 10 weeks if I’m already doing what I should be doing in terms of eating and exercise?! 

On top of this I am scared for my baby. Is she okay in there right now?! My OB’s don’t seem too concerned..just telling me to check my blood sugar and log my food and we’ll go from there. Ugh. Someone tell me it will all be ok.

1mz75yz,https://www.reddit.com/r/UserExperienceDesign/comments/1mz75yz/looking_for_design_feedback_of_my_journaling_app/,Looking for design feedback of my journaling app! Thank you!,"Hey fellow designers,

I've been lurking here for ages but finally have something worth sharing. After months of late nights and way too much coffee, I've built a voice journaling app that I'm actually pretty proud of. Its completely free to use (with a premium plan for longer limits and improved responses/analysis)

Like many of you, I've tried to maintain a journaling habit for years. I'd get inspired by someone like Marcus Aurelius (or let's be honest, some productivity guru on YouTube), buy a fancy notebook and some Japanese gel pens, write religiously for three days... and then completely abandon it. The physical act of writing just created this weird mental block.

But when I started voice journaling? Game changer. Speaking my thoughts felt natural, no filter between my brain and the page. So I built an app around that concept and its really helped me out. I use it both as a general journal for stuff like gratitude journaling in the morning and also to reframe how I think about stuff like relationships with my friends and social anxiety.

What makes this different from other journaling apps is the language analysis feature. It gently identifies patterns in how you talk about yourself and your experiences, then offers alternative phrasings that might shift your perspective. There is also a feature where you can create ""word(s) pairs(negative to positive) that will be highlighted in the transcription so users can more intentionally start using more empowering (or atleast, not as self-destructive) language.

Looks like this for all of my visual learners!

For example, if you vent about ""failing miserably"" at something, it might suggest reframing it as ""I learned what doesn't work."" Nothing preachy or judgmental, just subtle nudges toward more empowering language.

As UX designers, we know that the most powerful tools often fade into the background. That's what I've aimed for, something that feels like a supportive friend rather than another productivity app nagging you.

I'd love to get some honest feedback from fellow designers. What works? What doesn't? Where would you take this next, what features that could help people with their mental health struggles?

1mz6zhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mz6zhp/why_choose_simpure_replacement_water_filter_y7/,Why Choose SimPure Replacement Water Filter Y7 Series Review for Cleaner Water?,"I recently had the opportunity to test out the SimPure ROULP-2012-100-Y7, part of the SimPure Y7/Y7P Series, and I used it every day for about a month. Needless to say, water quality matters a lot in my household, not just because we consume it, but because the experience of clean, hassle-free filtration makes an everyday chore something you can almost ignore. This replacement water filter, boasting compatibility with the SimPure Y7, Y7P-W, and Y7P-BW Countertop RO systems, promises easy maintenance and high-quality filtration—but does it hold up? Here’s my take.

**Ease of Installation**  
The installation process for this filter was surprisingly painless. With its quick-change twist-in system, swapping out the filter took me less than ten minutes and required no additional tools. It’s an absolute boon if you’ve struggled with older or more cumbersome water filtration systems in the past. I actually replaced it while my kids were in the middle of afterschool snacks, and they had clean water running by the time they were done. That’s how effortless this was. 

[Check SimPure ROULP-2012-100-Y7 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0bgl2tpbz/)

**Performance and Quality**  
Performance is where any water filter really proves itself, and this one genuinely impressed me. The SimPure Y7/Y7P Series filter claims to improve water quality by reducing impurities and contaminants. Tested side by side with unfiltered tap water, the taste difference was undeniable. Everyone in my household—even the coffee fanatic (me)—commented on how much smoother beverages tasted.  

Throughout the trial, the freshness of the water remained consistent, which says a lot about its filtration ability. While I generally stick to municipal water, having this filter made me feel more comfortable drinking water straight from the faucet without double-guessing.

**Durability and Replacement Cycle**  
The manufacturer recommends replacing this filter every six months, though that number can vary depending on your water quality. I live in a city where the water isn’t overly hard, so I can see it lasting closer to the upper limit of that range. The RO smart indicator light that reminds you when it’s time for a replacement feels like a smart addition, particularly for forgetful folks like me—life gets busy, you know?  

**Key Benefits**  
- Tool-free, fast installation saves time and effort.  
- RO Smart Indicator light eliminates guesswork for replacements.
- Improves water’s characteristic taste by removing impurities and contaminants.  

**Areas of Concern**  
I do feel the filter comes with a couple of hurdles worth mentioning:  
- It’s only compatible with specific SimPure systems, which could pigeonhole users.  
- There’s no included user guide, which might leave less tech-minded individuals scratching their heads.  

**Build and Design Features**  
The SimPure ROULP-2012-100-Y7 is lightweight at just 14.4 ounces but doesn’t feel flimsy. Despite the carbon fiber build, which is not unusual for water filters, it holds up well in everyday use. Its seamless design also minimizes any chance of dreaded leaks—a relief since I’ve dealt with cheaply made filters in the past that made me nervous every time I walked into the kitchen.

**Competing Brands**  
When comparing this to other water filter systems, I’ve had my share of experience with brands like APEC or Aquagear. While APEC offers solid performance, its filters are nowhere as easy to swap out as this one. Aquagear, meanwhile, boasts a wider range of compatibility, which is notably missing here. However, neither offers something comparable to the RO Smart Indicator light, which eliminates replacement guesswork. It’s a mixed bag, but I see the SimPure filter appealing more to those who prioritize convenience above all.  

**Smart Spending**  
Considering the features this filter packs—an easy twist-in system, solid filtration capabilities, and long-lasting durability—it does feel like good value for its price point. Though there are cheaper brands on the market, you often lose quality or ease of use, and I’d argue this filter balances well between the two. However, it’s worth noting its somewhat limited compatibility. If you’re looking at this as a standalone investment, make sure it fits your specific system.

As someone who is reliably caffeinated thanks to a morning pour-over routine, I couldn't resist putting this drip-assist attachment to the test. With its promises of simplified coffee-making for both beginners and geeks alike, I figured it might just be the tool that turns a good cup of coffee into a fantastic one. Spoiler alert: it mostly delivered, but there’s a bit to unpack along the way.

**Craftsmanship and Design**

The design of the Hario PDA-02-T feels thoughtfully engineered to balance simplicity with function. It’s a clear, lightweight attachment that securely fits over standard 02 V60 coffee drippers. The construction feels sturdy yet not bulky, so it doesn't mess with the portability V60 fans often rave about. An extra feature that stood out to me was its symmetry. The multiple holes of varying sizes spaced along the drip-assist disk promote an even water flow—this is the key to optimization here. I was skeptical at first since I love the quirks that come with manual pouring, but the elegance in this simplicity quickly won me over.

[Check Hario PDA-02-T price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b08xbjnvqh/)

**Ease of Use for All Coffee Drinkers**

I’d heard ""no gooseneck kettle, no problem"" tied to this product, and while I rolled my eyes at first, the simplicity of it all made this a surprisingly accurate statement. I tested it with a standard kettle (purchased before my coffee snob days), and, as claimed, it produced an even brew without much finesse or fancy angling on my part. Pour 50-70ml into the center and wait a few seconds, then shift to the outer ring—as per the instructions—and somehow it just works. My teenage sibling, who views coffee as strictly functional, managed to make a cup that didn’t taste like mud. That says something.

**Positives**

- Even water distribution for consistent brewing results  
- Eliminates the need for precise pouring techniques  
- Lightweight and easy to clean  
- Compatible with most 02 V60 drippers  

**Performance and Brews Produced**

Now for the crucial test—how does the coffee actually taste? I’ve experimented with a variety of beans, roast profiles, and grinds over the two weeks I’ve used this product. Each time, the Drip-Assist produced an impressively balanced cup. The water flow naturally directs through its two-ringed design: the inner section ensures a steady center pour, while the outer ring adds depth and saturation. It’s perfect for eliminating those frustrating dry pockets of coffee grounds. For someone slightly impatient pre-caffeine, having an attachment that streamlines these nuances is a treat.

That said, the product doesn’t necessarily allow a lot of creative flexibility. For seasoned pour-over users like me who enjoy tweaking variables to explore flavor notes, the Drip-Assist feels a bit rigid. It’s reliable, but perhaps too reliable at times.  

**Negatives**

- Limited opportunities for advanced manual brewing techniques  
- Plastic construction dampens the premium feel  
- Might not appeal to people who already own a gooseneck kettle  

**Product Alternatives**

There are a few competitive options in the pour-over coffee tools space, especially products like the Fellow Stagg Pour-Over Set or Kalita Wave. While both alternatives prioritize precision much like the Hario Drip-Assist, they cater more to advanced users who enjoy the ritualistic aspects of coffee brewing. Compared to these, the PDA-02-T is much more user-friendly—it’s less intimidating for total newbies and doesn’t require investing in additional high-end tools like a gooseneck kettle. However, unlike the Kalita Wave's stainless steel durability, the Hario attachment feels more fragile.

**Value for Money**

This drip-assist accessory provides exceptional bang for the buck for folks wanting that dreamy pour-over flavor without overcomplicating the process. It’s definitely not for perfectionists who revel in hyper-controlled variables, but if convenience sits higher on your priority list, this thing is a steal. Plus, for what it does—making consistent brews accessible to anyone—it’s priced fairly.

1mz6r5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/1mz6r5s/my_fathers_cancer_story/,My father's cancer story.,"I come from a lower-middle-class family in India. My parents’ wages were just enough to put food on the table. I was only able to complete my college education because of scholarships. Eventually, I got a job, and with that stability, our family finally fulfilled a long-cherished dream—we built our own house. My father put in so much effort at the construction site, making sure everything was taken care of. When it was complete, we celebrated our housewarming with hearts full of joy.

But only weeks later, my father began complaining of persistent back pain. We went to the hospitals in our town, but they couldn’t help. So, we went to a metro city for proper diagnosis and treatment. The local doctors had already suspected arthritis, and even the senior doctor in the city hospital initially said the same. I wasn’t too worried since my company's medical insurance covered the expenses.

After a series of tests, we finally received the report one night. My mother couldn’t understand it, so she handed it to me. When I read it, I realized the truth—it was cancer. I held my emotions back, told my parents that the report was fine, and stepped out, saying I needed coffee. My cousin, who was with us, hadn’t seen the report, so I didn’t tell him either. We had coffee, but inside I felt empty. Later, he left, and I sat there, lost in thought.

That night, the hospital’s medical students were hosting a cultural program. I wandered in and found an empty seat. The hall was full of young people laughing, dancing, and enjoying themselves. In the middle of all that joy, I broke down and cried for an hour. Strangely, afterward, I felt a little lighter. I returned to my parents, still keeping the truth hidden from my mother to avoid panic.

The next day, I confided in my cousin, and we waited for the doctor. The doctor told us the devastating news: my father’s cancer was already stage 4 and beyond treatment. He said my father had only about six months left. I was shattered. Still, I wanted to try other hospitals, but after consulting several medical friends, I had to accept that my father’s condition was incurable.

We discharged him and took a cab home. On the way, we stopped at a crowded hotel for a meal. The three of us, my father in the middle, my mother on one side, and I on the other, sat at a table for six. Across from us was a family of three. My father, always a picky eater, struggled with the food, so I began feeding him. The family across noticed and kindly remarked that my father was blessed to have me as his son. Hearing that, I turned my face away and silently cried. The lady across the table seemed to understand that my father was suffering from an incurable disease. She teared up as well, sharing my pain in silence.

When we finally got home, the truth was revealed to my mother and aunts by my uncle. The entire household fell into despair. For two months, we tried everything: local herbal remedies, spiritual rituals, even superstitious cures, spending thousands in the process. But nothing helped. My father’s condition worsened as the cancer spread to his bone marrow, reducing his blood production.

Not out of mockery. Not out of denial.
🔥 They laugh because they’ve understood something simple and powerful:
“If everything is already uphill, I won’t put stones in my own shoes.”

And so they walk on.
With a smile sharper than any post-apocalyptic katana.
📂 Reports? Ready.
💊 Overmedication? Documented.
🧠 Severe agoraphobia? Officially recognized.
📉 The system? Exposed.

Because sometimes the greatest act of resistance is not to scream…
It’s to laugh while you keep solving.
To turn your fridge into a legal archive.
To print with dignity.

It demands logic, action, and maybe a coffee with someone who knows that not all tears are from sorrow…

1mz6pd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mz6pd4/social_life_to_shambles_while_in_depressions/,Social life to shambles while in depression's aftermath.,"Up until last year, I (F28) was as bright and social as a normal introvertedish individual can be. I had a lot of friends, most of them really close, a stable position in a nice job, a huge social life, and a 3.5-year relationship with someone who was actually close to most of said friends. In a span of six months, it all came down the drain. Exactly one year ago, I started showing symptoms of panic disorder and severe depression, and I was pretty firm with the idea of doing something dumb to my own life - which, of course, never happened (and I'm safe now, this is just a piece of context to this vent), but the aftermath led me into eating disorders, residual anxiety, and a complete change of life. 

I ended this relationship abruptly since I didn't feel held or seen during my times of hardship, and I saw this as a huge red flag - turns out it was the best decision I could make (I won't get into that, but I later discovered some nasty stuff about the dude). But even if this was a great decision, it turns out our shared friends (who were 95% of my social circle) decided to stay on the fence about the whole breakup situation, which eventually led to a growing distance between me and them. My social life basically went down the drain with the relationship.

After that breakup, someone who stood on his side started spreading rough lies about me to try and ""defend"" their friend (who, to be fair, didn't ask for that - but said person was interested in him and yadda yadda). While some people just faded away for being on the fence, others believed this person and started hating me for things I didn't do. 

Around the same time, I was accepted into the master's program of my dreams with a full scholarship. I quit my job to pursue this program, but I still do some freelance stuff for them, which pays the bills but it's not the same, socially speaking - I don't get to hang out by the coffee machine or get lunch with my coworkers, and my school colleagues have declared no interest in becoming acquaintances of any kind.

Yet, this new, exciting page of my academic life was enough to put me back on my feet. Suddenly, I didn't mind being alone or even being the villain in someone's story, even if it was based on unfair stuff. I started seeing it as deliberance, as something which freed me from people who would believe such things about me or who wouldn't be on my side in times of trouble. And, to be fair, that's about it. Being aware, too, of my own mistakes, I held my head up high and decided to live my life. 

As of now, I have just started a relationship with someone whom I've known for the past 20 years of my life. Things are looking up; he is a lovely person with a huge heart, and one of the smartest people I know. Has me wondering how I didn't see him around me all this time. Depression is still here, but tamed, as well as the panic attacks. Everything is normal enough - but so, so, SO lonely, despite me having found the love of my life and pursuing my dreams. I miss going out with girlfriends and chatting for hours. I miss spending nights on groupchats playing and watching dumb stuff. And most of all, I miss having people whom I can trust outside of my relationship.

I feel like a fish that's been caught from the ocean and placed in an aquarium - safe and warm, with nothing to fear, but missing most of the things that give life colour. Corals got replaced with plastic plants. And I wonder if that's what I should expect from adult life - 2 or 3 people whom I can trust, somebody to love and something to fill my time. Days are passing me by while everything feels the same. 

I'm currently in therapy, and while it does actually help a lot, it can't just spawn new friends in front of me. I feel like I started over a saved game - one on which I had taken a bad route and realized it after way too much time. No time is wasted and starting over is not bad, but it's frustrating nevertheless. And dealing with all the residual anxieties is hard when you're mostly alone - and I don't want to rely on my BF only, it would be unfair to him. After all, I wonder if I should pursue a lonely hobby, learn to make new friends after so much time, or just accept that adult life is lonely and that's it. :/",1,1756067705.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

But eventually stopped but I was tingly all over for the next 24 hours. Three days later my anxiety was high and I drank coffee bad idea😭 I ended up going to the hospital and I felt very sick. 

While I was in the waiting room I felt an orgasm build up for the next 20 minutes and I was terrified I was going to have one right there thank God I didn’t.

Bahrain’s Business Environment in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain Financial Harbour. continues to promote pro-business reforms, while initiatives from Tamkeen and MOICT reduce red tape and increase transparency.\
2025 in numbers:\
- GDP growth projected at 3.1% (Reuters, January 2025)\
- Over 1,800 new CRs (Commercial Registrations) issued in Q1\
- Office vacancy rates: 15-18% in central districts, 8-12% for top-tier space\
- Surge in fintech, logistics, and green energy business registrations\
\
Importantly, local business customs remain strong. Expect majlis-style meetings in Bahrain Bay offices, and don’t be surprised if you’re offered gahwa (Arabic coffee) before getting to contracts.\
\
Visit Bahrain’s official portal or Gulf News for ongoing regulatory news and economic updates.\
\
Typical Commercial Office Space Costs in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain office.:\
  - Rent: BHD 7.5 – 11.5 per sqm/month\
  - Example: A 120 sqm open-plan unit in Seef could run BHD 900–1,380/mo\
  - Service charge: BHD 1–1.5 per sqm/month extra (sometimes negotiable)\
- Grade B (older, less central):\
  - Rent: BHD 4 – 7 per sqm/month\
  - Example: 120 sqm in Diplomatic Area: BHD 480–840/mo\
Emerging & Peripheral Areas\
Sanabis, Hoora, Juffair, Tubli, Hamala\
\
Flexible space or shared offices:\
Co-working desks: BHD 60–130/mo\
\
Private serviced offices: BHD 180–400/mo for 2–4 people\
\
\
Retail/commercial shop space:\
\
Prime mall units (e.g., The Avenues): BHD 12–20/sqm/mo\
Neighborhood shops: BHD 3–5/sqm/mo\
\
Free Zones & Special Economic Clusters\
\
Bahrain Logistics Zone, BIIP, Airport Modernization Area:\
Typically lower base rent, but with licensing and utility fees\
Estimate: BHD 2.5–5/sqm/month\
See more on Bahrain Free Zone benefits.\
\
\
A frequent mistake: Underestimating ancillary costs! Service charges, parking, utilities, and fit-out expenses can tack on 15–30% above base rent.\
\
For a granular breakdown, check the Bahrain company formation cost guide.\
\
Factors Affecting Office Space Costs in Bahrain\
Not all office space is created equal. You’ll need to consider:\
\
Location prestige & accessibility (e.g. quick access to Sijilat, LMRA)\
Building grade, age, fit-out status (shell/core vs. turnkey)\
Parking (essential in Seef, negotiable in Juffair)\
Lease terms—flexible vs fixed, escalation clauses, rent-free periods\
\
Insider tip:\
Signing your lease just after Ramadan often means more flexible terms—landlords prefer to lock down tenants before the summer lull.\
\
Step-by-Step Guide: Renting Your First Bahrain Office\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation in Bahrain., not for retail or F&B\
- Check entity types and office rules here\
2. Shortlist Locations\
\
Prime access: Bahrain Financial Harbour for finance; Seef for tech & retail; Diplomatic Area for legal/consultancy\
Tip: Visit in person during late morning—traffic, parking, and even café availability all change by the hour.\
Insider trick: Avoid MOICT morning queues by arriving at 1:30pm (just after lunch, before closing).\
\
3. Document Preparation\
\
Documents needed:\
Company CR draft (from Sijilat portal)\
Lease agreement (must be in Arabic and English)\
Landlord ID/Ejar registration\
Tenancy contract attestation (done at Sijilat or Notary)\
Floor plan (certified)\
Shortcut: Some property agents pre-fill lease templates to speed up your Sijilat approval. Don’t hesitate to ask!\
\
4. Registration & Approvals\
\
Process flow:\
Sign lease\
Upload docs on Sijilat\
MOICT site visit (sometimes virtual in 2025)\
\
Get your CR\
\
\
Full process explained here\
\
Register your office/CR here\
\
5. Post-Registration Needs\
\
Utilities: Electricity & water (EWA) often require physical meter inspection\
LMRA registration: Needed for visas—office size affects quota\
Bookkeeping: Required for VAT and tax compliance\
Outsource to a Bahrain accounting pro\
\
\
(Personal aside: My first lease wasn’t notarized correctly. I lost three weeks before learning—always confirm attestation at Sijilat before paying your deposit.)\
\
\
2025 Regulatory Changes & Market Trends\
!(\
- From March 2025, MOICT requires all new CRs for consulting and financial services to submit a notarized lease and digital floor plan—no exceptions.\
Effect:\
- Major consultancies scrambled to update old paperwork during the Q2 rush. The EDB expects this move to tighten anti-money laundering controls and improve transparency (see Reuters analysis from April 2025).\
Policy Tip:\
- Keep digital and hard copies of every signed document—Sijilat and LMRA can (and do) request random audits six months after issuance.\
\
Ownership Structures and Office Space\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain.\
- 99% ownership breakdown and limits\
Implication for offices:\
- Some activities (banking, insurance, oilfield services) must lease in approved zones\
- For SMEs, co-working and virtual offices are often acceptable, reducing overhead\
- Mainland LLCs (WLLs) can use shared offices, but check if MOICT will accept your specific business activity at that address\
Comparison with UAE/Saudi Arabia:\
- Bahrain’s flexibility on foreign ownership and office requirements far outpaces Dubai’s mainline areas (which often require pricey mainland offices or local agents) and Riyadh’s Zone A districts (where supply is tight and costs are higher).\
\
Common Mistakes & Pro Tips\
The mistake I see most?\
Paying a deposit for a “flexi-desk” address before confirming the business activity is eligible for virtual office approval. You’re on the hook for a year’s non-refundable rent if MOICT says no.\
Prevention strategies:\
- Always cross-check with a local consultant or check MOICT guidance\
- Insist on a break clause in any flexible lease\
- Don’t rely on a business center’s promise—request written confirmation of eligibility\
Resource recommendation:\
- Keylink Business Hub offers bundled company formation and office rental packages—saving both time and money, especially if your Arabic is rusty or you’re setting up remotely.\
(Tangent: Did you know Bahrain’s business culture often involves lengthy, informal majlis meetings? I’ve closed more deals over qahwa and dates in the Diplomatic Area than in board rooms. These unwritten rules subtly shape how quickly you’ll get landlord approvals or even snag a rent discount.)\
\
Bahrain Company Formation: Office Space FAQs\
How much evidence of office space do I need to open a company in Bahrain?\
You must submit a signed lease and (from March 2025) a certified digital floor plan. Virtual offices are accepted only for eligible activities. Full process here.\
Can I use a co-working or virtual office address for my Bahrain company?\
Yes, but only for certain activities (consulting, IT, holding, some services). Retail, F&B, or manufacturing require traditional office/shop space. Check your activity on MOICT’s portal.\
Is it cheaper to rent in a free zone?\
Often yes, especially for logistics, fintech, and trade businesses. Free zones also offer easier visa quotas and sometimes reduced paperwork. More on Bahrain’s free zones.\
What is the biggest office rental mistake for new businesses?\
Signing a lease before confirming MOICT’s approval for your business activity at that address. Always get written confirmation before paying any deposit.\
Are there extra costs after signing the lease?\
Yes: expect 1-2 months’ deposit, service charges, fit-out costs, parking fees, and normally a broker commission. Detailed breakdown here: company formation cost guide.\
\
Starting a business in Bahrain?\
Prioritize your office location, verify every document, and lean into Bahrain’s unique business culture. Success is as much about relationships and local customs as it is about numbers on a lease.\
For tailored help and time-saving shortcuts, trust an advisor who knows both the written and unwritten rules of Bahrain’s business scene.\

1mz6kxj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mz6kxj,"Unlock Capital in 2025: RBF, Microloans, and Fintech Lenders Compared","# The 2025 Guide to Alternative Financing: RBF, Microloans, and Fintech Lenders Compared

Hey there, fellow entrepreneurs! Let's talk about something that's always on our minds: funding. For too long, the path to securing capital for our businesses felt like a one-way street leading straight to a traditional bank, with a gatekeeper demanding years of flawless credit history, a mountain of paperwork, and a whole lot of patience. But the world of business financing has undergone a seismic shift. The year is 2025, and the lending landscape is more diverse, accessible, and exciting than ever before. If you've been feeling frustrated by the old way of doing things, this guide is for you.

We're diving deep into the world of **alternative financing options**, a universe of funding that exists outside the traditional banking system. This isn't just a fleeting trend; it's the new reality for savvy small business owners who are leveraging modern solutions to fuel their growth. In this guide, we'll unpack three of the most powerful players in this new era: **revenue-based financing (RBF)**, microloans, and **fintech lenders 2025**. We'll explore how they work, who they're for, and how you can choose the right path for your unique business journey. So, grab a cup of coffee, and let's get ready to unlock the capital your business deserves.

# The New Age of Business Funding: More Than Just a Loan

The shift away from traditional banks isn't just about finding a new source of money. It's about finding a new kind of financial partner—one that understands the realities of modern business. Today's **alternative financing options** are built on a foundation of technology, data, and a deeper understanding of the diverse needs of small businesses.

We're seeing incredible innovation in this space. **Embedded finance**, for example, allows you to access funding directly through the platforms you already use to run your business, like Shopify or QuickBooks. Imagine getting a loan offer based on your real-time sales data, without ever having to fill out a separate application. That's the power of this new ecosystem.

Artificial intelligence is also playing a huge role, with AI-driven underwriting processes that can assess your business's health more holistically than a simple credit score. This means that even if your business is young or you don't have a lot of assets, you can still be seen as a great candidate for funding. It's a more inclusive, data-driven approach that's opening doors for more entrepreneurs than ever before.

# Deep Dive: Revenue-Based Financing (RBF)

First up is one of the most talked-about **alternative financing options** for growing businesses: **revenue-based financing (RBF)**. If you have a business with consistent, predictable revenue, this could be a game-changer for you.

# What It Is and How It Works

At its core, RBF is a unique model where you receive a lump sum of capital from an investor, and in return, you agree to pay back that amount, plus a flat fee, through a percentage of your future monthly revenue. It's not a loan in the traditional sense, and it's not an equity investment. You don't give up any ownership of your company.

Here's a simple example: Let's say an RBF provider gives you $100,000 with a 1.2x repayment cap and a 10% repayment rate. This means you'll pay back a total of $120,000. Each month, you'll pay 10% of your gross revenue until the full $120,000 is repaid.

* **In a great month where you make $50,000 in revenue**, your payment is $5,000.
* **In a slower month where you make $20,000**, your payment is just $2,000.

This flexibility is the magic of RBF. Your payments ebb and flow with your cash flow, which can be a lifesaver for businesses with some seasonality or fluctuating monthly income.

# The Pros of RBF

* **Non-Dilutive:** This is a big one. You get the capital you need to grow without giving up any equity or control of your company. You remain the sole captain of your ship.
* **Flexible Payments:** As we saw in the example, payments are tied to your revenue, which protects your cash flow during slower periods.
* **Aligned Incentives:** RBF providers are your partners in growth. They only get paid back faster if your revenue increases, so they're invested in your success.
* **Speed:** The application and funding process for RBF is typically much faster than traditional loans or venture capital, often taking just days or weeks.

# The Cons of RBF

* **Can Be More Expensive:** The flat fee structure can sometimes translate to a higher overall cost of capital compared to a traditional loan, especially if you pay it back quickly.
* **Requires Consistent Revenue:** RBF is not for pre-revenue startups or businesses with highly unpredictable income. You'll need to show a track record of consistent sales.
* **Not for Every Business Model:** This model is best suited for businesses with high gross margins, like SaaS, e-commerce, and subscription-based companies.

# Best Practices for Seeking RBF

* **Know Your Numbers:** Have a clear understanding of your monthly recurring revenue (MRR), customer acquisition cost (CAC), and lifetime value (LTV).
* **Have a Growth Plan:** Be prepared to show potential RBF partners exactly how you'll use their capital to generate more revenue.
* **Compare Offers:** Don't just look at the repayment cap. Consider the repayment rate and how it will impact your monthly cash flow.

# Deep Dive: Microloans

Next, let's talk about a powerful option for startups and businesses in underserved communities: microloans. These small loans are making a big impact.

# What They Are and Who Offers Them

Microloans are exactly what they sound like: small loans, typically ranging from a few hundred dollars to $50,000. They are often provided by non-profit organizations, community development financial institutions (CDFIs), and through programs like the Small Business Administration (SBA) Microloan Program.

The goal of microlenders is often mission-driven. They aim to support entrepreneurship in communities that may have been overlooked by traditional lenders, including women-owned, minority-owned, and veteran-owned businesses.

# The Pros of Microloans

* **Accessibility:** Microloans are often easier to qualify for than traditional loans, with more flexible credit requirements.
* **Smaller Loan Amounts:** Sometimes, you don't need a massive infusion of cash. Microloans are perfect for covering smaller expenses like purchasing inventory, buying a new piece of equipment, or launching a marketing campaign.
* **More Than Just Money:** Many microlenders also provide valuable mentorship, training, and resources to help you succeed. They are truly invested in your growth.

# The Cons of Microloans

* **Higher Interest Rates:** While often more accessible, microloans can sometimes come with higher interest rates than traditional bank loans to offset the increased risk for the lender.
* **Smaller Loan Amounts:** The very nature of a microloan means it may not be sufficient for businesses with larger capital needs.
* **Application Process Can Still Be Detailed:** While more flexible, you'll still need to present a solid business plan and financial projections.

# Best Practices for Applying for a Microloan

* **Craft a Strong Business Plan:** This is your roadmap to success and a key document for any microlender.
* **Connect with Local Organizations:** Reach out to your local SBA office or CDFIs to learn about the microloan programs available in your area.
* **Be Prepared to Tell Your Story:** Microlenders are often interested in the ""why"" behind your business. Be ready to share your passion and your vision.

# Deep Dive: Fintech Lenders

Finally, let's explore the dynamic and fast-paced world of **fintech lenders 2025**. These online lenders are leveraging technology to make business financing faster and more convenient than ever before.

# The Fintech Revolution in Lending

Fintech lenders are financial technology companies that have streamlined the lending process from start to finish. They use sophisticated algorithms to analyze a wide range of data points, from your online sales and accounting software to your social media presence, to get a comprehensive view of your business's health.

This data-driven approach allows them to make faster, more accurate lending decisions, often in a matter of hours. They offer a wide array of **alternative financing options**, including:

* **Term Loans:** A lump sum of cash that you repay in regular installments over a set period.
* **Lines of Credit:** A flexible pool of funds that you can draw from as needed, only paying interest on the amount you use.
* **Invoice Financing:** A way to get an advance on your unpaid invoices, which can be a lifesaver for managing cash flow.
* **Merchant Cash Advances:** An advance on your future credit card sales.

# The Pros of Fintech Lenders

* **Speed:** This is the hallmark of fintech lending. You can often apply online in minutes and receive funding in as little as 24 hours.
* **Convenience:** The entire process is typically done online, from application to funding.
* **Flexible Eligibility:** Fintech lenders are often more willing to work with businesses that don't meet the strict criteria of traditional banks.

# The Cons of Fintech Lenders

* **Higher Costs:** The speed and convenience of fintech lending can come at a price, with higher interest rates and fees than traditional loans.
* **Shorter Repayment Terms:** Repayment periods are often shorter, which can mean higher monthly payments.
* **Less Personal Relationship:** The online nature of fintech lending means you may not have the same personal relationship with your lender as you would with a local bank or credit union.

# Best Practices for Choosing a Fintech Lender

* **Shop Around:** With so many fintech lenders out there, it's crucial to compare offers and understand the total cost of borrowing.
* **Read the Fine Print:** Pay close attention to interest rates, fees, and repayment terms.
* **Check Reviews and Reputation:** Look for lenders with a strong track record of positive customer experiences.

# Head-to-Head Comparison: Which Option is Right for You?

To help you visualize the differences, here's a quick comparison of our three alternative financing power players:

|Feature|Revenue-Based Financing (RBF)|Microloans|Fintech Lenders|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Loan Amount**|$10k - $5M+|Up to $50,000|$5k - $500k+|
|**Repayment**|Percentage of monthly revenue|Fixed monthly payments|Fixed payments or based on sales|
|**Speed**|Fast (days to weeks)|Slower (weeks to months)|Very Fast (hours to days)|
|**Cost**|Medium to High (flat fee)|Low to Medium (interest rate)|Medium to High (interest rate + fees)|
|**Ideal Candidate**|High-growth, high-margin businesses with predictable revenue|Startups, underserved entrepreneurs, businesses needing small capital|Businesses needing fast cash, strong online presence, or don't qualify for traditional loans|

# The Future is Hybrid: Building Your Custom Capital Stack

One of the most exciting trends in **alternative financing options** is the idea of ""stacking"" different types of funding to create a custom capital solution for your business. For example, you might use a microloan to get your business off the ground, then bring on an RBF partner to fund a major marketing push, and maintain a fintech line of credit for unexpected expenses.

The key is to think strategically about your funding needs at each stage of your business's growth and to not be afraid to mix and match different options to create the perfect financial foundation for your success.

# Your Path to Growth in 2025 and Beyond

The world of small business financing has been democratized. No longer are we at the mercy of a single, rigid system. The rise of **revenue-based financing (RBF)**, microloans, and **fintech lenders 2025** has put the power back in the hands of entrepreneurs.

The most important takeaway from this guide is that you have options. The best financing solution for your business is out there, and it's likely not the one-size-fits-all approach of the past. By understanding the nuances of these modern funding methods, you can confidently choose a financial partner that aligns with your vision, supports your growth, and celebrates your success.

So, take a close look at your business, your goals, and your cash flow. Do your research, ask questions, and don't be afraid to explore the incredible world of **alternative financing options**. The future of your business is bright, and the capital you need to get there is within reach.

Maintaining a comprehensive oral hygiene routine is the cornerstone of a healthy, confident smile and overall well-being. Many people underestimate the profound impact that proper dental care can have on their health, overlooking the critical connection between oral hygiene and total body wellness. A well-designed oral care strategy goes far beyond simply brushing your teeth – it's a holistic approach that involves multiple steps, techniques, and consistent dedication to maintaining optimal oral health.

Understanding the Foundations of Oral Hygiene

Oral hygiene is more than just a quick brush twice a day. It's a comprehensive approach to maintaining the health of your teeth, gums, and entire mouth. **Proper oral care prevents numerous dental and health issues**, including:

• Tooth decay
• Gum disease
• Bad breath
• Tooth loss
• Systemic health complications

The Science Behind Oral Health

Research shows that poor oral hygiene can lead to serious health problems. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 47.2% of adults aged 30 and older have some form of periodontal disease. This statistic underscores the critical importance of maintaining a rigorous oral hygiene routine.

Essential Components of an Effective Oral Hygiene Routine

1. Brushing Techniques: The Cornerstone of Dental Care

Proper brushing is the foundation of any oral hygiene routine. **Experts recommend brushing for at least two minutes, twice daily**, using the following techniques:

• Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
• Hold the brush at a 45-degree angle to the gums
• Use gentle, circular motions
• Clean all surfaces of the teeth
• Replace your toothbrush every three to four months

Choosing the Right Toothbrush and Toothpaste

Selecting the appropriate dental tools is crucial for optimal oral hygiene. Look for:

• Soft-bristled brushes
• Fluoride toothpaste
• Toothbrushes with comfortable grips
• Electric toothbrushes for more effective cleaning

2. The Critical Role of Flossing

Many people overlook flossing, but it's an essential component of a proper oral hygiene routine. **Flossing removes plaque and food particles that brushing can't reach**, preventing:

• Tooth decay
• Gum inflammation
• Potential tooth loss
• Bad breath

Flossing Techniques for Maximum Effectiveness

• Use about 18 inches of floss
• Gently slide between teeth
• Curve the floss around each tooth
• Use a clean section of floss for each tooth
• Floss at least once daily

3. Mouthwash: The Extra Layer of Protection

A quality mouthwash provides additional benefits to your oral hygiene routine:

• Kills bacteria
• Freshens breath
• Reaches areas brushing and flossing might miss
• Helps prevent tooth decay

• Limit sugary and acidic foods
• Drink plenty of water
• Eat calcium-rich foods
• Avoid excessive coffee and tea
• Consume crunchy fruits and vegetables

Professional Dental Care

Regular dental check-ups are crucial:

• Schedule bi-annual dental cleanings
• Get professional x-rays
• Address potential issues early
• Receive personalized oral hygiene advice

I always assumed I was being reasonable with money, bills were covered, no crazy splurges. But the truth is, I never realized how much the small stuff was eating away at me.

A couple months ago I decided to track literally every expense. Not just rent and groceries, but also the $5 snacks, random Amazon buys, late-night takeout. It felt silly at first, like nitpicking.

Then the numbers smacked me in the face: what I thought was maybe $200 a month eating out was actually closer to $450.

Once I saw it in black and white, it didn’t feel like deprivation, more like plugging leaks in a sinking boat. Brew coffee at home, cook a few more meals, stop the little impulse buys… and suddenly I had way more left over at the end of the month.

I am considering opening a business in Santa Maria. Originally from Santa Ana, CA spent 2013-2024 living in San Luis Obispo before purchasing a house near Betteravia and Miller. I love Santa Maria because it gives you the central coast life and also reminds me of home. However, often I find myself trying to enjoy something casual, hang out spot vibes, but prefer supporting something locally owned but it’s been really hard to find somewhere casual to drink or enjoy a good coffee that are not chains. More often than not I enjoy settling for Starbucks, Dutch Bros, Buffalo Wild Wings, or a slew of other bigger chain spots. Not my vibe.

I remember when the Santa Maria Brewery was open on the north side of town and I enjoyed that spot until this closed. 

I follow the trends that younger generation isn’t drinking all that much but I believe the city could support a pub house, beer garden, etc. without having to drive to Orcutt; which I enjoy since I have friends that live on that side of town but gets tiring driving over there when there’s a lot of potential in Betteravia area. 

All that being said; for those that grew up in this area or live in the Betteravia and Miller area, would you prefer a beer garden/pub house (with food) or locally owned coffee shop that perhaps also sells cocktails (saw a very cool concept when I was in North Carolina).

The design industry just got hit by a tsunami.

GenSpark AI Designer is that tsunami.

Traditional agencies charge $50,000 for complete branding packages.

GenSpark AI Designer delivers the same results for less than your lunch money.

But price is just the beginning.

GenSpark AI Designer is faster, more consistent, and infinitely more scalable than human designers.

The writing is on the wall.

Adapt or die.

# The GenSpark AI Designer Disruption Nobody Saw Coming 🌊

Design agencies had a good run.

Decades of charging premium prices for creative work.

Protected by the complexity of design software.

Shielded by the mystique of ""creative expertise.""

GenSpark AI Designer just pulled back the curtain.

Design isn't magic.

It's pattern recognition applied to visual communication.

And AI is better at pattern recognition than humans.

GenSpark AI Designer proves this every time it creates professional brands in seconds.

The company behind GenSpark AI Designer shows what's possible.

$36 million in annual revenue in 45 days.

20 employees total.

$1.8 million in revenue per employee.

These numbers are impossible with traditional business models.

They're only possible when AI eliminates human bottlenecks.

GenSpark AI Designer is that elimination in action.

# What Traditional Agencies Can't Compete With 💥

Traditional design agencies have fundamental limitations.

GenSpark AI Designer doesn't.

**Human Energy Limits** Designers get tired. They have bad days. They lose motivation. GenSpark AI Designer never gets tired. Never has bad days. Never loses focus.

**Human Speed Limits**  
Even the fastest human designer needs hours for professional work. GenSpark AI Designer delivers professional results in seconds.

**Human Consistency Limits** Human work quality varies based on mood, energy, and inspiration. GenSpark AI Designer delivers consistent professional quality every time.

**Human Scale Limits** Agencies need more employees to handle more projects. GenSpark AI Designer handles unlimited projects simultaneously.

**Human Cost Limits** More human designers mean higher costs. GenSpark AI Designer costs stay flat regardless of project volume.

These aren't minor advantages.

They're fundamental disruptions that make traditional agencies uncompetitive.

I tested GenSpark AI Designer against the types of projects agencies charge thousands for.

Premium chocolate brand identity. Coffee shop interior design. Social media campaigns. Product packaging. Website layouts.

GenSpark AI Designer delivered professional results in minutes.

Results that would take agencies weeks and cost thousands.

The quality difference? Minimal.

Are you?",1,1756066662.0,AISEOInsider,0,1.0,False
1mz68wr,https://www.reddit.com/r/EU5/comments/1mz68wr/infodump_from_generalist_gamings_qna_stream/,Infodump from Generalist Gaming's QNA stream yesterday,"[Here's the stream, but it's four hours long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxxh4J0ruLw). Generalist Gaming also has early access and has a lot more experience in the game than most other content creators. I went through the stream and wrote down his thoughts.

# General Impressions

* Generalist is enjoying the game (I sure hope so)
* Overall enjoying EU5 considerably more than Vic3 currently and thinks it's probably a better game than Vic3 in the abstract
* The game will be ready for November 4th release but people will have complaints
* EU5 is exponentially better for roleplay than EU4 since you don't need to be optimal to survive
* The systems are solid and most issues still remaining are polish/balancing issues rather than fundamental problems with the game design
* AI will be improved but probably not to the level where people get challenged super hard

# Government & Politics

**Parliament System**

* Parliament to increase levies is very strong early on but then it falls off and becomes totally worthless
* Playmaker and Generalist look at the game a lot differently. Playmaker says he thinks parliament is power creep and it's all overpowered, Generalist disagrees and thinks Playmaker just doesn't like the parliament mechanic

**Crown Power & Estates**

* Each loan gives you -3% crown power
* Crown power balance is really substantive because it decreases your income
* Taking loans when below 25 crown power will feel ""turbo bad""
* Estates build buildings themselves sometimes, which can sometimes be pretty bad for your country
* It might be good to not tax estates so they build better buildings
* There's a massive ""Court and Country"" situation/disaster in the Age of Absolutism that revolves around wrestling control of your country from the estates

**Subjects & Diplomacy**

* Vassals are extremely loyal, way too loyal according to Generalist. It's very easy to maintain control over vassals even when they have 10x your population. This might be because the opinion system is bugged, according to Generalist your opinion of subjects decreases instead of theirs of you. The same applies to allies.
* Subject integration is slow in the first age but speeds up later, the optimal expansion strategy is through vassals rather than direct conquest
* Personal unions are ""really common"" but full annexation through PU is relatively rare

# Country-Specific

**Asian Powers**

* Yuan seems fully railroaded to experience Red Turban Rebellion
* Strategy is to build only in the northern market around Beijing to retain control
* Yuan gets ""minus 100 conscripts"" (whatever that means) when the war starts, making them highly dependent on Korea and subjects
* Korea is maybe top 5 globally because of tribute from Yuan, good expansion options, and excellent resources
* Vijayanagar is probably the second strongest start in the game

**European Powers**

* Brandenburg has been seriously nerfed since the last dev build, it's easier to form Prussia as the Teutons currently
* England is strong due to high wool density (good for food and industry), but France has more land, better terrain for control, and more premium resources (silver, dyes, silk). Castile has decent resources and strong expansion potential, especially into North Africa, but is probably weaker in resource density compared to the other two. France is probably the best Western European country overall due to land, resources, and advances
* Hungary is the best beginner country since they start out pretty big with most of their territory in a single market
* Poland has really strong advances despite not having the best starting resources
* Sweden looks pretty strong but has pop problems
* Denmark has really low pops and limited viability
* The Netherlands ran out of pops when Generalist's tried playing them and it sucked pretty hard
* Florence has ""turbo zero food"" but lots of other good resources
* Granada's survival is ""really high variance,"" sometimes they get annexed pretty quickly and other times they stick around a very long time (usually when they ally Morocco)
* Naples is probably the best Italian nation for unification due to best content and capital location
* Milan has very limited food but lots of other good resources
* Not sure if Austria gets a free PU over Hungary

**Russian/Eastern European Powers**

* Muscovy/Russia is super weak relative to historical position because of terrible resources, low pops, not great terrain, and the Little Ice Age. Generalist suggests giving them better advances to balance them out
* When it comes to the Tatar yoke, the Golden Horde usually collapses and you can break free after about 100 years
* You can form the Commonwealth as Poland
* Lithuania can both blob and implode depending on the game
* Romania is one of the best places to build a power base because of the abundance of flat land to build up in and rare resources in neighboring regions
* You can form Russia but Generalist hasn't seen it happen in his games (probably because Muscovy is so weak)

**African Powers**

* Mali is Generalist's favorite nation and playing a New World-colonizing game as them is really fun
* Morocco always gets attacked by Castille very early on
* Ethiopia has really rough terrain but good resources (coffee, lots of gold, lumber). They can eventually get strong through unopposed expansion and have some of the best gold density

**Regions**

* Tibet is probably the absolute worst start if you want to suffer
* The Middle East has generally bad resources, Arabia is the worst region to start out with
* North Africa (Morocco, Tunisia, etc.) is probably stronger than in EU4
* Asia is such a huge continent that regional assessment is difficult
* Europe is probably the second-worst continent for resources overall
* Italy is the most situation-dense region in the game with about 6 situations specifically revolving around them

# Population & Development

**Population Mechanics**

* Food storage number is proportional to the amount of pops you have, so when you have lower pops you grow a little bit more
* Prosperity is one of the big drivers of pop growth, Generalist estimates like, 40% of growth is from prosperity
* On average, you'll probably be around 0.4% population growth annually. You can't really do much to directly help it, maybe move the needle from 0.3% to 0.45-0.5% annually
* There's an upper limit to population per location based on terrain and vegetation (farmland gives most, mountains are terrible).
* Pops grow until they hit a soft cap, then stop, but you can increase the cap through buildings and push out migration
* Pop growth can get to 2.5% in really low population areas when colonizing due to settlement buildings
* Settlement buildings give +1% population growth in very low pop areas, and you can get another +1% in extremely low pop situations
* Pop migration only happens within your own market, not between markets (besides events)
* Europeans can get more population by colonizing since the sent pops have higher growth rates
* You can completely depopulate your country
* You probably won't reach a billion pops by endgame

**Slavery**

* You can avoid participating in the slave trade as a European colonizer, but only ""if you hate winning""
* You can wage wars specifically for slave raiding using a CB. Each time you occupy a location, you take around 1-5% of the population as slaves
* If slaves convert to your religion, they become free at a higher rate per month
* If you accept slave cultures, the slaves are released
* Slave pops don't die out faster than other pops
* Christians can build slave centers in other countries (if they have more power projection) that force those countries to take slaves
* Europeans have to do a triangle trade where Muslims in West Africa take non-Muslim slaves, then Europeans import them to the colonies and use the profits to import more slaves
* Christians can't import Christian slaves, only non-Christian ones
* Taking slaves is a ""pretty big deal"" and Christian religions' inability to do so makes them ""turbo weak"" relative to Muslim neighbors
* Hellenics are Christian so they can't take slaves (I think the original question was about the Hellenic religion, but Generalist read it as Greek culture)

**Culture & Religion Conversion**

* Culture conversion is very slow and you need to hit over 50% to make progress. Generalist doesn't think it's feasible to 100% assimilate a province
* Converting religion can make culture conversion faster indirectly by raising satisfaction
* Culture conversion is throttled by how many pops there are total
* You can expel pops from a province using a cabinet action, making them migrate out

# Military & Warfare

**Army Composition & Tactics**

* Discipline works the same as EU4, tactics is also really good
* Cavalry is more pop efficient but much more expensive than infantry
* Mercenaries exist and are the best military option before regulars
* Levies will ""ruin your economy"" in Europe due to pop constraints, but work fine in high-pop regions like India
* There are dice rolls in battles

**Naval Warfare**

* Navy is important but not very dynamic in usage. The best strategy is to stack your navy in a mega stack and then hunt the opponent's stack if you're bigger than it, or just hide your navy if you're not

**Warfare Effects & Mechanics**

* You lose prosperity when armies march through or fight in provinces, which can eventually decrease development
* Mountain forts are pretty broken right now since you can siege them in winter but can't attack them, and attrition while sieging is bugged
* You can bribe people out of wars (though Generalist hasn't tried it much)
* Making peace is apparently broken due to allies demanding too much or bribing issues
* You can do separate peace in wars and it eats into total war score cost
* You can take everything in a peace deal up to 100% warscore through separate peace deals

**Multiplayer Strategy**

* Blobbing is an awful strategy in multiplayer because it makes you look scarier than you actually are. the absolute worst thing to be in MP is a paper tiger, you want to appear not scary at all.
* England will really shine in multiplayer because you don't need a standing army and can focus resources elsewhere with your navy as protection

# Religion & Technology

**Religious Systems**

* The Muslim religions are probably the strongest because they can take slaves
* Christian religions are ""extraordinarily weak"" compared to others when just looking at the mechanics because they have to rely on importing slaves from places like Mali rather than taking them directly (Keep in mind that the countries that are Christian have their own sets of advantages and disadvantages, Generalist doesn't think they should get buffed)
* Eastern religions comparatively are pretty good, Generalist thinks Hindu is the 2nd best religion because of research speed bonuses
* Each religion has around 70 unique techs
* Catholic religion feels weird to engage with. You can get saints and vote on papal stuff but it seems generally weak
* Shaping your state religion as Protestant is fun
* Orthodox has different patriarchates and you pass laws for your particular one, plus a ""Third Rome"" event that he didn't elaborate much on

**Technology & Research**

* Institutions tend to spawn in Europe and spread through trade, which is how Europeans get technological advantages, but it gets smaller over time as Eastern countries catch up. By endgame, Eastern countries might even pull ahead due to better research speed bonuses
* No tech groups like in EU4
* Latin doesn't maintain supremacy as a liturgical language like it did in May build, the research speed bonus was reduced from a full point to 0.2
* Tech costs 25 research points, decreasing if you're an age ahead

# Colonization

**Mechanics & Strategy**

* Colonization before 1400 is really not possible in any real capacity. You're just wasting pops and money
* Colonization isn't especially interesting and they turbo-nerfed the rate at which your subjects use the dev province interaction which makes colonial nations weaker compared to the last build
* You can choose to keep colonial territory or release it as a subject when colonization completes
* Colonial nations aren't locked to the New World, you can create them anywhere on a different continent
* Colonization is probably too weak currently and takes too long to pay out
* The AI doesn't colonize much because they don't make enough money
* Distance matters a lot for colonization difficulty
* Generalist completely disagrees that islands are too hard to colonize. he thinks people are just colonizing islands that are too far away.
* You get 4 free buildings if you create a colonial nation immediately upon finishing colonization
* Places with existing large populations (20k+) take forever to colonize
* You can choose different laws for how to treat natives during colonization (integrate, expel, enslave)

**Colonial Administration**

* Colonial nations adopt your culture and religion
* There are no colonial cultures
* Colonies can't fail until you choose to pull out, but you can get events that make them fail
* You can rush to India trade by colonizing low-population provinces along the way to get the range
* Trade companies are more interesting than colonial nations because you can build special buildings in them
* You can rename colonial nations

# Economy & Trade

**Resource Management**

* Resources cannot be depleted
* You can stockpile resources
* Mercury is the rarest resource in the game
* Lumber is pretty ubiquitous, if you don't have 3-4+ lumber in your market, you'll experience problems
* Some RGOs are dynamic
* The Columbian Exchange is ""hyper-dynamic"" and changes RGOs, most noticeably in Africa, India and North America
* Base cap of some goods may change every age

**Food Resources**

* Wool gives 5 food per RGO and has a base price of 2.5, making it one of the better food resources alongside rice
* Rice gives the absolute most food (around 10), wheat gives around 8, legumes and most other food RGOs give around 5, wild game gives around 3
* Coffee has low supply pretty much everywhere in the Old World so will be very expensive before Columbian Exchange

**Trade System**

* Trade is no longer overpowered
* You can't manipulate prices through tariffs and taxes like in Victoria 3
* You can't import goods from a colonial nation that would put them into a deficit
* Markets trade directly with each other
* You can chain trade but it's less efficient than direct importing
* Low market access raises sell prices but doesn't lower production amounts (this may have changed recently)
* You don't get tax from RGOs based on lack of market access

**Financial System**

* There is no investment pool
* Loans are usually from estates and interest is insane
* The estate might get the money you pay in interest

# Infrastructure & Development

**Building & Construction**

* Building automation by the AI is really bad, but trade automation is trustworthy. Managing 300+ locations for construction will be really rough without better automation
* AI tries to build buildings that are profitable
* Construction goods aren't expensive enough, so the AI doesn't build enough of them, allowing players to get buildings much cheaper (33% cost vs AI's 120%)
* Building costs aren't like Vic3 buy orders, they're just throttled costs, so it stimulates the economy less
* Generalist wants an auto-expand feature for buildings
* The strategies that Generalist advocated in earlier videos that revolved around using the dev province cabinet action got nerfed into the grand since the last build he got access to. It's only about 20% as effective as it was earlier this year. He thinks solely using your cabinet to increase dev and integrate provinces is not a good strategy anymore and you should use a variety of cabinet actions

**Markets & Control**

* For every point of development, you get minus one proximity cost, which is enormous (basically more control)
* You can dissolve markets but it costs -50 to -80 stability. You don't want to delete markets as much as just move them around
* Naval infrastructure doesn't provide market access
* The control decay system has issues, it decays at 1/5th the speed of increases

**Transportation Infrastructure**

* Rivers in general are really important because you can build a padlock canal for 5% reduction and also a bridge for another 5% reduction
* You need a road to build a bridge
* Proximity cost from your capital is affected by the terrain you're moving OUT of, not into
* You want flatland grassland for your capital, probably not even farmland
* Farmland has the most pop capacity but worse proximity cost for pushing control
* Coastal capitals are generally pretty good but aren't necessarily always the best
* Terrain matters much less if you're primarily using maritime control propagation
* Late game roads become extremely powerful, allowing control pretty much anywhere
* Sand is useful for glass production early on and later for road construction

# AI & Performance

**AI Behavior**

* People on the forums (PDX forums specifically) are way too doomer about balance and the AI according to Generalist
* The AI is ""way better"" at microing armies and punts off stacks less frequently
* The AI is ""pretty bad at eco in a variety of ways""
* The AI builds way too many forts which eats up their early game profit margins
* The AI asks for ""stupid amounts of money from you,"" probably because it's scaling on your income rather than theirs
* Subject relations balancing seems like an easy fix before launch
* Generalist thinks the AI will be improved but not necessarily to the level some people want

**Performance & Technical**

* Performance starts degrading around 1700 but stays playable even on minimum spec machines
* Hour ticks don't slow the game down at all since they're only used to calculate battles
* The game runs much better now than earlier builds
* Generalist has abandoned a game because of performance in the later years (barely above minimum reqs)

# UI & User Experience

**Interface**

* UI still needs work but is ""so much better than it was in May""
* You can rename locations but that's about it. You can't even rename units currently, but Generalist said he expects that to be fixed before the game releases
* You can pan camera with WASD, arrow keys, or scroll
* All the clicking and interaction feels more responsive than previous games
* Ambient sounds and interface are ""wonderful""
* The UI for market access (esp. rivers) is ""not very good"" and ""relatively opaque"" but it's an important mechanic

**Game Features**

* Works of art feel underwhelming and opaque in terms of value
* Characters other than royal family, counselors, and generals aren't very influential
* There are no different start dates and you probably shouldn't expect any after the game comes out
* Releasing banking countries might be possible as there's a tab for building-based countries in subject creation

# Game Design & Philosophy

**Playstyle & Strategy**

* Generalist disagrees with Playmaker around a wide vs tall playstyle. He doesn't think wide is more effective, just easier. If you want to just conquer as quickly as possible, Generalist sees that as really only a short-term strategy that isn't that great long-term. ""Playmaker and I look at this game a lot differently. Playmaker is just trying to grab the territory as quickly as possible and get out. He's like, I'm done with this run.""
* Generally less impressed with building-based countries and didn't particularly enjoy playing it when he gave them a look. They're very interesting and novel, but for the most part, you're going to be playing on land based countries.
* I don't think he's played army-based countries but the collapse when they lose their army is interesting apparently

**Game Feel & Accessibility**

* The learning curve may bounce new players
* The game takes itself more seriously than EU4 and is more grounded
* The amount of micro is very customizable
* Roleplay games are very viable and fun
* EU4 players might be turned off by how different everything is, especially the less ""arcade-y"" nature
* Generalist hasn't reached Age of Revolutions
* Most play hours happen in the first 100-200 years regardless, content distribution focuses more on early game because that's where most gameplay occurs

# Development Status & Release

**Current State**

* Generalist isn't sure when people will be able to show gameplay before release. Typically the review embargo ends a day before but the dev cycle for EU5 has been very different compared to other games so we'll see
* Many really big complaints are stuff that's not that hard to fix. When it comes to antagonism, which people have been saying isn't punishing enough, ""It's actually just a quick fix. You could actually just like triple the numbers and that'd probably be a fine adjustment""
* The game is in a ""very unfinished state"" according to Corbett, who was surprised how soon the release is, but Generalist disagrees. To him it's more of a balancing issue than core systems being broken
* A lot of changes that are gonna affect gameplay are relatively easy to implement since the systems are solid

**Missing Features**

* The lack of ""a really interesting and dynamic system for colonization"" is probably the biggest missing system if Generalist could complain about one absent feature
* If they released in current state, ""people would complain about some stuff, but it would probably be okay and people would enjoy it""
* Paradox can improve a decent amount with 10 weeks left, especially since most needed changes are polish-level rather than system-level
* There is a vehicle for content creators to directly give devs their feedback while playing",246,1756066643.0,EU5,33,1.0,False

The use of phones or digital communication devices is prohibited. 

Do not use your phone for calling, texting, navigation, music, or any purpose. In cases of emergency, contact dispatch via your handheld radio.

We recommend leaving your phone at home. If you choose to bring your device, power it off before entry onto Route 333. If you forget to power off your device, do NOT do so once en route; this would still qualify as phone-utilization. The offender would still be subject to punishment as the road deems fit.

Digital non-communication devices are permitted.

“What’s in the trailer?”

Through the radio, Randall sighed. In case anybody is unfamiliar with the mechanics of the handheld radio, you have to actually be pushing the transmit button for your voice to go through. Which meant Randall was being a passive aggressive cry-baby who intentionally decided for me to hear his sigh of annoyance. 

Sometimes, managers are just the worst.

I stood just outside my truck where I'd pulled over on the side of the highway to check my vehicle for damage. For those who don't remember from my last post, the things in the forest attacked me to try and get whatever was in the trailer. It was still dark outside.

“We literally just had this conversation,” he said. “Like three hours ago.”

“That was before I heard something inside the cargo. You tell me what’s in there right now, or I turn around and come back.”

“That eager to visit the forest again, huh?”

“Hang on,” I said. “How do you know about my encounter?” 

The other end of the radio fell silent.

“You set me up!” I said. “You knew they were going to go after me with this thing in the trunk. You were trying to kill me off!”

“Don’t be irrational. That’s not what happened. You―”

“Don’t lie to me!” I screamed―then immediately realized he couldn’t hear me, because, oh right, these are still radios. One at a time. Pushing my transmit button while he was pushing his was just preventing me from hearing him. Which made me even more angry and how dare the radio betray me too! Which only proved that yes. I indeed was being irrational, even if it was justified.

I calmed and lifted my finger.

“―safe as long as you followed the rules,” he continued, oblivious to my outburst. “You did follow the rules, right? What am I saying, you’re alive, so of course you did. Look, road dwellers just get more excited when there’s live cargo. That’s all. As long as you’re cautious the rest of the trip, you’ll be fine.”

“But you knew I could die.”

“We would never put you in real danger. I’m not worried for your safety, Brendon. You shouldn’t be either.”

I wasn’t, I realized. Sure, in the moment I felt fear just like anybody else, but afterwards, in the calm, I was never worried for my safety. It didn’t matter what happened to me. My fury was less about the prospect of dying and more about the injustice of being set up.

“Something’s crying in it,” I said. “It sounds like a little girl.”

“Well, it isn’t.”

“Then tell me what it is.”

“Stop asking. You know that isn’t something I'll do. You haven't slept yet Brendon. I haven’t either. Go put your head on a pillow, and let’s talk when we’re both more calm, yeah?”

I told him exactly where he could stick his head.

“You aren’t as valuable as you think,” he growled at me. “If you continue in such an unprofessional manner, we really will find a replacement.”

I suspected I was exactly as valuable as I thought I was. Who else would take this job? Who else could drive the highway as fast as me?

And unprofessional? That was rich coming from the guy who’d demanded I come in at one in the morning and shrugged off the suggestion that we help save the lives of his former employees. I was gearing up to explain all of this (you can bet in less-than-professional words) when a wave of fatigue hit me.

I really hadn't gotten any sleep. The sun would be up in a few hours, and my body was experiencing the adrenaline-exhausted version of a hangover.

“Fine,” I told Randall. “We argue when I wake.”

“You’ll feel better.”

He was right. After sleeping, I did feel better. And while that should have only annoyed me further, it was difficult to feel so since I now felt infuriatingly great.

So great, in fact, I didn’t radio Randall back. As much as I loathed him that morning, neither he nor anyone else at dispatch was ever going to answer my questions. That much was obvious even before he’d straight up admitted it. It was also obvious I wasn’t really going to go back until I’d unloaded my current haul, so what was the point?

Instead, I headed inside the truck stop to grab a cup of the only decent coffee on Route 333.

“You’re alright then,” Tiff told me in the mini-diner.

“Why wouldn’t I be?”

“The Faceless Man was prodding your rig for hours last night. I had a broom ready in case he tried to break anything. I’ve never seen him stay in one place like that.”

A chill crept through me. “I never saw him.”

“He wasn’t at the windows. He was at the back of the freight. Looked like he was trying to get inside.”

They get more excited when there’s live cargo. That’s what Randall had said.

I sipped at my coffee.

“Hey Tiff…” I started. How could I phrase this? “Have you ever figured out―have you ever wondered, um, what’s up with the other people on the road? The non-truckers, like the ones who work here? Like if they’re real or not?”

“Um. Like. I forget your generation uses so many filler words.” She considered my question. “There’s different types of real, I suppose. We’re one type. They’re another.”

A statement which, while sounding wise and sage, didn’t actually help me understand anything. Ah well.

Tiff packed me food for a few days, and I headed outside. Back at my rig, I slipped a pancake under the slit in the trailer door. Something snatched it from the inside.

“Can you hear me?” I whispered.

No response.

“Do you need help?”

Nothing except the near-imperceptible shudder of the back door. Almost as if something on the other side was pressing a hand to it. Waiting to see what I’d decide.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



It was after about six hours of driving that I realized with dawning, crippling horror of my irreversible mistake.

I’d forgotten a battery pack.

Let me explain. As you all probably remember, it’s prohibited to use phones on Route 333, even if you’re not calling with them. Why exactly? Dunno. But it is, and I wasn’t about to break any rules unnecessarily. Instead, I’d gotten in the habit of downloading content onto my old iPod Nano, which apparently qualified as a different category (I checked with management. It’s fine as long as I leave it in airplane mode). I also brought a battery pack to recharge the iPod with, since the outlets in the trucks didn’t always work.

Such as my current truck.

Which meant―you guessed it―I was now stuck on a ten day drive without any podcasts, books, or self-chosen music. And while I did understand on a deeply personal level that there were indeed worse tragedies than ‘lack of entertainment,’ this did still qualify as a tragedy.

I’d stayed away from the radio before that point. A few of the stations were in fact dangerous―they’d put you in a trance or whisper secrets you wished you could unhear―but overall they were safe. The other truckers didn’t seem to fear them too much. Logically, I knew the radio was overall safe, but I’d still never been desperate enough to take the risk. 

Until my iPod died, that is.

I flipped past a few country stations. Not my thing. Soon, though, I discovered something odd: a K-pop channel. 

It had probably been a few years since I’d actually listened to a car radio, but I couldn’t ever remember Korean music playing on it. Especially not out in the middle of nowhere like this. And the song that was playing―I didn’t recognize it. 

I know K-pop. Stereotype me however you wish, but yes, I’m one of those white guys that watches anime, and watches K-dramas, and listens to Korean boy bands. K-pop Demon Hunter? Pretty good. This song though? Not a clue.

I listened for a while more. The channel was 96.2. That wasn’t one of the stations I’d been warned against, was it? None of the music that came on was stuff I’d heard. They sounded like the groups I listened to but songs I was positive didn’t exist. Eventually, some of them started repeating, not in a loop like a playlist, just in the way popular songs replay every hour on the radio. 

And you know what? I started getting into it.

Besides the pay, the perks of Route 333 had been few and far between, but this was one I could get used to. An entire playlist of music I loved that didn’t exist in the real world? Sign me up. Maybe next time I’d bring a tape recorder and post this stuff online. I even started singing along. Time flew by.

I didn’t notice the flashing blue and white lights until the sirens came on.

“Um Randall...”

Nobody responded.

The police car pulled in behind me. The lights flicked off.

“Randall,” I tried again.

“Sorry!” came a voice from the handheld radio. A woman. Gloria, I believed? I didn’t interact with her as much. “I was out of the room. Randall’s not actually―oh, he left a note. It says ‘Tell Brendon I’m off shift. If he wants to continue arguing, tell him one of the following responses’.” She pauses. “The rest is quite rude to be honest.”

“I’m not trying to argue,” I said. “I just got pulled over.”

“Do you have a flat?”

“No. As in a cop pulled me over.”

There was silence. The silence of a doctor deciding how to word that ‘it’s terminal. There’s nothing I can do.’ “How bad were you speeding?” Gloria asked. “That can make a big difference.”

“Not at all. I was on cruise. I’ve read that section in the employee handbook.”

“Wait, you haven’t read all the employee handbook yet?”

Um. “Look, the important thing is he pulled me over. What do I do?”

A car door slammed. The highway patrol officer approached.

“The reason makes a difference,” Gloria pushed. 

“Yeah, I get that, but I don’t know.” I paused. “My cargo. That’s got to be why. I’m the one on the long haul trip with the special cargo.”

A longer silence. “Let me call Randall.”

The radio went dead. A knock sounded on my door. My heartbeat pittered in my chest. The employee handbook was pretty clear about this particular subject: don’t get pulled over. Don’t speed or do anything that might draw the highway patrol, because there wasn’t much you could do once you had. 

I didn’t do anything, I assured myself. This isn’t my fault. Not really.

Then again, it wasn’t really Tiff’s fault she’d gotten lane-locked. 

“Sir,” a husky voice said from outside.

I held my breath, and popped the door.

He had a tag and a uniform. He rested a hand on his hip. The mustached man was just like every other officer that had ever pulled me over, save one singular difference: his head was bent entirely back.

It was as if somebody with impossible strength had grabbed his hair and yanked backwards and down. The neck was snapped and contorted. An empty tube jutted up from a break in the twisted skin, his throat. His entire face was upside down and he stood backwards to face me. 

“Um, hi,” I said.

“Do you mind telling me what’s in your trailer?”

“Funny story. Not actually sure.”

“Please remove yourself from the vehicle and open the back of the truck.”

“Sorry, why did you pull me over?”

The officer sighed as if to say kids these days. A puff of red mist spurted from his severed throat blowhole. “Sir, you are speaking to an officer of the law. I will be investigating your vehicle. You will extricate yourself this instant or face the full wrath of the law.” It was like a child pretending at the lines a real police might say.

That thought calmed me. Play-acting. Fine. Two could dance to this tune.

“Your warrant?” I asked. “As an officer of the law, you’re clearly well aware you need one to search private property.”

“Yes. That… that’s correct. I do know that. I’ll retrieve mine now.”

He walked backwards towards his stalling car― by which I mean he walked forwards, with his upside down eyes blinking at me.

“Hello!” I called into my handheld. “Could really use some advice right now?”

Nothing.

“If not, I’m planning to try and outrun him.”

“Brendon, do not try to out-drive highway patrol. I repeat, do NOT attempt a chase. You will lose.” Gloria’s voice came through strong and clear. Finally.

Before I could respond, she continued. “I spoke to Randall. He said―none of us love the idea―but he said if you really weren’t speeding, there is one thing you could try?”

“Yeah?” I said.

She sounded almost embarrassed as she explained. Randall had suggested a last ditch attempt at escape, something that had only worked a few times before: annoying the officer until he left. If I really had done nothing to get pulled over, the officer might give up if he got frustrated enough. As long as he had no legal grounds to detain me or worse―ticket me.

I didn’t bother asking what ticketing actually meant.

“Okay, and how am I supposed to annoy the officer?” In my side window, I could see the cop ruffling around in the passenger of his cruiser.

“Randall says―again we don’t like this, but it’s worked once before―you can try videotaping him with your phone. Cops hate that.”

The fear pulsing through me abated. The pounding distress settled. A cold understanding took over. “Hey Gloria,” I said. “Put Randall through to me.”

I imagined a disagreement. A small debate. Eventually, though, his voice came through muffled and tinny. She must be holding her phone to the handheld. “Brendon?” he said.

“Answer honestly this time. Did you know this haul might kill me?” 

“I did.”

“Is there a chance I survive if I use my phone?”

“As soon as the cop is gone, drive like there’s no tomorrow.”

“That wasn’t my question,” I said. “I asked if there’s a chance I survive.”

“There is.”

“And if I refuse this plan?” I asked.

“Don’t.” His voice was barely audible. “I’m sorry. I really am sorry we put you in this position, but you cannot let highway patrol get ahold of your cargo. None of the sentient road-dwellers can. That isn’t an option. Too much is at stake. This is bigger than you.”

I nodded. “If I risk breaking this rule, I have one condition. It isn't negotiable. It’s a yes or no. I will only do this if you agree, got that? It's that when I get back, you will explain to me what Route 333 is. You will tell me what I’m hauling and why it’s so important.” I took a breath without letting go of the transmit button. “No arguing. Yes or no?”

A pause.

“Yes.”

There was a knock on the door. The officer was back. I set the radio down, then carefully, resigned, pulled my phone from the passenger cubby and powered it on.

I could explain in detail what happened next. It would be the natural thing to do, to describe how I recorded our conversation like a pestilential YouTuber until the bent-necked officer exploded and stormed away―I won’t do that. 

To me the whole thing was a dream. It worked. Of course it did. Randall knew it would more than he could let on, but none of that mattered. I may have survived highway patrol.

...But I wouldn’t survive this next part.

I watched as the black and white cruiser pulled in front of me and screamed down the highway. Smaller, smaller, gone. How does the officer see out his windshield?, I wondered distantly. I set my phone in the drink holder without bothering to power it off. What I did no longer mattered. 

I waited.

Waited.

Waited

A line of clouds appeared over the horizon line, dark and hostile. They rolled in at an unnatural speed. Outside my windows, the wind picked up. Dust devils rose up across the desert.

My end was here.

Randall never would have agreed to my one condition if he thought I’d survive.  I knew almost nothing about him, but I knew that much. That was the only reason I’d made our deal: to see his response. Never, for any reason, would he or the rest of management tell me the truth about the road.

He needed me to avoid highway patrol. He couldn’t allow any of the living things on Route 333 to get to my cargo, but whatever was coming for me now was in some sort of a different category. It wasn’t alive. It was deadly though. Enough he knew he wouldn't have to uphold his end of our bargain.

I inhaled.

I exhaled.

Clouds rushed in above me, and thick drops of rust-colored liquid slid down my windshield. Blood. The end.

Even now, I [wasn’t nervous](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1lklmnq/welcome/).

“What’s in the trailer?”

Through the radio, Randall sighed. In case anybody is unfamiliar with the mechanics of the handheld radio, you have to actually be pushing the transmit button for your voice to go through. Which meant Randall was being a passive aggressive cry-baby who intentionally *decided* for me to hear his sigh of annoyance. 

Sometimes, managers are just the worst.

I stood just outside my truck where I'd pulled over on the side of the highway to check my vehicle for damage. For those who don't remember from my last post, the things in the forest attacked me to try and get whatever was in the trailer. It was still dark outside.

“Okay, and how am I supposed to *annoy* the officer?” In my side window, I could see the cop ruffling around in the passenger of his cruiser.

“Randall says―again we don’t like this, but it’s worked once before―you can try videotaping him with your phone. Cops hate that.”

The fear pulsing through me abated. The pounding distress settled. A cold understanding took over. “Hey Gloria,” I said. “Put Randall through to me.”

I imagined a disagreement. A small debate. Eventually, though, his voice came through muffled and tinny. She must be holding her phone to the handheld. “Brendon?” he said.

“Answer honestly this time. Did you know this haul might kill me?” 

“I did.”

“Is there a chance I survive if I use my phone?”

“As soon as the cop is gone, drive like there’s no tomorrow.”

“That wasn’t my question,” I said. “I asked if there’s a chance I survive.”

“There is.”

“And if I refuse this plan?” I asked.

“Don’t.” His voice was barely audible. “I’m sorry. I really am sorry we put you in this position, but you cannot let highway patrol get ahold of your cargo. None of the sentient road-dwellers can. That isn’t an option. Too much is at stake. This is bigger than you.”

I nodded. “If I risk breaking this rule, I have one condition. It isn't negotiable. It’s a yes or no. I will only do this if you agree, got that? It's that when I get back, you will explain to me what Route 333 is. You will tell me what I’m hauling and why it’s so important.” I took a breath without letting go of the transmit button. “No arguing. Yes or no?”

A pause.

“Yes.”

There was a knock on the door. The officer was back. I set the radio down, then carefully, resigned, pulled my phone from the passenger cubby and powered it on.

I could explain in detail what happened next. It would be the natural thing to do, to describe how I recorded our conversation like a pestilential YouTuber until the bent-necked officer exploded and stormed away―I won’t do that. 

To me the whole thing was a dream. It worked. Of course it did. Randall *knew* it would more than he could let on, but none of that mattered. I may have survived highway patrol.

...But I wouldn’t survive this next part.

I watched as the black and white cruiser pulled in front of me and screamed down the highway. Smaller, smaller, *gone*. *How does the officer see out his windshield?,* I wondered distantly. I set my phone in the drink holder without bothering to power it off. What I did no longer mattered. 

I waited.

Waited.

Waited

A line of clouds appeared over the horizon line, dark and hostile. They rolled in at an unnatural speed. Outside my windows, the wind picked up. Dust devils rose up across the desert.

My end was here.

Randall never would have agreed to my one condition if he thought I’d survive.  I knew almost nothing about him, but I knew that much. That was the only reason I’d made our deal: to see his response. Never, for any reason, would he or the rest of management tell me the truth about the road.

He needed me to avoid highway patrol. He couldn’t allow any of the living things on Route 333 to get to my cargo, but whatever was coming for me now was in some sort of a different category. It wasn’t alive. It *was* deadly though. Enough he knew he wouldn't have to uphold his end of our bargain.

I inhaled.

I exhaled.

Clouds rushed in above me, and thick drops of rust-colored liquid slid down my windshield. Blood. The end.

Even now, I [wasn’t nervous](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1lklmnq/welcome/).

1mz64y1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1mz64y1/worth_trying_another_elimination_diet/,Worth trying another elimination diet?,"I'm 7 months pregnant and in absolute agony and desperately searching for anything to dial down my constant urinary urgency. I’m limited in what I can do rn so once again considering diet.

History is that in 2020, I did *months* of an elimination diet, eating nothing but brown rice, eggs, and blueberries. It left me underweight and anaemic, but had zero effect on my bladder symptoms. Now I'm wondering if I tried it long enough. I know I held to just those 3 things for at least 2.5 months, but at that point, I started to slip a bit and occasionally had dairy and sugar. How soon should you see effects when going completely barebones with your diet? Were those even the right three things?

I did avoid coffee and all fruits except for blueberries and pears for 18 months, tomatoes and spicy foods for years, rarely drank alcohol- none of it seemed to help and I didn't notice flares after I slipped up. In fact, when I did recover, I'd been drinking coffee daily for a year and when I was in remission, I never flared from diet. Still, I'm desperate. Like unable to work, struggling to care for my 2yo, can barely leave the house.

I already don’t consume alcohol (obviously), soda, juice, citrus fruits, tea, chocolate, soy, artificial sweeteners, and meat. Would primarily be cutting out coffee, tomatoes, spicy things, all of which I only have occasionally anyway at this point; most fruits, onions, vinegar. Is that enough? Obviously don't want to go down to three things again, as I'm pregnant and will be breastfeeding. Do you need to be *that* brutal? 

We're fairly certain my case is PFD-driven, specifically caused by a really dysfunctional right hip (which will be replaced in the spring). I have lots of weird symptoms like urgency that's worse when I move my right leg and one-sided neropathic vulva pain in one tiny spot that flares with movement. No nocturia and worse after voiding. In fact, I'm completely fine once asleep and in the morning--sometimes just until I start moving and sometimes until I've peed 2-3 times or walked anywhere. No frequency and normal voids, at least when not pregnant. Intractable pelvic floor spasm, muscular glute and perineal pain, all on one side. Symptoms have worsened during this pregnancy.

BUT I know that muscular and fascial compression of the bladder can secondarily cause bladder inflammation, which is why I’m considering diet again. Don't expect it to cure me but I need some symptom relief urgently.

**Anything else I could try while pregnant? I need some hope because I'm very debilitated and losing my mind.**

Things I've already tried that have not helped urinary urgency: amitriptyline and gabapentin (do completely cover up my neuropathic vulva pain, so been on them for years), antihistamines (H1/H2 blockers), lactoferrin, antibiotics including tetracyclines, probiotics, Azo, alkaline water, Prelief.

Currently taking: magnesium, iron, pregnancy-specific Omega 3, vitamin D. Still in PT, for both pelvic floor and hip, but it hasn’t helped in 18 months, when I came out of remission.

Ruled out: endo, MCAS, UTI.
