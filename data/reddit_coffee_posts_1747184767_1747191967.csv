I‚Äôm Alicia. 43 (44 in a few days), curvy, confident when I want to be, soft when I choose to be, and grounded in realness always. I‚Äôm from PA and hoping to connect with someone who doesn‚Äôt mind taking things slow, step by step, vibe by vibe.

I work remotely in HR as a Program Manager and juggle a beautifully chaotic life as a mom of four, two of whom are autistic and one with Type 1 diabetes. Life‚Äôs heavy sometimes, but I hold it down with grace, grit, and a strong cup of black coffee. I‚Äôm a survivor, a singer, a spiritualist, and a lover of 80s culture, astrology, movies, and all music.

I‚Äôm not here to jump into anything heavy fast. I want slow-burn energy. Let‚Äôs start by talking, vibing, exchanging stories, memes, music‚Ä¶ and yes, I‚Äôd also like to exchange pics early on so I know who I‚Äôm actually connecting with. I‚Äôm all about keeping things honest and open.

I‚Äôm looking for someone grounded, emotionally intelligent, and funny (like, real-life side-eye, ‚Äúyou really just said that?‚Äù kind of funny). I want someone to talk to, day or night. Let‚Äôs start with that, the talking. The late-night confessions, random memes, and deep ‚Äúwhat are we even doing here‚Äù convos. I‚Äôm not rushing. I want to build a connection that doesn‚Äôt need force to feel real.

Bonus points if you‚Äôre open-minded, patient, and can match wit for wit. I love banter that makes me smirk mid-scroll.

Let‚Äôs see where it goes. Not here for games. Not here for pressure. Just real vibes only.

We had tricks. Take TTC downtown in the winter. Coatcheck our jackets while we walked through the housewares section, daydreaming of our future together.

We bought our Christmas tree there. We did our wedding register there. We bought all my suits there.

But the best: back in 2015 on one of our random walks through the flagship store, my now wife saw a small baby Hudson's Bay sweater. She thought it was just the cutest. I remember going back downtown the next day after class to pick it up. I held onto it in secret for seven years until we got pregnant.

Free 2oz bags will go to the other top 5 guesses.,"This is a fun bean that has some character.  My intuition after roasting 4k+ batches of coffee over the past 10+ years is starting to grow a spidey-sense for knowing bean origin & roast date just by looking beans. So I wanted to see if there are others out there with these same abilities by doing a little reddit contest to find out.  I'm not a perfect guesser but am starting to get a feel for beans by the look, shape, etc.

I want to give everyone a chance to guess what these beans are, so I'm giving 2 weeks time.  I'll pay to mail the prize bags out myself to the top 6 closest guesses, and will contact folks via dm after May 28 to coordinate give aways. And I'll congratulate the winners on here by username.  

I'm not here to advertise my coffee co, nor to give hints so I'm not saying anything else and don't plan to talk about my roastery or other coffee offerings or anything after May 28th, don't worry.  But I will reveal the answers so everyone gets to know what this coffee is exactly and see if their guess was close.

I'm just really curious if anyone else out there can judge beans just by the looks of them.  Only first guesses count.  I'll try to take all factors into consideration.  Country of origin/region/city location of farm will be highest value, followed by roast date and then farm process method.  I'll just try to triangulate using that basis as best I can.

1. The beauty everywhere, mountains, lakes, rivers, many wonderful species of wildlife, endless breathtaking views everywhere.

2. The wine and cider ofcourse (Currently drinking some BC cider rn.) Can't leave that out.

3. The wonderful dog parks/beaches, trails and such. My dog absolutely loves it here. It would be abuse to ever take her away from here. 

4. The human beaches are great as well

5. While a lot of work to be done, it seems a lot of people here care about the environment here and want to see this place stay beautiful and I am all for that.

6. The happiness, people out here for the most part seem very happy, especially when that suns out. I find I connect with people so much easier here, and am meeting more friends than I ever have, but that may be due to happiness I now feel as this place has brought me to a better place.

7. I love the vast access to locally owned and operated markets/stores/shops.

8. The hiking here is amazing coming from the praries. Hiking up hill/up mountains is an adjustment but I love it and it is very rewarding and going back to the beauty part, It makes it that much more nice.

9. I'm impressed with the great food out here such as Arby's. 

10. Last but not least, the magpies. More specifically, the family of magpies I have been supporting. They bring me so much joy during my morning coffee and my afternoon cider. The intelligence and emotions these corvids have is amazing. Genuinely feel like they are present and know what's going on, and share a mutual respect with me.

1km4sm8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1km4sm8,ETS Recap,"My friends Walter and David joined me recently for the East Texas Showdown, a bikepacking event created and hosted by Patrick Farnsworth of the Bikes or Death Podcast. The event, now in its fifth year, actually has three different routes: the Showdown at 400 miles, the Slowdown at 280 miles, and the Lowdown at 165 miles. I have been looking to take on the 400-mile Showdown since its inception, and 2025 was the year to make it happen. 
While the Showdown is technically a race, we entered with the intention of racing nothing. I planned to do what Patrick calls Pro Slow. At some point, I started referring to it as the Showdown at a Slowdown pace. The goal was to go out, do what I love, and enjoy an epic adventure. Meeting new people along the way and experiencing what the course had to offer, like the millions of fragrant wildflowers, adds to the experience even more. As for the epic factor, the 400 miles of the Showdown surely qualified.
This event was different from others for me. Normally I am in great shape with well over a thousand miles in the couple of months leading up to it. This time around I was well below 700 miles for the year, 146 of them coming the weekend before. This was not of my own volition. Several circumstances, including a car wreck the year before, had kept me from really riding as much as I liked. Nonetheless, this was not going to stop me. After all, I was there to enjoy the adventure, unencumbered by the pressures of competition. 
The event started out in an epic fashion. After eight miles of road in a neutral start, the gravel and dirt roads started. Rain the night before and that morning had made the course quite sloppy. While I expected the going to be slow, the course conditions made it even slower. The mud and soft sand were no friend to any of us that day. My determination to complete the event stayed high, and I pushed forward with my friends. After the first section of muddy roads, we were greeted by some very beautiful pavement. The miles, of course, before then gave me a new appreciation for the hard, unwavering nature of asphalt. To make things even better, just a little ways down that road was a large spigot that was spraying out. The local water company's task of purging a line was a prime opportunity that was seized by many to knock much of the mud from the drivetrains of our bikes. 
As the day went on, conditions generally improved despite an additional rainstorm that lasted about 10 minutes. As we ticked off the miles, I ran into Todd, a fellow Bikepacking Roots Community Steward. After making his acquaintance and making a stop to resupply our water, we kept moving. We came across several puddles the size of the road. They had hard bottoms, which made things easy, but apprehension creeps in when you can see the bottom or know how deep they are. A long and slow 55 miles later, we found lunch at a Brookshire Brothers Express. Here a Subway sandwich, some chips, and two Gatorlytes were on the menu for me. The employees were awesome and even had a water hose ready for us to clean our bikes. It was nice to get the bulk of the mud from the bike, which easily removed several pounds from my already heavy steed. 
After a short break, we moseyed on out to skies that were not looking too friendly again. We pushed a decent pace in an effort to avoid more sloppy dirt roads. Unfortunately, it did not take very long, and we were in a heavy downpour that lasted about 10 minutes. The now sticky and muddy dirt roads slowed our pace. Making matters worse was my preparation leading up to the event. My legs were not very happy, and I started to feel weak. Doubt crept into my mind about what I was going to be able to accomplish. It had become a struggle, and I felt bad for holding up Walter and David. 
Eventually we came upon a convenience store where I would get more fluids and some pizza. As soon as I was full, I got back on the bike and headed out. I did not want to slow Walter and David any more than I already had. Temporarily solo on the adventure, I entered the Davy Crockett National Forest. Talk about a beautiful setting. Eventually Walter and David caught up to me, and we discussed where we would spend the night. The original plan was to make it to mile marker 140, the city of Jacksonville, TX. It was clear that was not going to happen any more, so the new plan was to stop at Mission Tejas State Park, which would require us to go off course less than a half mile. 
The going was good, then we realized that we had passed the turnoff to the park by a couple of miles. Not wanting to turn back, we pushed on into the night without a clue of where we would end up. Around mile marker 118, we happened upon a church. This was the perfect spot to stop, camp, and refuel. Unfortunately, we did not get very close to our original plan of mile 140, but 118 was much better than plan B of 91.
Day two started pretty early, and after just six miles, we found ourselves at a small cafe in the middle of nowhere. The people were welcoming, the breakfast was good, and the coffee was free. It was just what we needed to get the day started. Getting back on the road, we found a mix of gravel and mud before a long stretch of pavement into Jacksonville, TX. Here we found lunch at a Whataburger, and after eating and preparing for more miles, we pushed forward with smiles on our faces. 
Once we made our way to the outskirts of the city, we came upon numerous dogs that wanted to be a nuisance on our adventure. One of these dogs, a large yellow lab, ran out after Walter and right in front of me. It was a close call, but no dog or human was harmed. Further down the same road, a couple was sitting out at the road cheering us on. They even knew our names, making for a fun exchange. They even warned us about some small dogs a little down the road. Sure enough, a pack of vicious chihuahuas came out and chased us for about 30 feet before retreating back to their yard.
The riding continued on with the miles going by slowly. Dinner was found at another small restaurant that had some great fried fish. We also ran into Todd again; somehow we kept leapfrogging each other without seeing when it happened. An enjoyable conversation over dinner ensued before we put in another 25 miles to camp at Soloman Lake Park. Here we were welcomed to showers and an indoor space to camp inside their Crazy Horse Saloon. They even had snacks and water for us to partake in. Once I set up my sleeping pad, pillow, and quilt, I slept well on the floor next to my bike. 
The next morning was again an early one. For Day three, we planned to make the start/finish line at the Bullet Grill for the night, mile marker 327. Doing so would mean just 66 miles to go the next day. My poor preparation leading up to the event was really showing again. I was sore in places that aren't fun, and then I struggled to keep up with Walter and David at times. Breakfast for me was oatmeal that I had packed, and I placed a couple of candy bars in my feed bag for down the road. We all prepped our bikes and ate before quickly making our way out of the saloon and down the road. 
We made it to Trinity, TX, around lunchtime. There we would find a Brookshire Brothers supermarket. I refilled my supplies and had another candy bar, this time a Twix. A Gatorlyte and a couple of cold oranges were consumed here also. I never thought cold oranges could be so good. Thanks to the supermarket, we were well supplied for the remainder of the day. We made our way along the course, enjoying the views and flowers, escaping the occasional loose dog, and having a good time. I expected to make it back to the Bullet Grill after dark but was happy to do it with the tiniest sliver of light left. We set up camp and went to the grill to get some food. However, there was one problem: the kitchen closed early on Sundays. Lucky for us, though, there were some snacks available, and we were gifted some sandwiches to fill our stomachs. After that, we were off to bed with anticipation of the final day.
Day four arrived after a warm night in my tent. I did shed a couple of items, most notably my tent that I left set up, but I could not bring myself to shed everything. After all, I was bikepacking, and what would I be doing with nothing on the bike? Walter and David agreed I just wanted to punish myself with the extra weight on the bike. There were 66 miles of the Death Star Loop, and we were complete. This turned out to be some of the most beautiful riding of it all. The Sam Houston National Forest was the primary setting. It is no secret that I love the forest, as I love the trees, the views, and the sounds of the forest. This place made me happy. The roads were pretty good as the rain expected overnight stayed away. We pushed on, taking a couple of breaks to snack but otherwise keeping a rather steady pace. Just before 2 pm, we returned to the Bullet Grill, officially completing the East Texas Showdown. After packing up and changing clothes, plus some much-needed deodorant, we sat down at the Bullet Grill for a well-earned meal. The adventure did not disappoint. Thank you to Patrick and all the volunteers who helped make this possible. We have even talked about doing it again next year. ",2,1747191150.0,bikepacking,1,1.0,False

2. (with 2 previous managers knowing and not saying anything) literally contacted our dm about two partners who had other jobs at coffee shops who depended on it for their income and got them to decide which job to work at within a week

3. Made a shift lead have an ultimatum: transfer out, open her availability, or quit because this shift worked at another job in the morning

4.  Somebody at our store has a learning disability (which had been fine for our previous managers) and now she wants her to find accommodation through starbucks or transfer out to a lower volume store. Mentioning ‚ÄúWhere was this disability 4 years ago?‚Äù

While I have my own biological family, the connection isn't as fulfilling as I'd hoped, and I find myself longing for a different kind of kinship ‚Äì a family built on shared values, genuine connection, and mutual support.

I'm in my early 40s, living in the Rochester, NY area, and I'm looking to connect with others who might feel similarly. Maybe you've also experienced distance from your biological family or you've always dreamed of expanding your circle with people who truly get you.

What I'm envisioning is creating a chosen family ‚Äì a network of individuals who can offer emotional support, share life's joys and challenges, and build meaningful traditions together. Think get-togethers, game nights, helping each other out with projects, camping trips, or simply being there to listen when someone needs an ear.

I'm open to connecting with people of all ages, backgrounds, and walks of life. What's important to me is finding individuals who are:

* **Kind and compassionate:** Empathy and understanding are essential.
* **Open and honest:** I value genuine communication.
* **Reliable and supportive:** Someone who will be there, and who I can be there for.
* **Respectful of boundaries:** Understanding and respecting each other's needs is crucial.
* **Looking for genuine connection:** This isn't about casual acquaintances, but building something deeper.
* LGBTQ+ friendly and accepting of differences.

I'm not entirely sure what this will look like in practice, and I'm open to ideas and suggestions. Maybe we start with a casual meet-up for coffee or a low-key activity. The important thing is to start building those connections.

If this resonates with you, and you're also in the Rochester, NY area and looking to cultivate a stronger sense of chosen family, please feel free to send me a chat and tell me a little about yourself and what you're looking for.

This might be a long shot, but I truly believe that meaningful connections are out there, and sometimes you have to take a leap of faith to find them.

Ill get motivated and stay consistent even when im not motivated to start cleansing, the morning cleanse in specific, sometimes incorporating HMD smoothie, ill do so good for a week or so and bam, I skip one day because I forget to stock up on celery the day prior, or i dont sleep well and have the craving for treat myself to an iced coffee the next morning, and it turns into days, weeks. 
I need some advice.. maybe im just too weak..  
What made you say ""enough is enough"", or what helped you to stay consistent even when you didnt feel like it, AT ALL...thanks. in advance.",3,1747190935.0,medicalmedium,0,1.0,False

I love this band so much. Nothing better. 

Stoked for this weekend. Selling these flags - msg me if you wanna buy, I‚Äôll be downtown all weekend as well as around credit one pre show selling these bad boys - 25 a piece and boy are they nice flags (bigger than usual flags (6x4), double sided and sturdy as material) 

Here‚Äôs my recommendations for bars, food, and such for anyone coming from out of town - downtown can be repetitive, here‚Äôs some off the beaten path spots from someone who just graduated. Hope this helps. 

Food Casual:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Big Gun Burger - great burgs, cheap drinks and a pool table
‚Ä¢	‚Å†60 Bull Cafe - awesome breakfast and lunch
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Marina Variety Store - just go and see for yourself (my favorite breakfast spot)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Moes Crosstown Tavern - best wings in town
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Bay St Biergarten - solid food, lots of TVs and a great huge draft selection
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Lewis BBQ - better than Home team and on the same street
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Circes Grotto or Legend Deli - fucking awesome sammys and both on CofC campus so check that out
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Cafecito - great coffee
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Queen ST Grocery -
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Torres Suprettes - damn good burrito
‚Ä¢	‚Å†East Side Soulfood - ill personally be sucking this down pre show on Sat

Plenty more... these are just my favorites.

Food Upscale:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Grill 225 or Oak Steakhouse - traditional steakhouses that do it right (Hall's Blows)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Leons - walk ins only so expect a wait but worth the chicken, fish and oysters. They do it well here.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Darling Oyster Bar - best oysters in town and great happy hour (4-6)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Malagon - fucking gasssss and great for small groups
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Southbound - super damn nice, however a great song and name for a place, food is top tier. (Will the boys ever cover this song?)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Indaco - italian that does the job
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Little Jacks - upscale burgers, somehow the chicken milanese is the best thing on the menu.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Maam Saab - really really good Pakitsani food, tried this on a whim and can't wait to go back. Cocktails are some of the best ive had too.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Church and Union - overhyped but always good

On Peninsula, there isn't much middle ground for food. Either super nice... or a cheap dive. Just walk around and find something!

So stoked the boys are back in town again.

See all you good people there.

They came in and showed me a few things. My computer applications weren‚Äôt all running. I was given a task by the head of the firm before I started training. Because my computer didn‚Äôt work all the way the boss‚Äôs son who is an attorney took over and completed the work then sealed it and handed me everything and sent me to drop it off. Later I was telling the trainer what I worked on and she checked it to find that the address of the client wasn‚Äôt included in the document. She knew i didn‚Äôt prepare it and told me not to worry.

But how do they truly compare? Instant coffee may not have the same depth of flavor or aroma as freshly brewed coffee. Its quick preparation appeals to busy schedules and those who need a fast caffeine fix. Real coffee, on the other hand, brings a ritual of preparation and a variety of tastes.

Many coffee lovers appreciate the complexity and freshness found in ground beans. Yet, instant coffee has evolved, with some brands offering improved taste profiles. Understanding the differences helps you choose what fits your lifestyle and taste.¬†[So, let‚Äôs dive into this comparison to explore which coffee option might be best for you.](https://gomehedi.com/top-10-best-instant-coffee-in-the-world/)

# Taste Comparison

Is instant coffee as delightful as a freshly brewed cup? Many coffee lovers ponder this question. The debate isn‚Äôt just about convenience versus tradition; it‚Äôs about taste. Coffee enthusiasts often argue that the flavor is the heart of the experience. Let‚Äôs dive into the taste comparison between instant coffee and real coffee. Explore how these two varieties differ in flavor profiles and aroma.

# Flavor Profiles

Instant coffee and real coffee present distinct flavor profiles. Each offers unique experiences. Here‚Äôs a closer look:

* **Instant Coffee:**¬†Often, it‚Äôs milder with a smooth finish. Some say it lacks depth. The process removes some oils and compounds that create rich flavors.
* **Real Coffee:**¬†Offers a broader range of flavors. You might taste notes of chocolate, fruit, or nuts. The brewing process helps preserve the oils and compounds.

Flavor also varies by type:

|Type|Instant Coffee|Real Coffee|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Bold|Less intense|Rich and strong|
|Mild|Gentle and smooth|Balanced and nuanced|

Both types can satisfy different taste preferences. Some prefer instant for its simplicity. Others enjoy the complexity of real coffee.

# Aroma Differences

Aroma plays a significant role in coffee enjoyment. It can enhance or diminish the overall experience.

**Instant Coffee:**¬†The aroma is often lighter. The manufacturing process affects the scent. It might not be as enticing or fresh.

**Real Coffee:**¬†Known for its robust aroma. Freshly ground beans release a rich, inviting scent. It can fill a room and awaken the senses.

Aroma differences can be summarized:

1. **Complexity:**¬†Real coffee often has a layered scent. Instant coffee may smell flat.
2. **Intensity:**¬†Freshly brewed coffee tends to be more aromatic. Instant coffee might lack this depth.

Choosing between instant and real coffee can hinge on aroma preference. For some, the smell is as vital as the taste.

# Nutritional Value

Instant coffee and real coffee both have their unique appeal. While instant coffee is quick and convenient, real coffee often boasts a richer taste. But how do they compare in terms of nutritional value? Understanding the nutritional aspects can help you make an informed choice. Let‚Äôs delve into the caffeine content and antioxidant levels of both types of coffee.

# Caffeine Content

One of the main reasons people drink coffee is for its caffeine. Caffeine gives you that boost of energy. But how does instant coffee stack up against real coffee in this regard?

Instant coffee typically contains less caffeine than brewed coffee. Here‚Äôs a closer look:

|Type of Coffee|Caffeine Content (per 8 oz cup)|
|:-|:-|
|Instant Coffee|60-80 mg|
|Brewed Coffee|95-165 mg|

* Instant coffee has less caffeine, which may be better for those sensitive to caffeine.
* Brewed coffee offers a stronger caffeine boost, ideal for those needing more energy.

**Instant coffee**¬†is a lighter option for caffeine intake. While¬†**real coffee**¬†offers more punch, it might not be suitable for everyone. Consider your caffeine needs when choosing.

# Antioxidant Levels

Antioxidants are vital for your health. They protect your body from damage by free radicals. Coffee is a significant source of antioxidants for many people. But how does instant coffee compare to real coffee?

Both instant and real coffee contain antioxidants. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

* **Chlorogenic acids**: Both types have these, which help in reducing inflammation and regulating blood sugar.
* **Polyphenols**: These compounds are present in both, aiding in heart health and reducing the risk of certain diseases.

Surprisingly,¬†**instant coffee**¬†can have slightly higher antioxidant levels. This is due to the way it‚Äôs processed. The concentration of solids in instant coffee may contribute to this.

1. Both types offer health benefits from antioxidants.
2. Instant coffee can be a convenient source of antioxidants.
3. Real coffee provides a more complex flavor with its antioxidants.

Choosing between instant and real coffee depends on what you value more‚Äîconvenience or flavor. Both options contribute positively to your antioxidant intake.

# Preparation Methods

Preparing coffee can be a simple delight or a meticulous ritual. Instant coffee offers convenience, while real coffee provides a richer experience. Understanding the preparation methods can help you decide which suits your lifestyle and taste buds. Both have unique processes and flavors, catering to diverse preferences. Let‚Äôs explore how each type is made and what makes them distinct.

# Brewing Instant Coffee

Instant coffee is known for its¬†**quick and easy preparation**. It‚Äôs perfect for busy mornings or when you‚Äôre on the go. The process involves dissolving dried coffee granules in hot water. This method is straightforward and doesn‚Äôt require special equipment.

* **Boil water**: Use a kettle or microwave.
* **Measure coffee**: Usually one to two teaspoons per cup.
* **Add water**: Pour hot water over the granules.
* **Stir**: Mix until fully dissolved.

Instant coffee is convenient but lacks the complexity of real coffee. It often contains added flavors or sweeteners. Despite being quick, it delivers a¬†**simpler taste**¬†profile.

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Fast preparation|Less flavor depth|
|No equipment needed|May contain additives|

This option suits those who prioritize speed and simplicity over richness and aroma.

# Making Real Coffee

Real coffee involves a more¬†**involved brewing process**. It allows for customization and experimentation with flavors. Common methods include using a drip coffee maker, French press, or espresso machine.

1. Make sure to get cash. Although many places will accept credit cards, local spots tend to only take cash, with a preference for BZD. Many also accept USD.

2. Highly recommend taking dives from here. I used Chuck & Robbie‚Äôs for my PADI open water certification, and can‚Äôt recommend them enough. My husband and I had a private boat with Felipe, who was very knowledgeable and patient. We were able to be trained in Hol Chan and Esmeralda Canyons, which were unbelievable! We saw nurse sharks, hammerhead sharks, eels, lobsters, turtles, and more. 

3. Check out the local spots for delicious and affordable food. We loved Yoli‚Äôs Deli, and we were also recommended to go to Brianna‚Äôs, Warugamas (for papusas), and Sixteen Ounces (coffee). 

4. If you want to cook, buy groceries before you get to San Pedro. Prices are much cheaper in Chetumal, the mainland, or Caye Caulker. 

5. Similarly, buy your sunscreen and bug spray before you get to San Pedro or Caye Caulker. 

6. Confirm the location of the ferry stop you‚Äôre planning to take if walking to your next location is a concern. The stop to/from Belize City and Caye Caulker moved a 15 minute walk south, by Isla Bonita Boat Club. The stop to/from Chetumal is on the west side of the island, by the International Ferry Terminal. 

7. Buy ferry tickets once you know your departure time. My husband and I decided to play it by ear, and buy tickets day off. All boat times for San Pedro Express were sold out except for one.

Maya inherited the old farmhouse after her grandmother passed, tucked in a forgotten stretch of the Appalachian woods. A place where fog slithered between the trees like living breath, and silence clung too thickly for comfort. The house was crumbling, yes‚Äîbut not empty.

In the attic, she found the mirror. It stood eight feet tall, framed in twisting, knotted black wood like petrified vines. It wasn‚Äôt dusty. Not even a smudge.

At first, it only reflected her.

Then one night, it didn‚Äôt.


Maya was brushing her teeth when she noticed it. In the mirror, she raised her hand to her face‚Äîbut the reflection paused, watching her. Then, smiling faintly, it mirrored her motion a moment too late.

She dropped the brush.

The reflection didn‚Äôt.

From that night on, it followed her‚Äînot just in the mirror, but in whispers behind doors, in laughter that sounded just like hers, from the other side of the wall.



The locals had warned her, in the way that sounded like jokes: ‚ÄúThe woods got voices. Don‚Äôt talk back, or they remember your tone.‚Äù She thought it was folklore.

Until the mimic came.

It looked like her, down to the chipped nail polish and crescent scar under her eye. It spoke like her too, only off, like an echo from a throat that didn't quite understand speech.

Maya woke up one night to it sitting at the edge of her bed, smiling.

‚ÄúI love this house,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúWe love this house.‚Äù

She ran. It didn‚Äôt stop her.


In town, no one believed her. ‚ÄúStress,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúGrief.‚Äù But she knew better. She felt it, every time she passed a mirror, or glanced into glass. There were always two Mayas now‚Äîone watching, and one trying to survive.

She boarded up the mirror, locked the attic, and tried to move on.

But the reflection didn‚Äôt stay behind the glass anymore.



She met her friend Jules for coffee, relief flooding her. A chance to be seen by someone real.

Except Jules tilted her head and said, ‚ÄúYou were here yesterday. You told me you‚Äôd finally let go of your grandmother‚Äôs things.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù Maya whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been home.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Well... you hugged me before you left. You said you forgave me for not coming to the funeral.‚Äù

Maya had never blamed her.

And Maya had never hugged her.



By the time she returned to the farmhouse, the lights were on. Curtains parted. The door unlocked.

Inside, her own laughter echoed.

The mimic wore her face like a second skin, perfectly, except its eyes. Its eyes were hollow.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve made this body so cozy,‚Äù it whispered, stepping toward her. ‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt need it anymore.‚Äù

She ran.

It followed.



That was two weeks ago.

No one has seen Maya since. But the one in her skin walks the town, visits Jules, and smiles into mirrors that no longer reflect anything but her.

If you ever visit that farmhouse, don‚Äôt look too long in the glass.

You might not be the only one looking back.
And worse‚Ä¶ you might not leave alone.

~ I'm Black and Cherokee, I'm bilingual (English and Japanese), around 5'11"" but 6 feet tall on a good day.

~ On top of being your typical nerd I am also a huge horror movie fan to the point of considering making my own horror movie. I have a couple ideas and I would love to share them with someone who's interested in hearing them.

My name is Daniel and I'm from Southern California (the Inland Empire, specifically). I'm just looking for someone to have a genuinely great time with. I'm not a very picky person and I don't really care much for looks. I more so value your personality and how well we vibe, so pretty much anyone is welcome to get to know me! (I mean that in the most non-conceited way possible lol). I would just ask that you be 21 and older.

My interests:

~ I would consider myself the typical nerdy type (gaming, anime, comic books, super hero movies, etc.) If you like share any of those interests then I think we'll get along great lol

~ I'm Black and Cherokee, I'm bilingual (English and Japanese), around 5'11"" but 6 feet tall on a good day.

~ On top of being your typical nerd I am also a huge horror movie fan to the point of considering making my own horror movie. I have a couple ideas and I would love to share them with someone who's interested in hearing them.

1km49dz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1km49dz,I rizzed up my neighbor who was complaining about my friends,"It‚Äôs 10:21 PM and this literally just happened. My neighbor texted me super respectfully saying the cigarette and weed smoke from my friends (who smoke on my balcony when they visit) has been filling her apartment  and it‚Äôs triggering her allergies and her aunt‚Äôs asthma. She even said she can tell when someone lights up at 2AM. Caught the boys in 4K.

I apologized, let her know I‚Äôd be more mindful, and said if there were certain times she preferred we avoid the balcony, I‚Äôd appreciate it if she told me.

She explained how bad it gets and ended with, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre super nice though ‚ù§Ô∏è I appreciate it.‚Äù So I figured‚Ä¶ why not shoot my shot? I said, ‚ÄúIf you ever wanna hang out or grab coffee on the weekend, let me know.‚Äù

She hits me back saying she barely gets a day off because she works two jobs, but she‚Äôs trying to cut back  ‚ÄúWe should definitely hang out!‚Äù Then followed up with ‚ÄúThat sounds great! I‚Äôll take your offer.‚Äù

I was just trying to keep the peace‚Ä¶ now I might be her peace.

Here the lyrics :

She wakes up late, eyes tired and cold,

Coffee‚Äôs gone bitter, but she won‚Äôt fold.

Her smile‚Äôs rehearsed, and the world‚Äôs unaware,

Behind the mask, there‚Äôs nothing but air.

She steps into light, but it feels so fake,

Pretends she‚Äôs alright, but she‚Äôs about to break.

The phone buzzes, but she can‚Äôt reply,

A hollow ""I'm fine"" and a forced goodbye.

She hides the truth like a secret she swore to keep.

One last kiss, I love you like no one will do

One last kiss, I needed you and I miss you too

One last kiss, I need you like I need a broken Knife

The night falls hard, she won‚Äôt sleep a wink,

Her thoughts race on, faster than she thinks.

The clock ticks loud, but she can‚Äôt feel time,

The silence swells, drowning out her mind.

She laughs in the crowd, but it‚Äôs not real,

She‚Äôs waiting for someone who‚Äôll help her heal.

The shadows grow long, but she doesn‚Äôt mind,

Hiding the hurt, trying to rewind.

She dreams of a day when she‚Äôll be set free,

But the pain‚Äôs too strong, and she can‚Äôt break free.

One last kiss, I love you with a broken heart

One last kiss, I love you like a little freak

One last kiss, I need you like I need a deadly pill

One last kiss, I love you like no one will do

One last kiss, I needed you and I don‚Äôt miss you now

One last kiss, I need you like I need a broken knife

It took me about a week and a half to realize I was being laughed at. 

Was then proceeded to be called a ‚Äúdirty dog‚Äù by her manager apparently this girl has loose lips lol.

Made a promise to just ignore this chick because I don‚Äôt want toxic people in my life.

Today she tried to start conversation and kept it extremely short. The old me would want the validation but now I‚Äôm just so happy I can leave it be, no mean words, no putting others down just walking away and never looking back.

1km4738,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1km4738/i_feel_empty/,I feel empty,"She woke me up a few days ago and broke up with me, no emotion on her face, just asked if I was mad, and if I wanted some coffee. 

She pushed me out, said I wasn't there, said that the love I give isn't what she wants. I'm too emotional, I don't give her enough sex, that she feels like dying because we don't do it twice a day. 

I was shocked. She was leaving me because of the normal amount of sex we had, not because of the love I gave. The life we made, the moments we've shared, the responsibility I took proudly as a stepfather meant nothing. 

She changed after she attempted suicide. She became angry, cold, I couldn't see the women I loved in those eyes anymore. 

I took care of her after she left the hospital, assumed responsibilities for her to feel safe, did what I could to make home, home.

I keep reading over these messages, trying to find resolve, looking for why she could just send me to the streets with nowhere to go, and without hesitation. I love her, I love the kids. I love our little family, but they aren't mine anymore.

She says she still wants me to be part of the children's lives, but I don't think I can. I can't look at her without falling to pieces, and she just looks on while hanging out with the man that hates me. 

I'm lost, I'm confused, hurt, angry. Angry at myself for not being what she wanted, angry at her for making me think what I gave was enough until it just wasn't. I miss her, I miss us, I miss me. 

My family has been trying to reach out, friends have wondered where I've been, but I'm still sitting on the same barstool that I have been for days, trying to find reason and my life back at the bottom of these fucking bottles.

I don't want to feel, sometimes I wish for more, sometimes for less. I don't know where I'm going, and I don't know what I'm doing. I'm here, I'm right fucking here.

The idea of having sex with someone who‚Äôs doing it out of obligation grosses me out. When it‚Äôs been a while it‚Äôs not a big deal for me to take care of myself and she‚Äôs often good about being down for some mutual masturbation even when she‚Äôs not down for full on sex. 

Sometimes she‚Äôs been really apologetic with me for having a lower drive and I‚Äôve tried to be reassuring with her telling her that when we do get it on it‚Äôs mind-blowing (true) and the frequency isn‚Äôt really all that bad, my previous relationship was a literal sexless marriage. Usually I avoid having my feelings hurt by this issue but sometimes I‚Äôll experience some short-lived sadness/loneliness over it but it‚Äôs not something I dwell on.

So anyways, this morning I woke up and my wife was already awake and downstairs having coffee which I learned when I texted her hi. Over the last couple of days we‚Äôve flirted and goosed one another in a way that often means that sex is imminent and we‚Äôd recently had a missed connection where we were both down but a logistical snafu put the kibosh on it. She asked me what I was up to and I said I was going to shower. I guess I got hopeful that maybe she would come up to join me so I dilly-dallied and killed time for a bit with my fingers crossed, but no dice. I was a little disappointed but not the end of the world. Instead of showering I headed downstairs for some coffee of my own, when I saw my wife I said, in what I intended as a joking tone, ‚ÄúWell I gave up on waiting for you to come join me in the shower.‚Äù  This set things off.

She got really mad and said I was a big jerk for saying this and that I was acting like a 50‚Äôs misogynist husband for punishing her for not ‚Äúperforming her duties‚Äù and what a dick I was. I admit that maybe I did allow some disappointment to sneak into my tone but I wasn‚Äôt trying to be recriminating. I feel like if the roles had been reversed that for her to say something similar wouldn‚Äôt have been outrageous or cruel.

When I got a little mad at what I felt was her casting me as a villain she got even madder and said now I was ‚Äúsilencing her‚Äù, I guess performing more of the misogynist domination that I‚Äôm known for. When I suggested that I wasn‚Äôt trying to make her feel punished and that maybe she had some insecurities that were making her feel attacked when I wasn‚Äôt putting her on trial she got even madder and we‚Äôve since spent the day fighting. 

tl;dr made a joke with my wife that I was a little disappointed that she didn‚Äôt come find me for sex and we‚Äôve spent the day fighting

1km43i6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1km43i6,"A preacher's dark secret: Sleepovers, porn and raping children","Joe Campbell says his calling is to share God‚Äôs love, but a group of women say he sexually abused them as girls. An NBC News investigation uncovered decades of missed warnings and failures to act.







TULSA, Okla. - The women have spent decades trying to forget, but some memories haunt them. The way the children‚Äôs pastor wrapped them in his arms. The terrifying stories he told about demons and the warmth in his voice as he promised to protect them. The chill of his hands on parts of their bodies where no grown man‚Äôs hands should be. The blood some of them found in their underwear afterward.








They can still picture the spaces where it happened: A church nursery. A childhood bedroom. His garage during a youth group sleepover. 







This, they say, is the dark secret behind the public ministry of Joseph Lyle Campbell, a magnetic Pentecostal preacher who built a national following with fiery sermons on sin, salvation and America‚Äôs moral decline. As Campbell tells it, he was a teenager when God gave him a mission: to share his love of Jesus with children. In the decades since, as he evangelized from church to church across the South and Midwest, he has repeatedly faced accusations of child sexual abuse, an NBC News investigation found. 




‚ÄúJoe Campbell needs to be in jail,‚Äù said Cheryl Almond, who says he lured her to his home when she was a teenager, pushed her onto a bed and penetrated her with his finger. ‚ÄúI just pray one day I can hear a judge tell Joe, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre guilty, and here‚Äôs your sentence.‚Äô‚Äù




Almond is one of five women who told NBC News that Campbell, now 67, sexually assaulted them when they were children in the 1970s and ‚Äô80s. In Oklahoma, Kerri Jackson says he molested her once to twice a week for three years starting when she was about 9. In Arkansas, Lisa Ball says Campbell invited her to live with him after she became a teen mother, then raped her repeatedly. In Missouri, Kim Williams had just turned 15 when she says Campbell reached his hand up her shorts at his parsonage. In that same home, Phaedra Creed says Campbell sexually assaulted her night after night, at age 14, while his wife and children slept upstairs.





They had been taught as children that God hears all prayers, but getting adults to listen was another story. Starting in the 1980s, when they were still teenagers, some of Campbell‚Äôs accusers took their accounts to pastors, to local police and prosecutors, to child welfare workers and to federal law enforcement. At every turn, Campbell denied the allegations and remained in ministry.







The pattern of missed warnings and failures to intervene repeated for decades.







Congregants reported sexual misconduct as early as 1983, when Campbell was a young preacher rising in the Assemblies of God, the world‚Äôs largest Pentecostal denomination. To the children, he was an almost mythical figure, anointed by the Lord with the power to speak in tongues, heal the sick and exorcise evil spirits. Parents trusted him to keep their kids overnight and bring them to youth revivals ‚Äî until some returned with stories about Campbell showing them pornography and whisking little girls behind closed doors.






Church leaders let Campbell continue preaching for years, freeing him to abuse more children, his accusers say. The Assemblies of God told NBC News the allegations reached its national office in 1988; the Springfield, Missouri-based denomination banished Campbell the following year and said the accusations ‚Äúwere reported to the appropriate legal authorities.‚Äù





Campbell didn‚Äôt let that keep him from his calling. He moved to the heart of the Missouri Ozarks in the early 1990s to start a nondenominational church and a youth campground seemingly named after himself ‚Äî Camp Bell, which he has described as ‚Äúa real life Neverland.‚Äù The faith community he built there became a haven for people accused or convicted of sexually abusing children, NBC News found. Campbell allowed these individuals to preach, teach Sunday school and volunteer with children. In 2016, he went to work for the PTL Television Network, a Christian station founded by the disgraced televangelist Jim Bakker that has broadcast Campbell‚Äôs sermons across the country.




Campbell didn‚Äôt respond to numerous inquiries from NBC News, which included letters, phone calls, emails and visits to his home and children‚Äôs camp in Missouri. After reporters contacted Campbell, the PTL Television Network, which also didn‚Äôt respond, removed years of his sermons from its website. 








Campbell says he started evangelizing at 13, dubbed the ‚Äúkid preacher‚Äù in the Missouri farm town where he grew up. He has described his childhood as rough and his father as abusive. As a minister, he gravitated to children from troubled homes like his.














Those children came to see him as a father figure, a rugged protector with inviting hazel eyes. Several said he taught them the abuse he inflicted was an expression of his love for them. Their special secret.








‚ÄúThat was Joe,‚Äù Creed said. ‚ÄúHe could comfort you and make you feel warm. Stroke your face, push your hair behind your ears ‚Äî at the same time, just looking for yet another way to draw you into him.‚Äù 






In telling their stories over and over, the women created a written record dating back to the 1980s. NBC News reviewed hundreds of pages of letters and emails, police and court files, and harrowing diary entries that Jackson wrote in looping cursive as a teenager.












Their accounts are also supported by interviews with more than two dozen people ‚Äî friends and family, former church members, retired law enforcement officials ‚Äî who say they learned of the women‚Äôs allegations years ago. Nine of them, including four men, described their own run-ins with Campbell as children. They said the pastor showed them pornography during sleepovers, handed them sex toys in his bedroom, made lewd comments or touched them in ways that made them uneasy.










For years, Campbell‚Äôs accusers felt alone. Anxiety attacks and relationship struggles stalked some into adulthood. Then, one by one, as if God had willed it, they found each other. Beginning in 2000, they developed a sisterhood around their shared trauma.

If their former pastor was on a mission from God to reach children, their bond gave them a divine purpose of their own: to send him to prison.





Their efforts failed every time. But last year ‚Äî inspired by the firestorm an Oklahoma grandmother unleashed when she accused celebrity pastor Robert Morris of molesting her as a child ‚Äî they decided to try again. 






On a sunny afternoon in December, Jackson, Almond, Williams and a few supporters gathered outside a Tulsa police station. Under the bright blue Oklahoma sky, a retired pastor asked them to join hands.







‚ÄúLord, I pray that you will use these women and their story to stop the awful abuse in religious settings by men who think they will never be held accountable.‚Äù





A moment later, Jackson strode inside. 







An officer pulled out a pen and notebook. Then, one more time, she began to tell her story. 








If the doors of Eastland Assembly of God were open, Kerri Jackson and her two siblings were there. Sunday mornings. Sunday evenings. Wednesday nights. Prayer meetings. Sleepovers. Vacation Bible school.







It had to be hell or high water for us to miss church,‚Äù she said. 







Jackson was in kindergarten when Campbell and his wife, Becky, arrived in Tulsa in the late 1970s. The Eastland children loved his elaborate puppet shows and the tales of good and evil he told on church camping trips.








Everyone could tell Jackson was his favorite. 






She was about 9 the first time the attention turned physical, she said. It was around 1981. She and a group of kids were at church making posters. Campbell said he needed to run home for markers. Jackson jumped in the car. Just the two of them.







At his house, she said, Campbell started acting strangely. Putting his hands on her. Following her as she backed away. She wrote about it six years later when she began recording memories of Campbell in a green spiral notebook:







I tryed getting away by going into his hall closet but he came in there with me.







The top of her head didn‚Äôt quite reach the middle of his chest. He crouched down, and she felt the scratch of his mustache. She remembers trembling in the darkness and asking if he‚Äôd ever touched other girls that way. 






Over the next three years, she said, it happened again and again.










Jackson journaled about staying the night with the Campbells after babysitting their three young children. After Becky and the kids went to bed, she said, Campbell put on the Playboy Channel.








We were watching some movie and he starting running his hands up and down my body, feeling me, and kissing me.








Then there was the night when Jackson said Campbell cornered her in his garage and locked the door during a church sleepover. He removed her clothes and directed her to lie on a green beanbag chair. Then, she said, he violated her with his tongue and raped her as other girls banged on the door, calling for them to come out. 



It hurt so bad, and I tryed telling him things like he‚Äôs to big, im to small and I was scared.



Jackson struggled to understand the contradictions. Campbell delivered soul-stirring sermons about Jesus‚Äô love and the lake of fire awaiting those who refused to accept him. How could a man so close to God do the things he did to her?





Some adults noticed the contradiction, too.





Around 1983, a Sunday school teacher and founding member of Eastland began hearing complaints from congregants who said Campbell touched girls inappropriately. Jackson, honoring Campbell‚Äôs instruction to keep it secret, wasn‚Äôt one of them. The teacher, who has since died, brought her concerns to senior pastor J.W. Ellsworth, according to four friends and family members who said they spoke to her at the time. The teacher told them that Ellsworth, who died in 2018, rebuked her for gossiping.






Soon after, Campbell left Eastland for another Assemblies of God church, in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, about an hour and a half from Tulsa. It was there that he and his wife invited 14-year-old Lisa Ball to live with them. Ball‚Äôs mother had left when she was 7; she‚Äôd gotten pregnant at 13. After Ball put the baby up for adoption, the Campbells were supposed to be her fresh start. The pastor had different plans, she said.







Around Christmas 1984, Jackson, 12 at the time, visited the Campbells in Arkansas and spent the week with Ball. One evening, Campbell snapped a photo of the girls together inside an old movie house he‚Äôd been fixing up for his youth group. Afterward, Jackson and Ball said, he molested them in front of each other. The girls never discussed it.





Campbell continued to see Jackson on return trips to Tulsa, but she started resisting his advances more forcefully, she said, and the abuse finally ended.





He moved on to a megachurch in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and from there to another Assemblies of God church in Versailles, Missouri. Jackson tried to move on, too, but as she entered high school and more fully understood what Campbell had done, she began pleading with God for permission to kill herself.










In 1987, the summer before her sophomore year, she got a call that haunts her. A friend from Eastland, Kim Williams, had been invited to travel with Campbell to Missouri to help with vacation Bible school. Williams asked her to come along.





Jackson‚Äôs heart raced as she contemplated whether to warn her.





For 38 years, she has regretted her split-second decision.






She told her friend no thank you, then hung up the phone.




She rode up front with Campbell on the four-hour drive from Tulsa to Versailles; Becky sat in back. Williams celebrated her 15th birthday on the trip. She was creeped out, she said, when Campbell‚Äôs brother scooped her over his shoulder as Campbell spanked her 15 times, and again when Campbell made sexual comments about a woman at his church with intellectual disabilities. 






But the moment that shattered her sense of safety came toward the end of the week.






Certain details are etched in her memory. The peppermint candy she held as Campbell stood behind the couch and started rubbing her shoulders. The rerun of ‚ÄúGunsmoke‚Äù on the television. The chill that rushed through her as he silently reached down the front of her tank top. 






He came around front; she focused on the candy. His hand crept up her thigh; she held her breath. He moved his finger; she jumped to her feet.









The phone on the wall was baby blue. She remembers grabbing it and dialing home. Bawling, she told her father she wanted to leave; she didn‚Äôt say why.






Campbell took the phone, she said, and, with his wife standing nearby, told her dad that everything was fine. Williams was just homesick. He said he would put her on the next flight to Tulsa.








That afternoon, she remembers the Campbells scolding her for disrespecting them.






She flew home the next morning. Afterward, Jackson called.


She asked about the trip. Williams lied and said it was fun. Jackson was quiet. Then she asked: Did he touch you?








Through tears, the girls told each other everything. Then they discussed what they were going to do about it.




That October, Jackson, 15, called Campbell and confronted him. They spoke for about 45 minutes, according to notes she scribbled afterward.
He said he thinks we‚Äôre being taped ... 
‚Ä¶told me he still loved + cared for me ...
... told me he would deny it all the way to the end.








She hung up, angrier than ever. Jackson was done keeping Campbell‚Äôs secret. At the urging of her best friend, she went to Eastland‚Äôs new senior pastor, David Torgerson. 






Torgerson appeared to take the matter seriously. That fall, he collected letters from Jackson, Williams and other teens who said Campbell had violated them.


Torgerson, now in his 80s, could not be reached by reporters. He took his findings to Assemblies of God officials, leading them to convene a hearing at the denomination‚Äôs Southern Missouri District Council in Springfield on Feb. 4, 1988. Jackson was summoned to testify.




She woke up feeling nervous. She put on a purple corduroy dress with a white lace collar that her mother had made.


Torgerson and Eastland youth pastor Larry Kloefkorn drove. As soon as Jackson walked inside, she was startled to see Campbell and his wife waiting in the lobby. She wrote about the trip in her diary that night.




Joe sat there and looked straight at me w/ the most creepest look on his face.








She retreated to a bathroom and cried. Then Torgerson and Kloefkorn led her into a conference room. Two dozen Assemblies of God pastors sat around a U-shaped table. Jackson stood at the center. The men asked her how it began, where he touched her, who she told. One asked her to describe Campbell‚Äôs penis.








Kloefkorn, the youth pastor, said it seemed that the men were treating Jackson like a defendant rather than a victim.




Afterward, they waited in the lobby while the Campbells told their side. Becky‚Äôs father, a prominent Assemblies of God pastor who has since died, joined for support. Then the men invited everyone back inside. Jackson felt as if she might throw up.






One of the men told Jackson to place her hand on a Bible, then asked if she and Campbell ever had intercourse. She must have answered too quietly the first time. When asked to repeat herself, she shouted: ‚ÄúHe tried, got it in me, and I got scared so he took it out!‚Äù








Campbell denied everything. At one point, Jackson said, he jabbed his finger and accused her of lying. 








In a statement to NBC News, pastor Don Miller, the Assemblies of God‚Äôs southern Missouri district superintendent, said none of the council‚Äôs current leaders were involved in Jackson‚Äôs hearing. He said the council no longer requires victims to testify in front of their alleged abusers in sexual misconduct cases. 












‚ÄúWe pray that those who experienced trauma from the actions of Mr. Campbell can find healing and closure,‚Äù Miller said.





Jackson was inconsolable on the drive home in 1988, convinced that the men didn‚Äôt believe her. Convinced that Campbell had them under his spell. She vented that night on diary pages lined with pink flowers.




God spared him, he says, and in the years after, blessed him with the power of the Holy Spirit. He was given the gifts of prophecy and faith healing. Once, he says, he raised a man from the dead.








And in 1988, he convinced the men leading the Assemblies of God district council to take his side, just as Jackson had feared. They shared their conclusion in a letter, which Kloefkorn said he reviewed, and allowed Campbell to continue leading Versailles First Assembly.














Seven months after the hearing, he invited a new child into his home.





Phaedra Creed had never met her father. Her mother struggled with addiction and was living in another state. But her pastor wanted to take her in. She remembers jumping up and down and screaming after Campbell told her. 








He and his wife went to court to make the guardianship official, and, in September 1988, they set up a room for Creed in the basement of their parsonage, a ranch home across a parking lot from the church.
The 14-year-old had caught Campbell‚Äôs attention while singing in the church choir, she said. He told her God had special plans for her. ‚ÄúMany are called,‚Äù he would say, quoting scripture, ‚Äúbut few are chosen.‚Äù






One night she was lying awake clutching her Bible after seeing Campbell cast a demon out of a man at church, shouting: ‚ÄúIn the name of Jesus!‚Äù It terrified her. That night, the pastor came to comfort her, and she felt safe in his arms.


Within weeks, though, she wondered if the real demon was the one tucking her in at night.






It started with a bedtime kiss on the lips, she said, and quickly escalated. Three months later, Creed sat in an interview room at the Versailles Police Department. Afterward, the police chief typed his notes:




THE SUBJECT JOE CAMPBELL ENTERED THE VICTIMS BEDROOM AND HAD INTERCOURSE‚Ä¶




A doctor‚Äôs examination confirmed Creed had been penetrated. Campbell was arrested and released on $25,000 bond. After a preliminary hearing, a judge found sufficient evidence to send the case to trial. 






While it was pending, Creed went to Springfield to testify in the same room where Jackson had stood. Confronted by the results of their earlier decision to let Campbell continue preaching, the Assemblies of God‚Äôs Southern Missouri District Council banned him from the denomination.






The months that followed were hell, Creed said. She moved in with her mother, who had returned to Missouri. Some church members accused Creed of seducing Campbell, whispering insults behind her back at the grocery store. They said Satan was using her to take down the church.










Back in Tulsa, Jackson and Williams said they received subpoenas to testify. The girls weren‚Äôt told the name of the alleged victim, but they were eager to support her.








They never got the chance. 






Weeks before the case was set for trial in October 1989, Creed‚Äôs therapist warned her mother, Rita Aye, that testifying might break her daughter, who had moved to a group home for children suffering severe psychological distress. ‚ÄúShe had gone through enough,‚Äù Aye said of their decision to not continue with the case. 








When the charges were dismissed, Campbell‚Äôs lawyer accused Creed of fabricating the story, telling a local newspaper the teen did it to retaliate after ‚ÄúMr. Campbell denied her request to marry a 32-year-old man.‚Äù




For years afterward, Creed panicked anytime a thunderstorm rolled in; it had been raining, she said, the night Campbell took her virginity. Eventually she learned to bury the memories, pushing the pain deep inside. 



After being ousted from the Assemblies of God, Campbell says God gave him a new assignment: to start a church of his own and build a children‚Äôs camp on 40 remote acres in the Missouri Ozarks.






The Family Worship Center of Marshfield ‚Äî later renamed Lakeside Family Worship ‚Äî had only a handful of members when it opened in an old Methodist church in 1990 but grew into the hundreds. Campbell soon launched Camp Bell on a wooded lot 20 minutes away. Volunteers added a swimming pool, showers and dorms for the thousands of children who visited.








‚ÄúFor one week the kids are separated from the world and can focus on God, and it changes their lives,‚Äù Campbell told a newspaper years later. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre never the same.‚Äù



As he was rebuilding his career, the women who say he abused them were starting families and quietly struggling to cope with the lingering harm. Cheryl Almond, who says Campbell molested her around 1978, thought for decades she was the only one.








After returning to Eastland to raise her own children, Almond finally built the courage to tell someone. She confided in her spiritual mentor, a longtime church member. 






The woman gasped: ‚ÄúOh my gosh, you too?‚Äù



Almond froze: ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚ÄòYou too‚Äô?‚Äù








The woman told her about Jackson, whose family had long since left the church, and about others who had accused Campbell of abuse. Horrified to learn he‚Äôd found a new flock of believers in Missouri, Almond sent Campbell a letter at Lakeside Family Worship in 1999.
‚ÄúAfter years of hiding this awful sin, God has instructed me to write this letter,‚Äù Almond wrote. ‚ÄúSuch a great pain you have caused to me, my family, and so many other great children.‚Äù




She received no reply.



Jackson was 27, newly divorced, raising a first grader and struggling with panic attacks that hit with such ferocity, they left her hyperventilating and vomiting. The first one came as she was walking near a forest; the smell reminded her of Campbell‚Äôs family farm in Missouri. Ever since, she‚Äôd been begging God to help her forget. Now Almond was on the phone, asking to meet. 






Jackson invited Almond to her house; Williams joined them. Around a kitchen table, they shared their stories, finding parallels. After years of feeling trapped by grief that no one else could understand, each of them felt empowered. Together, they decided to channel their pain into holding Campbell accountable.




Remembering the subpoena she‚Äôd received in 1989, Jackson called authorities in Versailles and convinced someone to pass her number to the victim in the case. A few days later, Creed called.




And then there were four.




‚ÄúJust knowing that I wasn‚Äôt alone,‚Äù Creed wrote to the women the next day. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt even express those feelings.‚Äù


Over the following decade, emails between the women describe a flurry of efforts to alert authorities in Oklahoma and Missouri. A message to the FBI went unanswered. Tulsa police told them the statute of limitations had passed and suggested they file a report where Campbell lived now. When Jackson tried calling the sheriff‚Äôs office in Webster County, Missouri, she thought she heard Campbell‚Äôs brother on the other end. He worked in dispatch, they learned. They filed reports nonetheless, but it didn‚Äôt matter.






Years rolled by, with no results.




Refusing to quit, Almond adopted a verse from Ecclesiastes as her mantra: ‚ÄúTo everything there is a season ... a time to be silent and a time to speak.‚Äù




In 2005, she heard Campbell was returning to Tulsa for the funeral of a former Eastland member and decided to act on it. A program listed him as one of the pallbearers. Afterward, Almond got in line to greet him.






She grabbed his hand with both of hers and reintroduced herself, according to Almond and a woman who witnessed the exchange.






‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòOh, I remember you,‚Äô‚Äù Almond said. ‚ÄúAnd I said, ‚ÄòWell, I remember what you did to me.‚Äô‚Äù






Campbell‚Äôs face reddened, she said, and he tried to pull away. Almond squeezed tighter. She told him she knew about all the other kids, too. 




Appearing flustered, Campbell stammered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù according to Almond and the other woman. 






Then she let go, and he headed for his car.



After years of calls to local authorities, the women‚Äôs allegations against Campbell became an open secret among law enforcement in Webster County. Two sheriff‚Äôs deputies ‚Äî each harboring suspicions about the charismatic preacher and his secluded children‚Äôs camp ‚Äî tried to investigate, they said, but no new victims emerged, and no charges were filed.





Susie Dodson, former chief deputy of the sheriff‚Äôs office, said she spent a year looking into Campbell around 2000 after receiving a tip from a community member about sexual misconduct. Dodson, now retired, said she regrets not doing more.






A decade later, Webster County detective John Everett said he noticed the preacher‚Äôs habit of showing up at court to support people charged with sex crimes. He also learned of registered sex offenders who attended Campbell‚Äôs church. Everett vented his concerns in a 2010 email to Jackson after hearing about her allegations from decades earlier.




‚ÄúMinistering to them is one thing,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúbut he takes it to far, in my opinion.‚Äù






Everett, now retired, said he couldn‚Äôt recall the names of the sex offenders. But an NBC News review of court records and social media posts found that, from 2008 to 2014, Campbell welcomed at least four people accused or convicted of sexual abuse into his congregation, allowing them to work with children.




Around 2010, a mother said Campbell tried to silence her after a female Sunday school teacher repeatedly molested her 14-year-old son, arguing that such matters are best handled within the church. The teacher ‚Äî who lived in a home owned by Campbell near his children‚Äôs camp ‚Äî confirmed that Campbell tried to get her to strike a deal with the victim‚Äôs family to stop them from going to the police. She later confessed to the abuse and was convicted of statutory sodomy. 





A couple of years later, Campbell‚Äôs wife, Becky, defended the church‚Äôs decision to let a man convicted of statutory sodomy volunteer with children at Lakeside Family Worship, writing in response to criticism on social media, ‚Äúleadership is aware and will protect.‚Äù The man who raised the issue said he was ostracized for speaking out. Becky Campbell didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.





And after pastor Stephen Shorey pleaded guilty to sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl he had been counseling while leading an Assemblies of God church outside Tulsa, Shorey found refuge in Marshfield, where he often guest preached at Lakeside and worked with children at Camp Bell. He didn‚Äôt respond to messages. In 2014, after Shorey was imprisoned for violating the terms of his probation, Campbell vouched for his friend in a letter to a judge, describing Shorey as ‚Äúone of the best Evangelists we have ever heard.‚Äù






Jackson and the other women knew none of this, but what they saw of Campbell‚Äôs ministry online was enough to make their stomachs turn. They found photos of him at his camp ‚Äî which he continues to operate ‚Äî lounging on a bunkbed and doing baptisms in the pool, surrounded by kids. 




In sermons broadcast by the PTL Network, Campbell ‚Äî now with gray hair and weathered skin ‚Äî presented himself as a defender of the vulnerable. In 2022, he talked about the many wayward children he and his wife had taken in over the years. Some still call him Dad, he said. 








A year later, he preached passionately about what happens to people who have been abused. They wall themselves off from loved ones, he said, and go through life mentally and spiritually crippled.




‚ÄúThey will turn toward drugs, alcohol, sexual sins,‚Äù Campbell said, his voice rising. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs because of a wounded heart.‚Äù





Only God, the preacher said, can heal someone‚Äôs heart.





After giving her statement to an officer in December, Jackson exited the Tulsa police station and let out a deep breath.





‚ÄúIm I‚Äôm OK,‚Äù she told the others.




Despite decades of disappointment, the women were hopeful. They believed recent changes to Oklahoma law might allow the statute of limitations to be extended.








While they waited to hear from the police, they spoke to others with twisted childhood memories from Eastland Assembly ‚Äî including two who singled out Campbell‚Äôs wife.




Sarah Boren, who grew up with Jackson, said Becky Campbell played sexually graphic videos in hotel rooms on church trips. And Jody Kirk told his cousin, Kim Williams, that both Campbells showed him porn and pulled out sex toys at church sleepovers; once, he said, Becky instructed him, at around age 12, to put a dildo down his underpants.




‚ÄúBecky not only knew,‚Äù Kirk said, ‚ÄúBecky was very much a part of it.‚Äù




As the stories accumulated, the women convinced themselves this time would be different. They had spoken to The Wartburg Watch, a website focused on exposing abuse in churches, hoping to inspire others to come forward. 












Then, in January, Jackson‚Äôs phone rang. The head of the Tulsa police department‚Äôs special victims unit told her there was nothing they could do. It was the same story: The allegations were too old. Yet another door slammed shut.




The police department made the determination after consulting with prosecutors, officials said. 




Jackson was upset but undeterred.








After rereading her childhood journal for the first time in years, she felt God leading her to track down a girl whose name appeared in it. Lisa Ball, it turns out, lived near her. Four decades after their nightmare evening with Campbell at a movie house in Arkansas, the women met in February at a Mexican restaurant, where they traded memories over chips and salsa. Ball initially hesitated to get involved. Then she learned Campbell was still in ministry.






‚ÄúI want to see him stop,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe needs to pay for what he did.‚Äù






The sisterhood had grown once more. And in March, as the women debated their next move, another door cracked open.








Oklahoma‚Äôs attorney general announced the indictment of megachurch pastor Robert Morris in response to child sex abuse allegations from the 1980s. Morris pleaded not guilty to the charges, which were built on a novel interpretation of an archaic state law with roots in Oklahoma‚Äôs founding on the wild frontier, originally meant to stop marauding criminals from running out the clock on the statute of limitations by fleeing the state.










The women texted each other: Could the same law apply to Campbell? If they shared their stories with reporters like Morris‚Äô accuser did, would that make a difference?






Jackson thought of all that she‚Äôd endured and overcome. The debilitating panic attacks and sleepless nights searching Campbell‚Äôs name online. The bottle of pills she didn‚Äôt swallow. The trigger she didn‚Äôt pull.



Campbell had taken her innocence, she said, but not her faith. God wanted her alive for a reason. And he had given her Williams, Almond, Creed and now Ball because he knew she couldn‚Äôt do it alone.






For decades, Campbell taught his followers that the Lord had a purpose for each of them.








The women had found theirs, and they planned to finish the job.

It's hard to include all the details so naturally some are missing. Anything in quotes is verbatim.

I (M23) have been seeing someone I met on one of the apps (date, 19nb) for about a month. On our first date, they left their phone on the table and I glanced them getting a snap, and I recognized the name and bitmoji avatar as my best friend (23nb). I was like ""Wow, small world"" and asked how they know each other. Their stories matched up, a couple days after Date added me on snap, Friend came up in their quick adds and they thought ""this person seems cool"" and added. According to the both of them, they just talked about music a couple times. 

Fast forward to this past Saturday, Date and I went to see a musical. After the show, Date let me know that Friend and them have hung out a couple times, going out for coffee and on a picnic, and Friend has become very sappy and romantic with Date, sending them poems and such, and Friend kissed Date during their picnic. 
Date w

Obviously shocked, I question why the hell I've been left in the dark on this. Date feigned ignorance, saying ""I don't know how Friend is, is that not how they normally are with friends? I didn't go into it thinking they would fall for me. I figured friend was keeping you in the loop, you two are *best friends*. I would have told you earlier if I knew otherwise.""

I confronted friend over text, saying ""You two have been hanging out? I was under the impression that y'all haven't met"". 

To which friend replied ""Oh yeah we went out for coffee"".

Having all the details and receipts, I said ""And?""

they replied ""And we went on a picnic"".

I replied ""You literally violated the first rule of bro code. Why did you keep this from me?""

""I thought you weren't pursuing them anymore, but you're right, I should've told you.""

I left this on opened until the next day. I reopened with ""I really just feel betrayed. We've been through thus before. When you broke up with [ex] and we had plans to go to the concert, I still asked you if you were OK with me going with her. I even knew for sure you had broken up, and I still asked you. You didn't even show me the same courtesy."" 

To which they replied with the following wall of text (names replaced):

""I‚Äôve been thinking about all of this constantly. I truly never wanted things to unfold this way. I'm sorry for the miscommunication, and I‚Äôm sorry this hurts. But I need to be honest‚ÄîI have strong feelings for Date. I didn‚Äôt plan for this, and I never intended to hurt you. After spending years feeling emotionally cold and disconnected, opening up to Date was something I didn‚Äôt expect‚Äîbut it meant the world to me. I know this puts us in a difficult place, and I hate that. I care about our friendship deeply, and I don‚Äôt want to lose it. But I also can‚Äôt deny what I feel, or pretend it doesn‚Äôt matter. This isn‚Äôt about choosing love against you‚Äîit‚Äôs about finally feeling something real and wanting to see where it goes. I truly didn‚Äôt mean to be secretive or disrespectful. I thought things between you and Date had faded, and I should‚Äôve checked in before things progressed‚ÄîI see that now. For that, I‚Äôm sorry. I just hope you can see me not as someone who betrayed you, but as someone who stumbled into love the same way you did. I don‚Äôt want to be your enemy‚ÄîI‚Äôd rather find a way to move forward with honesty and care.""

I tried a couple more times to get plans together, but friend just kept leaving me on read.

Date and I kept in contact for the next couple of days, but nothing deep. This morning I sent them, ""We have to stop talking. Even if it's not your fault, I can't let you come between me and my best friend."" And deleted them.

After two days of nothing from friend, I sent them, ""If you're gonna be completely unwilling to talk about this, do what you will. At the end of the day, you both went behind my back and kept me in the dark. I wanted to give you the chance to be mature about this and come to a solution together. I cut contact with Date, do what you will."" 

That's been on read all day. I do feel incredibly betrayed l, and the only way i can interpret the ""apology"" is Friend basically saying ""Yeah I shouldn't have done what I did in the first place, but I'm gonna keep doing it and I hope you can learn to be OK with it.""

We've been friends for 7 years and it just feels completely delusional for Friend to be putting it all on the line after two dates. ",1,1747188304.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

You remember, right? How the color of your eyes, a brown green like a forest blurred by fog, made me collapse like an ancient star. The way I shaped graphite to capture your beauty marks and singular tattoo. How I described you in painstaking, divine detail as if I've studied you for centuries. I could do it again, but it would be as empty as my eyes the day you told me I looked like a stranger. 

And now here we are. Pretending there's nothing here. Breathing as if our lungs weren't once separated by only skin, bone, and sweat. Going about life as if we weren't once a tangle of youth and ignorance planning to share a future. You don't know me anymore and I don't know you. But we can describe each other's flaws with the accuracy of William Tell Overture. 

We were blindfolded and holding each other's mistletoe, aiming for our problems. I thought you were holding yours as a shield. You thought I was holding mine over your head like a personal Damocles. 

A sad story and one without a good ending it seems. Modern day Orpheus and Eurydice. We have matching scars but I think you would be furious to know that mine are healed. 

Maybe one day you'll find someone who writes about you like I did. Someone who's paper and pen depictions make angels weep the same. To me you were a beauty that rivaled the awful way you saw yourself. And to you I was a pass time, a novelty, and a scapegoat. No matter how you write my name alongside your issues they didn't leave with me. You carry them, my amber scented Atlas. I couldnt hold the sky forever even when I thought you hung the moon. And I'm sorry it's crushing. Even if part of me feels a hint of pleasure in knowing you carry it alone. 

Vengeance tastes like your chapstick. Moving on smells like the coffee I made you just right. And accepting that part of me will always hold you dear looks like your eyes when I told you that you were like week old gumbo. 

I hope one day you stop filling the denial that your heart is mine with anger. Believe me, it helps. I will never know how you did it for so long but I believe you can do it. 

Cheers. To all the wasted moments of groveling and pain. We both kind of deserved it, no? Maybe you aren't ready for that.

1km3umb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFLSupercoach/comments/1km3umb/the_trading_post_round_10/,The Trading Post - Round 10,"**The Trading Post with CoffeeTim - Round 10**


The swings and roundabouts of Supercoach scoring continued in a week saw the both redemption of a few fallen premos, and the abysmal (albeit tagged) scoring of two high-priced premos in Daicos and Merrett who should present as key trade-in targets over the coming weeks.


*DEFENDERS*


**Jordan Clark - 519K**, followed up a score of 58 with a monster score of 146, fulfilling his role as the perfect 105 average player. Despite being second in line for kick-ins, Clark has cemented his role as the most reliable of the defenders for Freo and is the preferred distributor when rebounding from defence. Despite the 519K price tag, he's probably only priced ~20K below his assumed value of 540K. If you believe he has the capacity to average 110+, however, he could be a good inclusion for the price. Due to the 58 from round 8 remaining in his scoring cycle for the coming week, he shouldn't change too much in price so you have the luxury of waiting a week if you would like to bring him in.


**Sinclair - 529K**, returned to form against Carlton and has juicy matchups against WCE, GCS (at Marvel), and MEL prior to his Bye in round 13. He should slowly climb in price over these next three rounds so this is a perfect time and price to bring in a player who we anticipate will easily finish as a top 6 defender. Sinclair is the obvious choice to bring in this week if you already have Zorko, and can also sit in your midfield for now if - like most people - D6 is temporarily occupied by the outstanding ~~premium~~ rookie Z.Reid.


**Zorko - 531K**, played excellently and reaped the benefits of close-match scaling in what was a poor overall performance from Brisbane against North. With a probable ceiling score again this week against Melbourne, Zorko could find himself approaching 600K very soon. 531K is a bargain (although not nearly as outrageous as 501K last week) for a player who not only should finish D2-D4, but also provides a VC option most weeks. My pick for best value defender inclusion this week.


*Speculative Defence Picks*

Sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe...


**Jiath - 387K**, the two most recent weeks of 130+ are nearly enough to blind some coaches to the terrible 66 average start to the season, however Jiath now presents an opportunity to gamble on yet another mid-pricer. Two questions should inform your selection of Jiath 1) is he a keeper, and 2) is he a cash cow that we could flip to a premo down the line? For 1) the fact that his scoring came against weak sides when his key intercepting/distributing backline team-mates were out (any of Scrimshaw, Amon, Barrass) and he has no proven high scoring history suggests that no, he is not a keeper. For 2) this could be interesting, if he manages a score of 100 in the next two games (and note that Impey is out this week) he will rise ~85K to sit ~475K, suggesting that he may reach the 100K profit mark that denotes a mildly successful cash cow from here if he scores any higher over the next two weeks or avoids a poor score over the coming three. I wouldn't select him at this stage but he could be an interesting pick if you have plenty of remaining trades or have already tanked your season and are looking for a hail-mary.


**Holmes - 498K**, a great price for someone we hope will average 105K and has demonstrated the capacity to reach a ceiling of 140+. He has also unfortunately demonstrated a high degree of susceptibility to tags, and is clearly the number 1 tag target for Geelong, so may struggle to score against Port, GCS, and Essendon before his Bye. With the Mid/Def DPP, he's probably a useful inclusion to fill a D7/M9 loop spot in a complete team, and may surprise us with a higher than expected average, but this week there are better value options with more reliable scoring than Holmes.


*MIDFIELDERS*


**Rozee - 535K**, now a well established performer in his half-back role, Rozee remains a steal for 535K especially given he should get Defender DPP status in round 12. He is looking like a must have for the season to come, but the main hurdle to inclusion is his round 12 Bye. One possible play for those who don't want any additional players with the R12 Bye *and* who are looking to move Daniel (FWD/MID, 440K) along could be a sideways trade of Daniel to Rozee for a net 0 change in R12 Bye players.


**Dunkley - 539K**, with a historical average of 120 and high score of 202 against his next opponent (MEL), and the highest CBA count of the Brisbane midfield last week, Dunkley could soon get near the 600K pricetag and is looking like a prime trade-in target this week. Somehow only owned by 12% of players, it's seems that Dunkley is the best value inclusion this week and should be a realistic option for most players.


*Speculative Midfield Picks*

POD City


**Peatling - 452K**, touted as a must-have early in the preseason, Peatling has failed to live up to expectations with low CBAs and a variable role across mid/wing/back pocket/tagging. The absence of Crouch from the midfield over the past two weeks has favoured Peatling with respectable CBAs to go with his baseline high tackle count. Given Crouch's anticipated 3-5 week recovery time, Peatling should score well over the coming weeks and may be able to justify his  permanent inclusion in the Adelaide midfield. He's only in 4% of sides and has a tantalising price of 452K, and I would highly rate this as a POD pick if you are on the lookout for one.


**Steele - 497K**, a top midfield performer of seasons past, Steele has fallen to supercoach irrelevance over the previous three years, performing reasonably but not quite well enough to make it to the top 10 in the midfield rankings. Off the back of some decent scores ~110, there's been some chatter about bringing him in given the <500K price. For context however, he's currently averaging the same as Oliver but is 50K more expensive than his Melbourne counterpart. If you think he can wind back the clock then he's a huge POD given 1% team selection and the phenomenal run home for STK, but my recommendation would be to do everything you can to find an extra 30-40K and bring in Sinclair or Dunkley over Steele.


*RUCKS*

**Gawn (735K)** and **Xerri (681K)** are well out of reach for most players, and will be for the foreseeable future, unless you're willing to sacrifice the long term wellbeing of your team by sacrificing your few remaining cash cows. This means that when surveying rucks we are either looking for an R3 to lock up our flex position (which may be a bit early in the season to do) or for a value pick if you're wanting to swap out of **Meek (545K)** before he plummets in price. The most likely R3 picks are, in approximate and disputable order, **TDK (558K)** (assuming no Pittonet), **Cameron (571K)**, **Marshall (501K)**, and possibly **English (557K)**.


**Marshall - 501K**, sticks out like a sore thumb in the above list given his price, and he would be a great trade-in if you're looking for one especially given the WCE matchup this week.


*FORWARDS*

Some are looking to swap out of **Daniel (440K)** this week, and I wouldn't hold it against you if you did - especially noting he is a near certainty to drop in price over the next two weeks with the score of 51 in his price cycle. His role is somewhat compromised with Sheezel in the backline and Hardeman taking on some of the distribution role, but despite not being the best defender he is still getting kick-ins and did have 10% less TOG last week owing to a nose injury that exacerbated what was an admittedly poor outing. I would anticipate he bounces back with upcoming games against Richmond and WCE, so any price drop from here is likely transient. The choice to trade him out ultimately comes down to whether or not you have other pressing issues in the team (like rookies on field with an average score of 50), and I think there's no right answer about whether or not it's his time to go, but it's probably not a priority right now.

The established forward selections of Smith/Macrae/Rankine/Petracca/JHF are all sitting within rounding error of their appropriate prices, so there's little benefit in discussing them at this stage other than to say that they're reliable inclusions if you don't want to take a punt on one of the value options listed below.


**Peatling - 452K**, I didn't realise he had DPP status when I wrote the section above on him, but I'll add that the competition is much less tight in the FWD line, and if (a big, uncertain 'if') Peatling sustains his CBA role he could be F5-6 by season's end.


**Martin - 516K**, has been scoring excellently in his attacking defender role and we can hope he continues this if he's not relegated to the wing role that scored him a 53 against Collingwood in round 8. With a BE of 63, DEF DPP, a good role, and 6% ownership, Martin is shaping up to be a great (and seemingly reliable) POD selection.


*ROOKIES*


It was a tough week for rookie roulette last week, with **Hustwaite (169K)** being tactically subbed out at half time, and poor performances from **Boxshall (113K)** and **Fonti (160K)** for those who went a week early on their selection.


**Day-Wicks - 99K**, was uninspiring on debut with a score of 33 and 65% TOG despite not being subbed. Worth waiting a week here to see if he can score even 45+ to justify his inclusion at the low 99K pricetag.


**Boxshall - 113K**, scored 38 in 49% TOG which both says that he has a fair bit of upside left if his TOG increases but also that he may not have the tank to achieve that higher TOG. A really high sub risk, and we won't know if he gets the vest until late on Sunday when much of the round is done. He's a reasonable selection if we hope he builds throughout the season, but will probably be a slow burn with frequent sub games.


**Simpson - 119K**, a decent first game performance with a nice defensive role where he's permitted to push up the ground, could be a good selection if he's not the sub and you need a FWD rookie. Would be worth waiting a week if you're not forced to bring in a FWD rookie this week, but he looks promising.


**El-Hawli - 155K**, finally selected in the starting 22 and hopefully did enough to avoid the sub vest in upcoming matches, especially given the decimation of Essendon's best 22 due to injury. Has a nice DEF/MID DPP and is my pick for best rookie to bring in this round.


**Bews - 172K**, has a long playing and poor scoring career, and shaky job security with Stewart and Kolodjashnij looking likely inclusions over the coming weeks. I would watch for another week before thinking about bringing him in, and he is clearly the inferior choice for defender rookies this week.",6,1747188218.0,AFLSupercoach,1,1.0,False

Sooo yeah, probably should post this in a careers sub but thought I'd try here since I'd prefer to chat over a meal or if you're okay with even giving a tour of what you do, or whatever, I'd be game.

 Can take you out for drinks/meal, or cook you a Filipino dish. I live and work in Sac so flexible. Thanks in advance.

I love coffee, I've spent years trying to perfect a cup of drip coffee for my day to day drinking, I love a good cappuccino, and I'm a great personality fit here...but I don't know what I'm doing. I can look at the little printout that says the ratios and THINK i'm doing something right, then get some super polite and well meaning customers telling me I did it wrong and trying to explain what I should've done, which is so helpful, but there's only so much of that \*look\* I can take. The slightly pitying, slightly annoyed look. 

I've learned that macchiatos are no steamed milk, just a dollop of froth to mark the macchiato, but then i'm told by a customer that it's one ounce of steamed milk (to two shots of espresso) to 'muddy the waters' and then the dollop, and they say it with such conviction that I have no idea what to believe. My cortado was ""more like a cappuccino."" Okay, cool, Too foamy, heard. Then a customer looks at my cortado in the to-go cup and goes, ""that's it?"" Okay, they're probably thinking about the Starbucks cortado? 

We have only two sizes of in-house cups from a local pottery- 12oz (i think?) and espresso sized (maybe 3 oz?). I can't fit the cortado into the espresso cup so it goes into the bigger cup, which appears to be a standard coffee cup, so it looks like just a half filled latte because im still trying to figure out presentation. Or maybe presentation won't change anything. It just looks off, everything looks off, and we only have 12oz hot to-go cups. Cappuccinos and macchiatos are priced higher than lattes. Nothing makes sense to me. I feel like I'm RADIATING ""doesnt know what they're doing"" energy. Part of me thinks this is just imposter syndrome, but is it really imposter syndrome if I actually don't know if what I'm doing is right?

I'm terrified of a 'real' barista watching me make a drink and lose all respect for the coffee shop I'm working at. I want this place to do well (its circumstances are weird and specific, but to keep it vague, we're a nonprofit in a concentrated area that's saturated with coffee shops.) I want us to really nail the traditional Italian espresso drinks but we also need to create some signature flavored beverages

This is super winded and all over the place, I apologize for that, I'm just terribly nervous about going back to work tomorrow. ",2,1747187111.0,barista,1,1.0,False

If you're looking to create your own little haven at home, this post is for you. Let's discuss the best ways to design a cozy reading nook.



First, location is key. It could be a corner in your living room, a small space in your bedroom, or even a spot by a window. Once you've chosen the location, think about the seating. A comfortable armchair or a plush bean bag is a great choice. Add some soft cushions and a warm throw blanket to make it even cozier.



Good lighting is essential. You can opt for a floor lamp with a soft - glowing bulb or install some wall sconces. If your reading nook is by a window, make the most of natural light during the day.



Don't forget about storage for your books. A small bookshelf, a few floating shelves, or even a vintage trunk can hold your favorite reads. You can also add some personal touches like framed photos, potted plants, or a small side table for your cup of coffee or tea.



Share your own reading nook designs, pictures, and any tips you have for making it the perfect place to relax and read. Let's inspire each other to create our own little slices of reading paradise at home!

Whether it‚Äôs your first time on the Farm or you‚Äôve been radiating positivity since the Paul McCartney set, here‚Äôs a chaotic, heartfelt, slightly unhinged guide to the secrets, traditions, and inside jokes of Bonnaroo. I give you: The 45 Commandments of Roo.

‚∏ª

THE ESSENTIALS 
1.	Left side of What Stage = Bees. Trust us bro. They‚Äôre vibing. 
2.	Free showers exist. Usually near Plaza 6. Go early or late. 
3.	The Christmas Barn is sacred chaos. Go at 3AM. Don‚Äôt ask questions. 
4.	Secret sets happen in Outeroo. Keep your ears open and your sandals ready. 
5.	You can play Magic the Gathering in The Grove. It‚Äôs real. It‚Äôs glorious. 
6.	The Centeroo fountain is for YOU. Wear a swimsuit, or don‚Äôt. 
7.	The Grove is the official nap sanctuary. Hammocks, shade, peace. 
8.	Bring stuff to trade. Stickers, bracelets, weird rocks. It‚Äôs the currency of kindness. 
9.	Plaza 1 has coffee and sometimes AC. Bless it. 
10.	The arch changes every year. Take your sunset pic like a proud Roo-goer.

‚∏ª

THE DEEPER CUTS 
11.	The BonnaBoo Ghost is real. Appears at sunrise. Don‚Äôt disturb them. 
12.	Some campgrounds have 24/7 raves. Follow the beat, not the map. 
13.	Camp names get wild. ‚ÄúCamp Cunnilingus‚Äù was legendary. Go big. 
14.	People bring kiddie pools. Respectfully ask to dip your feet. Bring ice. 
15.	Roo Chutes = mud slides. Grab an air mattress. Regret nothing. 
16. Join in on the scavenger hunts. People hide cool stuff. 
17.	Walgreens has a freebie tent sometimes. Tampons, sunscreen, ChapStick‚Äîtake it. 
18.	Portable showers are a scam. Solar bag + privacy tent = elite. 
19.	Artists walk around in disguise. Look for sunglasses + bandanas + vibes. (Tyler the Creator is known to walk around after his sets in disguise) 
20.	Thursday sleeper sets are iconic. Even if you don‚Äôt know the artist‚ÄîGO. 
21.	Sunrise gospel sets might emotionally wreck you. Bring tissues. 
22.	Make a meetup plan every morning. Cell service WILL die. 
23.	Mark your tent lines or eat dirt. Glow sticks save lives. 
24.	Glow-in-the-dark duct tape = tent identification heaven. 
25.	Hydration karma is real. Give water. Take water. Become the hydration fairy.

‚∏ª

THE TRADITIONS & SUFFERING 
26.	Roo Baptism = midnight fountain dip. Bonus: in costume. 
27.	You will get sunburned. SPF 50. Reapply while sobbing to Hozier. 
28.	Losing your friends is part of it. So is finding new ones. 
29.	Poop at 6AM. Trust me. That‚Äôs the golden hour for port-a-potties. 
30.	There‚Äôs always one dude yelling ‚ÄúBONNAROO!!!‚Äù at 4AM. Hate him. Love him. Accept him. 
31.	Don‚Äôt leave Sunday night. The traffic is biblical. Stay. Chill. Watch the sun rise. 
32.	The Day 3 slump is real. Power through. Sunday will save you. 
33.	If someone gives you a pickle, take it. This is not a drill. 
34.	3AM arch photos are elite. No line. All lights. Big vibes. 
35.	Roo dads are the backbone of the Farm. Befriend one. You won‚Äôt regret it.

‚∏ª

THE CHAOS 
36.	Removed
37.	Removed
38.	The Silent Disco is for flirting. Or weeping. Or both. 
39.	Hookups peak Thursday. By Sunday, we‚Äôre all goblins in glitter. 
40.	People get married at Roo. Real, legal, full glitter-cannon weddings. 
41.	The ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs My Tent?‚Äù sign is a social hub. Leave notes. Meet weirdos. 
42.	There might be a naked slip n‚Äô slide in Outeroo. You didn‚Äôt hear that here. 
43.	SuperJam will change you. No matter who plays. Show up. 
44.	If you hear someone say ‚Äútrust me, it‚Äôs just over that hill‚Äù‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not. 
45.	And finally‚Ä¶ radiate positivity. This place runs on weirdness, kindness, and sweat. You are part of the magic now.

üíãüòçüî•üîûI was in such a rush to give away my V-card.

But I never imagined it would be‚Ä¶ to the man who had raised me.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so tight‚Ä¶‚Äù he moaned, voice low.

Yet‚Äîhis voice‚Äîfelt oddly familiar.

Finally, he gave a final thrust, his behind grinding to a halt. Then he reached over and flicked on the light.

We both froze.

‚ÄúLeah?‚Äù His voice cracked.

My heart dropped.

**Chapter 1**

My stepfather clicked off the television and turned to look at me. As always, when his piercing blue eyes fell on mine, I couldn‚Äôt help but shudder with excitement. John, my stepfather, smiled and spread his hands out in a helpless shrug.

‚ÄúWeatherman says it‚Äôs going to stay cruddy like this until tomorrow morning. The state has put a warning out not to go out on the roads.

Supposed to be the storm of the century. Looks like we‚Äôre hunkering down tonight. Just you and me, kiddo.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay, Daddy. I‚Äôve got some mac and cheese we can eat for dinner.‚Äù

My stepfather laughed and walked over to me. He wrapped his arms around me and squeezed me into him and I nuzzled my head into his chest, breathing in deep and enjoying his musk and the warmth of his body against mine.

He released me and held me out in front of him. I was wearing a pair of tight jean shorts and a white tank top and I noticed his eyes travel down and linger on my cleavage for a moment. I smiled sweetly up at him. He cleared his throat and met my gaze.

‚ÄúSo, honey,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwhat do you think of your new place?‚Äù

I looked around at my new apartment, not quite believing that I was finally on my own. After eighteen years of living at home, having my own space in a new town was an odd feeling. Mostly I missed the idea of being away from my stepfather. I could tell from the way he had been acting all weekend as we settled me in that he was feeling the same thing. He had been reluctant to see me off to college, and though he hadn‚Äôt said anything about it, his voice had had a wistful quality to it since we‚Äôd left the house the day before with a trailer full of my stuff.

‚ÄúI love it, Daddy. Though I‚Äôm a little nervous to start college.‚Äù My father smiled.

‚ÄúYou are going to have such a good time, sweetie. College is one of the best times of life. Just be sure to study hard, but also make room for fun. Oh,

and be careful about the boys.‚Äù ‚ÄúDad!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious,‚Äù he said, grinning. ‚ÄúYou are going to meet a lot of them, and being the beautiful woman you are, they are going to want to do things to you. Just make sure you only do what you‚Äôre comfortable with and make sure to use protection.‚Äù

‚ÄúDaddy!‚Äù I repeated. ‚ÄúEverything is going to be okay. I‚Äôm not interested in those types of boys anyway.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you say now. But I still need to warn you. Even though I‚Äôm sure you are already sexually active, it makes me feel better as a father to warn you‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sexually active,‚Äù I interjected.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not?‚Äù From his eagerness, I could tell that he was pleased by the news.

‚ÄúNo, Daddy,‚Äù I cooed, sidling up to him and wrapping my arms around his large frame, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm saving myself for someone special. I don‚Äôt want to just give myself away to anyone, you know?‚Äù

My father bent down and kissed the top of my head, some strands of my curly brown hair sticking to his stubble as he straightened back up and squeezed me tight.

‚ÄúGood for you, honey. I know the man that you finally give yourself is going to be very lucky. Even though I‚Äôm your father, I have no problem telling you that you are absolutely beautiful.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, Daddy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you, sweetheart.‚Äù ‚ÄúI love you, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù my father said, pushing me away from him once more. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs say we build that new coffee table of yours before the lights go out and we drown?‚Äù

**Chapter 2**

The storm moved in not long after. As a light rain began to whisper outside the window, my father gave one final turn of the screwdriver in his hand and dropped it onto the carpet. He sat back and looked at the coffee table in front of him. I was sitting across the room on the couch, watching with a bowl of ice cream in my hand. I enjoyed seeing the strong muscles of his arms tense as he assembled the various pieces, his face scrunched in concentration, his tongue absentmindedly sticking out of the corner of his mouth. I had always enjoyed watching him work. He had a special ability to lose himself to whatever he was doing, and being the extremely handsome man he was, the effect was intoxicating.

‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù he said, wiping his hands. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice, ehh?‚Äù ‚ÄúI love it, Daddy. Thanks for putting it together.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy pleasure, sweetheart. Of course, my favorite part is having you watch me,‚Äù he said, winking.

I grinned.

‚ÄúI like seeing you work. You get so involved.‚Äù

Just then a giant peal of thunder shook the windows of the house. I jumped, causing my father to laugh.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to worry about, Leah,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust a storm.‚Äù ‚ÄúSounds like a scary storm.‚Äù

Another peal of thunder cracked the sky. The light rain roared into a downpour, the wind lashing the windows and rattling the panes.

My father stood up and walked over to the window to look out at the sky. ‚ÄúAlthough I will admit, it looks like it‚Äôs going to be one hell of a storm.‚Äù

He walked over to the couch and sat down beside me. He placed a hand on my knee, my heart fluttering at his touch.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just have to play some board games. What do you think, daughter of mine?‚Äù

‚ÄúAs long as you promise that we aren‚Äôt going to wash away.‚Äù

My father chuckled and patted my knee. His fingers caressed my thigh as he looked into my green eyes.

‚ÄúI promise, love.‚Äù

Even though he was only my stepfather, John was the only parent I had ever known. My real father had deserted my mother before I had been born, and my mother had run out not long after. In the interim, she had met John at

an entrepreneur convention and gotten remarried a few months later. I think she had been planning to leave all along and had been looking for someone to trick into taking care of her daughter. Being the man he was, my stepfather had had no qualms deciding to keep me and raise me singlehandedly once my mother had fled. As he had told me more than once, despite not being technically related, he had known from the moment he had seen me that I was the love of his life.

A man in his late thirties, my stepfather was quite the catch. He was tall, about 6‚Äô2‚Äù, and overwhelmingly handsome, with a penetrating gaze and an aura of confidence and kindness that inevitably made every woman he met swoon. Growing up, I had been the playmate of choice for many of the kids in class just so their mothers would have a chance to talk to John whenever he came to pick me up or drop me off. It wasn‚Äôt unusual for women to slyly hand them their phone numbers in the grocery store or to interrupt us at restaurants to flirt. And it had never failed to amaze me how my stepfather had handled each of these situations, graciously turning down the women.

Because in all the years I had been cognizant enough to notice the world around me, I couldn‚Äôt ever remember him dating. A self-made millionaire who had retired after my mother left, his sole task had been to take care of me, always giving me the best and making sure that I was happy in every way. I had asked him once or twice why he wasn‚Äôt interested in the women he met, some of them stunningly beautiful, but he had always just shrugged in that adorable way of his.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because you‚Äôre all I need,‚Äù he would say.

**Chapter 3**

So it was only natural for me to grow up loving him as much as I did. And somewhere along the way, what had been a girlish attachment on my part to my father had suddenly blossomed into a romantic love for him.

Not that I ever planned on telling him that. I was smart enough to know that most people would consider my feelings for my stepfather to be wrong. Though I didn‚Äôt think my stepfather would be one of those people, I still didn‚Äôt want to chance it. Still, in some corner of my heart I had been holding out the hope that he felt the same way about me, and this was why I had never been interested in any of the boys in my classes, and why, when all the other girls were talking about blowjobs and sex and getting fingered for the first time, I had shied away and not participated in their discussions. Truth be told, I was saving myself, my virginity, for the man I wasn‚Äôt sure would ever take it.

‚ÄúLeah? Leah!‚Äù My father‚Äôs sharp voice broke through my thoughts, snapping me back to the present. Another roll of thunder shook the windows. I turned to look at my father. My hand went down to his on my bared knee, and I smiled.

‚ÄúSorry, Daddy,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWas lost in thought.‚Äù ‚ÄúI can tell. You doing okay?‚Äù

I sighed and laid my head against his shoulder. My father leaned his head down against mine and our fingers interlocked.

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm doing okay, Daddy. Just feeling overwhelmed with this whole growing up thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou and me both,‚Äù he said, his wistful voice lost to the thunder.

BOOM!

A giant seemed to stomp on the roof of the apartment building and the lights flickered and went out. Suddenly, it was eerily quiet, even the background noises of little electronics whirring in their boxes extinguished.

‚ÄúWell, I guess that‚Äôs that,‚Äù my stepfather said, tossing his cards onto the new coffee table. ‚ÄúHow are you feeling? Do you want to keep playing? We can get the flashlights and hold them between our teeth.‚Äù

I yawned.

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm pretty tired, Daddy. It‚Äôs been a long day. Maybe we should just go to bed.‚Äù

Alright. Let‚Äôs do it, baby.‚Äù

I felt a hand touch my leg in the dark and I reached down and grabbed it. ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù my stepfather said, pushing himself up from the couch and

pulling me up to my feet. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go brush our teeth.‚Äù

After we had gotten ready for bed, using our phones in the dark to navigate our way to the bathroom, we returned to the living room, standing close to one another in the dark.

‚ÄúOkay, Daddy. I‚Äôll take the couch and you can have my bed.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, silly. You‚Äôre too tall for the couch.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, thank you. Are you going to be okay out here?‚Äù ‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, just wake me up if you need anything.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay. I love you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you, too. Goodnight.‚Äù

I heard my father move across the room, his footsteps disappearing into my bedroom. Sighing, I unbuttoned my pants and slipped them off. It was too dark and I was too tired to rummage through one of my packed boxes for a pair of pajamas. I would just have to sleep in my underwear. I reached behind my back and unsnapped my bra. I pulled the straps over my arms one at a time and then pulled out my bra from the top of my tank top. In the darkness, I ran my hands up under my shirt, feeling my smooth, flat belly. I gently stroked the underside of my breasts. Cupping them, I began to massage them slowly. This was a game I liked to play; As I touched myself, I closed my eyes and imagined my hands were my father‚Äôs. I bit my lip and pinched my

nipples with my thumbs and forefingers and rolled them back and forth. ‚ÄúAre you okay out there?‚Äù my father called from the bedroom

I froze, my erect nipples between my fingers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good,‚Äù I called back.

**Chapter 4**

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need any more blankets?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I should be good.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. Goodnight! I‚Äôll see you in the morning.‚Äù

I let go of my breasts and sat down on the couch. I rummaged around for the pillow I had been sitting on earlier and positioned it at one end of the sofa. I stretched out and pulled a blanket over me. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I looked around the apartment, taking in all of the unfamiliar shapes that now constituted my home. It was such a strange feeling to know that this was my new life. No more lazy Saturday mornings watching cartoons with my father. No more daily hugs. No more dinners or lunches or breakfasts. I had known this day was coming, but with all the fantasies I had harbored, I had never truly believed it.

Another loud crack of thunder broke the deafening silence of the room, making me shiver under the blanket. Soon my stepfather would be gone and it would be just me who would have to face these storms alone. Having him here I felt safe from the rain lashing the windows and the wind howling amongst the unfamiliar trees. How was I going to live without him?

On the next crack of thunder, I broke. Standing up cautiously, I moved across the living room, shuffling my feet to avoid tripping on the various knickknacks scattered about the floor. At the door to the bedroom I paused to listen. My father‚Äôs breathing was even; he seemed to be asleep. I stood there for a moment, undecided. Then lightning flashed again and the weird shadows cast about the apartment returned and I gave in.

‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù I whispered.

My father‚Äôs breathing remained unchanged. I spoke again, the second time a little louder.

‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù

My father shifted in the dark, and I saw the dim outline of him shift and rise up off the bed.

‚ÄúLeah, what is it?‚Äù ‚ÄúDaddy, I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù ‚ÄúOf the storm?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, baby. It‚Äôs okay. There‚Äôs nothing to worry about.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you mind if I sleep with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course not. There‚Äôs plenty of room. Here,‚Äù my father moved aside and patted the bed beside him, ‚Äúclimb on in.‚Äù

I moved across the room and cautiously climbed into bed. I stretched my feet under the sheets and my toes touched my father‚Äôs bare calf. I nestled in further, lying down and pulling a blanket above my shoulders.

Thunder boomed again and I flinched and scooted closer to my father. His arms were behind his head, and I laid my head gently on his chest. He was not wearing a shirt; my cheek was pressed against his warm skin. I draped a hand over his stomach, squeezing my hand around his waist. I placed my legs against his. It was then I realized he was only wearing boxer briefs.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, honey,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be in bed with me. If you want, you can hand me my shirt and pants from the ground and I‚Äôll put them on.‚Äù

I squeezed his waist and snuggled my head into his chest.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind, Daddy,‚Äù I breathed softly. ‚ÄúI like your warmth. I feel so safe in your arms.‚Äù

My father wrapped his arm around me, his fingers caressing my shoulder. I mewled a bit and slid my leg against his.

‚ÄúThank you, Daddy,‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúAnytime, sweetheart.‚Äù From his tone, I could tell he was smiling. ‚ÄúI need to soak it in while I can. Soon you are going to be gone away for good. I‚Äôm going to miss you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to miss you, too. You‚Äôll have to come visit me. You promise?‚Äù ‚ÄúI promise. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre going to forget about your old father soon

enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not old.‚Äù

‚ÄúOlder than you,‚Äù he laughed.

‚ÄúBut not old. If anything, you‚Äôre perfect.‚Äù He laughed again and squeezed me tight. ‚ÄúThanks, love. It‚Äôs good to hear that.‚Äù

We lay there listening to the sound of the rain beat on the roof above us. It was my dream come true. I was in bed with my father, my face against his chest, his arm around me. Absentmindedly, I ran my fingers across his stomach, feeling the tight muscles of his abdomen.

Let‚Äôs cut to the chase: 2025 isn‚Äôt just another year on the calendar. It‚Äôs the moment technology stopped being a tool and started becoming a *partner* in reshaping our world. From AI making decisions *for us* to quantum computers cracking codes we once thought unbreakable, we‚Äôre living in a sci-fi movie‚Äîexcept it‚Äôs real.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: **This isn‚Äôt just about gadgets.** It‚Äôs about how these innovations are rewriting the rules of business, creativity, and even survival. So, grab your coffee (or green juice‚Äîno judgment), and let‚Äôs dive into the five tech trends *everyone* needs to know about.

# 1. AI Agents: Your New Co-Workers (No, They Won‚Äôt Steal Your Job)

Imagine an AI that doesn‚Äôt just follow orders but *anticipates* them. Meet **Agentic AI**‚Äîsystems that act independently to solve problems. Think:

* A Cybersecurity AI that patches vulnerabilities *before* hackers strike.
* A marketing bot that designs campaigns by analyzing TikTok trends in real-time.
* A supply chain AI rerouting deliveries around a hurricane‚Ä¶ *while you‚Äôre asleep*.

**Why you should care**:

* **Speed**: Developers using AI co-pilots build software **40% faster**.
* **Personalization**: AI chatbots now have ‚Äúpersonalities‚Äù (yes, Google‚Äôs AI cracks dad jokes).
* **But‚Ä¶**: Only 24% of companies secure their AI properly. *Yikes.*

*The takeaway?* Partner with AI, but keep it on a leash.

# 2. Quantum Computing: The ‚ÄúMagic Bullet‚Äù for Impossible Problems

Quantum computers used to be lab experiments. Now, they‚Äôre solving real-world headaches:

* **Healthcare**: Simulating drug molecules in minutes (not decades).
* **Finance**: Spotting fraud patterns even Sherlock Holmes would miss.
* **Climate Science**: Predicting weather disasters with eerie accuracy.

**The catch**: Quantum computers can break today‚Äôs encryption. Enter **post-quantum cryptography**‚Äîa $20B industry by 2026.

*Translation*: Quantum‚Äôs a double-edged sword. Sharpen your defenses.

# 3. Green Tech: Saving the Planet (and Making Bank)

Forget ‚Äúreduce, reuse, recycle.‚Äù The new mantra? **Scale, innovate, profit.**

* **Green Hydrogen**: Fuel made from water + renewables. Market growth? **61% annually.**
* **Carbon Capture**: Tech that sucks CO‚ÇÇ from factories like a vacuum.
* **Energy-Smart AI**: Data centers using **quantum chips** to slash power bills.

**The bottom line**: Sustainability isn‚Äôt charity anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs a $200B goldmine.

# 4. Humans + Machines: The Ultimate Power Couple

Robots aren‚Äôt replacing us‚Äîthey‚Äôre *collaborating* with us:

* **AI Coworkers**: Robots using ChatGPT to understand vague commands like, ‚ÄúFix this mess.‚Äù
* **Digital Twins**: Virtual clones of factories, cities, even *your body* for testing ideas risk-free.
* **Spatial Computing**: Meta‚Äôs Quest 3 lets engineers repair wind turbines‚Ä¶ from their couch.

**The twist**: 54% of people can‚Äôt tell if they‚Äôre chatting with a human or AI. *Cue identity crisis.*

# 5. Cybersecurity 2025: Hackers Have AI Too (And They‚Äôre Good)

Cybercrime will cost **$10.5 trillion** this year. The villains? AI-powered deepfakes, ransomware, and bots that learn from their mistakes.

**How to fight back**:

* **AI vs. AI**: Deploy defense systems that predict attacks before they happen.
* **Zero Trust**: Assume *everyone‚Äôs* a threat (even your CEO‚Äôs email).
* **Global Teams**: Governments and companies sharing intel like Avengers.

# How to Thrive in the New Tech Age

**Embrace the ‚ÄúAnd‚Äù**: Use AI *and* keep ethics front-and-center.  
**Invest in Adaptability**: Hybrid cloud + quantum-ready systems = futureproofing.  
**Think Green or Go Home**: Sustainability isn‚Äôt optional‚Äîit‚Äôs your brand‚Äôs lifeline.

As Accenture‚Äôs 2025 Tech Vision warns: *‚ÄúThe choices you make now will define the next decade.‚Äù*

# Your Move

The future isn‚Äôt waiting‚Äîit‚Äôs here. Whether you‚Äôre a startup founder, a corporate leader, or just a tech-curious soul, one thing‚Äôs clear: **Adapt or get left behind.**

  
  


*Let‚Äôs build a future where tech doesn‚Äôt just change the world‚Äîit makes it better.* üåç

1km37rv,https://i.redd.it/psb3n5ouhn0f1.jpeg,Cocoa - supply concerns rear their ugly head (again),"Cocoa has set up a beautiful entry. We can see a high volume, high magnitude breakout on May 13, 2025. 
 
In typical years before the supply trouble started, the cocoa crop would be 4.5 to 5 million metric tons. The vast majority of that production comes from just two countries-Ghana and Ivory Coast. Both have struggled with weather and disease damaging the 2023/2024 crop and now affecting the 2024/2025. The typical harvest season is from October to March, so we have just finished up the main harvest for 2024/2025. There are smaller secondary harvests for Ghana in July-September and for Ivory Coast in April-September. 
 
The big news today was that the Ivory Coast beans were processed and 5% of the beans had quality issues, which is much higher than the typical 1%. 
 
The Ivory Coast typically produces around 2.3 million metric tons of cocoa per year. 
 
Last September and October, there were excessive rains in Ivory Coast, fuelling spread of ‚Äúbrown rot‚Äù. The impact from brown rot alone was thought to decrease production by about 100-150k tons. 
 
This was followed by a period of drought from December to February 2025 that stressed trees and reduced pod development. This was expected to reduce production by a further 300k tons. 
 
The current estimate for Ivory Coast production is around 1.8 million metric tons.  But this latest estimate knocks out 90k metric tons of beans in a very tight market that had been hoping for relief from this crop. 
 
Ghana typically produces 800,000 metric tons of cocoa per year. The cacao swollen shoot virus disease (CSSVD) affected over 30% of Ghana cacao land and destroyed 500,000 hectares of productive cacao producing land. 2023-2024 production fell 40% below target. 
 
The only solution is to destroy the tree and try to replant with more resistant cacao crop. The government has replanted 67,000 hectares of land with more resistant cacao crop however has yet to replace all of its production. The current forecast for Ghana production is 600-700k metric tons. 
 
Total supply estimates had been around 4.84 million metric tons, with cocoa demand is projected at 4.65 million metric tons. This means most forecasters had been putting the cocoa market at a 190k surplus for the 2024/2025 crop year, after a 440k deficit in the 2023/2024 crop year. 
 
However if 90k metric tons are knocked out of Ivory Coast production on quality issues, that takes the surplus down to just 100k metric tons, dangerously close to a deficit. 
 
Current warehouse stocks globally sit at 906k metric tons, which is down from the historic average of 1-1.1 million metric tons. Meaning that the whole 100k surplus could be eaten up by just repleting warehouse stocks to historic average levels. 
 
The demand breakdown for cocoa is 35-38% Europe, 22-24% Asia, 20% U.S. and rest of work making up 18-23%. 
 
Chinese demand for final product has been steadily growing at 5% year over year. While other countries may be more flexible in adjusting demand having already saturated their markets, Chinese demand may be more inflexible as there is a substantial growth component as more and more Chinese consumers get exposure to chocolate products. The vast majority of Chinese urban consumers have been exposed to chocolate products but rural penetration is still ongoing. 
 
I wonder if we could be in a situation like coffee, where the penetration of a new western treat is making its way from the big cities to new wealth in tier 3 and tier 4 cities. 
 
The COT tells us that speculators are the least long cocoa that they have been since early 2023, when the bull market in cocoa started. I think this quality issue in the Ivory Coast has taken everyone by surprise. 
 
I think this might be good enough for a trade. 
 
The demand destruction for chocolate products will be important to watch. Every year more and more people get started on GLP-1 drugs. The chocolate makers have all implemented strategies to promote non-chocolate candies. They are also dealing with substantial tariffs, and the consumer is unwilling to tolerate further price increases without meaningfully exploiting substitutions.
 
But what substitution is there for chocolate? Will U.S. and European consumers pay up for that chocolatey goodness? Time will tell. ",1,1747186284.0,u_jackandjillonthehill,0,1.0,False

She was my first cathedral.
I learned reverence from the hush of her presence,
from the way she made space feel safe
without ever asking for thanks.

She did not teach me with sermons, 
she taught me with silence,
with the curve of her back bent over a made bed,
with the stillness of her hands
folding laundry and holding grief
at the same time.

Her kitchen smelled like cornbread and coffee and cigarettes,
and even now,
those scents feel like scripture.
Like something holy happened there.
And maybe it did.
Because that‚Äôs where I learned what it meant
to belong to something gentle
and unshakable.

She didn‚Äôt speak of strength.
She lived it.
Not in fists or fury,
but in the staying.
The rising.
The knowing when to speak
and when to simply sit beside you
until your pain had a place to land.

She taught me to honor the feminine,
not because it needed protection,
but because it was sacred.
And when I asked her what a real man was,
she never gave me a list,
she gave me her life.
And I watched.
And I learned.

She loved quietly.
Worked endlessly.
Gave more than she had
and never kept score.
And even when the world overlooked her,
Mistreated her,
Scorned her,
She saw everything.
And remembered nothing.
She forgave. 
She carried everyone.

If you ever wondered
how I learned to love so feircely‚Äî
how I came to believe
that holding space is a kind of power‚Äî
it was her.
It‚Äôs always been her.

She didn‚Äôt just raise me.
She etched grace into my bones.
She built a home in me
I‚Äôll spend the rest of my life
trying to live up to.

Momma taught me to be the strength in the weak places. 
Momma taught me to use my voice when someone couldn‚Äôt speak. 
Momma taught me that manhood isn‚Äôt how you posture,
It is how you‚Äôre present.",0,1747186238.0,tuscaloosa,2,0.29,False

Baby has started to sleep for long stretches at night - his first stretch is always at least 4 hours and sometimes up to 8 hours. After that MOTN feed, his stretches decrease.

During these long stretches, I haven‚Äôt been pumping. I only get up to feed him when he wakes up. I had coffee with a friend whose baby sleeps 7hr stretches & she asked if I pumped in the middle of the night to maintain my supply, which got me thinking. Over the last couple days, my baby has started pulling at my nipple while feeding, and this has started to happen nearly every feed - now I‚Äôm thinking this might be because my supply is dropping. I believe it takes about 12w for milk supply to regulate, so now I‚Äôm wondering if these long sleeping stretches are harming my supply since my baby is still so young.

I called my lactation consultant and she said she thinks it‚Äôs a bit too soon to not pump for 5hr, so if I can, I should pump in the middle of the night if baby is going to sleep more than 5hr.

I want to try to take advantage of increased prolactin in the middle of the night when I pump, so around 2-3am, but the problem is my baby wakes up at different times in the night and I don‚Äôt want to pump immediately before he wakes up and then have to try to feed him with freshly pumped breasts. So I‚Äôm considering waking him up about 3hr after the bedtime feed for one more feed - around midnight - so I can then pump at about 3am and have a safe barrier between when he will probably wake up again (so theoretically bedtime at 9pm, midnight feed, let him sleep as long as possible whilst I pump around 1-3am).

Does this sound reasonable / normal?? My husband thinks I might be making a mountain out of a molehill and thinks our baby is growing fine (lots of wet diapers - at least 10x day), doesn‚Äôt think I need to go back to waking him up for middle of the night feeds, but he also doesn‚Äôt want me stressing and knows it‚Äôs my decision since it‚Äôs my breasts and I‚Äôm the one getting up at night.",1,1747186064.0,breastfeeding,3,1.0,False

1km34hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1km34hu/help_with_ongoing_intermittent_constipation/,"Help with ongoing ""intermittent constipation"" - Advice? Suggestions?","Hi everyone. I just read about 200 of the posts on here and am grateful to know I'm not alone but so sorry you are all dealing with this. I'm wondering if anyone has any advice or suggestions for me and my issue with what I've been calling ""intermittent¬†constipation"" that I am very tired and frustrated with.¬†



**Background**

\-37F. Petite, physically active, health-conscious.

\-Used to be a great pooper. I'd so much as smell coffee in the morning and I would go, *a lot*. Completely empty, it felt like almost the opposite problem. I would sometimes go multiple times a day, especially if I had an afternoon coffee. Anytime, anywhere.¬†

\-My primary form of fitness used to be running. Now I have a serious yoga practice (4-5x week advanced classes), plus walking/hiking.¬†



I had a fairly big life change (divorce, cross-country move..) 3-4 years ago, and shortly after that my pooping habits changed. I find that if I'm not ""in routine,"" it's extremely rare that I can poop. My routine 4-5 days a week is wake up at 6am, 1-hour of strong yoga, coffee, poop. The other 2-3 days a week, I struggle. If I wake up at the same time but don't do yoga, I rarely go. If I sleep in and do yoga later, I rarely go. If I sleep in and don't do yoga, fuggedaboutit. I enjoy my routine, but I can't be bound to it 7 days a week. If I don't poop in a day, I quickly get bloated, gassy, and uncomfortable, but the worse parts are if I have to skip my routine multiple days in a row. Long weekends are a good example, and travel makes me so much more anxious now. The anxiety and shame around it all is one of the worst parts - anticipating not being able to go and being increasingly¬†uncomfortable (physically and mentally) each day that I can't, or having to change plans around this very specific schedule I'm stuck in. I know 1-3 days might not seem like a lot for many of you and I understand that, but the discomfort and anxiety is very frustrating for me. Coffee is absolutely no longer a trigger for me, which I find interesting. I want to find some kind of maintenance routine to help me be regular again and  not worry about this all the time - either something(s) to incorporate into my diet/life/etc every day to help relieve this, or to take the night before/morning of ""off-days"" - whatever would help.



**Medications**

I've been prescribed¬†these medications and supplements by Drs at various points *after* my issues started:¬†

\-Levoxythyrine¬†50mg (diagnosed with mild hypothyroidism)\*

\-Vyvanse 30mg (was on Adderall 5-10mg for a while starting before my issues)

\-Iron\*

\-Vitamin D

\-Vitamin B

\-Uquora¬†(supplement to help prevent recurrent¬†UTIs)

\-Metamucil every morning

\*I know thyroid issues and iron can contribute to constipation, but I want to note that the poopy problems started first.



**Other factors**

\-One thing I want to make a note of is I got covid for the first time several months before I started having these issues...Could be nothing, but it's just something I noticed. (I do feel a little like my sense of smell has never been the same, which is interesting since as I said before, simply smelling coffee used to be a trigger and now coffee is not one at all for me.)

\-Another important thing I want to mention is the recurring UTIs. In the past, I had a few over the years, spread out (they are terrible!) but also around the time this problem started, I started getting them more frequently - one every 4-6 months. I started seeing a new partner in this timeframe too, so I figured it was related to that. BUT, I strongly feel there is a connection between constipation and recurring UTIs, and I've read a little online suggesting that may be a thing. I feel on my worst stretches of being constipated, I'm more likely to also get a UTI. I feel there is more pressure in my pelvic region when I miss a day and beyond, and the added anxiety of fearing both these problems really, really sucks.¬†



**Things I've tried**

\-Daily magnesium oxide and magnesium citrate supplements (not currently)

\-Liquid magnesium citrate (never again)

\-Miralax daily (not regularly)

\-Stool softener pills daily (not currently)

\-Increasing water (I probably drink \~120oz+ a day. I don't feel dehydrated, and when I do go, they don't either)

\-Increasing¬†fiber (I eat lots of salad/vegetable/beans, mostly vegetarian diet...I would think I get plenty fiber).

\-Fiber gummies (not currently)

\-My Primary doctor had no real suggestions

\-I saw a gastroenterologist. She said nothing seemed obviously wrong. She tested me for Celiac disease - negative.

\-No Drs have suggested I try any kind of elimination diets.

\-I saw a Pelvic Floor Physical Therapist a few times. I was very curious, especially bc of¬†my theory that¬†constipation and UTIs are related. She had me add 2x sets of kegals, 1x set of reverse kegals, and child's pose (with knees together, feet apart) and deep belly breaths every day, and then 2x sets of belly massage on the days that I think I'll have trouble. At first I was optimistic! I seemed to have an easier time going on my ""off days"" during that¬†month. I still do all these things and try to do some stretching on my ""off"" mornings, but it doesn't seem to be that effective. If I do go on an ""off"" day, it usually feels incomplete. I do not have this problem on¬†routine days ever.

\-If I feel backed up and try to go for a walk or run to get things moving, nothing happens.

\-I tried Smooth Move tea, but I got intense abdominal cramping several hours later (not an issue I experience), so I haven't had it again. Also didn't make me poop.

\-I've tried the Plums - inconclusive. I bought a 7-pack and have one left. It seems I have to eat a whole one in order for anything¬†to happen. If I eat less, nothing happens. One time I ate a whole one, I had a big result later that day, but another time, I didn't go until the next day, which wasn't that helpful, and they are also $$. I'm not sure they're reliable/consistent enough, but maybe I have to fine tune a system?

\-Adding more prunes into my diet.

\-This week I tried drinking some warm prune juice the night before a day where I expected trouble and then another serving that morning. I did not poop. I even tried putting a little butter in one of the servings which sounded crazy but I read it here...still no poop.

\-I tried eating a yellow dragonfruit like I saw online - nothing.

\-I use a squatty potty.



All the laxatives/stool softeners/similar things make me super bloated and uncomfortable so I really try to avoid them. I don't think taking them in smaller¬†doses can help me with a maintenance routine because of this. If I'm struggling, I've used an enema on occasion, but I don't want to get in the habit of relying on them, and I feel stupid using them after only a couple days - but I just get to the point where I feel so uncomfortable and anxious for relief. I wonder if something has changed between my mind/body connection since I don't really feel like I get¬†that urgency that I used to get, but none of the Drs I've talked to have suggested any further testing. I'm just bloated and uncomfortable and anxious and frustrated and shameful and willing to try anything to poop every day and feel normal and light and not crazy again. Does my story sound familiar to you? Do you have an idea of something I can try? Thank you so much and wishing everyone better poops.¬†",1,1747186001.0,Constipation,2,1.0,False

Hang in there it‚Äôs long.

Wedding morning: All of us bridesmaids and the bride are eating breakfast. The usual ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so excited. You‚Äôre so pretty.‚Äù After a while the bride starts talking about all of the stuff she is replicating at her wedding that she saw done at a friend‚Äôs wedding. Then one of the other bridesmaids (bridesmaid 1) starts talking excitedly about her wedding taking place that fall and some of the things she is doing inspired by the bride. Everyone at the table ooooos and talk about how fun it sounds and they are so excited and can‚Äôt wait. 

The conversation descends into the other bridesmaids talking about their weddings (past/future/pretend). Everyone joins in with equal support and enthusiasm. Bridesmaid 1 then get up to go to the bathroom and the second she leaves the room the whole mood changes and the two remaining bridesmaids and bride just destroy her. They start talking about how stupid a morning wedding is and that there‚Äôs no way in hell they are waking up to look nice for something that starts at 9:00 AM and finishes by 1 PM. Insulting her choice of light purple for a fall wedding. Complaining that she is taking ideas from the brides wedding. Mocking her not serving alcohol at the 9:30 AM reception. Trashing it being breakfast food. I mean they OBLITERATED this girl. 

She returns and sits back down and immediately everyone picks back up their earlier conversation about weddings. Bridesmaid 2 goes to meet her husband outside who was dropping off stuff for the wedding. The second she leaves they tear into her about how much they hate her husband because he‚Äôs ugly in their opinion and socially awkward and how bridesmaid 2 should be embarrassed to be seen with him. Bride started complaining about bridesmaid 2 even talking about her wedding because it was during lockdowns and only had 10 people - so did it even count? She returns with all the stuff her husband brought and the conversation goes back. All smiles and ‚Äúyour husband is so great. We just love him.‚Äù 

Bridesmaids 3 finishes sewing the  last minute wedding veil alterations and goes to get a shower. Immediately they start making fun of her not being engaged or married and how sad that is. The bride complains about bridesmaid 3 working on the veil so close to the table everyone was sitting at. They even start making fun of how quiet she. 

A little while later the bride is upstairs getting ready and all of the bridesmaids are together doing their own hair and makeup, all the while talking about how awful the bride looks because she was exhausted, that she had gained weight since the proposal, and that her dress looks cheap and ill fitting and making fun of the brides poor wedding planning.

It was unreal. 

When the one of them later gave a tearful speech about how the bride took her in like a sister in college instead of just as a roommate and how she is so kind and wonderful and truly the nicest person you could ever meet. I almost choked on my drink. Less than 6 hours earlier they were both talking mad shit about each other to their same circle of close friends who all joined in. 

I wish I could be a fly on the wall when they all find out how fake all their friendships are. 

Where was I during wedding morning judgmental gossip time? Minding my own business, ‚Äúreading a book‚Äù, drinking coffee at the table, and not engaging in the negativity.

I‚Äôm a 21-year-old girl, final-year architecture student. Lately, I‚Äôve been feeling completely emotionally scrambled, and this recent situation with a guy just confirmed it.

We were classmates, just acquaintances, until we started talking more this semester. Around the time I started Prozac, I got impulsive and overshared a bunch of personal stuff, and we weirdly bonded fast. He felt more like a therapist than anything else‚Äîwe got deep into philosophical convos, shared humor, and he actually got me. I had zero clue he was into me‚ÄîI thought he might be gay, honestly. When he confessed, I was shocked. I didn‚Äôt think someone could like me. Deep down, I feel like I only exist when people are physically around me. Like I vanish otherwise.

What hit me hard was that he seemed to like me‚Äînot my looks, but my actual personality. That‚Äôs never happened. I have delayed emotional reactions, so I didn‚Äôt know what I was feeling until hours later. My friends told me to stop running and just try, so I texted him something like:
‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ I processed things and I want to try, but let‚Äôs take it slow. We‚Äôll talk after jury. No promises, but I‚Äôm done running.‚Äù

We went on a date. He asked me out officially. I‚Äôve never been in a relationship‚ÄîI usually sabotage them before they start. But this time, I wanted to break the cycle. So I said yes.

We went to a bar after coffee. I had 2 beers, was ‚Äúsomething‚Äù and my SSRI (don‚Äôt mix, I know), so I was pretty gone. I was also sleep-deprived. We ended up sitting by the water, he kissed me (my first ever kiss) and it felt like a movie‚Äîbut in a dissociated, out-of-body way. I was numb.

I told him straight up that I have attachment issues, that I‚Äôm unsure, but trying. He‚Äôs emotionally intelligent and said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay, just communicate with me.‚Äù But I was too drunk. Boundaries got blurry. He kept kissing me. Later, I fell on the damn rocks and scraped my hand. Classic me.

When I got home, I passed out and woke up at 3am with a panic attack. Hangxiety hit hard. The whole thing rushed back like a nightmare. I feel awful. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm stable enough for this. I don‚Äôt want to hurt him. I feel like I‚Äôm playing with his emotions even though I tried to be honest.

I come from a chaotic home‚Äîmy parents‚Äô relationship was a mess. I‚Äôve never seen what ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù looks like. I don‚Äôt think I want to do this anymore. I‚Äôm a mess. I think I‚Äôm better off alone right now. I have an immediate urge to send a break up text at 4 AM rn

-------------------------------------------------------------

Burger King is known for its flame-grilled burgers and crispy fries, but what about their drink options? Many customers wonder, does Burger King have smoothies? Let's dive into the details of their beverage selection, focusing on the smoothie offerings, if any, and the ingredients that make up these popular drinks.

While Burger King has a plethora of beverage choices‚Äîfrom classic sodas to fresh lemonades‚Äîit does not prominently feature smoothies on its menu. Instead, the fast-food giant leans towards an array of refreshing drinks that can complement any meal. This doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt find fruit-flavored frozen beverages at all; in certain locations, Burger King has offered smoothies but not as a staple item across all franchises.

When smoothies have been available, they typically revolve around fruity flavors. Here are some examples of smoothie types that might occasionally be found:

- **Strawberry Banana Smoothie:** A classic blend that's loved by many, this smoothie usually combines strawberries and bananas with creamy yogurt or milk.
- **Mango Pineapple Smoothie:** A tropical delight that mixes mango and pineapple for a refreshing taste, often sweetened with honey.
- **Mixed Berry Smoothie:** This concoction may include various berries, like strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, bringing a burst of flavor.

If Burger King does offer smoothies in your area, they often come with optional ingredients such as yogurt or milk to enhance the creaminess and nutrition profile. However, the availability can vary by location, so it's always a good idea to verify with your local restaurant.

Aside from smoothies, Burger King has a range of other drink options worth considering. Here‚Äôs what you can typically find:

‚Äã Discover the delicious smoothie plan that lets you eat normally while you shed the weight! -Click Here to Learn More--&gt; https://freepage.pro/loganferret/smoothiediet   
- **Soft Drinks:** Settle with classic options like Coca-Cola, Sprite, and Fanta.
- **Iced Coffee:** For coffee lovers, the iced coffee is a perfect blend of rich coffee flavors and cool refreshment.
- **Shakes:** Thick, creamy shakes are available, with popular flavors that may include chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry.
- **Juices:** Orange and apple juice can be found on the menu, giving you a healthier option to pair with your meal.
- **Water and Lemonade:** Bottled water is always an option, and some locations also offer refreshing lemonade or iced tea.

It‚Äôs essential to note that special promotions and limited-time offers can occasionally introduce new drinks, including smoothies, so stay updated with the latest menu releases. If smoothies are critical for your meal or snack, checking Burger King's website or app before your visit is a wise choice.

For health-conscious customers, an important aspect to consider is the nutritional content of these smoothies when available. Most smoothie blends strive to use whole fruits, which means you gain the benefits of fiber and vitamins. However, some smoothies might also contain added sugars or artificial ingredients that could alter their nutritional value. Always read the ingredient lists and nutritional facts if you find them at your local restaurant.

Additionally, many diners appreciate having control over what goes into their smoothies. If you have particular dietary restrictions or preferences, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask the staff about modifications. They may be able to customize drinks according to your needs, especially if smoothies are on the menu. This personalized approach can enhance your dining experience at Burger King.

While Burger King may not consistently offer smoothies as part of their drink menu, there are various refreshing beverages available that can satisfy your thirst. Whether you opt for a soft drink, shake, or iced coffee, there‚Äôs something for everyone. And if you do come across a smoothie on the menu, don‚Äôt pass up the chance to try one‚Äîit might just be the refreshing treat you‚Äôre looking for!

A Comparison of Fast-Food Drink Options: Smoothies vs. Traditional Beverages
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you're at a fast-food restaurant, drink options can make a big difference in your meal experience. With so many choices available, it can be tough to decide between smoothies and traditional beverages like sodas or iced teas.

### Understanding Smoothies

Smoothies are thick, blended drinks made from various fruits, vegetables, and liquids like juice, yogurt, or milk. They are popular for their refreshing taste and nutritional benefits. Many people enjoy smoothies for breakfast or as a snack due to their ability to satisfy cravings while packing a vitamin punch. These drinks can also be customized to include protein powders or superfoods, catering to your dietary needs.

Here are some common features of smoothies:

- **Nutrient-Rich:** Smoothies are often filled with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, promoting overall health.
- **Customizable:** You can choose specific fruits, greens, and add-ins to tailor a smoothie to your preferences.
- **Filling:** Because of their fiber content, smoothies can be quite filling, making them a good meal replacement or snack.

### Traditional Beverage Options

Traditional beverages at fast-food restaurants typically include sodas, iced teas, coffee, and milkshakes. Each of these drinks offers a unique flavor profile and caters to different tastes. For those looking for something refreshing, classic sodas are hard to beat. They come in various flavors, from cola to root beer, and can be enjoyed with or without ice.

Here‚Äôs a brief overview of common traditional drink options:

‚Äã Discover the delicious smoothie plan that lets you eat normally while you shed the weight! -Click Here to Learn More--&gt; https://freepage.pro/loganferret/smoothiediet   
- **Sodas:** Sweet and fizzy, sodas provide an instant energy boost but are often high in sugar.
- **Iced Teas:** Iced teas can be sweetened or unsweetened, offering a lighter option compared to sodas.
- **Coffees:** Ideal for a caffeine kick, coffee can be served black or with cream and sugar.
- **Milkshakes:** Creamy and indulgent, milkshakes are often thick and sweet, making them a dessert in themselves.

### Taste and Flavor Profiles

The taste between smoothies and traditional beverages can vastly differ. Smoothies tend to be fruity and creamy, appealing to those who enjoy natural flavors. In contrast, traditional drinks may provide more sweetness and carbonation, which some people prefer due to their satisfying fizz. Your choice here often depends on whether you're looking for something light and refreshing or something rich and indulgent.

### Nutritional Considerations

If you are health-conscious, smoothies might have the edge. They often have fewer preservatives and added sugars, especially if made with fresh ingredients. However, keep in mind that not all fast-food smoothies are created equally. Some commercial smoothies can still be high in sugar, especially if sweeteners or syrups are added. Traditional beverage options like sodas are typically higher in calories and sugar content and can lead to energy crashes if consumed in excess.

### Price Factor

When considering your drink options, price can be a significant factor. Typically, traditional beverages like sodas tend to cost less than smoothies at fast-food restaurants. Smoothies are often marketed as premium drinks, thus they can carry a higher price tag. If you‚Äôre on a budget, it's worth checking the prices of various drinks before you decide.

### Health Trends and Consumer Preferences

Recent trends show that more people are leaning towards healthier choices, making smoothies more popular at fast-food chains. As consumers become more health-conscious, many fast-food restaurants have begun to include smoothies on their menus as a balance to traditional sugary drinks. This trend allows you to enjoy a guilt-free option without sacrificing taste.

Ultimately, whether you choose a smoothie or a traditional beverage depends on your mood, dietary needs, and preferences. Smoothies might align better with health goals, whereas traditional drinks may satisfy cravings for something sweet. Try experimenting with both options to find out which drink complements your fast-food meal better!

### Conclusion

For those seeking a refreshing drink option at Burger King, the quest for smoothies may leave you wanting. While the fast-food chain offers a variety of delicious beverages, smoothies are not currently part of their menu. If you're yearning for a fruity treat, options like sodas, iced coffees, and classic shakes are readily available. These traditional beverages match well with the savory BK meals and provide a satisfying, indulgent experience.

When exploring the broader landscape of fast-food drink options, smoothies stand out for their health benefits and natural flavors. Unlike sugary sodas, smoothies often come packed with vitamins, thanks to fruits and vegetables blended into the mix. However, many fast-food chains offer smoothies that might also contain added sugars and fillers, which can diminish their health benefits. The best approach is to check the nutritional information wherever available, ensuring you choose a drink that aligns with your health goals.

Ultimately, whether you prefer a classic soda or a nutrient-rich smoothie, there are plenty of options available when you're on the go. Fast-food joints like Burger King focus on delivering traditional drinks that complement their mouthwatering meals while other establishments may cater more towards the smoothie lover. As tastes evolve and health consciousness rises, it will be interesting to see if Burger King adds smoothies to their menu in the future. Until then, you'll need to explore your options elsewhere or stick with a drink that might not be quite as healthy but is certainly familiar.",1,1747185329.0,Smoothie101,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a 21-year-old girl, final-year architecture student. Lately, I‚Äôve been feeling completely emotionally scrambled, and this recent situation with a guy just confirmed it.

We were classmates, just acquaintances, until we started talking more this semester. Around the time I started Prozac, I got impulsive and overshared a bunch of personal stuff, and we weirdly bonded fast. He felt more like a therapist than anything else‚Äîwe got deep into philosophical convos, shared humor, and he actually got me. I had zero clue he was into me‚ÄîI thought he might be gay, honestly. When he confessed, I was shocked. I didn‚Äôt think someone could like me. Deep down, I feel like I only exist when people are physically around me. Like I vanish otherwise.

What hit me hard was that he seemed to like me‚Äînot my looks, but my actual personality. That‚Äôs never happened. I have delayed emotional reactions, so I didn‚Äôt know what I was feeling until hours later. My friends told me to stop running and just try, so I texted him something like:
‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ I processed things and I want to try, but let‚Äôs take it slow. We‚Äôll talk after jury. No promises, but I‚Äôm done running.‚Äù

We went on a date. He asked me out officially. I‚Äôve never been in a relationship‚ÄîI usually sabotage them before they start. But this time, I wanted to break the cycle. So I said yes.

We went to a bar after coffee. I had 2 beers, was on Xanax and my SSRI (don‚Äôt mix, I know), so I was pretty gone. I was also sleep-deprived. We ended up sitting by the water, he kissed me (my first ever kiss) and it felt like a movie‚Äîbut in a dissociated, out-of-body way. I was numb.

I told him straight up that I have attachment issues, that I‚Äôm unsure, but trying. He‚Äôs emotionally intelligent and said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay, just communicate with me.‚Äù But I was too drunk. Boundaries got blurry. He kept kissing me. Later, I fell on the damn rocks and scraped my hand. Classic me.

When I got home, I passed out and woke up at 3am with a panic attack. Hangxiety hit hard. The whole thing rushed back like a nightmare. I feel awful. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm stable enough for this. I don‚Äôt want to hurt him. I feel like I‚Äôm playing with his emotions even though I tried to be honest.

I come from a chaotic home‚Äîmy parents‚Äô relationship was a mess. I‚Äôve never seen what ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù looks like. I don‚Äôt think I want to do this anymore. I‚Äôm a mess. I think I‚Äôm better off alone right now. I have an immediate urge to send a break up text at 4 AM rn

Mikael smiled as he saw the name on the screen when his mobile phone rang.

‚ÄúHello my friend, how are things?‚Äù he answered.

‚ÄúHi, Mike. It‚Äôs good, how are things at your end?‚Äù Graham asked.

‚ÄúQuiet and a little boring now that the rogues have been dealt with. How are the Beans?‚Äù Mikael smiled.

‚ÄúGrowing at an alarming rate. I don‚Äôt know what Ellie is feeding them, but they are growing while I watch them,‚Äù Graham chuckled.

Mikael was happy for his friend. He sounded truly happy and content. No one deserved it more than Graham.

‚ÄúAnd Bella?‚Äù Mikael asked.

‚ÄúYou know Ellie, there is nothing she doesn‚Äôt excel at. I truly have no idea how I survived before I had her,‚Äù Graham confessed, and Mikael could hear the love in his friend‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúI have been admiring how well she has managed to cope with not sleeping at night. If it was for Theo, we would get a full night‚Äôs sleep every night. But Stella isn‚Äôt that peaceful, and since she wakes her brother, Ellie and I tag team.,‚Äù Graham told him.

‚ÄúI have been a walking zombie and Ellie has even offered to stay a couple of nights at her dad‚Äôs with the Beans so I could get some sleep,‚Äù he continued.

‚ÄúLet me guess, your alpha pride won‚Äôt let you admit she can handle it when you can‚Äôt?‚Äù Mikael chuckled.

‚ÄúPartly that, and partly because I wouldn‚Äôt get any sleep without her, and I don‚Äôt think I would be able to let the Beans that far away. I‚Äôve been thinking she was some kind of super wolf, managing her luna duties on no sleep,‚Äù Graham said.

‚ÄúThen yesterday, I needed to ask her something just after lunch. I could have mind-linked her, but why do that when I can walk over and actually talk to her?‚Äù Mikael‚Äôs friend told him.

‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm sure you only were thinking about talking,‚Äù Mikael smiled.

‚ÄúShut up. So, I walked into her office and the Beans weren‚Äôt there and Bella was sleeping on the couch. Of course, me barging in wakes her. When I ask her what was happening, she tells me it was her nap time. She and Mickey have been trading babies. He takes the Beans for an hour to let Bella nap, then she takes them and Mavis back so he can nap,‚Äù Graham said, sounding utterly surprised.

‚ÄúThen I asked if that is why she has been so rested. She says yes, and that she was assuming I was also napping during the day. Then she asked me the big question, why hadn‚Äôt I been napping since she has the Beans most of the day,‚Äù Graham continued.

‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù Mikael asked, curious why his friend hadn‚Äôt taken naps.

‚ÄúBecause Ellie hadn‚Äôt told me I should,‚Äù his friend mumbled.

Mikael laughed so hard that he was crying. He actually had to put his phone down for a moment to brace himself.

‚ÄúSome alpha you are,‚Äù he finally managed to say as his breathing returned to normal and he wiped his tears away.

‚ÄúYes, I have become useless without her,‚Äù Graham agreed.

‚ÄúAs much as I enjoy ravelling in your uselessness, I‚Äôm thinking you had another reason for calling?‚Äù Mikael asked.

‚ÄúI did. Do you remember the investigator down south that was obsessed with Ellie?‚Äù Graham said.

‚ÄúYes, didn‚Äôt he get suspended?‚Äù Mikael answered.

‚ÄúHe did, and then he disappeared. This was around the time the pups were born, so I didn‚Äôt want Ellie to worry. I asked the Mistvalley pack to have one of their agents look into it. Alpha Brutus was kind enough to put one of his best agents on it when he heard it was for Ellie‚Äôs peace of mind,‚Äù Graham told him.

‚ÄúYour mate is loved by everyone on the alpha council, I think,‚Äù Mikael smiled.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm well aware,‚Äù Graham grumbled.

‚ÄúAnyway. I have heard back from Brutus, and his agent has tracked Frank to your neck of the woods,‚Äù he continued.

‚ÄúAnd you wanted to know if I would grant this agent access to our pack land and a place to stay?‚Äù Mikael finished the sentence.

‚ÄúYes‚Äù

‚ÄúFor Bella, it would be my pleasure. They are welcome and I will make sure to give them any help they will need,‚Äù Mikael said.

‚ÄúThank you, my friend. It means a lot to me,‚Äù Graham told him.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it. Bella has always been a friend to my pack. I haven‚Äôt forgotten her generosity when we first met. Neither have my men, or Diana for that matter. They have been almost obsessed with me finding a mate since they saw how your luna is.‚Äù Mikael smiled.

‚ÄúEllie has that effect on people. Don‚Äôt worry, my friend, your time will come,‚Äù Graham told him.

‚ÄúYou know that I‚Äôm cursed, my friend. That is not in my future,‚Äù Mikael sighed.

‚ÄúYou are a full-grown alpha, Mike. You need to get over what happened. You are not cursed,‚Äù Graham told him.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Mikael agreed.

‚ÄúThat was not you agreeing with me, Mike. That was you trying to change the subject. You were a teenager, you had no power, and there was nothing you could have done. At least it led to some change in the pack,‚Äù Graham said.

‚ÄúIt did,‚Äù Mikael agreed.

There was a loud scream in the background of Graham‚Äôs call.

‚ÄúHold on one moment, Mike,‚Äù Graham said.

There was a moment of screaming and then silence.

‚ÄúHello, Mike. Sorry about this. Stella needed her dad. She can be such a daddy‚Äôs girl sometimes,‚Äù Bella suddenly said.

‚ÄúHello Bella, no problem. If Gray has another female that has him wrapped around his finger, does that mean I can finally snatch you away?‚Äù Mikael smiled.

Bella laughed at the other end. Mikael truly loved his friend‚Äôs mate. She was like a combination of a friend and a little sister. He had liked her just for the smile she had put on his friend‚Äôs face the first time Graham had introduced them. But she had become so much more to him since then.

‚ÄúMike, you truly are the biggest flirt,‚Äù Bella smiled.

‚ÄúTell Mike he needs to find his own mate to flirt with,‚Äù Mikael could hear Graham shouting.

‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt wrong, you know,‚Äù Bella told him.

‚ÄúI will keep my eyes open,‚Äù Mikael promised her. He hadn‚Äôt shared that part of his past with Bella, and he knew Graham wouldn‚Äôt do it without asking him.

‚ÄúGood, Gray has soothed the beast, so I‚Äôm handing him the phone. Take care, Mike,‚Äù Bella said.

‚ÄúYou too, luna,‚Äù he smiled.

‚ÄúSorry about that, Mike,‚Äù Graham said.

‚ÄúNo need at all, my friend. Family life suits you,‚Äù Mikael told him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm as surprised as the next one,‚Äù Graham confessed.

They talked for a while longer to arrange a date for the agent from Mistvalley to come, and some other things. As Mikael hung up the call, his eyes went to the little glass case on his desk.

It had been specially made to hold its precious content. On a midnight-blue velvet stand, the amber necklace he had got from Rayvin was displayed.

He had been looking for her for almost eight years. But it was like she had vanished from the face of the earth.

Even though she didn‚Äôt know it, Rayvin‚Äôs departure from the pack had been the beginning of the end for Mikael‚Äôs father as the alpha of the pack. Once word had got out about how he had banished the young girl, based only on what the Beta‚Äôs daughter had said. The smouldering ambers of discontent that had already existed, ignited.

It was clear the accusations of Milly had been unfounded and even if no one but Mikael said so openly, they all knew they had been outright lies. But as they lacked proof of this, the official version was that she had misunderstood something she overheard.

Almost a year after Rayvin had left the pack, Mikael‚Äôs father had officially been asked to step aside as alpha and hand the position over to Mikael.

Since that day, Mikael had worked hard on two things. He was determined to make his pack a place where anyone would feel safe and welcome. Fortunately for him, most of his pack shared his vision, and they had become a tight-knit pack with good values.

His second goal had been to find Rayvin and bring her home to where she belonged. He had never succeeded with that. And that is what he saw as the root cause of his curse. Part of him believed the goddess wouldn‚Äôt let him find his mate until he righted the wrong he had let happen. The other part of him still held out hope Rayvin was his mate.

It was pure wishful thinking on his part. Maybe the remnants of a teenage crush that didn‚Äôt get to fade away naturally.

Maybe he could get a feel for this agent from the Mistvalley pack. If they were reliable, he could hire them to look for Rayvin, Mikael thought. It was worth the steep price to get some peace of mind.

There was a knock on the door to Mikael‚Äôs office.

‚ÄòMike, it‚Äôs time for the meeting with the elders,‚Äô Ben, his beta, mind linked him.

‚ÄòI‚Äôm on my way. I have a new topic to add to the meeting,‚Äô Mikael answered as he got up and grabbed his tablet. He walked out of his office and joined Ben, that was waiting for him.

‚ÄúWhat is this new topic?‚Äù Ben asked as they made their way down to the ground floor of the pack house.

Ben was running his hand through his bright red hair. Something he always did when trying to get a grip on an unfamiliar situation. Ben was an excellent beta but needed to know everything about everything. He had significantly relaxed since meeting his mate, Diana, a couple of years back. But he still felt uncomfortable in unfamiliar situations.

‚ÄúWe are going to have a guest from the Mistvalley pack staying here. They are working for Gray and need access to the area,‚Äù Mikael explained.

‚ÄúSounds like fun. We wouldn‚Äôt want to get bored or anything,‚Äù Ben sighed.

Mikael knew that if his beta had the power, he would make sure that nothing exciting or unexpected ever happened. Luckily for all of them, he didn‚Äôt have that power.

‚ÄúIt will be fine, they will stay with us, but I‚Äôm assuming they will spend most of their time off pack land, investigating,‚Äù Mikael laughed and patted his betas shoulder.

‚ÄúWell, that doesn‚Äôt sound too bad, I guess,‚Äù Ben nodded.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the spirit. Diana and I will turn you into an adventurer one of these days,‚Äù Mikael said.

# 2, Going back

Rayvin was sitting in her car and was staring at the phone in her hand. The conversation she had had with alpha Brutus just moments ago still shocked her. She had expected him to understand why she had asked to hand over the case to someone else.

She had done most of the heavy lifting, and the man was a human. He wasn‚Äôt exactly hard to track. But her alpha had said no.

‚ÄúAuga, we don‚Äôt give up halfway to our goal. How would it look if I let you off the hook on this one? We always follow through on our missions. And this is for luna Bella, nothing but the best will do,‚Äù he had told her.

‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù she angrily shouted and banged her fist against the steering wheel.

She had a valid reason not to do this mission and alpha Brutus knew it. All the talk about sticking to the mission was bullshit. This was one of his ‚Äòface your demons and grow as a warrior‚Äô life lessons. That was the only reason she could think of for him to be sending her back to the one place she didn‚Äôt want to go.

The Whiteriver pack. Rayvin hadn‚Äôt thought she would ever think of going back there. In fact, she had spent years making sure that there were no traces that could tie her to that pack.

Rayvin took a deep breath and started her car, a silver-coloured Prius. It wasn‚Äôt the fanciest car. Which was the whole point of it. No one looked twice at it, it blended into most surroundings and was quiet to drive. Everything she needed.

She drove to a drive-through and ordered their largest black coffee and an array of doughnuts. If she was going to do this, she needed her two favourite drugs, caffeine and sugar.

She could fly up north and rent a car. But then she would have to use a fake name and even then, it would leave a paper trace. If she drove, she would have a couple of days to figure out how to handle this.

As Rayvin prepared for the long drive and fed the coordinates into her GPS she thought back nine years. The moment she had been dropped off by the bus stop, she had pulled out her phone and dialled the number entered as Emergency B.

‚ÄúBrutus Windwalker,‚Äù a man had answered.

At first, Rayvin hadn‚Äôt known what to say. She had remained silent until the alpha had asked if there was anyone there.

Rayvin had told him who she was and what had happened in a shaky voice. It had taken her almost half an hour to tell him everything.

‚ÄúWhere does the bus go?‚Äù alpha Brutus had asked her.

Rayvin did not know, but after consulting the sign at the bus stop, she told him the end destination was Detroit.

‚ÄúDo you have enough money to buy a ticket?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúYes, and to stay in a motel for a couple of nights if necessary,‚Äù Rayvin told him.

‚ÄúWhen you get on the bus, text me the time when you will arrive in Detroit. My men will be waiting for you. They will ask if your name is Auga. You can trust them,‚Äù alpha Brutus told her.

‚ÄúOkay. What happens then?‚Äù she had asked.

‚ÄúThen they will take you home,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúHome?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, your new home is in my pack. Your father was a good friend of mine, more like a brother. His daughter will always have a home in my pack. My men will bring you home and you will rest for a while. Then we will talk about your future,‚Äù alpha Brutus had told her.

Rayvin had seventeen hours to think on that bus. She had done a lot of thinking, mostly about her father, this unknown man that she only remembered from her mother‚Äôs stories about him. And about Mikael.

Even after all this time, Rayvin still got a pang of longing in her stomach when she thought about Mikael. The friendship they had shared had meant the world to her growing up.

He had been her hero, the brave and strong protector that, together with Ben, had been the cornerstone in her childhood escapades. As they got older, her feelings for Mikael changed. Rayvin smiled at the thought of her crush on the alpha‚Äôs son.

It had been innocent, and she had never expected anything to come from it. Mikael would take over the pack and he was good-looking. The single females in the pack had all had their eyes on him.

But Rayvin knew he was waiting for his true mate. His parents had been chosen mates, and he had lived with the consequences of their choice. He always told Rayvin that he would never do that.

In the first months after going to live with the Mistvalley pack, Rayvin had fantasised about going back. To wait until Mikael became alpha and then ask if she could return.

Then alpha Brutus put her in contact with her family on her father‚Äôs side. After the first meeting, Rayvin knew she would never go back to the Whiteriver pack. She would never contact Mikael again.

Instead, she had turned to the training. If her experiences until then had taught her anything, it had been that she needed to be able to protect herself. Alpha Brutus had her using her special abilities, training them to the point where they became just as natural for her to use as shifting.

Her abilities easily made her one of the top agents within the pack. In the Mistvalley pack results, strength and usefulness were what mattered. A useless warrior was treated as lower in rank than a useful omega.

As she was driving toward North Dakota, Rayvin knew that this was the final test from her alpha. If she passed this test to his satisfaction, he would name her beta of the Mistvalley pack.

If she could prove that she truly had left her old life behind her, she would cease to be Rayvin and fully become Auga, the alias that had stuck from that first day.

Rayvin thought it was what she wanted. But she also doubted if it was possible for her to do. When she had heard that Mikael had been at the battle with the rogues, every fibre of her had wanted to go and just catch a glimpse of him.

But she hadn‚Äôt. She knew a glimpse wouldn‚Äôt be enough. She had focused on her part of the mission instead, and tried to block out the fact that he had been there.

Now she was driving straight into his pack. There would be no escaping meeting him, talking to him, and then leaving him again.

Rayvin pulled up to a cheap motel. She could afford better accommodations, but places like this took cash and didn‚Äôt ask too many questions. When she was spread out on top of the bed in her room, she tried to empty her mind to get some sleep.

It didn‚Äôt really work. She kept making up scenarios of what would happen the following day. Rayvin knew he had been looking for her and she felt guilty for making sure he wouldn‚Äôt succeed. She could have reached out and explained things. She should have done that, but she always had the feeling that she wouldn‚Äôt be able to walk away a second time.

Walking away from him the first time had nearly broken her. She didn‚Äôt want to think about how it would feel if she did it a second time. Now she didn‚Äôt have a choice.

That wasn‚Äôt technically true. She could disobey her alpha, say screw this to everything. But what then? Go live with her father‚Äôs family? Become a lone wolf? No, neither of those things was appealing.

She sighed and turned on her side. She was just going to be a big girl and suck it up. Rayvin would go to her old pack, and she would talk and be nice to her old friend and get the job done. Then she would leave and start training for her new position in the pack.

It was well past lunch the following day when Rayvin started getting close to the pack borders. The landscape looked like a Christmas card and she allowed herself to admit that she missed the snow. They got snow at home as well, but not like this, she thought as she looked at the jagged rocks and evergreen trees that were covered in a thick blanket of snow.

She started to recognise the surroundings and her wolf and the other creature inside of her both told her she was home. Irritated, Rayvin tried to tell them that this was not home. But the stupid animals wouldn‚Äôt listen to her.

She stopped a little bit away from the turnoff road that would lead her to the pack land. She erased the location from her GPS and, out of habit, scrubbed its memory. No need to get sloppy just because she knew where she was going.

As she drove down the gravel road, she was stopped by the gates by an unfamiliar wolf in a guard uniform. Rayvin assessed him as he walked over to her window. He looked like he knew what he was doing, she reluctantly thought.

‚ÄúGoodday ma‚Äôam. Do you have a purpose visiting our pack land?‚Äù the guard asked.

Rayvin enjoyed the fleeting confusion she saw on his face as he scented her and could feel that she was a werewolf and something that he couldn‚Äôt place.

‚ÄúHello, yes, I‚Äôm here as a visitor. I‚Äôm the agent from Mistvalley,‚Äù she told him and made the effort to smile.

‚ÄúYou are expected, ma‚Äôam, your name?‚Äù he asked with a nod.

Rayvin would usually give one of her aliases, or at least give the nickname she used. But that wouldn‚Äôt do any good here.

‚ÄúRayvin Gullnauga,‚Äù she therefore said and watched as the guard mind linked someone.

‚ÄúSorry, ma‚Äôam, I need to see an ID,‚Äù he then told her. This time she smiled genuinely. Someone on the other end of that mind link knew who she was. She wondered who it was as she pulled out her real driver‚Äôs license from its hiding place in her glove compartment.

‚ÄúHere you go,‚Äù she smiled at the guard and handed him her license.

He carefully examined the ID and then looked at her to confirm it was her. He then mind linked with someone again.

‚ÄúPlease follow the road until you see the pack house, a large timber-frame house. You really can‚Äôt miss it. The beta will be waiting for you there,‚Äù the guard smiled at her and handed back her driver‚Äôs licence.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she smiled at him and waited for him to open the gate.

She drove the last part through the forest and smiled again as she drove across the bridge that took her over the river that had given the pack its name. As the forest opened up into the open area where the village and the pack house were, her animals once again told her they were home.

Rayvin wished that there was a way to shut them up as she drove through the village. She saw the gigantic pack house that stood at the foot of the rock formation at the other end of the village and the memories flooded back.

She focused on her breathing and did some exercises she used to slow her pulse in the field as she drove out of the village and started the final stretch up to the pack house.

She parked the car and got out.

‚ÄúWell, call me stupid and drag my ass over a cheese grader, it really is you,‚Äù someone laughed.

Rayvin turned towards the voice and saw Ben walking towards her from the pack house.

‚ÄúHello beta,‚Äù she smiled.

‚ÄúWhere on earth have you been, Vinnie?‚Äù he asked as he drew her into a hug. Rayvin was caught off guard, but she gave him a quick hug and let go.

‚ÄúAll around,‚Äù she replied.

‚ÄúNo fuck. Look at you all grown up and an agent of the Mistvalley pack,‚Äù he grinned.

‚ÄúLook who‚Äôs speaking Mr Beta with a mate,‚Äù she told him.

‚ÄúI would ask how you knew that, but the whole agent from Mistvalley explains it,‚Äù he laughed.

‚ÄúOh man, Mike is going to blow a gasket,‚Äù he then said.

‚ÄúYeah, probably,‚Äù Rayvin agreed.

‚ÄúHe asked me to send you up to his office. He wants to go through some things for your stay,‚Äù Ben said.

‚ÄúDoes he know I‚Äôm here?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúThat the agent is here? Yes. That it‚Äôs you? No. I needed to make sure it really was you. Do you think he would be calmly sitting in his office working if he knew you were here?‚Äù he smiled.

1km2te4,https://i.redd.it/af9nq1t7en0f1.jpeg,First post - Just finished first 10 day fast for autophagy (55F),"This is such an amazing, supportive community. I comment lots, but have never posted. I‚Äôve seen questions about what someone with a normal BMI range can expect so I decided to post my 10 day fast numbers. Started Friday, May 2 at 6pm (comparison above is Saturday, May 3 morning) Ended this morning. 10.5 day fast - water, black coffee, electrolytes and a bit of dill pickle brine some days (salt & potassium, 0 calories, but straightened out any electrolyte issues in 2 minutes)

I fast for autophagy. I‚Äôll gain 5-6lbs back in the next couple of days based on previous fasts. I did a longer fast this time for a random shoulder pain that wouldn‚Äôt go away and dementia prevention (some family history). The shoulder pain went away around day 8. Yay! I may never know about the dementia effects but the research says fasting helps so better than doing nothing.

I have done 3 & 5 day fasts over the last couple of years so I trained my body for this. It‚Äôs my first 10 day fast and first time I broke a fast before my body said it was ready. I was going to try 14 days but muscle loss hit the line between average and high on my scale 2 days in a row. Muscle is tough to gain in your 50‚Äôs. I‚Äôm not a fan of lifting weights but I will the next 2-3 weeks to take advantage of the HGH spike.

Lots of questions on wrinkles/skin sagging on here. Skin turnover takes 6+ weeks at my age but my nasal folds and starter level jowls actually got better. Probably from losing the facial fat filling them out. My skin does look better but that maybe because I have loads of time so finally doing proper skin care.

Refeed today had some false starts.

9:30am & 12pm had 3/4 cp broth. Stomach made a bit of a rumble but refused to get hungry or really start back up. I even forgot until noon I was refeeding today. My body was really liking that fast but losing more muscle than I wanted at my age.

2:30 & 4:30pm - 1 scrambled egg each time. Stomach grumbled and finally decided it was okay eating.

5:30 - after first egg my body was thinking meat & cheese (too soon). After second egg I saw a banana on the counter and my body was FIXATED on it. Like 3 yr old child fixation. I‚Äôve never had a banana on day 1 of refeed but seems like it would be gentle and it was all my body wanted. The potassium, maybe? Ate it slow over 30 minutes. Bit of stomach gurgling and I thought it‚Äôs going straight through me, but nope - my body fought hard for that banana and it was NOT letting it go. üòÇ

Doing a light workout tonight, certainly not enough calories to build muscle today, but my body has zero interest in more food. I‚Äôll probably eat 2 meals tomorrow introducing meats & veg (probably some cheese), I‚Äôm not really a breakfast person. It is nice to not have any sugar or junk food cravings.

Me and my girlfriend/wife have been together for nearly a year

I've made some mistakes and I regret them but I feel like what's happening isn't fair

When we meet I used tinder to find a friend we weren't daiting or anything at the time . I get it looks bad but I only look for a friend I've had enough for being told I wasn't.
Before I met her I followed and liked questionable things but I was told it would help me find followers but it didn't.
As for context I was SA in 2023 and ever since that day up untill I met her I had no sexual or romantic feelings they disappeared.
When I told her I was SA she said she's happy it happened later on she said she understands snd that we can talk . I thought this was finally sorted but later on kt was obvious she was still upset.
What she seems to do when she's upset is say the most hurtful things she can come up with .
When my brother passed she was here before me but before it happened she talked about how much she wished my mum little sister and brother died . She takes about how she wanted my abusive other person ""dad"" DK his age DC either have no memory of him and I'm happy I don't hes thr one who ruined my brother's life . Anyways she said I was like him that our blood is the same and that my mum 41f deserved to die . She knows he tried to drown her she knows he hit her Infront of my brother. He once tried to cut my out of my mum's stomach . Yet she still said and with detail how she wanted them all to die . This really hurt me but I knew or thought it was her pms and anxiety. She goes into a crisis and this is why it happens. When my brother passed she was here with me she helped me more them I could possibly ask for . She helped me message him before him before he passed which again meant more then anything to me . She helped me say goodbye to him which I broke down and couldn't function. My brother 22m may he rest in peace.
He had addiction problems and sadly passed away in February 14th. During his funeral she stopped talking untill it was over and explained she was going through her own grief and was upset I told her how I wouldn't be the same. Losing a sibling is hard very hard and I didn't know how to feel or do anything and hearing that hurt because ofc I wouldn't be the same but not in the way she thinks. I would be sad I could never hear him try to fix everything with me and him. I stoped talking to him up until February 4th. I messaged him and he replied I didn't respond I didn't know how to . As the days go by she talks about how useless he was and wanted to die he was nothing and had no future. Went through his tictkck and sent a photo of him and all the videos be liked. She oh look you did the same thing. She told me how disgusting he was and that he disrespected woman . He was smart he was kind he deserved a life free of his problems. I miss him .
Recently she did something I don't know how to react to . We had a disagreement and she went into what she said a meltdown. Shs gave me rules which I must follow and they are as follows
What 21m is allowed to do:
‚Ä¢ Read books (must show the book to 23f before reading ‚Äî no books may be read without her permission)
‚Ä¢ Use WhatsApp
‚Ä¢ Drink water
‚Ä¢ Perform everyday essentials like showering, brushing teeth, skincare, etc.

Daily Requirement:
Every day at 10am, 21m must get down on his knees and apologise to 23f and send her a video of this via WhatsApp.

Important: Always consult 23f before doing anything.


---

What 21m is not allowed to do:
‚Ä¢ Have any app on his phone apart from WhatsApp
‚Ä¢ Watch TV
‚Ä¢ Talk to women (exceptions: female family members, excluding cousins; women in 23f‚Äôs family are allowed)

Important Example: If 21m enters a coffee shop and the attendant is a woman, he must leave without making a purchase.
‚Ä¢ Keep any pictures of women in his gallery other than 23f (even if they are close relatives)
‚Ä¢ Look at any unknown women or former female colleagues/classmates ‚Äî if this happens accidentally, 21m must record a video of himself getting down on his knees and apologising.
‚Ä¢ Eat food made by a woman ‚Äî before buying food from a restaurant or fast food place, 21m must ask if the cook is male or female; if female, he may not eat the food.
‚Ä¢ Leave the house without 23f‚Äôs permission
‚Ä¢ Have female friends. Male friends are only allowed if 23f approves.
‚Ä¢ Go to the gym


---

Activities 21m must do (as of 10/05/2002):
‚Ä¢ Show all TikTok videos watched during the specified time, even if it takes hours
‚Ä¢ Show all TikTok comments made, without deleting anything (to preserve evidence)
‚Ä¢ Show all liked and reposted TikTok videos, with nothing deleted



I did everything she said . She also told me to cut my finger off or cut my genital or she would send my personal photos you should know what I mean here to my mum and say I'm a p**do . I refused but she made it look like she did by photo shopping it. I was on my bed with a knife shaking and crying I didn't know what to do I was scared upset and so afraid. She called me some kfnthe worst names that day made fun of me for having autism which I told her she's only one who knows this . I'm very good at hiding it. She spent hours telling me to do this and that I deserve pain I deserve to die I'm horrible I'm disgusting I'm worthless. She told me that I'm nothing and that if I love her do everything she says that I must obey her .
I don't understand how someone can be so sweet loving and caring yet says these things.
She  finds it funny how I react she would download apps and show me the people who send her messages then delete the app and then she would say sorry. That she wanted me to feel what she feels .

1km2s9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1km2s9k/27m4f_northern_connecticut/,27M4F Northern Connecticut," I hope this post finds you all well! I'm a 27 year old guy living in North Connecticut, and I‚Äôm here to put myself out there because I‚Äôm hoping to meet someone special. To give a little more about me, I thought I‚Äôd write a more detailed post because, honestly, I believe a good connection starts with honesty and openness. So here it goes!

A Bit About Me:
I‚Äôm Ryan Wendell, a cashier who‚Äôs been living in the area for 10 years Outside of work, I love watching anime and reading. In my downtime, you can often find me reading. I‚Äôm pretty easygoing and enjoy a mix of low-key nights in and spontaneous adventures out.

I value deep conversations, but I‚Äôm also a fan of silly moments and bad puns. Life‚Äôs too short to take everything seriously, right?

What I‚Äôm Looking For:
At the end of the day, I‚Äôm hoping to find someone who shares some of my values and interests, and most importantly, is looking for a genuine connection. I‚Äôm not rushing anything but would love to meet someone with the goal of eventually finding a long-term relationship.

I‚Äôm a firm believer in starting things off as friends ‚Äî so whether we meet for coffee or go on a hike, I‚Äôm open to building a connection that feels natural and comfortable. I‚Äôm looking for someone who‚Äôs kind, funny, and enjoys spending time with a down-to-earth person who doesn‚Äôt mind chatting about everything and anything.

Bonus points if you‚Äôre also into anime or books.

Why North Connecticut?
I live here because I love the mix of natural beauty and small-town charm, and I‚Äôve found so many cool places to explore. The forests, the lakes, the trails ‚Äî it all has a vibe that‚Äôs perfect for someone like me who loves a bit of everything. I‚Äôd love to find someone local, or someone who‚Äôs up for driving around this beautiful area together!

A Little About What I Value:
Communication: Open, honest communication is so important to me. If something‚Äôs on your mind, let‚Äôs talk about it.

Respect and Trust: These are foundational in any relationship. I respect boundaries and expect the same.

Mutual Interests: It‚Äôs nice to share things you love, but also fun to learn about each other‚Äôs passions.

A Sense of Humor: Life can be hard sometimes, and being able to laugh at the weird, awkward, and funny moments makes everything better.

If You‚Äôre Interested‚Ä¶
If this sounds like something you‚Äôre into, feel free to DM me! We can chat, exchange a few messages, and see if there‚Äôs a spark. I don‚Äôt mind taking things slow ‚Äî getting to know each other and seeing where things go. Whether it leads to a romantic connection or just a great friendship, I‚Äôm happy to make a new connection!

Also, if you're new to the area, I‚Äôm happy to recommend some local spots to check out or hang out with you in town.

Thanks for reading, and I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing from you! üòÑ
