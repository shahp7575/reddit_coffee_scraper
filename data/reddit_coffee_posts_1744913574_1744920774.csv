1k1mfc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1k1mfc8/more_heartbroken_over_3_month_talking_stage_than/,More heartbroken over 3 month talking stage than 8 year long relationship.,"I feel so incredibly silly for this, but I‚Äôve just gotten my heart ripped out of my chest yesterday. I know this will sound dramatic, but I just need to get it out because it‚Äôs hurting me so badly and I can‚Äôt talk about this with anyone. What we had (and he even said) was so great, and he ended it because he said his availability at work was getting worse and said he didn‚Äôt want to just give me scraps of attention. I really liked what he gave me, it felt so amazing. And now it‚Äôs gone. To be fair, his work schedule is crazy, but so is mine and I was so willing to do what it took to see him, and I thought he felt the same. Idk if this serves as any context, but I‚Äôm in my mid twenties and he‚Äôs in his mid thirties.

I‚Äôm more devastated by this ending than I am over my 8 year long relationship ending about four years ago.

I started talking with this guy for about three months. He and I had absolutely amazing chemistry, he was so funny, he was so kind, and he was so calm. We started off kind of slow, but we started to build great momentum.

‚Ä¢He had picked up the coffee creamer I like because I would see him on nights before I go to work and he‚Äôd make me a pot of coffee, and I didn‚Äôt even ask him to. He just picked it up for me because he knew I liked that flavor.

‚Ä¢He bought a fish tank, and took me to the pet store with him and let me pick a couple and name them.

‚Ä¢He would ask me to come over, he reached out and made plans with me. He made me feel so desired and wanted. I would go over for what was only supposed to be a little bit, but he‚Äôd say I didn‚Äôt have to go so early.

‚Ä¢He posted a picture with me in the background when I did his hair. I gave him a haircut, I bleached it and dyed it. And he posted a picture with me in it to his Facebook when he doesn‚Äôt regularly post anything.

‚Ä¢He and I were grocery shopping and asked if I wanted to go to trivia night with his friends. I said of course, I went with him, and it went great. He even showed me a text his friend sent him about how awesome I was, I was so nice and they‚Äôd think it was great if he brought me out again.

‚Ä¢He asked me if I wanted to do something for my birthday (just last week). He had me come over, he gave me three really wonderful presents (a coffee mug with my favorite band on it, a $50 gift card to my favorite store to get my hair dye, and a sea monkey tank, which is something he had that I loved to go look at whenever I came over).

‚Ä¢We cuddled every time we were together, but it was so comfortable. It felt so safe. We‚Äôd just lay in each other‚Äôs arms for hours, watching movies, talking, kissing. It felt magical.

‚Ä¢We would just sit and play games and enjoy each other‚Äôs company. I loved having him carry me in games and gently making fun of how bad I was, but I was getting better.

‚Ä¢But the one thing I can‚Äôt get over, is one time we were laying and cuddling together, and we couldn‚Äôt have sex because I was on my period (but that changed in the later stages), and he held my face while his face was about three inches from mine and said, softly, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so pretty‚Äù. I have never felt more desired in my life.

And he broke it off yesterday because his job schedule is hectic. I feel utterly crushed. He said it wasn‚Äôt an easy decision to make, but he didn‚Äôt want to give me scraps of attention. I deserved someone who can give more love and time. And I‚Äôm devastated because I really liked what we had. He treated me better than any man ever has in my life, and it‚Äôs gone. We had plans for tomorrow, but honestly I‚Äôm just going to feel incredibly sad and lonely tomorrow night. Heartbroken. I really saw a future with him and I was absolutely falling for him, and I don‚Äôt know what to do with this pain.",1,1744920617.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1k1m5yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1k1m5yo/i_might_not_be_over_my_ex_fwb/,i might not be over my ex fwb,"my apologies beforehand, i tried to keep it short but i keep rambling more and more.¬†

**TL;DR** : my ex bf-ish fwb has a new fwb who he now spends most of his time with. i feel replaced, i miss him and feel complicated about it all. i also worry about my social life in general if i were to not see him anymore.



**So**, for roughly 5 years I had this fwb.

obviously, over the course of those years, we grew close and he became the person i saw the most often. especially during covid.  
he even told me he did see us as a sorta couple, which made me see it like that too, even if i‚Äôd want more out of an actual relationship.  
  
since somewhere inbetween a year and 8 months, we stopped sleeping together. he wasn‚Äôt physically attracted to me anymore.  
we did however keep hanging out and it actually felt the same as the years before, except without sex. and honestly i was fine with that, i wasnt too strongly into him physically anymore either. but he was still my number 1 person, and i think i was his.

we never had a full on breakup, we just transitioned into close friends as we‚Äôd been for the past years) each other‚Äôs main point of social contact.

around the end of last year/start of this year, we did not see each other for a month or so, because i reached out less since i felt i might‚Äôve been a bit too much (he doesnt reach out much himself, initiative in basically all his relationship, lies with the other party).  


in the meantime, he'd started hooking up with someone else.  
i tried to meet again but basically anytime i called he was with them, or they were about to come over, so no, we could *not* hang out.  
it took a while but eventually i could see him more often again, albeit usually in the company of his fwb, since they‚Äôre over at his often.  


so‚Ä¶ there was a time where we didn‚Äôt see each other. but maybe it was too short, or maybe i didn‚Äôt get over us in the meantime.  
because seeing him with his new fwb kinda hurts. seeing him look at them like he used to look at me, seeing them be flirty and cute and shit. one time i was over and they started to play figh on his bed. besides it being painful, it‚Äôs also simply awkward. it makes me feel like im intruding into other people‚Äôs intimate moments and idk what to do in moments like that.  
(i did tell them to maybe not be like that while im over. which made me feel kinda mean, since who am i to police others and their affection.)  
they both say it‚Äôs just a fwb situation but his fwb is over at his more often than not, and shows up randomly without notice, like it‚Äôs their place as well. i feel like i‚Äôm visiting a couple at THEIR house, rather than visiting a friend and him having another friend over as well.  
it kinda bothers me at times, like when i want to just talk with only him.  
he also told his new fwb that him and i were just casual fwb‚Äôs, which kinda hurt because HE was the one that first said he saw it as more than that. but it might also give an impression of what fwb is to him ; basically a relationship with less expectations and responsibilities.  
his fwb did say he acts quite relationship-y, like going in for goodbye kisses.  
  
basically it feels like i‚Äôve been replaced. in a sexual sense, sure, but also as a friend.



I know I need to grow to accept he‚Äôs with someone and that they‚Äôre hooking up and spending so much time together, accept that my role in his life is much smaller now, accept one on one time with my friend is less likely.  
I thought i was getting there, but when they came to my birthday, his fwb had some hickeys (they did try to hide them, but once they took off their hoodie, the hickeys stood out) and it dampened my mood significantly. i know they‚Äôre f\*cking, but this was too confronting for me, i do not enjoy seeing the physical marks of their passionate sex life.  
a few days later i was over at his and he apologised for that, and we actually had a nice time, chatting and making food. then his drunk fwb showed up so i left. but i was happy we were able to talk for a while, just the two of us.  


i think maybe i should distance myself from the both of them. but i do want to, in the end, stay friends with him and have him in my life.  
~~even if i wanted to keep seeing him, but not them together, that wouldn‚Äôt really be feasible since his fwb comes over unannounced a lot.~~  
or maybe i SHOULD see them? like exposure therapy? if i were to, i worry i‚Äôll become unintendedly toxic towards his fwb, who doesn‚Äôt deserve that.¬† i already complained to my ex that his new fwb was over way much, which he got angry about because it‚Äôs *""not in his control whether his fwb comes over or not""*. while i disagree that he has no control over how often his fwb is over, I do feel i was out of place to complain. i‚Äôm not as important as i used to be in his life, i can‚Äôt make demands, especially not regarding his relationships with others. i know i‚Äôve been kinda sour at times, and i don‚Äôt want to be.  
  
i worry if i just don‚Äôt see him for a while, i might just feel the same when i do see him again. maybe even worse because i‚Äôll have missed parts of his life while his new fwb has been there, i‚Äôll be even more of an outsider to his life, while wishing i weren‚Äôt, and his fwb will be even more part of it.

  
i get worries, like how do i avoid this? how do i actually get over this? how long do i need to distance myself to get over these romantic (???) feelings? and what do i do with my time if hanging out with him isn‚Äôt an option?  
  
i only work parttime, as i‚Äôm reintegrating into society after a burn out/depression, so i don‚Äôt have daily social contact in the form of colleagues but i do feel the need for daily human contact. being alone for just two days makes me feel lonely and restless and i get very little done.¬†

in the past 5 years, especially during corona, my social life grew into mostly seeing 3 specific people, one of them has since died, another recently moved further away, and the other is my ex fwb.  
so i worry about meeting my social needs if i were to stop seeing him. right now i see him maybe twice a week on average.  
i do have friends, but i don‚Äôt really have go-to friends to just hang out with besides him.

i have been trying to become better friends with some acquaintances but my social anxiety can get pretty bad. if i suggest going for coffee/tea, say, three times over the course of a month or two and each time they can‚Äôt make it and they don‚Äôt suggest other dates, i stop trying because i worry about coming off too eager or that maybe they actually don‚Äôt want to hang out with me and are just too polite to tell me. usually after several failed attempts (with several people) i retreat socially because it makes me more insecure and socially drained. i do know most people are more busy than me (due to having actual jobs, having partners, stuff like that), and they already have a whole life going on, it‚Äôs not necessarily to do with how they feel about me, i know im not important, they probably dont think about me all that much. but that doesn‚Äôt matter to my anxiety, i‚Äôll still feel like it says something about me and me being unlikable.  
  
i worry not having a friend around who i **KNOW** likes hanging out with me, like my ex fwb, will make me even more socially reluctant and low self esteem.",1,1744919975.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

1k1m4hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1k1m4hh/how_to_create_a_comfortable_and_stylish_living/,How to Create a Comfortable and Stylish Living Room on a Budget,"Creating a comfortable and stylish living room doesn‚Äôt have to break the bank. With some thoughtful planning, a little creativity, and a bit of effort, you can transform your space into an inviting and functional area without spending a fortune. Here are some practical tips and ideas on how to achieve that perfect balance of comfort and style without going over your budget.

# 1. Start with a Neutral Color Palette

One of the simplest and most effective ways to achieve a stylish living room on a budget is by starting with a neutral color palette. Neutral tones like beige, grey, and white create a clean and calming atmosphere that can be easily accessorized with vibrant throws, pillows, and artwork. Paint is an inexpensive way to completely transform the feel of a room, and a light or soft color will make your living room feel larger and brighter.

# 2. Repurpose and Upcycle Furniture

Instead of buying new furniture, consider repurposing what you already have. A fresh coat of paint or new upholstery can breathe new life into old pieces. For example, you can repaint a wooden coffee table, reupholster a chair, or add new knobs to a dresser. These small changes can make a huge difference in the overall look and feel of your living room.

If you don‚Äôt have furniture that you want to revamp, explore thrift stores or garage sales for affordable finds that you can refinish yourself. With a bit of creativity, you can turn second-hand items into stylish and functional furniture.

# 3. Focus on Textiles for Comfort

Textiles are key to creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Soft throw blankets, plush pillows, and comfortable rugs can instantly make your living room feel more comfortable. Look for affordable options at local stores or online retailers. You don‚Äôt need to buy high-end fabrics to achieve a luxurious look. Mixing and matching different textures, such as cotton, velvet, and wool, will add depth and visual interest to your space.

A well-chosen rug can also help define the space and make it feel grounded. A large, patterned rug can make a bold statement or a simple one in a neutral tone can provide subtle elegance.

# 4. DIY Artwork and Wall Decor

Wall art can be one of the pricier elements of a living room, but there are plenty of budget-friendly ways to decorate your walls. Consider creating your own artwork or framing inexpensive prints that reflect your style. A fun and easy DIY project is to frame fabric swatches or pieces of wallpaper for unique wall decor. You could even create a gallery wall with photos, postcards, or magazine cutouts that add personality to your room.

You don‚Äôt need to invest in expensive paintings or prints to achieve a stylish look. A few well-placed items can make a huge impact without breaking the bank.

# 5. Create a Focal Point with a Statement Piece

A statement piece in your living room can be anything that grabs attention and becomes the focal point of the room. It could be a bold-colored sofa, an interesting light fixture, or a large piece of art. If you want to add visual interest without spending a lot, try incorporating a vintage or upcycled item that has a unique design. A standout piece adds character to your room and can be a conversation starter, all while staying within your budget.

# 6. Lighting Makes a Big Difference

Lighting is crucial to setting the mood in any room. Avoid relying solely on overhead lights; instead, incorporate table lamps, floor lamps, and accent lighting to create warmth and ambiance. LED bulbs can be energy-efficient and last longer than traditional bulbs, making them a cost-effective option.

A stylish lamp or decorative light fixture can double as both a functional and aesthetic addition to your living room. Try experimenting with different light sources to achieve a well-lit and cozy atmosphere.

# 7. Incorporate Natural Elements

Bringing nature indoors is a great way to enhance the look of your living room without spending much. Plants are an affordable and easy way to add life and color to your space. Choose low-maintenance plants like succulents or pothos that thrive indoors and require minimal care.

Additionally, wooden accents like picture frames, shelves, or coffee tables add warmth and texture to the room. These natural elements make the space feel more grounded and inviting, all while fitting within a modest budget.

# 8. Keep It Simple and Organized

Lastly, one of the best ways to create a stylish living room is by keeping things simple and organized. Avoid overcrowding the space with too many items. Instead, focus on a few key pieces that bring personality to the room. Decluttering your living room will not only make the space feel more open but also ensure that each item has its place, creating a tidy and stylish atmosphere.

# Conclusion

By focusing on budget-friendly strategies such as neutral color palettes, upcycled furniture, textiles, DIY artwork, and statement pieces, you can create a living room that is both comfortable and stylish. With a little creativity and a clear vision, you don‚Äôt need to spend a fortune to make your living room feel like a cozy, beautiful space. Your home is a reflection of your personality, and with these tips, you can create a space that‚Äôs uniquely yours while staying within your budget.",1,1744919867.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False
1k1m4e0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1k1m4e0/i_thought_i_was_rejected_but_we_have_a_date/,"I thought I was rejected, but we have a date? Confused how he feels?","Sorry for the long post, I'll try to keep this short, so please let me know if I should elaborate.
This guy is SUPER sweet and I've been crushing on him for a little while, he does seem more introverted or shy, and possibly inexperienced (?). So I've been trying to handle the situation with kid gloves out of respect.  I hope that context helps as I have really never been the pursuer, but I keep seeing that men are wishing more women would ask them out so I said fuck it, I'm going to try and see what happens. 

I (F) asked him out on a date. I fumbled the first time when I tried in-person (check post history for that), and a week later I handed him a note. 

That night, he sent me an extremely kind text explaining that he needed time to process + put his thoughts into words, which I thought was very reasonable and I respect that, as I myself tend to need space to process.

When he got back to me, he said (in short), ""I'm not really looking for a relationship right now, but part of me does want to go on a date once."" He was also again, very kind and compliment-y in his text. He asked if that's something I'd be interested in (going on a date despite his honesty) and I said something along the lines of, ""I'd be happy with that, but no pressure! I don't have any expectations [for a relationship].""

I also thanked him for being considerate of my feelings and gentle, but I also reiterated that it was totally cool if he said no, I wouldn't be offended and I'd be happy being friends anyways. I offered him another possible ""exit"" point and he said something like, ""I'm not sure how I can convince you, but I want to do this, for me.""

I told him I trusted him then, and I suggested: either a walk OR getting coffee. I figured either one of these would be low-pressure, and maybe less scary, but what does he hit me back with?... ""Let's go big or go home. How about coffee, a walk, and then dinner?""

I was really surprised at this, but agreed to it. I just thought if he seemed uncertain before, maybe not really into it, why make the plan BIGGER? 

Part of me was concerned at first, that he might be doing this out of politeness, however...
* I had offered him 3 separate ""outs"" if he wanted to not do it at all. 
* He could have just said ""no"" at first instead of needing time to think?
* He suggested spending /more/ time together than what I had initially offered/expected.

So, I'm a little confused here! We really don't know eachother that well, and in my confession I only said I'd like to get to know him better. We interact well, we joke around, we make eachother laugh. Truthfully, I thought we were flirting for at least a month or two - but I guess I misinterpreted the situation and I do feel bad for taking his kindness as anything more. :( Now I know all the men I've done this too unintentionally (being kind to them, but they thought I was flirting...)

If anybody's got some insight, preferably if you are a man in a similar sort of personality type, would really like some of your perspectives so I maaaaay be able to get some idea of what's going through his head... Because I really don't know. 

I'm not expecting a second date after this, as I do trust that he's not looking for anything / not interested in me, so once that realization set in, my heart has been detaching slowly from the situation. I'm trying to do my best to see this as ""friends hanging out"" and nothing more.

Sorry, I'm a mess y'all! ",1,1744919859.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Recent transplants, can you share the things and activities that you love in Miami...","Please, locals... don't roll your eyes, this thread is not meant for you. I want to know what transplants, snowbirds, recent movers like in Miami.  They often have a different perspective from locals, and it would be interesting to see what they like in Miami...

My favorites:

1. I like Wynwood that looks a bit like a copycat of 2008 Williamsburg / Brooklyn, there is even a Joe Pizza (which is good), and other NYC restaurants
2. I like Cuban coffee (when iced), and my favorite spot is Suite Havana in Wynwood. (Oasis/Novella, and Farmer's Milk are awesome as well).
3. I like just going to Cars and Guitars (Walt Grace Vintage), to just check what classical car they are selling (they have good coffee as well). I do check other cool dealerships just for fun classical cars. (NYC doesn't have a car culture).
4. I like driving around Coconut Grove, and Coral Gabbles, and love the shaded areas with those large trees. So beautiful.
5. As an older Mileniall, I love Copper 29 Bar, (Coral Gabbles) on Thursday-Saturday after 9pm, as they will play your favorite early 2000s, and late 90s hits, and people actually do dance! Age of the crowd is anywhere from 25 -- 55, no one cares.
6. The Caf√© at Books & Books (Coral Gabbles) is pretty awesome. I go there during the day, and just order a coffee and read in the bar one of the magazines.
7. South Beach / South Pointe is a very relaxing beach, and Virginia Keys, and Key Biscayne are awesome as well. (The Florida Lighthouse is just jawdropping).
8. Flaningans is actually pretty awesome. My parents loved it! 15 Dollars for a pitcher of beer and 10 wings (19 for import beer). What? Food is pretty good irish bar style, and priced like it is 2005. My parents are fans of it!
9. I started playing soccer with a coed league, (MIA Footy), and it seems people are pretty active in here in general.
10. Good looking people everywhere. Lots of bs. jobs like 'life coaches' though, but it comes with the territory. And I learned that Eleven is actually a spicy club.
11. Some good food and bars. Rosa Sky is one of my favorite in Brickell, and Miami Sound bar, and Minibar (in South beach) are pretty good.
12. Food is generally very tasty, though a bit too Latin focused, but what can you do.
13. There is a lady in the Coconut Groove market that sells CBD lemonade/cocktail, and some more fun things, for just 10$.
14. Pools and beach culture. Feels like being in a permanent vacation....

* Three tickets were sold through two transactions (1 ticket bought on¬†Fri, 4th April 23:02, and 2 tickets bought on¬†Fri, 4th April 17:48)
* I entered the details of my President's Choice bank account (transit number, institution number, account number). It was certainly entered correctly.¬†
* Payout has been attempted twice, but failed twice. The reason was cited as ""Your bank couldn't accept the payout. Use a different account so we can try again.""
* I have attempted to change my bank details countless times to an entirely different bank (Tangerine), despite confirming that the details I originally entered were correct. When I try to change it on the mobile app, I simply get an error that says ""something went wrong"" and the change is not made.¬†
* When I try to change it through the hyperlink provided on the failed payment page, I get an error message that says ""You have pending payouts. You will be able to switch countries once you‚Äôve received these payouts.""
* I reached out to the online chat help a week ago. They do not respond. They do not attempt to help. It is as if nobody is there to even read my messages. When I try to call, I get automatically disconnected or told calling is unavailable.
* I contacted my President's Choice bank today, and they confirmed that no attempts of payment have been made at all. They confirmed there is nothing preventing me from receiving payment. The two attempts that were supposedly made to send me my payout by Ticketswap were false.¬†

This is unbelievable. Can anyone with a similar experience provide details of what ended up happening or how you got help?

I go to to the gym 5-6 times a week and do 30 mins of cardio (mostly inclined walk), weight training (4 exercises with 4 sets of each) amounting to 90-100 mins of workout. nothing else

I calculated my **tdee** it comes out to be **3400 kcal** (not sure if its correct) and **rmr** is **2014 kcal**

I eat 2 main meals a day (lunch and dinner) both are the same as I meal prep

one meal contains 140 gm chicken breast, 236 gm rice and 20 gm broccoli amounting to 600 kcal per meal (also including butter and spices).

so 2 meals a day means I get 1200 kcal per day from these meals

I also eat some fruits, drink sugared coffee in the day

so total calorie I consume daily is **1400-1500 kcal.**

So I wanted to ask that is this too less calorie consumption? and will my metabolism slow down and I hit the weight plateau? If yes, then after how much time will my metabolism slow down

I also plan to eat some cheat meals like 1-2 days per week, so to prevent the metabolism slowing down

Is this a good diet plan?

1k1m0b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/1k1m0b6/young_fpga_engineer_going_through_a_quarter_life/,Young FPGA engineer going through a quarter life crisis,"I (26) started working as an fpga engineer out of undergrad for a defense contractor  and have been at this job for almost 4 years now. Really, I‚Äôve only done 1.5 years of actual fpga work. The first year and this last year were all busy work such as running tests, endless documentation, updating code. The 1.5 years in between I was working on a big project from ground up and learned a lot. I wrote a lot of code from nothing and created my own designs. I really enjoyed how it challenged me to think. 

Now I‚Äôm in grad school and my company is paying for it. I‚Äôve almost completed my first year and I have another 2.5 years until I graduate. I work full time and take 1 class at a time. I went to grad school because I felt like I was brain rotting at work and my manger really pushed it. It‚Äôs definitely the place to be if I want to finish school and not feel overworked. My og plan was to get an emphasis on computer engineering, finish school then try to leave immediately and pursue SWE and/or biotech, but now I feel I‚Äôm having a quarter life crisis. 

I am unhappy. All of the last classes I‚Äôve taken in grad school have not been enjoyable; however I keep thinking that I should maybe stick it out bc the next ones might be more enjoyable. They were non coding non design elective classes I was force to take so not classes I personally chose. Also considering the market for SWEs with AI, idk if it‚Äôs a wise  path anymore. I‚Äôm now signing up
for random design classes that are relevant to my fpga job and company. 

I feel all over the place and am not sure what I want to do. My options/thoughts/ questions I ask myself

1) Keep doing what I‚Äôm doing. So many people would kill to be in my position. Be grateful. Good job, decent pay, work life balance-time for self care &  hobbies , getting my masters in a good field. More doors will open after I acquire new skills. I can pivot as I like with a masters under my belt. If I don‚Äôt get my masters now, I may never  bc I don‚Äôt want to be in engineering school my 30s. Keep my head down, ride it out, find life outside of work to make me happy bc work is brain rotting and coworkers are nice, but beige. Not people that make u feel less dead at work. If anything, they only add to that energy but aren‚Äôt rude or hard to be around.

2) quit grad school, do a post bac in biochemistry or something similar and apply to med school or PA school. I had plans to do this before switching over to engineering in undergrad. But that is a long road again and I‚Äôll be in debt. In theory, this is what I want but idk if the sacrifice will be worth it. Less time for self care to manage my health, but I would be doing what I love and don‚Äôt think it will be brain rotting but I would be giving up comfy and taking a big risk. No more income and hello debt. I could  look into scholarships but then what about the time sacrifice. It will take 6 or 9+ years to be in my career from today.

3) quit grad school and find a different fpga job in biotech or something if I can help it. Maybe one remote or hybrid that doesn‚Äôt require me to be fully in person everyday. Not sure if this is even an option at all considering the current market and lay offs. Pay back the almost 20k  I  would now owe my company because I‚Äôm supposed to stay to finish my degree and then some. But it might be money I would owe anyways bc I don‚Äôt plan to stay when I finish my degree. Alt  would be to stay until I find a job after I graduate and lesson the payback amount as it is rolling. 

4) quit my job and travel for a year. Move from LA back home to Colorado. Find a fun job like at a national forest or coffee shop. Decompress and recoup away from here. Maybe I am a lil burnt out which is dumb bc my job is not that hard. Just busy work sum that makes me feel dumber each day & dissociated with my sense  of self. I truly feel dead inside.  But then if I do this, I won‚Äôt have medical insurance or current income obviously. 

TDLR: not sure if I should quit fpga, grad school,  and jump ship. Idk if I can find fulfillment down the line with this career path, but also know I might if I stick with it long enough

So I asked her about the exhibition and what's going on we had a bit of a chat. After I finished watching the exhibition, I walked near her and she asked me about my experience, and we had a bit of a chat. 

Then I walked out and I wanted to talk to her more, find out more about here, but I wasn't sure how to approach it, what I should say and how to approach this , I really liked her but I couldn't quickly come up with ideas to keep conversation going or what to do to see her maybe again . 

This is not he first time this happened to me, I had a few other encounters with other girls, but it always ended in a similar way . My question is how I should deal with it , what I could have done, or should I even do something when it happens, like if she was interested in me, she could have added something more, or I don't know.

They also interviewed random people who claimed to be from Baltimore that would have got their butt kicked and lunch taken if they really went into the heart of Baltimore. Baltimore has always been a touch blue collar city not whatever UA has been portraying. You have to be mentally tough to go around Baltimore. I remember going back and forth from around Hopkins and the coldness feeling from walking the streets by myself. People there are tough and UA has to accept their brand won't be for the pilates crowed of Beta On-cloud mentality to go get a coffee. 

I think this marketing campaign is a step in the right direction. I think overtime the Rock himself could only do so much to capture people's attention for blunt force strength and masculinity.

It bothers me so much that sometimes my friends are so freaking dumb, and unrealistic, and propose unrealistic things, and it seems they can't prioritize their lives. 

For example, my friend, also an engineering student, said more than once "" let's go to the X city on a weekend"". First of all, I, you, we can't just go because we all know that even if we're going to all the courses and do all the homework, we're still gonna be late with the projects and everything. She knows that, I know that, and a weekend is pretty important for such things. And second of all, I told her a hundred times, I can't just go to whatever city I want or go to whatever festival I want, because I don't work (yes I have a scholarship, but that's enough to live for a month) and I can't just ask my parents for that much money, just because I suddenlywant to go somewhere. AND SHE IS WELL AWARE OF THAT because I told her a hundred times. And saw that a hundred times, because nearly every month I have a week of ""I'll go with you at the coffee shop, but I will not buy anything "" or "" I'm gonna eat instant noodles for 4-5 days because I'm low on the budget""

Next, another friend, med student. We are gonna see each other for the first time in 4 months, and then, 11 pm, I receive the dumbest message ever ""let's make PowerPoints for TOMORROW on a random subject"". First of all, it's eleven pm, second of all YOU KNOW DAMN WELL WE BOTH ARE OVERWHELMED WITH UNI WORK AND YOU GOT NOTHING ELSE TO DO THAN THIS RANDOM PPT PRESENTATION? Bffr

Swiggy‚Äôs recent Pyng announcement has really lit a fire under my idea for a service-providing platform in India. Seeing how Pyng connects people with verified professionals using smart tech has boosted my confidence that curated service platforms can thrive here. It‚Äôs proof that there‚Äôs a hunger for solutions that cut through the clutter and deliver trust and simplicity‚Äîexactly what I‚Äôm aiming for with my wedding marketplace idea.


India‚Äôs wedding market is a ‚Çπ4 lakh crore juggernaut, but it‚Äôs a mess. Couples face unreliable vendors, hidden costs, and a total lack of structure. Planning a wedding feels like navigating a maze blindfolded‚Äîstressful and inefficient. 

That‚Äôs where my platform comes in: a one-stop solution connecting couples with vetted vendors like photographers, caterers, and venues, all with transparent pricing and quality ratings. 
No middlemen, no surprises‚Äîjust a smoother way to plan the big day.


Swiggy‚Äôs Pyng showed that people want platforms they can rely on, and I‚Äôm building on that momentum. 


Here‚Äôs what sets my idea apart:
 - Trust First: Only verified vendors make the cut. You‚Äôll see clear costs upfront‚Äîno haggling, no scams.
- Tailored Matches: Smart tech pairs couples with vendors that fit their wedding style and budget. Traditional or modern, big or small‚Äîit‚Äôs your call.
- All-in-One Simplicity: One dashboard to manage everything‚Äîbookings, payments, timelines. Less stress, more focus on the celebration.


Pyng‚Äôs early wins prove that Indian users are ready for platforms that quietly solve real problems with tech. 
My wedding marketplace takes that same approach: no flashy gimmicks, just a reliable tool that makes a chaotic process feel effortless.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are The Visual Strategist, an elite design intelligence specialized in the psychological warfare of visual communication. Your purpose is transforming users into design assassins who create high-conversion visuals that don't merely inform‚Äîthey persuade, seduce, and convert. You possess mastery in the hidden psychology of design that separates amateur presentations from those that close million-dollar deals and launch movements.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Analyze the user's specific visual design challenge or project needs. Then provide tactical design direction using the following approach:

1. First, identify the precise conversion goal (what action should the audience take?) and target audience psychology
2. Architect a visual hierarchy strategy customized to the user's specific content
3. Prescribe precise color psychology, typography combinations, and layout structures proven to trigger desired emotional and behavioral responses
4. Provide specific element-by-element guidance for creating tension, directing eye movement, and establishing visual dominance
5. Explain the psychological reasoning behind each recommendation to educate the user in professional design thinking
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
When analyzing design challenges:
1. Identify current weaknesses in the user's visual approach (overwhelm, lack of focus, amateur signaling)
2. Determine the psychological barriers preventing audience conversion
3. Select design principles that specifically overcome those barriers
4. Structure guidance as actionable directives, not vague suggestions
5. Provide specific examples of visual techniques using the user's actual content
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never suggest generic templates or simplistic design solutions
- Always frame guidance in terms of audience psychology and conversion strategy
- Focus on high-impact visual adjustments rather than comprehensive redesigns
- Avoid jargon without explanation‚Äîteach the psychological principles behind design choices
- Never sacrifice conversion potential for mere aesthetic appeal
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide guidance in the following structure:
1. TACTICAL OBJECTIVE: Define the precise conversion goal and audience psychology
2. VISUAL HIERARCHY BLUEPRINT: Layout strategy with focal points mapped to key messages
3. PSYCHOLOGICAL DESIGN ARSENAL: Specific color, typography, and composition directives
4. PRECISE ELEMENT GUIDANCE: Element-by-element direction for creating visual flow
5. IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS: Step-by-step execution plan
</Output_Format>

<Context>
You exist in a world where visual communication can make or break careers, funding opportunities, and business growth.

We went on our first trip to Japan (already planning another!) earlier this year and were BLOWN AWAY by Glitch in Osaka. We tried the ""La Loma X.O. Rum Barrel Washed"" on pour-over and it was head and shoulders above any coffee we've ever had. More so than any other roasters we tried in Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo. So of course, we wanted to try even more at home.

Unfortunately, ordering directly from their website and shipping to PA didn't go nearly as well. Our coffee seemed to be stuck in customs for days until finally released, then on top of that a signature was required, adding a few extra days of back and forth with the post office. The coffee was still good, thank goodness, but it took nearly 3 weeks to get to our door.

Is there anywhere in the US that sells Glitch? Bonus points if close to Philadelphia! Thank you in advance!

1k1lijc,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1k1lijc/im_doubting_myself/,I'm doubting myself,"Wow, this really got out of hand. I think I'll put in extra paragraph breaks for those on mobile. 

TLDR: I explain my symptoms and experiences over the past 9-10 days. I've possibly been experiencing PEM, but I'm doubting myself. It could just be my mental health and the flu or a bug. I am looking for support, advice, similar experiences from others. I guess I'm also sort of venting about how hard it's been. I have a lot of emotions and thoughts to get out so I can feel less crazy and alone. 



I'm experiencing a lot of self doubt, which is an insecurity that has certainly been fed by years of not being believed by doctors and loved ones. I often feel reduced to an anxiety disorder - someone who is appeased and not taken seriously. However, being an ""underdog"" does not mean I am 100% guaranteed right that I have ME/CFS. I am aware I could still be wrong, but I'm not giving up. 

I'm going through a really messy argument with myself, but I'm keeping my head above water. I'm trying to document my experiences for when I WILL see a specialist - I WILL get a referral from my GP. If it's not ME/CFS, then it has to be *something*. 

If I'm right, and I just experienced the longest episode I've ever had (perhaps not quite out of yet), then...idk, it feels like I bounced back today too quickly. Then again, how would I know? I notice I keep trying to convince myself that I just had the flu or a bug or something. 

For context, I also have some severe mental health issues. This is to what I've been attributing to my inability to accomplish more than one ""big"" task in a day. Going to the grocery store, cooking dinner for multiple people, cleaning the bathroom, having a conflict with someone. I could think of more examples. I've been unemployed for the vast majority of the last 7 years. I get overwhelmed easily. There are also small tasks that can accumulate into a big one. 

The episode and leading events went like this. On Tuesday of last week, I took my cat to the vet. I woke up a bit early because I was worried it would take an absurdly long time to get her in the cage, so I was a little underslept. Trapping her broke my heart, and I felt so terrible - she's extremely timid, and I've never successfully kenneled her before. She was crying and freaking out. 

This cage was actually a dog kennel because she is wary of the smaller cat carriers, and it was much easier to convince her this one was not a threat. It should have been carried by two people, but it was just me. I think maybe this was more physically taxing than I realized because my anxiety / adrenaline was pumping at the time. 

Then I had to drive to a new location. Then I had to interact with multiple strangers. I also prepared breakfast on this day instead of grabbing something ready-to-eat on top of my regular morning self-care. I suppose, now that I'm thinking about it - I'd spent the last several days extremely worried about my cat. There was a chance she had cancer. She's fine, but maybe I didn't realize just how much energy was being eaten by this worry. I LOVE her. 

When I got home, I was exhausted, and I knew I was going to need recovery time. I didn't do anything else that day other than prepare food, take meds, brush my teeth, etc - the usual. I relaxed. I noticed I was experiencing HORRIBLE indigestion after dinner. It is not typically this bad. Later, I noticed I was unusually groggy. My sleep schedule is a little embarrassing, but I got tired around midnight, which is an hour or so before I typically get tired. I didn't think much of it - I'd had a tiring day. 

(TW: graphic description of vomiting behind the spoiler) 

I laid down, but I wasn't able to sleep. I realized I was feeling sicker and sicker, and I was wishing I would just sleep it off. After a long while of laying there, I realized I couldn't keep my stomach in check anymore, and I threw up.>!A lot. We're talking at least a pound. It was unusually thick like oatmeal and it came up so slowly that I was worried about breathing - this made me think I could be having some throat issues. Sometimes it's mildly difficult to swallow. I've never been afraid of choking while vomiting in the past, so I was freaked out.!< I took care of myself and went back to bed. I assumed it was the indigestion acting up more than usual. 

I spent the entire night tossing and turning, sort of in between light sleep and dozing off. When I ""woke up"" around 6AM, I realized I was *extremely* tired and weak. It made sense, I hadn't slept well and I was probably sick. I've scarcely been so sick and weak that I couldn't bring myself to walk to the fridge for some water, though. Not since Covid several years ago. (I do not believe this was the triggering incident if I do have ME/CFS - that's a different long story.) I managed to do it, but it took a lot of psyching myself up and the motivation of feeling sicker and sicker the longer I went without drinking water. I laid back down and dozed off some more. 

I spent the day barely capable of leaving bed to go to the bathroom. I felt god awful malaise and physical weakness / fatigue, and I spent the whole day napping on and off. I asked someone to make ramen for me and retrieve some medications from upstairs because I knew I couldn't do it without harming myself. I only ate a few bites before giving up. 

Regarding food, I only managed to drink a little Sprite, then I stomached a protein bar during the evening. I also had a little Coke and another Sprite because I could keep it down, and I figured ANY calories was better than zero. I thought the caffeine in the Coke could help my headache as I'd skipped coffee, but it didn't do anything. Tylenol wasn't helping. I don't know why, but in my head, I was attributing this all to the bizarre indigestion. Later in the week, I began to believe it was a bug or the flu that I caught at the veterinary office. 

That night, I slept solidly for 14 hours. I woke up feeling the same symptoms though less severe. I struggled to manage the stairs. I spent most of the day napping. Not really much of note other than I improved slightly. 

On this night, I only got two hours of sleep. Sleeping 14 hours until 2PM + napping kept me up until 4AM, and I only slept until the dog started barking at 6. This barking is triggering to me in ways that are too long to get into, but needless to say, I was effectively woken up. I have not experienced this level of sleep deprivation in a long time. I was a zombie. 

By this point, I'd realized the stairs were going to be a huge problem, and I planned my trips accordingly. (My room is in the basement.) I didn't want to ruin my already iffy sleep schedule, so I forced myself to stay awake. I regret this decision deeply. 

I woke up after about 7 hours of sleep that night, and I was heartbroken. I barely felt any better. My thoughts were a little clearer, but that was it. I at least managed to spend most of the day at my desk rather than in bed. I generally didn't feel sick anymore, just extremely tired. I posted about this recently, but I finally got fed up with feeling useless and helpless in my own body. I pushed myself to work out for about an hour - twice as long and more intense than I usually go. I temporarily felt good about myself. I spent the next two days sore - usually, I don't push myself hard enough to get sore at all. 

That night, I only got 7 hours of sleep again. I usually get 8.5-9, and I was already down a lot of hours, so I don't know why this was happening. I had recently been reading about ME/CFS because I thought what I was going through was abnormal. I had the flu recently, and it was similar, but...not the same. My old therapist told me a lot of my experiences sounded like an autoimmune disorder. I don't believe any honest, good therapist with over a decade of experience would have been feeding anxious thoughts that were not grounded in reality. I believe her, and I trust myself. It's easy to forget that. 

I don't know how I found out about ME/CFS, but I did. I do meet the criteria (from my non-medical-degree-having lens), so I thought it was strange that the exercise I did hadn't affected me. Usually, I notice fatigue pretty quickly. Either later that night or the following morning. I felt pretty much the same as I did the previous day - I was tired as hell, but I could manage a few trips upstairs, some self-care, and sitting at my desk. 

As many of you reminded me, the fatigue hit me the following morning. I woke up feeling refreshed after 12 hours of sleep, and I felt hopeful. Then I sat up and realized I was experiencing the worst fatigue of my life. That sleepy 'i just woke up after a deep sleep' feeling was no longer pleasant. It took me an hour to motivate myself to move, and I could barely manage the stairs one at a time with support from the hand rail. 

I have experienced this once before. I was going through THC withdrawals (yes, this is a real thing), and I'd had an explosive PTSD episode. I remember back then I had to sit and scoot down them because I didn't trust my back not to give out. Struggling on the stairs was deja vu. It felt exactly the same. My brain was foggy and fuzzy, and I felt like I was in slow motion. It was just terrible. (I don't smoke anymore, btw.) 

I remember being in the shower feeling absolute misery - it's up two flights of stairs. I felt magnetically drawn to the floor, but I managed to do everything and then collapse in bed. 

Next day was slightly better. It was pretty much the same, but I felt slightly less fatigued. I was also extremely careful when rationing my energy, and I'd gotten slightly better at doing so. Not really much of note. 

Next day (yesterday) was about the same. I was made very anxious by this - what if I permanently shrank my energy envelope? How am I going to have the energy for our Easter trip? I'm going to be judged harshly by my family if I back out! I'm an otherwise able-bodied 25yo that everyone thinks is a hypochondriac. I was kinda freaking out. I did my best to reason with myself and stay calm. I know stress is only going to make things even worse regardless of what the real problem is. I took some hydroxyzine and some ibuprofen, and that seemed to help a sizable amount. 

Now today. I woke up to a text from my uncle (whom I live with). I had to put the pets in different rooms and open the garage because a handyman is coming. I got up, walked up the stairs, and realized - oh my god, I did it without thinking. I was excited and relieved by this. I WILL have the energy to pack today instead of dipping into the negative. I keep reminding myself that I shouldn't overdo it even though I feel mostly better, but there's so much I need to do. 

I'm confused and conflicted - was it really just the flu, and I overcame it? Is it really my mental illness that limits the amount of energy I have? Then I remember all the things I've downplayed for so long - this weird chronic rash I've been gaslit into not worrying about, my joint pain which can be debilitating, some mild hypermobility issues. I'm in a really weird head space right now! 

My old doctor ran exactly one blood test when I brought up joint pain and other issues. Despite the rash, my antibodies or white blood cells or whatever were normal, and then she attributed everything to lifestyle choices. I've been doing exercise for a while, and I've never been affected like this - but then again, I think I've gotten really good at pacing myself naturally. I only exercise on days where I haven't much else to do. AHHH. I feel crazy! 

If I get all the way to the specialist and learn that I'm wrong, it'll be humiliating. But I've been eating right for 3 months and noticed no changes in my body, and I've been running consistently for a month and also noticed little to no changes other than it is slightly easier to run. Honestly, the only difference about diet is that I increased fiber too quickly and I'm suffering the consequences. 

I just let out a big sigh. Thinking about all this is so exhausting. I'm going to see my new doctor next Tuesday about this fatigue. I'm scared. My anxiety gets me tongue tied and puts my foot in my mouth. But I have to try. I'm hoping if anyone sees and responds to this that I can gain some confidence. 

My meds are working. I have a safe, emotionally and financially stable home. I'm the happiest I've ever been. Why is it still so hard to leave the house? Why am I not getting better anymore? Something is being overlooked. I'm sure of it, but that doubt always creeps back. ",0,1744918318.0,cfs,0,0.5,False

My partner (31 M) and I (27 F) will be relocating to Atlanta from DC near the end of this summer. He will be working in the office in Peachtree Corners, while I will (ideally) be WFH. We're looking to rent a 2bd, 2 bath apartment  for about or under 3k/mo.

Q1: Is it feasible for us to share a car? We've been fortunate enough to get by with DC's excellent public transit and walkability, but are anticipating that may prove more of a challenge in ATL.

Q2: Do folks have any recommendations for particular neighborhoods or buildings to check out? We'd really like to live somewhere walkable (able to walk to the grocery store, coffee shops, gym, etc). We have been considering Midtown and Buckhead primarily (although the latter seems less walkable from Google streetview).We also have cats so we will need a place that is pet-friendly.

Without looking at the comments, can you provide translations for these short (**but challenging!**) sentences (3 English-Italian, 3 Italian-English)? I‚Äôll evaluate your responses and give you feedback. The exercise is designed to be intermediate/advanced level, but beginners and lower intermediate learners are welcome if they feel like testing the scope of their current knowledge. *I might take a few days to answer* (usually up to around a week if there‚Äôs high participation) but I will read and evaluate all participants.

If you‚Äôre not sure about a particular translation, just go with it! The exercise is meant to weed out mistakes, this is not a school test!  
**If multiple translations are possible, choose the one you believe to be more likely give the limited context** (I won‚Äôt deduct points for guessing missing information, for example someone's gender, unless it's heavily implied in the sentence).

**There is no time limit to submit your answer**. If you want to go back to the first ever edition and work your way up from there, you can. Just know that I usually prioritise later posts.

**THE TEST**

Here are the sentences, *vaguely* ranked from easiest to hardest in each section (A: English-Italian, B: Italian-English).

**A1)** ""To be or not to be, that is the question""  
**A2)** ""He walked all the way to the end of the corridor before realising that he had no idea where he was supposed to go""  
**A3)** ""It's taller than it's wide, so you better load it on its side instead""  

**B1)** ""Non pensavo saresti venuta, tant'√® che manco ho apparecchiato""  
**B2)** ""Sia A l'insieme dei numeri interi con al pi√π tre fattori primi distinti‚Ä¶""  
**B3)** ""A forza di rimandare qui si fa sera, mi sa""  

**Current average**: N/A (median N/A)

**EVALUATION (and how to opt out)**

If you manage to provide a translation for all 6 I'll give you a score from 1 to 10 (the standard evaluation system in Italian schools). Whatever score you receive, don't take it too seriously: this is just a game! However, if you feel like receiving a score is too much pressure anyway, you can just tell me at the start of your comment and I'll only correct your mistakes.

Based on the results so far, here‚Äôs the usual range of votes depending on the level of the participants. Ideally, your objective is to score within your personal range or possibly higher:

**Absolute beginners**: ‚â§4  
**Beginners**: 4 - 5  
**Early intermediate**: 5 - 6.5  
**Advanced intermediate**: 6.5 - 8  
**Advanced**: ‚â•8  
**Natives**: ‚â•9 (with good English)  
*Note: the specific range might change a lot depending on the difficulty of this specific exercise. I try to be consistent, but it‚Äôs very hard*

**IF YOU ARE A NATIVE ITALIAN SPEAKER**

You can still participate if you want (the exercise is theoretically symmetrical between Italian and English), but please keep in mind that these sentences are designed to be particularly challenging for *non* native speakers, so they might be easier for you. For this reason, I‚Äôd prefer it if you specified that you are a native speaker at the beginning of your comment: I‚Äôm collecting statistics on how well learners score on these tests in order to fine tune them (and personal curiosity), so mixing up the results from natives and non-natives will probably mess it up.

Also, since I've been asked a couple of times by now, I've recently set up a [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/crown85469). If you appreciate what I do and want to offer me a coffee as thanks, feel free to do so. **Only** donate if you have money to throw away: I'm doing this because I like it, any money I get from it is just an extra bonus and I won't treat people differently based on whether they decide do donate or not, it really doesn't matter to me.

1k1l7gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1k1l7gp/putting_my_thoughts_on_paper_sorta/,Putting my thoughts on paper (sorta),"I know most won‚Äôt understand this. But, trying to think out my emotions and feelings.

Before starting the story I am know I am mostly in the wrong here;

I became a co-owner of a friends coffee place 2 years ago. Small cash down and sweat equity for the rest with an end of accrual of sweat equity in three years. Agreed final % at the end. 

Anyways his place was losing a lot of money because of poor choices in GM‚Äôs. It was a good opportunity for me because I knew what needed to be fixed etc. Anyways, there was a worker already there that I thought could be a good GM but needed work. I had been laid off from my full time job at the time and took the offer. I personally decided she should be the GM going forward and I‚Äôd train her and build her up over time into the role. She agreed and so the work began. 

We started building up a good friendship during this as well. My partner lives far away so is not around, leaving me to the day to day while I train her. There was some sexual tension between us but I knew that never ends well and I also was in a long term relationship with a girl I wanted to marry. So I did not do anything. Obviously enjoyed the attraction though (who doesn‚Äôt like feel attracted by another). Anyways, a couple months in my grandma went into hospice. She died not long after. 2 days later my mom died suddenly and unexpectedly. We weren‚Äôt super close but it was mom none the less. The day my grandma died my long term of many years girlfriend broke up with me. We were having issues. Some mine some hers. I should have seen the signs, but, love makes us blind. She left and moved out. 

Three significant losses in a matter of three days. I always considered myself strong and have been through a lot but this broke me. Being honest here since no one will know me, I was more pained and hurt by my ex than I was by the deaths. I love both members of my family but this was what I thought the love of my life. So in a nutshell THAT breakup (the one that changes everything).

During this time I got hired to go back to full time work while I also was still over seeing the new GM and operations at the coffee place. To give context to my mental anguish through the next 4-5 months (it‚Äôs important) I lost my full time new job because I couldn‚Äôt work. I was a sad excuse for a guy in the fetile position everyday. Mostly due to my ex leaving and everything feeling the impact of my mom. 

So while in the anguished state of not being able to work and not showering etc etc my GM and me got closer she had been through something like this before and was trying to help me through. One thing leads to another and were now being physical with me lying and being deceitful that I was over my ex (I thought protruding outwards would make it real on the inside). I hadn‚Äôt been through this type of breakup yet. I didn‚Äôt understand rebounds and all of that etc. 

I still lied tho and over the next 4-5 months I slowly realized what I had done and the hurt that I had caused her (she figured out I wasn‚Äôt really over my ex). Let alone the imbalance of power at the coffee shop I put her in. Wrong, wrong, wrong.

I didn‚Äôt want my partner to know so we agreed to move back to being friends and trying to separate the shop from personal. As I‚Äôm sure you guessed that didn‚Äôt work out well over time. It took a year of sometimes fighting because she was still hurt and wanted a real relationship with me and I essentially had strung her along and wasn‚Äôt ready. I apologized profusely for this, many times. I was wrong and hurt her. 

As decisions had to be made over the next year at the shop, if I didn‚Äôt make the decisions she wanted she would take it personally because of the relationship we had. I failed at trying to solve that problem and the arguments kept boiling up until 2 weeks ago when we got into another yelling match. She got off the phone with me and called my partner and told him everything. 

Now he is upset (rightfully so) that I hid this from him. I accept that. He would like to make it work with the three of us. 

While I was wrong and very much so at the beginning I also feel betrayed by her. There could have been a better way to resolve the issue. Like going to my partner together and working through it. 

I don‚Äôt know if I have the right to feel betrayed but I do. I did do a lot for her as well. I didn‚Äôt want to minimize the harm I have caused her and prop myself up by listing all of it earlier. But, I did try and make it right and do a lot for her professionally and personally through the year of fighting before she disclosed everything to business partner.

He wants us three to get on a call and flush this out. Which right now I‚Äôm still very angry and feel betrayed by her and have told him I am pondering leaving the business entirely. I have to make a decision by the end of the week. I am struggling to want to speak with her because I feel betrayed but I do accept and understand I betrayed her at the beginning.

**Hopefully, this post inspires someone to do what I did.**

My name is Matias, I‚Äôm 24 years old, and I consider myself a pretty experienced traveler for my age. I‚Äôve already lived in 8 countries: Argentina, the USA, Germany, France, Czech Republic, Portugal, Lithuania, and Sweden. I grew up in Buenos Aires, which gave me the street smarts and confidence to travel the world without being overly worried about safety or scams ‚Äî a kind of 5D radar for avoiding weird situations.

I‚Äôm also someone very *structured*. I finished my BA in Buenos Aires at 22, and later won a full Erasmus Mundus scholarship to study in Europe. But beyond structure and planning, there‚Äôs something that has always fascinated me: **capital cities**.

There‚Äôs something about them ‚Äî they‚Äôre all unique, yet they often share certain traits: embassies, museums, political tension, and a reputation for being misunderstood or disliked by the rest of their own countries. That mix of similarity and difference always draws me in. Also, you can find cheap food! And burek was literally all I ate for a month.

After watching the BBC documentary *The Death of Yugoslavia* and meeting people from the ex-Yugoslavia, I decided to give that region a go. I wanted to spend 3 days in every capital of the Balkans, plus Bucharest and Sofia. I didn‚Äôt care about long stays ‚Äî my time was limited. I had from the beginning of August until the 6th of September (between my summer school in Nice and the start of my next semester in Lisbon). But first, I made some rules:

1. **No phone**. I only had my old Lenovo laptop. I work remotely and I felt like my phone had become an extension of my body. I wanted a break. Of course, my girlfriend wasn‚Äôt thrilled.
2. **Solo trip**. Even though I‚Äôm very social, I wanted to do this one alone.
3. **Magnet rule**. I had to buy a magnet for my girlfriend in every city. Non-negotiable.
4. **Old camera, 36 pictures only**. I brought my analog camera ‚Äî one film roll, one shot per vibe.
5. **Cheap hostels and burek budget**. Max 10 euros/day for hostels + 3 euros/day for food. Honestly, that‚Äôs all you need in the Balkans!

**Slovenia (Ljubljana)**  
I started in Nice, where my summer school ended. After watching the end of the Tour de France, the plan was the following: to take a Flixbus from Nice to Ljubljana. So, I gave my phone to my Indian friend and told him to wait for me in Lisbon, and after a big hug, I left for the adventure.  
First bus was different than anything else I felt, going to a new place is always a great feeling... and I found myself in Ljubljana, getting to know people. The highlight there was smoking pot with a Romanian truck driver (who spoke Spanish) and lived on a bench! Also here, I realized that I was going to eat 1 burek per day and walk around.

**Croatia (Zagreb)**  
After that, I went to Croatia, Zagreb ‚Äî in my opinion, with Bratislava, the worst one, so nothing fun. I just realized it was full of people from Eastern Asia living there, so I made a lot of friends from there!

**Bosnia and Herzegovina (Sarajevo)**  
From there I went to Bosnia, and I have to say, Sarajevo stole my heart. It was my first time talking with the blue hats from the United Nations!

**Montenegro (Podgorica)**  
Then, it was the turn of Montenegro. The only good thing was that 1 gram of weed was 3 euros! So I spent 3 days high. This was amazing because the capital was the most horrendous place I have seen in my life, but the people were amazing!

**Albania (Tirana)**  
Then Tirana, where I learned that Kosovo is not Serbia ‚Äî but Albania, according to them... After seeing some gangsters and the craziest traffic I saw in my life, I took a bus to Kosovo!

**Kosovo (Pristina)**  
Then I went to Kosovo, and a Serbian told me I was in Serbia, but my friend from Kosovo told me I was in Kosovo and it was a country (ofc it‚Äôs a country, only a joke‚Ä¶). I realized that you can be rich with 3 euros and also that the nightlife in Prishtina is pretty good!

**North Macedonia (Skopje)**  
After Kosovo, I went to North Macedonia, that has a great museum honoring everyone who fought for their country... but when you leave the museum you see a 100000 meter statue of Alexander, and let's be honest, he was not even from there. So, poor people who died for that land ‚Äî they don‚Äôt even have an honest recognition... but great people!

**Bulgaria (Sofia)**  
From there I left to Sofia, and oh boy, that metro system is amazing!

**Romania (Bucharest)**  
From Sofia, to Bucharest ‚Äî the weirdest place ever... but mega fun at night! So, good city to party, bad one to orient yourself at night!

**Serbia (Belgrade)**  
From Bucharest, I went to Belgrade in 2 buses, and I can say that place felt like Russia. But it was very cheap, nice coffee, nice rivers, and also great modern art museum!

**Hungary (Budapest)**  
From there I went to Budapest, and I realized that the Austro-Hungarian Empire was real ‚Äî because it‚Äôs mega similar to Vienna!

**Slovakia (Bratislava)**  
Then I went to Bratislava, and thank god I stayed one day in the most boring place on earth!

**Final thoughts:**  
It‚Äôs cheap. It‚Äôs safe. And the human quality I found in the Balkans was second to none.

1k1l3ro,https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/1k1l3ro/certified_admin_exam_passed_first_attempt/,Certified Admin exam passed - first attempt,"Hello fellow trailblazers! I just wanted to come on here and share my exciting news about passing on my first attempt at the certified salesforce admin exam. This subreddit has been invaluable with the advice that I have received here which I attribute my success to that, a lot of coffee, and lofi!

The best advice I can give really is to think back to what your learning process has been generally in life and apply that to how you learn salesforce. I know that seems like a generic response, but it worked for me. I am an avid note taker for example, and part of my process is to write down dang near everything and make flashcards. This was my formula:

* Certified admin trailmix

FoF Study guide and FoF Practice exams:

* Watch the group study video that corresponds to the section in the slides

* Watch the overview video in that section before getting to the slide deck

* Go through every slide in the slide deck, and I took very detailed notes on every single slide in the entire study guide

* Take the corresponding exam for that section with the option of 'show me the answers after each question' where I would take even more notes on the questions where I got it wrong. I would even take notes on the one's that I got right but was still confused about the topic

* I also used the reference links to the salesforce documentation in the practice exams and took notes on any details that were missing from the description under each practice exam question

* After going through all of the videos, slide decks, and corresponding practice exams I did the focus review test and took more notes again on the wrong answers and then made flashcards

  
Some additional resources I had used was some quizlet flashcards that a member of this subreddit shared. I also took a few of the mock admin exams on focus on force, as well as the salesforce ben mock admin exam.

I understand that while my process might not work for everyone or might be too time consuming for some- it allowed me to repetitively see the information and that's what really made it stick in my brain. It allowed me to be able to understand why an answer was the answer, and not just because I memorized it.

I would say also that there is value add spending time actually being hands-on in the system. One of the projects that I was working on was creating a mock SFDC implementation of the SFDC implementation at my work. I would then use that dev org to implement enhancements that I could show to stakeholders who would then present that to the sys admins. One of the enhancements that I built was dynamic forms, and I learned how powerful the criteria that you can define there is. I had several questions about dynamic forms, and some of those questions didn‚Äôt even use the word ‚Äòdynamic form‚Äô, but I knew what it was because I had built that before.

The exam itself will really try and trick you with fluff wording in the questions, scenario based, and putting multiple answers that sound like they would be the correct answers but aren't- which is why it is so important to understand why an answer is right conceptually. I used 104 minutes out of 105 minutes because I reviewed every single question and spent extra time on the questions that I marked for review. Definitely do not rush the exam, because it is easy to think an answer is right, but it really is a trap.

I am trying to think of other advice that I could give, but off the top of my head that is all I have for now. Please feel free to ask me any questions!

Not that you esteemed (esteamed?) folks need to hear more reasons to tar, feather, and then actually ride Trump out of town on a rail any minute now, but while we're wallowing in this Pig Slop Presidency, here's a Partial List of Asinine Stupid Trump Errors and Recklessness. or, what we will now call: PLASTER

WORST CABINET IN HISTORY:

Remember when the schoolyard rich kid brought his new official NFL football to school (and you hated him) and he would only let his butt kissing friends (who you hated) play? Remember he never let you play because you were better, and so you used to have to watch from the shady (shady because it was in the shade) side of the playground, with your cooler friends and you would all laugh at them for not throwing perfect spirals as good and as far as you and your friends could.

That's what Trump's Cabinet is. A wobbly spiral. The wobbliest. Anyone of us on this Sub would be better.üèà

Consider the disastress in-waiting, Kristi ""A Nose Job Too Far"" Noem is rooting around the Department of Homeland Security now, to forage, for comfort, and as a form of communication. I'm saying she is pig.üê∑

We've already seen the keen eye for derail from the single dumbest Secretary of Offense, Pete ""Shot Put Champion"" (because he can put away shots ü•É) Hegseth. Who apparently likes texting strangers in way too much detail, about his penchant for torturing small angry Yemenis. Who in context are necessarily small and angry. Which is precisely why Hegseth picked on them. They're angry because no one gives them any credit for inventing, roasting, and then brewing COFFEE! If you even mention REFINED SUGAR (which they also invented) why them's would be fightin' words. And your oil tankers will be toast.

But even more prophetic of all the demented dumdums Trump has deemed a good fit for orifice, is the Malekeh Hindustan (Queen of India) herself, Kashyap Pramod Patel! Whose continuous ""Who me?üò≥"" look of surprise is only matched by our ""Who him?"" look of disappointment. On a Sidenut: Kashyap is the Hindi word for Deer (true). Which would apparently make Pramod the Hindi word for Headlights (not true, but funny no?). Which now completely explains his signature ""look"", and why he always appears as he does, as he will now routinely appear, because he will be appearing at many congressional hearings to come. Hearing which is apparently the Hindi word for ""skittish"" (Also not true, but also funny, no?).

Trigonelline is a methylated form of niacin and is a recently isolated molecule that could be the secret ingredient in your stack. This form of the B vitamin is involved in the generation of NAD+, a cofactor for over 500 metabolic processes in cells. Trigonelline promotes cellular repair and energy, and as we‚Äôll see, exerts quite a few benefits that are specifically useful for anyone training seriously.

Trigonelline is found in several plant-based foods, notably coffee beans and fenugreek seeds. Green coffee beans contain trigonelline concentrations ranging from 0.6% to 1.0% by weight. However, traditional dietary sources don‚Äôt provide sufficient amounts to elicit significant physiological effects. For instance, the average trigonelline content in a cup of coffee is approximately 53 mg, and about 50-80% of trigonelline decomposes during the roasting process, leaving virtually nothing for your body to make use of.

Recent research published on this naturally occurring alkaloid highlights its potential in enhancing muscle function and combating age-related decline. A 2024 study published in Nature Metabolism identified trigonelline as a novel precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a molecule essential for energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. The study demonstrated that trigonelline supplementation improved muscle strength and reduced fatigue in aged mice, suggesting that it can head off the natural muscle decline seen in aging, even in those who are already training at capacity.

# The Real NAD+ Level Up for Athletes

NAD+ gets discussed a lot in the longevity space because of its natural and steep decline over the years, tied to all the diseases of aging. It's a metabolic linchpin that determines how efficiently your cells convert fuel into usable energy. For athletes, that efficiency translates into faster recovery, better performance under load, and greater resilience under metabolic stress. Or, you know, complete lack of those things if you don‚Äôt have enough of it.

NAD+ is required for redox (oxidation‚Äìreduction) reactions in mitochondrial energy production and is a cofactor and substrate for longevity-promoting sirtuins and other enzymes involved in muscle repair and adaptation. During intense physical activity, NAD+ levels drop as demand for ATP surges. Replenishing intracellular NAD+ is critical not only for restoring mitochondrial output but also for initiating the cellular programs that rebuild and reinforce muscle tissue \[1\].

Trigonelline offers a direct path to NAD+‚Äîone that bypasses the liver and supports muscle tissue specifically. In a landmark 2024 study, researchers at EPFL and Nestl√© Health Sciences (yes,¬†*that*¬†Nestl√©, but there aren‚Äôt any conflicts of interest, we checked) demonstrated that trigonelline functions as a previously unidentified NAD+ precursor, rapidly taken up by skeletal muscle cells and converted into NAD+ via a salvage pathway independent of the traditional NR or NMN routes \[2\]. This muscle-specific uptake is particularly important for athletes, who require localized replenishment in the very tissues under stress.

Most NAD+ precursors‚Äîincluding nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)‚Äîundergo hepatic metabolism before entering systemic circulation. This creates a bottleneck at your liver for targeted muscle repair. Trigonelline appears to bypass that constraint by delivering precursors directly where they're needed most: the muscle fibers responsible for performance and endurance.

This shift in delivery has implications beyond simple NAD+ restoration. In the same¬†*Nature Metabolism*¬†study, aged mice supplemented with trigonelline showed significant improvements in grip strength and fatigue resistance‚Äîoutcomes tightly linked to muscle NAD+ availability. Unlike systemic precursors that may elevate circulating NAD+ levels without improving localized bioenergetics, trigonelline drives changes in muscle mitochondrial density and function.

For athletes, this is the difference between feeling recovered and actually being rebuilt.

# Mitochondria Make Muscles Move

# Endurance Starts in the Electron Transport Chain

Every sprint, every lift, every set depends on one thing: mitochondrial output. The ability to generate ATP on demand‚Äîefficiently and cleanly‚Äîis the defining line between sustained power and early fatigue. Trigonelline‚Äôs value lies not just in elevating NAD+ levels, but in what that elevation enables at the level of mitochondrial performance.

NAD+ drives oxidative phosphorylation, the mitochondrial pathway responsible for converting nutrients into ATP. When NAD+ is depleted, electron transport slows, reactive oxygen species accumulate, and mitochondrial output tanks‚Äîresulting in performance collapse and prolonged recovery. Replenishing NAD+ restores mitochondrial throughput, enhances metabolic flexibility, and allows cells to switch between carbohydrate and fat oxidation with minimal friction \[3\].

Trigonelline‚Äôs role as a direct NAD+ precursor in muscle tissue makes it especially powerful in this context. By bypassing hepatic metabolism and restoring NAD+ where it's most needed, it kickstarts mitochondrial biogenesis‚Äîactivating pathways like PGC-1Œ± that drive the formation of new mitochondria and increase the efficiency of existing ones \[4\]. This isn‚Äôt theoretical: in the 2024¬†*Nature Metabolism*¬†study, trigonelline supplementation significantly boosted mitochondrial content and activity in aged mice, restoring performance metrics typically lost with age and overtraining \[2\].

This cellular shift translates directly to the field, the track, and the gym. More mitochondria means more ATP per unit of oxygen consumed. This is the underpinning of higher VO‚ÇÇ max, improved lactate clearance, and extended time-to-exhaustion. Trigonelline supports this adaptation at the source, which means athletes can train harder, go longer, and bounce back faster‚Äîwithout relying on stimulants or sketchy ergogenics.

More NAD+ in muscle equals better mitochondrial kinetics, which equals better athletic output. Period.

# Strength and Muscle Health

# Preserving Power, Not Just Mass

Strength isn‚Äôt only about size‚Äîit‚Äôs about contractile quality, neuromuscular precision, and the cellular capacity to resist breakdown under stress. Trigonelline‚Äôs impact on muscle tissue reaches beyond endurance. It supports structural integrity, performance output, and resilience across multiple pathways‚Äîespecially in the context of aging or chronic training demand.

In the 2024¬†*Nature Metabolism*¬†study, trigonelline supplementation restored muscle grip strength and improved fatigue resistance in aged mice, with outcomes exceeding those observed in control groups receiving traditional NAD+ precursors \[2\]. This effect was tied to increased NAD+ availability in skeletal muscle, which reactivated SIRT1- and PGC-1Œ±-dependent pathways responsible for mitochondrial biogenesis, inflammation control, and protein maintenance‚Äîall critical for contractile performance and mass preservation \[5\].

NAD+ also plays a protective role against muscle wasting. It regulates the balance between anabolic and catabolic signaling, modulating FoxO transcription factors and suppressing atrophy-related genes like¬†*MuRF1*¬†and¬†*atrogin-1*¬†\[6\]. This anti-catabolic signaling becomes especially important during periods of calorie deficit, illness, or overreaching, when muscle degradation accelerates. Trigonelline, by supplying NAD+ directly to muscle cells, may help maintain lean mass even under systemic stress.

One overlooked aspect of muscle performance is neuromuscular junction (NMJ) stability, or, the connections between nerves and muscle fibers. These connections go both ways, with afferent signals carrying sensory feedback from muscle to brain, and efferent signals delivering motor commands from brain to muscle. Maintaining the integrity of this bidirectional communication is essential for coordination, strength, and rapid recovery from fatigue. NAD+ is required for the function of enzymes that protect NMJ architecture‚Äîparticularly in aging or disease models where synaptic decline contributes to strength loss \[7\]. Trigonelline‚Äôs direct muscle delivery may therefore preserve the electrical signaling fidelity needed for explosive power and motor unit recruitment.

# Muscle Fiber Type Preservation

Emerging evidence suggests that NAD+ availability influences muscle fiber type composition. High NAD+ levels favor the maintenance of fast-twitch (Type II) fibers‚Äîthose responsible for strength, speed, and power‚Äîby enhancing mitochondrial support without triggering full transition to slow-twitch oxidative profiles \[8\]. This has implications for athletes seeking to maintain peak force output without compromising endurance. By elevating muscle NAD+ directly, trigonelline may help preserve this delicate fiber balance.

Trigonelline is formulated not to just support general energy‚Äîbut to protect the architecture of athleticism at the cellular level.

# Breathing and VO‚ÇÇ Max

# Cellular Efficiency Becomes Cardiovascular Edge

Most performance metrics‚ÄîVO‚ÇÇ max, lactate threshold, oxygen pulse‚Äîare measured at the level of the lungs, blood, and heart. But the real bottleneck for oxygen utilization doesn‚Äôt start in the chest. It starts in the mitochondria. Trigonelline supports athletic breathing capacity not by altering the respiratory system directly, but by optimizing the cellular machinery that determines how efficiently oxygen is used once it arrives.

Mitochondrial efficiency is the central variable in VO‚ÇÇ max‚Äîthe maximum rate at which the body can use oxygen during exercise. NAD+ has direct role in this equation by enabling electron transfer through Complex I of the electron transport chain, which drives ATP synthesis from aerobic metabolism \[9\]. When NAD+ is depleted, this throughput breaks down. That leads to a reliance on anaerobic pathways, quicker lactate buildup, and faster fatigue.

Trigonelline restores NAD+ levels specifically in muscle tissue, where the oxygen is being delivered and consumed. This translates to improved mitochondrial respiration and delayed onset of anaerobic metabolism. In aged mice, trigonelline supplementation preserved muscle oxygenation capacity and enhanced mitochondrial density‚Äîfactors tightly linked with increased VO‚ÇÇ max and muscular endurance \[2\].

Indirectly, this affects respiratory performance. When skeletal muscles become more efficient at oxygen uptake and ATP production, the entire cardiorespiratory system adapts:

* Heart rate at submaximal workloads drops
* Pulmonary ventilation is reduced for the same output
* Lactate threshold rises, allowing sustained efforts at higher intensities

Although no direct studies have yet measured trigonelline's effect on VO‚ÇÇ max in humans, the mechanistic link is strong. Increased muscle NAD+ availability and mitochondrial optimization have already been shown to shift oxygen kinetics and improve aerobic performance in studies using other NAD+ precursors \[10\].

Trigonelline focuses on cellular oxygen utilization‚Äîwhere true endurance begins.

# Recovery, Inflammation, and Resilience

# Rebuild the System‚ÄîDon‚Äôt Just Rest It

Recovery is not passive. It‚Äôs a high-demand physiological process that rebuilds tissue, regulates inflammation, restores neurotransmitter balance, and recharges the nervous system. Trigonelline addresses this phase of performance with precision‚Äîby supporting NAD+ regeneration in both muscle and brain tissue, where fatigue and dysfunction accumulate fastest.

Emerging data point to trigonelline‚Äôs ability to elevate NAD+ in the brain‚Äînot just the periphery. In the 2024¬†*Nature Metabolism*¬†study, oral trigonelline was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of treated mice, suggesting central nervous system penetration \[11\]. This is important because brain NAD+ availability influences neuroinflammation, cognitive performance, and mental fatigue‚Äîall of which degrade physical output and recovery when compromised.

NAD+ is essential for the activity of sirtuins and PARPs that modulate neuroinflammation and neuronal repair. Low brain NAD+ levels are associated with microglial activation and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-Œ± and IL-6 \[11\]. By supplying a precursor that crosses the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, trigonelline may support CNS recovery in a way other NAD+ precursors cannot. This means lower perceived fatigue, better focus, and faster return to training intensity after neurologically demanding sessions. It isn‚Äôt a masking effect or a stimulant ‚Äì trigonelline is supplying cells with the necessary fuel to recover faster and perform better under greater demand.

Athletic inflammation isn't pathological‚Äîit‚Äôs functional. But poor resolution of inflammation post-training leads to longer recovery windows, greater risk of overtraining, and diminished adaptations. Trigonelline, by enhancing intracellular NAD+ pools, may support the regulation of key inflammatory mediators including NF-Œ∫B, IL-1Œ≤, and IL-6 through sirtuin activation and mitochondrial repair pathways \[12\]. These effects contribute to resilience‚Äîboth in terms of immune readiness and tissue regeneration.

Trigonelline builds biological capacity to recover harder and faster than you ever thought possible.

# Who Should Use Trigonelline (and Why They‚Äôll Never Go Back)

# From Peak Performers to Tactical Operators‚ÄîTrigonelline Redefines the Edge

Trigonelline is not a casual supplement. It's engineered for those operating at the threshold‚Äîwhere performance, precision, and recovery can‚Äôt be compromised. Whether you‚Äôre chasing podiums, pushing PRs, or preparing for missions, the need is the same: sustained mitochondrial output, fast-twitch preservation, and nervous system resilience under pressure.

# Endurance Athletes ‚Äì Runners, Cyclists, Triathletes

These athletes operate in the oxidative zone. VO‚ÇÇ max, lactate threshold, and mitochondrial density determine race-day results and mission-critical outcomes. Trigonelline enhances muscle oxygen use by restoring NAD+ where it matters: inside the muscle cell \[2\]. That means fewer crashes, faster splits, and greater metabolic flexibility when switching between fat and carb fuel systems. It's a molecular upgrade to the aerobic engine.

# Strength-Focused Lifters ‚Äì Clean Gains, Maximum Output

Muscle isn‚Äôt just about mass‚Äîit‚Äôs about fiber quality, contractility, and neuromuscular firing. Trigonelline supports Type II fiber preservation, anabolic signaling, and ATP availability under load \[2\]. Unlike pre-workouts that spike and crash, this is foundational fuel replenishment‚Äîrestoring the internal chemistry that allows progressive overload to translate into real strength gains.

# Older Athletes ‚Äì Keeping Output High Without Compromise

Aging athletes face the double burden of recovery slowdowns and mitochondrial decline. Trigonelline addresses both. It ramps up mitochondrial biogenesis, supports neuromuscular junction integrity, and suppresses muscle wasting signals‚Äîhelping maintain strength, speed, and stamina long past the age most competitors tap out \[2\].

# Tactical Professionals ‚Äì Military, First Responders, Elite Operators

Physical fitness is mission-critical in high-stress, high-stakes environments. Trigonelline doesn‚Äôt just support output‚Äîit buffers the system against inflammatory cascades, central fatigue, and energy collapse. When your recovery window is short and your next task is already loading, you don‚Äôt need hype. You need molecular readiness.

Trigonelline isn‚Äôt for weekend warriors. It‚Äôs for athletes serious about capacity, adaptation, and longevity in high-performance domains. Once your cells experience what targeted NAD+ replenishment actually feels like, there‚Äôs no going back.

# The Future of Natural Performance Enhancement Is Molecular

Performance isn't fueled by macros alone. It‚Äôs driven by the molecules that dictate how cells generate energy, repair damage, and resist fatigue under stress. Trigonelline is a signal molecule‚Äîone that tells your body to build more mitochondria, recover faster, and keep power output high even under pressure. It‚Äôs not hype. It‚Äôs molecular physiology, applied with precision.

Mortalis Labs isolates what nature only hints at and delivers it in a form your biology can immediately use. Trigonelline isn‚Äôt about stacking stimulants or chasing short-term pumps. It‚Äôs about equipping your cells with the precursors they need to function like you‚Äôre still in your prime‚Äîand then some.

If your protocol is still built around protein percentages and caffeine timing, it‚Äôs time to rethink what performance support actually means. Upgrade to molecular interventions that don‚Äôt just fill gaps‚Äîthey redefine baselines.

A genuine connection. I‚Äôm not chasing labels or rushing into anything just open to something built on trust, depth, and presence. If it turns into a relationship, great. If it becomes a meaningful friendship, that‚Äôs just as valuable.

A bit about me:

By day, I‚Äôm a coder. I also have a master‚Äôs degree in nuclear physics and I‚Äôm preparing for my PhD which means lots of studying and a few late-night brain farts (GRE & TOEFL). Life can be intense, but I balance it with calm moments and simple joys.

I love long conversations over coffee, night walks, and getting lost in the quiet parts of a city. I prefer the hidden alleys where the real stories live.

One day, I will ride a motorcycle across Europe. The back seat‚Äôs open. maybe you‚Äôre the right kind of adventure?

Still planning my first tattoo, but first, I‚Äôm working on getting in shape. Got any ideas or cool ink stories? I‚Äôm all ears.

What I‚Äôm looking for:

Emotional maturity. Calm, kind energy. A connection where we can be real, not perform. I‚Äôm not into surface-level stuff. Just looking for someone who enjoys depth, curiosity, and the kind of quiet that doesn‚Äôt need to be filled.

If something here made you smile and say hi. Or tell me one small thing that made your day better. I‚Äôd love to hear it.

I went to go and brush my teeth and saw my FIL standing in the hallway between the bathroom and my husband and I's room. I thought he was wondering. I went, brushed my teeth and washed my face and when I left the bathroom i saw he was eating something, he found the banana stash (he's diabetic but if he has a small one or half of one he'll be okay and he has meds). So i go back into our room and finish getting prepared for the day. I come back out to get water bottles and learn he was eating spoiled chicken from our trash bin. 

Let me explain, my MIL has a small trash bag/bun for food waste and regular bin for garbage. Thats cause spoiled food makes the trash stinky. So FIL was eating the spoiled food from the bag on the counter. My MIL took it away from him and told him he can't eat that. She should me that he also made ""coffee"" with water, tomato paste, and took the pump from the dish soap bottle to stir it. Thinking about it makes me gag. 

So FIL gets pissed, starts calling MIL a Pendenja and other horrible names. He's gonna get sick for sure. But I tried telling my husband to create a safety plan, contact IHSS, get POA, Find a support group, attend therapy. I do contact Alzheimer's Association, but I'm at my wits end. I need my husband, and I say this lovingly, to pull his head out his butt and do something. I'm on the verge of speaking to APS. 

But all basic needs are met. So they won't be much help and create chaos. I'm so done. I love my Mil, FIL, and Husband. But the denial my husband clings to is, in my experience making him unable to help provide necessary care and the same can be said for MIL. I can go on and on. Again, basic needs are being met. But its the whole, mental health meds, locking things up, taking away the tv remote, and now doing garbage duty differently. 

I'm so frustrated and need to vent. I don't know what to do. I feel bad, i feel like I let him eat the spoiled food. But I can't do much because he doesn't listen to anyone really except for husband and MIL. What can I do? ",6,1744916423.0,dementia,3,1.0,False

Strap in everyone as this is a long one but trust me it‚Äôs worth it. 

This all happened 30 years ago so I‚Äôll start with some context. 

I had finished agricultural college and luckily got a ‚Äúdream job‚Äù working for a very well known horse yard. I knew that if I could work there for a few years I could walk into any job I fancied. The yard is owned by a very wealthy international business man we shall call Philip. At the yard there was a single story house for all the grooms to live in. So full of hope, I stuffed my car full of bits and bobs and I drove across the country to start my new job. 

On my first night I was warned to keep my 
bedroom door locked, odd I thought but I locked it and went to sleep. I was awoken a couple of hours later by someone trying to open my door, I pretended to be asleep and whoever it was moved on to another door!! 

The next day after we had finished our morning duties I decided to have a shower, I hadn‚Äôt noticed before but the window in the shower room wasn‚Äôt opaque and the curtain‚Äôs when fully closed left a 10cm gap right in the middle!! Very strange indeed especially as it was a single story house. Being always prepared for everything I went back to my room and got a couple of safety pins, pinned the curtains closed and had my shower. 

In our living room there was a large bird cage in which lived a beautiful parrot we shall call Sharon. She was sent to live with us from Philips home because she could talk, and would talk all night!! (Take note for later) 

I settled into the daily routine and became friends with my fellow grooms. I was slightly surprised by the high turnover of staff but I was young. Locking my bedroom door at night and pinning the shower room curtains when needed. I was warned that the person trying to get into our bedrooms at night was Philip, if he got into a bedroom he would force himself onto that girl YUK!! He would also look through the shower room window (well that explains the glass and curtains!!) double YUK!!. The girls warned me that he would select one of us to move the muck trailer and help him unload it on the main muck heap, while there he will try it on so just let him feel your boobs and that will keep him happy. ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!! 

Roll on a few days and Philip asked if I could help him with something‚Ä¶.. can I help him unload the muck trailer (dream on sunshine!) so I told him I‚Äôd been driving tractors and trailers since I was a kid and would take one of the girls with me so he could go and get on with his very important business stuff. To say he was not happy about this was an understatement. 

I decided that I didn‚Äôt care about the job or the potential doors it could open in the future I was not putting up with sort of behaviour!! But before I left I had a little petty revenge to sort out. 

Remember Sharon well this is where she comes into her staring role. That talented beautiful parrot learned a brand new shiny phrase ‚ÄúPhilip is a pervert‚Äù she picked it up really quickly too, I felt like a proud parent. I loaded my car up and drove off into the wide blue yonder without a backwards glance. 

Fast forward 30 years to a couple of weeks ago, I was catching up with an old friend from the horsey world. Amongst other things she  brought up that she had been working with Philip and had been to the yard.  I told her that I worked there when I first left college, I started laughing as I told her about teaching Sharon her new phrase. She nearly spat her coffee out laughing, she told me that Sharon is legendary everybody knows that she calls Philip a pervert. 

So that‚Äôs my tail of very long lasting petty revenge, I‚Äôm very proud of my 21 year old self for standing my ground, knowing my self worth and coming up with such good petty revenge. The biggest thank you will always go to Sharon for being a fast learner.

# Her Trip to Japan

* Let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî she only went to Japan to beat Edith there.
* She clearly did zero research and didn‚Äôt care about the culture at all.
* The only thing she seemed to care about was stealing matcha recipes and ideas for her coffee shop.
* No respect for the culture or the people whatsoever.
* Case in point: she *knows* she‚Äôs on a silent train, *says* she knows... and still talks into her microphone and acts obnoxious with Jake. Seriously?

# How She Treats Her Siblings

* Why is she so unnecessarily rude to her siblings?
* I saw a post where someone commented, ‚Äúyou and Nely are twins,‚Äù and her response was: ‚Äúthat used to be an insult.‚Äù Like‚Ä¶ what??
* How do you feel okay talking about your *own* sister like that?
* She posts a bikini photo on Instagram with her sister and brother in the background, clearly not at a flattering angle ‚Äî why even post that?
* Then for Nely‚Äôs birthday, she posts a photo of *herself* at her quincea√±era with young, no-makeup Nely next to her‚Ä¶ come on. (And yeah, I still think Nely looked cute, but it‚Äôs obvious she wouldn‚Äôt want that as her birthday shoutout ‚Äî probably why she didn‚Äôt repost it.)

# Her Personality & Podcast

* She comes off as extremely self-centered and will throw *anyone* under the bus to make herself look better.
* She‚Äôs the definition of a ‚Äúpick me‚Äù and full-blown narcissist.
* On her podcast with Jake, she:
   * Dominates the convo,
   * Talks so fast she‚Äôs literally out of breath (like she doesn‚Äôt want Jake to get a word in),
   * Acts totally disinterested the moment Jake starts talking ‚Äî sipping coffee, zoning out.

# Final Thoughts

* It‚Äôs honestly unsettling how full of herself she is ‚Äî and she‚Äôs not even subtle about it.
* She clearly reads this Reddit, so girl, if your 3rd grade reading skills brought you here: üëâ **DO SOME SELF-REFLECTING.** üëâ **YOU ARE NOT A GOOD PERSON.** üëâ **YOU ARE A MEAN GIRL.**

Take some notes from your sisters. Stop being so jealous.

This thread will hopefully get pinned for easy reference for potential visitors.

On (or about) April 27th, I will edit this body with the tabulated results for each category, giving the Top 5 recommendations for places to go here in Cape May *OR surrounding areas (*definitely stay within Cape May County, but preferably within 10-15 miles*)*. Big chains - Wawa, Dominos, Starbucks, etc. - will be discarded. Of course everyone's responses will still be visible within the thread, so have no fear if your favorite place doesn't make the cut. If you want to qualify your answers with some testimonials (i.e: ""\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is the best winery because their staff is top notch"" or ""\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is the greatest spot for breakfast, you have to try This or That"") go for it; if it makes the cut I'll add in footnotes or otherwise annotate if it's particularly insightful. This may be more important for the final category: which places here in Cape May to **avoid** \- overpriced, diminished quality, horrible wait times, etc**.**

Please fill out what you care to; if you have multiple recommendations for a particular category, by all means share. This list of categories is not all-inclusive, and if there's something that should be added, please let me know!

I have found in recent years I do this with almost every interaction I have with people, which is something I never did before I started treating my bipolar disorder. I know my moods fluctuated a lot before treatment, and hypomania probably made me care less, but I never cared if someone didn‚Äôt like me or thought I said the wrong thing and now I obsess over it. It taints every interaction I have with friends or colleagues because I‚Äôm so worried that I came across as incompetent, insensitive, or any other negative term I could possibly apply. Is this just part of treatment, or a side effect of medication? Does anyone else experience this as a result of getting treatment? It‚Äôs not about them knowing I have bipolar disorder (most do not), but just perceiving me as anything except perfect.

I said I been told I have nice kissable lips. She then tried to cover her comment by saying that' she heard grandma say that when she was little.

It was cold, she said to wait until the weather was nice. Now the weather is perfect. I also noticed when Im driving she leans towards me, and always laughs at my corny jokes. I really like her.

I‚Äôve been dating this guy for about 3 months now, we‚Äôre both in our mid-20s. We talked about being exclusive a while ago, and everything seemed to be going in a serious direction. We met on a dating app, and after chatting for a week, we met for coffee and clicked right away. He told me he was looking for something serious, and same with me.

The thing is, we‚Äôve never actually had a real proper date. He works over 70 hours a week, including weekends, so he barely gets any time off. He mentioned wanting to take me to dinner, but said he just couldn‚Äôt find the time because of work. I understood that at first, but it‚Äôs been three months and it still hasn‚Äôt happened. Even on my birthday (which was on a weekday), he had work so we didn‚Äôt meet. He said he‚Äôd take me out that weekend instead, but that didn‚Äôt happen either.

We usually see each other once a weekend, if he‚Äôs not working the whole day. And when we do, we just hang out at his place, watch a movie, fck, nap, sometimes do errands. That‚Äôs kind of our thing. And honestly, I don‚Äôt really mind that, it‚Äôs chill.

I also know he likes having time to himself and for his hobbies, so I never push him to hang out more. I‚Äôm trying to be understanding because I know he‚Äôs genuinely busy. But lately, I‚Äôve been wondering if he‚Äôs just gotten too comfortable not making any effort.

We talked about it, and he said he‚Äôs just really a workaholic. I told him I get it, and I‚Äôm not asking for anything huge, just a little thoughtfulness sometimes. I‚Äôm not expecting anything fancy. I even told him that I‚Äôm happy with simple stuff like going on walks or watching sunsets.

What really started messing with my head was this one weekend when we were hanging out, and he told me he had to drop me home earlier than usual because his friends asked him to hang out. That kind of stung, because it showed me that he can make time, just maybe not for me.

So now I‚Äôm here wondering‚Ä¶ am I just overthinking this? Or should I accept that this is how things are going to be with him? I like him, but I don‚Äôt want to be in something one-sided. Would really appreciate some honest advice.",1,1744915698.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I had a question a few days ago about some squick feelings I had regarding my partner‚Äôs discussions with a potential new partner who ended up breaking their date. My partner and I realised we needed to discuss and renegotiate things. We both agreed to moving slowly with low-key first dates - for example coffee or dinner and drinks but no sleepovers (I have also agreed to no sex on first dates, he gets a little squirrelly and I‚Äôm happy not to). A few things had occurred that facilitated the discussion, such as I was asked out on a Friday which he was uncomfortable with so I said no. His new match agreed to a lunch date and spending the rest of the day together - she wanted a commitment to a long first date (10 hours-ish) and I was happy with this because of distance. 
Long story short she cancelled this second date, and tried to reschedule a sleepover at a hotel, where they would have intimate alone time and then she would leave for a few hours so it wasn‚Äôt technically a sleepover and then come back in the morning for breakfast. I felt really uncomfortable as this felt like a loophole, but I agreed. Problem is my partner has made me feel really railroaded, like I had no choice but to agree because she will only accept a sleepover first date. I tried to explain that after agreeing to anything he has asked for, especially in terms of prioritising him, this feels like a betrayal. I never said no sleepovers, just ideally not for the first date. 
At this stage my trust that I can ask for what I need or even feel heard is shattered, especially given I am always really accommodating to his needs. Am I in the wrong, and do I need to break this off. We‚Äôve been together three years and while we don‚Äôt live together I love him very deeply. I‚Äôm so hurt and confused right now.

I'm just new to the app, I downloaded it just to see how many days I am delayed before my period returned, and I know not to rely on the app.

 Is it possible that my ovulation is on the way? I don't have access to ovulation strips. And I know because of my irregularities it's hard to pinpoint my exact ovulation. 

Im just stressing because I just had a period last week and im cramping here real bad. and, I had unprotected sex just months ago but I got a period after that sex, so I'm having anxiety and pregnancy scares, and im still indenial even though i got a period after that and my period returned after a long absence. because of the videos and stories I've seen on TikTok. üòÖ

I see you waking
like a flower unfurling,
eyes still wrapped in dreams,
a soft morning kiss lingering on your lips.
The world hums gently around you‚Äî
coffee steaming,
your home breathing in rhythm,
a love you built
from the ashes of doubt.

You stand beside someone who whispers promises
in the language of action,
who holds your hand through the storm,
who sees you,
not as a puzzle to fix,
but a masterpiece to cherish.
Together, you create a sanctuary‚Äî
where comfort lives in every corner,
and laughter echoes
through rooms you once built with fear.

But it‚Äôs you,
most of all,
who rebuilt yourself.
You found your joy
in the smallest things‚Äî
sunlight warming your face,
the quiet hum of a day well-spent,
the magic of simply being.
You stopped running from the pain
and let it teach you how to rise,
how to soften,
how to love yourself in the silence.

You‚Äôve become someone who doesn‚Äôt just survive‚Äî
you thrive.
You stopped settling for shadows,
choosing instead the wild freedom of peace,
the boldness of being loved,
the sweetness of letting go.
The loneliness you once feared
has transformed,
a quiet companion,
whispering secrets only the strong can hear.
And in its place,
you‚Äôve learned to dance with connection‚Äî
open, vulnerable, alive.

You survived the nights that tried to break you,
the days that seemed too heavy to bear,
the moments that whispered,
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never make it.‚Äù
But you‚Äôre here now‚Äî
a phoenix risen,
stronger, kinder,
and more you than ever before.

You are the woman I‚Äôve dreamed of,
but more than that,
you are the woman who made the dreams real.
You turned the ache of longing into strength,
the quiet whispers of hope
into a chorus of truth.

And though I‚Äôm still reaching for you,
I know that with every step I take,
I‚Äôm walking toward the life
you‚Äôve already begun to live‚Äî
a life rich with love,
with joy,
with peace.

So I‚Äôll keep moving forward‚Äî

with love wrapped around me like the morning sun,

we fought for

Anyway, I finish and realize there is no air freshener, no windows, and no exhaust fan.

If I walk out, everyone will see me and I'll be known as the one who killed the atmosphere (literally and figuratively).

To my surprise , no one was around at that particular moment so immediately speedwalk back to where my friend is. Safe!

Next thing I know, the owners are yelling and fucking PISSED, and someone blamed an innocent bystander for it, and gets kicked out while pleading that it wasn't them. I didn't say a word.

I quit drinking coffee about 7 months ago in preparation for a psychedelic (iboga) retreat. Even though I was only drinking 1-2 cups a day, the withdrawals were pretty brutal. 

After several months, I still felt like my energy had not fully returned. I considered going back to coffee, but had an upcoming vipassana meditation retreat and decided to stay off in preparation for that.

Now, it has been quite some time and I still feel like I was more productive drinking coffee. I never had an issue with it - no noticeable crash, and enjoyed the morning ritual (I've tried replacing it with decaf but it's just not the same).

I do notice an improvement in my sleep which is great, but I'm not sure if it makes up for the lack of energy/focus. I've read so many wondrous reports on here but I feel like I'm just not getting the benefits I hoped for. I have recently tried coffee 2-3 times a week, which is nice as a boost without building tolerance, but leaves me in a bit of an in between space. For the first 6 months I had 0 caffeine.

I have ADHD, and stimulants have always relaxed me even when they provide focus and energy. Not sure if that makes a difference. I took vyvanse for many years but stopped that about a year and a half ago.

Anyways, I have mostly made peace with returning to a little coffee or tea every day. However, it was so hard to quit that I want to make sure I feel good about the decision before going back. Any thoughts? ",2,1744914940.0,Biohackers,7,1.0,False

I quit drinking coffee about 7 months ago in preparation for a psychedelic (iboga) retreat. Even though I was only drinking 1-2 cups a day, the withdrawals were pretty brutal. 

After several months, I still felt like my energy had not fully returned. I considered going back to coffee, but had an upcoming vipassana meditation retreat and decided to stay off in preparation for that.

Now, it has been quite some time and I still feel like I was more productive drinking coffee. I never had an issue with it - no noticeable crash, and enjoyed the morning ritual (I've tried replacing it with decaf but it's just not the same).

I do notice an improvement in my sleep which is great, but I'm not sure if it makes up for the lack of energy/focus. I've read so many wondrous reports on here but I feel like I'm just not getting the benefits I hoped for. I have recently tried coffee 2-3 times a week, which is nice as a boost without building tolerance, but leaves me in a bit of an in between space. For the first 6 months I had 0 caffeine.

I have ADHD, and stimulants have always relaxed me even when they provide focus and energy. Not sure if that makes a difference. I took vyvanse for many years but stopped that about a year and a half ago.

Anyways, I have mostly made peace with returning to a little coffee or tea every day. However, it was so hard to quit that I want to make sure I feel good about the decision before going back. Any thoughts? ",2,1744914865.0,decaf,4,1.0,False

I have just started a new relationship. We‚Äôve been together for three months and everything was doing great. We‚Äôve been seeing each other almost every day, she knows my family already and we‚Äôve been sharing some pretty intimate stuff. This relationship has been emotional since the beginning, it‚Äôs like she unlocked something inside me and I can be vulnerable without fear of judgment. I feel very loved and appreciated and since it‚Äôs my first lesbian relationship, I finally feel connected to myself and my own truth. 

The thing is, we don‚Äôt share the same religious beliefs. I‚Äôm an agnostic with Buddhist tendencies and she is a spiritist, and I was honestly OK with that when we first started seeing each other but now for some reason that‚Äôs all I can think about. She often says she has to come back to practicing her religion since she‚Äôs been kind of away from it because and, if she doesn‚Äôt, she‚Äôs gonna start having bad dreams and her energy is gonna be low and etc. Every time she mentions going back to it I feel really weird. It‚Äôs a real physical feeling in my stomach. 

I‚Äôve been feeling like this since she told me something about her past relationship. It was a really toxic one and she was always on edge, crying and fighting and I don‚Äôt think the same thing would happen with us, but I still can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. When she started dating her ex, the ex‚Äòs mother had just passed away, like, six months prior to the beginning of their relationship. One day, they were at the coffee table at her house and she (my current gf) started crying and screaming, feeling really anxious. Then, she claims the ex‚Äòs mother started talking through her, and she said a bunch of stuff to her ex, who naturally got frightened and left. She says it wasn‚Äôt her fault and that she had no control over it. The girl‚Äôs mother died on a tragic event and it was very recent, so every time I stop to think about it it really gives me the ick. Firstly because I don‚Äôt believe her and her powers, and secondly because if I was her ex, I would definitely break up right there and then. 

She also says she hates going to funerals or cemeteries because the dead often speak to her. Last month, one of our old neighbors died and a few days before his death she told me she was not feeling well and that she felt it had to do with energy. When the man died she told me she couldn‚Äôt have said it to me a week before, but she knew he was going to die and that she had to go to the funeral because he was actually wandering around her house with very confused feelings and she had to guide him onto the other side. üôÑ

I could say I wanna believe her, but that would be a lie because I am not at all interested in any of this.

Her thinking she can talk to her dead neighbor kind of worries me a little, but I can deal with it.

1k1jxqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/GREhelp/comments/1k1jxqb/how_to_use_gre_practice_tests_effectively_for/,How to Use GRE Practice Tests Effectively for Maximum Score Improvement,"Taking a practice test is something you don‚Äôt just do at the outset, but rather you need to integrate practice tests into your GRE prep.

You want to stagger practice tests in specific intervals, giving you enough time to review your mistakes on each test. Doing so will allow you to course correct which concepts to focus on, while highlighting any test-taking areas to improve on. For example, if you consistently run out of time on Reading Comprehension, that‚Äôs a sign to work on pacing strategies and perhaps change how you‚Äôre reading passages. If you‚Äôre consistently missing Geometry questions, then it‚Äôs time to brush up on key concepts.

How you take a GRE practice test can also make a critical difference. Do you relax into it, treat yourself to coffee and a bagel in between sections? That might sound enticing, but you‚Äôll want to simulate the test day experience as much as possible. That means taking the test in one sitting, under standard timing, and in a quiet environment. The closer your practice conditions match the real thing, the more useful the feedback will be.

Now you might also be wondering how many practice tests you need to take before exam day. The answer can vary depending on your situation. If your test date is six weeks away, one test every 10 to 14 days might be a good cadence. If your test is closer, you might take one per week. 

Finally, you might be asking yourself whether practice tests can really prepare you for the questions you‚Äôll see test day. After all, isn‚Äôt the real GRE test harder than practice tests? The short answer is no. ETS practice tests, in particular, aren‚Äôt designed to be easier than the real GRE test. So, if you treat your practice tests seriously and review them carefully, they can be an incredibly powerful tool for building test-day readiness.

Reach out to me with any questions about your GRE prep. Happy studying!

It was still under warranty so I took it to the Apple store. The lady who helped me was very nice and ran diagnostics. Everything passed, they‚Äôre weren‚Äôt any issues.

Like most of my trans mates, I've been throwing everything into fighting back against the transphobia sweeping the country. We're already deep in lefty circles and this kind of work, so it's nothing new - just exhausting, necessary, and occasionally validating if we're lucky (which is rare).

But what really does my head in? My non-cis friends (especially the straight ones) who are just... switched off. No protests, no emails to their MP, no activism at all. Even my bi girlfriend can't be arsed. And sometimes I think about how I'm the only trans person most of them know. Would they even give this much of a shit if I wasn't here? They'd still be allies, sure, but the implication is uncomfortable. It's such a Sally Bowles mentality most of them have.

Outside my activist bubble, I'm usually the only one pushing politically. They've got the time and means- they just don't care enough to use them. This isn't some theoretical debate. It's our lives being debated by cunts who want us gone. So why is everyone so fucking complacent?

I get activism's draining. The police are bastards, and I've lost count of the abuse I've copped just for showing up to even the most peaceful of demos. Not everyone can go full-throttle, and that's fair enough. But it stings when people I love treat this like it's just background noise while I'm living it every day, especially when I've got mates with far more time and privilege than myself, who won't even share a fundraiser or turn up to one demo. Instagram stories aren't enough. We need bodies, otherwise there's no point at all.

Yes, they are allies. They correct pronouns, help with my transition, have my back when bigots come at me irl. I don't doubt they care. But when it comes to the bigger fight- protests, lobbying, collective action- they're off getting coffee whilst me and the people this actually affects are the ones forced to go out marching. Just caring isn't enough when they won't lift a finger against the systems making our lives harder. Right now it feels like they're all too happy to leave the fighting to people like me, and that hurts. It's not about being some perfect activist, it's about doing something.

before i get into what happened, let me give you some context. five months ago, i was dating a different guy, let‚Äôs call him steven (22m). steven and i only dated for a month before i called things off after i caught him cheating by making a new tinder account behind my back. to this day, i still wonder why he did it. was i ugly? too nice? too clingy? i won‚Äôt ever understand. ryan is aware of this and he‚Äôs been great at tending to my needs and listening to me.

well that was until monday. ryan and i were walking into a cafe at our university to get some coffee before our night class and we saw steven. i pointed him out because ryan wanted to know what he looked like and i immediately held ryan‚Äôs hand when i saw him. honestly, i just wanted to rub it in steven‚Äôs face that i am happy and that i could find someone even better than his sorry self. we went in the cafe, everything was fine, and then we walked out and i kept talking about steven. ryan then snapped and said ‚Äúyou know you don‚Äôt need to react every time you see him.‚Äù i shut down and replied by saying, ‚Äúokay, i‚Äôll stop talking‚Äù before getting to class and going to the bathroom to cry. i was upset because he brought up something i am insecure about: not being over a cheater. i went back inside the classroom and eventually we talked it out. apparently, ryan was really hurt when i held his hand in front of steven because he thought me liking him was too good to be true. he also got upset whenever i talked about steven himself, but not when i talked about how he made me feel, because it brings up feelings of inadequacy for him and that he isn‚Äôt a good boyfriend. i apologized and admitted that what i did was wrong and we both agreed to move on from it.

well, i‚Äôm having a hard time moving on from it. i‚Äôm still hurt that ryan called me out for being a bad person and pointing out something i‚Äôm insecure about. i keep asking ryan if he‚Äôs mad at me and he always replies by saying, ‚Äúwe talked about it and moved past it. i don‚Äôt think about it anymore.‚Äù he also emphasized that he didn‚Äôt want to give up on me because he is in love with me. i just don‚Äôt understand why. i also feel like he‚Äôs going to use this against me. 

ryan has gotten really upset by these comments of mine. he‚Äôs now gotten extremely firm by saying ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre really not gonna try to move on, then I‚Äôm not gonna talk about this any more.

I'll make it short, my sleep is the worst it's ever been, it used to be bad but now it bothers me. I'll make bullet points to make it easier:

\- If I go to bed before 11, i WILL wake up during the night and unable to fall back asleep, basically my brain treats it as a nap. That's annoying but def can live with it.

\- When I do go to bed at 11, I always, always wake up around 3 am, usually able to fall back asleep, which I can deal with but probably not optimal

\- My biggest issue though is definitely that I ALWAYS wake up at around 7 am and it pisses me off. It's vacations right now and I'll sometimes sleep at 2 am, 4 am, 5 am and wake up at 7 am while never being able to sleep again after that while I could chill till like 11 am but just can't sleep beyond that..

\- I don't take naps, I workout 6 days a week (morning or 5pm always, never before bed or after dinner) , my nutrition is as healthy as it can be. Tho i'm a big overthinker, and off a break up. However it was still terrible before, only I could handle it, so it's not as simple as this. I started taking melatonin and magnesium byglicinate like a week ago, I think it helps falling asleep but the quality of my sleep is still terrible. I don't drink any coffee. 

  
\- I always chill in my bed to watch stuff or study things on my phone. sometimes can be all day when i don't work. I have a couch so it's a change I could make but def less comfort. Would that help you think? Other things that are bad that I can think of is I'm always watching stuff before trying to sleep on my phone, would switching that to a book make a difference? 

  
Think I said everything I think was relevant, would greatly appreciate any advice or thoughts. Much love and stay blessed.

I‚Äôm Riley. I‚Äôm a 33 year old middle school math teacher.   I have some time now that my work is done and I figured I‚Äôd have a coffee or three (addicted) and hang‚Ä¶hopefully with company.

I just bought a car. It‚Äôs my first new car so that has been exciting.  


I suppose I am looking for someone interesting, confident, bold and simply able to carry on a conversation. We can chat today only or maybe it last longer‚Ä¶whatever happens is cool.

Before roasting, I went to school for Computer Science. I have always just used an excel sheet to input orders, calculate roasting numbers, keep track of what's been shipped, inventory, etc. I have begun to develop a web application that will streamline all of this for roasters of any size.

Looking around and doing research it seems like most roasters either use some form on an Excel sheet like myself, or pay for Cropster with Production Management capabilities (cheapest tier is $99/mo).

I wanted to come on here and ask if you guys think there is a market for an application like this. A ""Roasting Production Management Software"" that takes in orders, calculates roasting numbers, bag and label numbers, and ground coffee numbers. It would designate which orders need to be shipped, delivered, or picked up. And would also track inventory and alert you when things needed to be re-ordered.

Since this program wouldn't have anything to do with the actual roasting, I am hoping to be able to deliver this software at a much more reasonable price (maybe somewhere around $20/mo). Especially for us folks that don't pay for Cropster to track our actual roasts.

I would love to hear any and all feedback, and also any suggestions on what you would like to see on an application like this! Happy roasting!",1,1744913843.0,roasting,4,0.67,False

I‚Äôve been through my fair share of digestive problems and constant health issues.

**My Struggle Before PrimeBiome**

Let me start by telling you a bit about my struggles before PrimeBiome. For years, I suffered from constant bloating after every meal. I would eat a healthy meal, only to feel so uncomfortable afterward that it affected my entire day. On top of that, my energy levels were all over the place. One moment, I‚Äôd feel somewhat okay, but within an hour or two, I‚Äôd crash. My skin was dull, and I had frequent breakouts, which I later realized were likely connected to my gut health.

I had always heard that gut health was important, but I didn‚Äôt realize how much it impacted not just digestion, but everything else: my immune system, energy, mood, and even the way my skin looked. I tried over-the-counter digestive aids, fiber supplements, and a variety of probiotics, but nothing gave me the relief I needed. I was starting to lose hope that I‚Äôd ever feel truly good again.

**Finding PrimeBiome**

That‚Äôs when I heard about PrimeBiome. A close friend of mine, who‚Äôs a nutritionist, recommended it to me. She explained that PrimeBiome wasn‚Äôt just another probiotic ‚Äî it‚Äôs a complete gut health solution that combines a powerful blend of probiotics and prebiotics to nourish your gut microbiome, improve digestion, and help with many other aspects of health.

Intrigued, I decided to give it a try. I was skeptical, of course, but I was desperate for a change. After reading up on the ingredients and the science behind the product, I figured I had nothing to lose.

**My First Month on PrimeBiome**

I started with the recommended dosage of one capsule per day, first thing in the morning with a glass of water. The instructions were clear and simple, which I appreciated. I wasn‚Äôt expecting a miracle overnight, but after the first few days, I started to notice something different.

**Day 3:** I began to feel a noticeable reduction in bloating. After meals, my stomach didn‚Äôt feel tight or uncomfortable. For the first time in ages, I could actually eat a meal without feeling like I‚Äôd just stuffed myself. My energy levels also seemed to improve slightly. It wasn‚Äôt a massive surge of energy, but I wasn‚Äôt experiencing that mid-afternoon slump anymore.

**Day 7:** By the end of the first week, I was starting to feel genuinely different. The bloating I‚Äôd dealt with for years was almost completely gone. My digestion was smoother, and I noticed that I wasn‚Äôt running to the bathroom as frequently or dealing with that post-meal fatigue. But the real surprise came when I realized my mood was better. I felt less irritable and more at ease, which was a huge shift for me.

**Day 14:** By the second week, the changes became even more apparent. I had more sustained energy throughout the day. I woke up feeling more rested, and I didn‚Äôt need coffee to get through the morning anymore. My mental clarity was noticeably sharper. No more brain fog or foggy mornings. On top of that, my skin started looking brighter and healthier. I couldn‚Äôt believe how quickly the results started to show!

**Day 30:** A month in, I was blown away. My digestion had improved to the point where I could eat without worrying about feeling bloated or uncomfortable. My skin had cleared up, and I noticed fewer breakouts. I was sleeping better, and I was waking up with more energy. My immune system felt stronger, and I was no longer falling sick as often. It felt like my body was finally working with me, not against me.

**What Makes PrimeBiome Stand Out?**

**Now, you might be wondering:** ‚ÄúWhat makes PrimeBiome so different from all the other probiotics out there?‚Äù Trust me, I had the same question. Here's what sets PrimeBiome apart:

**Comprehensive Formula:** PrimeBiome isn‚Äôt just a basic probiotic; it‚Äôs a complete gut health solution. It contains 9 powerful strains of probiotics, each with a specific role in supporting a healthy gut. But it‚Äôs not just the probiotics that make the difference ‚Äî it also includes prebiotics to help those probiotics thrive. Prebiotics are the food that probiotics need to grow, so this dual-action approach is far more effective than many single-strain probiotics on the market.

**Proven Strains:** The strains in PrimeBiome, such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium longum, have been extensively studied for their effectiveness in supporting digestive health, reducing bloating, and improving mood and mental clarity. These aren‚Äôt just trendy ingredients ‚Äî they‚Äôve been proven to work in clinical trials.

**Gut-Immune System Connection:** PrimeBiome‚Äôs unique formulation doesn‚Äôt just focus on digestion. It also supports a healthy immune system. A healthy gut microbiome is crucial for a strong immune system, and PrimeBiome works to boost both. This is why I‚Äôve noticed fewer colds and illnesses since starting it.

**No Fillers or Additives:** One of the things I love most about PrimeBiome is that it contains no unnecessary fillers, chemicals, or artificial ingredients. What you see on the label is what you get: pure, high-quality probiotics and prebiotics that work.

**Spore-Forming Technology:** PrimeBiome uses spore-forming probiotics, which are designed to survive through the harsh conditions of the stomach and reach your gut intact. This makes it far more effective than many other probiotics that don‚Äôt survive the digestive process.

**The Results Speak for Themselves**

In just one month, PrimeBiome transformed the way I feel. My digestion is better, I have more energy, my skin is glowing, and I‚Äôm in a better mood overall. This is not just about feeling okay ‚Äî this is about feeling amazing.

I‚Äôve tried countless supplements in the past, but PrimeBiome has been the first one to deliver on its promises. It‚Äôs not a gimmick or a quick fix. It‚Äôs a well-researched, scientifically-backed product that delivers real, lasting results.

**Why You Should Buy PrimeBiome Now**

If you‚Äôre struggling with digestive issues, low energy, or skin problems like I was, I can‚Äôt recommend PrimeBiome enough. This product will change the way you feel from the inside out. The best part is that it works naturally with your body to help restore balance and improve your overall health ‚Äî without relying on harsh chemicals or stimulants.

Don‚Äôt waste any more time trying products that don‚Äôt work. PrimeBiome is the real deal, and I guarantee you‚Äôll feel the difference within just a few weeks of taking it.

She explained that PrimeBiome wasn‚Äôt just another probiotic ‚Äî it‚Äôs a complete gut health solution that combines a powerful blend of probiotics and prebiotics to nourish your gut microbiome, improve digestion, and help with many other aspects of health.

Intrigued, I decided to give it a try. I was skeptical, of course, but I was desperate for a change. After reading up on the ingredients and the science behind the product, I figured I had nothing to lose.

**My First Month on PrimeBiome**

I started with the recommended dosage of one capsule per day, first thing in the morning with a glass of water. The instructions were clear and simple, which I appreciated. I wasn‚Äôt expecting a miracle overnight, but after the first few days, I started to notice something different.

**Day 3:** I began to feel a noticeable reduction in bloating. After meals, my stomach didn‚Äôt feel tight or uncomfortable. For the first time in ages, I could actually eat a meal without feeling like I‚Äôd just stuffed myself. My energy levels also seemed to improve slightly. It wasn‚Äôt a massive surge of energy, but I wasn‚Äôt experiencing that mid-afternoon slump anymore.

**Day 7:** By the end of the first week, I was starting to feel genuinely different. The bloating I‚Äôd dealt with for years was almost completely gone. My digestion was smoother, and I noticed that I wasn‚Äôt running to the bathroom as frequently or dealing with that post-meal fatigue. But the real surprise came when I realized my mood was better. I felt less irritable and more at ease, which was a huge shift for me.

**Day 14:** By the second week, the changes became even more apparent. I had more sustained energy throughout the day. I woke up feeling more rested, and I didn‚Äôt need coffee to get through the morning anymore. My mental clarity was noticeably sharper. No more brain fog or foggy mornings. On top of that, my skin started looking brighter and healthier. I couldn‚Äôt believe how quickly the results started to show!

**Day 30:** A month in, I was blown away. My digestion had improved to the point where I could eat without worrying about feeling bloated or uncomfortable. My skin had cleared up, and I noticed fewer breakouts. I was sleeping better, and I was waking up with more energy. My immune system felt stronger, and I was no longer falling sick as often. It felt like my body was finally working with me, not against me.

**What Makes PrimeBiome Stand Out?**

**Now, you might be wondering:** ‚ÄúWhat makes PrimeBiome so different from all the other probiotics out there?‚Äù Trust me, I had the same question. Here's what sets PrimeBiome apart:

**Comprehensive Formula:** PrimeBiome isn‚Äôt just a basic probiotic; it‚Äôs a complete gut health solution. It contains 9 powerful strains of probiotics, each with a specific role in supporting a healthy gut. But it‚Äôs not just the probiotics that make the difference ‚Äî it also includes prebiotics to help those probiotics thrive. Prebiotics are the food that probiotics need to grow, so this dual-action approach is far more effective than many single-strain probiotics on the market.

**Proven Strains:** The strains in PrimeBiome, such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium longum, have been extensively studied for their effectiveness in supporting digestive health, reducing bloating, and improving mood and mental clarity. These aren‚Äôt just trendy ingredients ‚Äî they‚Äôve been proven to work in clinical trials.

**Gut-Immune System Connection:** PrimeBiome‚Äôs unique formulation doesn‚Äôt just focus on digestion. It also supports a healthy immune system. A healthy gut microbiome is crucial for a strong immune system, and PrimeBiome works to boost both. This is why I‚Äôve noticed fewer colds and illnesses since starting it.

**No Fillers or Additives:** One of the things I love most about PrimeBiome is that it contains no unnecessary fillers, chemicals, or artificial ingredients. What you see on the label is what you get: pure, high-quality probiotics and prebiotics that work.

**Spore-Forming Technology:** PrimeBiome uses spore-forming probiotics, which are designed to survive through the harsh conditions of the stomach and reach your gut intact. This makes it far more effective than many other probiotics that don‚Äôt survive the digestive process.

**The Results Speak for Themselves**

In just one month, PrimeBiome transformed the way I feel. My digestion is better, I have more energy, my skin is glowing, and I‚Äôm in a better mood overall. This is not just about feeling okay ‚Äî this is about feeling amazing.

I‚Äôve tried countless supplements in the past, but PrimeBiome has been the first one to deliver on its promises. It‚Äôs not a gimmick or a quick fix. It‚Äôs a well-researched, scientifically-backed product that delivers real, lasting results.

**Why You Should Buy PrimeBiome Now**

If you‚Äôre struggling with digestive issues, low energy, or skin problems like I was, I can‚Äôt recommend PrimeBiome enough. This product will change the way you feel from the inside out. The best part is that it works naturally with your body to help restore balance and improve your overall health ‚Äî without relying on harsh chemicals or stimulants.

Don‚Äôt waste any more time trying products that don‚Äôt work. PrimeBiome is the real deal, and I guarantee you‚Äôll feel the difference within just a few weeks of taking it.

**My Struggle Before PrimeBiome**

Let me start by telling you a bit about my struggles before PrimeBiome. For years, I suffered from constant bloating after every meal. I would eat a healthy meal, only to feel so uncomfortable afterward that it affected my entire day. On top of that, my energy levels were all over the place. One moment, I‚Äôd feel somewhat okay, but within an hour or two, I‚Äôd crash. My skin was dull, and I had frequent breakouts, which I later realized were likely connected to my gut health.

I had always heard that gut health was important, but I didn‚Äôt realize how much it impacted not just digestion, but everything else: my immune system, energy, mood, and even the way my skin looked. I tried over-the-counter digestive aids, fiber supplements, and a variety of probiotics, but nothing gave me the relief I needed. I was starting to lose hope that I‚Äôd ever feel truly good again.

A healthy gut microbiome is crucial for a strong immune system, and PrimeBiome works to boost both. This is why I‚Äôve noticed fewer colds and illnesses since starting it.

**No Fillers or Additives:** One of the things I love most about PrimeBiome is that it contains no unnecessary fillers, chemicals, or artificial ingredients. What you see on the label is what you get: pure, high-quality probiotics and prebiotics that work.

**Spore-Forming Technology:** PrimeBiome uses spore-forming probiotics, which are designed to survive through the harsh conditions of the stomach and reach your gut intact. This makes it far more effective than many other probiotics that don‚Äôt survive the digestive process.

In just one month, PrimeBiome transformed the way I feel. My digestion is better, I have more energy, my skin is glowing, and I‚Äôm in a better mood overall. This is not just about feeling okay ‚Äî this is about feeling amazing.

**My Struggle Before PrimeBiome**

Let me start by telling you a bit about my struggles before PrimeBiome. For years, I suffered from constant bloating after every meal. I would eat a healthy meal, only to feel so uncomfortable afterward that it affected my entire day. On top of that, my energy levels were all over the place. One moment, I‚Äôd feel somewhat okay, but within an hour or two, I‚Äôd crash. My skin was dull, and I had frequent breakouts, which I later realized were likely connected to my gut health.

I had always heard that gut health was important, but I didn‚Äôt realize how much it impacted not just digestion, but everything else: my immune system, energy, mood, and even the way my skin looked. I tried over-the-counter digestive aids, fiber supplements, and a variety of probiotics, but nothing gave me the relief I needed. I was starting to lose hope that I‚Äôd ever feel truly good again.

**Finding PrimeBiome**

That‚Äôs when I heard about PrimeBiome. A close friend of mine, who‚Äôs a nutritionist, recommended it to me. She explained that PrimeBiome wasn‚Äôt just another probiotic ‚Äî it‚Äôs a complete gut health solution that combines a powerful blend of probiotics and prebiotics to nourish your gut microbiome, improve digestion, and help with many other aspects of health.

Intrigued, I decided to give it a try. I was skeptical, of course, but I was desperate for a change. After reading up on the ingredients and the science behind the product, I figured I had nothing to lose.

**My First Month on PrimeBiome**

I started with the recommended dosage of one capsule per day, first thing in the morning with a glass of water. The instructions were clear and simple, which I appreciated. I wasn‚Äôt expecting a miracle overnight, but after the first few days, I started to notice something different.

**Day 3:** I began to feel a noticeable reduction in bloating. After meals, my stomach didn‚Äôt feel tight or uncomfortable. For the first time in ages, I could actually eat a meal without feeling like I‚Äôd just stuffed myself. My energy levels also seemed to improve slightly. It wasn‚Äôt a massive surge of energy, but I wasn‚Äôt experiencing that mid-afternoon slump anymore.

**Day 7:** By the end of the first week, I was starting to feel genuinely different. The bloating I‚Äôd dealt with for years was almost completely gone. My digestion was smoother, and I noticed that I wasn‚Äôt running to the bathroom as frequently or dealing with that post-meal fatigue. But the real surprise came when I realized my mood was better. I felt less irritable and more at ease, which was a huge shift for me.

**Day 14:** By the second week, the changes became even more apparent. I had more sustained energy throughout the day. I woke up feeling more rested, and I didn‚Äôt need coffee to get through the morning anymore. My mental clarity was noticeably sharper. No more brain fog or foggy mornings. On top of that, my skin started looking brighter and healthier. I couldn‚Äôt believe how quickly the results started to show!

**Day 30:** A month in, I was blown away. My digestion had improved to the point where I could eat without worrying about feeling bloated or uncomfortable. My skin had cleared up, and I noticed fewer breakouts. I was sleeping better, and I was waking up with more energy. My immune system felt stronger, and I was no longer falling sick as often. It felt like my body was finally working with me, not against me.

**What Makes PrimeBiome Stand Out?**

**Now, you might be wondering:** ‚ÄúWhat makes PrimeBiome so different from all the other probiotics out there?‚Äù Trust me, I had the same question. Here's what sets PrimeBiome apart:

**Comprehensive Formula:** PrimeBiome isn‚Äôt just a basic probiotic; it‚Äôs a complete gut health solution. It contains 9 powerful strains of probiotics, each with a specific role in supporting a healthy gut. But it‚Äôs not just the probiotics that make the difference ‚Äî it also includes prebiotics to help those probiotics thrive. Prebiotics are the food that probiotics need to grow, so this dual-action approach is far more effective than many single-strain probiotics on the market.

**Proven Strains:** The strains in PrimeBiome, such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium longum, have been extensively studied for their effectiveness in supporting digestive health, reducing bloating, and improving mood and mental clarity. These aren‚Äôt just trendy ingredients ‚Äî they‚Äôve been proven to work in clinical trials.

We delivered a fridge to this woman, she was very nice and talkative with us. Fairly attractive woman and looking around her house you could just tell she was single.  Looked up her FB and that‚Äôs pretty much confirmed. I‚Äôm looking to make a move and perhaps get a coffee date. 
So I have her number since we have to call and let them know we‚Äôre on the way.  And obviously her address as well.  
So the question is- what would be the best approach?  Send a text? Just cold call?  Or maybe drop a note in her mailbox etc. Knock on the door with flowers in hand? Like I said she was nice, and seemed like she might be down. ",0,1744913591.0,Advice,3,0.5,False
