1jyq4sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jyq4sv/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_dads_cancer/,AITA for refusing to pay for my ‚Äúdads‚Äù cancer treatments after they legally abandoned me?,"I know this is going to get mixed feedback but I feel like I need other opinions right now. I (33f) haven‚Äôt talked to my ‚Äúparents‚Äù since I was 16 when they abandoned me. My childhood was completely devoid of love, Haley and Aaron (this is what I call them because they are not my parents) didn‚Äôt want a girl and when I was born they didn‚Äôt hide their disappointment. They both went through the steps of parenting but no emotion was behind it, from the age of 3 they put me in dance lessons that I went to every day, often for at least five hours, it was where they put me so they wouldn‚Äôt have to see me. When I started school my house became just the place I slept. I didn‚Äôt have many friends either because dance was my entire life, and even if I had free time Haley and Aaron would refuse to drive me anywhere. This is how my childhood went for 12 years. Then Haley got pregnant with Jack, he was who they had been waiting for this whole time. They acted completely different, not towards me but towards the world, they laughed more, cooked more and seemed happier, but none of this was given to me. When Jack came they stopped paying for dance, I was devastated because it was my life, they told me the money was for Jack now. Instead I started spending time in my room, because I always was in the way when I left for anything but the bathroom. This was my life for four years. A week before my 16th birthday they asked me to have dinner with them, i had no idea what it was for because I haven‚Äôt eaten dinner with them once in my entire memory, even for thanksgiving I was on my own. I was nervous but I was also excited thinking that maybe they would notice me, I was very wrong. We went to a restaurant and my parents pulled out a big envelope filled with paper work. ‚ÄúHave you ever heard of emancipation?‚Äù Aaron asked me. I hadn‚Äôt so they began to tell me that once I was 16 I could separate from them legally and live on my own. I was confused at how that would work, I‚Äôd never been allowed to have a job and I didn‚Äôt have any money. Aaron and Haley told me they had filled out most of the documents and that we could set a hearing date for approval. I asked them where I would stay and with what money, they told me there was an account they set up in my name when I was younger and they‚Äôve been saving it for this moment. They told me they would help me find a place and move and get a job, they were so dead set on this and when I voiced my concern they told me I was ungrateful. It was clear I had no choice, and with all their documentation the process went smoothly and I was emancipated very quickly after I turned 16. The day after the hearing I got home from school and there were two large suitcases on the porch, I went up to the door and it was locked and my key wasn‚Äôt working, I tried the garage code but that was also changed, finally I knocked on the door. Haley and Aaron came out smiling and I could hear Jack through the door. They stepped outside and close the door behind them, I asked what was going on and they told me that I couldn‚Äôt live with them anymore. I was confused and told them I had no money and that they agreed to help me find a place. ‚ÄúWell you aren‚Äôt our child so we don‚Äôt want you here, you aren‚Äôt our responsibility.‚Äù Aaron got angrier the more he spoke and when he finished I asked if they were really doing this. Haley said they‚Äôve been wanting to do this for years and with that they went inside and dead-bolted the door behind them. I stood on the porch for a while before I decided I had to figure stuff out, I spent 16 years alone I could do this, after all they weren‚Äôt my parents. I hid my bags in the alley behind my old dance studio and went to the park nearby where I found bushes to sleep in. The next day I got on the school bus and went to drop out, the admin were confused but with my age and emancipation they couldn‚Äôt stop me. I spent the rest of the day applying to every job I could find. I ended up with three jobs, working 80 hour weeks at a coffee stand, restaurant and a 24 hour diner. I made a deal with two of the jobs to ignore the labor laws to get paid extra hours under the table. I busted my ass and spent every waking moment working, I got a cheap gym membership for the showers and after six months of work I was able to get a small and crappy apartment on the wrong side of town. I lived like this for three more years and when I was 19 I had enough money to move to the other side of the country. I moved to New York and got another tiny sketchy apartment and changed my last name to something generic but I felt more like myself than I ever had before. I started working two jobs and when I had settled in more and had the funds I decided to try ballet again. All of my former training came back and I got good again, and fast. What was fun turned into my passion, I knew I wanted to make it my job so I did. It took years but when I was 26 I got accepted into the American Ballet Theatre, the best in the country. I was good and kept getting better, I stared in lead rolls often and during one show about a year after joining I got paired with Spencer (35m) for a show and we clicked, he asked me out after a week and we‚Äôve been together ever since. He proposed after three years and we got married shortly after. We have a little girl together who is now a year old and the light of our lives. Spencer and I are both principal dancers now and very successful and happy. I am living a life filled with more joy than I thought possible as a kid. Everything was going well until two weeks ago, I was at work when one of the receptionists came and pulled me out of class. She told me that my parents were there and I told her that wasn‚Äôt possible, but then Haley came rushing down the hall with Aaron behind her, both of them beaming. Haley hugged me which I did not return, to be clear this is the only hug she‚Äôs ever given me in my life. I turned to the receptionist and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have parents and I don‚Äôt know who these people are, please have them leave or I will talk to security.‚Äù  Haley looked like I‚Äôd punch her and Aaron looked at his shoes. I just turned back around and went to class. Spencer noticed something was off and asked what‚Äôs wrong so I told him, he knew about my childhood, the emancipation and homelessness, he held me when I cried about having no one to walk me down the aisle, or when our baby was born, he knew the irreparable harm they caused me. When we left to go home we passed the coffee place right by ABT and for the second time I saw Haley and Aaron coming up to me. Haley said hi and that she missed me, I said nothing, then my dad turned to Spencer. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù He said with a raised eyebrow. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wondering the same thing‚Äù Spence responded. ‚ÄúIm her dad!‚Äù Aaron said, I was going to step in to deny that claim but Spence beat me to it, ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt have a father.‚Äù ‚ÄúEveryone has a father.‚Äù Aaron insisted. ‚ÄúNo I assure you she doesn‚Äôt, her father would have been at our wedding, and met our daughter, and I haven‚Äôt even met you so I am certain you aren‚Äôt her dad.‚Äù Haley gasped when he said that, and they both turned to me, speaking over each other asking why I never told them about my wedding and my daughter. ‚ÄúIm not doing this.‚Äù I said before tugging Spencer‚Äôs hand and walking away. That night we discussed what I wanted to do, I never want them back in my life I know for sure but I am also really curious what brought them back because I am certain it wasn‚Äôt a relationship with me. I told him that if we saw them again I‚Äôd set a time to talk to them with him and we‚Äôll go from there. He agreed and we went to bed but the next morning as we are walking to ABT they are again sitting at the coffee shop next door. They both stood up and started walking towards me and despite what I said the night before I wasn‚Äôt in the mood. Haley approached first but before she could get a word in I told her to shut up and then turned and went to continue but Aaron said ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt talk to your mother like that.‚Äù All I did was laugh and continue forward, Spencer laughed as well and I am so grateful that he is here with me. The day went without any more interruption and when Spence and I left they were still at the coffee shop but they didn‚Äôt approach this time and I barely glanced their way. The next morning again they were at the coffee place and again I walked straight past them. After work that night they were still there and I finally decided I had to deal with this, I walked up to them and asked what they wanted and why they were here. Haley started talking about how much they missed me and how the minute I left, yes they said that I left, they missed me and felt a hole in their lives. To just clarify a few things I continued living in Seattle for three years after they kicked me out and I saw them a few times while at work but they ignored me entirely. When I moved to NYC I was hard to find sure, but once I became a principal ballerina it was easy. Yes I changed my last name, and have again since the marriage, but it would take ten minutes of googling around to find me based on my old name, I tried once a few years ago out of curiosity. I asked what they really wanted and they swore up and down that it was just to rebuild out relationship, i had no desire to do that but I wanted to know what was so important that they had to find they‚Äôre ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù. I told them we can meet for dinner, I will pay and Spencer will be there, and we could go from there. The dinner happened two days later and I‚Äôm going to keep this as short as possible but a lot happened. We met and Haley tried to hug me but I put my hand up to stop her, she seemed sad but dealt with it as they both sat down at the table. They started with small talk asking me how I was doing, I kept my answers brief especially when they began to ask about my daughter. Aaron began to ask Spencer questions as well. About how we met and what he does, then Haley asks, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you invite us to the wedding?‚Äù I scoffed a bit before asking why they would expect an invite and Aaron responded that they were my parents. This pissed me off and I went on a bit of a tirade, ‚ÄúYou are not and will never be my parents, you told me that I wasn‚Äôt your daughter after forcing me to legally emancipate so you could abandon me without consequences. I slept in parks and under bridges for sixth months, I worked 80 hour weeks at three different places, and you let me. I moved myself to New York and became a dancer, a successful and talented principal dancer at one of the world‚Äôs best companies and I did it all without parents.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt loud but my words were sharp and they both shut up for a second. Aaron said he was sorry and that every day I was gone they missed me. Again I scoffed ‚ÄúI was living in the park down the street and worked at the coffee stand you went to every Sunday, you had every opportunity to find me and change what you did but you didn‚Äôt. Because you aren‚Äôt my parents, I mean nothing to you and you mean nothing to me.‚Äù Haley looked to be teary eyes but I really did not care. ‚ÄúWe know we messed up we want to change.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd why now?‚Äù They both looked at each other before Haley said ‚ÄúYour father‚Äù before Spencer cut him off and said ‚ÄúAaron.‚Äù They looked upset but Haley continued ‚ÄúAaron has cancer, and we aren‚Äôt sure what the future will look like but we have a different perspective now and came all this way to see you.‚Äù This immediately raised red flags for me, yes objectively that is sad but I felt absolutely nothing. ‚ÄúYou have cancer? What kind?‚Äù He replied that it was stage three colon cancer and his prognosis isn‚Äôt great but there are treatments that seem to be helping. This didn‚Äôt change anything to me, they did the unforgivable and I won‚Äôt be manipulated into a relationship by guilt. I simply nodded and let the silence hang, Haley looked at me and seemed pretty upset at my lack of reaction but couldn‚Äôt do anything. I asked them how Jack was, they told me he was okay and he was figuring himself out he wasn‚Äôt in college and doesn‚Äôt work and yet still they gush about him with so much pride. The dinner continued and we caught up a bit, they acted like real people and for once in my life seemed to be curious about my life. The dinner ended ok and I paid the bill and as I was getting up they asked to chat a little more, I was wary but sat down anyway. They started me asking questions like where we lived and how rent is so expensive in New York, then they asked about my job and if it was supporting me enough to which I told them that me and Spence are comfortable. I could tell where this was going, they needed money. I figured it out quicker than they thought and said ‚ÄúWhy do you want my money?‚Äù after Haley mentioned that the restaurant was really nice and they had never been somewhere so fancy. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want your money!‚Äù Haley said but Aaron turned and said, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want it we really need it.‚Äù I waited for him to continue and he told me that the cancer bills were overwhelming and that they can‚Äôt afford it anymore but if he doesn‚Äôt get the treatments he will die in the next year two. I told them both that they would not get any money from me as they were two strangers and told them to leave me alone. Haley burst out sobbing and begging as Aaron sat there livid. They asked if I would do this to my own father and for what felt like the hundredth time I told them that they were not my parents or my family and they certainly were not friends and I grabbed Spencer and we left. Haley was at the coffee place the next day and the minute she saw me she ran up. ‚ÄúI know we weren‚Äôt there for you but we want to change that. I want us to be there for each other and this can be a start.‚Äù I told her that I didn‚Äôt want them in my life and that would not be changing. They were both sitting there every morning and night since the dinner a week ago and they continue to pressure me, they shove letters in my hand and Haley cries every time i walk away. Spencer is with me wholeheartedly, he thinks Aaron deserves it and I‚Äôm inclined to agree, but mostly I don‚Äôt feel anything towards them I just want them to get out of my life. They haven‚Äôt been harassing me exactly, they remain pretty well mannered but I am done with the constant guilt trips. I‚Äôm starting to think that maybe I‚Äôm being wrong, that I should pay for them at least somewhat. It‚Äôs not that I feel bad but between me and my husband we are very well off and we could afford it. I don‚Äôt want a relationship I just want them to go away and if paying them will do then I can go back to them not existing. I don‚Äôt know what to do and am open to any advice",2,1744603598.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

1jyq2yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/OperationInsomnia/comments/1jyq2yk/an_occult_hunters_death_log_part_7/,An Occult Hunter's Death Log [Part 7],"Alright, we‚Äôre back. Well, not fully. Sort of-....

I‚Äôll explain.

It‚Äôs been a minute since the end of our mission to the Navajo Nation. Truth be told, opening the car door to my driveway has never felt more tranquil‚Ä¶ That was until I heard the passenger door swing open and I could hear every single vertebrae in Isaac‚Äôs back realign as he stretched. ‚ÄúAh, home-sweet-ranch-compound, huh Dwight?‚Äù. Yes for the foreseeable future, noting our long absence from each other and his seeming inability to recall the last better part of a decade, I‚Äôve elected Isaac can shack up at my place. Zeus has seemingly taking a liking to him, although truth be told that 90lb canine assault missile will take to just about anyone that will feed him.

Sorry back on track, we were looking at several weeks of downtime, which despite the fact that I should have been focused on recuperation‚Ä¶ I could only think of piecing together what‚Äôs been happening. It‚Äôs a flaw of mine, once I‚Äôm hooked I have to see something through to the end‚Ä¶ I guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm the maniac who didn‚Äôt run from the Cazamoth Estate and went to Afghanistan four separate times. Regardless we had some noncombat objective‚Ä¶ or so it seemed.

‚ÄúHey Dwight, you like decorating your house with hand prints?‚Äù Isaac quipped, my mind immediately thought back to the print indent I saw on the gutter and porch post. ‚ÄúYeah, don‚Äôt mind them, I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a thing‚Äù I said as I dragged my gear bag out of my trunk. Then something he said made the hair on the back of my neck stand up: ‚Äú... All of them?‚Äù. What did he mean ‚Äúall‚Äù of them? Well, I found out what he meant when I turned and‚Ä¶ on the wooden railing, the steps, doorway, at multiple points on the glass were more hand prints. Coating the front of the house‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd been gone for a few weeks, but this was new, this hadn‚Äôt happened before. I dropped my gear on the porch and looked at some of them, they were embedded just a few millimeters into the wood, the glass, even the stone‚Ä¶ just enough to be noticeable. All of them were human like, four fingers and a thumb, but‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. They were cave painting is, archaic, weird‚Ä¶ enigmatic.

Just like the traps that were warped and bent impossibly. Just like the hundred dead birds that passed inexplicably. ‚Ä¶ This was another probe.

The only thing greeting us besides the wind and Zeus‚Äô sniffing and growling at some of the prints was the silence, all eyes were on us‚Ä¶ That was until Isaac broke the air with an all too giddy: ‚ÄúDo you have a craving for property that‚Äôs got demonic intent or is this all just happenstance?‚Äù. Guess I‚Äôm just lucky.

Truth be told, getting used to Isaac again wasn‚Äôt too much of a challenge, to be honest between him and Zeus, having people around this place again was much better than absolute solitude. Though we had our fair share of weird moments, Zeus seems to be sticking to the area immediately around the house when he trots outside, there‚Äôs an eerie feeling I‚Äôve been getting everytime I take my ATV out and scout the lands. Isaac‚Äôs been telling me the ‚Äúwalls are talking‚Äù, though that may just be the alcohol. Like, a serious amount of alcohol, we‚Äôre out in an isolated part near the rockies, where does he get that much- nevermind, rambling again, just like old times. The knocking‚Ä¶ did I tell you guys about the knocking? Well, there‚Äôs knocking everytime I go to get the coffee. Sometimes its at a window, a wall, other times from the door, one day Isaac went to go confront it but I just told him: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt answer it‚Äù.

There‚Äôs some things in this world you just don‚Äôt mess with, and I‚Äôve got some hella‚Äô spiritual blood on my hands. It will always probably be ‚Äúweird‚Äù for the rest of my life, but I guess that‚Äôs just the parameters‚Ä¶ the hand I‚Äôve been dealt. Things were starting to get worse though‚Ä¶ coyotes started to show up dead. Now it‚Äôs not unusual for Zeus to embrace his canine apex predator instincts and chase them down, then drag them back to the house to enjoy his kill right where everyone including the mailman could see it. What was unusual was for a whole pack of them to be left right at the bottom of the front steps, gutted brutally to where they were all peeled and ripped open, their blood and innards painting the front of the damn house.

I remember nearly stepping in when we went to go check, door slowly opened as I kept my glock to my right, Isaac had elected to creep out a shotgun and scan the front. ‚ÄúOkay, yeah, this place is definitely screwed, you ever think about relocating?‚Äù he remarked. Even if I wanted to, I don‚Äôt think this is something you can run from‚Ä¶ I remember Zeus sniffing at the pile, only to back off and growl at it with his ears back refusing to eat any of it. We went to my office on the second floor where I had the entire property‚Äôs motion sensors, cameras, and surveillance set up‚Ä¶ it happened last night, although no motion sensors triggered it. We found the point of appearance and‚Ä¶ well.

2:17am; the porch is clear and everything is fine, night vision on my cameras gives us damn near a 360 view of the property and every inch of it from where the pavement turns to gravel, and then to grass. Then‚Ä¶ it all appeared instantaneously: the dead coyotes, the blood to the point where some of the lenses were even smeared, all of it. Isaac and I zoomed in on the exact millisecond, opening maybe there was some cut off or something to show what happened‚Ä¶. Nothing. .01: it‚Äôs not there, .02, all of it. Whatever did this, didn‚Äôt do it through conventional means.

‚ÄúWhat do you think it could mean?‚Äù Isaac asked, flipping through all of the cameras showing every angle of the carnage. I‚Äôll tell you what I told him‚Ä¶ something was sending a message, in the same way bodies are strung up at the front of bridges to ward off enemies this was the same thing. Isaac had a different theory, he pointed to an image of the pile: ‚ÄúThe blood is one thing, but the bodies? They seem to be in the form of an‚Ä¶ offering‚Äù.

I was dumbfounded and my face probably showed my confusion: ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù. My Idaho alcoholic went on to explain: ‚ÄúThink about it‚Ä¶ This is a crossroads, right, you got the Dakotas to our northish, west is red rock territory, south is Texas and Oklahoma, this is a merging area of all kinds of nasty shit, that‚Äôs why so many different things happen‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve seen uglies leave carcasses and stuff out as a warning, this‚Ä¶ the way they‚Äôre like, placed all together like a meat wicker basket. Seems like they were presenting it to you. Gotta remember, things don‚Äôt work like people do‚Äù. If this is the way things worked, then it could happen on the opposite: just as something could show you respect, something else could target you.

We kept moving though; carcasses went in the trash and I took a power washer to the front of the house, and after some replacing of tiles, wood, the majority of the handprints were gone. I was tired of running and I wasn‚Äôt about to let anything scare or force me off this land, well, force ‚Äúus‚Äù now I guess as this isn‚Äôt a one man circus anymore.

Likewise there‚Äôs been developments on the grander scale, more specifically the shadow war PEXU is embroiled in against our adversaries. You ever wonder who leads the Blackwood Brotherhood? It‚Äôs a question that‚Äôs been raised by many, while the New Advent has Ryan Evans we all know that man‚Äôs nothing more than a gray skinned puppet with darkness behind his wide toothy smile. After he appeared at that meeting where he addressed the world flanked by politicians from north and South America, Europe, leading figures in economics and big tech‚Ä¶ an investigation was launched by the CIA‚Äôs Special Collection Service to track when this huge shift in momentum for them happened. They sorted through tens of thousands of emails, phone calls, texts, and found almost nothing relating to the New Advent at all.

Then‚Ä¶ a singular message shared on an encrypted messaging app by some lower level informant shells connected to our adversaries sent everyone into a panic. ‚ÄúBelial‚Äù; in Hebrew it means the Devil, in the context they found it in it reignited a manhunt that had gone cold nearly 32 years ago. Believed to be the victim of a death camp in the middle east, he was being tracked by Israeli intelligence for quite some time after a special mission unit they sent to capture him all turned up dead. No wound, blemishes, nothing, just cold and unalive. After that he fell off the grid and ever since they it‚Äôs been nothing but theories connecting him to the primordial death cult we currently face: cells found in Denmark, Great Britain talked about an Augur from Damascus instructing them to revive the PARAFOR leading to shit we are still fighting to this day. Every connection from groups or training groups we get stops, no names, no ranks‚Ä¶ just the tale of a man with dark red skin, sunken eyes and a bright white smile. His lips supposedly gone from acid burns that also line his body. Yet‚Ä¶ it was all conjecture, drawings in scribbles of mad men who died when they allowed ancient shit to crawl out of their bodies like molted animals.

Until one single message: *‚ÄúBelial will lead the way‚Äù.*

Then it all hit the fan: two operatives PEXU had with us, one from the agency and the other homeland security were found dead outside of a site that doesn‚Äôt exist on any manifest in the United States internal security directorate. No documentation exists because all of it‚Äôs funding is from black budget. The recovery teams assigned to retrieve them became casualties themselves as whoever left them there carved glyphs into their eyes‚Ä¶ the same one the Blackwood uses for indoctrination. Shortly after? Deep in the Amazon ABIN, Brazil‚Äôs premiere intelligence network, was searching for a facility hidden in the rainforest connected to the cult. Attached to them were some members of the Special Activities Division‚Ä¶ almost all of them didn‚Äôt make it out alive, half of them were grievously injured. A completely compartmentalized operation was compromised and ambushed‚Ä¶ worst yet was the place they were hunting for disappeared. Every piece of metal, everything from the satellite photos was gone, like it never existed.

2 steps forward, 3 back into the woodchipper.

I won‚Äôt lie, my security office has turned into that of a makeshift war room with pelican cases and tough boxes lining the walls, a rack securing my armament, and a cork board of all I‚Äôve learned complete with red string. The noose was tightening around our neck, 2 intelligence agencies experiencing major breaches, vew few within he FBI can be trusted and even MI6 needs to work in the shadows. Everyone from megachurches to corner stores is starting to wear those golden bands, and no one seems to be noticing. Not a peep or a whisper, anyone who does goes missing‚Ä¶ 110,000\~ a year and counting, if even a tenth of that has been turned into vessels for ascension then we are neck deep in enemies. Honestly staring too deeply into it all laid out like that makes me nearly go mad sometimes, sitting back in an armory knowing that just weeks ago we fought through hell just to get ourselves an inch of breathing room.

‚ÄúOh lord, don‚Äôt tell me, you‚Äôre going insane aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Isaac‚Äôs voice managed to draw me out of it with an eye roll as he walked in and took an eye at the board: ‚ÄúHey Dwight, if you are succumbing to whatever MKUltra stuff they pumped into your veins, give me a heads up so I can get out of the blast zone alright?‚Äù. We seemed to stare at each other for a good long while as he took a step closer to he, chuckling ‚ÄúAh! I‚Äôm just messing with yah, but for real, did they‚Ä¶ put anything in your coffee? I mean you never drank coffee last time I‚Äôd seen you so I‚Äôm wondering if you‚Äôre the real Dwight‚Ä¶-‚Äù.

Isaac somehow manages to say so much and yet nothing at the same time. He leaned back against the wall next to it, crossing his arms ‚ÄúSo, what now?‚Äù. I shrugged, I leaned back and grabbed my coffee that was sitting atop a palette of ammo cans ‚ÄúWe wait until we hear more‚Äù.

‚ÄúOh come on! There‚Äôs gotta be something we can do, call up that Hogwarts fellow of your, Montana-‚Äù.

‚ÄúMontgomery‚Äù I corrected him.

‚ÄúYeah sure, we can still do something, get back out there, hop in our supe-d up mystery machine and take it to ‚Äòem!‚Äù he said emphatically, pumping his fist in the air. A supe-d up mystery that had the transmission blown to hell ever since I had to floor it over a sasquatch back in the Dakotas‚Ä¶ more on that later.

‚ÄúIsaac, we‚Äôre part of an organization‚Ä¶ well, me, but-‚Äù. ‚ÄúI am too?!‚Äù Isaac said, I pinched the bridge of my nose realizing my mistake. ‚ÄúNo, I am, you are unofficially by association‚Äù. ‚ÄúStill, how‚Äôs the pay?‚Äù. ‚ÄúTerrible‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe benefits?‚Äù. ‚ÄúWorse‚Äù. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the incentive?‚Äù he asked, raising an eyebrow.  
‚ÄúDuty‚Äù. ‚ÄúOh god you guys really are insane‚Äù.

You think? Mortals using the modern day‚Äôs best armaments to cut through the hordes of wherever-the-hell to send whatever-the-hell back to where it was summoned from by other mortals. I‚Äôve seen more of our people succumb to injuries that can‚Äôt be determined by our laws of universe than slashes and guttings, yet I still clock in. There‚Äôs definitely something wrong with me.

‚ÄúI guess that gives us some time to think‚Ä¶ or well, remember‚Äù Isaac said, rubbing his head. It was no secret his lack of memory was weighing on him, he does a good job putting up a front. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had no contact with anyone? Haven‚Äôt been back there in?‚Ä¶‚Äù I asked, his eyes snapped to me ‚ÄúToo long‚Ä¶‚Äù. We had ourselves, the cult, but then there was Theodore Cazamoth, my old boss who was obsessed with seeing how he could industrialize the primordial to advance humanity. ‚ÄúAdvancement‚Äù that 4th Special Forces Group encountered on more than one occasion and lost more than a few of their own. We had been so dug in fighting a subversive apocalypse, what the hell was Theodore able to do the last 6 years?

We were going to have to find out‚Ä¶ later. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hitting the hay, let me know if some demon tries to tear our hearts out in the middle of the night, yeah?‚Äù Isaac said heading for the door. ‚ÄúWilco, if you get the chance before me, dump my body down a flight of stairs‚Äù I joked. Isaac stopped at the door as he looked around, then back to me ‚ÄúHey Dwight‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre back‚Äù. The sincerity in his words seemed to sober me up, the same feeling that drew me back to this years ago‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why I keep marching on. Not insanity or money, duty‚Ä¶ someone had to make the shit in the dark afraid, someone had to go in there and get vengeance for the grieving spouse, the crying child, the mourning parent, or those who went alone with no one to remember their name. I did‚Ä¶ every single person I have gotten some pound of justice for.

I woke up later around witching hour to grab a water. Zeus stayed in bed as I headed downstairs with iron in my pocket just in case someone wanted to try. I rounded the bannister as I reached the bottom of my stairs, my front door just ahead of them as the entire living room was laid out with a couch, chimney, table and all‚Ä¶ I stopped as my eyes snapped to the chair in the corner. I drew my pistol and tried to hit the light, nothing‚Ä¶ my finger felt the rail underneath where it should have been. A light then shined on me causing me to squint my eyes, it aimed down as my eyes adjusted‚Ä¶ it was my taclight.

‚ÄúYou rely on your equipment too much, Dwight Nolan‚Äù the figure sitting in the chair said, that of an impoverished male‚Äôs voice. The moonlight just barely missed them as shadows cloaked them, they tossed the taclight to me causing it to bounce across the floor. With my pistol still aimed I reached down and placed it back on and got a good lock at them. In a dark suit and dress shoes was a bald man, gray skin with dozens of stitches of different sutures lined their head. A black set of shades hid their eyes as on their lap they held what looked to be a chalkboard.

*‚ÄúDwight Anthony Nolan. 39 years old. Son, Leader, Killer‚Ä¶‚Äù.*

Tally marks were underneath, hundreds of tally marks‚Ä¶ each one of them dark red, whispering to me. I knew what they meant‚Ä¶ a name, an age, a birth and death date. Some were the things I had been ordered to cut down, target packages filled in the dozens‚Ä¶ over a hundred. I looked to them, then back to the man; ‚ÄúWho the fuck are you?‚Äù.

‚ÄúA watcher, numbers keeper mostly‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou got some sort of point in doing this? I‚Äôve got half a mind to-‚Äù.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a lot of blood on your hands‚Äù the stitched up freak said accusingly. ‚ÄúWhat? Sad I put down your friends? Or something in the woods, or the swamp, or across the ocean. I‚Äôm not gonna apologize‚Äù I growled, my finger well on the trigger as I started to apply force. ‚ÄúWhat about them?‚Äù it said staring blankly at me, pointing to another tally mark‚Ä¶ Alyssa, Age 23, born in the Navajo Nation, died because we weren‚Äôt fast enough to reach her house to tell her to get to safety. It‚Äôs hand pointed to another‚Ä¶ These weren‚Äôt just kills, these were people I had failed to save. Sometimes it was because I had a wrong lead, other times I was just too slow, some there was nothing I could do‚Ä¶ but it was on my soul.

‚ÄúProtectors have continued to form a membrane of annoyance for thousands of years, Dwight Nolan. We are closer than ever to shifting the momentum back to the era where you hid in the caves protected by a campfire and a stick‚Äù It said with glee in it‚Äôs voice. It was well aware of the pressure going on around the world, it knew that I knew as well‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt give it an inch. ‚ÄúWell you won‚Äôt be there to see it‚Äù I said, pulling the trigger‚Ä¶ the gun didn‚Äôt fire. I raised an eyebrow as suddenly I could hear pounding on the door that made my heart shoot straight into my throat.

‚ÄúNo, Dwight Nolan, you won‚Äôt. You didn‚Äôt really think hiding in the rockies would save you, would it?‚Äù my light went out‚Ä¶ and I woke up in bed. That being said, I woke up to a chorus of alerts coming from the speaker on my night stand; \[‚ÄúMultiple intrusions detected‚Ä¶ multiple intrusions detected‚Ä¶. Condition Alamo, Condition Alamo, Condition, Alamo‚Äù\].

Something had followed us home.

Dossier: Condition Alamo Alamo‚Ä¶ in every military there‚Äôs a contingency when deployed for whenever the wire is breached and the enemy has entered. The Poles I worked with liked to use the term Red, a Brit unit I worked with preferred Direct Fire Charlie. I‚Äôve always stuck with one I‚Äôve encountered at a number of American Fobs: Alamo.

Zeus was barking a storm as I could hear banging coming from the front door downstairs, for reference I bought a steel lined reinforced door with heavy duty hinges and several locks. That being said I had also gotten into scraps with things that cut through material tougher than it with no issues. I had minutes at most‚Ä¶ I scrambled out of bed to find my pistol on my nightstand, drawing it and scanning around. Zeus was standing on the bed growling‚Ä¶ the banging had stopped as I looked‚Ä¶ no moonlight just like there had been hours ago.

I approached the curtains and peeked just under the edge to see, only to find an eye staring back. It was completely white, the iris gone with a pinprick needle for a pupil‚Ä¶ my blood ran cold, I remember that kind of eye. I stumbled back and aimed my boomstick but only darkness remained. Then‚Ä¶ laughter, dozens of different cackles, jeers, echoed from the outside‚Ä¶ this wasn‚Äôt right, this‚Ä¶ I had been here before, I had encountered something exactly like this‚Ä¶ back when I was just a security guard hired to protect that fuckin‚Äô forest estate.

Fuck this, we need to kit up quick. I opened the my door and shined my pistol light around, clear left and right, a few doors ahead of me were the bathroom and a study, directly to my right was the armory. I took a step out, watching the stairs down to my left‚Ä¶ only to be deafened when a gunshot rang out to my right‚Ä¶ The round barely missed me as it hit the doorway of the bathroom just in front of me, the snap and wood shavings from it showering the area as I ducked down and gripped my ear, aiming my boomstick, it was Isaac‚Ä¶ who immediately waved his hands.

‚ÄúAh hell!! Sorry!!!‚Äù. ‚ÄúIsaac what the fuck?!‚Äù I exclaimed, though I could also barely hear him as he walked over and shouted. I nursed my ear as he asked ‚ÄúHello!? You hearing me?!‚Äù.

‚ÄúNo, you deafened me!! The hell did you say?!‚Äù I asked, his answer sent a chill up my spine: ‚ÄúLook I had already seen you just before the house started to scream at us, and you nearly bit my fuckin‚Äô head off!!‚Äù. Seen me? I stood up as I scanned around ‚ÄúIsaac what the hell are you talking about?‚Äù.

‚ÄúI woke up just before the alarms started to go off, you were creeping over my bed and I was getting a bad vibe‚Ä¶ then you tried to leap on me, and I grabbed this and started to fire into you-‚Äù he said showing the Glock 19 I had given him as a bedside carry. This was odd because that was sure to have woken me up. I looked to him, my ears still pounding ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ where did‚Ä¶ I go?‚Äù I asked. A crash from downstairs caused both of us to turn and aim at the stairwell down,, Zeus had crept into the hall and began to growl at it. I reached over and pulled him by his collar ‚ÄúIsaac‚Ä¶ into the safe room, now‚Äù.

All three of us got into that armory as Isaac locked the door, I took to the desk connected to the security system as Isaac went to work preparing himself some firepower. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?!‚Äù he asked and frankly I was asking the same thing. I pulled up the grid to my property‚Ä¶ out of the several dozen motion detectors and trail cams I had set up, over 60% of them were offline, the rest were in states of damage, flickering, and only a few worked‚Ä¶ one of which was one adjacent to my driveway. A single pinprick eye looked through the tall glass, then before I could even register it‚Ä¶ a flash of silver, blackened nails on a bloated dead hand pried the camera‚Äôs steel and concrete embedded post out of the ground and smashed the unit.

That skin‚Ä¶ that hand.

I switched between the cameras, so many of them were out of commission. Some were smashed and nearly tore off their mounts, others just flashed LED colors with fragments of their vision still intact. The driveway ones were already taken out, the one on the front of the house was completely offline, something had already invaded the property and taken out our eyes‚Ä¶ not only that, but it knew where to look. I saw the notification for sound being registered, I got some crackles, static, like I expected‚Ä¶ but then, cackles‚Ä¶ deep, warped cackles of what sounded like a dozen people forced into one.

I had‚Ä¶ stopped this, I thought I did.

Then, just as I did one more run back through all of the cameras‚Ä¶ unit 21, mounted near the peak of the back of the house, highest up‚Ä¶ registered a voice. It came through calm, almost a whisper, but like some sort of predator that caught it‚Äôs prey it called out: ‚ÄúNolan‚Ä¶.‚Äù. A sudden thrash as something monstrous running across the roof shook the whole damn house, caused me to almost lose balance as I held onto the house.

‚ÄúWhat-in-the-bayou-fuck is going on?!‚Äù Isaac said, looking over my shoulder. I looked back to see he had gotten himself 2 bandoliers of shotgun shells, including a belt‚Ä¶ while in his tank top and shorts. Zeus was barking, as the sound of something crawling around the outside caught his attention. Then‚Ä¶ the movement on the roof stopped, towards the center; wet tearing and ripping, flesh and tendons, I know that sound anywhere, echoed‚Ä¶ as thuds sounded on the roof. I switched off the cameras and made for my equipment table, prepping my rifle as I pulled my belt and plate carrier on.

‚ÄúIs that shit sounding like what I think it‚Äôs sounding?‚Äù Isaac asked, aiming his shotgun around at whatever the hell was deciding to demonically touch every ceiling tile out there. He was feeling the familiar feeling too, this rhymed all too closely to whatever the hell was at the Cazamoth estate. ‚ÄúThose intelligence leaks‚Äù I pointed out, ‚ÄúYou think they found us as well?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúI think something found us‚Ä¶‚Äù; I tried to key into my radio; \[‚ÄúMain this is November-1‚Ä¶‚Äù\].

Nothing, I tried again: \[‚ÄúNovember-1 to Main, serious situation, I need support‚Ä¶.‚Äù\]. Still nothing, dead silent, I looked back to him ‚ÄúEither our comms are cut, or our friends are preoccupied‚Äù.

Front outside towards the front, a thunderous roar sounded followed by what I knew damn sure was my front door being forced off his hinges and the snap of my bannister soon after. Isaac snapped towards the door with his shotgun as I pulled down my night vision, my rifle‚Äôs laser trained on the door as well. ‚ÄúSo? What‚Äôs the plan? Sit tight and wait for help?‚Äù Isaac asked.

‚ÄúHelp ain‚Äôt coming Isaac, and by the time we even get a word out for help these things will be right ontop of us‚Äù I said, the sounds growing louder. The barrel of his shotgun dipped every slightly ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what do we do?‚Äù.

Simple: ‚Äú-We get the hell off my lawn‚Äù.

Zeus began to bark as a set of footsteps raced up the stairs and towards the door could be heard, the sound of a woman‚Äôs full lung scream growing louder. It began to slam on the door again, and again, finally it gave way and she stumbled in. In some tattered gown barely covering her dead skin soaked in what looked like tar. Her arms were bisected longways as she clawed at the floor more insect than human, through her long hair she looked to us, her face peeking through as whatever was coating her at through it‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know how she was even screaming, just a gap in her skull where her face was. She roared again; ‚ÄúAh Jesus hell!!!!‚Äù Isaac yelled as he blasted her in the chest with his shotgun. The scatter blast tore through her hip and momentarily stopped her, however she used her multiple limbs to launch right at us‚Ä¶

I responded with a group of shots, tearing through her torso, she fell onto the large wooden ready table I had in the center sending ammo cans of rounds tumbling off, and tools flying. Zeus barked snapping his jaws at her from the ground, she stood up and Isaac got one hell of a good shot at her shoulder.

She went flying back against the wall, Zeus grabbing onto her leg and beginning to kill shake it out of her socket. I joined and fired several rounds, the snap of my suppressor echoing as they impacted her brainstem. That corrosive shit splattered all along the wall as she grew still. Zeus seemed to back off, he could tell from the smell that none of that was good. A moment of still occurred and I closed the distance, I used the tip of my suppressor to move her head to the side as that shit fell onto the floor. I watched it impact the floorboards‚Ä¶ the black ichor seemed to‚Ä¶ move. My mind thought back to the plastic baggie of shit I had encountered, between the coloration, the eyes, the laughs‚Ä¶ the substance.

‚ÄúThis is from the Cazamoth Estate-‚Äù I stated my theory as I knelt down next to the corpse. ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt no way though, I read your entire memoir on that, you killed those freaks‚Äù Isaac said, scanning around with his Mossberg not wanting to even think of the theory. ‚Äú-Then tell me, Isaac, what the hell are they filled with the exact same shit from south Missouri?‚Äù I barked back. Our debate was cut short as a rumbling could be heard, inside of the walls. We could hear every single shuffle, and pained movement as it closed in on the vent‚Ä¶ it fuckin‚Äô popped off, a set of bloated dead arms, skin that cut itself on the metal edges and spewed puss, reached through as they aggressively tried to force themselves through. Two slimy heads, eyes sunken in dark rings, pin prick eyes and brown toothy smiles were attempting to force themselves through, to the point the wall around the vent opening contorted and bent. ‚ÄúIsaac!!! Nolan!!! Isaac!!! Nolan!!!‚Äù their voices sung with each other as they screamed. There was something about their aggression, their hatred I could feel through their forced smiles that was just shocking, making you feel like prey. I didn‚Äôt say a word, I fired my rifle, tearing through their skin, Isaac let loose with his shotgun.

The resulting blast of buckshot tore through the vent, showering the trio in pellets and broken metal, as the floor and wall around was torn up, all that remained was a pile of mess that was once human. I turned towards him ‚ÄúStill skeptical now?‚Äù. Isaac steadied himself the best he could, his stock in his armpit as he sheepishly dug‚Ä¶ oh for fucksakes, he dug a flask out of his shorts and tool a long sip; ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôm right here with you‚Äù.

‚ÄúFor fucksakes, Isaac‚Ä¶‚Äù I shook my head, he looked ‚ÄúWhat?! They‚Äôre invading, I‚Äôm standing our ground!!!‚Äù.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say redecorate my entire fuckin‚Äô house with double ought buck while you‚Äôre plaster out your-‚Äù our argument was cut short as the sounds of more of them from the stairwell could be heard. ‚ÄúHow about this: We clear this place of ghouls, and I‚Äôll fund the reconstruction‚Äù Isaac quipped. With what money, Isaac? you sleep on my couch‚Ä¶ or well, figuratively, or he‚Äôd be down there getting possessed and quartered by the neighborhood brigade right now. ‚ÄúWe beat them before, we can do it again, let‚Äôs go‚Äù I asserted to him, he nodded and followed.

My laser scanned as we pushed into the hallway, Isaac cleared right as I pushed forward towards the stairs, he joined me as Zeus was at our feet sniffing ahead. I was on the left side of the hall, my laser aimed down the stairs, I could see the remnants of the door hinges torn clean off‚Ä¶ they were rated for 3,500lbs of incoming force, whatever came through here did so with a vengeance.

We pushed down the stairs, my barrel leading the way and centered on the wide open front door as Isaac watched our flank. As I reached the ground floor, I shuffled right and pied around the opening, I could hear them running throughout the tall grass, laughing, whispering, eyes peeking out and then ducking back with speeds too quick for their hulking forms. all peeking through as they could see me better than my dual tubes could. Then from the tall grass, one of them bolted out. ‚ÄúIncoming!!!‚Äù I yelled, heading over to the doorway I fired as the gray mass closed the distance across my front area onto the porch. I fired rounds that cut through it‚Äôs back, lodged right in it‚Äôs body, black splashes filled the are and yet it still kept it‚Äôs momentum.

‚ÄúMove!!-‚Äù.

That‚Äôs all I could get out as Isaac ducked right, Zeus barked as the thing charged and knocked me clean off my ass through the air and into my couch. It didn‚Äôt seem to care how many rounds I fired into it, I rolled off and groggily got a good lock. Its still human torso was the cross roads for a horrifying monstrosity where dog-like legs met an army that was that of a centipede, but the chitin was made out of calcified black flesh. The other one was seemingly made of glass and had gaps between bones, the head was fighting between several different mouths, gray and sunken into it‚Äôs torso‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs sunken pin prick eyes centered on me

Whatever the hell happened to it, it decided to turn their soul into some sort of skin split thing. It‚Äôs voice was that of dozens, roars, yells, and yet it semi coherently all said: ‚ÄúNolan‚Äù.

I tried to back up as it reached down, the centipede arm gnawing at my plate carrier, tearing through the nylon cordura as I fired into it‚Äôs torso sending chunks of flesh and bone flying out the back. Zeus lept on top zinking his teeth into it‚Äôs neck causing it to yell what sounded like a cross between a tiger and a ma. Isaac planted his shotgun right on the skull, the shot caused the entire thing to explode out which completely showered me‚Ä¶ and I didn‚Äôt know what was worse: being covered in dead person or dead rotten beast.

I forced my buttstock into the ground, my head still rolling around as Isaac took point and looked to me: ‚ÄúHow you feeling? You got knocked a country mile‚Äù.

I felt the base of my neck that still felt like it was on fire: ‚ÄúBeen worse, landed right on my neck. ‚ÄúQuick, how many fingers am I holding up?‚Äù. ‚ÄúIsaac you‚Äôre not holding up any‚Äù. ‚ÄúSee? You‚Äôre good‚Äù.

From the doorway to the kitchen, a set of elongated arms connected to a body that was stretched and contorted beyond human proportions. It stepped in bow legged, its face‚Ä¶ a human skull that had been buried and pushed into the collar bone area sat below a smooth, angler fish like top portion. Two sets of jaws forced together, formed some horrifying maw that just hurt to look at,  like knives being dragged down my bare bones. We quickly fired on it, it grabbed onto the ground around it and spat at us‚Ä¶ that same tar like shit, Isaac was quicker that I was. Some of it hit directly on the plate carrier, eating into my ATAK. The smell was‚Ä¶ awful, it began to fuck with me, I didn‚Äôt know it until well into it‚Äôs effects but soon I realized I was hallucinating.

My eyes burned, my nose doing everything it could to exorcize the feeling to no avail, the pounding noise in my head felt like screams and chants. It felt real, every gust of wind, everything was hypersensitive. I scanned around, the ground unsteady, then it lunged at me. I could feel it‚Äôs claws slashing into my skin, I screamed and fired at it although it just degloved my arms like it was nothing, I could see the veins and blood underneath as it threw me into a wall and it gave in. I stood up and I was back‚Ä¶ upstairs? The thing came charging down and I managed to clip the human skull underneath, causing it to stumble. As it did I fired, the flash of my suppressor under nods short, small, yet controlled as I tore through one of it‚Äôs legs.

It then reached out and hooked my jaw‚Ä¶. Then pulled and yanked it clean off. The feeling of my tongue flapping around, my gasps for air‚Ä¶ I dropped my rifle to it‚Äôs sking as it slashed at my face. I fell to the ground, back in the living room‚Ä¶ Zeus was now gnawing at it‚Äôs head as it reached for him.

Not. My. Fuckin. Dog. I fired an entire magazine into it, having switched to auto it tore through it‚Äôs center off mass. I then charged forward and tackled it to the ground, the armored knuckles on my gloves being buried into it‚Äôs head. It‚Äôs elongated arms tried to reach and tear through my plates, I didn‚Äôt care, hell I took off my helmet and began to pound it over, and over, with the clear side of my kevlar. The burning feeling it had on my corneas combined with a chorus of screams that just wouldn‚Äôt end, I would make it end. It‚Äôs head snapped back as it began to be crushed, soon the vortex-like swirls that formed it‚Äôs eyes began to snap back‚Ä¶ looking human, and looked‚Ä¶ like me.

Isaac threw me to the ground, I gasped as I could feel the clear air again, my vision normal as the property, the house‚Ä¶ everything was silent. Zeus was sat in the center carpet‚Ä¶ surrounded by dozens of malformed, transformed adversaries that were now spending their last seconds on this earth bleeding out. I sat up, catching my breath. I looked around‚Ä¶ the beast with the elongated arms was laying on the floor, it‚Äôs head completely pulverized‚Ä¶ my helmet embedded into it. I looked to Isaac, I‚Äôll be honest I was shaken the fuck up ‚ÄúW-What the fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah you lost your shit‚Ä¶ a bunch of them began to pour in, you were firing wildly, you started tearing them apart‚Ä¶‚Äù he said, I raised an eyebrow, I didn‚Äôt remember that and I still don‚Äôt but I looked around. There was a hole in my wall wide open into my kitchen‚Ä¶ some sort of hound like beast, skeletal with blood and muscle being it‚Äôs only exterior had it‚Äôs throat ripped out and my multitool stuck in its skull. My rifle was on the ground, bolt locked to the rear amongst several others.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hear anything else‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, staggering to my feet. ‚ÄúYeah, I think we might‚Äôve gotten them all‚Ä¶‚Äù Isaac said, he paused for a moment, looking around ‚ÄúOkay, no jinxing us this time, I think they‚Äôre actually all dead‚Ä¶ or escaped‚Äù. I quickly cleared and replenished my rifle, Isaac and I secured the kitchen and basement, right around when we got primary power back on‚Ä¶ my radio crackled to life.

\[‚ÄúNovember-1, sitrep‚Ä¶‚Äù\] it was Montgomery‚Äôs voice. I looked to Isaac before hitting the push-to-talk; \[‚ÄúThis is November-1, just experienced an attack on my residence, it got kinetic‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre still alive but in a bad way‚Ä¶ how copy?‚Äù\].

A few seconds of static, some failed key-in attempts‚Ä¶ Montgomery answered \[‚ÄúRoger that‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve got an organization wide attack‚Ä¶ stay put and prepare the best you can‚Äù\]. Isaac scoffed, rolling his eyes he kicked the mangled remains of something that was formerly intruding, now decomposing ‚Äúyeah, tell manchester it‚Äôs a little late for that‚Äù.

\[‚ÄúNovember-1 to Main, I‚Äôve got several dozen EKIA, I need reinforcements-‚Äù\].

What he said next planted a deep pit in my stomach: \[‚ÄúDozens of PEXU solo units have not reported back in, November-1. We‚Äôre barely able to take accountability. Hunker down the best you can and we will be coming for you‚Ä¶ Main-Out‚Äù\]. There Isaac and I stood in my house, I sighed as he slung his shotgun, looking around ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶. Nail and boards?‚Äù.

I pinched the bridge of my nose; ‚ÄúWhat are we going to just board up all the holes and sit next to the radio?‚Äù. We did, it took around 25 minutes however Isaac and I successfully and haphazardly re-secured the house. Occasionally we would hear the sound of something outside, neither of us went to look however we did keep our weapons ready, nothing would attack again. In the morning the sound of an SUV approaching after the sun rose above the horizon cautioned all three of us to approach, my suppressor and his barrel sticking out gaps in the boards.

The blacked out vic parked in my driveway, the door opened and a young man in a navy suit, slicked back hair exited. He kept his hands up, only moving one to take his sunglasses off‚Ä¶. Montgomery chuckled at the state of things before he looked at the structure: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it, you‚Äôve had a very entertaining night, November-1?‚Äù.

I drew my barrel back from the opening and peeked through ‚ÄúYou can say that‚Ä¶ how‚Äôs everyone else doing?‚Äù. The smirk on his face faded as he sighed, approaching ‚ÄúSMUs survived intact, many weren‚Äôt touched for obvious reasons‚Ä¶ others like yourself, intelligence personnel‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs just say we‚Äôve got less comrades than when the night started‚Äù. That‚Äôs where we are at right now; Isaac and I are still holding down the fort, surprisingly we‚Äôve gotten the actual structure resecured but let‚Äôs just say it won‚Äôt be pretty for some time. I don‚Äôt plan on leaving anytime soon‚Ä¶ this place is my home, I hid here when I wanted to step away, and I don‚Äôt plan on running off again. PEXU has taken a considerable amount of casualties, though we‚Äôve sustained it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time for us to hunker down, lick our wounds, and soon we will be counter attacking.

1jyq2ah,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleepdisorders/comments/1jyq2ah/oh_f_do_i_have_a_sleep_disorder/,"Oh f***, do I have a sleep disorder?","I want to preface this with what happened a few days ago that drove me to do some research. I almost passed out at the wheel in the middle of the day. Repeatedly. I had to crank my music to eardrum pain levels and slap myself for 30 miles to stay conscious. I have been experiencing \*extreme\* exhaustion during the day. Like I physically cannot stay awake, it feels like an external body is forcing my eyes closed. If I am sitting down, I will pass out and start lucid dreaming almost immediately. I am getting plenty of uninterrupted sleep at night. This is not the first bout of this, but it is the most extreme.

I have always had the need to nap multiple times a day, even as a kid. I have always had lucid dreams that begin immediately into a nap. Even napping for 10 minutes (against my will I might add), I will basically hallucinate. I am in my room, or bed, doing normal things, and the entire dream feels like hours, and I am only asleep for a short while. 

I have been sober for almost a decade, but the way this sleep overtakes me feels like heroin nod. Almost every morning, about 30 minutes into being awake, reading the news, fully sitting up with coffee; I pass out, head nodded onto my chest. It is sudden. Sometimes I will wake up within 5 minutes, sometimes I sleep like that for an hour. I have no control over it. Or working at my laptop, I will be forced to stop because I just can't keep my eyes open and I have to nap.

I started experiencing bouts of extreme insomnia when I was 8. It was really bad for a number of years. When I was 17 I started sleeping 12-14 hours a night, sleeping through literal hours of alarms. That went on for about 5 years. I experienced sleep paralysis quite a bit as a teenager and in my early twenties. Those ""dreams"" were always really violent and terrifying.

It's always been relatively manageable. I worked in night life, or from home. I used drugs to stay awake, or put me to sleep. Now I take supplements instead. I accepted a long time ago that I need more sleep at weird intervals than the average person. But the need to sleep during the day is becoming debilitating. It's like a switch was flipped a few months ago and I cannot get on top of this. I never feel rested. I thought it was just fatigue, but the constant lucid dreaming feels like it's something else.

I am very wary of self-diagnosing, so even though I have read hours of articles I will definitely be seeking medical advice. Possibly a sleep study. But that will take time as I do not have insurance and I'm not financially solvent enough to afford this out of the blue. I just want to ask this community, do any of these experiences resonate with you? I feel like I'm losing my grip. ",1,1744603346.0,sleepdisorders,1,1.0,False

1jyq0ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ForestHasEyes/comments/1jyq0ul/seal_team_4_went_dark_in_the_south_pacific_part_1/,Seal Team 4 went dark in the South Pacific [Part 1],"We know nothing of our larger world.

That is the only opening statement I can give on this. Per United States Naval Regulations 1990 - Article 1129, all missions are required to give the necessary amount of after action reports per the discretion of the command. I have been tasked due to my‚Ä¶ close encounter of the maritime kind, but I‚Äôll get to that, originally I would just keep this stock until certain advisor elements have told me to retell this the best I can for archiving purposes. If you‚Äôre seeing this you are either a senior DOD intelligence officer, or it‚Äôs been declassified and posted to open source. 

‚Ä¶We might have bigger problems if it‚Äôs the latter. 

Some background to give context for this‚Ä¶ full disclosure I‚Äôm Petty Officer Second Class Spears, a Special Warfare Operator for the United States Navy for the last 9 years, popularly known as a ‚ÄúNavy Seal‚Äù. I‚Äôve been assigned to Team 4 for the last year and some change, Alpha Platoon, we fall under Navy Special Warfare Command‚Äôs Group 2 based out of good old Virginia proper. Our main AO is South America, I‚Äôve done time in with the Africa group, Indochina, but let‚Äôs just say South America is the ‚Äúfun time‚Äù region to be for many reasons, especially if you‚Äôre in your prime. Alright, enough fucking about before my O3 rides my ass‚Ä¶ 

He‚Äôs our Platoon Commander, Captain Daughtery, he‚Äôs from DEVGRU, a younger guy but he‚Äôs absolutely straight to the point: get in, get our tasks done, go home, get on the bird, get after it. He‚Äôs rotated off the line to get some time as a JOIC (Junior Officer In Charge) on another team, and you can tell he‚Äôs dying to get back. Working with him is our platoon chief, Chief Murphy‚Ä¶ going into an organization with a famous last name, especially one that was KIA, is an easy way for you to get hazed. You can tell he‚Äôs been dragged through the mud, despite this the old bronx salt dog that he is has survived‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs from DEVGRU too, Red Squadron but only because I caught sight of the old native head patch in his garage during a barbeque, he also carries the hatchet around too and I ain‚Äôt gonna be the one to ask if it‚Äôs for show. Alright, there‚Äôs the pertinent people in charge‚Ä¶ 

Back to our AO, as much as shore leave with partying is fun, Team 4‚Äôs AO isn‚Äôt as slow as you might think or we might want it to be. A large part of our mission set down there is ‚Äúcounter insurgency‚Äù, which ends up directly assisting partner nations in dealing with narco activity. Many times this means we go low profile, stack up with critical response teams, and almost always have to pull the heavier end of the weight by the end of the night. Sometimes however we get dispatched to conduct maritime ops with an SDV (Seal Delivery Team) or SWCC themselves, not that often but it‚Äôs not uncommon, most times it‚Äôs boats, once in a while it‚Äôs a sub, all of it to combat the trafficking of both drug product and human cattle that runs directly into the rest of the Americas. In terms of forever wars, it‚Äôs at least a mildly noble cause to fight for‚Ä¶ 

One thing you quickly learn about Team 4 versus 5, 7, and 10 is your intel is usually short notice, you‚Äôre not allowed to learn much else beyond hard borders set by your intelligence pax, and the situation can evolve completely down to the last ounce by the time you get there. Basically: you never know what the hell is going on until you‚Äôre boots down and sending it, nothing embodies that more than this mission. 
It was just past new years when we were spun up at the crack of dawn for a VBSS (Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure) of a vessel that had lost communication with the mainland several nautical miles off the coast of Peru towards Chile. We got to our ad hoc TOC for a briefing, coffee and caffeine rampant as we tried to remain wide awake for what came next. A man only identifying himself as someone from the ‚ÄúState Department‚Äù greeted us inside of that plywood, box fan shack, standing next to a Peruvian intelligence officer. The dude was bald, sporting a five o‚Äôclock shadow, and dressed like an accountant‚Ä¶ the stress lines told me he spent more time in country than home, that was enough to tell us to pay attention. The Peruvian would talk in his native language as the dude immediately translated to us what was happening, along with his own input. 

The vessel was a dutch cargo freighter, ‚ÄúAmity‚Äù, approximately 400 meters long, a control tower towards the rear, marked out of Thailand that was set to transport foods and perishable goods to the Peruvian capital of Lima. At 2214 hours several days ago, it missed its window to begin its route in and continued southwards, going deep towards the Chile coast. When attempting to hail it, messages responded with only static, Peruvian Navy contemplated sending a vessel to conduct a welfare check however a harsh winter storm made waters unsafe. Surprisingly the vessel was still topside, and when a message got through‚Ä¶ 

They played a recording of it as we all read a print out of the transmission. Amity responded signaling immediate distress, saying ‚Äúwe have been boarded, we have been boarded‚Äù. Control personnel began to try and zero in on Amity‚Äôs position as they gauged for more information, when asked about the size of the attacking vessel‚Ä¶ Amity simply responded: ‚Äúno opposing boat‚Äù and then followed up saying; ‚Äúthey have overrun the deck‚Äù. The background sounds nearly drowned out the voice, automatic gunfire could be heard.

This‚Ä¶ caused a fair amount of confusion, my Platoon Commander especially double took and eyed around‚Ä¶. In what was less than 6 minutes, a massive freighter had not only been boarded, but had their entire top deck seized. The final message seemed to cap off the sour feeling of anxiety that was lurking, as in an all too monotone voice the man simply said: ‚ÄúThey can see me, I‚Äôve been found‚Äù. Afterwards‚Ä¶ the transponder turned off making locating it difficult. 

This is when things got weirder‚Ä¶ Amity was found nearly 40 degrees off their trajectory, several hundred nautical miles where they were before the storm. No other vessels could be located, even so much as a set of rogue rafts used by pirates. Pirate activity in the area as well is almost nothing, cartels didn‚Äôt want to mess with international shipping lanes lest they bring down the hammer of INTERPOL on themselves and things get messy. It physically made no sense that anyone could reach a vessel of that size, in rough waves, with no craft, no raft, and board, with no clear motive. 

Locals were dragging feet for days without sending any response, citing ‚Äúrough conditions‚Äù as an excuse to let the freighter collect dust. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ sadly more common than you‚Äôd think, likewise they pressured the US after the contracting agency responsible for the cargo was marked to be an American pharmaceutical company attempting to have them cut down through dragon's pass versus the Panama Canal. Chief immediately picked out something: ‚Äú-If they were tasked to stop at Lima, why go through Dragon‚Äôs pass?‚Äù. The Jaded fed simple took a long drag that killed half his cig, shrugging ‚Äúgood question‚Ä¶‚Äù. 

Captain Daughtery looked unimpressed; ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre telling me their mess to avoid tariffs has us cleaning up their fiasco?‚Äù. The state rep shook his head ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre cleaning their fiasco. In approximately 2 hours you‚Äôre to board, seize, and secure the vessel and find out what‚Äôs become of the crew‚Äù. 

Would you believe this is one of the more positive interactions we‚Äôve had with feds in South America? 

The entire thing was just eerie, when we met up in the team room it was the captain, chief, myself and a few other senior guys. Daughtery exuded westpoint confidence and clarity, when he shut the wooden door and the water bottle use to counter weight slid down, leaving us in silence, I could see the dread behind his eyes. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ cartel? There was gunfire in the background‚Äù one of the other team leaders asked, Chief just shook his head in response. Daughtery however controlled the room ‚ÄúWhatever it is, we‚Äôll go deal with it, treat it as if anything else that could get intensely kinetic‚Ä¶ an air infil isn‚Äôt probable but we will have some bird coverage, Spears, you guys will be going up the side by ladder so make sure everyone‚Äôs got their MAS suit. The waves are reported to be very rough, so make sure we go out on an empty stomach. Keep your heads on and whatever this is will be over by supper‚Äù. 

If only it was that simple.

‚ÄúMAS‚Äù stands for Maritime Assault Suits, a grey waterproof suit specifically designed for Navy Special Warfare operators to use during boardings, dives, and other tactical inserts in and through the water. The grey used has also become fairly popular in the seal community, ‚ÄúMAS Grey‚Äù is a common gear theme and our platoon adopted it specifically for maritime operations. Within 15 minutes we had checked each other's assault suits, tightened down the slop, gotten our radios filled, roads loaded. It‚Äôs my personal opinion that human bodies have internal alarms to warn us when we‚Äôre walking into certain doom, back in ancient times we would look into a cave and see a face that just wasn‚Äôt right before getting out of there, a canyon that smelt of death. Now? I struggled to breathe even as the neck ring of my assault suit was fitted on and we were heading to the chalk. 

Normally an SDV team would meet with us as SWCC usually prioritized DEVGRU, however they were on sight ready to link up with us. We helped load their zodiacs into the CH-47s, heavy duty rafts with mounted weapons, the best you could get for light boarding and even then they were a pain to be in. Daughtery was going to be on my raft while Chief rode with the other, even if dawn was a few hours away the darkness mandated we wore our nods. 

Several radio checks came through, Chief chimed in‚Ä¶ then the SWCC crew chief; [‚Äúcraft is ready, Alpha-6 check‚Äù]. The commander followed: [‚ÄúThis is Alpha-6, platoon is ready, all pax green‚Äù]. 

A night VBSS onto a lost freighter, in which an unknown force had somehow overtaken the vessel‚Ä¶ moreover, the distress signalers final words stuck with me even as the engines drowned out all noise past my helmet‚Äôs headset: ‚ÄúThey have found me‚Äù. To be so calm in the face of defeat means resignation‚Ä¶ or something else. None of them are good answers, but we had to go figure out why it all happened. 

We immediately knew why an air landing was off the table when we got out there, the 47‚Äôs rotors battled the harsh winds so much the whole damn airbus was rocking back and forth. Even the commander gripped the overhead handle, glancing around under nods to ensure he had all his men. Soon we opted to get into the Zodiac‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a common thing in the open ocean, if the winds are rough the waves are twice as bad. I braced myself as the front SWCC gunner ensured his leash was fastened, checking his rotary M134 as everyone grabbed onto something even if it was each other. The crew chief signaled to the driver three fingers‚Ä¶. Then two‚Ä¶.. Then one. 

In seconds the Zodiac slid out, hitting the rough waves as we all bobbed, I don‚Äôt know how they did it, but even if the first wave of water made me think we all went under‚Ä¶ we didn't. It was cold, the sky was dark as the lights of the chinook disappeared leaving us to finish the job. In front of us was a dark horizon with a distant sunrise still hours away, the white phosphor of our night vision trying its best to give us some semblance but the crashing waves kept us moving and blind. You know it‚Äôs easier to go to space then it is the dead sea? I know why‚Ä¶ I hate the ocean, ironic cause I‚Äôm a seal, but being out there with that primordial body of water salivating at the chance to engulf us‚Ä¶ thousands of ships have gone missing over the past centuries, easy to understand why. 

Our second craft was to our nine o‚Äôclock as we pursued, the IR strobes on our helmets allowing us to see where we were. The distant rotar of our air cover was behind us, from what I could tell and heard after, they were doing everything they could to keep up. I could see the front gunner of the Zodiac scan around, then stop at something in front, he followed up on the radio; [‚ÄúPrimary objective, One O‚Äôclock‚Ä¶ adjust to 312 degrees‚Äù].

I peaked up, through the horizon of man high waves‚Ä¶ I could see it: The massive form of the cargo freighter looming in the distance, no lights showing that either power was out or they had gone dark. Neither was a good option‚Ä¶ As we grew closer, the larger it got, the rougher the waves were all I could think was‚Ä¶ what the hell could brave these conditions and lay claim to that vessel, that quickly. 

We passed the stern of the boat, SWCC opted to center around the port side as it was the closest. Despite the height of the boat, it was nothing we hadn‚Äôt done before. Two of our guys prepped the ladder prong‚Ä¶ You want to know why VBSS sucks? The ladder, you know those small, single person ladders you see at cheap carnivals, the prong has one of those attached, once it hooks it secure onto the edge of the vessel we then proceed to climb it‚Ä¶ in 90lbs of gear, in the dark, with rough waves, under night vision, often times assailants would commence an attack seeing as we were vulnerable and we would rely on support craft and air cover. For all our training and equipment, it was a dangerous job, one that made my stomach sink as the cold air and water doused us. 

The dark vessel loomed over us, nothing but shadows where there should be some sort of warning light‚Ä¶ knowing this had been left captured for days only made the feeling grow stronger. The gunner scanned around, a few of us noticed the rear of the ship‚Ä¶ the lack of broken waves, one of our guys called in; [‚ÄúPropeller is down, ship is adrift‚Äù]. 

We got to the port side, the SWCC crew keeping us steady so as not to get us all pulled under, an absolute death sentence when beside a monolithic hulk of metal. The tension rose, I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know why but I felt like everything was watching me as we all kept our barrels trained, on every shadow, every ledge, not from the ship but from the waves. I opted to go first as they secured the ladder, my captain gave me a pat on the shoulder as I climbed. One of our guys and a SWCC member kept the ladder steady, even then the thing shook like hell as I slowly climbed, praying it wouldn‚Äôt give away. All the while‚Ä¶ I could feel a burning sensation of something zeroing in on me, through my headset I could hear Chief call in; [‚ÄúBird says no pax visible on deck‚Äù]. 

If it was a raid several days ago, they‚Äôre long gone‚Ä¶ if they‚Äôre still here, they‚Äôre likely to be held up inside to avoid superior firepower. I drew my pistol as I got to the top, my glove death gripping the metal ledge as I pulled myself up, quickly transitioning to my 416 as fast as I could. I got that laser up, safe under my nods hoping it would give me some sort of advantage. You think that‚Äôs what old school sailors said, harpoon in hand before meeting the kraken? I quickly dragged the second guy up and we stood back to back, 180 degrees of security on both sides as the waves bobbed‚Ä¶ Something wasn‚Äôt right. Even if it had been several days under harsh winds, to arrive on a ship that is dead empty and silent meant death‚Ä¶ or worse. 

Soon a bunch of us stacked up against one of those containers, Daughtery and another took one group as I took another; [‚ÄúSecure top deck‚Äù] came through the headset, crackling from the moisture. It‚Äôs all we needed though, I quickly learned my condition wasn‚Äôt the only case as those next to me were all too ready to get going. We pied each corner, some pushed long down the side of the ship as I continued to cut through the middle rows of containers as we looked. Any of the shadows could contain an enemy, an AK prepped, safety off, waiting to dump a magazine into any of us, that thought kept adrenaline high. Despite this: no bodies, no life, nothing‚Ä¶ Soon as I cut to the starboard side, slight movement to my right caused me to raise my barrel, my peq laser met another. 

[‚ÄúBlue Starboard‚Äù] is what we quickly called in, Chief‚Äôs zodiac linked up with ours. Murphy himself was the one to link up with me as our combined force pushed towards the front of the ship. He used the headset since attempting to hear with the crashing waves was nearly impossible [‚ÄúAny OPFOR or crew?‚Äù]. 

[‚ÄúNegative‚Äù]. 


Then one of the team leads on my craft called in [‚Äúreached the front of the vessel, located forward antenna, completely inoperable‚Äù]. Chief and I made our way there as the middle portions of containers were slowly, deliberately cleared, all of us slipping, attempting to keep our balance on the dark vessel. At the base of the front antenna tower between two stacks of containers that creaked and groaned with the shifting of the dead ship, the console was‚Ä¶ completely gone. For reference it would‚Äôve been the redundant backup to assist long range communications incase there was a malfunction, the system itself weighed nearly 500lbs and should‚Äôve been bolted down‚Ä¶ ‚Äúshould‚Äôve‚Äù. It was gone‚Ä¶ broken metal under the bolts meant it wasn‚Äôt unfastened‚Ä¶ it was pulled off. 

I looked to Chief who just stared at the spot, his hand moving to his PTT: [‚Äú7 to 6‚Äù]. 

Daughtery responded [‚ÄúGo for 6‚Äù].

[‚ÄúForward communication system has been pulled off, no sign of it‚Äù]. 

There was a pause as the Platoon Commander came through in response: [‚ÄúSay again last‚Ä¶ you said ‚Äòpulled off‚Äô?‚Äù]. The bafflement in his voice mirrored our own; [‚ÄúCorrect‚Ä¶ bolts still on deck‚Ä¶‚Äù]. Chief then leaned down, on a particularly large piece that had a jagged edge, I could see some sort of substance. I kneeled down with him, it was strangely congealed, like blood but‚Ä¶ not, we‚Äôll get to that later. Strangely the water splashing all around it didn‚Äôt seem to move it one single bit, like it repelled it. 

Daughter answered back at this point: [‚ÄúCopy‚Ä¶ 7 leave a small unit to maintain presence on deck with bird support, bring the rest of the unit to me, we‚Äôve found an entry point, how copy?‚Äù]. 

Chief shot up, flicking it off his mechanix glove [‚ÄúRoger, enroute‚Äù]. 

Four were left to keep a watch on the deck as the rest of us hustled, as best as we could over a slick deck, towards the main tower at the stern of the ship. We had captured the deck, ready to move in and yet I wasn‚Äôt locked in at all‚Ä¶ I seemed to space out, my attention drawn to the waves. That‚Äôs where I kept feeling sized up from, since I grabbed that ladder‚Ä¶ and underneath the crashing sound I could hear talking. It was indecipherable, if you put a gun to my head right now and told me what was said, I‚Äôd tell you to pull the trigger cause I do not know. It was‚Ä¶ welcoming however, that‚Äôs the worst part, like it wanted to pull my gaze and I don‚Äôt know why. I shook my head and focused on anything else, the cold, the moisture, the exhaustion and heat inside of the MAS suit‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what knocked it off. 

We got to the entry point where the commander had his force stacked up, approaching the hinge side we could see it: a large bulkhead door that was swinging freely, unable to relatch or become secure as it had been mangled. So‚Ä¶ coming from an experienced breacher, they‚Äôll leave marks, obviously. Pry bars and sledges will make obvious impacts, welds and thermite will of course melt the metal‚Ä¶ the doorlock wheel, the edge of this 3 inch thick door was bent. Not from an invasive tool but from sheer force, the paint wasn‚Äôt even chipped, not a single bit. The solid metal of the wheel as well had been bent like it was taffy, like you left plastic in the sun for too long and it melted and bent under it‚Äôs own weight. Standing there in the rain assessing this‚Ä¶ it was uncanny. 

That‚Äôs how a lot of this felt: unnatural, variables that shouldn‚Äôt exist, dread that came from a situation where we knew none of us had ever been. That‚Äôs the human instinct I mentioned earlier, in territory you don‚Äôt understand, with something you‚Äôre not made to fight. Yet‚Ä¶ here we were. Chief signaled a breach, and we pushed in, a team went in first and it was now or never. 

We pushed in, two barrels leading as one of our guys had to pretty much shoulder check the door open to prevent the 200lb hunk of metal from taking out any of our shins, due to the damage it was free swinging. With the ghostly absence outside, you could be forgiven for forgetting about the remnants of the overtake, the gunfire in the radio transmission- I did. Once we poured in it all came rushing back. Metal furniture was destroyed, far more than any rocking of a ship could do, counters were cracked as signs of a struggle were clear as we secured what was a large common room area. No signs of gunfire, no brass or impact holes, yet blood smeared the floor‚Ä¶ red, and it led out into the hall. I stacked up with one of my platoon members, I squeezed his shoulder, adrenaline skyrocketed as we pushed into the hall‚Ä¶ 

It‚Äôs one of the most definite ways to die in close quarters combat and yet‚Ä¶. Nothing. 

Doors, some open, others closed greeted us as we controlled and I stuck to the right side. Our lasers centered on someone, a body‚Ä¶ slumped at the end of the hall with something protruding from their stomach‚Ä¶ under nods I couldn‚Äôt get a good look from our end. Our guys quickly followed us in as we split up, searching the different rooms shouting; ‚ÄúAmericans entering!!‚Äù, ‚ÄúMake yourself known!!‚Äù. The purpose of a VBSS isn‚Äôt extermination, it‚Äôs boarding and rescuing, even when fighting combatants we‚Äôre told to unironically ‚Äúshoot to wound‚Äù so we can capture them for intel. 

Nothing. Nothing but that body looking at me as our guys poured down each room as I and the man on my left kept security forward as we slowly inched with every advance our guys made to the left and right. Soon‚Ä¶ we reached it: It was a smaller man, slumped forward with his whole throat just‚Ä¶. Let me put it this way, I could see his spinal cord from where I was standing. His eyes were punctured, still there as I could see the chunks of what was left but something had stabbed deep into them. The ‚Äúobject‚Äù I said earlier made itself known, some sort of spear-like implement that at a first glance looked like petrified wood, or something to that nature, as white and enigmatic as marble but much more coarse. I motioned for him to cover me, he kept his 416 trained on the man as I searched him‚Ä¶ a grey polo with ‚ÄúZephyr Evo‚Äù on the right side chest was embroidered, and the thing had gone clean through his sternum and was inside the wall behind him. 

As our guys searched this area, I heard over comms; [‚ÄúGot 2 KIA in here‚Äù]. 

[‚Äú3 bodies in here‚Äù]. 

Some of them crew, others the ‚ÄúZephyr‚Äù personnel, all seemingly killed and left to rot‚Ä¶ boy did it fuckin‚Äô smell. It didn‚Äôt hit until after the adrenaline wore off a bit but it wreaked, combined with the moisture and some of the bodies had bloated. 

We pushed upstairs, clearing out latrines and other rooms, and found some more dead in similar condition, but no signs of fighting. We reached the bridge around 0250, forcing open the door we quickly got our points of domination and focused barrels on the center. Not much was destroyed, except for the wheel of the ship which had been half torn off the mount, and the communications console was completely caved in‚Ä¶ a substance coating it, similar to the one found on the front comms. Chief noticed and as we were inside, we took a white light to it: dark blue, almost looking like paint with a reflective inside, it was gelatin to the point of high density. Droplets led from an angled part of the broken comms unit out of the room. 

One of our guys asked ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶ some sort of coolant?‚Äù. 

Chief wiped it off on the edge of a counter ‚ÄúNothing that I had seen‚Äù. 

Suddenly from below [‚ÄúA-2 to A-7, I‚Äôve got confirmed movement below‚Äù]. The speed in which we took off down those stairs would rival usain bolt, many of us breaking safety and skipping steps as we stacked up alongside our second squad. Chief quickly moved in behind; ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you see?‚Äù. 

‚ÄúA-2‚Äù, the E-5 leading second squad kept watch down the stairwell with his men as he whispered: ‚ÄúSomething moved out‚Ä¶ think it was one of the attackers as they didn‚Äôt respond to our call outs. It took one look at us and I could see their eyes shine before they rushed to the left side of the hall through the middle door‚Äù. Chief around the corner to where our lasers scanned, Captain Daughtery clarified: ‚Äúreflected‚Ä¶ IR?‚Äù. 

A-2 shook his head ‚ÄúNo, didn‚Äôt give off an IR shine‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think I need to state this‚Ä¶ but people‚Äôs eyes don‚Äôt shine, and if it didn‚Äôt give off an IR reflection‚Ä¶ the PL got on comms: [‚ÄúOpfor possibly located, signs of peq and nod usage. Proceed with caution‚Äù]. From here on out‚Ä¶ we limited our lasers and tightened up discipline‚Ä¶ we carefully moved down in a split stacked straight into the hallway, approaching the first set of opposing doors as four men poured into each side. As we moved forward and they called ‚Äúroom clear!!‚Äù... we heard it. 

The silence was broken, causing a visible jump in all of us: a shrill growl, like that of a hiss but with major reverb behind it, came from our front left‚Ä¶ a huge amount of thrashing came as we could hear it flipping furniture and cabinets before moving back further towards the stern. I say cabinets specifically‚Ä¶ because one tipped and came flying out into the hall and laid across it.

[‚ÄúOPFOR located, 10 O‚Äôclock, maneuver!!‚Äù] Chief ordered as I and a few others moved into that left room. What greeted us was a commons and sleeping quarters than had a torn up couch gutted, yet‚Ä¶ no figure. As we scanned the same substance from before could be seen drenching the floor before heading to the back. We moved towards the door and continued to see it and the hallway connected to a large back storage area. We scanned the room with our lasers, lassoing with others from the main hallway and what I believe was the rooms on the right before signaling a joint entry. 

All of us pushed in, quickly clearing under desks and in between shelves, a labyrinth between us and whoever else was in here. So many of us had to switch to pistols for better aim, I had to. My sidearm was a P226 MK25, a reliable weapon, luckily the surefire attachment had an IR flood along with its normal flashlight. I took the lead as I squeezed between shelves‚Ä¶ following the trail like bread crumbs as I could hear our guys on the other side move as well. 

[‚ÄúSee anything?‚Äù]. 

[‚ÄúNegative, continuing search‚Äù]. 

[‚ÄúStay sharp, there‚Äôs so much fuckin‚Äô dead space‚Äù]. 

I managed to squeeze my 200lb ass through enough to search‚Ä¶ The trail ended through a pile of collapsed chairs‚Ä¶ as I followed it and scanned towards my front‚Ä¶ 


A set of black, deep sea eyes greeted me, a smooth form with a bump where I would‚Äôve gauged its nose was, a mandible that hung open with hundreds of razor thin teeth, and hideous gill flaps underneath it. It lurked between an opening, sizing me up as it stood a head taller than me, lumpy skin with periodic spikes, frills that made my skin crawl, and webbing between it‚Äôs all too long fingers and feet. The thing paused, a large wound where it‚Äôs shoulder was as the substance leaked out of it like molasses. I stood there, my throat clenched in fear as my barrel shook slightly‚Ä¶ 

I was staring into the eyes of something that was more ancient than the trident I endured so much hell for and to serve with. It could tell, as its flaps and gills seemed to twitch‚Ä¶ it roared, the shrill yell from before was much louder‚Ä¶ at the center what sounded like a man yet‚Ä¶ drowned out by a high pitched whine that made my ears ring. I cringed as it lept, my barrel aiming as it was all too quick, its jaw seemingly opening even wider as it slashed and its arm dragged a whole cabinet with it. Its razor thin claws got stuck in the nylon of my plate carrier, my finger pulled the trigger and began to fire off shots. Rounds impacted the chest and I could see a splash and yet it kept staring. It thrashed, lunging forward as its claws made contact with my skin, I cringed as it pulled a whole damn cabinet down with it and onto me. 

Meanwhile, my headset was going off the chain; [‚Äúwhat was that?!‚Äù]. 

[‚ÄúWho‚Äôs letting rounds loose?!‚Äù]. 

As my backplate hit the ground, I stomped down and took out one of its legs, much thinner than my own, as my off hand grabbed it‚Äôs shoulder and pushed it off. I felt its claws slide out of me‚Ä¶ a feeling that chills me now while I‚Äôm writing this report. The thing bit down and gnawed on my nightvision and I got an all too visceral look at it‚Äôs throat: thorny spikes that looked like the esophagus of a leviathan lined a scaly interior, behind those hundreds of teeth were rows of dozens more, all chewing on my 50 grand quads that were protecting my head more than my helmet was. 

That‚Äôs when I could only describe as an IR flood from the others bathe the creature, a setting on the peq laser that acts like a flashlight for night vision. With me and the thing intrinsically coiled together, I tried to kick it away, only for it to use me as a launch pad. It slashed my right arm, adding to the puncture in my left shoulder, and one of it‚Äôs spiked feet tore through my pants opening up a gash on my thigh. I rolled to my side, messily pulling my sidearm to see it close the distance with my boys, with all of us so close together they couldn‚Äôt just let loose or they‚Äôd risk catastrophic fratricide. Somehow even with what I then knew was it‚Äôs blood gushing all over, it took several rifle rounds, one of it‚Äôs hand slashing across the front of Daughtery‚Äôs plate carrier, his front plate saving him even as he slipped back from the force into several others. Despite this the captain roared as he cracked off several rounds, visibly tearing into the thing‚Äôs ribs.

I pushed myself up, my body screaming in pain as I fumbled to slam my glock back into it‚Äôs holster. I shakily held my rifle, adrenaline being the only thing allowing me to move operationally as we pursued. 

Chief lit up comms with [‚ÄúOpfor sighted!!! One making a run for the deck!!! Cut off entry point!!‚Äù]. 

The distant sound of the open door above being closed, leaving us in contained silence as we all slowly pied the corners. Chief and I, and several others carefully maneuvered through, my nods scratched to all hell but I kept going. ‚ÄúYou good, Spears?‚Äù Chief asked, truthfully? I felt like I just hugged a woodchipper, but I wasn‚Äôt going to tell him that. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good‚Äù. 

Soon we heard it‚Ä¶ calling out, the same way an animal does to its pack when it‚Äôs cornered‚Ä¶ elongated, desperate cries from deep within the bowls. We moved forward towards the front, ducking below pipes and equipment, our lasers scanning every cover point until we got to one of the lowest points, we opened a bulkhead and a foot of water came sloshing out. Chief quickly warned; [‚ÄúThis is 7, we‚Äôve got a possible integrity breach near middle hoppers-‚Äù]. 

Was it trying to make an escape? Did it escape? 

We pushed through, our movement no longer secret from the breaking of water, still‚Ä¶ as we turned a corner, against a metal wall we could see it‚Ä¶ it had one of the fucking 2 inch thick metal floor plates peeled back at the corner like a damn can. It was trying to escape, trying to very literally crawl into the hopper. As it turned to look, it truly looked like something that crawled out of the deep‚Ä¶. Even if the water was just a foot deep, it seemed to move faster when it withdrew and faced us, the sludge it was bleeding floated atop the water. 

I made a low growl, knowing it was cornered‚Ä¶ and then moved towards us, sliding unnaturally fast through the water as I could see its claws. We opened up, fuck shoot to wound, we were shooting to survive. All of us backed up, my back hit the wall as I could feel my wounds sting, as myself, Chief, and several others quickly shot into that thing. Holes opened up, more of its blood leaked out, I could see its jaws open up and it growed‚Ä¶ a round shattered its jaw, another through its face. Then‚Ä¶. It grew still. The ship rocked as we all stood there, taking in the situation as Chief quickly took control: [‚Äú7 to 6, Opfor is down, securing hoppers‚Äù]. 

From there, seizing of all materials and evidence was had, along with consolidation of any and all casualties to be collected by higher authorities. Surprisingly‚Ä¶ there weren‚Äôt many others, Daughtery‚Äôs carrier protected him, I got the worst of it‚Ä¶ second to one of our guys on deck. It was during the fiasco, down to the second I had seen it‚Ä¶ According to his second on his side of the ship, he stopped and just stared out at the waves. The only thing he said was: ‚ÄúYou hear it?‚Äù. 

Transcript provided read‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHear what?‚Äù A-3A asks A-3S as he seems to stop, flicking up his nods as he stared into the darkness and took a step forward. A-3A, now thoroughly freaked out, visibly cocked his head and asked; ‚ÄúHey, you alright? The fuck you hear?‚Äù. A-3S then‚Ä¶ according to the ISR footage from the bird, tore off his IR stobe on his helmet, and walked off the side of the deck into the ocean. A-3S immediately yelled into comms: [‚ÄúOverboard!!! A-3S is Overboard!!!!‚Äù]. 

56 hours of search and recovery provided no information as to what happened to him, only evidence of him was one of his boots‚Ä¶ found over 1,000 nautical miles at a port in Tirua, Chile, a distance impossible for any simple drift within that time frame. How did they know it was his? One of his teeth was found inside, dental records matched. Officially he was lost during the VBSS initial boarding, in reality‚Ä¶ something coerced him in. 

We were all kinds of torn up, unsure as to what had gone on however we finally got an extended AAR 3 days later. In the interim I had been given a serious amount of stitches, enough military grade fentanyl to make me forget I was cut open like a deli, and we were all brought to a much more classy FOB in the central pacific. The state department rep from before greeted us, this time in jeans, a polo, slicked back hair‚Ä¶ he walked in and set down a stack of folders, telling us; ‚ÄúTake one pass it left‚Ä¶ Gentlemen I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre all aware of what you saw on the Amity?‚Äù. 

Chief chuckled, quipping back ‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôre supposed to say nothing? Maybe a pirate? That‚Äôs what killed one of our guys and slashed up another?‚Äù. He patted my good soldier, the state rep instead lit a cigarette; ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. 

This caught Chief off guard, I could tell because of the silence and single eyebrow raise, very rarely is he ever there. He flipped open one of the folders; ‚ÄúPage 5‚Äù, we did‚Ä¶ it was an autopsy report. I could see it in it‚Äôs full detail, a dark blue color, the layers of flesh and some skeleton that looked like a cross between a neanderthal and a frog. ‚ÄúWhat you encountered aboard the Amity is known within the community as Populus Aqua, current origins are theories based off cryptozoology with none yet being proven as concrete. Many different subspecies exist, one of which being qui tenebrosa aqua: ‚ÄòPeople of the Dark Water‚Äô... that‚Äôs what you found aboard that dutch ship‚Äù. 

The absolute certainty of what he was saying, even as we were seeing what looked like images from some shitty sci-fi movie was‚Ä¶ surreal. I knew it was real, hell it made me bleed, took another one of our guys, it had to be real. 

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶..‚Äù one of our gunners who was sitting near the back, awkwardly eyeing the picture of the cut open sea demon, back to the man: ‚Äú... Mermaids?‚Äù. 

‚ÄúIn the popular modern sense? No, in fact it‚Äôs debated if they‚Äôre even related to humans besides their pipedal usage of hips and similar limbs. These things predate written history and are seen on ancient carvings everywhere from Jerusalem to New Zealand‚Äù he said, he flipped a few pages; ‚Äúcheck page 11 if you want more on that‚Äù. 

‚ÄúWhat was their intent for this? There‚Äôs got to be some follow up or we would be told to keep calm and not talk about it‚Äù Daughtery said, leaning forward on the table. The man nodded ‚Äúcorrect, you would be‚Ä¶ the attack lines up with several others that have occurred within the last few months, all from this species. They would usually remain below crush depth, as seen by their physiology, but they‚Äôve not only come to the surface but are attacking ships. You are the first operational unit to encounter them and confirm their existence‚Äù. 

Chief leaned back ‚ÄúSo you know what we were getting into and gave us the narcos schtick?‚Äù. The man however didn‚Äôt relent ‚ÄúI had a theory, I sent you in there with the most actionable intel, you found an anomaly, Chief Shane Murphy. What happens now is up to the intestinal fortitude of you and your men‚Äù. 

‚ÄúThat being?‚Äù the captain asked. 

‚ÄúWe believe now that we know the species and a fresh example of how they attack ships, we can better coordinate and anticipate their next moves. Your unit is the most experienced having not only encountered but killed one. Some losses, yes-‚Äù he said, Chief didn‚Äôt like that as he sat forward. ‚ÄúSome? That was one of my fucking men‚Äù. 

The man fired back: ‚ÄúYes, one of several hundred that have been claimed and written off as storm casualties. You want to curve that number? You‚Äôre being assigned under me to help hunt down and stop these intrusions. Together, we are going to close the distance and get to the bottom of this‚Äù he said, taking a long drag. This is when I finally spoke up: ‚ÄúWho might you be?‚Äù. 

‚ÄúSpecial Agent ‚ÄòMiller‚Äô...‚Äù he said, locking eyes with me, the cold dead stare of a man who‚Äôs done more than a few questionable things for his country. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm part of a special joint task force, working name is ‚ÄòPexu‚Äô, no dossier, consider it like an Omega Deployment for the guys here who‚Äôve been around the block. I‚Äôve been assigned to see the violent conclusion of the qui tenebrosa aqua‚Äù. The pages of this file are lined with reports, missing people dragged to the depths, others torn to shreds with the autopsies all matching the same thing that nearly gut me.

‚ÄúDo we have an easier name?‚Äù one of the other squad leads asked. 

Miller rolled his eyes; ‚ÄúCommon term is ‚ÄòMermen‚Äô, however the moniker used everywhere from Mexico to Turkey is ‚ÄòSirens‚Äô‚Ä¶ two of the first written examples credited to the Irish and Greeks. Gentlemen it may seem fantastical, but the reality is anything but, in the 1970s a british military sub was nearly downed by a group of these, see page 18‚Ä¶‚Äù. Truth be told, I did ‚ÄòHMS Dreadnought S101‚Äô, severe damage that ruptured the body. If they could do this‚Ä¶ 

Daughtery was taken aback as he inquired ‚ÄúSo what‚Ä¶ they did this with their hands?‚Äù. 

Miller shook his head ‚ÄúNo, weapons similar to those found in your raid‚Ä¶ Page 6‚Äù. I flipped back to see the same spear that was stuck in the man, a full image with notes. I could hear Miller detail ‚Äúwhale bone, carved and fine tuned. You know how tough whale bone is captain?‚Äù. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôd say very tough‚Äù. 

‚ÄúWith the right force behind it, it could puncture steel. So‚Ä¶ is everyone taking this seriously?‚Äù the agent asked. The silent of 2 dozen seals all staring intently was his answer and the respect he wanted. ‚ÄúGood‚Ä¶ get some rest, don‚Äôt wander too far‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve got another objective, I‚Äôll be in touch‚Äù. With that‚Ä¶ he just picked up his file and walked out, leaving us to grieve and our minds to wonder about the future. 

We‚Äôve been convening amongst ourselves, this is completely out of the realm of anything we‚Äôve experienced but‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre marching head first together. I‚Äôve been tasked to keep this log updated until the conclusion or until my untimely demise. 

I‚Äôll be back with more soon.

Her *Festivities Flowchart* is spread across a table like a military battle map. In the distance, the *Founding Daddies* cover band massacres the intro to ‚ÄúFree Fallin‚Äô.‚Äù

Cassie sighs. Her playlist, titled **‚ÄúCivic Vibes: July Edition,‚Äù** plays gently from her phone‚Äîuntil a passing **parade llama** spooks, yanks its handler offscreen, and triggers a cascade of panicked honks from downtown.

Cassie doesn‚Äôt even flinch.

**CASSIE**  
(voice flat, into headset)  
Janine, we need a new llama handler. And someone stole the powdered wigs again. *Check April‚Äôs shed.*

She clicks her pen three times‚Äî*click click click*‚Äîthen stabs it into her ‚ÄúTBD‚Äù column.

Just then, **JACE CAMDEN** appears, haloed by late-morning sun and holding a mason jar of lemonade that glows like it‚Äôs been kissed by Zeus himself.

**JACE**  
Figured you could use a refill.  
(beat)  
You look like someone just told you the Liberty Bell *wasn‚Äôt* made in this town.

Cassie blinks. He‚Äôs infuriatingly calm. And *doesn‚Äôt sweat.*

**CASSIE**  
Thanks. I‚Äôll just add it to the ‚Äúexistential lemonade decisions‚Äù pile.

**JACE**  
That‚Äôs a big pile.

**CASSIE**  
And growing. Your stand is single-handedly destabilizing the lemonade economy. Do you *know* what the Girl Scouts are planning?

**JACE**  
(truly not concerned)  
I heard whispers of a lemon coup.

A beat as Cassie sips his lemonade, trying not to react emotionally to how good it is. She *fails.*

Just then, a *pickup truck backfires* down the street, followed by the sound of someone yelling ‚ÄúI TOLD YOU NOT TO LIGHT IT YET!‚Äù

**Cassie sighs.**

**CASSIE**  
If anyone asks, the town‚Äôs motto is *""We're fine.""*

**JACE**  
(raising his lemonade)  
To fine.

**Cassie clinks his jar with hers. A silent moment of connection‚Äîbroken immediately by the sound of a kazoo-led militia march starting too early across town.**

This ease of use saves time and reduces frustration, encouraging users to frequently visit and utilize the coupon resources. A well-designed interface also enhances the overall user experience, increasing the chances of repeat visits and positive word-of-mouth referrals.

**Real-Time Updates:** The best ufo coupon platforms provide real-time updates on new deals and expiring offers, ensuring that users have access to the most current information.

This feature is crucial for staying ahead of the competition and securing the best discounts before they disappear.

By constantly refreshing their database, these platforms maintain their relevance and value to consumers who are always looking for the latest savings opportunities.

**Mobile Accessibility:** Many ufo coupon providers offer mobile apps or mobile-optimized websites, enabling users to access and redeem coupons on the go.

This mobile accessibility caters to the modern consumer's lifestyle, allowing them to find and use coupons anytime, anywhere. Mobile apps often include additional features like location-based deals and barcode scanning, further enhancing the user experience. The convenience of having coupons at their fingertips encourages spontaneous purchases and increased savings.

 ## Core Benefits

Ufo coupons provide a multitude of benefits to consumers, enhancing their purchasing power and overall shopping experience.

**Significant Cost Savings:** Utilizing ufo coupons can lead to substantial savings on a wide range of products and services, allowing consumers to stretch their budgets further.

For instance, a 20% discount on a major appliance or a buy-one-get-one-free offer on a popular restaurant meal can result in considerable savings over time. These savings can be particularly beneficial for families on a tight budget or individuals looking to maximize their discretionary income. The cumulative effect of using ufo coupons regularly can significantly reduce overall spending.

**Access to Exclusive Offers:** Many ufo coupons provide access to exclusive deals and promotions that are not available to the general public, giving users a competitive advantage.

These exclusive offers might include early access to sales, special discounts for members, or bundled deals that offer greater value than individual purchases. By leveraging these exclusive offers, consumers can secure better prices and access unique products or services that would otherwise be unavailable. This sense of exclusivity enhances the perceived value of ufo coupons and encourages ongoing usage.

**Encourages Trying New Products:** Ufo coupons often feature discounts on new or unfamiliar products, encouraging consumers to step outside their comfort zones and explore new options.

This can lead to the discovery of new favorites and expanded horizons. For example, a coupon for a new brand of coffee or a discounted trial of a streaming service can introduce consumers to products they might not have otherwise considered. This willingness to try new things can enhance their overall consumer experience and lead to unexpected discoveries.

**Supports Local Businesses:** Many ufo coupon platforms focus on promoting deals from local businesses, helping to support the community and boost the local economy.

By using these coupons, consumers can directly contribute to the success of their neighborhood shops, restaurants, and service providers.

Choosing ufo coupons from local businesses allows consumers to make a positive impact while saving money.

**Simplifies Budgeting:** By providing clear discounts and offers, ufo coupons can help consumers better plan their spending and stick to their budgets.

Knowing in advance what discounts are available allows consumers to allocate their funds more effectively and avoid impulse purchases. Using ufo coupons as part of a budgeting strategy can provide greater control over finances and reduce financial stress. This proactive approach to spending empowers consumers to make informed decisions and achieve their financial goals.

1jypusu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jypusu/falling_for_my_drum_instructor_trying_to_stay/,"falling for my drum instructor, trying to stay grounded??","So a little over four weeks ago, I posted on a local app looking for beginner drum lessons. A drum instructor reached out, we connected, and I went to my first lesson‚Äîand oh my gosh, he‚Äôs gorgeous. But more importantly, he‚Äôs kind, respectful, accommodating, and we just click. We have a really similar sense of humor, and there‚Äôs a natural ease between us.

By lesson two, I had practiced a ton, came in feeling confident, and the lesson was amazing. Same with lesson three. I‚Äôm heading into my fourth session now. We text sometimes (mostly about drumming), but in person we smile a lot, and he‚Äôs started to open up about his family, work, and life. He spends most of his time either playing drums or working as a drum tech, and from what I can tell, he‚Äôs single.

During one of our conversations, we talked about our families‚Äîhow old our parents are and what they‚Äôre like. Somewhere in there, I snuck in a little joke about him being a ‚Äúdinosaur‚Äù because of the age gap (he‚Äôs 51, I‚Äôm 38), and we both chuckled. I just wanted to acknowledge the difference without making it a thing. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs too old at all‚Äîbut I also wanted to put him at ease and let him know I‚Äôm aware of it and totally cool with it.

He‚Äôs told me he really appreciates my drive and how seriously I‚Äôm taking the lessons. I even asked if he‚Äôd want to grab a coffee sometime‚ÄîI said I felt like I owed him for being so patient and encouraging. He responded kindly, said I definitely don‚Äôt owe him anything, but maybe when he‚Äôs not so busy, we could meet up. I asked mostly because I genuinely want to connect with him more outside of lessons. I felt a little rejected. Should I not think anything of it? Trying not to üòÇ

During our most recent session, we actually smoked a little weed beforehand (nothing wild, just enough to loosen up, totally my idea, and he said he does the same) and it really helped me relax. It made the lesson smoother and more fun‚ÄîI was more in my body, less in my head, and we were laughing and vibing in a way that just felt really easy. I actually started playing all of the drums and all of the symbols that lesson.

And now‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him. But I also don‚Äôt want to get ahead of myself or build up expectations. I‚Äôm super proud of myself for picking up drums, investing in my confidence, and doing something that‚Äôs just for me. I just don‚Äôt want to get so wrapped up in this connection that I lose sight of that.

So‚Äîhow do I stay grounded in my own growth while acknowledging the fact that this connection is starting to mean something to me? Has anyone else navigated feelings like this when starting something new with someone they‚Äôre drawn to? How do I stay focused on my drumming progress and also keep the window open for romantic opportunity but not set my hopes up?",1,1744602629.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Finally got a chance to sit-in this weekend. So I sat for 2 hours upon waking both Saturday and Sunday. It was tough as the gravitational pull of my busy mind was screaming coffee! But I resisted. And just sat. Not necessarily the best focus, awareness, etc. My mind wandered here and there before I coaxed it back to the breath. At the 2 hour spot I wanted sit another 2! But my gf was now ready for her coffee. She cooks, I am the coffee gopher. So I got up and got the coffee. 
Anyways, starting both weekend days this way resulted in a relatively blissful weekend. It was amazing weather so that obviously helps but the real pleasure was my keen awareness and gratitude for it. The sitting involved some struggle but that struggle came with some pretty tangible benefits that have been spread throughout the day. 
So if you are wondering if more = better, yeah... in a lot of ways it does. Even if the mind is busy and won't focus on anything,  at least having the body in relatively static posture has its own benefits. Overall I would equate the feeling to microdosing but 100% stable.

One sleepy Sunday, Midoriya was innocently grading papers (with only mild PTSD) when a very unfortunate tab auto-filled in his browser:

He shouldn‚Äôt have clicked it.

Midoriya, after reading:
‚Äú‚Ä¶Why do I make soba noodles in an apron while Mirko glares at me and calls me her ‚Äògood little homemaker‚Äô??‚Äù

The fic had 78,000 kudos.

He scrolled further.

There was another one: ‚ÄúNumber Five Hero Ryukyu and Her Sweet Stay-at-Home Izuku‚Äù

> he folds laundry

she bench-presses him

he brings her tea after patrol

she calls him ‚Äúmy squishy stress toy‚Äù

Midoriya once found a hyperrealistic fanart of himself in pink oven mitts, kissing Mt. Lady on the cheek while holding a casserole dish labeled ‚ÄúHero Fuel Casserole ‚Äì with Love.‚Äù

He stared at it for a long time.

> ‚ÄúWhy‚Ä¶ why do they draw me with such childbearing hips‚Ä¶?‚Äù



Bakugo nearly choked when he saw it.

> ‚ÄúTHEY GAVE YOU EYELASHES. I‚ÄôM NOT OKAY.‚Äù

Then came the collabs.

One artist and one writer teamed up to create a 43-chapter slow burn manga where Midoriya is the doting husband of Lady Nagant, who uses her sniper rifle to protect his homemade garden.

He bakes.
She snipes.
Together? Goals.

Midoriya tried to get Aizawa to make an announcement about the fan content.

Aizawa said:

> ‚ÄúYou brought this on yourself the day you started reading them. I warned you. Now shut up and grade.‚Äù

Ochako tried to cheer him up.

A sad emoji over the phrase ‚Äúbaby girl of the pro hero world‚Äù

A screenshot of a fic titled ‚ÄúBunny‚Äôs Good Boy: A Domestic Deku Saga‚Äù with him screaming in the background

Meanwhile, the fanbase continues growing.

There‚Äôs merch.
There‚Äôs a fan-made cooking game app.
There‚Äôs even a coffee shop AU spin-off where Izuku runs a bakery and all the female pros are regulars who flirt badly.

We met in uni and its been 3 years since we met. Last relationship I had was kinda traumatic (he broke up w/me bc of long distance and he was the first guy I got intimate with) for me so I was reluctant to get into another relationship. I‚Äôve been single for 3 years and I only went 4 dates to coffee shops.

For the past few months we were kinda joking with each other platonically (or so I thought) but he said he was serious all this time and he was attracted to me. Few weeks ago we met after a while and decided why not go on with this arrangement since we were both craving physical intimacy.

He started talking more about relationship stuff and he started to messaging me more than usual (we mostly send each other funny stuff on ig and tw). He recently bought a bike and he said he wanted to get me a customized helmet only for me to use with cute stuff but I said to him he doesn‚Äôt need to spend his money on something like that just for me and he insisted for a while and eventually stopped asking for it for now. But he was kinda sad when I turned him down. He is also studying for masters program and he said that he is not going to have a relationship for that time period (for two years).

I feel like he is trying to make me convince to be in a relationship with him in the future and thats why he is making these plans and commitments. Maybe he is hoping that we might be in a relationship if we get intimate and spend more time together but I don‚Äôt feel that way. We already agreed on to not catch feelings but I feel like he likes me romantically.

We met in uni and its been 3 years since we met.

I‚Äôve been single for 3 years and I only went 4 dates to coffee shops.

For the past few months we were kinda joking with each other platonically (or so I thought) but he said he was serious all this time and he was attracted to me. Few weeks ago we met after a while and decided why not go on with this arrangement since we were both craving physical intimacy.

He started talking more about relationship stuff and he started to messaging me more than usual (we mostly send each other funny stuff on ig and tw). He recently bought a bike and he said he wanted to get me a customized helmet only for me to use with cute stuff but I said to him he doesn‚Äôt need to spend his money on something like that just for me and he insisted for a while and eventually stopped asking for it for now. But he was kinda sad when I turned him down. He is also studying for masters program and he said that he is not going to have a relationship for that time period (for two years).

I feel like he is trying to make me convince to be in a relationship with him in the future and thats why he is making these plans and commitments. Maybe he is hoping that we might be in a relationship if we get intimate and spend more time together but I don‚Äôt feel that way.

I could use some advice. I live in South Korea with my wife and two children. I‚Äôm 40m and American, my wife is 34f and Korean. The main issue is that my wife seems to be okay undermining and disrespecting me.

Here is some background. I run a teaching business, and I handle all day-to-day stuff. I handle the teaching, lesson planning, and dealing with the students. Sometimes my wife helps me with things such as helping me find a new space, meeting with realtor, or handling phone calls. Since I‚Äôm usually booked up my wife will field phone calls throughout the day. It‚Äôs usually about 1 hour of work for her or less. But most of the time I‚Äôm here 10 or 12 hours a day and most days my wife just stays at home and talks with the occasional customer.

This past year we have had issue with out landlord in our business space. There was a leak in our ceiling. My wife and I were upset, but my wife wanted to take this chance as an opportunity to try and make the landlord pay over a grand in fees. We had an old coffee machine, and the landlord offered to replace. My wife wanted to go meet with lawyers etc. The next step is she wanted to pile up a bunch of garbage in our business to try and prove a case against the landlord.

Here‚Äôs the deal... I made 140,000 last year with this business. I put a lot of time and effort in building things up. My wife has become consumed with winning this fight. For me, the most important thing is doing what is best for my business. I must try and provide for my children.¬† I have students come here. I can‚Äôt just allow trash to build up to try and win a possible court case for a few thousand dollars. It just makes no sense. I just try to swallow my ego and realize that this situation isn‚Äôt winnable. It just isn‚Äôt. She called me a loser for cleaning up the garbage. She says I don‚Äôt understand business and she say I‚Äôm not a businessman.

Recently the wife continued the war against our landlord. We share a bathroom space with the tenants next door. The landlord asked me for the bathroom pass so I just told her to move on with my business. My wife became enraged at me. She said I was ‚Äú s\*it and I don‚Äôt support her. She knows I‚Äôm studying for my MBA and she basically threw that in my face.

My wife has a habit of also allowing her parents to come into her home and basically let them arrange our home. She seems to have no respect for me and let‚Äôs them do what they want. For example, my kids were having an issue because of our daycare owner. I went down in person to talk to the owners during my lunch break. But her dad got involved over the phone and talked to the owner for like a minute. My wife says her dad was helpful. See the undermining ?

Recently my wife flat out told me she thinks she can do better than me. My wife is very vindictive and I‚Äôm afraid she will try and use my children against me. ¬†",0,1744601727.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

We met in uni and its been 3 years since we met. Last relationship I had was kinda traumatic (he broke up w/me bc of long distance and he was the first guy I got intimate with) for me so I was reluctant to get into another relationship. I‚Äôve been single for 3 years and I only went 4 dates to coffee shops. 

For the past few months we were kinda joking with each other platonically (or so I thought) but he said he was serious all this time and he was attracted to me. I told him I understood his moves as a joke because he was talking/hooking up with other girls and I have no interest to guys like that. I told him that I didn‚Äôt want to get into a relationship and he already knew that but he said our friendship dynamic was kinda distorted and we both wanted someone to get close with (like kissing and stuff). We stopped meeting for two months because of this issue and only talked in messages. 

Few weeks ago we met after a while and decided why not go on with this arrangement since we were both craving physical intimacy. 

The problem is I feel like he is in love with me and only agreed to be FWB because I am not interested in relationships. He knows I am a virgin (only got intimate with other stuff with ex bf) but he is confident that it will change. I have strict rules about intimacy and not comfortable with doing it. But he says it‚Äôs okay and we will see when timing is right. We setup some rules to not hookup w/other people or talk with them, or if we met someone we will stop talking immediately and go back to being friends. No dating apps or whatsoever. But ofc if we decided to find someone we will tell each other and stop this thing right away. He says that he is not interested in anyone rn and has no intention downloading dating apps. I told him I might want to meet someone if I am ready for a relationship and he was kinda hurt and got weird that I am thinking about downloading dating apps etc. He said that I can make any rules and he is fine with anything because he feels like I might stop this if I get uncomfortable. So he told me to be the decision maker for everything and he will just follow my lead (He said bc I was talking about negative scenarios of what might happen he thought I wanted to end things with him).

He started talking more about relationship stuff and he started to messaging me more than usual (we mostly send each other funny stuff on ig and tw). He recently bought a bike and he said he wanted to get me a customized helmet only for me to use with cute stuff but I said to him he doesn‚Äôt need to spend his money on something like that just for me and he insisted for a while and eventually stopped asking for it for now.

In hopes that the community might know of or can keep an eye out for examples or more info in the future so they can share it here. 

Gaps in the [Logo timeline](https://www.reddit.com/r/Carhartt/s/HI5fiPQkJk) 

That logo timeline is the one from the archive I added some notes to and it covers most of the main logos but is far from comprehensive. It lacks many variations like the slight differences for different products in the same time period. Lots of the info is vauge and the exact dates could be more precise. 

Missing colors in the [Color list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Carhartt/comments/szhe0p/guide_to_color_codes_throughout_the_years/) the list is fairly comprehensive but it does have some gaps or mysteries. It is a bit confusing since they are somewhat based on the oldest colors use the lowest codes since they were given out as needed but some of the older codes got reused for other colors if they were not used for a while. Some were done in batches so groups of codes can be related to a certain time period. The code system has roots going back over 100 years and can be a bit random and confusing. The ones I am most interested in are any uses of 0-10 , the gap of 10-13, and colors we have no documentation for like mud or bronze. Any undocumented colors are fun tho so if you find any share them on the sub or in the comments of the color list. Our info on early wip colors is also very lacking so any new info is welcome.

Gaps in product codes

This one is a bit vauge but as an example say we know they made a j121 and a j123 but can't find any record of a j122 ever existing. It is possible with his or gaps in colors codes they just skipped that one but there are lots of confusing gaps in that code system.

Lists of exclusives

Some companies get exclusive products only they sell. It can be a color like storm cloud blue, slightly tweaked product like this [Dual logo beanie from dunagrees](https://dungarees.com/carhartt-102661-carhartt-x-dungarees-watch-hat?srsltid=AfmBOorRAzi63aykLJWzsTGMOZ6KE6iDJC59VoNVsSxCQmvVnbOdV0ym) , or a style like the [Tractor supply traditional jacket](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/carhartt-mens-exclusive-tsc-dat-jacket-104480-1485164?store=1922&cid=Google-Shopping-Sustain&utm_medium=Google&utm_source=Shopping&utm_content=Sustain&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwwe2_BhBEEiwAM1I7scgrl7mIqAldbftBUI8yAtuluA-4J11BWX-5Qx0z4JzVlKXCJUYX5BoCYi0QAvD_BwE) I know of many from the last 15 years or so but they are usually not well documented as at best you will see an old Facebook ad or listing. Some don't even have that much, especially older ones. The sub does a pretty good job of keeping up to date with current exclusives as they are easier to learn about due to better marketing.

Hunting items records

Any sources like catalogs or old ads is very limited. They don't show up in most of the catalogs we have access to and seem to be sold more directly to hunting goods suppliers. The hunting line is also infamous for randomly shutting down and starting up without much warning. It wasn't unusual to see a hunting jacket I had never seen or heard of show up in a store and be gone a year or 2 later never to be seen again. We have made some progress with the wayback machine on older hunting goods sites but it only goes back so far. Any new sources would be greatly appreciated because info on hunting products in particular is very lacking

Records for trade specific items

Painters whites, hickory/railroad stripe, and other trade specific uniforms don't usually show up in catalogs, Ads, or other usual sources of info we use. This makes dating products, details of changes to designs over time, or knowing when they started or stopped making them extra hard. Any new sources or examples would be welcome.

Carhartt military gear

We know carhartt made military clothing for ww1 and ww2. There is some documentation and examples thanks to war memorabilia enthusiasts but I have only seen one example of pants from ww1 and part of a unform from ww2. I am unsure exactly what or how much was produced of any of it but am sure we are missing some things like examples for the ww2 jungle suits. They also have some more recent military usage thru a company they purchased called proftech . Like a jumpsuit for the Dutch navy and bomber jacket we have examples of [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Carhartt/comments/m3vjzx/other_names_and_brands_carhartt_has_used_over_the/)

World War 2 women's workwear

Carhartt has said in a few history blurbs they made women's workwear but i have never seen any examples. It is possible they aren't marked any differently than the men's workwear at the time so until we get some examples everything is unknown.

Early Japanese imports. 

Carhartt has said before that the Japanese market was the first to import Carhartt for the fashion market starting around 1987. Aside from that we don't know much except for some examples that have Japanese writing and seems to be from the period after wip started but before wip took over the Japanese market. At least they are different from any wip we know of from the same time period or japan excluse. The items were often retro in design so are often mistaken for much older items. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Carhartt/comments/1eklzbm/carhartt_japan_exclusive/#lightbox) is an example of tag style. We have some examples but no documentation aside from a start date. 

Early wip imports and colors

We have documented a fair amount of them and have a color list from 1995 the first year but aside from the color sand we don't have good examples of the other colors not part of the normal American lineup at the time like tobacco, army, and coffee. Some of them can look pretty close to more common colors and can be easy to miss. It seems like they might have all shared the same color code for the first year so any new documentation would help clear up some details.

Products we have no examples of

The [Surfer shorts](https://imgur.com/a/o5NnWm9) and other unknown products from the wild experimental period during the 1960's.

The [Scottfoam](https://imgur.com/a/gcmvfLv) lining. It is pretty well documented but I have never seen any examples. They likely didn't wear or age well being foam so may have been thrown away more than other styles at the time. Also less likely to show up for sale if they are falling apart. Would still love o confirm it with an example.

Many pre 1970 styles have only one or no examples of. It is very hit or miss with what shows up online. If you find anything interesting and are unsure share just to be safe.



This isn't a complete list of everything we are missing just all the ones I could think of at the moment. I left out a lot of specific examples like j202 in favor of a general overview. If anyone would like to do a deep dive on anything listed above or any topics in general you can message me for a run down or a link to any relevant sources we have access to. The group of people actively searching for this kind of info is small and getting smaller so I wanted to reach out and see if anyone would be interested in making it more of a group effort. It seems much easier for many folks to keep an eye out for certain things instead of just a few hunting them down. I may update this or make another post like this if it goes well.

He is genuinely very sweet. I‚Äôve come to the decision that I want to break up with him for personal reasons on top of just the simple fact that I am just not ready for a relationship. He deserves someone who can give him their all, and I‚Äôm just not that person as I‚Äôm wanting to focus on myself and my career at this point in time. 

This is a decision I‚Äôm firm on. My only issue is I‚Äôm just not quite sure how, where or when to do it. I work two jobs, one morning and one night job, on top of schooling. We work together at my night job most days of the week, so I‚Äôm aware I will have to deal with the aftermath of that in the work environment. 
He lives about 40 minutes away, and he only ever comes to my house- I‚Äôve only gone to his house once in our relationship, per his request. He still lives with his family, so he had always preferred to come over to my house, so I feel like showing up at his house to do it is not an option.

I don‚Äôt want to do it at work, and I don‚Äôt want to make him drive all the way to my house just for me to break up with him. I would prefer to do it in person, I absolutely refuse to do it over text, but perhaps calling might be an option? We could meet somewhere at a coffee shop or the likes, but I don‚Äôt want to do it in a public space as he is a very empathetic person, and I know this would break him, so I want him to be able to process this devastating news in private.

Part of the new role will involve me traveling up to 20% of the time to my company‚Äôs other locations which are scattered in my state and some surrounding ones. We‚Äôre talking trips like 2-5 hour drives for the most part. The areas I‚Äôd be going would be fairly unremarkable suburban metro areas. The biggest place I‚Äôd go to would possibly be Kansas City. 

As for my wife, she‚Äôs self employed and works from home. So she gets tired of working within the same 4 walls which I understand (I was remote too before this new job). 

When I told her about the travel for my new job, she immediately says she wants to come and that she can bring her laptop and work out of a local coffee house while I‚Äôm doing my job. I think she views these trips as an excuse for a mini-getaway where we could do something in the evenings or possibly stay extra days. I love her but this rubs me the wrong way. 

For starters, I have no interest working all day in an off-site location and then trying to find something to do on weekday evenings together just because we‚Äôre in an area different than the norm. Honestly I‚Äôd rather just chill in a hotel room. Reminder that for the most part these areas I‚Äôd be in are nothing exciting either. I don‚Äôt think she quite gets that.

Also, even though my work would be paying for my hotel and the food I eat, that wouldn‚Äôt apply to her. Plus there could be other expenses like Uber fees for her if I have the car during the day. I‚Äôd rather us save the money for an actual small weekend trip we could both fully enjoy. And I‚Äôm not sure I feel comfortable having my new work pay for a hotel room and basically having my wife stay there for free without telling them. 

What really kind of irked me about all this though is she never even asked me how I felt about it. She basically just invited herself from the get go and I‚Äôve sort of waived it off so far by saying ‚Äúwell let‚Äôs just see how my job goes‚Äù but I feel like we‚Äôll need to talk about it more at some point. Whenever I‚Äôve been telling someone about my new job she‚Äôll jump in and say how she wants to/is planning on coming with me on trips as if that‚Äôs the only thing that matters to her.

Back in my stay-out-late days, along with Norm's and Harbor House Cafe, it was a welcome alternative to Denny's.  I think it went by Jon's Coffee Shop when my family first moved to the area back in '88.  I was always a semi-regular but did a long stretch of visiting once a week, bringing my L.A. Times every Sunday to enjoy at the counter seating with my standard order of ""John Wayne's Favorite"".  They did not seem to recover from Covid and it was sad to watch a business that meant so much to me close shop.

1jypdc3,https://i.redd.it/xdvttoa9ypue1.jpeg,"Gaggia to Decent or LM - Latte Drinker [$7,000]","Looking for some buying advice after a lot of lurking and research. Gaggia Classic to a LM Mini/Micra or a Decent? 

Background:
2.5 year Gaggia Classic/Urbanic 080 user. I've traveled a lot and tried a lot of great cafes (lived overseas in Korea which as you probably know, has a really great coffee scene). I do enjoy the occasional Americano, but I find I drink 90% cortados and lattes as my daily driver. I'm pretty keen to what is ""good"" and what isn't according to my likes, but the talks of the real subtle details of ""clarity, minute notes, etc etc"" is a little lost on me. I like to dabble in various medium-dark roast speciality coffees (haven't gotten into light roasts and not sure if I will), and I appreciate getting consistent results within each bag most of all.  

Looking to upgrade due to some of the inconsistencies with the Gaggia (9 bar is the only mod). The cup to cup difference even with milk drinks is noticable even with my less than expert palette. I'm confident that my prep work and dailing in abilities are fairly well developed. 

If money isn't a large factor, do you think I would appreciate the LM or a Decent more? Quick heat up time is very attractive. I don't really care between a tablet and a more tactile experience. As long as it works, it's consistent, and is reliable. 
Grinder will also be upgraded to either a niche or weber most likely. Urbanic retention is rather frustrating even with the bellows.

Check out Grosche (Cambridge, ON)","I just wanted to share a fantastic Canadian company I came across (or maybe some of you already know them!): Grosche. They're based in Cambridge, Ontario.

I was searching for a new insulated water bottle and was hoping to find a Canadian-made or Canadian-owned option. Stumbled upon Grosche and was super impressed!

They have a pretty wide range of drinkware:

* Insulated Stainless Steel Bottles Keep drinks cold for ages (like 24+ hours) and hot for up to 12. They come in different sizes and lid types (flasks, sports lids, straw lids).
* Glass Bottles: Borosilicate glass options, some with protective sleeves.
* Infuser Bottles: Great for adding fruit or tea to your water.
* Coffee/Tea Gear: They offer a wide range of products, including bottles (French presses, pour-overs, etc.), all with a focus on quality.

Everything seems well-made and is BPA-free.

Beyond supporting a Canadian business, Grosche's social mission sealed the deal for me. Grosche is a certified B Corp, and for every product sold, they fund 50+ days of safe drinking water for people in need through their Safe Water Project. I love seeing a Canadian company making a tangible positive impact like that!

I've organized drives for the men's shelter, fixed a boardwalk, held a weekly free breakfast for the homeless etc. Its good work for the world (Barely drops in the ocean if we're honest) though in truth I'm mostly in it for the attention and a shot at The Chairman Position‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. Recently, A got tired of hearing me brag, now he's tagging along for most of my meetings. He says he just wants to be ""politically active"" and ""Part of the Solution"". I can tell he's lying, he's in it for the same reason as me: The Chairman Position‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

The Chairman Position: 12 hrs a week ""Organizing and Volunteer advising"" aka: delegating to the rest of comittee, $1500 a month (untaxed, non-profit, classified as donation)

Tentatively I'm to be the chairman since I aggressively claimed it and constantly prove I'm worthy of it. (Elections are the End of May stay tuned). I've launched 3 successful events independently, and 2 with community partnership. As far as the Committee and the Community are concerned I'm a saint. In truth im prone to weird, needlessly sinful antics. I lie because its funny. I sleep with who I can when I can. I steal because I know I'll get away with it (but also 3.25 for a Reeses is insane). I tell every returant its my birthday. I hide from most people, but not A. He always rolls his eyes and accepts the second peanut butter cup or awkwardly sings ""Happy Birthday"". 

A and I led a committe meeting today. He didnt speak much at the last one. Today when I picked him up he looked amazing, per always. He's usually dressed in something anachronistic. Like he came from a different decade but not one you could name. Early into the meeting I passed the facilitator role to him when I got up to grab a coffee. Last time he floundered. This time, I couldn't help but grin. He didn't let anyone inturrupt him, he sounded like a leader. I didn't let him keep the spotlight long. But Hesitated before taking it back. He looked so comfortable in the light. We're still discussing summer plans, but we need funding, I've assigned everyone homework to contact a black church (everyone on the committee is white we need more members and perspectives), find me a Memorial day idea, and beg someone for money.

On our way back to my place I let A pick the music. He'd earned it after all. We settled on Fuckboy music, Chase Atlantic 'Into It'. Midway through the saxophone solo he qued up a song, Unfortunately he became the observer to the consequences of my actions. I got a rather explicit Text from an unsaved number. 

Two weeks ago I met a guy at his apartment. I watched him drink listened to him talk ad nauseam about how he was one of the boys, How Jordan Peterson isn't that bad, how he was disappointed there were so many Muslims in London. I wish I could say I called him out and blocked his number but as we've established I'm a horny freak.

I had told A enough of the events that he put two and two together and asked me plainly if I had knowingly slept with a Fox News Enjoyer. I admitted to it. He, Rightfully, shamed me but couldn't keep a straight face. I tried to play it off like it was funny but more than anything I was mortified. 

I always joke that I'm a wretched little gremlin. A is starting to see how true that statement actually is. I'm usually so confident, so quick to take what I want. But I'm afraid to try with him. Part of me is still trying to reconcile with his gender. Part of me is still trying to figure out what the hell romance is. Most of me knows I'm ill equipped to be a partner.

Hey there! Alex Rivera here from Tampa. After 8+ years of building WordPress websites along Florida's sun-soaked coastline, I've learned a thing or two about what makes the Sunshine State's web development scene unique. Whether you're a fellow developer looking to break into this market or a business owner searching for the right WordPress pro, I'm excited to share some insider perspectives that you won't find in your typical tech blog.

# The Florida Web Development Scene: Sun, Sand, and Servers

Florida's web development landscape is as diverse as its population. Unlike the tech bubbles of Silicon Valley or New York, our industry has a distinctly regional flavor that reflects our unique business environment.

The Florida market is fascinating - we're not just building websites; we're creating digital experiences for tourism operators competing for vacation dollars, real estate firms selling the Florida dream, and local businesses that surge and ebb with the seasonal population shifts.

What makes us different from developers in tech hubs like Austin or Seattle? For one, we understand hurricane season isn't just about boarding up windows‚Äîit's about ensuring websites stay operational when physical locations might not be. We also grasp the bilingual nature of many Florida businesses, especially in South Florida where Spanish language support isn't just nice-to-have, it's essential.

As one client told me last year, ""Alex, I need a website that works as hard as I do, even when I'm evacuated inland."" That's uniquely Florida, isn't it?

# Why Choose a Local Florida WordPress Developer?

Ever tried explaining to an out-of-state developer why your beachside restaurant needs a real-time red tide update feature? Or why your real estate site needs to highlight flood zone information prominently? These are the nuances that make working with a local Florida developer invaluable.

When you partner with a Florida-based WordPress expert, you're getting someone who:

* Understands the seasonal nature of many Florida businesses
* Knows how to optimize for local search in highly competitive tourist markets
* Can build with our unique weather challenges in mind (hurricane preparedness features, anyone?)
* Appreciates the importance of page load speed in an area where mobile usage dominates desktop
* Gets the cultural diversity that makes marketing in Florida different

Just last month, I met with a new client at a coffee shop in St. Petersburg rather than over Zoom. That face-to-face connection allowed me to really understand their vision in a way that's hard to replicate virtually. Would they have gotten that with an overseas developer or even someone from California? Probably not.

# Services That Set Florida WordPress Developers Apart

The services offered by WordPress developers like myself here in Florida often extend beyond what you might expect. Sure, we build beautiful, functional websites, but there's more to our toolkit:

# Custom WordPress Development with Local Flair

We don't just implement themes; we create custom solutions that speak to Florida audiences. This might mean developing specialized property search functionality for real estate clients or interactive tide calendars for fishing charters.

# Weather-Resilient Hosting Solutions

After seeing too many clients lose business during hurricane season, I've developed specialized hosting packages with redundant backups across different geographic regions. If a storm hits Tampa, your site stays up because it's also supported by servers well outside the impact zone.

# Multilingual Implementation

With our diverse population, many Florida businesses need seamless language switching. I've implemented sophisticated, multilingual solutions that go beyond simple translation plugins, ensuring cultural nuances are respected.

# Local SEO Domination

The competition for terms like ""best beach hotel in Florida"" or ""top Miami restaurant"" is fierce. We've developed specialized SEO approaches for WordPress that help local businesses compete against national chains and booking platforms.

# Tourism-Focused E-commerce

From selling beach gear to booking fishing charters, Florida e-commerce has unique requirements. Our WooCommerce implementations often include season-aware pricing, weather-dependent availability, and mobile-first checkout processes designed for visitors using hotel WiFi.

# <<< [Transform Your Vision Into Reality ‚Üí Get Your Custom WordPress Site Now](https://coderlift.com/services/wordpress-development/) >>>

# The Industries We Serve: Not Your Average Client List

My agency's client roster reads like a cross-section of Florida's economy:

**Tourism & Hospitality**: From boutique beachside B&Bs to major resort properties, these clients need booking systems that convert, virtual tours that impress, and content that ranks for those precious ""Florida vacation"" searches.

**Real Estate & Property Management**: With Florida's booming housing market, these clients need property showcase websites that load fast, filter effectively, and capture leads before competitors do.

**Marine Businesses**: Fishing charters, boat rentals, and marina services all need specialized functionality‚Äîlike tide tables, weather integrations, and seasonal availability calendars.

**Professional Services with a Sunshine Twist**: Law firms specializing in hurricane insurance claims. Accountants focusing on Florida's retiree tax advantages. Medical practices catering to seasonal residents. They all need WordPress sites that speak to these specialized audiences.

Last year, I built a site for a kayak tour company operating in the Everglades. They needed a booking system that automatically adjusted tour availability based on weather forecasts and seasonal wildlife patterns. That's not something you'll find in a standard WordPress template, but it's exactly the kind of customization that Florida businesses need.

# Our Development Process: The Florida Way

When I started my agency in Tampa after relocating from Miami, I brought with me a development process refined for Florida businesses:

# Discovery: Beyond the Basics

Our discovery sessions don't just cover website goals‚Äîwe discuss hurricane preparedness, seasonal business fluctuations, and competitive analysis specific to Florida markets. I'll often ask clients: ""How does your business change between January and July?"" The answers drive important design decisions.

# Design: Capturing Florida's Aesthetic

There's a certain look and feel that works here‚Äîit's not all palm trees and flamingos (though sometimes it is!), but there's definitely a ""Florida aesthetic"" that resonates with both locals and visitors. Our design process respects this while avoiding the tacky tourist trap clich√©s.

# <<< [Transform Your Vision Into Reality ‚Üí Get Your Custom WordPress Site Now](https://coderlift.com/services/wordpress-development/) >>>

# Development: Built to Last in Our Climate

Beyond standard WordPress best practices, we build with Florida in mind. This means:

* Server-side caching optimized for visitor spikes during peak season
* Advanced CDN implementation to handle the distance between Florida and major internet exchanges
* Lightweight code that performs well on hotel WiFi and cellular networks
* Backup systems designed to weather literal storms

# Launch and Support: Present When You Need Us

Being in the same time zone and geographical area means we can provide support when our clients need it most. During emergency situations like hurricane warnings, we've been known to make emergency website updates from evacuation zones using mobile hotspots. That's the dedication you simply won't get from an overseas development team.

# Case Studies: Florida Success Stories

Let me share a few real examples (with names changed for privacy) that showcase the unique work we do:

# Seaside Suites: Booking Independence Achieved

A family-owned beachfront hotel in Clearwater was losing 25% of its revenue to online travel agency commissions. We built them a custom WordPress site with a direct booking system that increased their direct reservations by 45% in six months. The key was a mobile-first design that made booking on the phone even easier than using the big travel sites.

# Gulf Coast Properties: From Paperwork to Digital Efficiency

A mid-sized real estate firm was drowning in paperwork. Their agents were spending hours on administrative tasks instead of showing properties. We developed a custom WordPress implementation that integrated with their CRM, automatically generated property pages, and provided a portal for clients to schedule viewings. The result? A 30% reduction in administrative work and a 20% increase in agent productivity.

# Storm-Ready Network: Community Safety Through Technology

After a particularly bad hurricane season, I created a plugin that's now used by several community organizations across Florida. It integrates with emergency weather services to automatically display evacuation notices, shelter information, and storm tracking on WordPress sites. During the last major hurricane, these sites served over 50,000 residents with critical information when other communication channels failed.

# Technology Stack: What Works in Florida

Our technology choices are influenced by our unique environment:

# Hosting Solutions

We favor hosts with data centers both in Florida (for speed) and well outside hurricane zones (for reliability). Our typical setup includes:

* Primary hosting in Florida data centers
* Backup systems in the Midwest or West Coast
* CDN services to ensure visitors from both domestic and international locations get fast-loading pages

# Essential Plugins for Florida Businesses

Beyond the standard WordPress toolkit, we regularly implement:

* Advanced weather API integrations
* Multi-currency plugins for international tourists
* Specialized local SEO tools focused on competitive Florida markets
* Translation systems that handle Spanish, Portuguese, and French (for our Canadian winter visitors)

# Mobile Optimization

With tourism driving so much of Florida's economy, mobile optimization isn't just important‚Äîit's essential. Over 70% of our clients' traffic comes from mobile devices, often from visitors using unfamiliar networks. Our mobile-first approach ensures these users have a seamless experience.

# <<< [Transform Your Vision Into Reality ‚Üí Get Your Custom WordPress Site Now](https://coderlift.com/services/wordpress-development/) >>>

# The Cost Factor: Investing in Florida-Specific Expertise

Website development pricing in Florida reflects our specialized knowledge and the unique challenges of this market. While you might find cheaper developers elsewhere, consider what you're getting with a local expert:

# Typical Project Ranges

* Basic WordPress site with Florida-specific SEO: $3,000-5,000
* Custom tourism or real estate solution: $7,000-15,000
* Enterprise-level multilingual site with custom functionality: $15,000-25,000+

# Ongoing Support

Most of our clients choose monthly maintenance packages ranging from $150-500 depending on their needs. These include hurricane season preparations, seasonal content updates, and performance optimization during peak tourist periods.

Is it worth paying more for a local developer? One client saved nearly $20,000 in lost bookings last year because we were able to quickly implement emergency updates during a red tide event that affected their beachfront property. Another avoided a potential ADA lawsuit (increasingly common in Florida) because we proactively addressed accessibility issues on their site.

# Choosing the Right Florida WordPress Developer

If you're a business looking for WordPress expertise in Florida, here's what to consider:

# Look Beyond the Portfolio

Ask potential developers about their experience with Florida-specific challenges. Have they built sites that needed to handle seasonal fluctuations? Do they understand the local competitive landscape?

# Check Local References

Talk to other Florida businesses they've worked with. A developer might have a beautiful portfolio, but do their sites actually perform in our unique market?

# Assess Their Understanding of Your Industry

A developer who has built sites for similar Florida businesses will understand the nuances of your market without a steep learning curve.

# Evaluate Their Crisis Readiness

Ask a surprisingly important question: ""What happens to my website during a hurricane?"" Their answer will tell you a lot about their preparedness mindset.

# WordPress Trends Reshaping Florida's Digital Landscape in 2025

The WordPress ecosystem continues to evolve, and several trends are particularly relevant for Florida businesses:

# Headless WordPress Adoption

I'm seeing increased interest in headless WordPress implementations, especially from larger tourism and real estate clients. This approach‚Äîusing WordPress as a backend while delivering content through a separate frontend system‚Äîoffers significant performance advantages for content-heavy sites common in our market.

# AI-Powered Personalization

With visitors from across the globe, Florida businesses benefit tremendously from personalization. New AI tools for WordPress are enabling sites to automatically adjust content based on a visitor's location, language preference, and even weather conditions at home. Imagine showing snowy weather forecasts to visitors browsing from New York in January alongside your sunny Florida beach photos!

# Voice Search Optimization

As voice search continues to grow, we're implementing specialized WordPress configurations to help Florida businesses capture the ""near me"" searches that drive so much tourist traffic. Questions like ""Hey Siri, find me a seafood restaurant near my hotel"" are gold for local businesses.

# Challenges We Face as Florida WordPress Developers

This isn't all sunshine and palm trees. Florida WordPress developers face unique challenges:

# Educating Clients on Value vs. Cost

With so many budget options available online, explaining why a custom WordPress solution costs more than a DIY website builder can be challenging. I often ask clients: ""Would you rather have a site that looks like everyone else's or one that actually drives business in Florida's competitive market?""

# Seasonal Business Fluctuations

Many Florida businesses experience dramatic seasonal shifts, which affects not just their operations but also our development schedule. We've adapted by offering off-season development discounts and creating flexible support packages.

# Security Concerns

Florida businesses are frequently targeted by cybercriminals due to our high volume of e-commerce and booking transactions. Maintaining robust security while preserving performance requires constant vigilance.

# Disaster Preparedness

Every Florida business needs a digital disaster plan. We've built this into our process, but it adds complexity compared to development in less volatile regions.

# Resources for Florida WordPress Professionals

For those looking to connect with the Florida WordPress community:

# Local Meetups

WordPress meetups in Tampa, Orlando, Miami, and Jacksonville provide excellent networking opportunities. I regularly attend the Tampa Bay WordPress meetup and have found both clients and collaborators there.

# Florida-Specific Training

Several Florida colleges now offer web development programs with WordPress-specific tracks. St. Petersburg College has a particularly good program that includes training on tourism website development.

# Florida Technology Associations

Groups like the Florida Technology Council provide broader industry connections that can be valuable for WordPress professionals looking to expand their network.

# Looking to the Horizon: The Future of WordPress in Florida

As I look toward the future of WordPress development in Florida, I'm excited about several possibilities:

The growing integration between physical and digital experiences will create new opportunities for WordPress developers who understand Florida's tourism economy. Imagine WordPress sites that connect seamlessly with in-person experiences through QR codes, NFC, and location-aware mobile features.

Climate change considerations will increasingly affect website requirements, from real-time weather warnings to sustainable tourism messaging.

The continued population growth in Florida means more businesses need a digital presence, with particular opportunities in the retirement community sector and services for new residents.

# Final Thoughts From the Beach

WordPress development in Florida isn't just a job‚Äîit's an adventure that changes with the tides, the seasons, and the diverse needs of our unique business community. Whether you're a developer looking to make your mark here or a business seeking the right WordPress partner, understanding what makes Florida different is the key to digital success in the Sunshine State.

‚Ä¢Weight Lifting: I‚Äôm a strong girl, my goal this year is to leg press 1,000lbs and maybe read up on power lifting. Right now it‚Äôs strength focused with that one goal of leg press. I‚Äôve found everyone likes stats so:  I squat 400, I can‚Äôt really bench press anymore  due to a shoulder injury (but I try) and my dead lift varies on how much I drank the day before. 

‚Ä¢Coffee/Beer/Wine: More so the experience of consuming these things. Trying new coffee shops on the weekend, beer and corn hole with friends on a Sunday afternoon, a wine bar and tapas for a change of pace in the evening. If someone‚Äôs pouring I‚Äôm drinking. 

‚Ä¢Concerts/Shows/Live Music: I have been to 200+. I have tickets to quite a few already this year and will probably get more. I love music and I love discovering music. You‚Äôll find me at my local record store at least 3x a month. I will take over a TouchTunes at any bar and I will always play RHCP whether it‚Äôs the vibe or not. 

I don‚Äôt like video games or anime. You can have your hobby‚Äôs but these seem to be prevalent in a lot of people as personality traits. So hobby? Fine. Literally the only thing you do on the weekends? Not for me!

Is there a world where I can have a relationship with this person?,"For context, this is someone who I met in Germany in 2023 and instantly fell for. Our universities were both there as part of a collegiate extracurricular. 

We saw each other 6 months later in NYC for the same event and I was able to ask her out on a coffee date over text. It wasn't explicitly a date, but we grabbed coffee and walked central park on a day we were both free. At this point we would both confidently consider each other friends. 

And as far as I could tell, she didn't have any romantic feelings for me. 

A year later, we see each other in NYC again for the same event. Now up until this point we had been periodically keeping in touch over text. She even sent me a picture of herself in Venice, to which I said she looked beautiful. 

But it's a year later and we're back in NYC. I text her to make plans to hangout and I tell her I want to take her to a speakeasy and get drinks, because she's finally able to drink in the states legally. 

It goes really well. We talk about the future, she tells me she got into Oxford and all these UK schools for her masters, I tell her I can't wait to visit her there, etc etc. I walk her back to her hotel and we say our goodbyes because at this point, we are both about to be graduated. And who knows when we'll be in the same city again. We hug and I tell her that I think she's really awesome, and that we'll keep in touch. 

And that's the last I see of her. Now at this point I've been really careful not to be direct in telling her how much I like her romantically. I've made it fairly obvious indirectly however and I wager that she knows I like her in that way.

But because we are separated by such long distance, telling her how I really felt would just make our situation so much worse. Because it's not like I can take her out on dates and we can actually explore the possibility of a relationship.

If our relationship is going to be purely over periodic texts and voice notes, it's better that we just remain friends, right? 

And again, I really really like this girl. But it seems to me that the only way we could actually have a relationship, is if either one of us coincidentally started living in the same 50 mile radius. 

And it just seems like a cruel twist of fate that I'll be confined to MAYBE seeing her once a year, unless like I said, our lives & careers bring us together somehow.

Honestly, it's been going really well. Suspiciously well, but I don't know if it's too early to tell. I've been too scared to try fried foods, and I can live with that. Low fat dairy and coffee have been totally fine, but is it too early to celebrate?

How do I move forward? Is there a world where I can have a relationship with this person?,"For context, this is someone who I met in Germany in 2023 and instantly fell for. Our universities were both there as part of a collegiate extracurricular. 

We saw each other 6 months later in NYC for the same event and I was able to ask her out on a coffee date over text. It wasn't explicitly a date, but we grabbed coffee and walked central park on a day we were both free. At this point we would both confidently consider each other friends. 

And as far as I could tell, she didn't have any romantic feelings for me. 

A year later, we see each other in NYC again for the same event. Now up until this point we had been periodically keeping in touch over text. She even sent me a picture of herself in Venice, to which I said she looked beautiful. 

But it's a year later and we're back in NYC. I text her to make plans to hangout and I tell her I want to take her to a speakeasy and get drinks, because she's finally able to drink in the states legally. 

It goes really well. We talk about the future, she tells me she got into Oxford and all these UK schools for her masters, I tell her I can't wait to visit her there, etc etc. I walk her back to her hotel and we say our goodbyes because at this point, we are both about to be graduated. And who knows when we'll be in the same city again. We hug and I tell her that I think she's really awesome, and that we'll keep in touch. 

And that's the last I see of her. Now at this point I've been really careful not to be direct in telling her how much I like her romantically. I've made it fairly obvious indirectly however and I wager that she knows I like her in that way.

But because we are separated by such long distance, telling her how I really felt would just make our situation so much worse. Because it's not like I can take her out on dates and we can actually explore the possibility of a relationship.

If our relationship is going to be purely over periodic texts and voice notes, it's better that we just remain friends, right? 

And again, I really really like this girl. But it seems to me that the only way we could actually have a relationship, is if either one of us coincidentally started living in the same 50 mile radius. 

And it just seems like a cruel twist of fate that I'll be confined to MAYBE seeing her once a year, unless like I said, our lives & careers bring us together somehow.

None of the other fillings have done this! The other ones that I got in that same session are kinda visible in the photos, and they're a normal colour. The ones that I got on the other side of my mouth two months ago are also completely normal. It's just this one!

Filled out the warranty claim online and heard back quickly asking what software version we were on. Replied back immediately and now awaiting some sort of assistance it reassurance this will be made right.

Here are 7 Ways Ants Impact Agricultural Crops for Better Yields.



Number 1: Soil Conditioning

Ants are like tiny gardeners. They create tunnels as they dig, improving soil aeration and water infiltration, which helps plant roots access moisture and nutrients more easily.



Number 2: Nutrient Distribution

As ants forage, they gather organic matter and break it down, redistributing nutrients back into the soil. This process enriches the soil, promoting healthier plants and better crop yields.



Number 3: Biological Pest Management

Ants naturally control pest populations by preying on harmful insects like aphids. By attracting more ants to your farm, you can reduce the need for chemical pesticides while keeping crops safe from pests.



Number 4: Disease Reduction

Some ant species have antimicrobial properties that can lower the incidence of plant diseases. By fostering an ant-friendly environment, you can improve plant health and reduce crop losses due to diseases.



Number 5: Enhanced Biodiversity

Incorporating ants into your farming system boosts biodiversity, which is key for sustainable agriculture. They help maintain ecological balance by controlling pests and supporting beneficial insect populations.



Number 6: Increased Yield in Shaded Crops

Ants thrive in shaded crop systems, like coffee or cacao farms, where they help minimize damage from pests. The cooler microclimate allows ants to be more effective in their roles, leading to healthier crops and higher yields.



Number 7: Economic Benefits

Utilizing ants for pest control can save you money on pesticides and labor costs. With fewer chemicals needed, not only do you cut expenses, but you also support a healthier environment on your farm.

Really need help with my nervous system,"Some background: I am a 30 y/o F went through a big trauma losing someone close in my final year of university (7 years ago). Had a breakdown 6 months later (nightly panic attacks, major physical anxiety symptoms) and started therapy which helped manage. However, it changed me entirely, I am now very highly strung and my nervous system has never quite regulated itself like it did before. The panic attacks have gone and I can handle daily life much better now however the anxiety has manifested itself very specifically into work related anxiety.

My nervous system fight or flight kicks in during meetings when I know I have to speak or when I am interviewing (anything along those lines- it's the build up and anticipation making it so awful for me) if I am just called upon suddenly I am fine. I am a confident outgoing very social person but I cannot describe the level of severity in the moment it's really bad to the point l've had to walk out of meetings feigning a phone call or personal emergency. It's honestly unbearable for me.

I have done CBT, hypnotherapy, psychotherapy, body work and breath work in the past but have never tackled this specific issue fully or properly.
I have tried cold showers, quit drinking coffee and exercise a lot more now to manage on a smaller scale but no matter how many meetings I sit through the severity persists. I've even left a job because I couldn't handle the amount of meetings we had as it was affecting my mental health so badly even though I was more than capable for the work itself. Would rather not take daily medication as it does not affect me every single day to this extent but open to anything at this point.

Im at a point where I am trying really hard to get on with it but not sure how to tackle this as it's so specific and everything l've tried so far has failed.
It's stopping me from pursuing the career and job that I want and I just really need some practical advice or tips. I am not currently in therapy but open to going back and not on any medication (would like to avoid if possible) and open to going back and have just moved to a new city.

I should also mention it's possible i have ADHD or some form of ADD as pointed out to me by a prior therapist and nurse separately that can contribute to maskina as anxietv incase that is relevant.

I wish there was a website to apply to work for the Mexican cartel. Like I feel that might be my only option in life so I don‚Äôt feel like a depressed slave. Smh. I earn anywhere from 26/hr-35/hr depending on job, and more than 50 hours a week. Why is it so hard to even pay rent?! (Which is only $900/month, but the place is abysmal, like 100sq/ft max) I‚Äôm not eating avocado toast daily for breakfast and make my coffee at home. Idk wtf else to do. I was never good with money, but also never received any sorta guide on how to budget.

Please. Just tell me I‚Äôm right in wanting to just straight up send it. Or recommend a country to move to, or a career you think I can pursue. I‚Äôm in the US, and feel like I am living in Zimbabwe or something..",1,1744598205.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

I have been feeling a bit odd lately. You see, sometimes I feel a odd sense of pleasure when unfortunate things happen to me. I honestly think this stems from the fact that my parents never clearly sympathized with me. Whenever I'd try and share something that would bother me I'd be put down, ridiculed, made fun of, or be told that I'm overreacting. I guess that's why I enjoy situations where it can gain sympathy from others. I don't understand it though. For example, the other day I didn't know my church youth club was going to a coffee shop for bible study so I didn't bring any money. Everyone else did and my youth pastor and his wife were nice and bought me a drink. Even though I was thankful for some reason I wished that they never bought me anything. Also in a way I like to be left out by my friends, like it feels bad but for some reason it feels good.

there‚Äôs a possibility this fic is gone cause it‚Äôs been YEARS but I was going down memory lane and remembered a homestuck fic I wanted to revisit for giggles. I tried searching for it but no dice so I wanted to see if anyone else knew of it.

this was posted originally on deviantart and it had an intro/prologue post and then you could choose a character and read their story. 

so in the intro of the fic, I think it‚Äôs a bunch of the male characters and the plot idea is how they met their significant others. the fic then branches off into each one of their stories. 

I remember there was a john one where the reader was his neighbor. another was a karkat one where the reader works in a coffee shop and I think also a college au. it‚Äôs a modern setting on earth where trolls were still new to earth. that‚Äôs all I can remember :,)

1jyoh4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifieroticabyAD/comments/1jyoh4k/beyond_the_veil/,Beyond the veil,"Welcome to my galexy.  I have always had a big imagination. I am also a horny sob. I will release another portion of my first story each week. I have written out species specific with the assistance of ai. It has help me work out details and keep me true to the world I made.
I find most scifi stories focus on a human male. In beyond the Veil I hopefully brought many genres together. Scifi, erotica, and horror. 









BEYOND THE VEIL

1. THE FIRST CROSSING

Nyx-7 Research Station 
The central control center smelled of ozone and stale coffee. The curved monitors in the stretched floor to ceiling, revealing the inky blackness of space torn by a shimmering golden scar‚Äîthe Veil. It pulsed like a living thing, casting liquid light across the faces of the assembled scientists.
Two distinct groups stood apart
The Terrans wore form-fitting gray uniforms with hexagonal insignias on their shoulders. Their skin ran the gamut from pale ivory to deep umber, their eyes squinting at screens filled with scrolling data. They moved with the clipped efficiency of military personnel, though their fingers trembled slightly as they worked.
The Qhelxians were nightmares of evolutionary elegance‚Äîtall, draconic humanoids with obsidian scales that drank in the light. Their elongated muzzles varied: some bore rows of needle-teeth behind lipless mouths, others had smooth, beak-like jaws. They wore layered armor reminiscent of ancient samurai, the lacquered plates breathing with biotech filaments that pulsed like veins
On the main display screen, the Terran research vessel Eidolon glided toward the anomaly. Its sleek, gunmetal-gray hull bristled with sensor arrays and dish antennae, giving it the appearance of some deep-sea creature evolved to navigate unseen pressures.  
‚ÄúThreshold in thirty seconds,‚Äù announced a Terran woman with close-cropped black hair. Her nametag read Hansen.
One of the reptilian scientists made a chittering noise, its clawed fingers flying across a holographic interface. The Terran beside it‚Äîa young man with dark circles under his eyes‚Äîtranslated: ‚ÄúThe Qhelxian science team is registering minor quantum fluctuations from the Veil‚Äôs surface.‚Äù 
No one breathed.  
Inside the Eidolon
The ship‚Äôs corridors were all sharp angles and pale blue lighting. Warning stripes marked the floors, leading to the reinforced observation blister at the bow. The air smelled of antiseptic and the faint electric tang of overworked machinery.  
Captain Elias Ryland gripped a handrail, his stocky frame blocking the main console. His salt-and-pepper beard twitched as he scowled. ‚ÄúGet her out of here,‚Äù he barked
Two crewmen in gray jumpsuits struggled with a thrashing blue figure. She stood nearly seven feet tall, long black hair, her skin the color of deep ocean water, glowing traces of veins visible beneath its surface. Her face was terran like, with luminous blue eyes that burned with panic.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand!‚Äù The alien‚Äôs voice was melodic but raw with terror. ‚ÄúThey see everything that crosses! They‚Äôll take you!‚Äù  
The blue woman lashed out, her elongated fingers ending in delicate claws. ‚ÄúFools! You think this is exploration? This is trespass!‚Äù 
‚Äúmove, get her out of here!‚Äù he commanded his men 
On the main viewer, the Veil filled the screen. Golden light pulsed through the observation blister, casting everyone‚Äôs shadow in sharp relief against the walls
Contact.
The Eidolon pierced the surface. 
Like a ripple in a magical gold mirror. There was no sound. No shockwave.  
Just silence.
Nyx-7 ‚Äì control center
The monitors erupted in chaos. Information flodding the system. The data dissolved into static.
‚ÄúSensors overloading!‚Äù someone yelled.  Then‚Äî  
-everything went dark.
The station‚Äôs emergency lights flared to life‚Äîstrobing red, casting the observation deck in jagged, hellish flashes. The screens crackled back to life as the Eidolon finished passing into the veil.
Three heart beats later.
The Veil went dark. It rippled as a tendril of smoke, darker than the surrounding blackness, peeled away from the Veil. It moved wrong‚Äînot drifting like gas would in zero-G, but with purpose, with hunger. 
It reached the bioship first‚Äîan organic-looking vessel covered in spiraling silver script that hurt the eyes to focus on. The smoke passed through its hull like water through a sieve.
The bioship convulsed. Its fleshy outer layer blackened, shriveled, then burst outward in a cloud of frozen viscera.  
The shadow kept coming.  

Toward the station. 
Panic set in on all the stations ocupants. Running for the nearest escape pod or transport that would never launch.
‚ÄùGods below‚Äî‚Äú a Qhelxian researcher choked out.   
The shadow swelled.  
Two red eyes ignited in its depths.  
Then‚Äîhands. Long, clawed, forming from the smoke, reaching. 
Impact 
The wraith slammed into Nyx-7. The entire structure shuddered. Metal screamed as four molten gashes tore across the hull.  
Then‚Äî  
The wraith melted, dissolving into the station‚Äôs own shadows. 
The sound hit first.  
A screeching whisper, slithering through the walls. The Qhelxians collapsed, hands clamped over their ears, black blood trickling from their nostrils and eyes. The Terrans ran, some screaming, others frozen in place.  
A shadow swelled on the bulkhead.  
Eyes opened.  
Hands clawed free of the walls shadow, smoke-solidifying into talons.  
The first crewman died mid-scream, his body yanked into the wall.
Others were struck down with scalding claws of rage..
A Qhelxian resercher crouched in a corner, his beak cracked, black blood oozing down his chestplate. His biotech armor was peeling away in ribbons, trying to escape his body. The recording was shaky, the image distorted. His face was half-shadowed, his left eye burst, weeping black fluid.  
‚ÄùThe shadow moves,‚Äù he rasped. ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs in the walls. It‚Äôs alive. It took them. The Eidolon. It took them. It‚Äôs here for us. The blue one...‚Äù  
A noise‚Äîscraping metal.  
His remaining eye flicked to something off-screen.  
‚ÄùThe red eyes‚Äî‚Äú   
Behind him, the bulkhead breathed.
Then, a whisper, barely audible:  
‚ÄùThey‚Äôre in the walls. They don‚Äôt need doors. They don‚Äôt need air. They just‚Ä¶‚Äù  
The feed died.  
Outside the station
Silence
Metal and bio debree floating freely. The station, a glimor of light flickered through its windows. Sparrks pulsing from its wounds. 
The Veil hung placid once more, its golden surface undisturbed.  Not yet at its original brightness.   
Then‚Äî   
With a ripple like disturbed mercury, the Eidolon slid back into normal space. Its running lights flickered weakly. No signs of life. No distress calls sounded.  
Inside, the ship was empty. 
No crew. No bodies.  
Just the quiet hum of reactivating systems.  
‚ÄùAuto-recall initiated,‚Äù the AI intoned. ‚ÄùDestination: Terra. Estimated arrival: Fifteen years.‚Äù  
The engines flared.  
The ship vanished.  
Inside the Eidolon.
A cryopod, its display counting down.  
Inside, glowing blue eyes flickered.

The reviews are kind of vague and not very helpful lol, but I love reading these kinds of posts so maybe some of you will too.
My favourite notes are iris, violet, fig, vanilla, caramel, honey, cherry and cacao, which is why my collection is mostly made up of sweet scents. I am 38/F and have always loved gourmands! 

I've given them all a rating between 1 and 5 -
5 - LOVE it, would repurchase
4 - love it but don't NEED it
3 - like it but am happy to slowly use it up
2 - don't mind it but I'm keen to get it out of my collection so will use up /sell/give away asap
1 - do not like it, sell or donate asap

 This has made me realise that I'm far less picky than what I thought I was haha, although I'm pretty good with only buying scents that I love! I am not a collector in any way though, as I do use all of my perfumes.

**Kayali - Sweet Diamond Pink Pepper**: perfect jammy rose opening, then the drydown is full of saffron and too much oud 

**MAC Turquatic**: basic 'blue' scent, I purchased this while on holidays in the US as it's not available in Australia but unfortunately I find it very boring and basic

**Mugler - Angel**: sweet praline overshadowed by patchouli with a hint of sweaty armpit  

**Sabrina Carpenter - Sweet Tooth Cherry Baby**: cherry candy, almost has a hint of wine in it. Its nice but I have other cherry scents I much prefer 

**Viktor&Rolf - Flowerbomb Ruby Orchid**: sweet, syrupy red scent, it's a mix between OG Flowerbomb and Nectar, yet Ruby Orchid is my least favourite

My entire adult life I had been overweight until just as few years ago. I am now 25 and considered an average weight. The amount of attention I now get it actually unbelievable. I feel sad for my past self, so desperate for any ounce of validation and yet I never got even a second glance, despite my best efforts. 
    
Now, it‚Äôs somehow a daily occurrence that someone compliments my appearance. My daily coffee gets comped by the cashiers at the very least once a week. I was out to get a drink and some food the other day and minded my business, barely even looked around at other people. Go to close out my tab and lo and behold someone I didn‚Äôt even say a word to, had covered the entire thing. 
     
Long story short, it‚Äôs mind boggling how differently you‚Äôre treated and regarded. I understand confidence and styling has some impact but this is just kind of wild to me. It feels like a social experiment in some weird way. Just be ready for some wild social changes to occur if and when you lose a significant amount of weight.

Became friends with this guy through work. Didnt know him super long but we got close, he was getting evicted and already had another place lined up but couldnt move for a few weeks. 

It started out as 3 weeks but then became 4. Whatever no problem. I helped him load and unload his entire one bedroom apartment into our house and up to our guest room. I made it very clear that my partner and I didnt like the idea of roommates bc we are very specific about our routines and the cleanliness of our home and that it was really important that things stayed the way we had them (aka, we dont mind sharing common spaces but keep your stuff clean to the point we dont know that youre living here). He was agreeable and so thankful to the point of tears, we were happy to be able to help him out. 

Well, I had to ask him multiple times to rinse his dishes as we dont want bugs, to put his teabags in the trash when hes done drinking his tea, to put his dishes in the dishwasher if the sign said dirty (he never did but washed his own dishes sometimes), used our small convection oven/airfryer for 40 plus mins at a time to reheat already cooked food on top of the energy his deep freezer took up. He would leave his blunt wrap trash on our coffee table along with his nasty tissues that he would twist into his nose. We gave up the upstairs bathroom because he would blow it up and close the door without a fan (he has stomach issues to add on top of it), his shit stains would be underneath the toilet seat and never cleaned it, would ask us for some of our weed and made us remind him to pay us back for the portions he took acting as if he forgot. He told us he planned on helping with some of our bills after he moved bc he had to save up for the uhaul and moving expenses yet was buying doordash and $30+ meals every other night yet only working 1-2 shifts a week. The room we let him use was disgusting with trash and tissues while he was here. He would sit in our living room w his hand in his pants, he would ask us to change the channel if we were watching something he didnt like OR he would watch Baddies and other loud obnoxious shows on his phone WHILE my partner and I were trying to watch our own thing and yes he did have a pair of headphones to use but never used them.

By the time week 4 was coming around we were READY for him to go. He told me he was gonna get  a uhaul to pack his stuff the night before he was set to move. Well that Friday comes around, he made a comment about not hearing from his leasing office and that he might have to wait til Monday. Partner and I said fuck no. I told him he should contact the office and make sure hes set bc thats what was promised. He said he would email them, I had to tell him to call them on the phone. Sure enough he got in touch and he was still set for Saturday. We go to hangout for the day, I tell him I need to be home by 6 to work on some house stuff. We go, he buys a $35 breakfast, i bought a $10 coffee (maybe even less). Barista puts our orders together, it comes to $45 and hes baffled. He looks at me and asks how much my coffee was üòÇüòÇ I gave my $10 ($6-$8+tip) knowing damn well it wasnt more than that. I take him to a lake park downtown to walk around since he hasnt been around our area much since moving here intially. Hes talking about something, im listening responding. I start talking and get the feeling to stop my sentence short bc hes on his phone and not even paying attention to me. Whatever. I close my eyes and enjoy my ‚Äúalone time‚Äù in the sun. We get ready to leave and this mf has the AUDACITY to bring up his birthday and show me a $62 perfume gift suggestion in case i wanted to get him something AFTER asking me earlier in the week to make him a cake. Im fuming at the entitlement in my head and made a comment ab not having the budget for that bc even Im struggling w bills rn. We get on the way home, I ask him ab his Uhaul plans and he tells me he needs to book one and asks if I wanna take him around 8-9pm. I said uhh no we can go now before we get home as it was about 5:30pm. We got food otw around 6 make it to the one he picks around 6:30, 20 mins goes by i ask if i can leave and he comes out to tell me theyre all booked and have to find a new one. He wants me to look up places hes suggesting, the closest one is 7 mins the alternative is 20. I tell him to book it before we arrive bc im not wasting time. Sure enough theres none available. Its getting to be way later than I wanted to be home so I told him im going home. We park in front of my house and he asks me if we can go to the one 20mins away. I told him im done i need to be home and that this shouldve been planned and paid for already. He goes okay, so do you wanna go around 7-8am?? I said sir‚Ä¶.you need to get an uber, I have helped enough! 

Saturday morning comes, what do you know he was able to get the uhaul and pack it up all by himself. Dipped out after thanking us for 2 secs after i cane downstairs from waking up. After he left we found two broken blinds and our garbage disposal blades werent moving anymore even though they were working perfectly fine before him moving in. He also was supposed to clean the bathroom before he left as we made that clear about his poop stains and surprise surprise he didnt.

1jyo6kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jyo6kc/long_post_advice_welcome_please/,"Long post, advice welcome (please)","This is going to be a long post about breaking up with my kinda-boyfriend so I‚Äôll just jump right into it. 

I (F, 26)met my kinda-boyfriend, let‚Äôs call him J, (M, 43) at a park in July 2023. I was reading alone and he approached me, asked for my number, I agreed and we hit it off straight away: we got talking a lot, found we had many similar interests and were sending multi-paragraph messages back and forth all day. We spoke about our futures too and we both wanted kids, wanted to move away from the city to buy land and ultimately our values lined up. The next time I saw him, he came over to my house and we watched a movie, and that happened a few times, to the point I expressed that I enjoyed his company and would love to be taken out on a date. He agreed, and despite us talking every day (still long messages) and him visiting my house every week or two, we never went on a date. He was always ‚Äòbusy‚Äô, which given his job I of course accepted and was supportive of. My thinking was that it was just a busy time in his life and I can wait for a date. 

Jump forward a few months to around May/June 2024, we were still ‚Äòstuck‚Äô in this same place of long messages, him visiting me and me cooking him lunch or dinner. We spoke about ‚Äòour‚Äô future and having kids and moving. I told him I wanted to move forward and think about kids around 27-28 years old, and he agreed. And I mentioned to him often how I was so excited to go on a date with him (we still hadn‚Äôt been on a date), how I was excited for him to ask me to be his girlfriend (which felt a bit childish but I wanted a clear ‚Äòyes you are my girlfriend‚Äô type commitment from him so I mentioned it). I invited him throughout the year we were talking to my monthly friend catch ups to meet my friends, which he declined saying he was busy when we had plans, and to meet my parents, which he always said ‚ÄòI wanted to but I‚Äôm a bit busy this time‚Äô. 

Even just typing this I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äòwhy did I not see this‚Äô, how he simply wouldn‚Äôt commit. I hadn‚Äôt even seen his house or know his address by this point. I wasn‚Äôt sure he told his family about me, but he would also tell me he struggled with social anxiety and depression, and he was going through a tough busy time at work, and honestly I just wanted to be there to support him and wait until he could give me what I needed. 

In June 2024, I told him I was celebrating my birthday by going camping for 3 days with my friends and family, and he FINALLY agreed to come. I was over the moon, bought a bigger tent and airbed, spare camp chair. Paid for his place camping and organised all of our food to include him. 
Jump to July 2024, 1 week before my birthday and camp trip, he texts me in the middle of the day saying that he wanted to just be friends, when I actually thought this was going to be the weekend (the camp trip) that he would finally ask me to be his girlfriend. I was of course upset, asked him if I could at least call if he didn‚Äôt want to see me in person because that‚Äôs a pretty big thing to drop by text, and he didn‚Äôt, he just texted me. I went quiet that afternoon (I was working from home and had meetings to focus on) and that night he was texting me long paragraphs about how he just needs to focus on himself, he wants to be with me still but just needs to be friends. 
I was thinking.. well shit, this sucks but he wants a future with me. I shouldn‚Äôt wait for him so I‚Äôm not going to, but when he says he‚Äôs ready if I‚Äôm not dating, I would just set firmer boundaries about taking me on dates and committing to me and meeting my family. 

Looking back, I think he did this to get out of the camping trip. 

We still spoke every day, although I was still hurt, mainly because he wanted to end things over text, he seemed like he didn‚Äôt want to lose me and it made me think that he really did want to work on himself to be better to me. After about another month of texting, I told him that I deserve to be loved loudly, the whole experience. Meeting each other‚Äôs families. Dating. And he agreed. And we fell back into what was comfortable, texting every day, seeing each other at my house on weekends. 
I should mention up to this point we haven‚Äôt actually slept together either. Which I used to think was his way of respecting me, but the longer it went on, the more it makes me feel unattractive to him. 

During the last year I think we both got comfortable with this. I stopped asking for him to give me, what in my opinion is the bare minimum (happy for opposing opinions). I stopped asking to meet his family and stopped inviting him to my friends monthly catch ups because he always said no. I‚Äôve still remained supportive of him and trying to be the best ‚Äòpartner‚Äô (I‚Äôm not sure what to call it) to him I can be. 

Something else that‚Äôs important for me to say is that when we first started talking, I had lost a bit of weight and I mentioned once that I would consider implants in the future, after kids. Over the last year he‚Äôs been sending me instagram models posts of women with insanely large implants, for ‚Äòinspiration‚Äô which I usually just like react, because I thought it was weird but whatever. And he asked me a few months ago if he sent too many ‚Äòboob‚Äô photos on instagram, to which I replied ‚ÄòI do get jealous that you‚Äôre looking at other women online‚Äô. And his response was ‚ÄòI‚Äôm just giving you inspiration, if you looked like that I wouldn‚Äôt be looking online‚Äù. Which I KNOW.. I know what you‚Äôre thinking. Why the f would I accept that. I honestly justified it by thinking ‚Äòoh he doesn‚Äôt mean it like that, he just wants to support me‚Äô ‚Ä¶ 

Another thing that I feel is important, is that he always says ‚Äòit‚Äôs hard to find women who want to have kids now‚Äô or ‚Äòit‚Äôs hard to find women who want to move out to the country and away from the city‚Äô. And previously I thought that was just him expressing past experiences, but now I feel like he‚Äôs just keeping me around in case he doesn‚Äôt find anything better. 

Throughout the whole time we‚Äôve been ‚Äòtalking‚Äô, two years, I‚Äôve been honest with what I want, dates, him to commit to me, to meet my friend and family. And he always just says he‚Äôs sorry he‚Äôs so busy and ‚Äòwhy is my life so busy‚Äô but keeps telling me he wants kids and wants the same with me etc. which is why I think I‚Äôve stayed so long. 

I thought maybe it was me, and I asked him one time when he visited if I could be supporting him better (I was always supportive of him, always telling him I‚Äôm proud of him, listening to him complain about things in his life and telling him I‚Äôm always here for him etc) or if there was any needs of his I‚Äôm not meeting. And he said no, I was ‚Äòperfect‚Äô. I know relationships are two sided and I have really tried to take a look at myself and how I can be better in this ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô. 

Anywho, after a few weeks of being fed up with being strung along for almost two years, I decided I was going to end things with him. Which absolutely sucks because I am so in love with him and I don‚Äôt want to hurt myself or him. But I also realise that my future husband wouldn‚Äôt wait two years to commit to me or take me out on a date. 
He came over this weekend and I think he had a sense that I was going to end things, and he was extra attentive. Telling me he wants to plan a date suggestion (I tried to give him suggestions so he could use them for a date idea, things like the aquarium, a coffee date, picnic or reading at the beach etc) that I gave him after Easter, talking about what he wants to get me for my birthday in July, talking about ‚Äòour‚Äô kids etc. and when we sat down at my table I was just about to talk to him about it and he started talking about how he had a rough childhood and he thinks that‚Äôs why he has a hard time in romantic relationships, and he started crying. Which absolutely broke my heart so I of course couldn‚Äôt end things. 

I guess I just want to know if anyone has been in a similar situation. If I‚Äôm doing the right thing not waiting for him any longer. And‚Ä¶ how do I end things? The thought of hurting him feels like a sucker punch to the gut, I just‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm lost and I have nobody to talk to. Any advice would be appreciated.
