Hi everyone! I wanted to share my 20 day updated on microdosing tirzepatide for anyone interested in getting started. 

Start date 1/2/2025 - 35 F 5’7” SW: 204.4 CW:194.4 GW: 155. 

Three days before starting I made sure to up my protein to 120-150g of protein per day and started taking b12, vitamin D, multi vitamin, and started drinking electrolytes.  

I started with a tiny dose of .25mg just to see what it was like injecting myself with a needle and to see how my body would feel. Even with the tiny dose I could feel my stomach had a heavy sensation. This went aways after the first 24 hours. I have been spacing out my injections every 4 days. I then went to .5mg and am now on 1mg and will stay at this amount for the next 4 weeks before I decide if I should increase to 1.25mg. 

What I’ve noticed so far- 
I’m down 10lbs, less inflammation, easily able to say no to sweets, stopped drinking coffee, stopped biting my nails, easily able to focus on projects without constantly being distracted, no interest in drinking alcohol, my body is happy with high protein, fiber, and water.  

Negative effects- 
Slight constipation the first week but it went away after. Made sure to increase magnesium, fiber, and water as I increase protein. 

Diet- 
I’ve been eating mostly steak, ground beef, eggs, chicken, fish, squash, avocados, yogurt, Parmesan cheese, and blueberries. Sometimes I supplement with a protein shake or clear lemonade protein. 

Exercise- 
I walk 3 miles a day with a weighted vest to improve my skeletal muscle and lift weight 3 days per week. 

I have done all of these things before and have never lost 10lbs in 20 days. Can’t wait to see what my 3 month progress will be!

What does this actually mean?","I (21F) recently had a short but meaningful relationship with a guy I met over the summer (22M), and talked into the fall and then got together. We started off great—amazing dates, meeting his friends, and it seemed like we were really into each other. But things moved quickly, and just as I thought we were on the same page, he started to grow distant. He eventually asked me to meet for coffee to “talk,” and during this conversation, he told me he couldn’t live up to my “standards.” He said I’m very goal-oriented, I want marriage and kids one day, and he doesn’t think he’s good enough for me romantically. He also mentioned he’s self-destructive and can’t do long-distance since I go to school out of state. He wanted to end things but said he still wants to be friends and stay in touch. We left on good terms, hugged a lot, and even cried a bit in the parking lot. He kissed my hand and said we should hang out when I’m home for spring break or summer. After that, we continued communicating—snapping back and forth, him updating me on his night shifts, and even joking about the next time we’ll see each other. But his communication isn't always consistent - he sometimes leaves me on open for a day or until I snap him to keep the streak going. He still views and interacts with my stories and occasionally calls me flirty pet names but it’s obvious the dynamic will never be the same. I’ve been back at school for about a week now, and I can’t stop wondering: why do men push away someone who genuinely cares about them? I’ve never pressured him for anything, and I’ve been supportive and understanding, but it feels like he’s holding himself back.

I know he’s dealing with his own issues and fears about commitment or not being “good enough,” but is there really nothing I could’ve done differently? I don’t want to be the one who has to fix him, but it’s hard not to feel like I was too much of a “good girl” for him.

We talked pretty casually as coworkers. She would often come to me about worries about what others think of her in the workplace and I thought nothing of it. Sadly she was laid off a few months ago. She was really close friends with another coworkers of ours who is also a mutual friend though, so us 3 and a mutual guy friend of ours (also a coworker) have been hanging out every week.

We first hung out at her close friend’s 21st birthday party which was a small gathering at a bar. The close friend’s in question was tired and wanted to leave early, so the girl in question went to drive her home but asked if I wanted to catch up more tonight since we hadn’t seen each other since she was laid off. The other guy went home early that night. That night we mainly just caught up and I thought nothing of it. We stayed another 2-3 hours just catching up. We started hanging weekly as a group after this. 

More recently (within the past 2 weeks) she has been texting me more individually. Mainly just a lot of “I’m bored” or “how’s your day been texts”. Which I still didn’t think much of because we’ve been hanging out more and she’s fun to talk to. This has usually been a daily thing.

A few days ago she asked our group if we could all hang out on Monday. I thought this was a bit weird since the previous day we had discussed it but found that the other two in our group weren’t available till Saturday. Still in case she forgot I just said I’m free, and then she texted me privately to ask what I wanted to do. She suggested coffee or playing some games at her apartment lobby. I said those sound good and made a remark about how my apartment doesn’t have anything besides the video games in my room. She then pivoted to hanging out at my place because video games sound fun (even though she’s never been a gamer). 

My room in my apartment isn’t very large so rather than having a chair to sit in to play games I usually do it on a bed. When we arrived she initially sat on the floor leaning against the bed, but moved up to me on the bed shortly after we started playing. She then got comfortable getting under the covers like I was with me, and started making jokes about how she was so comfortable that she was going to fall asleep. I just laughed it off, but she made this joke a few times more times. We played together for a few hours till it got late and I dropped her back off at home. 

She’s come over now every night DMing me if I was free to game in my apartment again and it’s been the same situation. She’s said she’s really starting to enjoy the games now and is excited to keep playing. I haven’t mentioned us hanging out one on one to either of our mutual friends, and neither has she as far as I’m aware. We still text daily, and it’s usually just about what we’re doing, stuff we like etc. She still confides in me about being nervous with her new coworkers or if some of her friends (who I haven’t met) are talking shit behind her back etc.

So my main question is, is she viewing me now more as a very close friend, or is she making subtle flirts. After spending more time with her I am interested, but I’m worried how it would affect our friend group dynamic regardless of the answer. I’ve also been told in the past by my exes that I’m horrible at reading hints from girls so any insight would be appreciated. 

TLDR:
An old coworker of mine and I have started seeing each other more. Started with group activities with mutual friends and have started doing more one on one activities. She texts me daily, and isn’t afraid of being vulnerable with me about her insecurities. Is she developing feelings for me or is she considering me a close friend?

I'e owned a few Silvias and modded my previous machine with an Auber PID, pressure gauge, dimmer mod, etc.  It made great espresso.  I bought this machine cheaply off of craigslist and rebuilt it from a complete disassembly, incorporating the Ito / Leva! kit from Software and Circuits along the way.  It's been a wonderful upgrade.  The video shows a medium roast coffee with a custom ""lever"" style profile.. the Ito recognizes the cup weight (via BT module connected to scale) and runs a pre-programmed gravimetric dose of 38g (the actual weight out was 37.7g).  The pressure profile pre-infuses at 2.5bar for 10s and then ramps quickly to 9bar for 5s, after that 20s of linear decreasing pressure until it hits 4bars or the shot finishes (whichever comes first).  This shot ran a tiny bit slow for my preference, but still tasted amazing.

I went all in, though I did ween off sugary treats for like month, though binged a bit over the holidays. Zero issues really. Started with 2-3 meals a day, but as I go along, I am just not hungry. I am down to OMD pretty much.

I eat beef, eggs, lard, little bit of cheese or full fat greek yogurt. Also fish, including sashimi. No cheating, except coffee with a drop heavy cream, occasional latte. Also a bit of soy sauce/wasabi with sashimi. But nothing else.

Can't say I observed huge changes yet, but I already lost 5 kgs, which maybe is water.  No bloat, way less farting.  But not being hungry is new feeling. I don't have health issues, except pretty severe tinnitus that I hope to reduce (it is already bit more managable). Also mild sleep apnea, that I hope may go away when I lose weight.

Eat whole, fresh, unprocessed, natural foods in 40-40-20 ratio. Anything that would exist in the Garden of Eden. If you question whether or not you can eat it in good conscience, ask yourself, “does this exist in the Garden of Eden?” If so, you may eat it : )
2. Eat only foods that will spoil, but eat them before they do.
3. Try to eat locally and in season.
4. Avoid white carb things (sugars and starches)
5. Avoid High Fructose Corn Syrup like the plague.
6. Avoid packaged foods (they usually contain trans fats, hydrogenated fats, artificial colors, preservatives; if they don’t they should be OK).
7. Eat naturally-raised proteins including wild-caught fish, seafood, poultry, beef, lamb, game, organ meats, and eggs (unless you are allergic to them).
It is probably best to avoid dairy products because of additives, hormones and antibiotics. They are also associated with allergies and excess mucus productions, but if you cannot avoid them, then eat whole, naturally-produced milk products, preferably raw milk and butter or fermented products such as whole yogurt, whole cheeses, and raw sour cream.
8. Use only traditional fats and oils including grass-fed butter and other animal fats, extra virgin olive oil, expeller expressed sesame and flax and the tropical oils – coconut and palm. Do not overheat them in cooking as this can convert them to trans fats. NO trans/hydrogenated fats (our body doesn’t recognize them!)
9. Eat fresh fruits and vegetables, preferably organic, in salads and soups or lightly steamed with raw butter (or the best butter you can find). Vegetables:Fruits = 2:1. Eat fruits as they come, by themselves if possible, and before noon preferably.
It is best to avoid most grains (GMO, grains sitting too long in the silos etc.) as it is very difficult to obtain true whole grains. Most are processed. Many nuts are old, rancid, over-roasted and may have a fungus that produces aflatoxin. If you can find them use fresh, whole grains and nuts that have been prepared by soaking, sprouting, or sour leavening to begin to neutralize phytic acid and other anti-nutrients.
10. Prepare homemade meat stocks from the bones of naturally raised chicken, beef, lamb, or fish and use liberally in soups and sauces.
11. Use herbal teas and coffee (in moderation. Use only organically grown beans, and grind them yourself.
12. Use spring water or filtered water for cooking and drinking. Reverse osmosis water is OK but doesn’t have many minerals.
13. Use unrefined sea salt and a variety of organic herbs and spices for food interest and appetite stimulation.
14. Make your own salad dressing using raw vinegar and extra virgin olive oil.
If you must use a sweetener, natural sweeteners such as raw Honey, maple syrup, Xylitol, and the herb stevia are recommended. Although these are more natural they are still simple carbohydrates and still have a profound effect on your blood sugar.
15. Cook only in glass (preferably), good quality enamelware or stainless steel.
16. Use only natural whole food supplements.
17. Do these things 90-10 (90% of the time follow the guidelines, 10% of the time give yourself a break – you live in the real world).
18.Get plenty of sleep, exercise, natural light, and minimize stress.

Because I've seen her account interact with my family members on that side and my dad and I routinely communicate on Facebook.

1. How bad is the legal fallout if this gets discovered ? I know perjury can be serious but how likely is this to get him in any trouble?

2. Can this affect her immigration status if it is found out to be perjury?

Hi everybody! Sorry for the grammar mistakes, english is not my first language.

I (25 F) grew up with a very strict mother food-wise. Everything related to food was strictly checked and controlled. I couldn’t eat nor drink what I wanted when I wanted with almost everytime a reflexion like « It’s either one biscuit, or nothing » or « No! It’ll go directly onto your thighs », that kind of thing. She was still ok to eat junk food sometimes but she still controlled everything I was ordering, from the meal to the drink to if I order a dessert or not. Due to that, we never had candies or snacks to be eaten whenever at home, it was very exceptional, and only for my parents, so that they could have a biscuit with their coffee after lunch. So, to make sure nobody was eating their snacks, she counted every single biscuit in each packet, and told me, and only me, not my brother, how many was left, and if I took one, I would get in trouble. She would also use the « if you don’t finish your dish, you won’t leave the table » strategy to force me to eat something I deeply felt disgust for, when I was still a child (up to my 12).

For context, she grew up herself with an almond mom, who controls EVERYTHING, even more than her now. She (my grand-mother) only believes in plain white fish with boiled veggies with no seasoning and no dinner diet. She also used the same strategies as my mother uses on me, so I know she is only repeating stuff she bore as a child, but that’s not an excuse, I would NEVER make my daughter bear the same things I had to bear if I have one one day. 

Due to that, I started to fantasize food up to an obsession, every cake I could not eat, every soda I could not drink, became rapidly obsessive in my mind, until it created an eating disorder in me. For the past 10 years, I’ve struggled with it, alternating between binge eating and not eating at all. I only started to realize what was happening to me 3y ago and started a therapy 1y and a half ago. 

My therapist encouraged me to discuss this with my mom to help soothe the situation between us, but everytime I talk to her about it,  to try to make her understand what her words are doing to me, she twists it to make me feel guilty about blaming her : « Oh, waw, so I am a monster, I am the worst mom ever, I am the bad guy here, huh? ». But that day was the last straw. 

For another piece of context, I had to go back living with my parents, for numerous reasons, but mostly financial. We were just arriving from a looooong trip by car from our first to our second home, closest to where the rest of my family lives, to celebrate my birthday. There was nothing in the fridge, no supermarket opened, a pizzeria down the block and I was STARVING. So I suggested that we ate pizza for dinner. Both my parents agreed, but my mom still wanted to control : « We share one pizza for us three, or we eat nothing ». I told her that I wanted one pizza for myself, that i could buy it myself but she still wanted to control my eating.

The conversation went louder, when I told her that she doesn’t have to control everything I am eating, that if I want to eat a f-ing pizza, I will be eating a whole f-ing pizza, to which she replied « Do I need to speak harsh to you? Cause I visibly didn’t do it enough » 

My father did not say a thing. He never said a thing actually, whether to me towards my eating, which is good, nor to her for her behaviour towards me, which is cancelling the rest, since he accepts what she is doing. 

So, instead of becoming violent, though I was raging to be, I told her, very calmly : « Why do you think I see a therapist? It’s because of you, and all the sh-tty stuff you’ve been doing to me my whole life ». To which she replied, again with her baby crying victim show. I got back to my room and did not came back downstairs until the next morning (11:59 because we had to go and see the almond grandma). 

When we arrived, I had the surprise to see the whole family, turning their faces towards me, and I swear, if eyes could kill, I would have been atomized. Long story short, almost everybody was on my mom’s side, told me that I was an ungratedful b!tch, that my mom was torring herself apart to make me a great birthday party and that’s how i was thanking her. Hopefully, one of my aunts, my brother and sister-in-law were on my side and conforted me, but to the rest of my family, I am the a-hole. So, AITA? ",1,1737575822.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I'm pretty familiar with vodka, and I think it's easy to be. Vodka has a very minimal flavour profile, and not many variables to tweak with during the production process compared to other spirits (no aging, botanical distilling, etc.). It's easy to tell a good/bad vodka, and I find it easy to compare vodkas that use different starch sources. 

Anyways, looking into rum it seems to be the opposite; column still vs pot still, aging time/material, molasses/sugar ratio, terrior (more important for agricole?), and it seems to not be uncommon to add sugar or even colour after the fact. 

All that to say I'm interested in the tasting notes of rum that lend themselves to nutty or chocolaty cocktails. (more molasses and pot stilled?)

Hi everybody! Sorry for the grammar mistakes, english is not my first language.

I (25 F) grew up with a very strict mother food-wise. Everything related to food was strictly checked and controlled. I couldn’t eat nor drink what I wanted when I wanted with almost everytime a reflexion like « It’s either one biscuit, or nothing » or « No! It’ll go directly onto your thighs », that kind of thing. She was still ok to eat junk food sometimes but she still controlled everything I was ordering, from the meal to the drink to if I order a dessert or not. Due to that, we never had candies or snacks to be eaten whenever at home, it was very exceptional, and only for my parents, so that they could have a biscuit with their coffee after lunch. So, to make sure nobody was eating their snacks, she counted every single biscuit in each packet, and told me, and only me, not my brother, how many was left, and if I took one, I would get in trouble. She would also use the « if you don’t finish your dish, you won’t leave the table » strategy to force me to eat something I deeply felt disgust for, when I was still a child (up to my 12).

For context, she grew up herself with an almond mom, who controls EVERYTHING, even more than her now. She (my grand-mother) only believes in plain white fish with boiled veggies with no seasoning and no dinner diet. She also used the same strategies as my mother uses on me, so I know she is only repeating stuff she bore as a child, but that’s not an excuse, I would NEVER make my daughter bear the same things I had to bear if I have one one day. 

Due to that, I started to fantasize food up to an obsession, every cake I could not eat, every soda I could not drink, became rapidly obsessive in my mind, until it created an eating disorder in me. For the past 10 years, I’ve struggled with it, alternating between binge eating and not eating at all. I only started to realize what was happening to me 3y ago and started a therapy 1y and a half ago. 

My therapist encouraged me to discuss this with my mom to help soothe the situation between us, but everytime I talk to her about it,  to try to make her understand what her words are doing to me, she twists it to make me feel guilty about blaming her : « Oh, waw, so I am a monster, I am the worst mom ever, I am the bad guy here, huh? ». But that day was the last straw. 

For another piece of context, I had to go back living with my parents, for numerous reasons, but mostly financial. We were just arriving from a looooong trip by car from our first to our second home, closest to where the rest of my family lives, to celebrate my birthday. There was nothing in the fridge, no supermarket opened, a pizzeria down the block and I was STARVING. So I suggested that we ate pizza for dinner. Both my parents agreed, but my mom still wanted to control : « We share one pizza for us three, or we eat nothing ». I told her that I wanted one pizza for myself, that i could buy it myself but she still wanted to control my eating.

The conversation went louder, when I told her that she doesn’t have to control everything I am eating, that if I want to eat a f-ing pizza, I will be eating a whole f-ing pizza, to which she replied « Do I need to speak harsh to you? Cause I visibly didn’t do it enough » 

My father did not say a thing. He never said a thing actually, whether to me towards my eating, which is good, nor to her for her behaviour towards me, which is cancelling the rest, since he accepts what she is doing. 

So, instead of becoming violent, though I was raging to be, I told her, very calmly : « Why do you think I see a therapist? It’s because of you, and all the sh-tty stuff you’ve been doing to me my whole life ». To which she replied, again with her baby crying victim show. I got back to my room and did not came back downstairs until the next morning (11:59 because we had to go and see the almond grandma). 

When we arrived, I had the surprise to see the whole family, turning their faces towards me, and I swear, if eyes could kill, I would have been atomized. Long story short, almost everybody was on my mom’s side, told me that I was an ungratedful b!tch, that my mom was torring herself apart to make me a great birthday party and that’s how i was thanking her. Hopefully, one of my aunts, my brother and sister-in-law were on my side and conforted me, but to the rest of my family, I am the a-hole. So, AITA? ",2,1737575476.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

I met a guy on an app about 3 weeks ago. Our first date was ok, but seemed to have some nerves and awkwardness as a lot of first dates do (our first date was a workout at the gym followed by coffee). He followed up the next morning saying that he enjoyed meeting me, and referenced something we discussed. The next day, he set up another date for a couple of days later. The second date was great and I felt chemistry with him (another gym date). A couple of days later, he asked what I’m looking for in a guy, and shared his thoughts and that he’s looking for something long term and that while he’s in no rush, he would like to be married again. 

Third date, we had dinner at a nice restaurant, then went to his place and had sex. Fourth date at my place for a movie, then had takeout (this was Sunday). 

He will text a little bit between dates (couple of texts here and there, only goes one day without checking in but mostly daily) and will chat every so often. He’s going on a trip early tomorrow and didn’t ask to see me before so I just threw out there that he’d love to see me but he has a lot to do and someone going on the trip with him will be at his house shortly. He said he wants to do something when he returns. 

He’s very consistent, but not over the top. He seems interested in learning about me and my kids, and isn’t so focused on my career (which a lot of guys seem to do bc I have an interesting job). I have a nice time with him and enjoy his company. 

Despite all this, I get all in my head. I make myself anxious thinking he doesn’t like me bc he doesn’t love bomb. Yesterday he didn’t text all day (I know he’s super busy getting ready for his trip) and I start to convince myself that he’s probably going to ghost me, and he only wanted sex. I was in a VERY toxic 14 year marriage with an alcoholic who I met when I was 22 (he was 32). The beginning was full of excitement, and obsession on both sides. 
 
I don’t feel over the top excitement thinking about him, just feelings of “I like him so far, and I’d like to keep getting to know him and spend more time with him.”

I’m starting to forget all the details, all the places we went to, and all the little glimpses and all the things that made my heart leap for a long while. To be honest though, as much as I want to hate and regret everything that happened; I can’t. Because all the things I’ll remember, at least for now; is the fact that I’m at my happiest when I’m with you.

I wrote something similar to this a few years ago; a different circumstance, a different girl, a different time. And as discombobulated my thoughts are then, they’re even more disorganized right now. All I want to do right now is remember every movie we went to, every meal we shared, and every long walk we took from one place to another. Every moment we spent, talking, and not talking to each other in coffee shops and parks. I want to remember everything before every piece of it turns to ash and dust. I want to remember because I’m bravely trying to forget. There was a time that I thought that I have forgotten and that I have moved on to other things. I did manage to go on and do other things in other aspects of my life, but everything with regards to how I feel about you has become a blur; a mess even.

Every step I had taken since then was a combination of missteps, stumbles, and falls as I tried to run farther and farther from what I felt about you. In hindsight, I never really ran in a straight line. I was running in circles, trying to move on with an underlying current of regret and sadness lurking underneath. I knew all along that I never had a place in that heart. To be fair, I do have a place; just not the spot I wanted to be in. I knew that you loved me back; as a friend. I knew that you were genuinely concerned and cared; the same as with all your friends. And I don’t mean that as a knack because you were one of the most caring friends I ever had. It was my fault that I always fall, and fell hard I did; with people at the most unexpected of times.

And so here we are. I never wanted to say goodbye but here I am, penning a goodbye letter addressed to no one. I’m not even sure if you’ll read this or if you’ll ever see that this post somewhat exists. All I want to say right now is that I’m happy that you are happy and that you being happy is perhaps the most important thing I could know right now. I also want to say thank you for everything but in the end; I have to go now. And to be honest, I think that this is immaterial now. You won’t even probably notice that I’m not there anymore. But that isn’t your fault; all that should be placed squarely on my shoulders.

We sometimes choose to love the person that will never love us the same way back. I did. The choice is mine alone. I’m not even sure why I’m writing this now when I should have written these words several months prior. But alas, the thought of you remains. Bits and pieces of everything I felt before but powerful nonetheless. And so I bid farewell; at least for now. I hope that when the time comes and life made us meet again; you are happy and I’m as happy as you and that we’ll look back at all our moments together with a thankful smile. Keep smiling, continue reaching your dreams, and most important of all, stay happy. You deserve to be happy and don’t let anyone think otherwise. I love you, and you know that you’ll always be one of my fondest memories.

Que sera sera, until we meet again.

In a typical workday at SC/SCDP, we see our main characters begin the day with coffee, and then routinely sip hard liquor (usually whiskey) throughout the morning. Folks like Don, Roger, and the account executives would typically take lunch with clients, which would inevitably involve some combination of liquor or cocktails. Then the casual alcohol drinking (possibly mixed with more coffee) would continue through the afternoon, until the characters left work and either had liquor with dinner at home or went out to dinner/bars in the city for salty food coupled more liquor, wine, or beer. All the while, most of the main characters are smoking cigarettes almost constantly throughout the day. 

Yet despite all this conspicuous alcohol and tobacco consumption, we rarely ever see characters take a drink of water. I imagine there are sinks in the office kitchen, but you never actually see any of the male executives in the kitchen, at a sink, or ever filling any kind of water cup or bottle. 

How did these people stay adequately hydrated?! I’d imagine that all of them had dry mouths, cracked hands, headaches, and fatigue. Perhaps I’m so used to the modern office environment where nearly everyone has a massive refillable water bottle on them at all times and there are filling stations and vending machines everywhere. Yet the very presence of readily available water and water drinking seems almost entirely absent from the 1950s/60s office environment depicted in the show.

The best part? Messages from people who've made our facial massager part of their daily ritual. Whether through a friend's recommendation or as a gift, each story reminds me why we started. If you're curious about what we're building, our virtual door is always open.

Picture this: It's 2015, I'm sitting in a tiny café in Antalya, Turkey, surrounded by the smell of Turkish coffee and sea breeze, thinking ""Hey, I should start a travel blog!"" Fast forward 30 minutes, and I somehow managed to set my entire website to Turkish. Couldn't read a single word, including the ""change language"" button. 😅

But you know what? After years of fumbling around (and eventually figuring things out), I want to share everything I wish someone had told me when I started. Because let's be real - most ""how to start a blog"" guides sound like they were written by robots who've never actually traveled.

**The Complete ""Learn From My Mistakes"" Guide:**

**Picking Your Platform**

After trying literally everything (seriously, I even attempted to build a blog on Blogger... don't ask), I can tell you [WordPress.org](http://WordPress.org) is the way to go. Yes, it's a bit more complicated than those drag-and-drop platforms, but trust me - you'll thank yourself later.

Funny story: I started on a free platform and had to migrate everything when they suddenly decided to ban affiliate links. Try explaining to your mom why your blog disappeared for three days during the move! 🤦‍♀️

**The Hosting Drama**

Remember that scene in Finding Nemo where Dory just keeps swimming? That was me, trying different hosting providers until I found one that didn't crash every time more than 10 people read my blog simultaneously. Hostinger finally saved my sanity - they're like that reliable friend who answers your panic texts at 3 AM.

**Theme Adventures**

My first blog design looked like a unicorn threw up on a 90s website. I used SEVEN different fonts on one page because I couldn't decide which one I liked best. My friend took one look and asked if my blog was having an identity crisis. Now I use Blossom Travel Pro, and it actually looks professional!

**The Content Journey**

Want to hear something embarrassing? My first blog post was titled ""Turkey Is Nice."" That's it. That was the whole vibe. No details about the ancient ruins, nothing about the food that made me cry tears of joy, just... ""Turkey Is Nice.""

Now I know better. The posts that really connect are the ones where I share the real stuff:

* Getting lost in Cappadocia and ending up being adopted by a local family for dinner
* The day I wore new shoes to explore Athens (spoiler: the band-aids I packed saved my life)

**Plugins That Saved My Life**

After uploading a 15MB photo that nearly killed my site (RIP first blog), I discovered these lifesavers:

* Smush for making photos actually load before the next century
* WP Super Cache because waiting for pages to load is so boring
* Social Warfare because my DIY social share buttons once mysteriously played music when clicked (still don't know how that happened)

**Making Money (Eventually)**

My first affiliate sale was $1.23 from a travel adapter I recommended. I celebrated like I'd won the lottery! Now I know the secret isn't having millions of readers - it's having the right readers who trust you because you're real with them.

**The Reality Check**

Some days you'll stare at your screen wondering if anyone (besides your mom) is reading. Other days you'll accidentally delete an entire post right before publishing (yes, I did that!). But then you'll get that comment from someone saying your post helped them navigate Istanbul like a pro, and suddenly it's all worth it.

**Pro Tips From Someone Who Learned the Hard Way:**

1. Back up your site (learned this after accidentally deleting my entire homepage)
2. Don't try to sound like other travel bloggers (your weird stories are your superpower)
3. Take photos of EVERYTHING (even the disasters - they make the best stories)
4. Make friends with other bloggers (they'll understand why you're taking 47 photos of your coffee)

For my fellow introverts - yes, you can absolutely do this! Some of the best travel stories come from those of us who prefer to observe quietly and notice the details others miss.

I've been playing around with dates and the implied idea about babies through some of RK and RC's tweets. I saw someone's reply on twitter about Naegele's Rule on how to calculate a baby's due date. With the January 28 four year anniversary coming up of when they shut off the buy button and GME's peak, I feel that this special day still holds a significant memory in this whole saga.  
  
Keep in mind the definition of Naegele's Rule:

A typical pregnancy lasts, on average, 280 days, or 40 weeks—starting with the first day of the last normal menstrual period as day 1. An estimated due date can be calculated by following steps 1 through 3.

1. First, determine the first day of your last menstrual period.
2. Next, count back 3 calendar months from that date.
3. Lastly, add 1 year and 7 days to that date.

I took a look at RK's Time Magazine and the iconic figure 4:20 stood out in red. So if you do the math from April 20, 2024. Subtract 3 months would put us at January 20, 2024. Then you add 1 year and 7 days and it would land us at Monday, January 27, 2025.  
  
But if you add an average of 280 days or (40 weeks), that would land us at Saturday, January 25, 2025.

This being a weekend and the following Monday could possibly play a meaningful role. Usually mergers and acquisition takes place over the weekend so that they can announce it the following Monday. Could we possibly have an M&A coming soon? I definitely would NOT put all my eggs in one basket on this speculation. We have less than a week to find out to confirm if this idea has any meaning. I would need definitive confirmation next Monday to know for sure.

In addition to this speculation, RK had a children's book with a clock that was heading towards 2 o'clock on the short hand and the long hand is heading towards the 60 minute mark from the 50 minute mark. If the hours equals a month each and there's 12 hours on the clock. Then could 2 o'clock represents February? If there are 10 minutes left of 1 o'clock, that range would represent 25.83 - 31 days (January has 31 days). If we break it down even further, the 0.83 would equal to 1200 minutes out of 1,440 (24 hours x 60 minutes). That would put the ""seconds"" equal to 8pm. If we ignore PM, then it would just be calculated from 720 minutes and we will calculate out 600 minutes or 10am. Teddy's Publishing is trademarked in Delaware, so we can guess that it might be on EST time zone.

From August 1, 2024, when RC posted the coffee tweet (hinted at 5 shots pregame/Ocean's 12/RK live stream) to January 27, 2025 is 122 trading days. Probably not intentional since nobody expected January 9 will be Jimmy Carter's memorial day, but it's fun to think that 122th meme of the Times Cover magazine lands on that day. But Dave Chapelle's Rick James meme number 124 lands on 1/29/25, the day after the 4 year anniversary of the buy button shut off. Also, could just be a coincidence.

I can't find where it is but somewhere in the subreddit someone posted a finding of predicting when RK's next tweet is based on the time magazine

No, I didn't smoke any good stuff for this tin, but there's too many coincidences. What's the odds of this tin being completely wrong like any other tin and dates? The answer, closer to 100%. So I'm not getting my hopes up until it happens.",3,1737574783.0,Superstonk,3,0.57,False

1i7js8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1i7js8p/i_am_proud_of_us_and_our_wisdom/,I am proud of us and our wisdom.,"I'm very proud of my partner and myself for resolving a problem wisely, maturely and without offending each other. We understand that there are responsible parties, but not guilty ones.

We both spent the weekend on an incredible trip to the north of our country, in the desert. It was a trip that was planned to be perfect, we put the phones away, chose excellent restaurants and hotels, as well as good tours. It really was something that took a lot of effort. I mention this because this circumstance helped us get it into our heads that we didn't want to spoil this moment for absolutely any reason.

My partner has a habit of taking her wedding ring off to sleep and bathe. On Saturday, I saw his wedding ring on the bathroom sink, as usual. But while we were in the van on a tour, she showed me her finger and joked that she was single. The ring wasn't there and she couldn't remember whether she'd put it on or not. I couldn't remember either, but we assumed it was in the bathroom. We enjoyed a beautiful morning in the desert and returned to the hotel, where we realised that the ring wasn't in the bathroom. We searched our room for the ring and couldn't find it. We really did check every corner, every rucksack, every pocket and nothing.

When we realised that the ring was really lost, she started crying and I got really angry, although I didn't say anything. And then, together, we realised:

1. We don't travel so much to spoil our joys with one bad moment;
2. Although I was upset, what exactly was I going to gain by exposing it excessively? I kept it short, said I was upset, without shout, but that we'd manage. And that was that. She was suffering, she already knew the responsibility in this circumstance. What exactly was I going to gain by being incisive? Would I ""punish her"" and earn her anger? My marriage is worth more than my wife hating me. Also, it could also have happened because of something I did. What if it had been me? What if I had lost? Would I feel comfortable with my wife slaughtering me? No.
3. This ring is from our civil marriage. We're still getting married religiously. Well, we'd have to buy another ring anyway, so...;
4. We'd still have my ring to keep and show our children in the future.

She swallowed her tears, I controlled my anger and we decided to sort it out together as the team we are! We rang the morning tour guide to ask her to look in the van to see if it had fallen there, we decided to go out for a walk and a coffee, when my wife started to get discouraged about the guide finding the ring, I took a pen and drew rings on our fingers to face the situation with good humour, and we went to a simple local shop to see about a temporary alternative to the religious wedding ring and she decided even when we would put them in our fingers (at the astronomic tour). She also started to make jokes about to buy silvertape to keep the ring on the right place.

Fortunately, after seven hours, the guide called us and said she'd found the ring. We were extremely grateful and my wife even bought her a bar of chocolate as a thank you.

But I have to confess that I wasn't as happy about the return of the ring as I was with my wife and myself about our behaviour. We acted respectfully towards each other to solve a problem and break a family cycle of everything being a big problem with people to blame. It's not my wife against me, it's my wife and me against the problem.",1,1737574585.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

Early game and mid game I was doing decent damage but misplaying badly, I believe I went 0/4/0 in lane due to no one's fault but my own. Maybe I'm just not that used playing with maxing W first or I needed more coffee. Needless to say, I was doing really bad.  
     
Furthermore, all our lanes were losing, even jungle, I was sure this would be a 100% loss, and even called an early surrender vote which I almost never do.    
    
Then during the team fights I noticed I am dealing up to *20% damage per hit* to champs like Viego, even though our opponents were building pure MR, and then I see my ult just obliterates everything in the way, my ult also helped us to contest over and steal 2 drakes and 1 baron. It really hits like a truck and has really short cooldown. We turned the game around then. Still, with all that I remained convinced I'm being carried because there's no way I am actually doing that much total damage apart from a couple pokes and snipes. Turns out I out-dps'ed everyone on my team, and I still don't know how.

* Mary's traditional- popular and delicious. 50-60 pesos per taco
*Rotisceria la Pechugas- 200 pesos for a whole roasted chicken with tortillas, rice and salsa. Papas for 40 peos more.
*Pizza Venezia- 200 pesos for a large pizza with your choice of topings.
*Cafe El Nayar- coffee roaster, will make any blend of fresh beans you want and grind for you. 80p for quarter lb.
*Pollas Yolanda- grilled chicken with tortillas, rice and salsa. 220 for a whole chicken. 
*Street tacos- al pastor tacos at Diaz or Tal Ivan, both at the town square. About 20p per taco.

We stopped at Mega in Bucerias to buy supplies for breakfast so can't comment on cafés or such, Sayulita Public House had a good burger and was fun to watch sports. We had dinner at Sayulita Cafe next to Marys and the tortilla soup was great, the rellenos were ok. 

I will update as we go and will be happy to answer questions to the best of my limited knowledge.   Salud!",2,1737573849.0,sayulita,3,0.75,False

1. You have to do this job from now until you turn 60 to get the retirement.

3. You do this job 40 hours a week, with 20 days off a year.

4. You can start your own business as part of this, but you have to do a job other than 'run the business.'

Freed from the shackles of having to worry about money for the rest of your life, but still having to have a job, what job is it that you'd choose?

You break the rules and become a hero. I do it, I become the enemy. That doesn’t seem fair.”

“To some, it's about trying to find the magic in your life. To others, it's about standing up and facing your fears. To many, it's about staying young at heart no matter how old you get. But everyone's story begins once upon a time...and it's up to us to cherish the time we're given to ensure we live happily ever after.”

""Then it won't be Wanda who comes for her. It will be the Scarlet Witch.”

“Try not to break the multiverse, Stephen.”

“I’m not a monster Stephen; I’m a mother.”

“Dream walking, you hypocrite!”

“No more mutants.”

“I just did. Do you know how it felt? It felt like that”.

“I can’t control their fear. Only my own.”

“You took everything from me.”

“Don’t look back. The past is exactly where  it belongs.”

“What mouth?”

“Is their mother still alive?”

""I have what I want, and no one will ever take it from me again.""

“Is this yours?”

“I don’t know how I did it. I only remember feeling completely alone. Empty. I just… Endless nothingness.”

""Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it, where do you think he gets that from?”

“You locked me in my room”. 

“You were pulling your punches.”

“This is our home.”

“I can’t feel you”

""Oh but they do. In every other universe. I know they do. Because I dream of them every night. Of my boys… of our life together. Every night the same dream, and every morning, the same nightmare.”

""Oh I think I can. This will be your only warning. Stay out of my home. You don’t bother me I won’t bother you.”

""You, Vision, are the piece of the Mind Stone that lives in me. You are a body of wires and blood and bone that I created. You are my sadness and my hope. But mostly, you're my love.""

""We will say hello again""

“We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.”

“Look, we’ve all been there, right? Letting our fear and anger get the best of us. Intentionally expanding the borders of the false world we created.”

“You know a family is forever. We could never truly leave each other even if we tried.” 

“You know the hex was the easy part; the lying, not so much.”

“I just feel you”

“We are an unusual couple, you know?”

“Oh don’t worry darling, I have everything under control.”

“Everybody’s afraid of something.”

“Sometimes it’s hard but sooner or later, every man shows himself.”

""I'll protect it. It's my job""

“You guys know I can move things with my mind, right?”

“I used to think of myself one way but after this, I am something else. And still me, I think. But that's not what everyone else sees.”

“That’s too high a price.”

“You will.”

“She knows. They both do.”

You move at the speed of sound, and I can make a pen float through the air. Who needs to abbreviate?”

“Well, life moves pretty fast out in the suburbs.”

“Are you using your night vision, Vision?”

“In a real magic act, everything is fake.”

“Boys, handle the military. Mommy will be right back.”

“Okay, so maybe I went a little to dark there. But they’ll be fine. Vision is made of vibranium. They literally inherited tough skin.”

“My husband and his indestructible head.”

“It’s probably just a case of the Mondays, am I right?”

“I’m a twin. I had a brother. His name was Pietro.”

“Here’s the thing boys, I’m your mom. And as such, you were counting on me to have all the answers, right? Well I don’t. I have no answers. Zero. Zilch. Zip. Nada. Niente. I’m starting to believe that everything is meaningless. I mean your welcome to draw your own conclusions, of course but that’s just where I’m at.”

“H-How could I let this happen?! This is all our fault!""

“Yeah, and you with it. I'm not having this conversation.”

“You could never.”

“Know that they'll be loved.”

“I blew a hole through the head of the man I loved. And it meant nothing. Do not speak to me of sacrifice, Stephen Strange. If you give me what I want, I’ll send you to a world where you can be with Christine.”

“I would never hurt you, never. I would never hurt anyone. I'm not a monster. I’m…I’m…I’m sorry.”

“The Multiverse. Viz had his theories. He believed it was real. And dangerous.”

“Yeah. I know what it's like. To be on your own, hunted for abilities you never wanted. I can protect her.”

“You never told me her name, did you?”

“You have no idea just how reasonable I've been.”

“Sending those creatures after her instead of myself was mercy. And in spite of your hypocrisies and insults I have begged you to safely get out of my way. You have exhausted my patience. But I do hope you understand. That even now, what's about to happen. This is me, being, reasonable.”

“They will never know or need to know what I did for them!”

“There are other Avengers.”

“I don't relish hurting anyone, Stephen. But she's not a child. She's a supernatural being. Such power could reap havoc on this and other worlds. Her sacrifice would be for the greater good.”

“Is it the one you use? When you gave Thanos the Time Stone?”

“Well, I knew sooner or later you’d show up wanting to discuss what happened at Westview. I made mistakes. And people were hurt.”

“They’ve been waiting for me. This isn’t a tomb, it’s a throne.”

“But I can! Look around you. It’s carved in stone. I was meant to rule everything. But that’s not what I want. I just want my boys.”

“The Darkhold only showed me the truth. Everything I lost can be mine again.”

“I’m going to leave this reality, and go to one where I can be with my children.”

“That’s what every mother does. If you knew there was a universe, where you were happy, wouldn’t you want to go there?”

“I know better than most what self-deception looks like.”

“Return to Kamar-Taj, and prepare to hand over America Chavez by sundown. Peacefully. After that, you’ll never see me again.”

“Then what are you here for?”

“Good. There will be someone left to raise them.”

“You’re still here.”

""You are my husband. You are Tommy and Billy’s father. Isn't that enough?”

“What do you say to silver dollar pancakes, crispy hash browns, bacon, eggs, freshly squeezed orange juice and black coffee?”

“Well, that explains the empty refrigerator.”

“Well, I know the apron is a bit much, dear, but I’m doing my best to blend in.”

“Well if you don’t know, I’m not going to tell you!”

“I don’t know what I was so worried about. It wasn’t so hard to fit in after all.”

“It’s just kinda taken us by surprise. It’s just kinda suddenly. Quite suddenly, wasn’t it? I mean practically overnight. I mean… how did this happen?”

Well, I think this line of questioning is fruitless.”

“We just don’t know what to expect.”

“Well, I’m not the one with the guns Director.”

“This, all if this, is for us. So let me handle it.”

“You don’t wanna know, I promise you.”

“You’ve never talked to me like this before.”

“Oh, god! There are! Just stop it!”

“Do you really think that I am controlling everything? That I am somehow in charge of everybody in Westview? I’m walking their dogs, mowing their lawns, getting them to dentist appointments on time? I mean, I… I don’t know how any of this started in the first place.”

“I’m a Sokovian fortune teller.”

“Why do you… look different?”

“I can’t believe what a bad influence you are.”

“What happened to your accent?”

“If you’re gonna break the sound barrier, please just take your brother with you.”

“Maybe I already am.”

“All you do is lie!”

“Boys, thanks for choosing me to be your mom.”

""In a given space, only the witch who cast them can use her magic. Thanks for the lesson. But I don’t need you to tell me who I am.”

“I’ve caused enough problems.”

“You're saying they'll come for me.”

“Oh, my god! What are you doing here?”

“Standard beat cops. Small station. Quiet street. It's a good target.”

“Yeah, the red one? It's cute.”

“It was time to get off my ass.”

“No. I’m over it. I want… I want to finish the plan. I want the big one.”

“You said we would destroy the Avengers. Make a better world.”

“When everyone is dead?”

“You keep stealing, you're going to get shot!... I mean it! At speed, nothing can touch you, but standing still...”

“Vis? Is it the stone again?”

“I looked in your head and saw annihilation.”

""I opened the Darkhold, I have to close it. No one will ever be tempted by the Darkhold again.” 

“How? What could you possibly have to offer me?”

“You're not my neighbor. And you're definitely not my friend. You are a stranger and an outsider. And right now you are trespassing here. And I want you to leave.”

The only thing that would bring me comfort is seeing him again. Sorry. I'm so tired. It’s just like this wave washing over me again and again. It knocks me down and when I try to stand up it just comes for me again. And I...It's just gonna drown me.”

“What makes you think that talking about it would bring me comfort?”

“What if you brought America here?”

“You’re familiar with the Darkhold?”

“You gave those lives just to keep me from my children.”

“At the end of the episode, you realize it was all a bad dream. None of it was real.”

“I’m not a witch, I don’t cast spells, no one taught me magic!”

“I’m not who you say I am!”

“It wouldn’t change how they see me.”

“I’m sorry. For all the pain I caused.”

“This is our home now. I want us to fit in.”

“In the infinite Multiverse, there’s a cure for every illness. A solution to every problem. I won’t lose them again.”

“Haven’t you had enough?”

“Perhaps we will be the exception.”

""I need the Darkhold spells. You are the Sorcerer Supreme. Tell me what you know.""

“Not you. Them.”

""I warned you.""

""Careful what you say to me""

""Or maybe I could just be myself? More or less?""

""Well, I don't think it's very funny. Why won't you do what I want?""

“The urge to run from this feeling is powerful, I know. There are rules in life. We can't rush aging just because it's convenient. And we can't reverse death no matter how sad it makes us.”

1i7j90x,https://i.redd.it/vstsw6jlhlee1.jpeg,"Totaled C8, why would they do this","Guys, I don’t even know where to start. I’m absolutely devastated. My Corvette… it’s gone. It’s totaled. And no, it wasn’t a crash, it wasn’t reckless driving, it wasn’t even the engine blowing up. No, it was… snow.

Let me take you back to how this nightmare unfolded.

It all started last night. I parked my car outside because the garage was, of course, temporarily unavailable. I made the calculated decision to leave my Corvette, my baby, my pride and joy, under the clear night sky. I checked the weather forecast – no snow predicted. NONE. A 0% chance. But I should’ve known. Weather apps? Lies. Mother Nature had other plans.

I wake up this morning, feeling a sense of dread I couldn’t explain. I walked to the window, sipping my coffee, and the world looked… different. White. Silent. Cold. I dropped the mug. It shattered on the floor. My heart sank. There it was, my Corvette, barely recognizable under a thin, horrifying layer of snow.

I ran outside, barefoot, ignoring the icy ground. The snowflakes looked innocent enough, but I knew better. They weren’t just snowflakes. They were malicious, calculated agents of destruction sent specifically to ruin my life. The car was covered in approximately 0.7 inches of snow – catastrophic, by any measure. I mean, this is a supercar, people. It wasn’t designed to withstand such an onslaught.

I gently brushed a bit of snow off the hood, and that’s when I saw it. The paint. It was no longer pristine. No longer the glossy, envy-inducing finish that turned heads at every red light. No, now it was… dull. The moisture from the snow had clearly seeped into the molecular structure of the paint, permanently compromising its integrity. I mean, what’s next? Rust? Oxidation? It’s not a Honda Civic. It’s a Corvette! It can’t handle this kind of abuse!

Then, I opened the door. Big mistake. The interior. A single flake of snow had somehow infiltrated the cabin. I could see it sitting there on the leather seat like a tiny, malevolent invader. Do you know what that does to leather? The moisture could cause stretching. Cracking. Aging. In one fell swoop, my interior went from “luxury” to “used car lot.” I was beside myself.

I checked the tires next, and of course, they were ruined. Snow had touched the rubber, and let me tell you, performance tires don’t just bounce back from something like that. The tread might as well have been sandpaper now. Useless. The car wouldn’t even dare move. I mean, technically it would, but spiritually? Emotionally? No. It was done.

And then, the final straw: the engine. I popped the hood, and somehow – I don’t even know how – snow had worked its way into the engine bay. Was it sabotage? A freak act of nature? I don’t know. But the sight of those flakes resting on the carbon fiber engine cover broke me. That’s when I realized it was over. The engine, with its 495 horsepower, had been reduced to a snowplow. It could never recover from this insult.

So here I am, carless, hopeless, and utterly defeated. People ask me, “Why don’t you just wipe the snow off and move on?” They don’t understand. They’ll never understand. This isn’t just a car. It’s a masterpiece. A machine of precision, grace, and power. And now? It’s just a statistic. A victim of the cruel winter.

RIP, Corvette. You were too good for this world. And to the snow that did this… I hope you melt into a puddle and evaporate into oblivion.",0,1737573327.0,Corvette,7,0.35,False

flash in the pan

there is the rub

a dog in the fight

a run for my money

a stick in the mud

a tough row to hoe

throw me under the bus

short end of the stick

put a thumb on the scale

by and large

in hot water

in the cards

in the works

my two cents

of two minds

up for grabs

up the creek

bed of roses

out on lunch

out to lunch

set in stone

all riled up

in for a penny in for a pound

in the cross hairs

go under the knife

my flesh and blood

get my hands dirty

let there be light

the coast is clear

ahead of the curve

armed to the teeth

pedal to the metal

speak of the devil

throw in the towel

tools of the trade

close but no cigar

a kid in a candy store

the point of no return

thank god it is friday

moving up in the world

youth is wasted on the young

teach an old dog new tricks

for better or for worse

all sizzle and no steak

get in on the ground floor

the genie is out of the bottle

light at the end of the tunnel

my bread and butter

you clean up nicely

asleep at the wheel

paddle my own canoe

beyond the shadow of a doubt

the benefit of the doubt

throw a wet blanket on it

cheaper by the dozen

diamond in the rough

dressed to the nines

meeting of the minds

waiting in the wings

running out of steam

heard it through the grapevine

as american as apple pie

put yourself in my shoes

all mouth and no trousers

bursting at the seams

changing of the guard

a changing of the guard

preaching to the choir

an ace up my sleeve

no man is an island

all hat and no cattle

a bee in my bonnet

put the brakes on

the cherry on top

castle in the air

letter of the law

seeing eye to eye

a dog in the manger

priced out of the market

in the toilet

lo and behold

on the bubble

to the letter

bag of tricks

eighty six it

fit as a fiddle

mad as a hatter

bet my bottom dollar

add insult to injury

bottom of the barrel

caught me red handed

monkey see monkey do

on the shoulders of giants

dressed up and nowhere to go

all it is cracked up to be

feather in my cap

my way or the highway

the tip of the iceberg

pulling my leg

i am checked out

let bygones be bygones

survival of the fittest

fox in the henhouse

a bone to pick

lend me a hand

turn on a dime

over my dead body

step up your game

boys will be boys

from soup to nuts

keep your chin up

once in a blue moon

give it your best shot

jump in with both feet

your guess is as good as mine

wash your hands of it

to know by heart

cash in my chips

fall on my sword

music to my ears

as a rule of thumb

as pale as a ghost

by hook or by crook

take it or leave it

ants in your pants

pull up your socks

come to grips with

chickens coming home to roost

blood is thicker than water

nothing to write home about

that touched my heart

nailing jelly to a wall

go down in flames

rain on my parade

your number is up

a card up my sleeve

stupid is as stupid does

best of both worlds

from rags to riches

give them an earful

from pillar to post

a little bird told me

beauty is only skin deep

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate.

But everything began to fall apart when I, during finals season, commented on the food she was eating. She was eating 4 burgers at once and a box of donuts and I was seriously concerned for her health. But she took my comment on her eating so much unhealthy food the wrong way as me ""calling her fat."" She isolated herself that day and I was left confused about what I did because she never even mentioned that I said something that offended her. (She always makes borderline racist/offensive jokes, so I didn't think she was the type to get offended so easily). 

The second time she did this, me and her planned an outing together for a long while and we had everything prepared and planned out. When we were discussing what to wear, I commented on how the things I would wear would often make me look like a mom next to her. That was a diss as myself- but she took it as a diss to her. Again, she isolated herself, cancelled the outing abrubtly AFTER I did my makeup and got ready, and did not explain what upset her and just shut me out leaving me confused and hurt and angry again because we had this all planned beforehand and I was already made up. I had to get my 3rd roommate (the same one as last time) to try to talk to her so that I can understand why should would just flip out and turn cold on me like that when I was so excited and ready to spend quality time with her.

My 3rd roommate after talking to her relayed to me the reason she got mad and again, I was left confused because I didn't understand my roommate's logic and lack of communication to me about what hurts her and what doesn't. I am always left in the aftermath of her cold anger without any idea what I did wrong. To apologize to her, I brought her favourite flowers and her usual coffee order. We made up.

Our relationship just completely crumbled from then on. And the breaking point was when me and her were discussing guys at our uni, and I mentioned that I liked a guy that she previously had a crush on, but never had a relationship with him or a situationship because he was not interested in her. I asked her several times if she was okay with this and if she felt hurt, and she replied always with a ""no, why would I?""

But then, she cut me off completely and refused to talk to me for a week, and I had no idea what the issue was. I asked her multiple times if the reason why because I liked the guy that she used to like. Four times she replied ""no that's not the reason."" She even swore on God that she didn't like him and she didn't care for him. So I believed her.She called us 'fucked up' for caring about her and why she would just isolate herself from us when we had an unbreakable bond.

Later in the week, she went ahead and told all my friends that I was the bad guy and quite frankly I think she manipulated them. I had to tell them that I literally have no idea.

Is she developing feelings for me?,"So I have been friends with an old coworker of mine for a several months now. We talked pretty casually as coworkers. She would often come to me about worries about what others think of her in the workplace and I thought nothing of it. Sadly she was laid off a few months ago. She was really close friends with another coworkers of ours who is also a mutual friend though, so us 3 and a mutual guy friend of ours (also a coworker) have been hanging out every week.

We first hung out at her close friend’s 21st birthday party which was a small gathering at a bar. The close friend’s in question was tired and wanted to leave early, so the girl in question went to drive her home but asked if I wanted to catch up more tonight since we hadn’t seen each other since she was laid off. The other guy went home early that night. That night we mainly just caught up and I thought nothing of it. We stayed another 2-3 hours just catching up. We started hanging weekly as a group after this. 

More recently (within the past 2 weeks) she has been texting me more individually. Mainly just a lot of “I’m bored” or “how’s your day been texts”. Which I still didn’t think much of because we’ve been hanging out more and she’s fun to talk to. This has usually been a daily thing.

A few days ago she asked our group if we could all hang out on Monday. I thought this was a bit weird since the previous day we had discussed it but found that the other two in our group weren’t available till Saturday. Still in case she forgot I just said I’m free, and then she texted me privately to ask what I wanted to do. She suggested coffee or playing some games at her apartment lobby. I said those sound good and made a remark about how my apartment doesn’t have anything besides the video games in my room. She then pivoted to hanging out at my place because video games sound fun (even though she’s never been a gamer). 

My room in my apartment isn’t very large so rather than having a chair to sit in to play games I usually do it on a bed. When we arrived she initially sat on the floor leaning against the bed, but moved up to me on the bed shortly after we started playing. She then got comfortable getting under the covers like I was with me, and started making jokes about how she was so comfortable that she was going to fall asleep. I just laughed it off, but she made this joke a few times more times. We played together for a few hours till it got late and I dropped her back off at home. 

She’s come over now every night DMing me if I was free to game in my apartment again and it’s been the same situation. She’s said she’s really starting to enjoy the games now and is excited to keep playing. I haven’t mentioned us hanging out one on one to either of our mutual friends, and neither has she as far as I’m aware. We still text daily, and it’s usually just about what we’re doing, stuff we like etc. She still confides in me about being nervous with her new coworkers or if some of her friends (who I haven’t met) are talking shit behind her back etc.

So my main question is, is she viewing me now more as a very close friend, or is she making subtle flirts. After spending more time with her I am interested, but I’m worried how it would affect our friend group dynamic regardless of the answer. I’ve also been told in the past by my exes that I’m horrible at reading hints from girls so any insight would be appreciated. ",1,1737572878.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I need to sleep for 12 to 15 hours a day but I also struggle to fall asleep. Usually I wake up around 3 or 4 pm and it’s a problem because school starts at 8 am and I’m missing lessons. I feel like shit because my family thinks I don’t care about school but I really just can’t physically get out of my bed. When someone wakes me up I’m so disoriented and unaware what’s going on that I don’t even realise I need to go to school and I feel like I’m still asleep. Most of the times I wake up after lessons are over. If I manage to get up at 7 am and force myself not to nap during the day, when I finally go to bed I can sleep even for up to 17 hours and miss another school day. I tried to take ambien so at least I can go to sleep earlier, but even if I take it around 11 pm(very early for me) I wake up at 11am so it’s still bad, and if I take it earlier it doesn’t work. I don’t know if it’s hypersomnia, because if I get my desired amount of sleep I don’t need to nap during the day. My sleep quality I think is pretty bad, because every time after waking up I get a headache. I’m so exhausted and I don’t know what to do anymore, I’ve had this problem since I was 15 and now I’m 19, apart from it I don’t have any health issues. There were periods of time when I would somehow get up every morning and drink so much coffee so I could stay up but during these times I would feel like my brain is deteriorating. I don’t have money for sleep studies or anything like that so please give me some tips how can I make it better on my own.",5,1737572650.0,idiopathichypersomnia,4,1.0,False

This is the living room of my new apartment. I have included a floor plan to this post.

I’m struggling to arrange my space in a way that allows me to work, relax, eat and host if needed. 

In an ideal world, I would have a sofa, coffee table, small dining table, as well as some plants. 

I previously had my desk in the 2 ft wide corner towards my hallway but have since moved it to get better zoom lighting/background.

I even have a separate can for 38 and 357, so I don’t have to sort it at home. If you’re looking for a lazy reloader, this is it. 

I have a Glock in 10mm, but it doesn’t get shot very much. I know it’s technically easier to shoot than a DA revolver, with 3x the capacity, but 357 gives me basically the same performance, just in a slightly more antiquated platform.

I realize I could reload for 10mm, but that’s just another pain in the neck. Not only would I have to buy dies for it, I’d need to chase brass, AND most brass is large pistol primer. 

I sort of like being able to just easily reload for 38 or 357, they both share the same primers, I don’t have the chase brass, same bullets and powders, basically same everything except the cases which I keep separate, and I bought a second die set so I don’t needs to adjust, and with my turret press I just drop in the collar with the dies loaded and go

Honestly I find myself favoring the revolver more often than not. It gets shot more at the range and carried more in the woods, I have more trigger time because it’s just less hassle, so I practice with it more, and therefore feel better with 357, even though I could have 3x the round count in a gun that’s technically “easier” to shoot.

Is it odd to turn my back on a “superior” platform in 10mm, pretty much only because it’s an expensive hassle?

### **Chapter 8: The Measure of Wellness**

The morning sun filtered through the wide windows of Sebastián’s study, casting warm light across the table where reports and charts had been neatly arranged. The discussion at hand was critical: health and education were the cornerstones of Sebastián’s long-term vision for Puerto Rico. The challenge was turning that vision into a sustainable reality.

Antonia Reyes entered quietly, carrying a tray of coffee and a folder marked with the insignia of the Ministry of Health. “Director Alondra Peralta is here,” she said, setting the tray down.

“Show her in,” Sebastián replied, rising from his seat.

Director Peralta, a sharp-eyed woman with graying hair tied neatly at the nape of her neck, entered the room carrying a thick portfolio. She exuded an air of efficiency, her movements precise, her expression purposeful.

“Governor Montalvo,” she said, shaking his hand. “Thank you for making time.”

“Director Peralta,” Sebastián replied. “I understand you’ve made progress on the feasibility study?”

She nodded, placing the portfolio on the table and opening it to reveal graphs, spreadsheets, and annotated maps.

---

A Plan for Sustainability

“The pilot project in Vega Alta has proven successful,” Peralta began. “The hospital and school we funded through industrial revenues are not only self-sustaining but also generating a surplus.”

Sebastián leaned over the table, studying the data. “How is that possible?”

“Local industries—primarily agroprocessing and textiles—have flourished under the cooperative model we implemented,” Peralta explained. “Profits from these industries fund healthcare and education, with additional support from public-private partnerships.”

She pointed to a graph. “We’ve also streamlined resource allocation by integrating healthcare and education into the same infrastructure. The school clinic doubles as a community health center, reducing overhead while increasing accessibility.”

Sebastián smiled faintly. “This is good news. But can it scale? At what order does it fail?”

Peralta hesitated. “It can, but it requires careful management. The key is fostering local industry in each region. Without that foundation, the model collapses.”

---

The Debate in the House of Lords

Later that day, Sebastián presented the findings to the House of Lords. The chamber was filled with murmurs as he detailed the success of the Vega Alta project.

“We have a blueprint for sustainable development,” Sebastián said, his voice steady. “It’s not a quick fix, but it’s a path forward. By prioritizing local industry and integrating healthcare and education, we can build a system that supports itself.”

Lord Vargas, a skeptic from the start, raised his hand. “And what of the costs? Initial investments aren’t cheap. How do you propose we fund the expansion without further straining the budget?”

Sebastián met his gaze. “Through collaboration. Public-private partnerships, foreign investment, and targeted tax incentives. The upfront costs are significant, but the long-term benefits far outweigh them.”

The chamber buzzed with debate, but by the end of the session, a consensus began to emerge.

---

The People’s Voice

In a quiet Barrio outside Ponce, Sebastián visited one of the clinics established under the pilot program. The building was modest but well-maintained, its walls adorned with colorful murals created by local students.

He watched as a nurse bandaged a child’s scraped knee while a teacher helped another group of children with their lessons. The integration of healthcare and education was seamless, a testament to the project’s success.

Sebastián spoke with a mother waiting in the clinic. “Madre, how has the program helped your family?”

She smiled, her eyes warm with gratitude. “It’s been a blessing. My children are learning, and we can see a doctor when we need to. Before this, we had to travel hours for basic care.”

---

Proof in Industry

That evening, Sebastián met with General Javier Ortega to discuss the next phase of the initiative.

“We’ve identified three regions where the model can be replicated,” Ortega said, spreading a map across the table. “Each has the potential for thriving industry—agriculture in the west, textiles in the south, and manufacturing in the east.”

“And the funding?” Sebastián asked.

“Investors are interested,” Ortega replied. “But they want guarantees. They’ll need to see detailed projections and timelines before committing.”

Sebastián nodded. “Then we give them the proof they need. Expand slowly, monitor progress, and build trust. This isn’t just about industry—it’s about the people.”

---

A Quiet Moment

As the day wound down, Sebastián sat in his study, reviewing the Vega Alta report one last time. The numbers were promising, but he knew the road ahead would be challenging.

Antonia Reyes entered with a glass of rum, setting it on the desk. “You’ve done well today,” she said softly.

Sebastián looked up, his expression thoughtful. “It’s not enough, Antonia. Not yet. But it’s a start.”

She smiled faintly. “Sometimes a start is all we need.”

### **Chapter 6: The Uneasy Crown**

The sun rose over New San Juan, painting the sky in soft hues of orange and pink. The city bustled with its usual energy, but beneath its vibrant surface, tensions simmered. Sebastián sat at his desk in Casa Montalvo, reviewing a dossier from Director Elena Morales. It was thick with reports of unrest, political maneuvering, and economic sabotage.

Antonia Reyes entered quietly, a steaming cup of coffee in hand. “The reports from the port just arrived,” she said, setting the cup down.

Sebastián nodded, though his attention was fixed on the dossier. “What’s the mood in New San Juan?”

“Cautious,” Antonia replied. “The workers are nervous, but the Port Authority is holding things steady. Director Morales sent word that another attempt at sabotage was intercepted last night.”

Sebastián closed the dossier with a sigh, leaning back in his chair. “The opposition is relentless. They think Barrera’s austerity measures weaken us, but it only makes our enemies bolder.”

---

A Meeting with Javier Ortega

General Javier Ortega arrived shortly after, his boots clicking against the marble floors of the study. He removed his hat respectfully as Antonia showed him in.

“General,” Sebastián greeted him. “What news from Cuba?”

Ortega sat across from him, his expression grim. “China's business presence is growing. They’ve secured contracts with key factions in Havana, promising development aid in exchange for influence.”

“And the Iron Spine?” Sebastián asked.

“Still operational, but barely,” Ortega admitted. “We’ve managed to keep their hands off the railway itself, but they’re pressing hard.”

Sebastián steepled his fingers, deep in thought. “We need to make the Cubans realize that a stronger Puerto Rico means a stronger Caribbean. Offer them guarantees—security, trade benefits. And if that fails, remind them of the reversion clause.”

Ortega raised a brow. “And if they state they've operated for years without a strong Puerto Rico?”

“Then I will invoke the reversion clause. If I must,” Sebastián said firmly. “But I’d prefer cooperation to conflict.”

---

The Santiago Family Returns

Later in the day, Judge Elena Santiago and her daughter Camila arrived at Casa Montalvo. They carried documents detailing the latest legal challenges against Barrera’s policies.

“Governor Barrera’s administration is exploiting every loophole it can find,” Elena began. “They’ve even tried to cut funding for the judiciary entirely.”

Sebastián glanced at the stack of papers. “And the courts?”

“Overwhelmed but holding,” Elena said. “For now. But without intervention, it’s only a matter of time before the backlog cripples us.”

Camila spoke up hesitantly. “There’s another issue, Governor. The cases tied to foreign influence—specifically Chinese and French interests—are being delayed intentionally. Someone’s protecting them.”

Sebastián’s jaw tightened. “Who?”

“We don’t have names yet,” Elena admitted. “But the trail leads back to Barrera’s inner circle.”

---

A Private Exchange with Isabella Vélez-Campo

As dusk fell, Sebastián found Isabella Vélez-Campo in the library, poring over a legal text. She looked up as he entered, her expression sharp and focused.

“You’ve heard about the judiciary’s struggles?” Sebastián asked, taking a seat across from her.

Isabella nodded. “It’s deliberate. Barrera’s administration is trying to undermine the courts to consolidate power. If we don’t act soon, they’ll succeed.”

“What’s your recommendation?” Sebastián asked.

“Use the House of Lords,” Isabella said. “They have the authority to intervene in cases of governmental overreach. It’s a drastic step, but it may be the only way to protect the judiciary.”

Sebastián considered her words carefully. “And what about the influences of the China and France?”

Isabella’s gaze hardened. “We’ll need more than legal measures for that. I’ll start assembling a team to trace the money and expose their networks.”

---

A Reflection on Power

That night, Sebastián sat alone on the balcony of Casa Montalvo, the city lights twinkling in the distance. He held a letter from Austria, its seal unbroken. It had been sent by Claudia Herrera, their ambassador in Vienna, but Sebastián hesitated to open it.

Antonia Reyes appeared beside him, her presence as calming as ever. “You’ve been quiet all evening,” she said.

Sebastián sighed. “Sometimes I wonder if I’ve done more harm than good. The alliances, the deals—they’re all fragile. And now Barrera is unraveling everything we built.”

Antonia placed a hand on his shoulder. “You’ve always known the risks, Sebastián. But you also knew the rewards. Puerto Rico is stronger because of you, even if it doesn’t feel that way right now.”

Sebastián gave her a faint smile. “Let’s hope you’re right, Antonia. The future depends on it.”",1,1737572298.0,hdfidelity,0,1.0,False

### **Chapter One: The Bargain**     
     
The late afternoon sun filtered through the stained glass windows of Sebastián Montalvo y Estrella’s private study in Casa Montalvo, casting fractured hues of gold and red across his desk. A map of Europe lay open before him, its edges curling with age. A faint coffee stain marked Vienna, a city that had come to dominate his thoughts of late.

Sebastián leaned back in his chair, the weight of the world pressing down on his shoulders. He traced the faint lines of Austria’s borders with his finger, his mind lost in the echoes of history. The intelligence reports piled beside him whispered of an Aryan resurgence—a threat cloaked in beauty, seduction, and the allure of cultural superiority.

The sound of footsteps broke his reverie. The door opened, and Prime Minister Javier Ríos entered, followed by Isabella Vélez-Campo. Both wore expressions that matched the storm brewing outside the mansion walls.

“Thank you for coming,” Sebastián said, gesturing to the chairs opposite him.

Ríos sat heavily, his brow furrowed. “You didn’t leave us much of a choice. Your summons sounded like a fire alarm.”

Sebastián gave a faint smile, though it didn’t reach his eyes. “It is a fire. One we may not be able to put out.”


---

An Uneasy Alliance

Isabella leaned forward, her sharp eyes scanning the map. “Austria. That’s where the reports are coming from?”

Sebastián nodded. “It’s not just a resurgence—it’s an echo of something buried. A movement leveraging art, culture, and charm to mask its real intentions. We’re seeing the same rhetoric, just wrapped in a prettier package.”

Ríos’s jaw tightened. “Beauty as a weapon. It’s an old trick, but effective. People are drawn to it, captivated before they realize the poison beneath.”

Sebastián stood, pacing the room. “It’s not just beauty. It’s the momentum of history. This isn’t a new problem—it’s a consequence of an old bargain.”

Isabella frowned. “The deal from the independence negotiations?”

Sebastián stopped, his back to them, and stared out the window. “Yes. The deal that tied Puerto Rico’s expansion to Austria’s resurrection. Two hearts bound across oceans, beating in rhythm until one falters. And now, it’s faltering.”


---

The Seduction of Power

The narrative shifted to a Viennese gala, where Puerto Rican Ambassador Claudia Herrera navigated a sea of opulence and elegance. Chandeliers dripped with crystal, their light refracting off gilded walls. Music played softly in the background, the strains of a violin weaving through the murmurs of conversation.

Claudia adjusted her shawl, her eyes scanning the room. She was here to observe, to gather intelligence on the Austrian elite. But the atmosphere was intoxicating, a heady blend of charm and danger.

A voice cut through the air like silk. “Ambassador Herrera, I presume?”

Claudia turned to see Countess Helena von Strasser, a vision of poise and grace. Her smile was disarming, her gaze sharp as a blade.

“Countess,” Claudia replied, her tone measured.

Helena gestured toward the ballroom. “Do you enjoy Vienna? It has a way of captivating the soul, does it not?”

“It’s certainly captivating,” Claudia said, her voice cool. “Though I imagine that’s the point.”

Helena’s laugh was soft, melodic. “You’re perceptive. Beauty is a language all its own, Ambassador. It speaks directly to the heart, bypassing reason and doubt. Perhaps that’s why it’s so often misunderstood.”

“Or weaponized,” Claudia countered.

Helena tilted her head, her smile never wavering. “A matter of perspective, perhaps. But tell me, what does Puerto Rico see when it looks at Vienna?”

Claudia held the Countess’s gaze. “A lesson.”


---

Leviathan Awakens

Back in Casa Montalvo, Sebastián sat alone in his study, the map of Europe now accompanied by a stack of reports from Director Ernesto Morales. Each page detailed Austria’s resurgence, its cultural revival, and the growing whispers of a new ideology.

He picked up a letter from Claudia, her observations from Vienna painting a vivid picture of the danger ahead.

Claudia’s Letter:     
*The Countess is everything we feared—charismatic, cunning, and utterly devoted to the cause. She uses beauty to veil her intent, and it works. People are drawn to her, even as she guides them toward ruin. The movement is growing, Sebastián, and it’s only a matter of time before it crosses borders.*

Sebastián set the letter down, his mind racing. He turned to the map, his fingers tracing the stained mark over Vienna.

“The beast cannot be destroyed,” he murmured to himself. “But it can be contained.”

His reflection stared back at him from the window, the fading light casting his features in shadow. The road ahead was clear, though fraught with peril. If Austria’s resurrection threatened the balance, then he would be the one to restore it.

As a result of Winter Storm Enzo, the temperature dropped down to 11 degrees last night, which is the lowest I can ever recall it getting here in my 50 years of living. 

Unfortunately, the wiring wasn’t done properly when the cabin was built. After I bought it, I learned that I can’t run two space heaters in it at once without flipping a breaker. Naturally, I chose for the one heater to be in my bedroom last night. 

When I woke this morning and walked in the kitchen, I saw a layer of ice in a bowl of water that was sitting in my sink. I opened my freezer to get my coffee out (I have always stored it there). I heard a light humming noise and some fast clicking. I immediately unplugged the refrigerator and have left it that way.

I can't even tell anyone on there about how I'm switching to Reddit or Instagram until the problem is resolved. I posted 4 hours ago about coffee and tell them about how I'm going to be gone for a few hours due to a consultation I have in a couple hours, and now suddenly I can't do anything. I got a warning for a picture I sent of a plate of PANCAKES. Fucking PANCAKES that I had for breakfast a couple days ago because they thought it was GORE. It had strawberry jam, but still, PANCAKES?

1i7ila7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i7ila7/aita_for_liking_my_roommates_ex_crush/,AITA for liking my roommate's ex crush?,"I (18F) and my roommate (18F) are no longer on talking terms after we had a great bond and deep friendship. Me and her were as close as sisters and I thought that nothing could ever break us apart. That's how close we were. 

But everything began to fall apart when I, during finals season, commented on the food she was eating. She was eating 4 burgers at once and a box of donuts and I was seriously concerned for her health. But she took my comment on her eating so much unhealthy food the wrong way as me ""calling her fat."" She isolated herself that day and I was left confused about what I did because she never even mentioned that I said something that offended her. (She always makes borderline racist/offensive jokes, so I didn't think she was the type to get offended so easily). I had to get my 3rd roommate to try and break her out of her shell to explain why she just disassociated completely without warning or explanation. We made up after my other roommate got her to talk.

The second time she did this, me and her planned an outing together for a long while and we had everything prepared and planned out. When we were discussing what to wear, I commented on how the things I would wear would often make me look like a mom next to her. That was a diss as myself- but she took it as a diss to her. Again, she isolated herself, cancelled the outing abrubtly AFTER I did my makeup and got ready, and did not explain what upset her and just shut me out leaving me confused and hurt and angry again because we had this all planned beforehand and I was already made up. I had to get my 3rd roommate (the same one as last time) to try to talk to her so that I can understand why should would just flip out and turn cold on me like that when I was so excited and ready to spend quality time with her. 

My 3rd roommate after talking to her relayed to me the reason she got mad and again, I was left confused because I didn't understand my roommate's logic and lack of communication to me about what hurts her and what doesn't. I am always left in the aftermath of her cold anger without any idea what I did wrong. To apologize to her, I brought her favourite flowers and her usual coffee order. We made up.

Our relationship just completely crumbled from then on. And the breaking point was when me and her were discussing guys at our uni, and I mentioned that I liked a guy that she previously had a crush on, but never had a relationship with him or a situationship because he was not interested in her. I asked her several times if she was okay with this and if she felt hurt, and she replied always with a ""no, why would I?"" 

But then, she cut me off completely and refused to talk to me for a week, and I had no idea what the issue was. She would be normal with everyone else in the friend group except me and my 3rd roommate (the one that usually does the resolving between us). Me and my 3rd roommate forcibly got her out to talk to us like adults and tell us why she is upset with us. I asked her multiple times if the reason why because I liked the guy that she used to like. Four times she replied ""no that's not the reason."" She even swore on God that she didn't like him and she didn't care for him. So I believed her. Because why would a mature person lie about something like that? She called us 'fucked up' for caring about her and why she would just isolate herself from us when we had an unbreakable bond. 

Later in the week, she went ahead and told all my friends that I was the bad guy and quite frankly I think she manipulated them. I had to tell them that I literally have no idea what she is mad about. She told my ex (who remains my friend) that the reason she's mad is because I like the guy that she liked. So she WAS in fact lying, 4 times. And I was somehow the bad guy for not knowing?! 

I just can't seem to understand why she would lie and refuse to communicate with me whenever she is upset. Why does she just storm off to her room, block me, and then refuse to talk like adults and settle the matter? I feel that she is childish. That I often felt like I was walking on eggshells in our friendship lest I accidentally offend her without realizing and then I get the cold shoulder for days on end without an explanation.

First, we realized the error of our ways (yes, we hate the vending machines as much as you do) and we are bringing back a coffee/ice cream/snack cafe area in the former Starbucks/Piner & Coffey space. We haven't finalized the name yet, but you already get the gist. It will be open during our busy hours throughout the week.

Next, we are working with another local business to install three escape rooms here at Epicenter! The first will likely be ready in the late March timeframe.

1i7ik9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1i7ik9o/untitled_karen_at_the_coffee_shop_being_a_jerk/,untitled karen at the coffee shop being a jerk…,"A woman walked into the coffee shop with an air of purpose. She was dressed in a sharply tailored suit, her posture straight, and her gaze scanning the room as if she were evaluating the space itself. The barista behind the counter greeted her with a practiced smile.

""Good morning! What can I get for you today?""

She paused, her finger tapping thoughtfully on the counter. ""A grande latte, but with oat milk, no foam, and extra hot. Also, can you make sure it's in a ceramic cup? I don’t like paper.""

The barista nodded, jotting down the details. ""Got it. Extra hot, no foam, oat milk, ceramic cup.""

She studied the barista for a moment, as if weighing something, before speaking again. ""And could you make sure you steam the oat milk separately? Sometimes the texture isn’t right if it’s all in one pitcher.""

A flicker of surprise crossed the barista’s face, but they nodded, too polite to comment. ""Of course, I'll take care of that.""

The woman slid her credit card across the counter, not quite looking the barista in the eye. ""Thank you. I’m in a bit of a rush, so if you could have it ready quickly, that would be great.""

The barista hurried to prepare the drink, making sure every detail was followed to the letter. As the latte was handed over, the woman gave a brief nod of approval, grabbed it delicately, and walked to the door.

Her exit was almost imperceptible, but to the other customers in line, it was as if the air had subtly shifted. There was a sense that she had gotten exactly what she wanted, in exactly the way she wanted, without ever raising her voice.

She was the kind of person who got things done.",0,1737571716.0,AmITheJerk,13,0.41,False
1i7iizn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1i7iizn/what_to_do_and_not_do_when_a_girl_is_interested/,What to do (and not do) when a girl is interested in you,"For some background: I'm a fairly promiscuous 30 year old woman. I've dated a lot and figured I'd come here and share with you common mistakes men tend to make that make them go from ""Yes, please!"" to ""I really wish you didn't live on the same continent as me."" This advice is specifically written with men who are looking to date women in mind but a lot of this is general enough to apply in different situations too. For those of you who don't already know dating, especially online dating, for most women is a process whereby we see a lot of cute guys we'd love to get with and then go trough a process of fairly boring social interactions to figure out if the guys in question are first and foremost dangerous but secondarily, would actually be people sex would be fun with. Please keep this in mind as we move forward. Now of course, when people are dating seriously with the goal of long term partnership there's also the additional dimension of trying to make sure you have compatible values and lifestyles. The advice bellow is not going to cover that aspect of dating.

**Be normal.** As an autistic person myself, I understand the deep burning desire to not shut up about whatever niche hobby thing you're currently obsessed with. It's legitimately hard. This applies to everything, not just your Warhammer 40k miniature collection. No girl (figurative) wants to listen to you describe your workout routine, hear your thesis on why Porches are better than BMWs or get caught up on the intricate details of your favorite sports team.

You're obviously allowed to mention your interests an hobbies but on first dates, try to stick to normie topics. I'm a conventionally attractive woman and people still think it's fucking weird if I say more than 3 consecutive enthusiastic sentences about Minecraft. The point of a first date is to demonstrate to each other you're well adjusted enough to have a fun time with.

Is this advice ableist? Yeah, kinda. In a perfect world people would be open-minded and informed enough about autism and generally kind enough to appreciate someone just being extra about that one thing they really like to be appreciative of someone trying to share that joy. However, we don't live in that world so this is my earnest advice. 

\[Realistically, there will be situations where doing the literal opposite of what I just said is the correct move. If you ever meet someone who's really into the same things you're really into, nerding out together will be way more successful but that rarely ever happens. Unless you're 100% sure both of you are the same kind of weird, talk about movies you both watched.\]

**Don't be a creep.** I know a lot of you will read this and go ""Yeah, right. It's only creepy if the guy isn't hot."" That's cope. The number of chiseled, well dressed dudes I refused to even get coffee with because they couldn't behave is too damn high. It's also a much higher number than the number of average looking guys I ended up sleeping with because they were charming, respectful and personable.

What is and isn't creepy, isn't a list of things to do or not to do, except for like the really obvious red flags. When you meet a woman who's kinda into you she will be somewhere on a spectrum from intrigued to open to listening to you describe what you would do to various body parts of hers, with various body parts of yours, in graphic detail. Successful flirting is meeting the energy the person you're with is giving off. Creepy is when she kinda maybe wants to feel up your arm and you respond to that by telling her you have a raging erection.

\[Really obvious red flags include but are not limited to: stalking, stalkerish behavior, joking about violence against women, joking about violence in general, getting mad when left on read, being overly self-deprecating and whiny, etc.\]

Do hot men get away with more? Seemingly sure but that's only when you don't understand that they're simply reciprocating the vibes they're getting. Pretty privilege is real; people want to have sex with attractive people. That doesn't mean nobody wants to do you if you're average, it just means that if you don't look like you're a swimsuit model when a woman is interested in you, she's probably going to be closer to the intrigued side of the spectrum.

So, how do you actually match the energy if you're a socially inept autistic potato like myself? Simple; just copy whatever they're doing. She says you have nice eyes, you say she has a great smile. She touches your knees, you touch her shoulder. And at the end of the day, if you're unsure you can always ask. As an example, say you're on a date, it's going well but you're not sure if the vibes are there yet to kiss her. Don't say ""Can I kiss you?"" (Though to be clear, this works plenty too.) try ""I would really enjoy kissing you now. Would you like me to that?"" or ""Would you like it if I kissed you now?"". You don't come off as demanding, needy or award and you're also communicating that you're very much interested in meeting her desires.

If the conversation gets steamy, it's always preferable to stick to euphemisms. Sure, being explicit can be fun and exciting and there's definitely a time and space for that but if your date is not talking in a way where the conversation would end up a long beep interrupted by adjectives on daytime TV, you shouldn't be speaking like that either. ""I like exploring down south. ;)"" is fun and flirt. ""I want to eat your p\*\*\*\*"" is vulgar and aggressive.

Bonus cheat: If you actually become good, genuine friends with women they will help you flirt with other women. Women often co-author each others flirty banter with guys and they will do the same for you if you're actually their friend.

**Be nice, not a doormat.** Let's start this one off with an example. I smoke, yes terrible I know. The guy I went on a date didn't. When we go back to his place he goes: ""Hey, I got this new mouth wash and I think it's so weirdly fruity. Would you mind trying it for me?"" Now, I know what he meant and he knows what he meant but instead of telling me my breath stinks he was nice about it and demonstrated that he has self respect and expects people to treat him the way he feels he deserves.

You need to be kind to people but you also need to have self respect. When you don't, you end up attracting people who will walk all over you because why would they respect you if you don't respect yourself?

**Eagerness is hot, pushiness is not.** As a general rule, women like to feel desired. What women don't like is feeling preyed upon. Say you ask a girl out and she says she'd like to talk more first. This is the point where you refer back to the introductory paragraph, remember she's just trying to make sure you're not a serial killer and be your most charming self. This is not an opportunity to re-ask that question on a solid schedule even if the vibes haven't shifted.

Let's take another example: A woman sends you a nice picture of her in lingerie. What you do is say thank you, you compliment her on looking nice and if you want to be extra you can compliment her lingerie. What you don't do is respond with ""Damn girl, you should really send me a nude next."" Is this an oddly specific situation I'm personally upset with because it happened to me? Sure. Does it make it any less of a good example? No, it's actually a great example because I stopped talking to that dude.

All people are a little egotistical. Take advantage of this by acting interested, asking question and follow up questions. Let your date talk about themselves. Do I care about winter sports? No. Did I non the less intently listen and ask multiple questions about my dates armature skiing career? Hell, yes. This has nothing to do with your personal interest in any given topic and everything to do with making the person you're with feel special and interesting.

**Clean your room.** You meet a nice lady, you guys talk, go on a couple of dates and she agrees to come over to your place. Now what? You clean up is what. Nothing kills the mood faster than seeing day old dishes in the sink, a disheveled bed and dust on furniture. Have clean bedsheets, without stains, without holes. Have your essentials like, condoms, lube, tissues, wet wipes, massage oil and marital aids somewhere close to your bed. The first 3 items on that list are mandatory. Have a small trash can somewhere within arms reach, and if not that, than some sort of dedicated container for used condoms and tissues. Have your Spotify playlist ready to go and if you can afford it, splurge on some mood lighting. The effort will be appreciated.

In case anybody still needs to hear this in 2025, just because a girl agrees to come over, doesn't mean she's consenting. Don't drop your pants the moment she walks in the door and refer back to the entirety of this list throughout her visit. If you guys are going to watch a movie, pick a boring movie. You should at all times be more interesting than whatever is going on on screen. If she just wants to make out on the couch with you, pretend you're in high school and enjoy a good time. She's much more likely to come back if she doesn't feel pressured into situations she's uncomfortable with. Asking for consent is not cringe, it's sexy. Refer back to the ""Don't be a creep"" segment. Phrase questions not in terms of ""Will you let me do X,Y,Z, to you?"" but rather in terms of ""Would you like me to.../ Do you enjoy it when..."" You can also say things like ""Id like it if you *insert thing you would like her to do to/with you""* but keep matching the energy and don't be vulgar. Ideally, sex is something you'd like to do with someone and not to someone.

Go out there, have fun and enjoy yourselves. I've dated a lot and even I sometimes say and do things that are award, I make jokes that don't land and misread situations. It happens. It will inevitably happen. Don't fixate on it. Take the L and move on. You're not going to be everybody's cup of tea no matter what you do. There's women out there who will look at Hugh Jackman and gag and there's women out there thirsting over a noseless Walton Goggins. Regardless of what mesosphere weirdos say, the bar for men is actually under the floor. Be nice, charismatic and personable and you're going to do great out there.",2,1737571631.0,dating_advice,6,0.75,False

When choosing tournaments, it can be really hard to know what you are getting in advance.

  
This was a really well run tournament: 

* 5 game guarantee
* All of our games were at the same facility with 8 sheets of ice (NCS Super Rink)
* Games started on time or very close to the scheduled time. The only delay we saw was due to a prior games that ran slightly over (15 min max delay we saw)
* Many hotel options nearby
* Many restaurant options that were friendly for team dinners:
   * Invictus Brewing
   * Bricks
* Food & Coffee options at the rink
* On-site skate sharpening
* We were able to take our team to see Big 10 College Hockey. The University of Minnesota Men's and Women's teams were in town for games over the weekend.
* Large airport MSP nearby (20-25 minutes airport to rink)
* Our division was well-balanced
* Many outdoor skating opportunities and friendly outdoor games hosted as part of the tournament

1i7iei4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1i7iei4/dear_claudia/,Dear Claudia,"We’re getting close to five months now. A lot has changed, a lot of things that I wish I could show you.

I’ve reread your letter several times. You’re correct on all of it. My insecurities, my pushiness, everything. I wish I could say that that wasn’t true, but it was. I look back on that time and I’m a completely different man. I’m sorry it took losing someone who loved me mind, body, and soul to do that.

I’m with someone now. I don’t know how it’s gonna go, but she’s moving in this weekend. She has a kid, Claudia. A five-year-old son who is an absolute little genius. Honestly, I love him. If you and I ever did get back together in the future, which who knows what the future holds, I’d still be fine with not having kids, but I realized how much I like them. He honestly is a pleasure to be around, and teaching him about the world is a magical experience. 

I wish we could talk like adults. I wish we could meet up over coffee or something and just actually have closure. Don’t get me wrong. I understand. The lack of closure is very much my fault. Hell you leaving is to except for the Florida stuff which I understand, believe me, it’s getting unbearable for me too.

It sucks. I love my new girl. However, I can’t stop thinking about you. About how we literally gave ourselves pieces of our souls. Do you remember that? Behind Marcus’s house? I still feel it to this day. I feel like you are missing me honestly.

I wish I could show you. I’m a changed man, but I doubt you’ll ever give me the chance. I’ve grown financially and independently and how I would be able to help share the burden you wouldn’t be holding 90% of it anymore. I am sorry for doing that. I have no excuse. I was a spoiled child and I know that.

I don’t know how things are gonna go with this new girl because things have been rough lately. She’s still moving in, and that still makes logical sense given her business. But I would not lie to you, and say that I’m not worried.

But you know me. Can’t be alone. But I’m not making the same mistakes I made with you. We’re never gonna have a joint bank account. We’re never gonna really join our lives together not unless things get very very serious. She’s OK with that too.

I wish I didn’t miss you. I wish I didn’t say the things that I said to you because you did try. I know you did. I wish I could bear you 6 feet under the ground and walk away, but I just can’t. I wish you’d give me another chance honestly. It’s a fucked up thing to say given my current situation, but it’s so fucking true and I hate that.

I’m curious how you have changed. I noticed you’re no longer living with Fallon. You’re in Greenville now. I hope it’s not with whoever you were dating. I really do. Don’t make the same mistakes I’m making. 

If you see this by chance, please talk to me. Please. I’ve changed so much in such a short period of time and I’m only gonna change more. Losing you taught me so much. I would move to Greenville in a heartbeat to be with you. I would abandon everything here. I feel comfortable saying that because I don’t think it’s actually gonna happen. But if it does, I would.

I know you loved me. I know you still do in many ways. I loved you too. More than the moon loves the Earth, more than the sky loves the stars. In my opinion, we were just meant to be. It just didn’t work out this time around. It could if we just talk, but I don’t think that’s gonna happen is it? Not for years anyway.

I don’t feel safe around you yet. The mere idea of seeing you in person sends me into conniptions to tell you the truth. I doubt you feel safe around me either. I was at a wreck at the end. So were you. 

If you see this and you send this to my current girlfriend, that’s on me. Do what you want. But I’ve always been an honest person when it comes to emotions. That reminds me you’d be proud of me for not lying anymore. I refuse to do it. Even if it makes me come off as lame, even if it makes me not be able to get the things I want, I just can’t anymore. I literally panic if I do. I refuse to be the person who lost you. I’d love to be the person. Who gets you back, years from now when we’re both grown.

Please, maybe five years from now at least talk to me. Just do that at least. I mean, if you wanna try to reconnect our lives, I will always be OK with that. Always. But that’s up to you.

I’ll miss you forever. My soulmate. Goodbye.

Maybe soon we can actually see each other again and kiss one more time. All I want is just a life with you and the Kava bar. I don’t care about anything else. I would sacrifice my very legs, eyes ears, mouth and life for that. For one more shot. ",1,1737571325.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False

I spend my time either in that recliner, or at my desk (not pictured). I don't have a TV setup. I don't entertain often. I don't \*need\* more than my chair, my desk, and my bed, but it leaves the place feely empty.

I'm seeking ideas for how to fill in the room, make it feel more homey, etc.

My thoughts so far are to get some more chairs or a love seat, a coffee table, maybe some side tables to put against the wall with lamps or plants on them. I have pictures I can put up on the walls. But, I don't have a clear idea in my head about how I would fill this space.",1,1737571312.0,interiordecorating,1,1.0,False

LONG POST - Breakdown of my side effects and experiences

In total, my side effects by month (Month 1-3):
From the start i took 1/2 dose in the morning, 1/2 at night with 1200mg Fish Oil pills with each dose (Welby from Aldi) and I'll have PB&Js in the morning, and a decent sized meal for dinner. I don't know if it actually makes a difference but I have probably doubled (and same days even tripled) the amount of fat in my diet. I have actually lost weight since starting - sort of expected as my metabolism seems to work really well with a high fat diet, but this may have also helped with reducing side effects based on a bunch of random studies I read and my derm saying it could help.

July/Aug - Month 1 - 40mg a day

* Started my period 7 days early - might be unrelated but I'm pretty regular so it def felt related
* Random Sahara Desert level dry patch on both thighs - cleared up within 2 days
* My other meds can cause headaches if I get dehydrated so I am now much much more prone to headaches - not too much of a problem, just have to be aware of how much water I drink
* Woke up one morning in the middle of week 3 and couldn't turn my head to the left - thought I slept wrong but it lasted for like 2 weeks. Deadass Batman turning my whole upper body just to look to my left. Derm said to keep an eye on it and tell her if it doesn't get better, but still bumped me to 60mg/day

Aug/Sept - Month 2 - 60mg a day

* Stiff neck went away slowly but finally can turn head to the left.
* Exhaustion setting in pretty bad now - I constantly had this ""I'm just so tired"" feeling that would make me cry - I knew this was highly likely to happen. Mood stabilizers can only do so much and it was my dad's birthday this month which is still a rough one for me
* The edge of my lips felt sunburnt all the time, like I burnt them on hot coffee or sat in the sun too long but they weren't dry just spicy feeling
* Dry eyes a few days here and there but nothing major - could be due to exhausted feeling or forgetting to blink (ADHD be like that sometimes)
* Week 2 of this month I woke up and could not form legitimate thoughts. The brain fog was unreal. I couldn't remember words and bombed a presentation I had to give for work. Embarrassing and made me cry. I would try to talk and be unable to find the words, get super frustrated, and then cry. This fog took till the end of month 2 to start to lift. This was one of the worst ""side effects"" I had because I kept telling myself it wasn't Accutane but I still do not know. This was an emotional two weeks lol
* I drove to my appointment (10 minute drive there 10 minutes back) and the left side of my face and left arm was \***sunburnt**\*. I had sunscreen on, I had heavily tinted windows. I literally do not know what happened but I will say till this point if I went outside it was either in the late afternoon/evening or I took an umbrella or wore sleeves and a hat. No clue but made me more cautious

Sept/Oct - Month 3 - 80mg a day

* My skin is paper. I get cuts from bumping into dull objects. My fingers are peeling where you would usually get hang nails and I was cutting something in the garden with gloves and and took a 2 inch section of skin off my finger from it rubbing the glove. WILD. Took 2 weeks to heal - still discolored.
* Week 2, neck stiffness was back - couldn't turn left (I woulda SUCKED if I was in NASCAR) and then halfway through week 3 I woke up and it had moved down to the dead center of my back. Felt like I slept wrong but I could not rotate my upper body or lean to fast in any direction. Its still a little sore feeling but is going away.
* Cuts in my nostrils are ROUGH. I get these weird dry pieces of skin the peel off in there no matter how much Aquaphor or Vaseline I put up there. Probably to most annoying thing of all. It is driving me absolutely \*crazy\* but is a small price to pay for skin that doesn't make me believe I am ugly (thanks mom for that looping thought the last 15 years) and to not have my face bones ache lol
* Lips are swollen but mainly because they are peeling and I am anxious picking them - I catch myself too late after I've already ripped pieces off. I am trying to stop I know this is bad.
* Similar to above. I have 3 small pimples on my forehead and 2 on my left cheek that I anxiously rubbed/scratched and are now small scabs. The ones on my cheek are dark red/discolored. Totally my fault and I am trying to get myself to chill out or at least be more aware of me touching my face.
* I woke up this morning with a small pimple on my eyelash line. I know what you're thinking... ""That's just a sty, dude."" Nope, small little pimple. Washed my face as normal and came out and is now gone. No clue man but an odd one I had to mention lol

Oct/Nov - Month 4 - 80mg a day
* Skin is still paper and I feel like I was hit by a Mack Truck. 
* I went to the desert with my family for a week. let me tell you, this was a wildly unpleasant experience lol. I didn’t get to have my morning PB&J’s or higher fat dinners. I wore long sleeve rash guards and hats to keep my skin out of the sun but broke out in sever heat rash. It looked like I was having an allergic reaction to the sun. No amount of sunscreen, thick sleeves, sitting in the shade, drink ing water or cold showers could save me. Horrible. 
* Nose cuts are still going strong and I feel like any time I sneeze I am swallowing a little bit of blood for the next 30 minutes
* It’s like my body is doing everything it can to sleep wrong so I was yet again batman for at least a solid week in the month. 

Nov/Dec - Month 5 - 80mg a day
 
* I am exhausted and pretty much always sore like I ran a marathon
* My skin finally feels smoother than it ever has
* I thought this would be my last month but the last week, I have a huge cyst pop up on my forehead. it literally looked like I smack an open cabinet with my head. Wildly frustrating. It never came to the surface and just sorta… went away? of course this resulted in me having to do one more month

Dec/Jan - Month 6 - 80mg

* Severe spine pain like i’ve never experienced between my shoulder blades. Super uncommon as the back pain is typically in the lower spine or sciatic area, but nope. mine was dead between my shoulder blades. Horrid and turning over in bed would literally knock the wind out of me. Sleeping has been a nightmare and I am never comfortable. Heating pads and ice sometimes help but not every time.   
* Still got that paper skin baby i bumped the corner of a wall and my skin on my elbow literally just like tore?
* Nail infection!! On my pointer finger, totally randomly, but where you might get a hang nail just got really really angry. red painful and unpleasant looking. I soaked with betadine solution, UNSCENTED epsom salt and hot water 2x a day. it lasted a bit over a week but is just now going away. 
* I am so burnt out and am so so ready to be done. I feel so confident in my skin and am so proud of myself but my body aches and I need some sleep lol

Just got home from my Derm and I am finally done. I nearly cried and I cannot tell you how long 13 years of waiting to finally feel “pretty” and to not be in constant pain has been.  It was not easy, it was not pleasant, it was one of the most physically difficult things i’ve been through in a minute, but mentally I have literally never been better in my life. I can look in the mirror and not hate myself over acne i couldn’t control or compulsions to pick my skin I couldn’t kick. I can talk to people and not wonder if they think my face looks gross. I leave the house with nothing more than some sunscreen and mascara and it is so freeing. 

I would go through this 10x over just to be where I am at today because even though it was difficult, it was so so worth it. ",2,1737571299.0,Accutane,2,1.0,False

Hey,
I’m trying to navigate life with equal parts curiosity, sarcasm, and (occasionally) uncertainty. I’m usually introverted, but with the right people, I light up and can be the life of the conversation. My humor leans dark and witty, but I promise I’m just a laid-back, chill person looking for meaningful connections.

Right now, life feels a bit heavy.I’ve realized how much I miss having someone to truly talk to. I’m hoping to find someone I can share my thoughts with—someone kind, witty, and supportive. A nurturing presence who’s not afraid to open up.

A little about me: I’m big on health and self-care—gym, eating right. I’m also a decent cook, and coffee is my love language (the darker, the better). I love traveling and hiking; nothing clears my mind better than nature. When it comes to conversations, I crave deep, emotional, and spiritual discussions. I’m also someone who treasures quiet moments and comfortable silences, though I know they’re rare.

I’m not here with a fixed plan—I just want something genuine. Let’s talk, share stories, and maybe discover something wholesome together. If we click, great! If not, at least we tried. Bonus points if you’re into art, poetry, or anything creative—I’m a sucker for that kind of passion.

Life’s been tough lately, and I won’t lie—I’ve had my moments of feeling lost and lonely. But I’m working on it, one step at a time. If you’re someone who values authenticity and wants a real connection, let’s talk. Who knows? We might just be exactly what the other needs.

HMU if you're down for a good conversation and maybe ever and better connection.

1i7iaxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1i7iaxp/to_my_fellow_math_grad_students_do_you_always/,"To my fellow math grad students, do you always solve the exercises yourself and write model solutions for the classes you are TAing?","**Preamble:**

I am a second year PhD student (in Nordic countries) in math and as a requirement in my UNI I have to TA at least one class per both Autumn and Spring semesters -- *I know, not necessarily a lot but likely anything and everything from funding to terms of PhD studies are different between my area and, say, North America.*

I am currently doing my PhD at a different school than where I did my BSc+MSc studies. Twice so far I have had to TA a course I have not taken before. The overall ethos at my earlier institution between the students and pretty much all the TAing students (including grad students) was that a.) good students are expected to complete all the given work and to push their limits, b.) TAs are expected to know the material through and through to the point that they can solve all exercises of a class themselves and consequently provide helpful tips and hints of things that one might not immediately recognize if you were to just read given model solutions: after all, how can the graders demand a certain level from the students if they, the graders, cannot themselves adhere to the said level?

**Actual scenario:**

I was chatting today with an older PhD student in my program about this and that during our coffee break, and the topic of TAing came up. I mentioned that the current course I am TAing is a bit painful since I have to write model solutions from scratch to certain project problems, one being a proof that the Ramsey number R(3,4) is equal to 9 -- the courses I took offered minimal amount of graph theory during my earlier studies, so doing the proof from scratch does not seem that trivial -- and I do not really want to look up the proof from Internet, since I am expected to a.) give hints and tips to the students, b. ) how can I demand that they solve it if I cannot. The answer I received is the basin of this post: ""***You need to work smarter: just look at what submissions are actually made and grade with that. Writing models is almost a waste of time since there are often so many ways to prove a theorem or solve a problem.***""

**Question:**

So to my fellow math grad students, do you solve all the problems yourself in the courses you are TAing? Am I stupid or brainwashed to think along the line of the ethos of my earlier institution, which differs quite a bit from the advice I received?",1,1737571099.0,GradSchool,0,1.0,False

It doesn't matter how I grind it with my grinder, or if I use our at work grinder. When I brew coffee at home in one of my 15 coffee makers (I collect vintage makers) they always either overflow over the sides of the filter and get grounds in the coffee, on percolators the water barely runs through the grounds so I get a weak brew, or in some makers they go through a small overflow and just dump water down in my coffee. If I buy ground coffee from the store it does not do this. Only Starbucks coffee that I grind at home or at the store does it. Even on the coarsest setting. Has anyone else encountered this? I really like the taste of the Guatemala and the yukon, plus I get it for free. So I would love to use it but I just can't. I have to either use a French press, vacuum brewer, or a pour over to get a somewhat decent cup of coffee. And I would love for convenience to use my machines here, and to just be able to use them.  If I buy crappy Folgers from the store it works perfectly fine. Could there something wrong with both our grinder at work and my grinder at home?

job we both worked and went over and started a conversation. Went well and finished with her saying we should get a coffee sometime. Didn’t make concrete plans but she said the same thing after I approached her the second time for a chat.

Added her on social media and sent her a wee message asking if she wanted to go for a coffee one time and she said yes. Met up and it went well. Kept in contact and I asked her if she wanted to get a drink on the weekend but she said she was working the weekend so couldn’t. I took that as a rejection but kept in touch because we are on the same course and chatted a wee bit while we were on separate uni placements. 

Conversation stopped over Christmas so I assumed it was time to move on but two days back she came and found me at uni and had a wee chat. Messaged her a day later asking if she wanted to meet up again and she said she couldn’t the day I suggested but suggested another day. Messaged me the day before to confirm I was still up for it and I said of course.

Met up, had a really good time, conversation flowed great. Neither of us touched our phones the whole time. I tend to hyper analyse things so noticed her copying my body language a lot which I thought was good. We were laughing constantly, she was asking me questions, touching her hair a lot which I all took as good signs. The only thing I thought might not have been good was she said she needed to pee and went to the toilet. Spent about an hour and a half and then left saying it was nice to see each other and we would see each other again before going back on placement.

Everything seemed to go well but I went home sick with worry that it wasn’t going to go anywhere and I’m not sure why. Maybe because didn’t make concrete plans but we will see each other again anyway. I’m kind of still sick with worry and don’t really know where we stand. She obviously knows I like her as I’ve asked her out like three times but I worry she’s maybe just being overly kind but surely she would have just said no the third time if she didn’t want to meet up.

I don’t know where to go from here and I’m sick with worry and feel low on confidence which isn’t going to help. I felt good around her but this feeling just now is killing me. What do you suggest I do?

Having lots of relationship history with intimacy. Personally I don't have ANY intimacy experience on purpose and I don't want someone with LOTS of experience/relationship history. Also if you broke up recently that's also a big no for me. No one is an aid band duh.

I'm 6.1 - 185cm muscular build, (not too shredded) wide shoulders, white skin, black hair, eyes and beard ( I don't like having a long beard so I keep it short or shave ) . You can see me from the link below.

I'm from Turkey and my ethnicity is Caucasian.

My personality type is INFP-A , I don't believe horoscopes or to any religion.

I'm a Concept/2D Artist. I draw character designs, potraits, any stuff I like.

I'm loyal, empathetic, protective, dependable and love to share every thought I have with my partner and also expect the same thing.

I love melancholy in general, I have couple of sad song playlists on Spotify.

My main hobbies are drawing, powerlifting and gaming. I also do some other stuff like playing electric guitar sometimes but who cares.

I like getting and giving attention in equal terms.

I'm also an open book, I don't hide anything.

Also, I do care about physical attraction, I'm adding my photos first so you don't have to send a message if you don't find me attractive enough. In the end everyone has a different taste.

You? Want to come over for a drink? Not really, an online drink I suppose. Maybe we can talk about the above stuff. Some things I didn’t mention. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

I think we could be great friends if we give it a go.",0,1737570112.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,0.5,False

**THE BACKSTORY**

It was between 2012 -2014 and me and my friend were just looking through my dad's computer to find some sort of song to sing along to. There were like hundreds of songs that we considered ""way too popular"" so we kept searching. That's when we discovered this song. The song (from what I remember) was called ""Heart Space"" and for some reason, we found it a banger. We sorta got clingy to this song and even tried learning the lyrics! Well uh, it sorta failed because the singing is kinda ass, but we tried our best! Every time my friend (whom I'll call ""Alex"" hereafter) came over to my home, we just full on dashed to my dad's computer, went to the YouTube video and just forced our parents to listen to this damn ear sore and our own little dancing and singing. As a birthday gift, to make me happy, my dad managed to somehow download the audio and now we no longer had to go to YouTube every time just to listen to this one song. Like most people, we eventually grew out of it.

**NOW**

Me and Alex were just hanging around, doing whatever and then my mum called me and asked if I wanted to come over, and I said sure. After some more talking, she told me Alex could come over. And so we got over, spoke, had some tea and coffee and then I noticed my dad's computer and I asked my dad if me and Alex could use the computer for some nostalgia, like any sane person would. And then, would you believe it, we stumbled upon the file! After listening to it and having some flashbacks, I asked my parents this one question which I have no answer to today: Who made this song? They didn't know and we tried asking our other friends who sometimes also listened to this song and, of course, they didn't know. I took to Shazam but there was no luck. I tried ANY music identifying website to no avail.

**WHERE YOU MAY POSSIBLY COME IN**

Now, you could help me find this song! I'll provide the link to the full song and I'll give some lyrics to see if you could identify this song. I know it's unusual for a full song to be provided but I hope I get to find it!

Chorus Lyrics:

And now I've run into your Heart Space!

This proof, that held (?) me now is noise, it sets me free! (?)

[Breville Barista Express/Grinder that’s with it],"Hey all! I was gifted a used Breville barista express for Christmas by some very generous family members. It came pre dialed with a bag of lavazza beans they used to use. I’ve since ran out of those and grabbed a bag of beans from a local coffee roaster.  

I’ve got the settings on grind size 9. And for about a week it was making damn good espresso, like I was impressed with myself. The past 2 mornings, my pressure has shot way up and I’m not getting as much espresso out, it’s moving a LOT slower. 

My usual was 19g in, getting 39-48 grams out for a double shot. I have not weighed it which I need to do I guess but I’m getting MAYBE 30 grams out now probably less. I even adjusted grind size back to 10 and that did not help. 

I’m confused because with the new bag of beans from the local roaster, it took 2 mornings to dial in then I had 6-8 days of impressively good espresso for a beginner, imo. lol. And now it’s too much pressure and not getting enough espresso out. What are my options? Thanks for any and all advice like I said I’m a real beginner ",1,1737569767.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

If drinking, be careful cause snow lacks electrolytes. You can add some salt. But a cup of coffee or something won’t kill you. Boil it for several minutes too. 

Also keep in mind that when pipes unfreeze they can be busted. Which means you could still have no water. And I’m not gonna rely on stores having water, so I’m personally gonna melt down a big pot of snow before it melts/gets too dirty

I studied German hard before coming here and try to put myself out there, but I’ll admit my social life has definitely taken a hit

I started going to German classes a couple weeks ago, I’m the youngest in the group, 25F, most are in mid 30s or 40s. At the end of class we all spoke together, but one guy didn’t speak to me and instead just lingered close, walked closely behind me as I was going down the stairs, everyone else had gone ahead. 

When I was waiting for my ride he approached and asked me if I needed a ride, I thanked him but said they were already on their way, and he could drop me next time, as he seemed friendly. 

We exchanged numbers and went out for coffee, and while he seemed nice enough and intelligent, I didn’t appreciate how he was trashing my country, that he would never go back, etc. For context he’s Lithuanian. I tried to point out that every country has its pros and cons, but he only wanted to talk about the negative. He also talked about himself pretty much the whole time. 

For added context, I asked him if he knew where to buy the textbooks we needed for class as I couldn’t find them online, and he offered to get them for me, and asked if I wanted to grab and a drink and food together too. We went halves on everything- and after buying the textbooks, he asked me to send him the money for it afterwards, which I did.

None of these are bad things, of course I’m happy to pay my own, as I’m an adult. But I’m not attracted to men like this. I like to spoil, and be spoilt, so I felt no romantic attraction.

Anywho from then he started dropping me home after class, brought me a tourist guide book as I said I was struggling to find clubs, and we made plans to go hiking this Sunday. 
Randomly yesterday, he asked me if I was interested in going to his house one evening to study the textbook together. 

For added context, he owns his house and it has a pool and sauna. Also asked if I wanted to go swimming with him afterwards, and ‘wasn’t pushing anything just a friendly idea.’

I said I wasn’t comfortable going to his house yet, and also as I don’t have a car and taxis aren’t really a thing in this area, I’d be relying on him to take me home.

After I said that, he texted me that he would no longer be able to take me home after class, and that he’s made other plans this Sunday. Makes no difference to me, I can easily get home from class

I just thought it was funny and also petty. Since then I’ve made other plans, but I’m wondering if he actually had friendly intentions and was disappointed I said no, or if his intent wasn’t friendly at all and he’s pissed I wasn’t interested.

1i7hpv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Quittingfeelfree/comments/1i7hpv8/day_4_ct_feeling_free/,Day 4 CT - feeling free!,"HUGE turning day for me. I feel almost back to normal. I’m going to do my best to eat more today. My energy levels are better, my body feels better and I finally got a little sleep. 

Below is the longer version of how the last few days went and tips for the sleepless nights for those that are interested or feeling hopeless. You are not alone and if you are thinking of going CT here is your sign. You can totally do this. My husband and I are feeling so much better. That’s 2 people that were deep in addiction at this time last week and are recovering and doing so much better by day 4! The odds are in your favor!

Details:
I posted an update saying day 2 CT and my husband and my story with FF. We used for 1.5 years and quit this last Sunday. We started slight tapering day 1 - only 1 each and a little powder but decided to just take it head on by day 2. 

Day 3 (yesterday) was my hardest day mentally. We had a totally booked day between being back at our remote jobs, 2 appointments and errands. We were going from 7am-11pm. I had been taking FF before work meetings and calls for 1.5 years so I started to panic when I showed up to work sober. I was crying all day and really in a bad spot mentally. I just put one foot in front of the other and just kept telling myself a product that does this to me is not normal. I’m normally a confident, calm person. I also had watery stool all day and was just dragging. We didn’t sleep at all for 2 nights in a row. My husband had a small stretch and was in a better space for sure.

That night I finally got a few stretches of sleep. We used gabapentin (RLS medication, it runs in my husbands family so he easily got a prescription and we took a small dose. We will be trying tonight not to take it at all) to help with the restless legs and that did wonders for us. We still had a little bit of restless legs overnight but we finally got a couple hour stretches. 

I woke up today on day 4 and I’m a new person. I got up and did my morning routine. I was even able to wait to drink coffee till I’d been up for 2 hours. I’m trying to delay putting anything but supplements, water and electrolytes for the first 2 hours of the day to break the habit of using something to get up. Grabbing a blue bottle was the first thing I did when my eyes opened everyday for 1.5 years. 

Sleep is so important for your mental health so if you are feeling depressed, anxious, panicky, whatever during the first week of cutting cold turkey… remind yourself that this isn’t forever. And when you finally get some sleep you WILL feel so much better and stronger mentally. If you wake up and want to grab a blue bottle because you are feeling this during your detox. Please don’t cave. Remind yourself it’s just the sleepless brain talking and it’s not real. 

What helps us at bed time: magnesium lotion on our legs and arms. High dose of Magnesium glycinate, magnesium l-threonate, unisom, ibuprofen, acid kicking minerals from alkamind (basically like what you find in electrolytes), iron, vitamin C, turmeric and some mood supplements like Cortisol Calm from pure encapsulations for the bedtime anxiety.  gabapentin if you can.

We found out that RLS comes from iron deficiency a lot of the time. If you look into kratom , I’m pretty sure it has high iron. That might be why the withdrawal is so bad. Since supplementing with iron, it’s helped a lot with body relaxation. We had steak for dinner too. 

Getting outside in the sun and hearing the birds each morning literally has brought tears to my eyes. It’s so beautiful and I can’t believe how numb I was. Praying to God has helped guide me. The tougher times are his test to see if I will cave that was what day 3 was for me. I feel like he rewarded me some sleep last night for not.

From traditional asset classes to cutting-edge digital assets, here’s an in-depth look at what drives the trading strategies of these financial giants.

**1. Foreign Exchange (Forex) Trading**

Forex trading remains a cornerstone of major banks’ operations. Institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Citi, and Deutsche Bank dominate the forex market, executing trades on behalf of clients and engaging in proprietary trading.

* High-frequency trading (HFT): Banks use sophisticated algorithms to profit from minute price changes in currency pairs.
* Emerging markets: Many banks focus on trading currencies from developing economies, where volatility creates significant profit opportunities.
* Hedging strategies: Banks assist multinational corporations in hedging against currency risks, while also managing their own exposures.

**2. Equities and Derivatives**

Banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley excel in equity and derivative trading.

* Equity trading: Banks profit from facilitating trades for institutional clients and retail investors, as well as proprietary trading in equities.
* Derivatives: These instruments, including options, futures, and swaps, allow banks to hedge risks and speculate on market movements.
* Market-making: Banks provide liquidity by buying and selling securities, profiting from the bid-ask spread.

**3. Commodities Trading**

Commodities, such as oil, gold, and agricultural products, are another key area for banks.

* Energy markets: Banks trade oil, natural gas, and renewable energy credits, often using futures and options to manage risk or speculate on price changes.
* Metals: Gold and silver are popular as hedges against inflation, while rare metals like lithium attract interest due to the demand from the tech industry.
* Agricultural commodities: Banks trade products like wheat, corn, and coffee, capitalizing on price swings driven by weather or geopolitical events.

**4. Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC)**

The FICC segment is a significant revenue driver for banks, encompassing bonds, forex, and commodities trading.

* Government bonds: Institutions trade U.S. Treasuries, German Bunds, and other sovereign debt, often as part of macroeconomic strategies.
* Corporate bonds: High-yield and investment-grade bonds offer opportunities for trading and structuring complex credit products.
* Interest rate swaps: These allow banks to manage exposure to changing interest rates and help clients hedge against rate volatility.

**5. Digital Assets and Cryptocurrencies**

While traditionally cautious, many banks are now entering the digital asset space.

* Cryptocurrency trading: Banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have begun offering crypto trading desks to institutional clients.
* Blockchain technology: Many banks invest in blockchain for efficiency in settlement and transaction processing.
* Stablecoins and CBDCs: Trading in stablecoins and involvement in Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) projects are gaining traction.

**6. Risk Arbitrage and Event-Driven Strategies**

Banks often capitalize on market inefficiencies caused by specific events.

* Mergers and acquisitions (M&A): Banks trade stocks of companies involved in M&A deals, betting on the spread between the offer price and the current market price.
* Earnings reports: Trading on anticipated or actual results of quarterly earnings can generate significant profits.

**7. Technology-Driven Trading**

Banks heavily invest in advanced technologies to stay competitive in trading.

* Artificial intelligence (AI): AI is used for predictive analytics, risk management, and automating trading strategies.
* Machine learning models: These models help identify patterns and trends in massive datasets, enabling banks to make better trading decisions.
* Quantum computing: Though still nascent, quantum computing is being explored for complex simulations and optimizing trading strategies.

**8. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Investments**

The growing emphasis on sustainable investing has pushed banks to focus on ESG-related trading.

* Carbon credits: Banks trade carbon offsets as part of global efforts to combat climate change.
* Green bonds: Issuing and trading bonds linked to renewable energy and sustainability projects.
* Sustainable ETFs: Banks offer and trade exchange-traded funds focusing on ESG-compliant companies.

**9. How Banks Use TradingView**

[TradingView](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/) has become an essential tool for banks and traders alike, providing advanced charting features and data visualization. While individual traders use the platform for insights, major banks integrate it to enhance their trading operations.

* Market analysis: Banks utilize TradingView’s comprehensive charting tools to analyze market trends, identify patterns, and inform trading strategies.
* Collaboration: The platform’s ability to share ideas and charts fosters communication between bank analysts and traders.
* Custom indicators: Banks develop proprietary indicators on TradingView’s Pine Script to gain unique insights into the market.
* Integration with technology: TradingView APIs allow banks to integrate real-time data into their broader trading platforms, streamlining decision-making.

Major banks are central to the global trading ecosystem, utilizing their scale and expertise to influence markets. They operate across diverse asset classes, from forex and equities to digital assets and ESG investments, adapting to emerging trends and technological advancements.
