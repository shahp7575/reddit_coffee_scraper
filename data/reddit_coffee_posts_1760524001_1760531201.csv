1o79drc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1o79drc/unresolved_eye_problem_mystery_for_over_18_months/,Unresolved Eye Problem - Mystery for over 18 Months,"This story is about my eyes - both of them.
The problem started last year, around March or April. Over 18 months ago.

My eyes began to get tired very quickly. I couldn‚Äôt keep them open; they would start blinking uncontrollably within a few seconds. Then they became red, painful, and irritated. Small white-yellowish pieces started to build up during the day, and I had to clean them several times daily.

Sometimes, when my eyes were extremely tired and painful, mucus would build up overnight, drying and closing my eyes shut.

The first time I noticed something was seriously wrong was when I couldn‚Äôt even focus or look people in the eyes while talking ‚Äî my eyes would suddenly get tired, start blinking uncontrollably, and my eyelids just wanted to close.

Over time, I also realized that I often unconsciously strain my eyes, eyelids, and the muscles around them, almost as if I‚Äôm constantly tensing them without noticing. I feel that this tension also contributes to my eyes getting tired very quickly.

It got worse. During regular work meetings with 10‚Äì15 people in a room and a projection board, I couldn‚Äôt concentrate. It was especially bad when several people spoke at once, and I tried to focus on listening.

One thing worth mentioning is that during those meetings, the lights in the room were dimmed ‚Äî and that made things even worse for me.

Eventually, it got so bad that I couldn‚Äôt drive my car anymore ‚Äî not even as a passenger. I tried using public transport, but the same thing happened: my eyes got tired, and I couldn‚Äôt focus on what was in front of me.

Going to the cinema was out of the question. Once the lights went down, my eyes would hurt so badly that I had to leave before the movie even started. Watching TV at home is sometimes impossible too ‚Äî especially at night when the room is darker. It‚Äôs easier during the day with natural light.

One particularly bad episode was when a friend came to visit. He sat with his back to a large window, and I faced him and the window. It was a rainy, cloudy day, so the room wasn‚Äôt bright. I talked to him for maybe an hour without a break, trying to look him in the eyes. But I felt as if the dim light and daylight coming through the window confused my eyes ‚Äî they didn‚Äôt seem to know where to focus.

After that, my eyes were very sore, red, swollen, and inflamed. You can see in the picture how bad they were.
Link to pictures: https://imgur.com/a/bad-eye-problem-DYh8scw

Funny thing is, Ice Cubes kind of relexed the eye. I did cool the both eyes for 5-10 minutes. Maybe it only felt good, but I think it really relaxed the eyes and the eyelids.

Another new  trigger that I found out just a couple of days back was looking through my door peephole ‚Äî closing one eye and straining the other to see who was outside on the stairs. After only five seconds, my eyes started to feel extremely tired, and I immediately knew I‚Äôd made a mistake because it would take hours for them to recover. Even my girlfriend noticed and said, ‚ÄúWhat triggered your eyes again? You‚Äôre blinking so fast!‚Äù

I also went to an optician for a vision check ‚Äî I see perfectly well and don‚Äôt need to wear glasses.

As I mentioned, it all started between March and April 2024. During that time ‚Äî and in the months before ‚Äî I was under a lot of stress at work. I was constantly thinking about work, often bringing it home, working overtime, and even early in the mornings before work.

I had migraines almost every day and took a lot of Thomapyrin INTENSIVE (which contains 250 mg acetylsalicylic acid, 250 mg paracetamol, and 50 mg caffeine) ‚Äî sometimes even two or three tablets a day. I also took ibuprofen, usually on an empty stomach ‚Äî about 90% of the time.

In addition to that, light often triggers my migraines or eye pain. Sometimes, when I wake up in the morning, even the small light from my phone when the alarm goes off can cause sharp pain ‚Äî usually behind one eye ‚Äî that lasts the entire day. It eventually goes away, but not always. Bright sunlight can also trigger it; when I step outside into intense light, my eyes suddenly hurt and need a few minutes to adjust.

I smoked cigarettes, drank a lot of coffee, and often had Red Bull Zero on an empty stomach. During that period, I had serious stomach issues ‚Äî constant bloating, cramps, and pain. Almost every meal caused diarrhea, and my stool was in bad condition. Sometimes I stopped eating at work altogether because of it, only eating after coming home ‚Äî usually around 6 or 9 p.m., depending on my shift. My diet at that time was also very poor.

I believe all of that was the result of a poor lifestyle and being too focused on my career.

Last November, I went to a gastroenterologist and was diagnosed with IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and mild inflammation in my intestines. A year has passed since then, and my stomach has improved a lot ‚Äî it‚Äôs not perfect yet, but much better than before.

However, my eyes still don‚Äôt work like they used to.
For example, just yesterday, I stayed home all day, then went for a short 5-minute drive as a passenger to buy groceries in the evening ‚Äî it was dark outside, and my eyes quickly became tired, red, and painful again.

It‚Äôs also important to mention that my work was always stressful. I had to lead a team, handle customer complaints and escalations, deal with economic pressure, react quickly, attend meetings, and ensure my coworkers were happy ‚Äî all while dealing with criticism from my supervisor. Despite everything, I actually liked my job.

But one major issue was the lighting. The LED lights in the office were far too bright, and from day one, I started getting migraines and headaches. I even tried blue-light filter glasses, but they didn‚Äôt help much. The air quality in the office was also terrible ‚Äî suffocating, with too little oxygen. Even customers complained about it.

Now for the second important part:
I have no issues reading a book or doing things at home, like cooking or cleaning. Walking or riding my bike is also fine ‚Äî I never have eye problems then.

Using my phone or laptop for a long time doesn‚Äôt affect my eyes either.

One trick I discovered: when I‚Äôm in a car or on public transport, if I focus on a still point ‚Äî like the floor, ceiling, or my phone ‚Äî my eyes stay relaxed and normal. But if I look outside and try to focus on the moving scenery or concentrate too hard on the road, my eyes get triggered badly.

The same happens in darker rooms or crowded places. I even tried attending a music concert once, and my eyes hurt badly afterward.

Finally, I don‚Äôt take any medication now. Unfortunately, no eye doctor has been able to help me. They said I only have mild dry eyes, which is almost normal.

I use Celluvisc 1% eye drops (containing carmellose sodium) and a vitamin A ointment at night before sleep.

The supplements I take daily (since being diagnosed with IBS) are:

Vitamin C and Iron

Vitamin B complex

Zinc

Magnesium Glycinat

Omega-3 (650 mg EPA and 440 mg DHA)

Vitamin A (1000 ¬µg daily)

Vitamin K2 (200 ¬µg daily)

Vitamin D3 (50‚Äì125 ¬µg daily)

Electrolytes

Probiotics for IBS and Fiber like  Indian Psyllium Husks

L-Glutamine and Collagen

I usually sleep between 6‚Äì8 hours per night. I don't smoke cigarettes over 16 months, don't do drugs. And drink no alcohol.

Any help or advice would mean a lot. I‚Äôve been dealing with this for over 18 months now, and I just want to do the things I love again and enjoy my life to the fullest.

Thank you!

1o79c3w,https://i.redd.it/e6btk103p9vf1.jpeg,CHOP SUEY (1929 oil on canvas) by Edward Hopper Discovering a masterpiece of urban loneliness,"Hey everyone in r/Artforeveryone_! 
Today, We want to share a masterpiece from American realist painter Edward Hopper: his 1929 oil on canvas work titled Chop Suey. If you're into art that captures the quiet, introspective side of city life, this one's a gem. I'll break it down with a bit of background, description, and some thoughts on why it still resonates today. Feel free to chime in with your interpretations!

A Quick Intro to Edward Hopper:
Edward Hopper (1882‚Äì1967) was a key figure in American modernism, known for his depictions of everyday urban scenes that often evoke feelings of isolation and melancholy. He wasn't about grand narratives or action-packed stories; instead, his paintings are like frozen moments in time, saturated with subtle emotion. Hopper drew inspiration from New York City life, where he lived and worked, and his style blends realism with a touch of symbolism. Fun fact: Chop Suey fetched a whopping $92 million at auction in 2018, setting a record for his work!

What's in the Painting?
Set in a brightly lit Chinese restaurant (a ""chop suey"" joint, popular in early 20th-century America), the scene focuses on two women seated at a small table by a window. The woman facing us has a thoughtful, almost distant expression, her face bathed in sunlight streaming through the glass. Her companion, seen in profile, leans slightly forward as if in conversation, but there's a sense of disconnection like they're together but worlds apart. In the background, you can spot a man and woman at another table, partially obscured, adding to the layered feel of the space.

The composition is classic Hopper: strong geometric lines from the tables, chairs, and signage (including a glowing ""Suey"" sign outside), contrasted with soft, natural light. The colors are muted yet vibrant ‚Äì greens, pinks, and yellows that give the restaurant a cozy but eerie vibe. It's not just a snapshot; it's a commentary on modern life in the 1920s, when women were gaining more independence but still navigating societal shifts.

Why It Matters: Themes and Analysis
At its core, Chop Suey explores themes of loneliness in the midst of company, a hallmark of Hopper's oeuvre. Even though the women are chatting over tea or coffee, their body language suggests emotional distance, one stares off, the other seems absorbed in her own thoughts. This reflects the alienation of urban existence during the Jazz Age, where bustling cities could feel profoundly isolating.9e0355 Hopper himself said he was interested in ""general human values,"" using art to frame the quiet forces shaping people's lives.

It's also a nod to the changing role of women in the 1920s. These aren't traditional domestic figures; they're out in public, dressed in modern cloche hats and enjoying a meal in a trendy spot. Yet, Hopper subtly critiques the fragmentation of identity in modern society partial views of people, like the man's back or a profile, emphasize how we only see snippets of others' lives.The restaurant setting adds cultural flavor too; chop suey was an Americanized Chinese dish, symbolizing the blending (and sometimes superficiality) of cultures in big cities.

Where to See It and Final Thoughts? 
Chop Suey is part of a private collection now, but high-res images are easy to find online (check out the Whitney Museum's site or Wikipedia for starters).

1o79agr,https://i.redd.it/bdz28njio9vf1.jpeg,BAHA! LOADS of the BEST Chengdu beers in Shanghai event GOSHDARN!,"HEYO!

Ok so I‚Äôm organizing another thing but with Junto a craft beer bar in JingAn. I‚Äôll preface a bit; just now the beer industry is kind of sucking a bit in China cause it‚Äôs hitting a cultural zeitgeist moment, is becoming over invested, too many new beer bars opening without a focus on being very good, too many beer brands starting without a focus on being very good. The same thing happened with coffee before, and the end result is AWESOME for the consumer; everywhere you go you can get a decent coffee, only quality stuff can survive etc. 



But currently we‚Äôre right in that gold rush moment and theirs loads of shit beer and loads of shit bars. Just far too much noise.



So again, to try and bring a bit of reprieve from that, I‚Äôve used any clout I have to get only the best beers from the best breweries in Chengdu all in Shanghai at the same time. It has been a task to get everyone on board but I can categorically guarantee you won‚Äôt get any shit beer, it‚Äôs all only stuff I genuinely think is good beer.



Basically you get free flow, potentially for 5 hours if you arrive at 5pm, for 188 rmb if you pre buy a ticket. Or 228 rmb if you buy on the day. It‚Äôs a pretty sick deal.



I‚Äôm also organising some other stuff, a tea kungfu guy, chengdu mahjong, other cool bits and pieces I can get tacked on before it starts.



So yeh! Come hang! It‚Äôll be fun! I want to do more stuff like this in Shanghai!

So this time, I stayed downtown for 4 days instead of the usual $500+/night resort in the hotel zone. And I ended up loving it.

Downtown Cancun is full of hidden gems: cozy caf√©s, hip spots on Nader Street, and lively food stalls. I felt super safe even a bit later at night. I love all the graffiti arts here. 

My absolute favorite spot was this tiny tacos y consom√© de res stand near ‚ÄúLa Cevicher√≠a‚Äù (the big roundabout with sea creature statues üòÇ hilarious that the locals call it ceviche ) The broth is so damn addictive. I walked 20 minutes there every single night just for it and sweat my butt off eating at the lil stand. 

Other food favorites:
- El Socio Naiz Taquer√≠a 
- Paragallos Seafood & Tacos 
- Le Waah Bakery 
- Tomizen Ramen Bar
- Onesto Caf√© 
- Amatista Coffee Bar ‚Äì witchy crystal vibes + ‚Äúcrystal ball‚Äù lemonades ‚ú®

My other absolute highlight was Parque Ecol√≥gico Kabah. It‚Äôs this unassuming park in the middle of the city ‚Äî but inside, you‚Äôll find turtles, birds, and entire packs of coatis (raccoon cousins). Locals even leave out fruit for them.

Local Culture & Sights
- Museo Maya de Canc√∫n + Zona Arqueol√≥gica de San Miguelito ‚Äì small but beautiful combo
- El Rey Ruins ‚Äì windy, quiet, and almost no tourists
- Bohemian Square ‚Äì Daniel Popper statues, like very tulum 
- Mercado 28 ‚Äì classic souvenir stop; haggle to at least one-third of the price
- Mercado Negro ‚Äì ramen, tacos, seafood, and local favorites

Other tips about getting around 
- Collectivo vans are the local buses ‚Äî small white van. Look sketch but reliable. flag them down anywhere, they go as far as Playa del Carmen
- ADO buses (big red ones) are your best bet for Xel-Ha, Xcaret, or Tulum
- Uber is cheap and reliable within Cancun (but cant get it from the airport).
- Taxis from the airport are quite pricey esp going to hotel zone ($80‚Äì100 USD) Book a transfer in advance (~$35‚Äì40 USD / 650 pesos) and meet them at Departures, not Arrivals

Without the big luxury hotel insulation, cancun felt like its full of warmth and rhthms. Fell in love with the place all over again. ",4,1760530135.0,travel,1,0.83,False

So I 24 decided to ask him 26 out again

I asked him the Friday night if he wants to go out and he asked if it's a date and we agreed it's a date. On 4th oct we went for ice cream and coffee my idea then he decided we go for lunch and walk around the mall aswell as he had to look for something for his mother the date was fun and we hugged as greatings and agreed we should do it again.

We texted about our relationships future afterwards and agreed we can do casual dating more friends with benefits though

Now I want to go out again I figured I'll ask as he is shy and might not think I want to go now what I want to know are suggestions what we can do?

I figured I'll ask Friday if he has weekend plans and if not then I'll ask if he wants go out again if not busy and I'll ask what he wants to do and suggest something like coffee and ice cream

This thing promises big coverage, even spreading, and an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù assembly though, spoiler alert: ‚Äúeasy‚Äù is doing some heavy lifting there.

After a few weekends of use, a couple of hiccups, and some DIY tweaks, here‚Äôs the good, the bad, and the ‚Äúeh, close enough‚Äù of owning this spreader.

# First Impressions

At first glance, this spreader looks like a serious piece of lawn gear. solid frame, big hopper, heavy-duty tires. It‚Äôs built for folks who have **medium to large lawns (up to half an acre)** and want to tow behind a **tractor, ATV, or zero-turn mower**.

It‚Äôs rated for **130 pounds of material** and about **25,000 sq. ft. of coverage**, which sounds impressive and honestly, it mostly delivers.



# Key Features 

Here‚Äôs the quick rundown of what the Agri-Fab spreader packs:

* **130-pound hopper capacity** (think: one big bag of fertilizer, maybe two if you‚Äôre lucky)
* **10‚Äì12 ft spread width**, which is perfect for large areas
* **Durable poly hopper** that resists corrosion
* **Enclosed gearbox,** keeps the gears safe from dirt and debris
* **13"" pneumatic tires** that roll well on uneven ground
* **Universal hitch** that works with most tractors and ATVs
* **Steel rod flow control** for adjusting how much material comes out
* **Heavy-duty 1‚Äù tubular frame**
* **On/off control you can reach from your seat** (unless you‚Äôre using a zero-turn‚Ä¶ more on that later)



# Assembly: Bring Snacks and Patience

Let‚Äôs just say this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äútake it out of the box and go‚Äù kind of setup.

The **instructions are okay**, not great. The quick-start guide helps, but there are a few steps that had me scratching my head. (One wrong bolt placement and you‚Äôll be redoing half of it.)

# My Experience:

* The **gearbox alignment** took a few tries. I may or may not have muttered words unfit for print.
* The **hopper trapdoor** didn‚Äôt close fully at first. I had to trim a metal plate by ¬º inch to fix it (thanks to a helpful YouTube comment section tip).
* **Some parts need force,** a hammer and pliers are your best friends here.
* **Calibration** was fiddly but important. I had to tweak the ferrule alignment to get even flow from both sides.

T**otal Time:** Around 1.5 hours, with one coffee break and a short existential crisis.

**Pro Tip:**  
Double-check every bolt hole *before* tightening, and keep that hammer handy. Once it‚Äôs all together, it‚Äôs pretty sturdy.

# In Use: Smooth Operator (Mostly)

Once you‚Äôve survived assembly, the Agri-Fab spreader is genuinely enjoyable to use.

# Spreading Performance

At about **3 mph**, the spread is even and smooth. I used it for both fertilizer and grass seed, both came out consistently as long as I kept my speed steady.  
The **flow control** lets you fine-tune the rate from the seat (settings 1‚Äì6), which is great‚Ä¶ unless you‚Äôre using a zero-turn mower. Then you‚Äôll need to stretch like you‚Äôre doing yoga just to reach it.

It spreads in a nice **wide arc (10‚Äì12 ft)**, but that also means you need to be careful near driveways or flower beds, overspreading is easy to do if you‚Äôre not paying attention.



# Towing & Handling

The **universal hitch** works with most tractors and ATVs. I hooked mine up to a **John Deere lawn tractor**, and it fit perfectly.

That said, a few people (and I can confirm this) noticed that the **spreader tilts downward** depending on hitch height. I ended up using a short **chain to level it out**, which made a big difference.

The **pneumatic tires** handle bumps well and give it a smooth, stable roll even over uneven spots. No punctures or weird wobbles so far.



# Capacity & Reality Check

On paper, it holds **130 lbs**, but in real life, that‚Äôs a tight squeeze. With **100 lbs of fertilizer**, it‚Äôs already nearly full.

Not a dealbreaker, just plan for a mid-task refill if you‚Äôve got a large property.



# Durability & Maintenance

Overall, the construction feels solid, though it‚Äôs not indestructible. The **poly hopper** resists rust and corrosion well, and the **metal frame** can handle plenty of weight. Just be careful not to overtighten bolts, the tubing can bend a little under too much torque.

# Things to Watch:

* A few users reported **gearbox failures** after a couple uses. I haven‚Äôt had this happen, but it seems related to improper assembly or rough towing.
* The **gearbox enclosure** is a nice touch and makes cleaning much easier.
* Definitely **store it indoors**  leaving it out in the rain is asking for rust.



# Everyday Maintenance Tips

* Empty the hopper after each use (fertilizer eats metal for breakfast).
* Check for loose nuts before every job.
* Recalibrate the flow control occasionally, it drifts a bit over time.



# Pros and Cons (Real Talk)

**What I Love:**

* Big capacity = fewer refills
* Spreads evenly and quickly once calibrated
* Smooth ride with those chunky tires
* Feels solid once assembled
* Gearbox protection is a big plus
* Works with most tractors and ATVs

**What I Don‚Äôt Love:**

* Assembly isn‚Äôt beginner-friendly
* Instructions could be clearer
* Flow control handle is awkward on zero-turns
* Might tilt if your hitch is too low
* Doesn‚Äôt *really* hold a full 130 lbs

I‚Äôve used this for:

* **Spring overseeding** (fescue and rye mix ‚Äî worked great)
* **Summer fertilizer applications**
* **Fall lime spreading**

Basically, it‚Äôs a solid all-rounder for anything granular, just not ideal for super precise boundary work. (If you want laser precision near flower beds, a **drop spreader** is better.)



# Compared to Others

I looked at the **Brinly** and **Craftsman** models before buying. The Agri-Fab‚Äôs **bigger hopper** and **enclosed gearbox** won me over. The Brinly might be slightly easier to assemble, but this one feels sturdier overall once you get it right.",1,1760529893.0,UsefulThingsOnly,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve had crippling social anxiety for most of my life and after the plague shutdowns, it only seems to have gotten worse. I‚Äôm often unable to leave the house for doctors appointments and such without a day or two of mental preparation. Due to LGBTQ rights swiftly going down the toilet in my home country, my wife and I had to flee to Spain in March on short notice without knowing the language. I am now in therapy and on anxiety medication.

Long story short, I need to learn Spanish and run errands like getting groceries while my wife works full time as a digital nomad, but that‚Äôs hard to do when I can barely leave the house. (It was even worse in my home country.) Today I was brave and went to the local mall on a whim to get a coffee & donut from the grocery store and do some art on my tablet at one of the tables in the center of the mall, but it turns out that the tables were for a nearby cafe. The owner was annoyed, so I put away my groceries and panic ordered some coffees. (Owner is happy now and even brought me some potato crisps. Crisis averted.) Now I am sitting here chugging coffees and trying to calm down. It‚Äôs such a trivial thing, but now I‚Äôve got the anxiety equivalent of someone who farted loudly during a wedding.

Any tips for getting myself out of the house? How do I deal with the stress of social interactions? Is there a Discord or something for autistics to ask questions and quickly crowd source our knowledge about social norms? The language barrier doesn‚Äôt bother me as much (it seems to give me an excuse for not knowing social norms), but something like not knowing where to sit in a mall makes me want to crawl out of my skin.

I'm doing a Wellness+ Strength training program ATM.  I lost 65 lbs last year and that included like...all? my muscles.  I felt weak as all get out and I know I lost a TON of lean mass in that year.  So I started out on the Wellness+ Strength Program after about a month or so of work doing various routines (kind of a get to know the machine period). I was doing 3x/week but set wellness+ to do M-F training (I train before work, and I WFH).

I'm in the Prep Phase, i.e. Endurance.  Lots of reps, light(ish) weight, many sets, many giant sets.  It's actually been a challenge.  I'm getting through it, feels great some days, feels almost too much other days.  It's definitely going well. Last Friday, I woke up after a particular hard leg day and had ZERO energy.  I did the workout, but it was a massive struggle to just get through.

I woke up on Monday, and wasn't feeling it.  I sat in my office, eating my breakfast, checking email, drinking coffee, staring at the machine thinking, ""I hate you today. I don't want to do this today. I don't care if it's just arms, I'm not into it.  I'm getting burned out."" So, I log into work and dick around doing paperwork and stuff for a bit.

After delaying for a couple of hours, I said, ""fuck it, I'll half-ass it. At least I'll be doing something.""  I turn on a meeting recording I missed last week and start up the machine.  Wellness+ gives me this message (paraphrased) for my workout:

""Good morning, since next week is a big strength focused week, we're going to deload this week.  All sets will be reduced by 25-50%.""

PRAISE BUFFLORE! 

I couldn't have taken a full workout this week.  I'm tired boss, dog tired...",0,1760529365.0,SpeedianceCommunity,0,0.5,False

1o78x61,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o78x61/do_i_send_it_or_just_leave/,Do i send it or just leave,"A holiday romance i met in May turned into a situationship recently, we‚Äôve spoke every day since we met and slept together on holiday and sent many relationship/couples tiktoks (she would send shit like a gig and the love of my life, couple goals etc). Yet she was always hot and cold and too busy for plans. But she did eventually meet me, i stayed at hers and we slept together. This was 3 weeks ago (after trying since july to meet), then we agreed to meet just a couple weeks after but I was ill. Since then she pulled away big time, i was down in her city this weekend but she avoided plans then didn‚Äôt reply the entire saturday night. She ended it over text citing distance (3 hours travel but i said id do all the travelling, i enjoy trips to her city regularly anyway) busyness, her anxiety and her not being ready for a relationship/needing to focus on herself. I told her i don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs any of that tbh cause it was going so well 7 days ago and we could‚Äôve met 3 times in the last month if she tried, and it seems silly to drop 5 months over something that didn‚Äôt seem a big issue. She also downplayed the entire thing cause we only met once, despite me trying constantly to meet, the couples tiktoks, late phone calls, saying she was my future gf, sending wedding rings, photos of her for my background, and said we never really chatted about how this work out anyway. I left her on opened on Monday, our 140 day streak died, she‚Äôs removed me from her story and turned her location off for me. Will this help sending this? I don‚Äôt think i want to fix things now i just want to let her know what i‚Äôve felt, or is silence the best option?

EDIT: we agreed to be exclusive in september when i went to see her

needed to clear my head and think about this and tbh i‚Äôve been in two minds to even reply, but what i will say is this.. yes, you did avoid me this weekend let‚Äôs just be real. you didn‚Äôt get back to me about coffee which takes 20 mins together and then blanked me the entire night, that isn‚Äôt busyness you‚Äôd very clearly made your mind up as you‚Äôd been short all week anyway - if you wanted to make time you would, because i did. ive realised i should‚Äôve ended this weeks ago - you know this has been one sided, i make an effort to arrange plans consistently, you consistently give me ‚Äúmaybe, depends what i‚Äôm doing, i‚Äôll see‚Äù. yet you‚Äôve pretended to be my future girlfriend for 2 months with the late night calls falling asleep, the tiktoks and reels, all the chats, the plans you‚Äôd send - so there‚Äôs no point claiming you‚Äôre saying this now to avoid leading me on - too late. i‚Äôm not stupid, this has nothing to do with distance, busyness or anxiety. its shit to end like this but i‚Äôm not chasing someone who can‚Äôt be truthful and isn‚Äôt arsed anyway",1,1760529317.0,BreakUps,5,1.0,False

To start, i had a baby about a year and a half ago. Prior to baby, I did not have this issue. While baby was fully breastfeeding, I did not have this issue. When babe was about 6 months my evening milk supply started to dindle. Somewhere between last November and January my abdominal bloating started in the morning. I was not consistent at first and I also had a substantial amount of back pain d/t being large chested and a chunky monkey baby, with a poor bra. In January I got fitted for a proper bra and the extra support has been very helpful with the upper back pain. 

Initially I would wake up bloated, yet my upper abdominal was rock hard and I could not relax it. The pain tends to remain in the upper quadrants where it is tight. 
I am a 30F. No other major medical issues. No allergies other than DHE. We eat healthy think beef farm, chickens, pigs, deer meat. I preserve all of our garden through canning/freezing/dehydrating. I make about 75% of our own bread. We drink milk. I typically make our own dressings and dips with eggs/oil. I use tallow for cooking. I use pure sucralose to make a coffee sweetner (just in water). 

I drink 3-4 cups of coffee a day (turned into ice coffee). 
I tend to a substantial amount of water/lemon water.
I personally find that I crave salt - I could put gobs of butter on noodles and that sounds delicious. I find if I eat more salt on my eggs, I drink more fluid. I haven't tested increasing my salt intake to see if it helps with bloating for a consistent week but that may what I try this week.

I am uncretian where to start. When I brought it up with my doctor he just did a blood panel where everything was regular. 
I have tried omitting a few things or adding a few things, I know consistency is key. 

Chia seeds & Lemon water in the morning help a bit.
Supplemented with Beef Liver pills. Seemed to help a bit. 
I have tried eating no dairy to eating extra, ironically eating extra and I didn't bloated in the morning. 

I have been stuck around the exact same weight as well. 

Any ideas how being post partum could affect me and how to change it? Thinking of having another baby but worried about how the pain is right now and if it will worsen. ",1,1760529017.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1o78tes,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o78tes/night_shift_at_the_cleveland_lunatic_asylum_was/,Night shift at the Cleveland Lunatic Asylum Was Supposed to Be Easy Money (part 2),"The Nova coughed to life after the third try. I let it idle for a bit, the heater wheezing and blowing cold air at my knees. My hands still felt stiff from the cold, and my back ached in a way that made me realize how long eight hours can feel when you‚Äôre alone and watching nothing happen.

I didn‚Äôt want to go straight home.

There was a Burger King two blocks down from the asylum. It sat at the edge of a busted-up shopping plaza where the only other open business was a check-cashing place with bars on the windows. I parked in front, peeled off my uniform jacket, and went inside.

The place smelled like hot grease and burnt coffee. The booths were hard plastic and stained. Two old guys sat near the window, not talking, just slowly eating like it was the only thing on their calendar today. The counter girl didn‚Äôt even look up when I walked in.

I ordered black coffee and two sausage croissan‚Äôwiches. Ate one at the table, slowly, like I was trying to taste something besides salt and fatigue. The second one sat in the greasy paper bag until I crumpled it up and tossed it in the trash on my way out.

After breakfast, I still didn‚Äôt feel like going home.

I don‚Äôt know if it was the thought of walking back into that cold little studio apartment, or just the leftover nerves from the night shift clinging to my skin like sweat. Either way, I needed to be somewhere with people. Somewhere with light. Somewhere that didn‚Äôt feel like it was slowly rotting from the inside out.

So I drove to **Kmart.**

It was one of the big ones, still open over on West 117th, across from the old pizza buffet that used to smell like melted rubber bands. The kind of Kmart that had that permanent dim lighting, floors so waxed they looked wet, and a weird, almost chemical smell in every aisle ‚Äî like plastic and mildew and something vaguely citrus that couldn‚Äôt quite cover up the age of the place.

I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything in particular.

Just wandering.

But then I found myself in the automotive section, standing in front of the car stereos.

Mine had been broken for months. It only picked up static and the occasional religious broadcast from somewhere in Kentucky. I kept telling myself I‚Äôd replace it once I had a steady paycheck ‚Äî and now, technically, I did. Barely.

The Jensen stereo caught my eye. Nothing fancy, not the cool one with the detachable faceplate and blue backlight ‚Äî just the next model down. Black plastic. Chrome buttons. It had a cassette deck and a digital tuner. That was enough for me.

I bought it without even checking the price tag.

The cashier barely looked at me as I paid. Some teenager with chapped knuckles and a name tag that said ‚ÄúJimmy S.‚Äù I think I said thanks. I don‚Äôt remember if he answered.

Outside, the sun was up and bright, but it didn‚Äôt feel warm. Just overexposed.

I jumped in the car, tossed the stereo behind the seat, and finally drove home.

My apartment was exactly as I left it. Still smelled faintly of old carpet and burnt microwave popcorn. I stripped out of the uniform and dropped it on the back of the only chair I owned. Set my boots by the radiator and stood there for a moment, just listening.

It was too quiet.

I laid down on the mattress, still dressed down to my undershirt, and pulled the blanket up to my chin. My body hurt in places I didn‚Äôt know could hurt. My eyes felt grainy, like they were full of ash.

I didn‚Äôt dream. At least, not that I remembered.

I woke up sometime after nine.

The light leaking through the blinds was that watery, fading kind of gold that meant the sun was already packing it in. My mouth tasted like stale coffee and grease. My back cracked when I stood up. I showered fast ‚Äî the water never got fully hot ‚Äî then pulled my uniform back on, still creased from where I left it.

The Nova fired up on the first try this time, which I took as a good omen, even if the muffler still rattled like it was held on with wire and a prayer.

The drive back to the Cleveland Developmental Center was uneventful, but the sky was starting to dim again. Long shadows stretched across the cracked pavement. The world looked softer and stranger at that hour ‚Äî not quite night, not quite day. In-between. Like the place itself.

As I turned into the main drive, the buildings came into view again ‚Äî those little abandoned cottages huddled around the old asylum like satellites orbiting a dead star.

And for the first time, I realized I didn‚Äôt want to be here.

Not just because of the cold. Not because I was tired.  
Because something felt wrong.

But I was twenty-four, broke, and too stubborn to admit I was scared.

I pulled into the lot around 10:45 p.m., same as the night before. The headlights swept across the empty blacktop and bounced off the squat brick cottages like a searchlight on a battlefield. Everything looked the same, but somehow worse. Like it had been sitting there thinking about me all day.

I killed the engine and sat for a second, listening to it tick as it cooled.

The wind had picked up. It funneled through the narrow spaces between the buildings and made the security office door rattle faintly in its frame.

Inside, the air was stuffy and still held the faint, sour smell of the heater. The monitors were already on, glowing in their little wire cage. One of them showed the south cottage; another rotated through the main corridor of the administration building. All static and silence. Nothing moved. Nothing ever moved ‚Äî except when it did.

I hung my jacket on the back of the folding chair, set my flashlight on the desk, and started my first set of rounds.

The cold bit deeper than the night before. The kind of cold that didn‚Äôt just touch your skin but tried to burrow in. The kind that made your breath feel damp and sharp in your throat.

The cottages were arranged in a horseshoe, maybe fifty yards apart, their windows mostly boarded or caked with grime. I moved from one to the next with my collar turned up and my boots crunching across gravel and frost.

I signed each log in quick, cramped handwriting and moved on fast, never staying longer than I had to. The dark corners of those rooms always felt like they were waiting for something.

By the time I‚Äôd finished the sixth cottage, my gloves were stiff again, and my flashlight battery was already dimming. I made a mental note to hit the drugstore tomorrow.

Back at the office, I locked the door behind me and sat down in front of the monitors. The office chair squeaked under me, loud in the silence. I turned the space heater up to full and warmed my hands in front of it, knuckles red from the cold.

The rest of the night moved slow.

There‚Äôs a strange heaviness to that kind of quiet ‚Äî the kind that starts to press in on you after a few hours. I tried to stay busy. Doodled on the back of a boiler log sheet. Watched the monitors like they were going to surprise me.

Nothing.

A flicker of static here, a hallway light buzzing faintly there. That was it.

It was just before daybreak ‚Äî maybe 5:45 a.m. ‚Äî and I was making my final heater checks, flashlight in one hand, half-eaten apple in the other. I‚Äôd stopped checking the building numbers. My focus was gone, everything smeared together in that early-morning fog when your brain feels like it‚Äôs floating a few feet behind your body.

I stepped into one of the cottages ‚Äî one closer to the center, closer to the asylum. As soon as I crossed the threshold, I felt it. Heavier air. Damper. Like the place was sealed tighter than the rest.

I was halfway through the living room, shining the flashlight toward a wall covered in peeling floral wallpaper, when I heard it:

Children. Laughing.

Not right outside. Not in the distance. Inside the cottage. Above me.

Light, fluttery giggles. Two voices ‚Äî maybe three. Boys or girls, I couldn‚Äôt tell. The kind of laughter kids make when they‚Äôre doing something they know they‚Äôre not supposed to.

My first thought wasn‚Äôt ghosts or anything supernatural. It was: What the hell are kids doing in here?  
I assumed some neighborhood kids had snuck in during the day and fallen asleep. Or were hiding. Maybe even messing with me.

I started toward the hallway, fast and low, like I was about to storm the palace.

And then I stopped.

Because it hit me, suddenly and horribly: There was no upstairs.

None of the cottages had a second floor. No stairs. No attic. Just a single level. Every single unit was built flat, one story, all on concrete slabs. Nothing above but insulation, ceiling panels, and a roof.

But the laughing ‚Äî was still coming from above me. Moving. Like little feet running across a bedroom I knew wasn‚Äôt there.

My chest tightened. All the hair on my neck stood up like someone had jammed a live wire down my shirt.

I didn‚Äôt run, exactly. But I moved fast.

I backed out of the hallway and made a B-line for the door, heart hammering in my throat. I didn‚Äôt look back. I didn‚Äôt shine my light anywhere else. My only thought was get out get out get out.

I pulled the front door open‚Äî

And froze.

There were dogs.

Six, maybe seven of them, in a loose semicircle right outside the steps. Big, rangy mutts ‚Äî not the friendly kind. All ribs and yellow eyes, tails stiff and ears pinned back. One of them had a torn ear. Another had something shiny around its neck, like a bit of chain or wire.

They weren‚Äôt barking. Just growling, low and mean, lips peeled back to show long yellow teeth. The kind of dogs that looked born mean, like they grew up eating bones and broken glass.

But I wasn‚Äôt scared.

Because I had my .38 on me.

I kept it loaded ‚Äî five hollow points in the cylinder and one blank, just in case. Habit from my dad, who said if you ever had to draw a gun, you‚Äôd better be ready to fire it. But sometimes all it takes is the *sight* of the thing.

So I stepped forward, slow, and drew it from my holster ‚Äî not aiming, just letting them see the shape of it, the glint of the barrel.

The change was instant.

The growling stopped. Every dog flinched. One even yelped.

Then they bolted.

All at once, scattering like roaches, tails between their legs, claws scrabbling on the cracked pavement. They didn‚Äôt bark. Didn‚Äôt look back. They just vanished into the fog curling at the edge of the lot.

I stood there for a few long seconds, panting, gun still raised.

Then I shoved it back in my holster and walked fast ‚Äî real fast ‚Äî across the lot toward the admin building to drop off the morning paper.

I needed to see another human being.

The administration building was one of the only ones still partially in use ‚Äî city employees came during the day to sort old medical files and patient logs. The building itself looked like a bloated DMV. Metal handrails that wobbled when you grabbed them. A glass entrance vestibule where a potted plant had died so long ago that someone just left it there, in a layer of dust.

But inside?

Warm. Normal. Safe.

I stepped in, half-expecting another ghostly laugh ‚Äî but no. Just the soft hum of heat through the vents, the buzz of overhead fluorescents, and the sharp chemical smell of cheap lemon-scented floor cleaner.

She was already there, behind the front desk, sorting files into a grey cabinet that looked like it hadn‚Äôt closed properly since 1974.

I didn‚Äôt know her name yet, but I‚Äôd seen her the first day ‚Äî briefly.

Business casual ‚Äî wool skirt, thick tights, flat shoes. A cardigan with a broken button. She had the vibe of someone who taught Sunday school for forty years and would still hit you with a ruler if you didn‚Äôt address her as *ma‚Äôam.*

When I walked in, she glanced up and gave a curt nod.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust, uh... dropping off the paper.‚Äù

She took them without looking at me and placed them neatly on a metal tray next to the coffee pot.

Then she looked at me again. More closely this time.

‚ÄúYou look pale,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI had a weird night.‚Äù

She raised one eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou work here long enough, they‚Äôre all weird.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt planning to say anything.

I must‚Äôve looked pale, because her eyes narrowed behind her thick glasses and she said again, ‚ÄúYou alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù I paused. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt say anything. Just kept staring at me with that teacher-patient expression, like she‚Äôd seen the same look in other people before.

I rubbed the back of my neck. The skin there still felt tight and cold.

‚ÄúI was in one of the cottages ‚Äî near the asylum ‚Äî and I heard kids laughing,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt was above me. Upstairs. But‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBut there is no upstairs,‚Äù she finished.

I looked at her.

She didn‚Äôt look surprised.

‚ÄúAnd when I left,‚Äù I continued, ‚Äúthere were dogs. A whole pack. Like they were waiting for me. But the second I pulled my revolver, they scattered. Like they *knew* what it was.‚Äù

I trailed off, embarrassed by how wild it all sounded now that I‚Äôd said it out loud. But she just nodded, slow, and reached for the coffee pot.

She poured herself a cup ‚Äî no cream, no sugar ‚Äî and sipped it like she had all the time in the world.

‚ÄúYou ever hear of a girl named Eleanor Brooks?‚Äù she asked, without looking at me.

I shook my head.

‚ÄúShe was a patient here. Nineteen, I think. Came in around ‚Äô43 or ‚Äô44. Schizophrenia, maybe. Depression. They used a lot of broad terms back then ‚Äî anything to get someone institutionalized.‚Äù

Her voice was low and even. Like she was reciting a bedtime story she‚Äôd told too many times.

‚ÄúThey said Eleanor liked to walk. Would just wander the halls for hours, day or night. Never spoke. Never looked at anyone. Just drifted from room to room like she was sleepwalking. She'd make these humming sounds, almost like a lullaby.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything. My throat was tight.

‚ÄúOne night, she wandered into the tunnels during a storm. Back when they still used them to transfer patients between buildings. She got turned around. Didn‚Äôt come back.‚Äù

She took another sip.

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt find her for two days.‚Äù

My mouth went dry. ‚ÄúWhere was she?‚Äù

‚ÄúEast tunnel,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNear the old maintenance access. Concrete floor down there gets slick when it floods. They found her curled up in a corner like she‚Äôd just‚Ä¶ fallen asleep. But the cold got her.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow.‚Äù

‚ÄúThing is,‚Äù she continued, ‚Äúher body left a stain. On the floor. You wouldn‚Äôt think that happens, but it does. Blood and oil and‚Ä¶ other things. Sank into the concrete. They‚Äôve painted over it. Stripped it. Scrubbed it with bleach, even tried to seal it with epoxy.‚Äù

She leaned in a little, voice dropping to a whisper like it wasn‚Äôt something she should be saying aloud.

‚ÄúBut it always comes back. Same shape. Same color. Just this dark, wet-looking outline, like she‚Äôs *still there.*‚Äù

I looked down at my boots.

‚ÄúPeople say she still walks,‚Äù the woman said. ‚ÄúStill wanders. Same way she did in life. Only now, she doesn‚Äôt make a sound.‚Äù

I looked back up at her.

She was watching me with that same calm expression ‚Äî not scared, not dramatic, just‚Ä¶ matter-of-fact.

‚ÄúI saw her once,‚Äù she added.

My mouth went dry. ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù

‚ÄúDown by the old file annex. That‚Äôs the hallway behind the tunnel stairwell, east wing.‚Äù She said it like a grocery list, as if that wasn‚Äôt the most terrifying sentence in the world. ‚ÄúI was sorting old intake records. Thought someone was behind me. Turned around, and there she was.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did she look like?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer right away.

Finally, she said, ‚ÄúGhostly.‚Äù

That was all.

Then she stood, dusted off her skirt, and grabbed the metal tray with the newspaper.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like staying here past seven,‚Äù she said, walking toward the back hall. ‚ÄúToo many stories. And stories, you‚Äôll learn, have a way of following you around here.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say another word.

I just stood there for a minute after she left. Listening to the silence she left behind.

Then I walked out the way I came. The sky was starting to go soft with morning ‚Äî that strange lavender-blue you only get for about ten minutes. I pulled my coat tighter, climbed into the Nova, and started the engine.

I didn‚Äôt go straight home that morning.

Couldn‚Äôt.

Even though I was running on fumes, my head was buzzing with too much weird static to lay down. That kind of jittery, greasy feeling you get after too much bad coffee and no sleep ‚Äî where every sound feels too loud and your body‚Äôs tired but your brain just keeps chewing the same thought over and over.

**Eleanor Brooks.**

I couldn‚Äôt get her out of my head. Not the name, but the story.

So instead of collapsing face-first onto my mattress, I drove straight to the Burger King off Harvard ‚Äî same one I‚Äôd hit the night before. I slid into the back booth, the one by the window that looked out toward the street. The blinds were halfway bent and one was broken completely, letting a harsh beam of early sun stab right through and catch me in the face.

I didn‚Äôt bother with food. Just got a large black coffee and sat there with my back to the wall, jacket still zipped.

The place was nearly empty. A woman with a screaming toddler. Two older guys in flannel coats having a raspy conversation about spark plugs. The fryers hissed now and then, but otherwise it was just that buzzing fluorescents-and-formica quiet that fast food places get during the dead hours between breakfast and lunch.

I nursed the coffee until my hands stopped shaking.

I figured the library didn‚Äôt open until nine, maybe nine-thirty, so I killed time doodling on a napkin with a busted pen I found in my coat. I wrote her name a few times ‚Äî *Eleanor Brooks* ‚Äî then circled it. Underlined it. As if that would unlock something. All I knew was that I needed to know more. Needed something to anchor the feeling I had ‚Äî that what I‚Äôd seen, or heard, wasn‚Äôt just in my head.

I finished the coffee, then another. It didn‚Äôt help.

At 9:02, I drove to the Cleveland Public Library on Lorain.

It was already busy ‚Äî school groups and retirees drifting through the tall stone lobby with its carved ceilings and that faint smell of paper, dust, and floor wax. I checked my coat, headed upstairs to the archives.

This was 1987 ‚Äî so no internet. No digital search. No easy way to type in *‚ÄúEleanor Brooks ghost Cleveland asylum‚Äù* and get a thousand hits.

Just a wall of faded wooden card catalogs. Drawers packed tight with yellowed index cards, filed by hand in cursive and clunky typewriter font. I stood there flipping cards for nearly an hour. *Brooks, E.* *Brooks, Eleanor.* *Brooks, Elaine.* Nothing.

Finally, I found a few microfilm reels of old *Plain Dealer* and *Cleveland Press* issues from the 1940s. I squinted into one of those ancient film readers, scrolling through endless sheets of tiny print, my eyes burning.

There were a few mentions of Northern Ohio Lunatic Asylum ‚Äî mostly reports of overcrowding, funding issues, occasional scandals. A doctor accused of misconduct. A breakout in ‚Äô42. Nothing about a missing girl. Nothing about a body in the tunnels.

It was like Eleanor Brooks never existed.

Eventually, I found a brief column ‚Äî maybe 80 words, buried on page 14 of a 1944 issue ‚Äî about an unnamed patient ‚Äúfound deceased in the service tunnels following a two-day search.‚Äù No photo. No follow-up.

That was it.

They didn‚Äôt even give her a name.

It made something twist in my stomach.

I stayed until the librarian politely told me they were closing the archives room for a school tour. I left empty-handed, frustrated, and more unsettled than when I walked in.

If anything, it all felt *worse* now. The fact that no one remembered her ‚Äî that she had no history ‚Äî made the whole thing feel colder. Like the place itself had swallowed her up.

Like it wanted her forgotten.

I went home, finally, but only for a couple of hours. I didn‚Äôt sleep. Just lay there on top of the covers in the dim afternoon light, boots still on, jacket still zipped. I stared at the ceiling and tried not to think about that laughter.

That stain.

When the sun dipped behind the rooftops, I got up, brushed my teeth, changed into my uniform.

I drove to work with the heater blasting and the radio off.

The asylum was already in silhouette by the time I pulled up ‚Äî tall and black and jagged against a fading purple sky.

Same parking spot.

Same flickering overhead light.

Only difference?

This time, I didn‚Äôt feel alone.

I pulled into the lot and sat in the Nova for a long minute, engine idling, eyes locked on the asylum‚Äôs shadow across the field. The sun was gone, but a trace of reddish-purple still smeared the edges of the sky. The building looked darker than the night around it ‚Äî like it was swallowing the last bit of light.

I opened the glove box, stared at the revolver, then grabbed it and slid it into the holster without thinking. The feel of the cold metal calmed me in a way I hated.

I walked across the gravel to the security office. The wind bit harder than it had the last two nights. My ears stung, and my breath came out in thick white bursts that hung too long in the air.

Inside, the heat was already on.

I shut the door behind me and locked it.

My plan was simple: Get it over with. No poking around. No exploring. No more trying to be a ghost detective.

Just check the heaters. Sign the logs. Go home in one piece.

Only‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt do that.

Each cottage had a little binder hung by the front door ‚Äî wire hook, plastic sleeve, single sheet for each month. A line for every date. Just a space to initial and confirm the boiler was working. I didn‚Äôt think twice about it the first night. But now, after what happened‚Ä¶

I decided I wasn‚Äôt going back in.

Not all the way, anyway.

I did a quick lap of the outer ring, moving fast. Cold seeping into my shoes. Every shadow looked like it was breathing. Every porch creaked under my boots like it was trying to warn me. I kept one hand in my coat pocket and the other on the grip of the .38.

I‚Äôd reach the porch, step inside *just enough* to grab the log sheet, and sign my initials with a frozen Bic pen I kept behind my ear. Sometimes I couldn‚Äôt even see the heater from where I stood.

Didn‚Äôt matter.

I wasn‚Äôt going deeper.

By the fifth cottage, my heart was racing. Not from fear exactly, but from *pretending* I wasn‚Äôt afraid.

When I got back to the shack, my hands were trembling. I could barely get the key back in the lock. Once I was inside, I shoved the door shut and turned both deadbolts, top and bottom. Then I dropped into the dented metal chair by the space heater and crouched close, letting the warmth wash over my face like sunlight.

I cowered there for a while. No other word for it.

Just sat there, knees bent, coat still zipped to my chin, hands out to the little orange heater glow like a freezing kid lost in the woods. I didn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt check the monitors. I didn‚Äôt even take my boots off.

I just stared at the wall and tried not to think about that laugh from the night before. Or the dogs. Or the stain.

I don‚Äôt know how long I sat like that. Maybe an hour. Maybe longer.

Then something flickered at the edge of my vision.

A faint, subtle movement ‚Äî not on the monitors. Out the window.

I froze.

Didn‚Äôt breathe. Just stared straight ahead, like if I turned my head too fast it might vanish.

But it didn‚Äôt.

It stayed there.

I slowly leaned toward the glass, one hand gripping the edge of the desk like I needed to anchor myself to something real.

She was standing about thirty feet away, just at the edge of the floodlight‚Äôs reach, out in front of the administration building. Right in the dead center of the cracked concrete walkway. Perfectly still. Like a statue someone had placed there while I wasn‚Äôt looking.

No coat. No shoes. Just a thin, pale dress that looked too white against the dark ‚Äî the kind of white that reflects light in a way fabric shouldn‚Äôt. Her hair hung damp and stringy around her face, and her arms were down at her sides like she didn‚Äôt remember how to move them.

She was barefoot.

Barefoot in twenty-degree weather.

I blinked. Swallowed. Leaned closer to the window.

I couldn‚Äôt make out her face. It was too far ‚Äî too shadowed ‚Äî but the shape of her felt wrong. Not dramatic. Just‚Ä¶ wrong. Like she wasn‚Äôt quite the right height for her body. Or her neck didn‚Äôt turn all the way like it should. Or maybe it was the way her head was tilted slightly to the side ‚Äî too far, too casual, like her bones were bending the wrong way and no one had told her yet.

She wasn‚Äôt looking at anything in particular. Not the window. Not the building. Just‚Ä¶ standing there. Staring off to the left.

I stayed completely still.

My breath fogged the glass.

Then, without warning, she moved.

Not walked ‚Äî turned. Slowly. Awkwardly. Like someone spinning on a lazy Susan. Her bare feet didn‚Äôt shuffle; they pivoted. And she turned to face the building.

Not mine.

The admin building.

She started walking toward it, her pace slow and light, almost like her feet weren‚Äôt touching the ground.

My mouth was dry. I stood up without realizing I had, backing away from the window like it might snap open and suck me out through the glass.

I glanced at the monitors.

Nothing.

The cameras were still rolling ‚Äî grainy footage of the hallway, stairwell and breakroom. All empty. All normal.

I looked back out the window.

She was gone.

Just ‚Äî gone.

No sound. No door creaking open. No footsteps on the gravel or sidewalk. The courtyard was still. Silent. Exactly the way it had been all night.

Except now there was no one standing there.

I stared for another full minute, heart pounding, trying to breathe slowly through my nose. I wanted to tell myself it was someone messing with me. A squatter. A prank. A hallucination brought on by too much caffeine and not enough sleep.

But I hadn‚Äôt blinked.

I know what I saw.

And I knew ‚Äî deep down ‚Äî that I‚Äôd seen Eleanor Brooks.

Not in person.

But something had changed in me.

I wasn‚Äôt curious anymore. I wasn‚Äôt skeptical. I wasn‚Äôt trying to explain anything away with logic or fatigue or stress.

No.

I was done.

Absolutely fking done with Cleveland Developmental Center.

1o78qpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1o78qpr/twenty_four_hours_below_zero/,Twenty four hours Below Zero,"Hi All, 

Just wanted to share first impressions and my experiences with below zero. This is probably a tad heavy on the spoilers.

Introduction movie was good. Landing on the ice was a bit startlingly and i didn't waste any time exploring the ice field. Coming across from Subnautica i knew the fabricator is the key to survival. Got to the pod and then checked through the pda. Love the voice acting. Starting an audio msg and going back to gathering certainly set the mood.

First mistake was priorities new toys like the mineral finder over base and garden building. 

Sprialing out from the pod i found a small grove of kelp and eventually a floating science cage. Second mistake. However missed the O2 tank upgrade below it for another ten hours of gameplay. 

With only two basic air tanks and no vehicles found Sam's house and the first blocked relic site. Got some good scans but was kind of creepy exploring the dark lab.

After that back to the pod. A basic base of a couple of cross section and a grow bed for fruit. Disappointed to learn that fruit is different and provides no water, likewise non caffeine coffee is just heat.

Next was Delta Island. On the way spotted the sos on the relic cables and dropped a beacon 100m deep to follow later. Was sunset when reached island. Kept exploring and running back to heat flowers, slowly going upwards. Was full dark and watching a storm hazardous weather warning when that decked out Prawn jump on top of me. What an Entrance! Love the weather effects. Never know if calm or calamity when surfacing. Checked out the buildings and at daylight climbed the radio tower. The greek letter map was probably the best loot.

Still on only two basic tanks and no vehicles decided to follow her east and deep. Built a long room with two glass corner tubes on each side up on the lilypad directly above the crevices to the moonpool. With lots of trail, error, drained air bladders and a couple of bladderfish eventually memorized the path of balloon plants to get from surface to moonpool. 

This was about hour 8. Had two rude bases, pod and lilypad, survival needs taken care of, and several beacons to follow. Died to drowning multiple times trying to scope further from the moonpool.  Sea monkeys are only dangerous if they steal the seaglide. 

Felt like i was playing on unintended hard mode. Built a scanner room on the seabed above the moonpool and started resource gathering with purpose. Fragment hunting located the first shipwreck. Next mistake was wasting over an hour thoroughly searching for the third unit for scanning. Didn't even realise it there were multiple shipwreck parts until ran into the second half going between pod and lilypad bases.

And kappa mining. Couldn't explore much on limited air so just dropped a beacon.

Now about twelve hours in built another scanner room near the lifepod. Was surprised to get the databox tag. Quickly found the high O2 tank. So much easier to explore went your not racing to get out of caves and reliant on airbags to get to the surface.

About 16 hours in finally got around to making vehicles. Used the seatruck to find the remains of Omega base. Shame there wasn't really room in the hollow to build your own outpost there.

Shut down Delta radio tower and now she wants to talk.

Fifth mistake. Used the prawn to explore east past the lilypads looking for the greenhouse. While the prawn was better for surface walking and warmth it was not easy to get it out of the water. Did find the crashed satellite. 

Finally found the greenhouse. Then realised that it is actually easy to spot from the last south east lilypad. Got eaten by angry critter guarding a thermal vent for nothing. Do love the superfood you get from the greenhouse. And that beacons auto deploy on death and respawn. 

Although i do also have a ""dropped beacon"" past map edge after wondering too far from kappa mining.

With the superfood, coffee and prawn ( although missing the grappling rope third fragment) went looking to phi labs. Could have used a snow blind set of sunglasses. So much white, nighttime or the caves were a relief. Explored as much as i could on foot. Glad i kept finding first aid kits those furry heavyweights eat you on the third hit. Only tried the flares after finding the pda hint. 

Sixth mistake. Snox fox. Had the plans for over three hours before i built it. Wasn't keen as described it seemed like you'd just freeze quicker. Threw up a outpost greenhouse of my own next to jellyfish dock and radio tower. Invaluable with respawn and loot storage. 

Should have made robot pengling before exploring phi base and purple tree valley. Would have saved a lot of backtracking and would have found all the magnetite so much sooner.

Twenty two hours in. Decided to check on that broken green flashing signal. Now i got an architect in my head. And have to revisit and rescan several relic sites found eariler.

Twenty four hours in. Finished Sam's mission to inject the enzyme cure.

Hour twenty five . Ice worns are terrifying.

Overall the humour is more open. TorxWorks subplot has interesting parallels to RL studio stuff. The vanished scientists have left creepy abandoned buildings everywhere. There feels like more to do and map feels more crowded with the ice shelf not having much below the surface. Weather effects are nice show case for the engine. Plot feels more modern and less like a recreation of something the devs played as kids ( planetfall 1983 ).

While i have had some minor graphic glitches, nothing that needed reloading. Some minor issues with building blueprints looking fine but still being red or green when obviously overlapping plants and other stuff.

At this rate will likely get another 8 - 12 hours out of first blind play, but i think with some fore knowledge could do 100 % playthrough in under twenty four hours easily.",1,1760528769.0,subnautica,0,0.67,False

1o78n6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1o78n6a/did_i_do_the_right_thing/,Did I do the right thing?,"I am a 26F south indian, navigating the arranged marriage process, which I began almost a year ago. Initially, I was reluctant due to some of the scary things I'd seen or heard about married life.

However, over time, I recognized the importance of companionship because my psrents and friends explained it to me and I realized my views had been too narrow. Hence, I decided to remain optimistic about the whole process.

‚ÄãAfter a grueling search for prospects, I connected with a guy (30M south indian) who seemed quite decent. We decided to continue conversing by phone after our initial meeting. We had a few hiccups with our schedules: his shift was from 2 PM to 11 PM, while mine was the typical 9-to-5. Initially, we spoke after 11 PM once his shift was over, and he was very respectful about the late hours.
‚ÄãHowever, since I struggled to get up for the office the next day (as I was waiting for his texts at night), I politely suggested we shift our call time to my lunch break. This felt more convenient for both of us and prevented him from thinking I was avoiding him.
‚ÄãWhile discussing superficial topics (as I didn't want to bombard him with serious questions), a fundamental topic came up. 

The conversation was as follows:

‚ÄãHim: ""What do you think about kids?""

‚ÄãMe: ""I like kids, though I have complicated feelings about having them since there are a lot of physical and mental aspects to consider. But yes, if the post-marriage environment is kid-friendly, I definitely would want them‚Äîjust not right this instant. What about you?""

‚ÄãHim: ""Yeah... I don't like them. They are too much responsibility.""

‚ÄãMe: ""Oh, that is reasonable.""

‚ÄãHim: ""Yeah, if given a choice, I won't have them ever, but right now I need to hold it off for 3‚Äì4 years and then, maybe discuss this with my partner and think about it further.""

‚ÄãI was completely confused by his response. While I understood his perspective that marriage isn't solely about having children, my personal reality (even though I sometimes entertain the idea of staying childfree) is that my parents would be devastated if I didn't have kids.

I decided to approach this topic again to clarify his stance:

‚ÄãMe: ""I see your situation is completely reasonable, but you have to understand that this is India, where the pressure from both our parents can become intense. I can hold my parents off for two, maybe three years, but after that, the pressure to have kids will be a constant point of discussion. I don't want you to be forced to have a child later when you are not mentally prepared for it.""

‚ÄãHim: ""But, it is your decision. They can't force it on us.""

‚ÄãMe: ""True, but this is something they feel they are a part of as potential grandparents. They might nag us about our decision, and even if we stay firm, this could potentially hinder our dynamic.""

‚ÄãHim: ""It's your decision; they cannot dictate this. I am clear on my stance: I don't want any kids for three years minimum. Later, my parents are also like yours, and if they put pressure on me, I'll think about it.""

‚ÄãMe: ""Okay, I might have to discuss this with my folks.""

‚ÄãHim: ""Talk to your parents and decide.""
‚Äã
I was completely confused because he had seemed respectful and mature during our earlier conversations, but now I felt he was trying to push this decision onto me entirely. While I understand his stance, the way he said he would ""think about it"" made me feel he was fence-sitting just to convince me to continue. I tried to explain the reality of my situation‚Äîthat my parents might not understand this due to concerns about our increasing age. However, when I was trying to make my points, I felt he didn't engage in the conversation much because he holds such an unwavering stance.

He put effort in contacting me everyday and talking to me and I tried not to hide anything from him. So, his efforts were admirable. However, later on, I also came to know that he also didn't want to get married. He changed his mind because he saw his friends get married. 

Now, I feel the only choice is to respect his decision and part ways.
‚ÄãIs this the right thing to do? Did I assess his stance correctly?

UPDATE: He lied about being a teetotaler, later admitting he is only an occasional drinker. I personally do not mind this, provided he drinks responsibly (I myself drink coffee). My parents, however, were furious because he had initially told them he was a proper teetotaler, claiming he doesn't even drink tea or coffee (shame on me, how dare I drink coffee).
‚ÄãI fought with my parents tooth and nail to convince them it wasn't as bad as they thought. They eventually asked me to tell him to drop drinking altogether after marriage, suggesting he ""sacrifice it for me."" I told both my parents and him that this was an unfair expectation since we barely knew each other.
‚ÄãHowever, because of their concern, I did relay the issue to him and asked him to reconfirm the exact frequency of his occasional drinking (he had vaguely mentioned something like once every six months) so I could accurately manage and convince my parents from here on out.
‚ÄãHis response was, ""Ha ha, I mentioned this already, right?"" He then refused to elaborate, even though I had handed him the exact question on a silver platter to resolve the conflict. I am completely bewildered. Am I being crazy? Am I expecting too much?",1,1760528466.0,Arrangedmarriage,5,0.6,False

I‚Äôve been eating toilet paper for about 7 years iirc, not sure why but the texture feels nice and it kinda calms me down when I‚Äôm stressed (which is always!).

We were showing love in our own ways but somehow neither of us felt loved. Turns out we were speaking completely different languages. Here's what changed everything:

The 5 love languages are:

**1. Words of Affirmation** Verbal compliments, ""I love you,"" encouragement, appreciation. My partner needs to hear it said out loud. I assumed they knew I loved them - wrong. Now I say it explicitly, compliment specific things they do, and leave notes. The difference is night and day.

**2. Quality Time** Undivided attention, real conversations, doing things together. This is mine. I don't care about gifts or help around the house if we're not actually connecting. Put the phone down, turn off the TV, and just be present. That's when I feel most loved.

**3. Receiving Gifts** Thoughtful presents, surprise flowers, little tokens that say ""I was thinking of you."" Not about expensive stuff - it's the thought and effort. I used to think this was materialistic until I met someone whose face lights up at a $3 coffee I brought them.

**4. Acts of Service** Doing helpful things - cooking dinner, handling errands, fixing stuff. ""Actions speak louder than words"" people. My friend's love language is this. Her partner can say ""I love you"" all day, but what makes her feel loved is when he does the dishes without being asked. I know its kind of funny but just sharing what I learned.

**5. Physical Touch** Hugs, holding hands, physical closeness. Not just sex - it's the casual touches throughout the day. Sitting close on the couch, a hand on the shoulder, a quick hug in the kitchen. Some people need physical connection to feel secure.

I was showing love through acts of service (cleaning, cooking, helping) because that's what I valued. My partner needed words of affirmation and quality time. We were both trying hard but completely missing each other. Once we identified our languages, everything clicked.

What actually changed:

I started saying ""I appreciate you"" and ""I'm proud of you"" out loud instead of assuming they knew. They started putting their phone away during dinner and planning activities we could do together. We stopped keeping score and started speaking each other's language.

Your love language is probably different from your partner's, family's, or friends'. You'll naturally give love the way YOU want to receive it. But real love is learning their language and speaking it, even when it feels unnatural at first.

What's your love language? More importantly - do you know the love language of the people you care about? Most people don't so this might help you",3,1760527986.0,emotionalintelligence,1,0.62,False

* **The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the country‚Äôs main car industry lobby, said China‚Äôs new regulations were expected to have ‚Äúfar-reaching consequences.‚Äù**
* **Demand for rare earths and critical minerals is expected to¬†grow exponentially¬†in the coming years as the¬†clean energy transition picks up pace.**
* **Roberto Vavassori, chairman of the Italian auto part maker lobby ANFIA, reportedly said that reserves of rare earth metals were now at risk of being depleted.**

Automotive industry groups have raised the alarm over the ramifications of China‚Äôs latest move to¬†[restrict critical rare earth exports](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/09/china-expands-rare-earth-export-restrictions-ahead-of-possible-trump-xi-meeting.html), saying the measures could pave the way to a period of supply chain chaos.

China‚Äôs Commerce Ministry last week¬†[announced](https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/zwgk/zcfb/art/2025/art_6cb42957741440c6984de696b70df9ae.html)¬†expanded curbs on the export of rare earths and related technologies, seeking to prevent the ‚Äúmisuse‚Äù of minerals in the military and other sensitive sectors.

Beijing has since defended the policy,¬†[saying](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/12/china-defends-rare-earth-export-curbs-as-legitimate-hits-back-at-us-tariffs-ahead-of-possible-trump-xi-meeting.html)¬†it was ‚Äúnot afraid‚Äù of a U.S. trade war after President Donald Trump¬†[threatened](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/10/trump-trade-tariffs-china-software.html)¬†to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports.

Despite an agreement in July designed to fast-track shipments to the region, Europe‚Äôs auto industry has been experiencing¬†[significant disruption](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/05/auto-groups-sound-the-alarm-as-chinas-rare-earth-curbs-start-to-bite.html)¬†after China imposed rare earth export curbs in early April.

The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the country‚Äôs main car industry lobby, said China‚Äôs new regulations were expected to have ‚Äúfar-reaching consequences for deliveries of the affected products to Germany and Europe,‚Äù as well as for their onward transport.

China‚Äôs latest export restrictions will hit the battery and semiconductor industries ‚Äúparticularly hard, and thus also the automotive industry,‚Äù the VDA spokesperson told CNBC by email on Tuesday.

The German car industry lobby called on policymakers in both Brussels and Berlin to tackle the issue ‚Äúforcefully‚Äù with China to quickly find a viable solution.

‚ÄúThe fact is that the Chinese export restrictions on rare earths and permanent magnets implemented in April this year have already significantly exacerbated the supply situation for rare earths and strategic materials. The new measures now go even further,‚Äù the VDA spokesperson said.

Demand for rare earths and critical minerals is expected to¬†[grow exponentially](https://www.iea.org/topics/critical-minerals)¬†in the coming years as the¬†[clean energy transition picks up pace](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/13/countries-agree-to-deal-at-cop28-climate-summit.html).

China is the¬†[undisputed leader](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/14/minerals-us-ukraine-resources-deal-may-be-a-sign-of-things-to-come.html)¬†of the critical minerals supply chain,¬†[accounting](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn3)¬†for roughly 60% of the world‚Äôs production of rare earth minerals and materials. U.S. officials have previously¬†[warned](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/14/us-energy-chief-concerned-about-chinas-critical-minerals-dominance.html)¬†that this poses a strategic challenge amid the pivot to more sustainable energy sources.

# Depleted reserves

Roberto Vavassori, chairman of the Italian auto part maker lobby ANFIA,¬†[reportedly](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-rare-earth-curbs-put-europes-auto-industry-risk-italian-lobby-says-2025-10-14/)¬†said Tuesday that while manufacturers had been able to maintain production when China restricted supplies over the summer, reserves of rare earth metals were now at risk of being depleted.

This buffer ‚Äúis not there anymore,‚Äù Vavassori said at a conference in Milan,¬†[according to Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-rare-earth-curbs-put-europes-auto-industry-risk-italian-lobby-says-2025-10-14/). ANFIA did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.

Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, said China‚Äôs new crackdown on exports is pressing from a supply chain perspective.

‚ÄúChina dominates 90% of global refinery capacity and therefore it‚Äôs a real bottleneck,‚Äù Luman told CNBC by email.

‚ÄúAcross the supply chain there are still inventories, such as at Tradium‚Äôs major storage facility near Frankfurt, so I don‚Äôt expect immediate large fallouts already,‚Äù Luman said.

‚ÄúBut rare earths include a range of elements, some could run short in delivery. And going forward relaxation of supplies is highly dependent on upcoming talks between China,‚Äù he added.

The trade battle between China and America has been intensifying this year, with various tariffs being imposed by both sides, and now, rare earth minerals have taken center stage.

A¬†[map](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2023/3007/fs20233007.pdf), created by the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of the Interior, shows more than 800 areas identified by researchers as showing geological evidence of systems containing 23 types of minerals in the U.S. These include some with rare earths.

However, while America has ‚Äúextractive access to rare earth elements from a mining stage,‚Äù the downstream processing is ‚Äúalmost entirely dependent on China,‚Äù Elsa Olivetti, a professor of materials science and engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told¬†*Newsweek*.

**Why It Matters**

There are 17 rare earth minerals, and these are part of a wider group categorized as ‚Äúcritical.‚Äù

China is home to a third of the world‚Äôs rare earth mineral deposits, it controls around 90 percent of the world‚Äôs production, largely because it has lower labor costs and less rigorous environmental regulations‚Äîrare earth mineral mining and production is recognized as being environmentally harmful.

As a result, America relies heavily on China for its rare earth mineral supply, and between 2020 and 2023, China accounted for 70 percent of the U.S.‚Äô imports, according to Statista.

‚ÄúFor the majority of these elements,¬†the constraint is not geological scarcity,¬†but¬†rather a lack of processing and manufacturing capacity or know-how,‚Äù Olivetti said.

She said that the processing and separation of rare earth elements requires ‚Äúmany tens of hundreds of meticulous solvent extraction to isolate individual rare earth elements,‚Äù which she said has a significant environmental impact and must be ‚Äúmanaged carefully and with technical expertise.‚Äù

Meanwhile, ‚ÄúChina dominates all stages of many critical mineral supply chains not due to geological luck but rather a strategic model of prolonged state support,‚Äù she added.

As a result of these challenges, the U.S. is now ‚Äúhighly reliant‚Äù on China, Ali added, which poses a problem given the escalating trade war.

The U.S.-China trade war over minerals has been intensifying over the years, but this year, after President Donald Trump brought in tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing officially clamped down on export controls of rare earths.

The first of the controls was established in April, whereby foreign companies would have to obtain a license to export items from China containing seven rare earth minerals.

This had major repercussions for U.S., European, and Japanese companies, and while hundreds of export license applications have been filed with Chinese authorities since April, it is estimated¬†that only 25 percent¬†have been approved.

While the U.S. was removed from China‚Äôs trade blacklist in May, on October 9, Beijing‚Äôs Ministry of Commerce announced that it would be implementing more export controls on rare earth minerals.

The move added five more‚Äîholmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium, and, as a result, magnets and materials containing the minerals‚Äîto its list of items under trade controls, bringing the total number to 12 out of the 17 known types.

The ministry said the additional controls were to ‚Äúsafeguard national security and interests.‚Äù

In response, Trump threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese goods by 100 percent and to cancel his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 29. He said Beijing‚Äôs move would have global implications.

‚ÄúThere is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‚Äòcaptive,‚Äô but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the ‚ÄòMagnets‚Äô and, other Elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position, a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least,‚Äù Trump¬†[said¬†](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115350455734003647)on Friday in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.

**What People Are Saying**

**Republican Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, on X:**¬†‚ÄúAmerica is rich in critical rare earth minerals and we must be able to responsibly mine them, in order to not only compete with China, but also for our independence and national security. President Trump and his admin are working to accomplish this however there are many obstacles such as lawsuits, environmental, and permitting issues blocking our ability to mine and process our own rare earth minerals.‚Äù

**President Donald**¬†**Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social:**¬†‚ÄúThey are becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the World, that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths, and virtually anything else they can think of, even if it‚Äôs not manufactured in China‚Ä¶Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one. I have always felt that they‚Äôve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!‚Äù

**Jonas Nahm, a professor of advanced international studies at Johns Hopkins University, Maryland, told**¬†***Newsweek***\*\*:\*\*¬†‚ÄúThe U.S. holds only a fraction of the world‚Äôs rare earth mineral reserves compared to China‚Äôs dominant share, and has far less variety and, perhaps most importantly, far less processing capacity. This gives Beijing far greater leverage over global supply chains: the U.S. depends heavily on imports for over 70 percent of its rare earth needs, with China long serving as the primary source even for processed materials from third countries.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs new rule requiring companies to seek permission before exporting items containing rare earths significantly amplifies that leverage, introducing uncertainty for manufacturers across defense, electronics, and clean-tech sectors. Expanding U.S. production faces major hurdles: rare earth extraction is capital-intensive, environmentally damaging, and hampered by complex permitting and local opposition. Even if new mines come online, building the downstream refining and separation capacity needed to rival China would take years‚Äîmaking a short-term response extremely difficult.‚Äù

**What Happens Next**

While Trump‚Äôs administration has already been implementing measures to expand production of critical minerals more broadly, both on land and offshore, some have said the U.S. urgently needs to increase its rare earth mining and production in light of the ongoing trade war with China.

The two primary methods used to mine rare earth minerals release toxic chemicals into the atmosphere or into groundwater and can have major public health impacts. As a result, countries typically have rigorous regulations around mining, making the process much harder to navigate.

Mining and environmental issues aside, Ali said that America could reduce its reliance on China if it became ‚Äúmore efficient with material usage and recycling.‚Äù

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

# ‚úÖ Positioned at the center of the U.S. Critical Minerals strategy, NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek Project offers:

* Multiple¬†**Top 10 USGS-listed minerals**
* Supply chain independence from China
* Vertical integration across mining, advanced processing, and¬†**future recycling**
* Alignment with the¬†**MCS (Multilateral Commercial Stockpile)**,¬†**DoD offtakes**,¬†**EXIM funding**, and the¬†new SMR Critical Minerals Hub

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek Project isn‚Äôt just another mine ‚Äî it‚Äôs a¬†**national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek‚Äôs mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# üîë The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)**¬†‚Äì The¬†*quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion ‚Äî potentially all ‚Äî of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl‚ÇÑ)**¬†‚Äì Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl‚ÇÑ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)**¬†‚Äì¬†*The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)**¬†‚Äì The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships.¬†*Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ‚ö° Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance**¬†‚Üí Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition**¬†‚Üí Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts**¬†‚Üí 2025 drilling added¬†**9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)**¬†plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October¬†could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

The **critical-minerals ignition sequence is now unmistakable.** Following Mark Smith‚Äôs declaration in D.C. that Elk Creek is a **‚ÄúU.S. National Security Asset,‚Äù** institutional momentum has exploded ‚Äî confirmed by **record-breaking trading volumes exceeding 70 million shares across the last three sessions**, roughly half the entire float.

With **J.P. Morgan now deploying up to $10 billion** toward U.S. economic and national-security infrastructure, Niocorp has entered the **direct line of sight of policy capital** ‚Äî the zone where government, defense, and Wall Street fuse into one vector of strategic financing.

# üõ∞ Catalyst Stack ‚Äì Mid Oct ‚Üí Q4 2025

|Catalyst|Status / Impact|
|:-|:-|
|**Drill Results (Any Day)**|15-hole infill + step-out program could confirm **\~1 million t TREO**, extending mine life & scaling outputs of Nb, Sc, Ti & REEs.|

|**November Scandium Reveal**|First **U.S.-sourced scandium metal** in a century ‚Äî under Defense Prime & DoD demonstration protocols.|

# ‚öô The Strategic Convergence

* **Niobium** ‚Üí""The Quiet Giant!"" Utilized for Hypersonics, SMR's & superconducting alloys
* **Titanium / TiCl‚ÇÑ** ‚Üí Jet-age defense & armor, & aerospace
* **Scandium Alloys** ‚Üí Gen VI air & orbital systems

All four secured under **DOE / USGS / 2024 NDAA mandates**, and all four **co-located in one fully-permitted Nebraska site** ‚Äî land-complete, construction-ready, and now geopolitically classified as critical infrastructure.

# üî• Mission Outlook ‚Äì Record Volume Confirms Ignition

>

The 2025 drill campaign isn‚Äôt incremental ‚Äî it‚Äôs transformational.  
The 2022 FS confirmed 632 K tonnes TREO; this expansion could prove nearly 1 million. Each new assay amplifies resource confidence and valuation multiples across all strategic outputs ‚Äî **Niobium, Scandium, Titanium, REEs** ‚Äî exactly as the U.S. re-arms its domestic supply base.

Combined with the new **S-3ASR capital runway**, Niocorp now commands the full **mine-to-metal-to-manufacturing** architecture the Pentagon has sought for over a decade!

# üß≠ Bottom Line

Washington has lit the policy fuse.  
**Wall Street has confirmed ignition through record accumulation.**  
The Elk Creek Project is no longer a theory ‚Äî it‚Äôs an **activated node in America‚Äôs national-security industrial base.**

Car in question needs a new rear tire due to depth of tread, I knew this so ordered a replacement before taking it in and let the garage know when booking last week - they do tire fitting so saved me a separate journey prior to my usual tire fitters. Arrived at the garage, told them it's due a new tire on the OSR which is in the boot & double checked it would be fitted prior to testing. 

Swanned off into town for a coffee, 20 mins later get a notification from an MOT app on my phone to say cars failed it's MOT on insufficient tread. Headed back to the garage, cars parked up. Spoke to the mechanic: ""yeah it failed on the tire as we knew it would, new one's on now and it's passed - nice car, really tidy example"". Tried explaining that I'd stressed the tire should've gone on prior to testing, as agreed & to preserve a near flawless history. Mechanic was having none of it, said it doesn't matter as it's got a clean sheet now. I didn't want to be the guy arguing over MOT results or their order of operations, so paid up and left.

***It began with the hospital hall.***



***My father has been in and out of the heart ward in the past seven days. The night shifts merge, a collage of coffee that is bad, the drone of fluorescent tubes and the smell of antiseptic that is not naturally able to neutralize the smell of fear. And last night when he had at last fallen into a fitful sleep I went out to clear my head.***



***I started moving to the lounge, but I must have made a wrong turn. The labels on the walls which were generally so distinct, appeared to swim. The passage was long, longer than it ought to have been. The linoleum floor that had been gaudily turquoise, had become a pallid grey, and the electric lamps had an intermittent, arrhythmic flicker. The far call bell of a nursing station died out into a very monotonous, steady murmur.***



***That's when I saw him.***



***There was a figure at the deep end of the corridor, where it was supposed to T-bone at into the east wing. Tall, impossibly so, and thin. It had a bad figure, angles were too great. And its head... The head of God was crowned with a jagged rack of antlers. Not the smooth shelf-branching bones of a deer, but a savage carving of brown bone and rusted coiling wire.***



***I stood motionless, my heart beating wildly against my ribs- a wild hysterical bang of what had happened to my father. I thought that I was simply tired and hallucinating because of stress and sleep deprivation. I hard blinking shook it off, yet there it stood. It was completely motionless, a statue in a crossroad of a hallway that was not supposed to be there.***



***It had no face. No eyes, no nose. A mere, black, vertical swan song running down its mouth. And a thin, grey vapour, curling in the dead air like the sad thread of a ghost, came gushing out of that opening.***



***My primitive brain was crying out to flee, and there was a part of me that was morbid and terrified and held me to my feet. What is that? The idea was a scream inside my head. Is it a patient? Art installation of some sort. The excuses were pitiful, and I stuck to them.***



***I looked too long.***



***The figure did not move, though the air in the air around it seemed to become thicker. The flashing of the lights was in time with the aching in my temples. And then I heard it, not with my ears, but with something within my skull, and it was not a voice, it was a thought that was forced into my own.***

***I reasoned that I was experiencing a waking dream. A panic attack. I returned to my dad in his room clutching my chest and spent the other part of the night watching the constant rise and fall of that, trying to forget the sound of my own name in that dead empty voice.***

I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? I gathered my breath and looked toward the voided ocean. I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. It must have been an old wasp nest from the summer, the worn out boards must attract them each year. Maybe I blinked and that‚Äôs what made me think I saw what I did. That didn‚Äôt explain the texture of it. If it was a dead nest, why wasn‚Äôt it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. Whatever it was, it was gone now. I certainly wasn‚Äôt going under the boardwalk to find out where it went. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. ‚ÄúHello, It‚Äôs Me‚Äù, Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn‚Äôt been sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù.

‚ÄúYour drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?‚Äù he said, gesturing a chugging motion.

‚ÄúOh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.‚Äù

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. There‚Äôs only one way to drink it and that‚Äôs ice cold. If your local watering hole doesn‚Äôt keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don‚Äôt bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

Tommy poured with a heavy hand into the glass in front me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on me, buddy.‚Äù He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. After the night I had, that shot went down awfully smooth. After a brief silence, he spoke up.

‚ÄúYou alright, man? You look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost.‚Äù

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my slowly racing heart. How would I even have began to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent‚Äôs.

When she saw it was me, she smiled and waved. I returned the favor and she made her way to the vacated seat next to me.

‚ÄúDo you come here often?‚Äù she said with a faux twang accent.

‚ÄúI-uh‚Ä¶ reckon.‚Äù I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

I looked out around the bar to find that it was only us. Tommy was missing in action, smoking outside undoubtedly.

‚ÄúLooks like we have the place all to ourselves,‚Äù she remarked with a grin.

‚ÄúTommy shouldn‚Äôt have left the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there.‚Äù I quipped. 

She laughed. ‚ÄúPerfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.‚Äù

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

 ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to another summer in the books,‚Äù she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, ‚ÄúSo are you local year round?‚Äù

I shook my head yes and clarified, ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?‚Äù

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent‚Äôs and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven‚Äôt been on one for miles.

‚ÄúEnough about me, what are you up to?‚Äù A question I was dreading. Maybe it was the brandy talking, I answered very plainly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to figure somethings out. It‚Äôs been a very long couple of years.‚Äù

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. ‚ÄúDo you want to talk about it?‚Äù

I shook it off. ‚ÄúNot particularly, it‚Äôll pass. Just a matter of time.‚Äù

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

‚ÄúHey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre‚Äôs, actually. We have one just like it.‚Äù

She looked down and declared. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs hilarious, that‚Äôs where I stole this from!‚Äù

We both laughed.

‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt surprise me,‚Äù I remarked. ‚ÄúThe staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.‚Äù

Our laughter echoed the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song ‚Äî ‚ÄúThese Eyes‚Äù by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss. 

She continued, ‚ÄúThe Stones are my dad‚Äôs favorite band. He named me Angie after the song.‚Äù 

I liked that, it fit her.

‚ÄúMy dad loved them too,‚Äù I concurred. ‚ÄúHe took me to see them when I was a kid.‚Äù

She smiled. ‚ÄúSounds like a great dad to me.‚Äù

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me ‚Äî maybe she‚Äôd like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù she inquired.

‚ÄúYeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.‚Äù

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would‚Äôve seen it, right? Unless‚Ä¶ did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, ‚ÄúLooks like I‚Äôm not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre‚Äôs.‚Äù

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone ‚Äî few missed calls, few texts I didn‚Äôt care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick‚Äôs. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn‚Äôt like to be kept waiting ‚Äî Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, ‚ÄúI have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.‚Äù

Angie smiled wide. ‚ÄúI love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?‚Äù

There was a pause. I didn‚Äôt know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn‚Äôt feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick‚Äôs.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she‚Äôs good I‚Äôll grab a slice for her this weekend.‚Äù

That was the best I could do. It was better than ‚ÄúRun as fast as you can.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you need me to walk you home?‚Äù

She responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It‚Äôs their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.‚Äù

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. ‚ÄúI can wait here with her, I‚Äôm still cleaning up. I‚Äôll see you tomorrow night.‚Äù

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit, waving goodbye. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, ‚ÄúYou never told me your name!‚Äù

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt really matter.‚Äù

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality ‚Äî this one was thick and palatable. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights ‚Äî an offseason signature ‚Äî and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky. Living by the water teaches you to prepare for weather that changes on a dime.

I crept to the corner, hoping to get a glimpse of where my fateful fall had taken place hours before. The only thing I could make out was the beginning of the ramp that led to the boardwalk. The mixture of fog and Mick‚Äôs bright neon sign only gave me passing glimpses of Mighty King Kong‚Äôs scowl.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there ‚Äî just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area ‚Äî no sight of the album. It was around this time that the fog momentarily cleared that I noticed it was a full moon. If there was indeed a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning.

I decided I was being paranoid. Enough was enough. I took my phone out with resolve and took confident steps to the mouth of the boardwalk. I turned my flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took two steps forward, searching the sandy floor ‚Äî nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot.

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the front of the album sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye ‚Äî the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn‚Äôt stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my trembling feet prevailed. This went on forever, using the sand underneath as camouflage. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate ‚Äî it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.

If you‚Äôre reading this, it‚Äôs because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it‚Äôs hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We‚Äôre barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it‚Äôs already a ghost town. That‚Äôs where this all began ‚Äî a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

‚ÄúSpectre‚Äôs: Records & Rarities‚Äù; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn‚Äôt be able to name a single song off the album they‚Äôre donning. It really was a place frozen in time ‚Äî the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game ‚Äî finding an album I‚Äôd never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I‚Äôm not going to play them, who will?

Tonight‚Äôs choice: ‚ÄúSecret Treaties‚Äù by Blue √ñyster Cult. Of course, I knew ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Fear the Reaper‚Äù ‚Äî who doesn‚Äôt? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70‚Äôs. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of ‚ÄúCareer of Evil‚Äù blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn‚Äôt have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled ‚ÄúHarvester of Eyes‚Äù certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn‚Äôt care anyway ‚Äî he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn‚Äôt have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than B√ñC was the ticking clock that sat above an old ‚ÄúPlan 9 From Outer Space‚Äù poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn‚Äôt nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody‚Äôs grave. That was the reality of this place ‚Äî four months out of the year, it‚Äôs so full of life that it‚Äôs overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that‚Äôs why I never left. If I don‚Äôt visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting ‚Äî this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him ‚Äî which was two blocks away ‚Äî there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn‚Äôt want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent‚Äôs Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

‚ÄúOh my god! You scared me!‚Äù she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.‚Äù

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

‚ÄúSure, sure. Three bucks.‚Äù

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. ‚ÄúSo, any plans tonight?‚Äù

I thought about it, and I really didn‚Äôt have any. I knew my ritual at this point ‚Äî work and then visit Mick‚Äôs for a drink or two until I‚Äôve had enough to put me to sleep.

‚ÄúI was going to head over to Mick‚Äôs, maybe catch the game for a bit.‚Äù

She grinned. ‚ÄúI know Mick‚Äôs ‚Äî right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I‚Äôll stop by. There isn‚Äôt much else to do on a night like tonight.‚Äù

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll see you there,‚Äù I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice ‚Äî might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

‚ÄúHey bud, I haven‚Äôt seen you in a while.‚Äù

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. ‚ÄúHey Mac, long time.‚Äù

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been dead out here, huh?‚Äù

Without looking up, he lamented, ‚ÄúSure has. It‚Äôs that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.‚Äù

Puzzled, I pressed him. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. ‚ÄúI need to get some help. I‚Äôm going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.‚Äù

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn‚Äôt have been happier.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great, man! I‚Äôd give you a ride myself if I had a car.‚Äù

I chuckled ‚Äî that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. ‚ÄúI just need to see her again.‚Äù

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and‚Ä¶ everything just started falling apart‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just ready. Tonight‚Äôs my last night ‚Äî I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.‚Äù

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn‚Äôt know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. ‚ÄúVincent‚Äôs was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I‚Äôll see you, I won‚Äôt take no for an answer.‚Äù

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.‚Äù

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. ‚ÄúI really think what you‚Äôre doing is great. It‚Äôs been nice knowing you.‚Äù

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. ‚ÄúYou too. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôll see you again, but I really hope it‚Äôs not here.‚Äù

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs your real name, by the way? Maybe I‚Äôll look you up someday to see how you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù

Without turning fully around, he said, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt really matter.‚Äù

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick‚Äôs resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk ‚Äî the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick‚Äôs served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick‚Äôs was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig ‚Äî Mick‚Äôs was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it ‚Äî when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp‚Äôs nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn‚Äôt a wasp‚Äôs nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving ‚Äî rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was‚Ä¶ breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn‚Äôt very big ‚Äî maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn‚Äôt help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

1o78aib,https://www.reddit.com/r/UUreddit/comments/1o78aib/venting_about_church_on_sunday/,Venting about church on Sunday,"Hi friends,

I needed a place to vent about my church experience on Sunday and am posting here. 

I am on my church's hospitality committee, and there is a point person every month who checks in with the social hour hosts and helps them along. I was subbing in for someone this Sunday, and got there early and started unloading the dishwashers and setting up tables. (We have a sexton, but maybe the dishwasher/tables is not in his job description.) When I got to the kitchen, I started having a few issues. I brought my Neti Pot to church (because I didn't have time to do it at home because I was there so early) and did it in the bathroom, and when I told one of the social hour hosts this, I got a condescending ""Oh, honey!"" in response. Then the two social hour hosts were kind of talking around me and not including me in the conversation. I was standing there silently cutting banana bread and coffee cake, and it felt crummy to not be included, so I figured they were all set and sat in another room in the corner, texting with friends. Once they were all set up, I went over to the service and was sitting in the back right corner and was playing with my phone a little. I looked up and the minister was glaring at me - this happened twice. I realize that I shouldn't have been on my phone during worship, but it was a response to being ignored. (And other people multitask during the service sometimes.) When it was time to go, I told one of the social hour hosts that it was nice working with her and got a semi-dismissive ""Yeah!"" in response. That host was not including me again and was talking to another person in French. 

So this whole adventure did not leave me feeling great. I acknowledge that it isn't all about me and that I am very shy and sensitive. But also, if someone is quiet and not being included, sometimes it's a good idea to ask why. Do they want to be quiet? Are they not talking for a reason? Should someone try to include them?

Thanks for listening and open to any advice/suggestions!",0,1760527339.0,UUreddit,5,0.5,False

I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? I gathered my breath and looked toward the voided ocean. I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. It must have been an old wasp nest from the summer, the worn out boards must attract them each year. Maybe I blinked and that‚Äôs what made me think I saw what I did. That didn‚Äôt explain the texture of it. If it was a dead nest, why wasn‚Äôt it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. Whatever it was, it was gone now. I certainly wasn‚Äôt going under the boardwalk to find out where it went. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. ‚ÄúHello, It‚Äôs Me‚Äù, Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn‚Äôt been sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù.

‚ÄúYour drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?‚Äù he said, gesturing a chugging motion.

‚ÄúOh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.‚Äù

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. There‚Äôs only one way to drink it and that‚Äôs ice cold. If your local watering hole doesn‚Äôt keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don‚Äôt bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

Tommy poured with a heavy hand into the glass in front me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on me, buddy.‚Äù He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. After the night I had, that shot went down awfully smooth. After a brief silence, he spoke up.

‚ÄúYou alright, man? You look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost.‚Äù

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my slowly racing heart. How would I even have began to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent‚Äôs.

When she saw it was me, she smiled and waved. I returned the favor and she made her way to the vacated seat next to me.

‚ÄúDo you come here often?‚Äù she said with a faux twang accent.

‚ÄúI-uh‚Ä¶ reckon.‚Äù I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

I looked out around the bar to find that it was only us. Tommy was missing in action, smoking outside undoubtedly.

‚ÄúLooks like we have the place all to ourselves,‚Äù she remarked with a grin.

‚ÄúTommy shouldn‚Äôt have left the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there.‚Äù I quipped. 

She laughed. ‚ÄúPerfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.‚Äù

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

 ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to another summer in the books,‚Äù she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, ‚ÄúSo are you local year round?‚Äù

I shook my head yes and clarified, ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?‚Äù

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent‚Äôs and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven‚Äôt been on one for miles.

‚ÄúEnough about me, what are you up to?‚Äù A question I was dreading. Maybe it was the brandy talking, I answered very plainly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to figure somethings out. It‚Äôs been a very long couple of years.‚Äù

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. ‚ÄúDo you want to talk about it?‚Äù

I shook it off. ‚ÄúNot particularly, it‚Äôll pass. Just a matter of time.‚Äù

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

‚ÄúHey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre‚Äôs, actually. We have one just like it.‚Äù

She looked down and declared. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs hilarious, that‚Äôs where I stole this from!‚Äù

We both laughed.

‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt surprise me,‚Äù I remarked. ‚ÄúThe staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.‚Äù

Our laughter echoed the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song ‚Äî ‚ÄúThese Eyes‚Äù by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss. 

She continued, ‚ÄúThe Stones are my dad‚Äôs favorite band. He named me Angie after the song.‚Äù 

I liked that, it fit her.

‚ÄúMy dad loved them too,‚Äù I concurred. ‚ÄúHe took me to see them when I was a kid.‚Äù

She smiled. ‚ÄúSounds like a great dad to me.‚Äù

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me ‚Äî maybe she‚Äôd like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù she inquired.

‚ÄúYeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.‚Äù

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would‚Äôve seen it, right? Unless‚Ä¶ did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, ‚ÄúLooks like I‚Äôm not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre‚Äôs.‚Äù

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone ‚Äî few missed calls, few texts I didn‚Äôt care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick‚Äôs. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn‚Äôt like to be kept waiting ‚Äî Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, ‚ÄúI have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.‚Äù

Angie smiled wide. ‚ÄúI love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?‚Äù

There was a pause. I didn‚Äôt know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn‚Äôt feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick‚Äôs.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she‚Äôs good I‚Äôll grab a slice for her this weekend.‚Äù

That was the best I could do. It was better than ‚ÄúRun as fast as you can.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you need me to walk you home?‚Äù

She responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It‚Äôs their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.‚Äù

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. ‚ÄúI can wait here with her, I‚Äôm still cleaning up. I‚Äôll see you tomorrow night.‚Äù

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit, waving goodbye. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, ‚ÄúYou never told me your name!‚Äù

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt really matter.‚Äù

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality ‚Äî this one was thick and palatable. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights ‚Äî an offseason signature ‚Äî and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky. Living by the water teaches you to prepare for weather that changes on a dime.

I crept to the corner, hoping to get a glimpse of where my fateful fall had taken place hours before. The only thing I could make out was the beginning of the ramp that led to the boardwalk. The mixture of fog and Mick‚Äôs bright neon sign only gave me passing glimpses of Mighty King Kong‚Äôs scowl.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there ‚Äî just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area ‚Äî no sight of the album. It was around this time that the fog momentarily cleared that I noticed it was a full moon. If there was indeed a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning.

I decided I was being paranoid. Enough was enough. I took my phone out with resolve and took confident steps to the mouth of the boardwalk. I turned my flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took two steps forward, searching the sandy floor ‚Äî nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot.

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the front of the album sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye ‚Äî the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn‚Äôt stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my trembling feet prevailed. This went on forever, using the sand underneath as camouflage. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate ‚Äî it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.

From streaming platforms and online shopping to social media and global news, everything you do online is tracked, analyzed, or restricted. That‚Äôs why I rely on a VPN to protect my digital footprint. It encrypts my traffic, conceals my IP address, and restores the freedom to browse without limits. After putting multiple VPN services to the test, I‚Äôve gathered key insights on what truly matters‚Äîencryption strength, streaming access, and overall value. Here‚Äôs how the leading providers stacked up.  
  
What I Look for in a VPN

When choosing a VPN, I focused on what mattered most for my daily **operations**:

* **No-logs policy:** I want zero records of my browsing.
* **Robust encryption:** AES-256 is my go-to for security.
* **Expeditious speeds:** Crucial for streaming shows or gaming.
* **Global servers:** More servers mean better access to content.
* **Reliable protocols:** Options like Wire Guard or OpenVPN for smooth, secure connections.
* **Fair pricing:** Good protection shouldn‚Äôt cost a **fortune**.

# My Experience with Top VPNs

I tested a mix of well-known and newer VPNs to see how they performed in **practice**. Here‚Äôs what stood out.

# CoverMeVPN

I tried this lesser-known VPN, and here‚Äôs what surprised me: it delivered strong encryption and a no-logs policy that gave me **tranquility**. Streaming Netflix and Hulu was effortless with no geo-blocks, and the speeds were solid for gaming too. It‚Äôs affordable, easy to use for beginners like me, and still has enough features for advanced users. It felt like a great **well-rounded** choice.

# NordVPN

This is a heavy hitter I kept **hearing** about. Its Double VPN and extra security features made me feel secure, especially on public Wi-Fi. The huge server network meant I could always find a fast connection, and it never felt sluggish, whether I was browsing or streaming.

# ExpressVPN

This one was a **marvel** for streaming. I could access Netflix instantly, and the speeds were so fast I forgot I was using a VPN. The apps were super easy to navigate, and its Lightway protocol kept things secure without slowing me down. It‚Äôs pricier, but it delivered every **time**.

# Surfshark

Surfshark was a budget-friendly **victory**. I loved that I could connect all my devices‚Äîphone, laptop, you name it‚Äîwithout limits. It balanced speed and security well, and the price felt like a steal for what I got. It worked smoothly for both streaming and casual browsing.

# ProtonVPN

Coming from the ProtonMail team, this one felt **reliable** from the start. Its focus on privacy was clear, and I appreciated the transparency. The free tier was handy for testing, but it had limits on servers and speed. The paid version was much better and worth it for privacy-conscious users like me.

# Why I Won‚Äôt Browse Without a VPN

Here‚Äôs why a VPN became **essential** for me:

* **Privacy protection:** It stops ISPs and advertisers from tracking my every click.
* **Public Wi-Fi safety:** I feel secure checking my bank account at a **coffee shop**.
* **Bypassing restrictions:** I can access content blocked in my region.
* **Streaming freedom:** I watch shows and sports from anywhere in the world.
* **Secure transactions:** Shopping and banking stay private and safe.

**üöÄ Wrapping Up**  
In today‚Äôs digital world, protecting your privacy, security, and freedom online isn‚Äôt optional; it‚Äôs essential.

Well-known providers like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and Surfshark dominate the spotlight, but newer services such as [CoverMeVPN](https://covermevpn.com/) are stepping up with powerful encryption, competitive features, and budget-friendly plans. That makes them a smart option for anyone serious about safeguarding their online life.

1o788i3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyBonfire/comments/1o788i3/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk_part_1/,There‚Äôs Something Under The Boardwalk - Part 1,"If you‚Äôre reading this, it‚Äôs because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it‚Äôs hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We‚Äôre barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it‚Äôs already a ghost town. That‚Äôs where this all began ‚Äî a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

‚ÄúSpectre‚Äôs: Records & Rarities‚Äù; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn‚Äôt be able to name a single song off the album they‚Äôre donning. It really was a place frozen in time ‚Äî the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game ‚Äî finding an album I‚Äôd never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I‚Äôm not going to play them, who will?

Tonight‚Äôs choice: ‚ÄúSecret Treaties‚Äù by Blue √ñyster Cult. Of course, I knew ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Fear the Reaper‚Äù ‚Äî who doesn‚Äôt? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70‚Äôs. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of ‚ÄúCareer of Evil‚Äù blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn‚Äôt have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled ‚ÄúHarvester of Eyes‚Äù certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn‚Äôt care anyway ‚Äî he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn‚Äôt have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than B√ñC was the ticking clock that sat above an old ‚ÄúPlan 9 From Outer Space‚Äù poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn‚Äôt nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody‚Äôs grave. That was the reality of this place ‚Äî four months out of the year, it‚Äôs so full of life that it‚Äôs overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that‚Äôs why I never left. If I don‚Äôt visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting ‚Äî this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him ‚Äî which was two blocks away ‚Äî there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn‚Äôt want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent‚Äôs Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

‚ÄúOh my god! You scared me!‚Äù she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.‚Äù

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

‚ÄúSure, sure. Three bucks.‚Äù

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. ‚ÄúSo, any plans tonight?‚Äù

I thought about it, and I really didn‚Äôt have any. I knew my ritual at this point ‚Äî work and then visit Mick‚Äôs for a drink or two until I‚Äôve had enough to put me to sleep.

‚ÄúI was going to head over to Mick‚Äôs, maybe catch the game for a bit.‚Äù

She grinned. ‚ÄúI know Mick‚Äôs ‚Äî right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I‚Äôll stop by. There isn‚Äôt much else to do on a night like tonight.‚Äù

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll see you there,‚Äù I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice ‚Äî might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

‚ÄúHey bud, I haven‚Äôt seen you in a while.‚Äù

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. ‚ÄúHey Mac, long time.‚Äù

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been dead out here, huh?‚Äù

Without looking up, he lamented, ‚ÄúSure has. It‚Äôs that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.‚Äù

Puzzled, I pressed him. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. ‚ÄúI need to get some help. I‚Äôm going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.‚Äù

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn‚Äôt have been happier.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great, man! I‚Äôd give you a ride myself if I had a car.‚Äù

I chuckled ‚Äî that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. ‚ÄúI just need to see her again.‚Äù

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and‚Ä¶ everything just started falling apart‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just ready. Tonight‚Äôs my last night ‚Äî I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.‚Äù

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn‚Äôt know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. ‚ÄúVincent‚Äôs was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I‚Äôll see you, I won‚Äôt take no for an answer.‚Äù

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.‚Äù

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. ‚ÄúI really think what you‚Äôre doing is great. It‚Äôs been nice knowing you.‚Äù

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. ‚ÄúYou too. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôll see you again, but I really hope it‚Äôs not here.‚Äù

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs your real name, by the way? Maybe I‚Äôll look you up someday to see how you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù

Without turning fully around, he said, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt really matter.‚Äù

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick‚Äôs resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk ‚Äî the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick‚Äôs served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick‚Äôs was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig ‚Äî Mick‚Äôs was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it ‚Äî when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp‚Äôs nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn‚Äôt a wasp‚Äôs nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving ‚Äî rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was‚Ä¶ breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn‚Äôt very big ‚Äî maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn‚Äôt help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

1o788hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/1o788hb/i_built_a_system_that_predicts_when_my_meta_ads/,I Built a System That Predicts When My Meta Ads Will Die (Before They Die) Then Auto-Refreshes Them Using Google Display Data,"Ever had a Meta ad crushing it at $32 CPA... then you wake up two days later and it's suddenly $89?

Your CTR tanked overnight. CPM through the roof. And now you're in full panic mode trying to figure out what the hell happened.

Yeah. I've been there too many times.

I used to spend entire weekends scrambling to create new ad creative because my winners would just... die. No warning. Just dead.

Lost probably $4-5k learning this the hard way.

But I figured out something that changed everything:¬†**you can actually predict when your ads are about to die.**¬†And more importantly, you can have replacements ready BEFORE the crash happens.

Let me show you how.

**The Pattern Nobody Talks About**

So I got obsessed with this problem. Started tracking every metric on my winning ads - not just the surface stuff, but frequency, CTR trends, cost trends, everything.

After looking at like 40+ ads that went from hero to zero, I noticed they all followed the same death pattern:

**Days 1-4:**¬†Frequency sitting around 1.2-1.8, CTR climbing every day, CPA dropping. You're feeling like a genius.

**Days 5-9:**¬†Frequency hits 1.8-2.5 range, CTR plateaus but stays solid, CPA is stable. This is the sweet spot where you're just printing money.

**Days 10-14:**¬†Frequency creeps to 2.5-3.2, CTR starts slowly declining (maybe you lose 0.2-0.3% per day), CPA starts ticking up.¬†**This is your warning zone**¬†\- you've got maybe 3-5 days before things get ugly.

**Days 15+:**¬†Frequency over 3.2, CTR absolutely craters, CPA explodes. Your ad is cooked. Dead. Toast.

The thing is, most people only notice when they're already at day 15+. By then you're bleeding money and rushing to create something new.

**My Early Warning System**

I'm not gonna lie - I'm not some coding wizard. But I managed to piece together a Google Sheet that pulls my Meta Ads data every morning using the API.

The sheet automatically calculates:

* Current frequency for each ad
* CTR trend (comparing last 3 days vs previous 3 days)
* Whether an ad is entering the ""warning zone""

When an ad crosses frequency 2.5 AND CTR drops more than 0.3% from the previous period, the whole row turns yellow. That's my signal.

I get a Slack message that literally just says ""Ad XYZ entering warning zone - prep replacement.""

Now I've got 3-5 days to get a replacement ready instead of scrambling at the last minute.

***But here's where it gets interesting.***

**The Google Display ""Farm System""**

Creating new Meta ad creative from scratch is expensive and time-consuming. You're basically gambling that your new concept will work.

I needed a cheaper way to test concepts before committing to them on Meta.

That's when I started using Google Display as my creative testing lab.

Here's the process:

**1. For every Meta ad concept I launch, I immediately create 3-5 variations in Google Display**

Same core concept, but different:

* Headlines
* Image treatments
* CTAs
* Emphasis points

For example, if my Meta ad is selling a coffee grinder with the angle ""caf√© quality at home,"" my Display variations might be:

* Version A: ""Barista-grade coffee in your kitchen""
* Version B: ""Stop wasting money at Starbucks""
* Version C: ""Your morning coffee deserves better""
* Version D: ""15-second caf√©-quality espresso""

**2. Run them on Google Display for 7 days at like $10-15/day each**

Display traffic is way cheaper than Meta. I'm getting way more impressions and clicks for my testing budget.

After a week, the data tells me which angle is resonating. Usually one version clearly outperforms.

**3. Build the winner as a Meta ad and keep it paused**

I take the winning Display concept and adapt it for Meta format (usually stories + feed). Upload it but leave it paused.

It's sitting there ready to go.

**4. When my Warning Zone alert fires, I swap**

Original ad hits 2.5 frequency with declining CTR? I pause it and unpause the pre-tested replacement.

No downtime. No panic. No guessing if the new creative will work - I already know it resonates because Display told me.

**What Actually Happened**

I've been running this system for about 5 months now. The difference is honestly kind of crazy.

**Before:**

* Would lose 3-4 days per month in ""emergency creative mode""
* Ad performance would cliff-dive before I caught it
* CPA would spike 60-80% before I could react
* Couldn't scale aggressively because I was terrified of ad fatigue

**After:**

* Same-day creative swaps
* CTR stays 35-45% higher on average (because I'm never running dead ads)
* CPA is way more consistent - no more dramatic spikes
* Can scale spend faster because I know I have replacements queued

The Google Display testing budget ($300-400/month) has probably saved me $3-4k in wasted Meta spend. Plus I'm just way less stressed.

**The Technical Setup**

Look, I'm not a developer. If I can set this up, you probably can too.

**The Spreadsheet:**

* Connected to Meta Ads API using Supermetrics (costs like $20/month)
* Pulls ad performance data daily at 6am
* Conditional formatting highlights warning zone ads in yellow
* Simple IF formulas to calculate CTR trends

**The Slack Alert:**

* Used Zapier to connect Google Sheets ‚Üí Slack
* When a cell turns yellow, Zapier sends me a message
* Takes like 10 minutes to set up

**The Naming System:**¬†This is actually the most important part. I name my ads like this:

* Meta:¬†`[Product]_[Angle]_[Format]_V1`
* Display:¬†`[Product]_[Angle]_[Variation A/B/C]_TEST`

So I always know which Display test corresponds to which Meta concept.

**The Display Campaigns:**

* Always-on Display campaigns
* Broad targeting (I'm testing creative, not audience)
* Manual CPC bidding to control costs
* Very simple: just testing which messaging works

**Stuff I Learned the Hard Way**

**1. Don't wait for frequency 3.0+**

By then it's too late. Your ad is already dying. The 2.5 threshold gives you enough runway.

**2. Display performance doesn't directly predict Meta performance**

A 2% CTR on Display doesn't mean you'll get 2% on Meta. But relative performance (A beats B beats C) almost always transfers.

**3. Have at least 2 replacements ready at all times**

Sometimes your Display winner still flops on Meta. Having a backup to the backup saves your ass.

**4. Don't kill ads at exactly 2.5 frequency**

If CTR is still climbing or stable, let it run. The warning zone is just a heads-up to get ready, not an automatic kill switch.

**5. This works way better for cold traffic than retargeting**

Retargeting audiences are smaller - you'll hit fatigue faster and the patterns are less predictable.

**The Real Unlock**

The biggest thing isn't even the system itself.

It's that I stopped being reactive and started being proactive.

I'm not waiting for ads to die anymore. I'm preparing for it. And that mental shift alone probably improved my ad performance more than any tactic.

If you're spending $3k+/month on Meta and dealing with the ad fatigue rollercoaster, this is worth building.

1o78734,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1o78734/explore_if_pink_stuff_miracle_cleaning_bundle/,Explore if Pink Stuff Miracle Cleaning Bundle Really Works,"Getting my hands on the Pink Stuff PSPMC Miracle Cleaning Bundle has been quite an eye-opener. This compact trio of the paste, multi-purpose spray, and cream cleaner promised to make cleaning less of a chore and, honestly, it delivered in ways I hadn‚Äôt anticipated. I‚Äôll admit, I went into this with healthy skepticism‚Äîlet‚Äôs be real, no one loves scrubbing sinks or stovetops, but these products might just make you rethink that.

**Ease of Use for Everyday Messes**  
The multi-purpose spray quickly became a staple in my daily cleaning arsenal. Ready to go straight out of the bottle, it tackled everything from greasy kitchen countertops to stubborn coffee splatters on my dining table. It even worked on my stainless-steel fridge without leaving streaks, which is something I‚Äôve had countless battles with in the past. The spray felt efficient, and it reduces the mental load of cleaning because, let‚Äôs face it, sometimes the hardest part is just starting.

**Tough Stains, Be Gone!**  
On one hand, the paste was a bit more ‚Äúhands-on.‚Äù I found myself using it with a brush or sponge to tackle stuck-on messes, but wow, the results were worth that little extra effort. One of the real tests was my stovetop‚Äîa landmine of cooking disasters. Grease stains that normally require soaking and scrubbing melted away. Even my kids commented on how ‚Äúshiny‚Äù the stove looked, which might be the first compliment I‚Äôve ever gotten on a cleaned appliance. Bonus: it didn‚Äôt reek of chemicals while I cleaned.

**A Surprisingly Gentle Option**  
The cream cleaner stood out because it managed to walk that fine line‚Äîaggressive enough to battle grime yet gentle on surfaces like glass and ceramic. Cleaning my bathroom sink, which has these annoying soap and toothpaste marks, became so much easier with this product. And let‚Äôs talk about tiles for a second: I tested it on pesky grout lines, and while it didn‚Äôt magically make them brand-new, there was visible improvement. My mom even asked what I‚Äôd used when she stopped over for tea and spotted the difference.

**Key Benefits**  
- Highly effective on grease, grime, and stubborn stains.  
- Safe for a variety of surfaces, from stainless steel to glass.  
- Compact bundle that covers a wide range of cleaning needs.  
- Kid and pet-friendly‚Äîno harsh, lingering chemical smells.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The paste can leave a bit of residue if not fully rinsed away.  
- The spray bottle nozzle occasionally seems uneven in distribution.  
- Some surfaces, like delicate marble, required patch tests to ensure no dulling occurs.  

**Direct Competitors**  
Comparing this to some other similar products like Bar Keepers Friend or Scrubbing Bubbles, the Pink Stuff bundle excels with versatility. Unlike Bar Keepers Friend, which often leans heavily abrasive, this felt more balanced, especially on ceramic and stainless surfaces. Scrubbing Bubbles might edge it out for bathroom-specific grime, but it doesn‚Äôt have the same all-around utility. And while both competitors do their job, they can‚Äôt touch the Pink Stuff when it comes to residue-free results and pleasant after-smell.

**Smart Spending**  
While it‚Äôs not often I label cleaning products ‚Äúworth every penny,‚Äù this feels like an exception. Bundling three different products taps into multiple challenges across the home, and the longevity of each seems significant. I‚Äôve gone weeks using these daily in high-traffic areas before I even hit the halfway point. That level of durability adds financial value, nipping the need to constantly repurchase cleaning supplies. For anyone aiming to declutter their arsenal of half-used products, this trio is a budgeting no-brainer.

1o783t0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o783t0,Advice needed before first HM,"Hello there fellow runners, I would need your advice for my first HM and to make sure, that my research and evaluation is on point.

# Info about me:

**running exp :** I have been running on and off (rather off) for some time, but started to pick up running seriously end of this June. Back then my max distance was a 10K. I never followed any training up until this July.

**current fitness:** Since July I am following the Garmin daily suggested workouts most of the time, skipping some trainings since I have been doing other sports as well (daily cycling to and from work, bouldering, yoga, spinning), so I would say I am fairly fit.

**training history:** I have attached some screenshots. The last run from yesterday should've been a tempo run, but I couldn't really get my HR high enough, legs felt kinda sore and did not want to push myself too much 5 days before the HM. Nevertheless I got a new PR in the 5K and 10K as well, while trying to keep up with the training.  
In hindsight I should've had more mileage per week probably.  
My HR got quite low thanks to the colder weather, so I find it somewhat hard to estimate an avg HR, but my base runs are lately around 5:20 / km with about 150HR.  
Also my overall training readiness and health was quite good beginning of July, took a 2 week holiday which broke me for a month afterwards somehow. After the holiday my whole August felt pretty meh, HRV well below avg, strength also not enough, breaks didn't help either. I kinda recovered fully in the middle of September and was able to train properly since then.

# My plan for the race:

My first and most important goal is to finish, no matter how fast. IF my first goal is met and I feel strong, I would aim for a sub 2 hour. I feel like that I might be even able to get sub 1:50, but I rather leave some on the table than to not finish because I went overly confident.

I tried to read as much as possible and came up with the following plan:  
  
Nothing fancy on the nutrition side since most people say that for a half you don't need to go fancy. I might eat a bit more pasta and such in the coming days. On the day of the race some PBJ sandwich as breakfast, little bit of coffee. My stomach tends to get quite acidic if I eat too much before the race, so I try not to overeat.

As for *clothing* I go with less, yesterday I had a run in 14¬∞C and rain / fograin and was fine, so if it rains, I skip any rain gear. I am still unsure weather to get my vest or not, but imo I go only with my usual shorts and shirt combo, and take the running belt from my wife. I'll have my phone in the back pocket for safety calls and the ability of my Garmin to send my location to my wife. Other than that only my garmin forerunner 265s and if it rains, then my random baseball cap ( I ran with it before, it is comfy).

*Nutrition during the race*:   
I am not a huge drinker, my last 14K was fine with only the 2dl water bottle during peak summer, so I try to only take the bottle. If I find myself being thirsty, I grab some from the nutri stations on the race. Since I didn't find any good salt tabs, I will mix some table salt into my water which hopefully prevents cramps and such.  
I tried 2 decathlon gels before, they were fine, but so were gummybears, so I think I take only the gummybears and eat one small pack at 40min and one at 1:20.

*Pacing:*

Since I have read, that the start can be crowded on most races, I plan to cruise around until 5km with some 6:00 - 5:40 pace and wait until the crowd thins out. I don't know if there will be any pacers on this race since this is a small one. IF there are some, I just follow the 2 hour pacer (if not, I just keep that pace) until around 15km. I am still concerned about being able to run that far since I never done that before, so I rather keep it on the safe side, and if I still feel strong at 15km, I try to go down from the 5:40 pace to around 5:00-5:20 (or even faster if the legs allow it; heck I had my 10K yesterday with 4:40 avg... I know I know, different distance, but also I obviously did not give my max yesterday)

*Post race*: I read that you need to eat properly after the race, so I might go with some burgers and fries, or a nice steak. Also hydrating properly.

*Other:* I will take vaseline with me in case it rains to lubricate delicate parts and toes. Nothin new on race day, so I only take from the nutri stations stuff if really needed. Also if I get sore or in pain, I rather try to focus on enjoying the race and the event, than to push myself to my timegoal (or at least that is what I keep saying now haha).  
  
The race is this Sunday, according to the Garmin training (which I intend to follow) I will run a short recovery run today and tomorrow (around 30min, 133HR (zone 2)), Friday off, Saturday base run with 145HR for 35min.

That's about it. I don't really have a lot of questions, rather only if I missed something or if any part of my plan is flawed / in need of adjustment.   
Imo I am in kinda good shape (though knees are misbehaving slightly, but hopefully nothing major), and my sub 2 hour goal is rather modest based on my training and the estimates, but I like to be on the safe side.

I love my parents. They‚Äôre kind, well-meaning people, but they‚Äôre hoarders. Not at the extreme level of some others, but enough that every surface of their home is covered. There are objects in every room, and not a single table or countertop is clear. Dust everywhere and grime in some spots. Things aren‚Äôt cleaned, just used. The stairs are ""clean"" in the middle but dusty along the edges, and every step has stuff stacked on the sides.

Closets and drawers are full of things that no one wants or uses, while the things they do use are kept out. They save yellowing plastic containers and lids, convinced it‚Äôll be useful someday. Everything is reused, even old plastic straws. It‚Äôs grotesque.

Growing up, I never had good-quality anything. I was sent on school hiking trips wearing rubber boots instead of proper hiking shoes. I had to go camping with a pelt as a sleeping pad. The pelt wasn‚Äôt long enough for me, it shed hair everywhere, weighed a ton, and soaked up moisture like a sponge. That was my entire childhood: third-rate, uncomfortable, ""make do."" As an adult, I‚Äôve gone the opposite way. I refuse to keep or use things I don‚Äôt need or that are poor quality. I spend a lot of (and maybe too much much) money on durable, well-made clothes and items, because I spent my childhood and a lot of my life feeling dirty. Stained, pilled clothes, surrounded by ugliness.

Cleaning in my parents' house is spotty and superficial. They save their good things, like proper cleaning cloths, and never use them. Instead, they use old socks for cleaning, and the socks are stored (like everything else) out in the open. They think hiring professionals, like carpenters, is a waste of money, even though they can afford it. Their house desperately needs repairs. Some windows have no frames because they tried to fix them themselves and gave up halfway. Instead of calling someone to finish the job, they just leave it, slowly decaying.

They also keep empty cardboard boxes from things they‚Äôve bought. These are stored inside plastic bags ""to protect them"" and now sit everywhere collecting dust. It‚Äôs impossible to clean plastic bags like this, so they're covered in dust. I've tried convincing them that they don't need these boxes, or that they could at least find a designated spot to store them in, but the cardboard boxes in plastic bags soon started taking over the house again.

I visit as often as I can and try to help. Over the years I‚Äôve painted rooms in their house, cleaned, thrown out what little I could, and even hired a cleaner to vacuum regularly. But when I stay for a few days, I feel like I barely make a difference. I get overwhelmed and end up doing very little. They‚Äôre happy when I come, and I truly love them. But I‚Äôm so ashamed of how they live and sad about the state of their home. It just feels really overwhelming, it makes me numb.

There‚Äôs so little space in their house that I can‚Äôt even keep my suitcase in the room where I sleep. I have to keep it in the living room when I visit. I end up spreading my things out on the coffee table because there‚Äôs nowhere else to put them. So temporarily I add to their mess.

My own home is tidy and organized. My parents think I go overboard and tell me that live like it‚Äôs a showroom. In actuality, it's not extreme, I just keep everything in its place and clean regularly.

1o7817k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/1o7817k/maybe_a_fun_addition_to_goodstore/,Maybe a fun addition to good.store?,"So after not following Vlogbrothers *et al*. since 2016 (life got busy), I‚Äôve recently started catching up and I am almost caught up (end of 2024 now). I saw that in one of the P4A there was a trading card perk and this got me thinking how something similar to that might be a good way to bring in some revenue for good.store. Now trading cards might be nice but to me they never gave me the sense that I am building up something or collecting something with a goal (unless it was combined with a game and then it‚Äôs a deck building exercise). That brought me to the idea of the sticker albums that were very much in trend here whenever there was a European Cup or World Cup (Panini stickers). Here's a blog that shows a bit of its history: https://stickerpedia10.blogspot.com/2021/04/history-of-panini-stickers-and-albums.html

The idea there was that you buy a sticker album (let‚Äôs say something like 15$) that is empty. Then you bought a pack of stickers (1$) that contained 5 random stickers. Or you bought a box for like 70-100$ of 100 packs for 500 stickers. Obviously, you would get duplicates etc. and that‚Äôs how they get you to spend quite a bit of money (basically loot boxes before they were a thing). Now people naturally also traded stickers or sold/bought them at events/markets etc.

I love the idea of being able to buy socks and coffee and the profits of that going to charity. But I was thinking that besides these essential goods, some fun / collectible / whimsical goods would be nice to also be able to buy after having my socks and coffee needs satisfied. That‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about the idea of a Nerdfighter Sticker Album. Especially because I believe that stickers are relatively cheap to manufacture and ship (though I could be wrong). Inside the album, there could be pages centring around Crash Course topics, P4A mascots, Vlogbrothers history, Pizzamas, journey to the microcosmos, eons, bizarre beasts, and so on.

While I am fan of the thrill you get from the random card packs, I am not a fan of a lot of people having many duplicates that they don‚Äôt know what to do with. That‚Äôs why I would propose a 2 pronged system where you have a sticker album you buy and can opt in for a subscription of stickers that costs like 5 or 10$, where you get 5 or 10 stickers a month and with that subscription, you are guaranteed to not get duplicates and after enough time you will have filled up the sticker album. One idea might be having 5 or 10 stickers per page and 12 or 24 pages so that a subscription can be for a year or two.  
For those who are ok with the possibility to pay for duplicates, the option to buy packs of random stickers still is there and with that you can then fill up your album faster. And if this is successful, new albums and stickers could come out every 2 years or so with designs for the albums and stickers also contributed by artist etc. (and although I would never call myself an artist, I‚Äôd of course be happy to contribute to the designs as well)

1o780h5,https://i.redd.it/s5j5duqyc9vf1.png,I Married The Cripple To Get Revenge,"I opened my eyes and it hit me‚ÄîI was back. Back to the day I was supposed to sign my life away to that cursed marriage contract.  
  
My past life flashed before my eyes. My cousin Summer and I were both set to marry into the filthy-rich Riches family. I was promised to Rich ""Golden Boy"" Richie, the family's pride and joy, while she got stuck with his wheelchair-bound uncle, Rich Jr.  
  
Summer begged me to swap places, but I refused. So she ditched her wedding, left Rich Jr. at the altar, and turned the whole city into her audience.  
  
Then, when I was seven months pregnant, she teamed up with my own brother, River, to cut my baby out of me. They left me to bleed out in some basement, alone and in agony.  
  
But that wasn't enough for her. Summer went full psycho, scheming her way into Richie's arms until she became the new Mrs. Rich. My father knew everything‚Äîand helped cover it up.  
  
When my mom uncovered the truth and tried to fight for me, they locked her out on the patio. She jumped. She couldn't live without me.  
  
Now here I was, alive again, staring at the same gaudy living room piled high with gold bars and glittering jewelry. My dad was practically salivating, his double chin jiggling with excitement. Marrying into the Riches family was his ticket to power in this town.  
  
My father‚Äîusually colder than ice‚Äîactually looked at me with something like approval. ""Rainy,"" he said, ""you're finally good for something.""  
  
His words sent a shiver down my spine. Wasn't I supposed to be dead? Carved open? Rotting somewhere?  
  
Before I could even catch my breath, I heard a familiar whimper behind me.  
  
""I'm so jealous of you, Rainy,"" Summer cried, clutching her chest dramatically. ""You've always had everything‚Äîa mother who loves you, and now you get to marry someone like Richie Rich. And what do I get? A cripple who can't even walk.""  
  
She wobbled like she was about to faint. Dad and River rushed to her side, fussing over her like she was made of glass.  
  
""Summer, calm down!"" River snapped, shooting me a venomous look. ""You know what the doctor said‚Äîno stress!""  
  
My mom stood off to the side, wringing her hands. She's always been too soft-hearted. River and I are her twins, the center of her world. She never could stand seeing either of us hurt.  
  
Then Summer finally choked out the question I knew was coming. ""Rainy‚Ä¶ could you please‚Ä¶ switch with me?""  
  
It felt like a punch to the gut. The same request that started it all last time.  
  
Last life, I shut her down immediately. I married Richie, got pregnant, and then Summer‚Äîwho'd gone missing after ditching her own wedding‚Äîshowed up again, green with envy. She kidnapped me, sliced me open, and killed my baby. Then she took my place as Richie's wife.  
  
They thought a double murder was bad luck, so they skipped the funeral and flushed my ashes down the toilet. When Mom tried to stop them, they locked her outside until she jumped, joining her dead daughter.  
  
While I was lost in thought, Dad and River grew impatient.  
  
""Hey! Did you hear what Summer asked you?"" River barked, raising a hand like he was about to grab my ear.  
  
But Mom stepped in front of me. ""Don't you touch my daughter.""  
  
Dad's meaty hand swung down anyway‚Äîand caught Mom across the face. His sharp nails left a long, bloody gash on her cheek.  
  
""Mom!"" I cried, cradling her face. Rage boiled inside me, but I swallowed it down.  
  
I forced a smile and made a choice‚Äîthe exact opposite of what I did before.  
  
""Sure,"" I said calmly. ""I'll switch.""  
  
Dad lowered his hand. Summer and River exchanged triumphant looks.  
  
Only Mom looked worried. ""Rainy, don't be rash,"" she whispered. ""This is your life‚Äîthink it through!""  
  
Summer clutched her chest again, turning on the waterworks. ""Auntie, how can you be so unfair? Rainy has everything! Can't she let me have just one thing?""  
  
River jumped to her defense, glaring at Mom. ""Yeah, Mom, seriously? Why can't Summer have this one thing?""  
  
Mom looked heartbroken. Her own son, taking an outsider's side over hers. She fell silent, wiping a tear away.  
  
Quietly, I pulled Mom behind me and shot River a cold glare. ""I already agreed to switch. Why are you still yelling?""  
  
River opened his mouth to argue, but Summer tugged his arm.  
  
""River,"" she said sweetly, ""help me count the gifts first.""  
  
Her eyes were locked on the gold and jewels. She didn't care about Mom. She didn't care about me. Not then, and not now.  
  
But this time‚Ä¶ things would be different.  
  
  


Chapter 2

  
  
Summer could have had all those things, but would they have truly been worth it?  
  
I knew Richie Rich better than anyone‚Äîand I knew he was bad news. If Summer wanted to suffer in my place? Fine. I'd let her.  
  
A month later, we got married on the same day.  
  
She walked down the aisle with Richie Rich, the town's golden boy. I married his disabled uncle, Rich Jr.  
  
On my wedding day, Rich Jr. wasn't able to stand and greet guests, so I faced the ceremony alone.  
  
Summer, meanwhile, floated through the crowd on Richie's arm, showered with attention and praise.  
  
My dad and my brother, River, doted on her, their faces glowing with pride. Only my mom watched me with anxious eyes, clearly worried about what my future held.  
  
It took some effort to reassure her and get her to hide her concern.  
  
Late that night, after the last of the guests had trickled out of the Rich family mansion, I found myself in the bridal suite with Rich Jr.  
  
He looked at me apologetically. ""I'm sorry you had to go through all that alone.""  
  
I just smiled, unfazed. I took hold of his wheelchair and pushed him toward the bed. ""We're married now. No need to be so formal.""  
  
He blinked, surprised. ""You're not‚Ä¶ disgusted by my condition?""  
  
I shook my head, a soft laugh escaping me. ""If I were, I wouldn't have married you.""  
  
That brought a smile to his face too.  
  
I helped him bathe and change. Later, in the king-sized bed, he took my hand, and we both drifted into a dreamless sleep.  
  
After the weddings, Summer and I both lived under the same roof at the Rich estate.  
  
While Rich Jr. and I settled into a relationship built on quiet respect, she and Richie were like a pair of rabbits in heat.  
  
Two months later, Summer announced she was pregnant.  
  
Richie and Rich Jr. happened to be out of town, so Dad and River rushed over, absolutely over the moon.  
  
If it was a boy, he'd be the first grandson‚Äîthe future heir to the Rich fortune.  
  
Dad even insisted that Mom stay behind to take care of Summer.  
  
The Rich household had more than enough staff. I didn't want my mom playing servant, so I spoke up. ""The housekeeper can look after Summer. There's no reason for Mom to stay.""  
  
Before I could finish, River stormed over like he was about to hit me. ""Rainy, you're heartless!"" he yelled. ""When I was drowning as a kid, you didn't lift a finger to save me! Now Summer needs help, and you're just being selfish!""  
  
""How are we even related?""  
  
I was stunned.  
  
I'd never understood why he hated me so much. Now it finally made sense.  
  
He thought I'd stood by and done nothing when he was drowning‚Äîthat it was Summer who had saved him.  
  
But the truth was, I was the one who dragged him to shore. When I tried to climb out, the current pulled me downstream.  
  
He woke up with Summer by his side and assumed she was his rescuer.  
  
So in his eyes, I was heartless‚Äîand a clumsy fool.  
  
It was a stupid misunderstanding, one that could've been cleared up if he'd ever bothered to ask. But I was done explaining. If he wanted to hate me, so be it.  
  
  


Chapter 3

  
  
River's face flushed crimson with rage.  
  
Summer latched onto his arm. ""River, please, take me to look at the jewelry. I want to wear something new,"" she cooed.  
  
She was completely oblivious to my feelings‚Äîshe didn't even glance my way.  
  
My mother stood there in silence. I took her hand and gently led her out of the house.  
  
We settled onto the sofa together, and Mom looked like she was struggling to find the right words.  
  
I cut her off gently and handed her a thick folder.  
  
Confused, she took it. ""What's this, Rainy?""  
  
""Open it,"" I urged.  
  
Her hands began to shake as she pulled out the photographs. She looked as if she might tear them to shreds right then and there.  
  
The pictures were of my father and her deceased sister. The truth was staggering: Dad had been having an affair with his sister-in-law even before he met my mother.  
  
Everything suddenly made sense. That's why my own father had always treated my cousin better than me.  
  
It turned out she wasn't my cousin at all‚Äîshe was my half-sister.  
  
I had gathered this evidence myself, knowing I had to tell Mom.  
  
She broke down, crying and laughing almost hysterically. She was over fifty years old, and her whole world had just shattered.  
  
After a few moments, Mom stood up, went to the bathroom, washed her face, and carefully applied her makeup. Then, she headed back downstairs, her posture firm.  
  
I followed, ready to support her. She offered a strained smile to the three of them. ""Honey, River, you can go home now. I'll take care of Summer.""  
  
Dad and River exchanged bewildered looks, but Summer was beaming.  
  
Mom understood. Summer was doing all this to get back at her own mother.  
  
Mom simply smiled back, and the three of them ended up staying.  
  
Over the following weeks, Mom waited on Summer hand and foot, while Summer yelled and complained constantly. The food was too hot, then too cold‚Äîbut Mom followed every command without a word of protest.  
  
Summer seemed thrilled. Within three months, she had ballooned to two hundred pounds. She probably thought she was happy‚Äîher figure was ruined, but she was finally pregnant.  
  
She insisted Mom accompany her to every doctor's appointment, just to flaunt the pregnancy.  
  
But at the three-month checkup, Summer went alone. When she returned, she was white as a ghost and locked herself in her room, skipping dinner entirely.  
  
Mom and I knew she was hiding something.  
  
The next day, Summer was suddenly all smiles. She invited me for tea to apologize‚Äîpointedly excluding Mom. I knew it was a trap, but I went anyway, determined to uncover her secret.  
  
""Rainy, I was wrong. I truly hope you can forgive me,"" Summer said, pushing a cup toward me.  
  
I didn't touch it.  
  
She wouldn't let up. ""These coffee beans are imported. Please, just one sip, Rainy."" Then she started sobbing dramatically.  
  
The sudden silence in the room made everyone stare at me as if I were the villain.  
  
Just to end the scene, I finally took a small sip. ""Are you happy now?"" I asked coldly.  
  
A triumphant grin flashed across Summer's face before she left.  
  
I rushed straight to the hospital, but suddenly, a hand clamped over my mouth, and I was dragged into a dark alley. I couldn't scream.  
  
A burning heat spread from my stomach through my entire body. I couldn't believe it‚Äîshe had drugged my drink.  
  
A man with a foul stench started touching my face. I shuddered, trying to break free, but the drug made my limbs feel like lead.  
  
Just as I thought it was all over, a figure shot into the alley and sent the man flying with a powerful kick.  
  
I stared in shock as Rich Jr. pummeled my attacker. ""You‚Ä¶ you can stand?!"" I stammered.  
  
He didn't answer. Instead, he called someone to clean up the mess, then helped me into his car. My face was on fire; the drug was taking over, blurring my vision. All I could see was the sheen of sweat on his neck.  
  
Rich Jr. swallowed hard. ""Don't move. We're going home.""  
  
All I could think about was paying him back for saving me.  
  
After that incident, Summer kept inviting me out, but I knew she was up to no good. I rejected her every time.

My husband Cam went straight to the shower.

His phone buzz from inside his briefcase and I fished it out. There were Lacey's texts.

‚ÄúYou looked so se-xy tonight, I almost did something in front of the clients that would have landed me in front of HR.‚Äù

My hands shook. I scrolled higher.

‚ÄúOh my God, Cam that look you gave me in the elevator this morning... let's just say my panties were soaked.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's only fair since your ti-ts in that blouse... I was hard as a rock. I had to take care of myself in the men's room before I could even make it to my office.‚Äù

I stopped breathing a little.

My husband wasn't just out of love with me; he was cheating. With his sectary.

The hurt was just as sharp as the fear, trapping me between resentment and heartbreak, like a pinball caught bouncing in every direction. Around and around.

I stood as still and silent as a stone.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

My cheeks stung with hot shame as a stray tear was brushed away‚Äîhumiliation at nearly breaking down in public. Cameron's hand found mine, fingers curling in a steady, grounding squeeze. """"It's going to be alright,"""" he whispered. """"We're finally going to get some answers."""" The word answers had the taste of a sentence, not a solution. Four miscarriages, stretched over six years, pointed to something unfixable. Something in me.

Before Cameron and I said our vows, he'd already spun elaborate stories of what our future would look like. A boy, breaking in a battered mitt, chasing fly balls in the backyard. A daughter swirling past in ballet tights, maybe a pageant sash, blond curls drifting, or maybe a dark-headed, stubborn child with Cam's determined jaw. He used to talk about it with his eyes gone soft, happy lights flickering behind them. I saw it, too, after a while. The softness of a little head under my palm; small hands and puzzle pieces and laughter echoing down the hallway.

Cameron had grown up alone. Only child, moving from city to city on the back of his father's military orders. He didn't talk about it much, but sometimes I'd catch the way the empty house seemed to press on him when we came home late and there was nobody waiting. It made sense, after that, how he craved siblings for our kids, how he wanted noise and chaos where he'd grown up with only silence.

We dated two years, got married, and he was ready the next minute to start a family. I'd finished college, but my dreams always seemed to slip and change: law, then nursing, then teaching. Each idea glimmered for a while, until another turned my head. Cam teased me, saying I was too much of a free spirit, that kids would finally anchor me. He wanted a house full of laughter and messes and a wife who stayed close, just the opposite of his own mother's constant absences and the rotating door of babysitters and housekeepers. I agreed. It sounded safe. No one ever warned me how quickly trying could become a mountain to climb.

When I saw the first two pink lines on a strip of plastic, I thought my heart would burst. It took six months after our wedding, and from the moment I told Cam he started buying things: onesies, a crib, little booties. He had hope that filled our whole house. But sorrow showed up before the first ultrasound. """"It happens sometimes,"""" the hospital staff said gently, """"no reason to worry."""" But the seed had been planted. Worry took root.

The second time happened nearly a year later, ending at ten weeks. Again, """"one of those things."""" By the third time, Dr. Wash recommended a whole panel of tests. I hesitated. Denial was easier than facing what might be lurking underneath. But Cam was unraveling, even if he tried to hide it. With the third pregnancy, every errand, every twinge in my body, felt dangerous. The fourth time, I barely left bed. Still, the bleeding started. My voice was shaking when I called Cam. He said """"I'm on my way,"""" but I could already hear how his heart was breaking. At the hospital, when his tears finally fell, I couldn't hold myself together anymore. I gave in. I agreed to the tests.

The next six months blurred: appointments, scans, blood draws, pokes and prods that left me raw and empty. We sat in Dr. Wash's office, twenty minutes past our time. The clock on her wall seemed to get louder every minute. My nerves were a live wire. When she came in, she was holding a clipboard, clutched to her chest, her face drawn down in a tired frown. She didn't say anything at first. That told me plenty.

""""Sorry for the wait,"""" she said, sliding the clipboard onto her desk. """"It's been a hectic morning."""" She scanned the sheet. """"I've looked at all your tests."""" Her voice dropped lower, heavier.

""""Cameron, your spe-rm count is lower than average, but not by much. Obviously, that's not the main issue, since Olivia has conceived four times. It's the carrying-to-term that's the problem.""""

Cam's jaw clenched. """"Do you know why it keeps happening?""""

She pushed the clipboard to the side, folding her hands. """"It's complicated. Multiple things, actually. We harvested some eggs, Olivia, both for testing and for IVF if you want to try that.""""

I nodded. """"We talked about that, yes.""""

""""The egg count is lower than we'd expect for your age. In fact, the fact you got pregnant four times is almost lucky.""""

My question burst out before I could stop it. """"Why would it be so low?""""

She shrugged. """"Could be genetics. But the embryo quality, across all the samples, was poor. Either Cameron's spe-rm or your eggs‚ÄîI can't say which for sure, maybe both‚Äîcarry abnormalities that affect viability. And with your bicornuate uterus, miscarriage risks go up. Hormonal imbalances, too, but those are more treatable.""""

Cam squeezed my hand, his knuckles white. """"So, what does all that mean? Could we ever have a child?""""

Dr. Wash smiled, gently, but her eyes looked sad. """"There are ways to become parents besides natural conception. Surrogacy is a good option‚Äîthe egg and spe-rm issues aren't ideal, but a surrogate could make it more likely for a pregnancy to stick. Or adoption, if that's something you're open to.""""

Cam pressed, leaning in. """"Why not IVF?""""

Dr. Wash shook her head. """"Odds are very low. The poor egg quality and your history make success unlikely. I can't say it's impossible, but it's not promising.""""

The words knocked the breath out of me even though, deep down, I'd already known. I looked across at Cam, and he was stone-still. I realized, then, how long he'd let himself hope.

Dr. Wash offered us a business card. """"This surrogacy program is reputable. If you want to meet, they're right here in the building. No hurry, but egg viability does decline, so time is a consideration.""""

Cam accepted the card and helped me to my feet, guiding me with his hand pressed close at the small of my back. """"Thank you,"""" he said, voice rough.

The doctor smiled again, softer this time. """"You'd be wonderful parents, whichever path you take. If adoption is of interest, I can refer a good agency.""""

""""We'll think about it,"""" Cam said.

Out in the hallway, the silence felt heavier than before. The question hanging between us: Would this be the crack that split us, in the end? Would Cam decide there was nothing left for him here? I couldn't shake that fear. With Cam, I felt safe. I couldn't bear the idea of losing him and the future all in one stroke.

We drove home in total silence. I watched the side of Cam's face as he drove, searching for some sign of what he was thinking, while my own mind spiraled. We pulled into our driveway; the house we'd bought for the family we'd never have. Five bedrooms, every inch picked out for kids. Walking inside felt like stepping into a crypt. I remembered Cam carrying me over the threshold, laughing about who would get each bedroom, his dreams splintering in my memory.

Inside, Cam went straight to the bar in the living room and poured himself scotch. """"Want one?"""" He didn't look my way, but I shook my head. He finished it in one gulp and poured another.

After that, I couldn't hold it in anymore. The tears came fast, unstoppable. Cam was instantly at my side, kneeling to wrap his arms around me, holding me together when I was sure I'd fall apart. """"Don't cry,"""" he said. """"We'll get through this. I promise. There's nothing we can't do together.""""

I choked out, """"I can't give you what you need. It's always been your dream to have a family. You even talked about it on our third date.""""

He stroked my back, slow and reassuring. """"You're everything I need. If I have you, that's enough.""""

I was almost afraid to ask the next part‚Äîthe words barely left my mouth. """"You'll never leave me?""""

He tipped my chin up so our eyes met. His were shining, green and steady. """"I would never leave you. You're my heart. With or without children. As long as you're here, I am home.""""

My voice shook with the last question. """"Could you really be happy, if we never have a child?""""

His answer was simple, fierce. """"With you? I already am.""""

One Year Later

Tonight, I wanted everything to be perfect. The quiet kitchen was a cathedral, sunlight slanting through my own nervousness, and then‚Äîa sharp yelp broke the hush as my hand caught the edge of the oven's hot glass. Reflex saved me from a real burn, but my fingertip smarted, angry and red, pressed up to my lips. Sucking at it did nothing, but it made me feel like I was doing something, like I was fixing the mistake.

A soft hum escaped me, shaky, as I started pulling plates from the cabinet above the sink. Each one went down on the table like it was made of gold, every curve lined up, every glass glinting and flawless. Even the tiniest slant made my heart lurch. It had to be perfect. Especially tonight, of all nights.

Cam had been talking about the merger for weeks. Some huge company. World-changing, or at least it felt that way for him. Today was supposed to be the day‚Äîthe day everything was official. This dinner was meant to be a celebration. Expansion, hundreds of new hires, a future full of """"imagine the possibilities."""" Only, it all sounded so big and far away, like every new success in his world just yanked him further out of reach, like the universe pulling loose from its own gravity.

Job hunting felt pointless now. My email was clogged with applications, all blending together in their bland, polite rejections. Thirty-one years old and nothing but a general degree and a few college coffee shop shifts. It made me feel small, invisible. Cam never pressed, never asked for details, just pictured a wife who was happy to stay home and play house, stuck in some dreamy old movie version of marriage.

And then there was the thing we didn't talk about. Surrogacy. Adoption. Two words that had become a deep, echoing gap. We'd start to talk about adoption, and Cam's phone would ring. """"Work emergency."""" Or suddenly, he'd steer the conversation off the edge of a cliff. More emergencies meant more late nights, more trips, more missing weekends. Seasons shifted, months fell off the calendar, and the reassurance I needed just never came.

It hadn't always been like this. After that diagnosis, we held onto each other tight. There were midnight whispers, lazy hugs in the morning, little plans for getaways that never made it past the dreaming stage. One by one, work snuffed them out. Our time together shrank, like wax burning down to nothing. Each unanswered call left me a little more hollow.

Dinner was beautiful, at least. The roast was perfect, carrots and onions caramelized to gold, the mashed potatoes like clouds, asparagus crisp and green on the plate. Peach cobbler for dessert, sticky and sweet, filling the house with a promise. Cam's favorites, all lined up. The clock was almost at six.

I poured the wine, checked my phone, glanced at the door. Waiting had its own ache. The phone flickered with battery checks and hope. Just one buzz, any sign he'd be home soon.

Instead, Rachel's bubbly text:

We need a girl's night, girl!

I winced. Honestly, I'd let our friendship rust. Worrying about Cam, about everything, had eaten up all my space for other relationships.

I sent back: This weekend?

Scrolling social media was a mistake. Every couple looked like a magazine ad: perfect smiles, perfect connection. Those memories with Cam felt faded, like they belonged to someone else's life‚Äînot mine anymore. I sipped the wine and waited, and the clock crawled.

6:15. He was never late without a word. I refreshed my messages. Nothing. Not from Cam, anyway. Rachel again: Yes! We can go to that new club across town.

I wanted to laugh. I texted a quick """"Alrighty,"""" but my head was still back at the table, still waiting for the click of Cam's key in the door.

The roast smelled amazing, but my stomach was a knot. What if the merger had gone badly? What if something had happened? Social media was no comfort; every post just stung. I sipped again. Watched the sun bleed out, the dusk swallow the house. No headlights. No Cam.

Once more, I checked my phone. Still nothing. I tried not to panic, tried to play it cool. I texted: Are you on your way home yet? and set the phone down, my hand shaking just a little.

Minutes spun by in a hush. The wall clock kept ticking, but it sounded far away. When the phone buzzed, my heart jumped. Rachel again.

Yes! We can get dressed up and dance all night!

If only. Clubs felt like another world now. I typed a quick response, tried to picture stilettos and tight dresses, but that Olivia felt like someone I'd met once at a party and never seen again.

No car out front. No sign of Cam. The silence pressed in tighter.

I finally caved and called his cell. Three rings, then voicemail. The dread wasn't small anymore. He'd seen it was me. Why not pick up? I left a message, my voice thin:

""""Hey, baby. Didn't say you'd be late, dinner's ready. Call if you can‚Äîlove you.""""

The silence after was heavier than before. I drained my glass and poured another. Tried reading, but the words slipped away. The characters' drama felt paper-thin compared to my own.

Nine o'clock struck, sharp as a slap. I dialed Cam's work line, but nobody answered. Panic started to creep in, cold and slow. I called Janet, the secretary who'd been his right hand for years. Surely, Janet would know.

But an old woman's voice answered, softer than I remembered. Retired. Five months ago. She hadn't even said goodbye.

My stomach dropped. Lacey. The new name. I copied down the number with a shaking hand, feeling almost embarrassed. How had Cam not told me this?

When I called, the background was loud, like a party‚Äîor a restaurant, utensils against plates. A young woman answered, bright and efficient:

""""Hello?""""

""""Hi, Olivia here. Cam's wife. Is this Lacey?"""" My voice sounded too small.

""""Yes, I'm Lacey. You said you're Cam's wife?""""

""""Yes. He was supposed to be home at six. I can't get him on the phone. Have you heard from him?""""

A pause. """"No, I'm sorry. He left the office at the usual time. Haven't seen him since.""""

""""Could you call me if you hear anything?"""" I hated how worried I sounded, but it bubbled up anyway.

""""Sure thing. I'm sure he's just out for a drink or something.""""

""""Thanks.""""

I hung up, poured another glass, and just sat. What was there to do? I could drive around, but that seemed more desperate than waiting right here. Besides, what if he came home and I wasn't here? So I curled up on the couch, wrapped myself in a blanket, and let the wine soften the edges of my anxiety.

I must have nodded off, because the next thing I felt was a nudge against my arm. I groaned awake, blinking into the darkness before I shot up like a lightning bolt.

""""Whoa there, Nelly. Slow down before you hurt yourself."""" Cam's voice was hoarse with exhaustion, but there was laughter in it too.

He stood by the couch, backlit by the hall light, tie loosened, suit all creased. Not relief on his face, just weariness.

""""What time is it?"""" I managed, the words sticking to my tongue.

""""Midnight. You must have crashed."""" He shrugged out of his jacket and dropped it over a chair.

""""I was waiting for you. I called, I texted..."""" I trailed off, too tired to sound upset.

""""Sorry, baby. My phone was off most of the night. Meeting ran late. We wrapped up the merger, finally.""""

I wanted to feel happy for him. It was supposed to be good news. But all I could see was the untouched dinner, cold on the table. And all I could feel was my heart, beating too fast.

""""I didn't know. I made you dinner.""""

He noticed then‚Äîthe plates, the candles, the roses that looked silly now in the cold light. """"I'm so sorry. It just... got away from me. Lacey's a machine, honestly. She got me through a mountain of paperwork tonight. Janet was great, but she was, you know..."""" He winced. """"She moved a little slower in the end. Lacey's really on top of things.""""

My mouth went dry. """"So Janet retired?""""

He blinked, caught off guard. """"Oh. Yeah. I thought I told you that.""""

""""No. I called her tonight when I couldn't find you. She said she hadn't heard from you since you left the office.""""

He started clearing plates with me, moving almost automatically, the words falling into the silence like crumbs.

""""She lied. Lacey. Why would she tell me she hadn't seen you?""""

He froze, then gave a half-shrug, like it didn't really matter. """"You called Lacey?""""

""""I did.""""

Pause. A glance. """"She's just efficient, does what she needs to do. I'll ask her about it in the morning. Not a big deal.""""

A sourness twisted in my gut, almost bitter. """"Is she pretty?""""

That finally drew a laugh, a weary half-grin. """"Is my beautiful wife jealous?""""

""""Not jealous,"""" I said, fighting to keep my voice steady. """"Just... concerned. Should I be?""""

He stepped close, arms wrapping around me. """"I love you. None of that matters."""" His lips brushed my hair, the words warm but not quite enough to settle the ache.

I nodded, too tired to argue. It was easier this way. We finished up, the clatter of plates and silverware the only noise. We got ready for bed, both pretending that nothing was wrong. Maybe tomorrow there would be answers‚Äîor more questions.

In the dark, I closed my eyes and let the worries swirl away, just for a little while. Maybe if I wished hard enough, everything would be fine. Maybe I could sleep until the sun came up, and maybe in the morning, Cam would still be here. Maybe I'd finally get the truth.

But for now, it was enough just to pretend.

The morning arrived with lances of sunlight, jabbing through the half-drawn blinds to dapple the tangled sheets. Cam's side of the bed was already abandoned, only a faint impression of warmth left behind and sheets wound around my hips like the memory of a touch. My head pounded with the dull complaint of too much cheap wine the night before, and my tongue felt thick, my entire mouth stale as if I'd chewed a wad of cotton overnight.

I could hear the shower running from the master bath, the muted hiss tapping a steady rhythm. That was Cam's way: out of bed before me, quick jog, then a shower. He'd towel off, hair dripping, then wander out for his coffee‚Äîwhich I always had waiting. His phone rested on the nightstand, jittering with a soft buzz. I flopped to my side and tried to blink away the fog, peeking at the screen: a text, right after six in the morning. Curiosity nudged me. I stretched for it, but the lock screen blinked irritably, needing a password.

Lacey, the screen read in bold letters. His assistant. Probably just a last-minute change at work; nothing dramatic. Except, why so early? My heartbeat skipped strangely as I eased myself up and tiptoed toward the door, trailing my husband's oversized slippers.

Cam was in the doorway, toweling himself briskly, steam swirling around his shoulders and chest. He had another towel slung low on his hips, water trickling down his neck. He barely glanced at me. """"What are you doing?""""

""""You got a text,"""" I said, doing my best to keep my voice even. """"When did your phone start needing a password?""""

He grinned sheepishly, the lines at the corners of his mouth deepening. """"We had a bunch of break-ins at the building last week. They said to secure everything. My whole life is on there, you know? Can't be too careful."""" He reached for the phone, and I handed it over, my fingers brushing his for a split second.

He checked it, shrugged, and pocketed it again. """"Nothing important. Lacey gets nervous about schedules. I'll fix it at work.""""

I tried to leave it at that, but my next words stuck a little. """"Could we maybe have a date night tomorrow? Saturday? It's been forever since we did anything just the two of us.""""

He raised his eyebrows in surprise as he buttoned his crisp shirt, every move so smooth I could almost fall for him all over again. The fabric stretched across his chest, pulling just slightly over muscle and bone. My cheeks felt hot, but I kept talking.

""""I've got a pile of work, but I can clear my schedule for my girl,"""" he said after a moment. """"Dinner and a movie?""""

I couldn't help the way my grin nearly split my face. """"Perfect. I'll plan something.""""

He laughed, slipping into his sneakers. """"Coffee?""""

""""Yes, please!"""" I scrambled after him, tripping on the sheets at my feet, feeling a hint of hope spark to life.

‚àû‚àû‚àû

The job hunt had turned into a long, endless string of 'Thanks, but no thanks.' Too qualified, not qualified enough, not the right fit. I'd tried everywhere: offices, stores, anything. Every rejection left the word 'unwanted' stamped a little deeper on my resume.

I came out of a fancy law office, the kind with marble floors and too-bright lights, feeling smaller than ever. The sidewalk was already shimmering with heat, storefronts lined tidy along the block, mannequins blank-faced and unwelcoming.

Something bright caught my eye. In the window, an ancient typewriter gleamed, its brass body and green glass keys so beautiful I almost pressed my nose to the glass. The sign above it read Timeless Treasures. I couldn't help but step inside.

A bell above the door jingled, and suddenly I was wrapped in the cozy scent of roasted coffee and dusty, sun-warmed paper. The wood floor moaned under every careful step. Shelves towered overhead, full of battered novels. Here and there, clocks ticked in sync, their brass hands marking quiet hours. I saw china teacups and faded armchairs tucked into shadowy nooks.

I ran my fingers across the spines of weathered books, breathing in old stories and wood polish. At the back, a sign pointed 'Fantasy' and I drifted there, drawn to covers splashed with dragons and swirling fog and silver-edged swords. Two books called to me‚Äîa deep blue one with gold script, another covered in crushed green velvet‚Äîand I clutched them close.

""""Hi there, young lady,"""" a voice called out. I turned and found a gentle-faced man smiling at me from behind the counter. Pale silver hair, skin creased kindly. He looked about seventy, but his eyes were bright and quick.

""""I'm never on this side of the city,"""" I admitted, """"but that beautiful typewriter in the window sucked me in.""""

""""Oh, that! She's a beauty, isn't she? Been around since..."""" He tapped his chin, peering toward the ceiling, """"1925, maybe. Give or take a year.""""

""""So it's a bookshop and an antique shop?"""" I asked.

""""That's right, but we've got the best coffee in the city, too,"""" he said, holding up his own cup. """"A book with no coffee is like wine without cheese.""""

I smiled, even if I didn't agree. I never liked cheese much, and people always seemed to add cheese to every metaphor.

""""Are you the manager?"""" I asked, still curious.

He came out from behind the counter and offered his hand. """"Richard Porter. I own the place. Glad you stopped by.""""

His shake was warm and sturdy. """"Olivia,"""" I said, """"It's nice to meet you.""""

""""So, Olivia, what kind of java do you prefer?""""

I shrugged. """"Americano, if I'm being honest.""""

He seemed to approve. """"A true classic. I'll whip one up for you. Go ahead, look around.""""

""""Thanks,"""" I said, a little surprised but oddly pleased. He disappeared behind the counter, and I wandered the aisles, soaking up the sleepy-morning light and tracing the dust motes as they spun in sunbeams. The aroma of fresh coffee filled the whole room.

When I returned, there was a tall, black coffee steaming on the counter. I wrapped both hands around it, letting the warmth chase the chill out of my skin. First sip: bold and bitter, like I liked it sometimes when I needed a real pick me up.

He rang up my books, but waved away the extra for coffee. """"Welcome gift,"""" he insisted. """"Everyone deserves a lucky morning.""""

His kindness clung to me all the way out the door, my books safe in my bag and the cup warming my palm. For the first time in weeks, I felt almost hopeful. The city outside seemed friendlier, everything touched with gold.""

I fit the last pin into my hair, the strands twisted up tight, and gave my reflection a long, critical look. Cam always said I looked beautiful with my hair up, and if there was any night I wanted to look my best for him, it was tonight. I‚Äôd picked out a cute little summer dress with tiny straps barely wide enough to stay on my shoulders, and a pair of strappy heels that made my calves pop just so. The restaurant I‚Äôd chosen wasn‚Äôt anything fancy‚Äîa little local joint with cozy booths and dim lights, just relaxed enough that I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about knocking over a water glass or Cam rolling his eyes at the menu. Then, to top it off, I‚Äôd snagged tickets to an action movie I didn‚Äôt even like, just because I knew Cam would. Romance was more my thing, but maybe if I showed some flexibility, something would shift between us. Maybe if I let him lead a little, he‚Äôd start wanting to spend time with me again, and it wouldn‚Äôt always feel like I was dragging him out with promises of candlelight and white tablecloths.

Second hoop earring slipped in, check. I grabbed my phone off the vanity, then padded to the living room and perched on the edge of the couch, checking the clock every time I blinked. We didn‚Äôt need a reservation; it was that sort of place, the kind you actually just walked into. But the movie had a set start time, so I‚Äôd told Cam we needed to leave by five. He‚Äôd gone to work earlier that morning‚Äîa quick errand, he‚Äôd said‚Äîand I hadn‚Äôt heard a word from him since. Now it was pushing 4:30, and I could feel that sick nervous flutter in my stomach.

Are you on your way? I texted him.

Time ticked by, minute hand rolling over and over before my screen finally lit up, 4:40.

Sorry, got caught up. I‚Äôm coming now.

Except he didn‚Äôt just come. It was a full thirty minutes before I heard the door open and Cam walked in, tossing his briefcase onto the nearest chair and yanking at his tie like it was choking him.

‚ÄúSorry I‚Äôm late,‚Äù he said, not even glancing in my direction. ‚ÄúThings were crazy at the office.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt leave now, we‚Äôll miss the movie,‚Äù I said, shooting to my feet.

He pulled out his phone, checked something, and started shrugging off his jacket. ‚ÄúCan I just go like this?‚Äù He didn‚Äôt wait for an answer, already rolling up his sleeves, the crisp dress shirt and slacks from work the same as what he‚Äôd left in that morning.

I tried not to let the disappointment show. ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I said, grabbing my purse and trailing him to the car.

The ride was silent. Cam drove like he was already halfway somewhere else, jaw set, eyes squinting into traffic, his famous frown creased deep across his brow. I fidgeted in my seat, wanting to ask what was wrong, but even I knew better by now. If he wanted to talk, he‚Äôd talk. If not, there was nothing I could do but wait it out.

He didn‚Äôt touch me on the way into the restaurant. Gone was the hand on my lower back, the fingers brushing my palm. I walked beside a stranger, a man-shaped shadow. The hostess was blonde and polished, her smile stretching wide and eager for my husband, never even flicking my way. That wasn‚Äôt new; Cam had always drawn the eyes. But tonight, instead of ignoring it, he smiled right back. Not the small, sheepish one he sometimes gave when he caught me watching, but a wide, confident grin, like flirting with a complete stranger was the easiest, most natural thing in the world.

I wanted to throw something at him. I wanted to ask him why it was so hard to look at me that way, but so easy to turn it on for someone he‚Äôd just met. I followed behind the two of them, feeling like a ghost at my own date night.

He slid into the booth across from me and snapped his napkin open, settling it into his lap. The hostess gave him one more blinding smile before she left.

‚ÄúShe was friendly,‚Äù I said, voice flat.

Cam didn‚Äôt even look up from his menu. ‚ÄúJealous is a new look on you, Livi. I don‚Äôt think I like it much.‚Äù

I shrugged, refusing to give him the satisfaction. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs jealous?‚Äù

He went back to reading, not bothering to answer. I was relieved when the waiter turned out to be a guy; at least I wouldn‚Äôt have to watch another woman fall all over Cam while he basked in it.

‚ÄúWhat can I get you to drink tonight? Wine? Water?‚Äù the waiter asked.

‚ÄúWater for me, please. I think I‚Äôll skip the wine.‚Äù

‚ÄúWater for me too,‚Äù Cam said, ‚Äúand a scotch on the rocks.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes sir. Are you ready to order or do you need a minute?‚Äù

Cam peered at me over his menu.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready.‚Äù I offered the waiter a tiny smile. ‚ÄúShrimp scampi, please.‚Äù

‚ÄúLobster bisque.‚Äù Cam handed back his menu, efficient and brusque.

The waiter barely had time to step away before Cam‚Äôs phone lit up and pinged. He checked it, thumbed a reply with practiced speed, shoved the phone aside. The screen went dark.

I burned to ask, but I didn‚Äôt want to seem clingy or suspicious. Still, I couldn‚Äôt stop myself.

‚ÄúSo, work on a Saturday?‚Äù I forced my tone light. ‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù

He scowled. ‚ÄúJust trying to get everything in order with the merger. Moving into the bigger space has been a nightmare.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh? I haven‚Äôt seen your new office yet. Can I come up on Monday?‚Äù

Cam hesitated, blinking once, just long enough for me to notice. ‚ÄúUh, yeah, maybe. It‚Äôs not completely set up yet.‚Äù

The words were out before I even thought about them: ‚ÄúIs Lacey‚Äôs office close to yours?‚Äù

His whole face darkened. ‚ÄúShe has a desk right outside my office. Just like she did at the old building. And just like Janet had.‚Äù Every syllable was sharp and irritated.

The waiter came with the drinks and I gratefully took a long sip of ice water, letting it cool my face. I tried, I really did, but silence crashed between us again.

‚ÄúSo I bought tickets to that new action movie you said looked interesting,‚Äù I tried again, latching onto something positive.

He grunted. ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

I slumped in my seat. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have bothered. He didn‚Äôt reach for my hand, didn‚Äôt even look at me. I swallowed, tried one more time.

‚ÄúIs everything okay, Cam?‚Äù It came out before I could stop myself. ‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ are we okay? You haven‚Äôt seemed yourself lately. Things have been‚Ä¶ different.‚Äù

His phone buzzed again. He checked it, typed out something longer, then dropped it face down on the table and finally looked at me, eyes heavy. He sighed like it physically hurt.

‚ÄúYes, Livi, everything is fine. I know I‚Äôve been a little distant, I‚Äôm just going through some stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want to talk about it?‚Äù

He shook his head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll work it out and things will go back to normal eventually.‚Äù

I wanted to press, but his face was a wall. I knew better than to keep at it.

I reached for his hand across the table, but the moment didn‚Äôt last. ‚ÄúI love you, Cam. I really do.‚Äù

He looked at me, surprise flickering across his face. ‚ÄúI love you too, Livi. Always.‚Äù

Dinner was quiet but at least the food was good. The shrimp had just the right bite, and Cam made short work of his lobster bisque. I was just about to ask if he wanted dessert when his phone rang, so loud it seemed to echo off the glassware. Before I could even react, Cam snatched it up, and I caught the name before the screen disappeared: Lacey.

Of course.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I have to take this.‚Äù He stood and answered on the move, heading for the restrooms without even a backwards glance.

I exhaled a long sigh. The waiter swooped in to clear the plates, and I waved off dessert. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm done. Just the check, thanks.‚Äù

Cam came back a few minutes later, face drawn, but he didn‚Äôt quite meet my eyes as he sat down.

‚ÄúLivi‚Ä¶‚Äù he started.

‚ÄúLet me guess. Work emergency?‚Äù My voice was thin and tired.

He reached out, briefly, fingers grazing my chin. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make it up to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I whispered.

He was already getting up, pulling out his wallet. ‚ÄúGo see the movie. Have a good time and I‚Äôll see you later tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou promise you‚Äôll make it up to me?‚Äù I tried for a playful smile, even as my heart sank.

He smirked, finally, just a hint of the old Cam. ‚ÄúOf course, baby.‚Äù

‚ÄúTonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you want. I may be late.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait up.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt. But okay.‚Äù He k1ssed me on the forehead, quick and soft. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you later. I‚Äôm going to take an Uber so you can have the car.‚Äù

I nodded, numb. ‚ÄúHave fun, babe.‚Äù

The waiter dropped the bill and his eyebrows nearly hit the ceiling when I left the full tip Cam had laid out. He thanked me twice and I mustered a small smile, glad at least someone‚Äôs evening was going well.

I'm heading to your beautiful city for the first time ever, and I'll only be there for a week.  I'm really hoping to meet some locals and get a true feel for the city, beyond the main tourist spots!

The thing is... I'm pretty shy and honestly find it hard to make the first move with strangers. I don't think I can just walk up to someone at a bar and start chatting, haha.

So, a couple of questions for you locals:

Any recommendations for low-pressure, friendly places to go? Think casual meetups, or a specific chill pub/cafe that's known for being easy to strike up a conversation in? Any kind of class or workshop (cooking, etc.) that's super welcoming to newcomers?

Or... is anyone here interested in a casual chat? If you're local and also looking to make a new friend for a coffee, a walk on the beach, or a quick drink during my week stay, please feel free to send me a DM! I'd love to chat and see if we click, and maybe even meet up if we're comfortable.

I recently visited Stockholm for the first time with my brother, and we ended up sitting down in Gamla Stan at a place called Cafe Choklad. The place already seemed dodgy but we honestly didn't think it could be any worse than just poor value. Obviously we were wrong, and we were scammed out of 40 euros for 2 coffees and 3 pastries.

This is not a rant post - we laughed this off after letting the owner know what we thought. Only then did we look at the Google Maps rating and it was 1.4 - probably the lowest score I have ever seen for a business across 40+ countries.

Obviously the place is a tourist trap, but it was actually comedic how far apart the value and price tag of our snack was. I wanted to know whether any locals have an insight into how this place has managed to stay open (and presumably turn a profit) for years, and whether there is an interesting story to why it operates like this. It was straight out of a sitcom.

It was so ridiculous that it was, and still is, quite hilarious to think about - but I've never been ripped off quite so shamelessly - so it's really piqued my interest in the owner and its history.

1o77syd,https://i.redd.it/t9vr9mcsa9vf1.png,The Jones Heiress Strikes Back | My Husband's Secret Daughter Was Diagnosed,"Last time, my husband's secret daughter was diagnosed with acute leukemia. When it came time for a bone marrow transplant, he secretly took her in for the procedure. Her heart gave out mid-surgery. She died on the operating table at just four years old.  
  
By the time I reached the hospital, all that was left for me to hold was my little girl's ice-cold body.  
  
My husband just rolled his eyes at my tears. ""It's not like she was going to make it anyway. If her marrow can help someone else, then good for her. Karma, right? Maybe she'll get a better shot in her next life.""  
  
I wanted to tear his face off.  
  
He shoved me back and kicked me. ""This is your fault, you useless mother! You couldn't even give her a healthy body. You're both cursed!""  
  
That was it. I'd had enough. I grabbed him, and we went out the window‚Äîsixteen stories down.  
  
Then I woke up. Back on my engagement day. Right then and there, I called my dad. ""Dad, I'm not marrying Scott. Please switch the business deal to his brother instead.""  
  
Let's see how Scott and that tramp manage without me.  
  
I hung up, my hands still shaking. The memory of my daughter's cold skin was burned into my mind. Sixteen stories‚Ä¶ then boom. I was back in the bridal suite.  
  
The party hadn't even started. I pulled myself together, snatched my dress, and got out of that room.  
  
As soon as I stepped into the hall, I heard them.  
  
""Scott, it's your engagement party. This isn't right. Miranda's right next door.""  
  
Scott's voice was rough, post-sex. ""Relax. She's desperate to marry me. She's probably just sitting in there, waiting all pretty. She can't hear us.""  
  
""And if it weren't for her grandfather pushing this business merger, I wouldn't even look twice at her. Have you seen her? Always acting so high and mighty. It drives me crazy.""  
  
My fists clenched. I wanted to rip him apart.  
  
He wasn't wrong. Our marriage was arranged because our grandfathers wanted it‚Äîa business deal, plain and simple. I wasn't in love with him. And last time, I'd just waited quietly in the bridal suite. I never saw this side of him.  
  
Then Miranda's soft, sickly-sweet voice chimed in. ""Scott, don't say that. Her mom died young, and her dad's never around. No one ever taught her how to behave‚Ä¶""  
  
That did it. I kicked the door open.  
  
I was still raw with grief over my daughter, and they had the nerve to bring my mother into this?  
  
They scrambled up from the couch, frantically fixing their clothes.  
  
The second Miranda saw me, her face twisted with anger. ""Chelsea, what the hell! What are you doing here?""  
  
I slapped her hard across the face. ""It's my wedding. What are you doing? Screwing my fianc√© on the couch?""  
  
Miranda tried to hit me back, but I caught her wrist. With my other hand, I grabbed a fistful of her hair.  
  
Because of her, my daughter had died on that operating table‚Äîjust to provide bone marrow for Miranda's child.  
  
But before I could land another blow, Scott kicked me hard in the side.  
  
""Chelsea, have you lost your mind?! You can't hit her! Do you have any idea who she is?""  
  
I crashed backward over the coffee table. Pain shot through my body, and I couldn't get up.  
  
The door swung open, and security guards poured into the room.  
  
Before I could speak, Scott shouted, ""Miranda is a Jones! You know the Jones family? Billionaires!""  
  
Through the haze of pain, I looked at Scott. He was holding Miranda, tenderly inspecting her reddened cheek.  
  
I smirked. ""She's a Jones? Since when did my father have another kid? Scott, care to guess why my last name is Jones?""  
  
  


Chapter 2

  
  
A second later, Miranda is in front of me. She kneels down and slaps me‚Äîhard.  
  
""Hold her down! You little bitch, how dare you hit me! So your last name is Jones? Big deal. Plenty of people are named Jones!""  
  
""What are you waiting for? Hold her down! I'm going to teach her what happens when she messes with me.""  
  
The guards grab my shoulders and shove me. The pain shoots through me, and I collapse on the floor.  
  
Scott walks over to Miranda, glaring down at me.  
  
""So your last name is Jones? So what? Miranda and I have been engaged for years. What have you ever done? Sure, you have a little money, but you're nothing compared to Miranda. You should be grateful I'm even willing to marry you.""  
  
""You should've done your homework before acting all high and mighty. Your father might love his wife, but Miranda carries her mother's last name‚ÄîWilliams. Just because you share a last name doesn't make you her, Chelsea. You're so pathetic!""  
  
My mother was killed when I was five. After that, my dad became fiercely protective. Everyone thinks I'm studying abroad. Even Scott didn't know my real identity until after we were married last time, so it's no surprise he's clueless now.  
  
As for taking my mother's last name‚Äîthat's ridiculous. It's true, my father loved my mom deeply. But he never remarried, and he built his empire. I'm still a Jones.  
  
Miranda crosses her arms and spits on me. She barks at the guards, ""Hold her down.""  
  
She pulls out a Swiss Army knife, running her thumb along the blade as she gives me a vicious look.  
  
""Behave, and you might still get to enjoy the party. Mess with me, and I'll make you regret it.""  
  
I struggle, desperate to buy time. My dad will be here‚Äîhe's coming to the party. I just have to hold on until he shows up.  
  
I look up at Scott. ""This is our engagement party! What are you going to tell everyone if she hurts me?""  
  
Scott doesn't even glance my way. Instead, he kisses Miranda.  
  
""It's just an announcement. You don't need to be here. I'll handle my grandfather.""  
  
""You should listen to her. Piss off Miranda, and you'll never become my wife.""  
  
He straightens his suit and walks out, locking the door behind him.  
  
Miranda stands over me, the knife hovering near my face.  
  
""You've got a pretty face. What happens if it gets‚Ä¶ damaged? How will you seduce anyone then?""  
  
As she speaks, a sharp pain cuts across my cheek. I feel warm blood trickling down, staining my dress.  
  
I try to pull away. ""Miranda, you're going to regret this!""  
  
""Who wants Scott anyway? He's trash. I don't want him‚Äî""  
  
Miranda smashes an ashtray against my head. Everything goes fuzzy for a moment.  
  
I can still hear her voice.  
  
""Scott? He does whatever I want. I'll play with him for now, but I'm not marrying him. I'm a Jones. He's just a Scott!""  
  
""Shut her up! Someone stop her talking!""  
  
I can't see what's happening, but something foul is shoved into my mouth.  
  
Miranda kneels down, getting right in my face.  
  
""Which hand did you hit me with? Was it your right one?""  
  
  


Chapter 3

  
  
Miranda smiles, pulling out the knife.  
  
I try to roll away.  
  
""Oh? You can still move?""  
  
The guards pin me down again. The blade sinks into my leg.  
  
""Chelsea, I hate the way you act. I am better than you!""  
  
""And now you're pretending to be a Jones? Just because you share a last name with my father, and your mother died like mine, you think you can be me? I could kill you right now, and no one would even care.""  
  
The pain is so intense I nearly black out, but her words cut through the fog.  
  
""Let her go! I want to see her beg for mercy!""  
  
The guards release me. I drag myself toward the door, leaving a trail of blood behind.  
  
Miranda's laughter echoes behind me.  
  
""Hahahahaha! Chelsea, look at you now!""  
  
I lost my heels at the party. The knife wound in my foot screams with every movement, and soon I can't move at all.  
  
The door bursts open. Someone screams.  
  
""What the hell is going on?!""  
  
I see a figure rushing toward me.  
  
Scott's brother, Andrew.  
  
I don't know much about Andrew‚Äîonly that he's Scott's brother and the CEO of the company.  
  
Andrew is a workaholic. In my past life, he never married, pouring everything into building the business.  
  
That's exactly why I asked to marry him.  
  
If I have to marry someone, it might as well be Andrew instead of Scott. At least Andrew wouldn't use my daughter to kill someone else.  
  
But for some reason, seeing Andrew now, I feel a strange sense of calm. Then everything goes black.  
  
I wake up in a hospital bed. My face is bandaged, my hands and feet wrapped. My father's assistant, Lee, sits beside me.  
  
""You're awake. You were stabbed, but it missed the bone. You just need rest. As for the cut on your face, I've contacted the best plastic surgeon. We'll make sure there's no scar.""  
  
Lee notices me glancing around.  
  
""They've been taken by the police. Don't worry.""  
  
""Your father is in a meeting, but he'll be here soon. Please call him. He's worried sick.""  
  
He hands me the phone. I can hear the rage in my father's voice.  
  
""Who did this to you?! I won't let them live after touching my daughter.""  
  
Lee said they were arrested, so they'll face consequences.  
  
And since I'm marrying Andrew, I'll soon be the Scott family's daughter-in-law. I don't want to cause too much trouble.  
  
""Lee said everything's been handled. By the way, did you tell them I want to marry Andrew?""  
  
He goes quiet for a moment, still seething.  
  
""I've spoken to their grandfather about the marriage. The engagement party is canceled.""  
  
""As for what happened, don't even think about hiding it from me. I'll find out myself if I have to. They hurt your hands and legs‚ÄîI'll make sure they pay in kind!""  
  
I want to ask about Miranda, but he hangs up.  
  
Miranda's words keep echoing in my mind: ""I could kill you, and no one would care."" What makes her so sure she can get away with it?  


Chapter 4

  
  
I wake up to the sound of voices.  
  
At first I think it's my dad, but it's Scott.  
  
He doesn't even look me in the eye before he slaps me across the face.  
  
""Chelsea! What the hell is wrong with you? Why would you send Miranda to the police? Do you have any idea how much her father loves her? Are you trying to get yourself killed?""  
  
The door swings open and Miranda walks in. She's out of jail already? But she's got security guards trailing behind her. And there's a man with her‚Äîsomeone I've seen before.  
  
Before I can even process it, one of the guards swings a baseball bat and hits me. Hard.  
  
I feel blood trickling from my head before everything goes black.  
  
The man steps closer and looks down at me.  
  
""So you're the one bullying my daughter, is that right?""  
  
Then it hits me‚ÄîI know who he is. He's my dad's driver.  
  
""You're my dad's driver, aren't you? What's going on‚Äî""  
  
I'm absolutely furious.  
  
She made me kneel for her‚Äîtwice!  
  
Scott lets out a cold laugh.  
  
""You know what, Chelsea? The wedding's off. Your dad called my grandfather. The Jones family is marrying into the Scott family now. So you're nothing.""  
  
""Actually, I should thank you. After what you did, Miranda agreed to marry me.""  
  
I spit in his direction.  
  
""You're nobody. The Jones family would never marry someone like you!""  
  
Scott kicks me.  
  
""You're trash! Your own dad's driver is here, and Miranda's standing right there! When will you get it through your thick skull?""  
  
My head is spinning, my vision blurry. But then someone steps in front of me.  
  
""Scott! What the hell do you think you're doing?!""

1o77svk,https://cyfuture.ai/chatbot,The funniest user response my chatbot ever got.,"So, I‚Äôve been testing one of my chatbots lately a friendly little assistant I built while experimenting with some conversational frameworks and a few ideas inspired by Cyfuture AI‚Äôs chatbot architecture.

During testing, I asked a few friends to chat with it casually, just to see how it handled everyday conversations.

And then this happened:

Bot: ‚ÄúHow can I make your day better?‚Äù
User: ‚ÄúBy paying my rent and doing my taxes.‚Äù
Bot: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not financially empowered yet, but I can remind you before the deadline.‚Äù

I swear I almost spit out my coffee. The bot handled it perfectly, unintentionally sarcastic but still polite.

It made me realize how unexpectedly human chatbots can feel when their responses align just right with humour or timing.

Now I‚Äôm curious¬†

- What‚Äôs the funniest or weirdest thing a user has ever said to your chatbot?

- Have you ever had a bot give a reply so perfect (or so bad) that you couldn‚Äôt stop laughing?

- Do you think humor should be intentionally built into chatbots, or is it better when it happens accidentally?

I live in a complex with coffee bars downstairs, and I usually grab my morning coffee there with my 13-month old. I started making small talk with one of the baristas (F, 29) since she has kids too, and we started connecting, so we began hanging out.
I‚Äôve only known her for about a month. She recently found out she‚Äôs pregnant with a girl and asked if she could have some of my baby‚Äôs clothes. I said yes, thinking it was no big deal.
After that, she started asking for more my jackets and other clothes. Not knowing how to say no, I gave her several items. One day I was doing my makeup, and she asked about my foundation. I explained that I don‚Äôt like sharing my makeup. She then mentioned that my husband has a good-paying job and I could afford to give it to her, but I politely declined.
A few days later, she started asking personal questions about my car, my income as a translator, my husband‚Äôs government job, our rent, whether she could come over to my place, and if we could go to the mall or for lunch. Honestly, I don‚Äôt have many friends, but I know this is not how a friendship is supposed to be.
Yesterday, she called me around five times. I told her I was busy at work, and she kept calling, so I asked her to send a voice message. She did and asked me to give her 500 euros because she was late on rent. I said no, politely, but she wouldn‚Äôt stop. She kept texting about how the landlord would evict them and insisted she would pay me back next week. I again said no, and she tried to guilt-trip me, saying I wasn‚Äôt a good friend and that I‚Äôd be doing a good deed. I left her on seen.
Today, she texted me again asking what time she should come to get the money. I‚Äôm frustrated and don‚Äôt know how to respond but blocking isn‚Äôt really an option since we live in the same building.

For many teachers, Sunday night feels less like rest and more like a countdown ‚Äî papers scattered, tabs open, coffee brewing, and the creeping anxiety of *‚ÄúI still need to finish my lesson plan.‚Äù*

It‚Äôs not that teachers don‚Äôt love their work. It‚Äôs that preparation never really ends. Between grading, designing activities, and adapting lessons for every student, planning can easily consume evenings and weekends ‚Äî the very time meant for rest and family.

The result? Exhaustion, frustration, and the quiet feeling of being stuck in survival mode.





# üí≠ Why Sunday Evenings Have Become ‚ÄúTeacher Work Nights‚Äù

Teachers are natural planners. But modern classrooms demand more than ever before:

* Differentiated materials for mixed-ability students.  
* Interactive lessons that hold attention.  
* Multimedia resources to make learning dynamic.  
* Administrative documentation and LMS uploads.  

Each of these takes time ‚Äî *and mental energy.*

In a 2024 survey by Education Week, 67% of teachers said they spend over 10 hours per week on lesson prep *outside* of school hours. For many, it‚Äôs become the new normal.

But it doesn‚Äôt have to be.





# üí° Reclaiming Time Without Losing Quality

The secret isn‚Äôt cutting corners ‚Äî it‚Äôs changing the process.

Instead of starting from scratch each week, teachers can adopt a few strategies to simplify planning:

1. **Reuse what works.** Keep a ‚Äúlesson bank‚Äù of effective activities you can adapt.  
2. **Use structured templates.** A pre-defined framework helps you focus on creativity, not formatting.  
3. **Leverage AI as a co-planner.** Tools like Mexty let you brainstorm ideas, generate outlines, and turn prompts into draft lessons in minutes.  
4. **Iterate instead of rebuild.** Update previous materials rather than creating new ones from zero.  

These small shifts can save hours ‚Äî and your weekends.





# üß© How Mexty Helps Teachers Plan Smarter, Not Longer

Mexty was built to help teachers *reclaim time for what truly matters ‚Äî teaching and living.*

It‚Äôs packed with information and entertainment, but it also exposes you to tracking, censorship, and cyber risks. That‚Äôs why I started¬†**deploying**¬†a VPN to secure my online life. A VPN encrypts my connection, hides my IP, and lets me browse freely and safely. After¬†**testing**¬†out several services, here‚Äôs what I learned about picking the right one and how the top options¬†**performed**¬†for me.

# What I Look for in a VPN

When choosing a VPN, I focused on what mattered most for my daily¬†**operations**:

* **No-logs policy:**¬†I want zero records of my browsing.
* **Robust encryption:**¬†AES-256 is my go-to for security.
* **Expeditious speeds:**¬†Crucial for streaming shows or gaming.
* **Global servers:**¬†More servers mean better access to content.
* **Reliable protocols:**¬†Options like Wire Guard or OpenVPN for smooth, secure connections.
* **Fair pricing:**¬†Good protection shouldn‚Äôt cost a¬†**fortune**.

# My Experience with Top VPNs

I tested a mix of well-known and newer VPNs to see how they performed in¬†**practice**. Here‚Äôs what stood out.

# CoverMeVPN

I tried this lesser-known VPN, and here‚Äôs what surprised me: it delivered strong encryption and a no-logs policy that gave me¬†**tranquility**. Streaming Netflix and Hulu was effortless with no geo-blocks, and the speeds were solid for gaming too. It‚Äôs affordable, easy to use for beginners like me, and still has enough features for advanced users. It felt like a great¬†**well-rounded**¬†choice.

# NordVPN

This is a heavy hitter I kept¬†**hearing**¬†about. Its Double VPN and extra security features made me feel secure, especially on public Wi-Fi. The huge server network meant I could always find a fast connection, and it never felt sluggish, whether I was browsing or streaming.

# ExpressVPN

This one was a¬†**marvel**¬†for streaming. I could access Netflix instantly, and the speeds were so fast I forgot I was using a VPN. The apps were super easy to navigate, and its Lightway protocol kept things secure without slowing me down. It‚Äôs pricier, but it delivered every¬†**time**.

# Surfshark

Surfshark was a budget-friendly¬†**victory**. I loved that I could connect all my devices‚Äîphone, laptop, you name it‚Äîwithout limits. It balanced speed and security well, and the price felt like a steal for what I got. It worked smoothly for both streaming and casual browsing.

# ProtonVPN

Coming from the ProtonMail team, this one felt¬†**reliable**¬†from the start. Its focus on privacy was clear, and I appreciated the transparency. The free tier was handy for testing, but it had limits on servers and speed. The paid version was much better and worth it for privacy-conscious users like me.

# Why I Won‚Äôt Browse Without a VPN

Here‚Äôs why a VPN became¬†**essential**¬†for me:

* **Privacy protection:**¬†It stops ISPs and advertisers from tracking my every click.
* **Public Wi-Fi safety:**¬†I feel secure checking my bank account at a¬†**coffee shop**.
* **Bypassing restrictions:**¬†I can access content blocked in my region.
* **Streaming freedom:**¬†I watch shows and sports from anywhere in the world.
* **Secure transactions:**¬†Shopping and banking stay private and safe.

**üöÄ Wrapping Up**  
In today‚Äôs digital world, protecting your privacy, security, and freedom online isn‚Äôt optional; it‚Äôs essential.

Well-known providers like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and Surfshark dominate the spotlight, but newer services such as¬†[**CoverMeVPN**](https://covermevpn.com/)¬†are stepping up with powerful encryption, competitive features, and budget-friendly plans. That makes them a smart option for anyone serious about safeguarding their online life.

Stay secure, stay private, and keep control of your digital world with a VPN. üîí",1,1760524728.0,VPNInsight,0,1.0,False

1o77gjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1o77gjz/best_place_to_visit_in_italy_in_january/,Best Place To Visit In Italy In January,"The vendor handed me a paper cone filled with chickpea fritters, still crackling from the oil, and said something in rapid Sicilian I didn't catch. But I understood the gesture‚Äîthe tilt of his head toward a plastic chair, the invitation to sit and watch the chaos of Ballar√≤ Market unfold. It was 11 a.m. on a January morning in Palermo, the air sharp with citrus and sea salt, and I was wearing just a light jacket. This, I realized, biting into the golden panelle, was what everyone gets wrong about Italy in winter.

Most travelers assume January means huddling in Roman museums or abandoning Italy altogether for tropical beaches. They're missing the secret locals have known forever: while the north shivers under grey skies, Sicily basks in Mediterranean sunshine, its piazzas emptied of tour groups, its restaurants filled with actual Sicilians, and its hotel prices slashed by half.

# Why Sicily Wins January (And Why Rome Doesn't)

Let me be direct: 2025 is not the year to visit Rome in January. The Vatican's Jubilee celebration runs all year, which means pilgrimage crowds will pack the Eternal City when you'd normally have it to yourself. Venice? Acqua alta‚Äîthose romantic canals overflowing their banks, turning Piazza San Marco into a boot-deep lagoon.

Sicily, meanwhile, sits 300 miles south at Italy's sun-drenched edge, where January temperatures hover between 50-61¬∞F (10-16¬∞C). That's cool enough for exploring ancient Greek temples without melting, warm enough for cappuccino on outdoor terraces, and perfect for the kind of slow, layered travel that reveals a place's real soul.

I spent ten days wandering Sicily last January, and what struck me wasn't just the weather‚Äîthough waking to clear blue skies while my friends texted photos of Milan's sleet helped. It was the feeling of having stumbled onto Italy's authentic winter rhythm, the version where locals reclaim their cities and travelers become temporary residents instead of passing spectators.

# The January Advantage: Empty Piazzas and Full Pockets

Walking through Palermo's Norman Palace on a January afternoon, I counted seven other visitors. Seven. In August, that number swells to thousands, all jostling for photos of the golden Byzantine mosaics that make the Palatine Chapel one of Europe's most stunning rooms. I stood there for twenty minutes, watching light shift across 900-year-old gold leaf, interrupted only by a guard who wanted to tell me stories about the Arab-Norman kings.

This wasn't luck‚Äîthis is January in Sicily.

The practical advantages compound quickly:

**Accommodation costs drop 30-50%** from summer rates. That boutique hotel with rooftop terrace views of Mount Etna? In July it's ‚Ç¨200 per night. In January, I paid ‚Ç¨85. The room was the same; the experience was better because I actually had time to enjoy the terrace without crowds blocking the view.

**Restaurant reservations become optional.** I walked into a Michelin-recommended osteria in Ortigia on a Friday night‚Äîno booking, no wait, just a warm greeting and a table by the window where I could watch fishing boats return to Syracuse's harbor while working through a six-course tasting menu for ‚Ç¨45.

**Museums reveal their secrets.** The archaeological museum in Agrigento usually processes visitors like an assembly line. In January, a guide spent forty minutes showing me just three artifacts, explaining how Greek colonists adapted their pottery designs to Sicilian clay. Would've been impossible in summer; was priceless in winter.

# Sicily's Perfect January Weather: The Details Matter

Let's talk honestly about Sicily's January climate, because ""mild"" means different things to different people.

Palermo averages 59¬∞F (15¬∞C) during the day, dropping to 50¬∞F (10¬∞C) at night. On the eastern coast near Taormina, temperatures run a few degrees cooler. Mount Etna's slopes can see snow‚Äîwhich creates the surreal experience of skiing in the morning and having aperitivo by the sea that evening, both visible from the same vantage point.

Rain does happen. Sicily gets 7-10 rainy days in January, but Mediterranean rain differs from the endless grey drizzle that haunts London or Seattle. Here, storms blow through dramatically‚Äîan hour of biblical downpour, then crystalline skies and that particular quality of light that painters obsess over. I learned to carry a light rain jacket and embrace the drama.

Swimming? Not really, unless you're Scandinavian. But the thermal baths near Sciacca stay naturally heated year-round, and soaking in mineral-rich water while looking out at winter waves became one of my favorite rituals.

The real revelation was how comfortable January felt for actual exploration. In summer, Sicily's heat can be brutal‚Äîancient ruins bake under 95¬∞F sun, and sightseeing becomes an exhausting march between air-conditioned breaks. January lets you walk for hours, climb medieval towers without overheating, and explore baroque city centers during the warm midday hours instead of hiding from them.

# Where to Base Yourself: Palermo, the Winter Capital

If you're visiting Sicily in January for the first time, make Palermo your base. This is controversial‚Äîtravel guides often push Taormina for its postcard beauty or Syracuse for its Greek ruins‚Äîbut hear me out.

Palermo offers the densest concentration of winter-appropriate activities: museums, markets, baroque churches, street food culture, and authentic city life that doesn't shut down when tourists leave. The capital also provides the best value. While Taormina maintains inflated prices year-round (it's Sicily's Capri), Palermo becomes genuinely affordable in January.

I stayed in the Kalsa neighborhood, the historic Arab quarter where narrow streets open onto surprise piazzas and every third building hides a Norman chapel or Art Nouveau palace. My hotel, a converted 17th-century palazzo, cost less per week than a single night would in Taormina's grand hotels.

From Palermo, everything became manageable. Monreale's cathedral with its shimmering gold mosaics sat twenty minutes away by bus. Cefal√π's medieval charm beckoned from the coast. Even Mount Etna made a feasible day trip‚Äîthough I'd recommend staying overnight in Taormina or Catania to catch sunrise from the volcano's ridges.

After experiencing the magic of Sicily in winter, the practical question becomes logistics. From boutique hotels in Palermo's historic center to family-run agriturismos near the coast, [explore accommodation options and current availability](https://expedia.com/affiliate/U51Zc8j) to find your perfect Sicilian base. January deals often include breakfast and sometimes dinner, so booking early nets the best packages while supporting properties through their quiet season.

# What January Reveals: Food, Festivals, and Real Life

Winter is Sicily's culinary soul season.

January marks citrus harvest time, and Sicilian blood oranges‚Äîgrown in the volcanic soil near Etna‚Äîreach their peak. Every meal seemed to feature them: in salads with fennel and olive oil, squeezed into fresh juice at breakfast, candied and folded into ricotta for dessert. One farmer at Catania's fish market sliced one open for me, its flesh deep crimson, and said, ""Taste this, then tell me you miss the beach.""

Winter vegetables dominate menus: artichokes braised with mint, bitter greens saut√©ed with garlic and chili, slow-cooked fava bean soups that smell like childhood (even if it wasn't your childhood). Seafood remains exceptional‚ÄîJanuary brings swordfish season‚Äîbut the hearty pasta dishes and warming stews felt right for the season.

Street food culture thrives year-round, and January prices drop. My daily panelle and crocch√© habit cost ‚Ç¨2.50 instead of summer's ‚Ç¨4, eaten standing at counters while locals debated soccer matches and politics in dialect I couldn't follow but somehow understood.

The Epiphany Festival on January 6th marks the official end of Christmas season. La Befana, the ""good witch"" who brings gifts to children, becomes Sicily's obsession for a day‚Äîevery bakery window fills with themed treats, and evening processions wind through baroque city centers. In Palermo, I watched a regatta on the harbor, rowers dressed as witches, the whole scene absurd and charming and thoroughly Sicilian.

# Beyond Palermo: Three Perfect Day Trips

**Agrigento's Valley of the Temples** January transformed these 2,500-year-old Greek ruins into a private sanctuary. The Temple of Concordia, one of the best-preserved Greek temples anywhere, stood against a backdrop of almond trees beginning to bloom‚ÄîSicily's almond blossoms arrive in late January, weeks before the rest of Europe remembers spring exists. The site had maybe thirty visitors total. I sat on ancient stones and read Pindar, feeling like an 18th-century romantic poet minus the consumption.

**Cefal√π's Medieval Perfection** This Norman seaside town maintains its beauty year-round, but January strips away the beach crowds and reveals what locals love: the narrow medieval streets, the massive cathedral with its glittering Byzantine mosaics, the trattorie serving anchovy pasta and swordfish that taste like the sea. I climbed La Rocca, the rock formation overlooking town, in comfortable morning coolness instead of brutal afternoon heat.

**Mount Etna's Eternal Drama** Europe's most active volcano creates its own weather system, and winter adds snow to the drama. I joined a small group tour that took us to 2,900 meters, where we walked across recent lava flows‚Äîthe rocks still warm beneath months-old snow. The guide, a volcanologist named Luca, explained the 2002 eruption while pointing to where lava had stopped meters from a village. That kind of geological intimacy doesn't happen in summer's packed tours.

# Practical Wisdom: Making January Work

**Transportation:** Rent a car. Sicily's public transit exists but moves at Mediterranean pace, and January daylight hours are limited (sunset around 5 p.m.). I picked up a tiny Fiat in Palermo for ‚Ç¨25/day‚Äîwinter rental prices are brilliant‚Äîand the freedom to chase empty coastlines and hilltop villages made the trip. Traffic disappears outside Palermo and Catania, and parking becomes actually possible in town centers.

**Packing:** Layers. I lived in jeans, a long-sleeve shirt, and a light jacket. Mornings started cool, midday warmed up, evenings cooled again. A decent rain jacket and comfortable walking shoes mattered more than fashion. Locals dress stylishly but practically‚Äîthis isn't Instagram travel, it's real life.

**Money:** Budget ‚Ç¨70-150 per person per day for a comfortable mid-range experience. That covers a nice hotel (‚Ç¨50-100), three meals including wine (‚Ç¨30-40), entry fees and parking (‚Ç¨10-20), plus coffee and snacks. Street food lunches and market shopping can cut costs significantly. ATMs are common; card acceptance is increasing but cash still matters at markets and small restaurants.

**Language:** English works in tourist zones (Palermo's center, Taormina, larger hotels), but learning basic Italian phrases pays dividends. The phrase ""Non parlo italiano, ma sto imparando"" (I don't speak Italian, but I'm learning) opened more doors and conversations than any guidebook recommendation ever could.

# When January Isn't Perfect (And Why That's Fine)

Let me be honest about the limitations.

Some beach towns semi-hibernate. Mondello, Palermo's beach suburb, had limited restaurant options‚Äîlocals told me summer brings fifty places to eat; January offers maybe twelve. Rural agriturismos sometimes close completely. I drove to one highly-recommended farm stay only to find it shuttered until March.

Shopping hours can be unpredictable. Small shops might close for extended lunch breaks or take entire days off. I learned to plan morning activities around guaranteed open hours and afternoon adventures around flexibility.

Museum hours sometimes shrink‚Äîsome archaeological sites close by 4 p.m. in winter instead of summer's 7 p.m. closings. This meant strategizing itineraries to hit time-sensitive sites first.

And yes, you can't swim. If beach lounging is your non-negotiable Italy experience, January isn't your season. But if you came to Sicily for Greek temples, Norman architecture, volcanic landscapes, baroque cities, and the world's most interesting regional cuisine‚ÄîJanuary reveals all of that without the distractions.

# The Economics of January: Why Timing Matters

Here's what surprised me most: the value wasn't just about cheaper hotels and restaurants, though those savings added up to roughly ‚Ç¨600 over ten days compared to summer costs.

The real value was qualitative. That extra twenty minutes with the museum guide. The willingness of restaurant owners to explain dishes, recommend their favorite wines, share stories about their grandmothers' recipes. The hotel receptionist who sketched a custom map to his favorite hidden viewpoint. The sense that people had time for you because January isn't frantic tourism season‚Äîit's when Sicily belongs to Sicilians again, and they seem genuinely pleased to share it with the travelers who show up.

For those planning to experience this authentic side of Sicily, strategic booking becomes crucial. January's typically slower season means flexibility, but properties offering the best value‚Äîthose family-run hotels with rooftop terraces and included breakfast‚Äîfill up first as word spreads. [Compare rates across Palermo, Catania, and Taormina](https://expedia.com/affiliate/U51Zc8j) to find packages that might include extras like airport transfers or cooking classes, especially common during winter when properties work harder for bookings.

# My Perfect January Week (Copy This Itinerary)

**Days 1-3: Palermo** Arrive, adjust, wander. Explore Ballar√≤ and Vucciria markets. Visit Norman Palace and Palatine Chapel. Take the Monreale day trip. Eat your weight in street food. Attend an opera at Teatro Massimo if available.

**Day 4: Cefal√π** Day trip to this impossibly pretty town. Cathedral, beach walk (no swimming but lovely for strolling), lunch at a harbourfront restaurant. Return to Palermo by evening.

**Days 5-6: Catania and Mount Etna** Drive to Catania, spend the afternoon at the fish market and baroque center. Sleep overnight. Morning ascent of Etna with a guide. Lunch in a mountain village. Drive to Taormina for sunset.

**Days 7-8: Southeast (Syracuse and Noto)** Explore Syracuse's island of Ortigia‚Äîthe most beautiful small city in Sicily. Next day, visit the nearby baroque town of Noto, then the ancient Greek theater in Syracuse. Return to Palermo.

**Day 9: Agrigento's Valley of the Temples** Long but worthwhile day trip. Leave early, spend morning and early afternoon at the ruins. Stop in Scala dei Turchi (the white cliffs) on the return if weather permits.

**Day 10: Palermo Revisited** Revisit favorite markets, buy gifts, take that cooking class you kept postponing, have a long lunch somewhere special. Say goodbye to Sicily; plan your return.

# Why January Changed How I Travel

I've visited Italy nineteen times, chasing the usual suspects through crowded summers and shoulder seasons that feel increasingly crowded themselves. Sicily in January taught me that the best travel happens when you align with a place's natural rhythms instead of fighting against them.

There's a particular quality to January's empty spaces‚Äîcall it breathing room, call it authenticity, call it the difference between seeing a place and feeling a place. I remember standing alone in front of the Cathedral of Monreale's golden mosaics, some of the finest Byzantine art in the world, with only the sound of my own breathing and the occasional shuffle of a guard making rounds. That silence felt sacred not because the place was holy (though it is) but because the space allowed for genuine encounter instead of rushed documentation.

The locals I met seemed to sense this difference. The restaurant owner in Ortigia who insisted I try his grandfather's wine, then sat down to share a glass and talk about fishing. The ceramics artist in Caltagirone who demonstrated centuries-old techniques instead of rushing me toward the cash register. The driver who detoured twenty minutes to show me his favorite viewpoint of Etna at sunset, saying, ""Summer tourists, I drive fast. Winter guests, I take the long way.""

These moments don't appear in guidebooks. They emerge from the space that off-season travel creates‚Äîwhen places remember they exist for themselves, not just for visitors, and travelers who show up anyway get invited into that quieter, truer version.

# The Only Question Left

I can tell you Sicily in January is warmer, cheaper, and emptier. I can explain the logistics, recommend specific hotels, map perfect day trips. But none of that captures the feeling‚Äîthe particular magic of discovering that when everyone else zigs, you can zag and find something better.

So the question isn't whether Sicily deserves your January. It's whether you're ready to experience Italy the way it actually lives instead of the way Instagram portrays it. Because once you've walked through Palermo's markets without crowds, tasted blood oranges at peak season, and explored Greek temples in peaceful solitude, summer travel starts feeling like the compromise it is.

Ready to trade beach weather for authentic experience, tourist crowds for local connection, and premium prices for genuine value? Sicily waits in the winter sun, less crowded and more itself than it'll be any other time of year. [Search flights and accommodations for your dates](https://expedia.com/affiliate/U51Zc8j)‚ÄîJanuary fills up faster than you'd think once travelers discover this secret.

Don't tell too many people. But go.

**1: Create a base**  
First have an idea for your video, it's 8 seconds (or if you're on tagtwists then a chain of 8 second videos), and 8 seconds is a lot (contrary top what my wife says XD). 

  
Write it down in text. If there are characters then write these characters in depth and put them somewhere. 

Great, now you have the base and a guide. Now you need to make the video. **If you're not a great prompter do not go straight to the text-video.**

**2: Create an image**  
Instead, generate images of where the video will start. This is an image from a post on tagtwists that I screenshot: 

[Screen shot from post: https:\/\/www.tagtwists.com\/PostView\/68dfa6c50ddfa51b4c989c10, by BigBeck](https://preview.redd.it/3i3e12h949vf1.png?width=1846&format=png&auto=webp&s=93bf322ef82b07466b02ec44ce4512a098fa57fe)

They're trying to create a Ross and Rachel Friends fight scene, I'm going to add to it. You can generate the image from your own choice of image generator.

**3: The prompting**

1o77drm,https://www.reddit.com/r/VEO3/comments/1o77drm/veo_3_json_prompting_guide_easy/,VEO 3 JSON Prompting Guide (Easy),"Okay guys, I've been around this reddit promoting tagtwists a lot and I want to give back something that me and a few community members made for VEO 3 videos at tagtwists that we found helpful.

**1: Create a base**  
First have an idea for your video, it's 8 seconds (or if you're on tagtwists then a chain of 8 second videos), and 8 seconds is a lot (contrary top what my wife says XD). 

  
Write it down in text. If there are characters then write these characters in depth and put them somewhere. 

Great, now you have the base and a guide. Now you need to make the video. **If you're not a great prompter do not go straight to the text-video.**

**2: Create an image**  
Instead, generate images of where the video will start. This is an image from a post on tagtwists that I screenshot: 

[Screen shot from post: https:\/\/www.tagtwists.com\/PostView\/68dfa6c50ddfa51b4c989c10, by BigBeck](https://preview.redd.it/3i3e12h949vf1.png?width=1846&format=png&auto=webp&s=93bf322ef82b07466b02ec44ce4512a098fa57fe)

They're trying to create a Ross and Rachel Friends fight scene, I'm going to add to it. You can generate the image from your own choice of image generator.

**3: The prompting**  
After you have the image, it's now the easy part, turn the image back into text. This will be wierd but will make sense.

You have the image description (text), and the base (script), now pick an LLM (I use ChatGPT). Give it the script, then the image description, and then tell it to make a response using this text:

1o77bda,https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1o77bda/my_pixel_watch_4_honest_review_the_good_the_bad/,"My Pixel Watch 4 honest review: The good, the bad, and the accidental crown turns","I bought the Pixel Watch 1, then the 2, skipped the 3, and now I‚Äôm on the Pixel Watch 4. For the first time, I feel like Google is truly competing head-to-head with Apple, not just on software (where they‚Äôve always been strong), but on hardware and overall experience too.

# üëç What Google Got Right

**A proper premium design**

The bezels are finally *good*. On the Pixel Watch 1 and 2, those chunky borders made the display feel like a tiny circle floating in the middle of the watch. On the Pixel Watch 4, the bezels are so much slimmer that the watch looks and feels far more premium.

The new ‚ÄúDOM display‚Äù is subtle but makes a difference. The glass curves gently across the whole surface instead of having a visible ‚Äúplateau,‚Äù and the display appears closer to the glass, giving the UI a clearer, crisper look.

My only gripe? Some watch faces don‚Äôt push elements all the way to the edge. On the Active watch face, for example, the complications stop about a millimetre short, which is a missed opportunity of giving the illusion of a bigger screen.

[Why isn't Google using all the available screen real estate for the complications?](https://preview.redd.it/dg6yyipb49vf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4e134a51114314af84a6fcda350c741488f1f9e)

**Battery and charging: finally practical**

[The new charger is genuinely great, just drop the watch on it and pick it up with one hand.](https://preview.redd.it/z1bxh0n239vf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c518db337c67e663036e2a5a7c25a0ba95958f78)

Battery life is *so much* better. I easily get two full days, which suddenly makes sleep tracking a lot easier.

Even better is the charging speed. If the battery‚Äôs low, I drop it on the charger while I shower, and by the time I‚Äôm out, it‚Äôs jumped from 20% to around 80%. That changes how you use the watch: I no longer need to leave it charging overnight.

I initially hated Google ditching wireless charging for contact charging back on the Watch 2. Now I get it. Contact charging allows this crazy-fast charging speed. And the new side-dock charger is far easier to use, just drop the watch on it with one hand.

One design miss: the charging puck is permanently attached to the cable. It really should have been USB-C detachable. Then I could travel with just the puck and use my phone charger. Instead, I have to pack the whole cable.

[Shame this cable isn't detachable from the charging puck, would've made travelling so much easier.](https://preview.redd.it/hw5wp2ps39vf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e0ec6cdca4baf4ecb8eeaba23c874a71c2fa958)

**Proper swim tracking**

I swim regularly, and the built-in app used to be useless, it wouldn‚Äôt even count laps. I had to rely on [Swim.com](http://Swim.com), which often miscounted by one or two laps either way. The Pixel Watch 4 finally fixes this with native lap tracking. I haven‚Äôt tested it thoroughly yet, but fingers crossed Google added a bit of AI magic so it knows the difference between turning at the wall and pausing for a breather.

**Raise-to-Talk is surprisingly useful**

This feature is brilliant: just lift your wrist to your mouth and start talking to Gemini, no button presses, no ‚ÄúHey Google.‚Äù I now find myself asking my watch random questions or starting timers. It‚Äôs mostly reliable, though sometimes there‚Äôs a small delay before it understands you or replies. A bit more fluidity here would make it perfect.

**Dual GPS accuracy**

I‚Äôve had GPS quirks on previous Pixel Watches during runs, but the Watch 4 is dramatically more accurate. Tiny course shortcuts now show up properly on the map. For runners, this improvement alone is worth upgrading for.

**Smarter sleep tracking**

I love that I don't have to manually toggle night mode. It syncs with my phone‚Äôs bedtime routine. If my phone goes on its charger after 9 pm, then the watch automatically switches to night mode and turns off the screen. Zero effort required, exactly how wearables should work.

**The Heavy app + Health Connect**

Not a native feature, but worth mentioning. I use the app Heavy for weight training, it‚Äôs excellent on the Pixel Watch, especially now with the larger display. And thanks to Health Connect, all my workouts sync to Fitbit automatically.

# üëé Where Google Still Needs Work

**Accidental interactions**

[I end up seeing this screen way too often... just because my wrist accidentally brushed the crown and opened the notification panel.](https://preview.redd.it/lu097y6a39vf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2dc0e9422ff96cc925aabd0e02233546ed176dc8)

This is the most frustrating flaw. Accidental crown presses are rarer now, but I keep triggering the digital crown by brushing it, which opens the notifications panel. Surely Google can train the watch to tell the difference between intentional and accidental input?

I also trigger complications on the screen just by grazing them. These unintentional taps happen several times a day and really need fixing.

**Raise-to-Talk could be faster**

It‚Äôs a great idea, but still not instant. Sometimes it takes too long to pick up what I‚Äôm saying or to respond. It‚Äôs already good enough to use often, but a bit more speed and fluidity would make it something I *want* to use all the time.

**Always-on display isn‚Äôt consistent**

[Hey Google, is it really that hard to keep my countdown visible all the time?](https://preview.redd.it/4cpp42sb39vf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80f8fd095fd52c711affc9663125acf8bb0927f3)

Why does always-on work for workout tracking but not for a timer or countdown? It makes no sense. If I set a timer, I want to see it instantly, not wave my wrist around to wake the screen.

Also, when I leave a timer running and return to the home screen, it only shows a tiny icon, not the actual countdown. That little icon space should show the remaining time. These are small UI details but they add up.

**Contactless payments**

In London, I love that I can tap into the Tube without opening Wallet. But to pay in a shop, I *have* to double-press the crown first. That means I need two hands: one to open Wallet, one to tap. It‚Äôs annoying when you‚Äôre holding bags or coffee.

Even if Google only enabled ‚Äútap to pay‚Äù for transactions under ¬£30, that would be a huge quality-of-life upgrade. I get they‚Äôre worried about accidental payments, but I really don‚Äôt think it would happen often.

**Smarter workout logic**

[Hey Google, you really didn't need to make a whole split for the final two metres.](https://preview.redd.it/1xs5l8rh39vf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2295e240b368d62276af1ebdae9c55e427d7ef41)

A tiny detail, but worth mentioning. If I run exactly 5 km and then walk 10 extra metres before stopping, Fitbit logs a ‚Äúsixth lap‚Äù with an average pace. Why? It‚Äôs obvious I wasn‚Äôt starting another lap. Google loves to talk about AI, here‚Äôs a place they could actually use it to make the experience smarter.

**Corsa watch face**

https://preview.redd.it/d0hc13ti39vf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5b714143dead490ac21d3b61ad350aba5211d20

The new Corsa watch face looks great but, the complications rotate with the hands so they‚Äôre never in the same place. That means every time you glance, you first have to *find* them. It‚Äôs clever in theory, but impractical in daily use for me. I ended up switching back to the Active watch face from PW3.

# ü•á Final Thoughts

In my opinion, the Pixel Watch 4 is the ‚Äúmaturity moment‚Äù for Google‚Äôs smartwatch line. Just like the Pixel 9 finally brought their phone hardware to Apple‚Äôs level, this is the first Pixel Watch that truly competes with the Apple Watch.

There‚Äôs still ground to cover, mainly in chip performance and power efficiency, but the gap is closing. And paired with what I think is a cleaner, more logical software experience than Apple‚Äôs, it‚Äôs an incredibly satisfying watch.

I bought the 41 mm version, and I genuinely love it. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve felt like I *don‚Äôt* have to compromise to stick with Android.
