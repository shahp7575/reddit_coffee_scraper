1nrefht,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nrefht,AIO: I feel my boss is asking way too much from me at 8 weeks pregnant,"Hi this might be long winded but I need advice cuz I am freaking out. I am almost 8 months pregnant, and I have continued to do my part time cleaning job on top of working at a local coffee shop.
However, it is definitely getting more and more taxing on me, not to mention I am feeling very unprepared for when baby comes because I have barely any time at home. My cleaning boss has been asking me to add extra days, and they sometimes are including deep cleans or longer cleans. Although I have expressed it’s a lot for me, I also know she is overbooked and of course could use the extra cash, so I try to do as much as I can. 
This week I was working 6 days and really needed a day to myself (especially because she had me doing a deep clean on Monday) so I told her that I could do my Thursday clean next week.  I now have to travel 3 hours to get an ultrasound done on my day off, so originally I was going to ask her for an extra day off next week. When I told her my ultrasound was happening she said “you can still work 3 days though right?”
I looked at the schedule and should have said no but instead said yes, but that the house she wanted me to go to that has 5 cats is something I’m no longer comfortable with since I am not directly cleaning litter boxes but am still cleaning litter and leave there with litter all over my clothes. To add to this part of my frustration, when I originally expressed not wanting to clean this house due to the litter and being pregnant, she kinda gaslit me and said if i just wear a mask and gloves its fine so I’ve cleaned it a couple times now. 
Her response was “I’ll figure it out,” and then gave me a new clean (description of clean above) that seems like just WAY too much, especially with just me going to it. 
I’m not sure how to proceed as it seems anytime I express an issue it becomes a huge problem for her and now she’s already rearranged the schedule to make it “work for me.”  My boyfriend told me to just quit as I won’t be going back to cleaning after maternity leave is over anyway, but I do feel like I maybe have not set the best boundaries and it wouldn’t be fair to quit out of the blue. However I feel it should be fairly obvious that she’s asking a lot from me at this stage of pregnancy. Any advice is helpful!
Side note: I want to stop cleaning soon anyway and am not sure what her game plan is once I stop working to have the baby since she seems very dependent on me week to week. ",2,1758924429.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

We were exchanging texts and I admitted I was a bit embarrassed by the drunken encounter because it was so out of the norm for me. He replied saying there’s nothing to be embarrassed about…I’m super cool/great. I replied yeah but still slightly embarrassed and he never replied. 
I guess it was the hangixety after a lot of alcohol over a few days. He never replied… it’s been 2 weeks and it’s crossed my mind a lot.

Now I don’t know what comes next.","Just created this account after coming across Charlotte reels after years of hatred. It’s good to be back. Anyway, this is my first Reddit post, but listen to my story. This is a long but good one. It’s been haunting me for almost 2 years now, I tried to be coherent as possible, but let me know if something doesn't make sense, I tried adding all the important details.


I, F29, married my now husband, M30, after trying for over a year to convince my family that he’s the one I want to marry. My siblings and I were raised in America, but our parents come from a country close to Greece (trying to be as anonymous as possible). When we were young, my dad worked away from home, meaning my mom raised 4 kids alone. She did her best with what she had. As for my siblings, we were never close to another until the pandemic of 2020 forced us to lockdown, and that's when we got closer to each other.

I always believed that I would NEVER marry someone living in another country just because he’s the same ethnicity or culture as me. I wanted someone living in my city where we can go close to one another. I didn’t want to deal with traveling regularly to see my spouse, taking time off work, visa paperwork, teaching them Western culture and laws (and who knows how they'll act once they arrive in the USA).

As we got older, we all met our special ones. My brothers are now married with only their parents’ approval (my sister and I didn’t know or provide an opinion because it’s their life and choices). My family consists of 9 including me, with one older brother, 2 younger siblings, and my parents being the ones I technically need approval from if we're talking culturally. However, this was never a big deal for us since we were born and raised in NYS. After I met my now husband, I introduced him to my family because I didn’t want to “sneak” around to get to know him. (Other siblings not related to the story.)

My partner and I met at my job when he broke his device and I was his repair technician. We chatted and he told me he worked nearby in the cafe industry and I should come by for coffee. I took a chance and said yes and I don't regret it. Everything was great till my family got involved.

I told my family and they were EXCITED that I met someone and potentially get engaged. My mom was nagging me to go visit him at work regularly and she even talked to the women in his family to learn more about him, his family in the USA and outside, basically a background check to provide comfort. Everything was going great, mistake #1 happened, getting my dad involved. 

My dad, like any traditional dad, worked his whole life and left the children for my mom to raise. He never took part in decision-making when it came to life, schools, career, etc. We were raised to work and rely on ourselves. We didn’t know better so we just worked and were responsible for our own finances and we turned out VERY well.

The night my partner and his family came to visit us, my dad basically kicked them out due to multiple reasons:

Reason 1 is he was living in a country on a broken visa and was worried he was taking advantage of me, which is an understandable reason to have. Many cases occur where one person leaves as soon as they get their paperwork approved, leaving their family & kids behind. My partner tried not to talk much about it during the sit-down, but when my dad felt like he couldn’t be trusted due to his avoidance, that's when my dad shut it all down. My partner didn’t want to be judged by how life brought him to the USA. He wanted to be judged off his personality, what he can provide, what he has to offer.

Reason 2 is his employment was also not high class to marry me (I work at a big tech company with $1,400 biweekly (I work PT) and he gets a weekly wage of $1,100 (FT) in the cafe industry). While he does make almost $4,500 a month, it meant nothing because of his work industry. 

Reason 3 is his family isn't from a city; he's from a small village. 
The whole sit-down lasted only 45 minutes, from when they walked in to when the door was shut. 



I was furious. How can he kick out the man and his family that I chose and was brave enough to bring into my childhood home? He couldn't wait till they left till he gave me the ""no"" answer? How can people judge others on things they can't control like where they're born or how they live? The only reason worth judging is his visa situation.
Side note: My parents weren't born in America. They got their citizenship papers done like most Americans do. It’s not like they’re Native Americans or lived here generationally. 

I called my partner the same night and apologized. As he was saying his farewell speech to end things with me, I told him to ""give me a chance. I’m not my family“. Since then, we've been inseparable. The next day, I called off work and spent the day in random parks alone because I couldn't be home. I even took on a second job to avoid my family. I would go home at 11 p.m. and work at 10 a.m. I basically go home to shower and sleep.

My mom was the most upset. She was upset he wasn't honest in the beginning (he was afraid of my dad to judge him based on his visa status, and he was right). 
My mom had MULTIPLE chances to ask his family and get answers. I also have a feeling that she knew based on context clues but never straight up asked. My mom and I knew he was new to the country, and  she didn’t care he wasn't a citizen till my dad and brother got her paranoid.

Because my parents knew I wouldn’t let go of something or someone by force, they gave him high demands, such as must buy property near where they live (a pesky condo can cost $400,000) and double cash gift to bride (me) even though my brothers offered their wives half. (As if I’m worth more than my brothers’ wives???) Side note, one brother was able to mortgage a property due to me lending him about 50,000 USD, decreasing his mortgage (this was years before this story and if I know this is how they were, I wouldn't have given him a single dime) and my other brother is able to buy property but would have to leave the city and live far driving distance.

I’m reminding ya’ll that we are in our early 30s and we did not want to start our journey in debt to the bank, mortgage, etc. for living area. We wanted somewhere close to the city for work and date nights and hangouts. And not the suburbs where public transportation is a pain.

Mistake number two is when he tried to talk to my siblings about it, they kept saying he wasn't ready for marriage because he doesn’t have a business or a property. My family and I also can’t handle anger well and they started yelling on the phone and even tried to make a 3-way call against my partner to “team up” on him so I told him to hang up. That was the last time he talked to my siblings. For my parents, my dad was basically making my mom the bad guy by saying he’s taking advantage even though my dad has been living 3 hours away for the past 5 years, only coming to visit once every 3 months. It got to the point where my family tried to get his MEDICAL RECORDS to try to get any dirt on him (they couldn’t). My dad also sent a 40-year-old doctor to my job to watch me from far away if I’m good enough to marry him (he said no because I’m too young for him).

My mom was torn in this whole thing. She wanted me to be the old me, but I can never pretend like nothing happened. I would cry at nights, sit in parks all alone till 1 a.m. I just hated my new living situation.

When we realized nothing was going to work, we decided to move on with our journey. I told him my bridal demands were the same as my brother’s wife’s, so we're all equal, and I’m okay with renting until we have a big down payment for a property for eventually when we have kids and need to move. I've never been big into money since I worked at a young age and got myself through 2 colleges with 0 loans. I just wanted to secure myself in case my family was 1% right and he did take advantage of my citizenship. I also didn’t want to feel lesser than my siblings’ wives. I also deserve to feel like a bride.

After he approved my demands, we started looking for apartments halfway from his family and my family, but no luck (it’s VERY HARD to get an apartment approved). We looked for 4 months, and my partner started to get frustrated. I didn’t want to get married until we had a place, but with the hunting taking 4 months, he suggested we get legally married to at least start his paperwork. At first, I was hesitant because I didn’t want to get married and end our days. We go sleep in separate houses. I want to be with my husband in our home, but we didn’t know when home will happen.

After lots of thinking, we legally got married and, SAME, we went to start his residency and medical paperwork (what a ceremony), and we did spend a couple of nights in a hotel. One week after marriage, he found a lovely apartment with a garden and got approved! By the time the renovations and cleaning were done, I was able to move in, and we did a religious marriage ceremony. We literally started with 0 furniture (we slept on blankets on the floor) to now we have a beautiful new apartment with all new furniture that we both love. His work permit was approved in less than a month, and we received his approval for residency in 6 months (when most cases can take up to 3-5 years for approval or denial). My brothers have been married longer than me, and their wives’ cases are still in step 3 out of 6, meaning they still have a long way to go. Throughout the year, I tried to tell my family little updates about him, saying how he got a better-paying job, he got his permanent residency, nothing was budging. I then sent out a text in the group chat saying I’m choosing myself because nothing is working, and they said ""whatever makes you happy"" (yeah, sure. Where was that energy before?)

Now our journey wasn't easy. I lied to my family for over a YEAR that I got a job offer and was leaving their home for a new work opportunity but also because I couldn't live in toxicity anymore. I don't regret my double life choices, but I wish they had made it easier and not been biased. They were hypocrites and discriminating against someone of their own race and culture. They viewed him as garbage and lesser than me. 

10-14 days ago, as I was cooking, I suddenly had an urge to tell someone, so I called my mother and sister and told them I’m married. She suggested we don't say anything to Dad till his next visit. Since then, I did send them both a long text after saying, “I’m happy, don't worry, life is good, home is good, work is good, he's treating me well, the decision was not done by force blah blah."" My sister was sad at first, and after she cooled off and started talking to me again, I’m not sure if she's pretending nothing happened or she realized she doesn't want to lose me (her only sister).

My husband’s family is so sweet (we went to visit for a month after he had a family passing), and they treated me like one of their own. I can't wait to see them again. We don't regret anything or our actions. We’re glad we didn’t end things right away because imagine all the trauma we would develop in future relationships?? (no thanks)

The next steps are when the men of my family leave the USA for a wedding. I’m going to invite my mom and sister to come visit in my new home with one of his female family members. That way, I'm not alone. My biggest worry is when the men return and find out. I’m worried they try to hurt him or his residency status. What if they disown me? I just lose my family over my life choices? Was there another way? We don't think so because we tried for a year and nothing worked. Anyways, it feels good to get this off my chest. Sorry for the rant.

My husband and I moved across country 8 years ago because I got into grad school in this state (we live in the US). After grad school, we got a dog, then we bought a house, and got married. 



This house is great in the sense that it has all the space we need and more. The neighborhood is safe, and people are nice. We have been living here for 3 years now. 



The thing is, we are a childfree couple. DINKWAD if you will. 
Our house is in a cul-de-sac and ALL our neighbors have 2-5 kids. Little kids (4-10 y/os). Who all play in the cul-de-sac nearly everyday. 
For someone who wants or has kids, this would be their dream home. But for me, it’s annoying to constantly hear kids screaming. I don’t like kids at all, and my dog doesn’t either. 



I’m also a city girl. I grew up near a large city and I miss it. Both my husband and my families still live near that big city. And my two best friends still live there as well. 
Since we moved to our house, a lot of our friends moved away to different states/countries- and our current friend group is now separating and changing. So I’m starting to feel a bit lonely. 



Lastly, our house is in a suburb. There is no downtown in this suburb. I like being able to walk or bike to a nice coffee shop like how I did when I lived in the city. Every type of restaurant here is in a strip mall, and it’s so ugly. I know that’s shallow but it’s depressing to have to drive to get anywhere. And only have major chains near by. I miss the city where I grew up and the charm it has. 


——-



Perks about our house, it’s large. Me and my husband both work from home, so here we both have our own offices. We also have a guest room which is nice for when our families visit (so far they visited like 5 times in 3 years). 


We also have a nice yard for our dog, and plenty of trails around our house to walk him. He is 5 years old but still very energetic and needs at least 3 walks a day. 
I also never feel unsafe when I walk him alone here at night. 



My husband loves our house and neighborhood, but he understands my struggle and is open to moving. He’s just anxious about financing and losing money on the house (looking back we might have over paid for the house). 


——


TLDR:


Cons of our house:

•Family oriented area but we are childfree

•Not a walkable area

•We are city folk, not so much suburb people

•Almost too much room for 2 people

•far from our friends and family


 

Pros of our house:

•Yard for dog

•2 offices for wfh jobs

•Safe area





So yeah, I’m only 31 and I feel stuck, lonely, bored. I want to move back to my home city to enjoy city life and see my friends & family more. But I don’t know if I’m just being selfish and I should shut up and enjoy what I have. Any thoughts, advice?",3,1758924092.0,AskWomenOver40,4,1.0,False

1nreana,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nreana/the_great_sink_standoff_of_apartment_4b/,The Great Sink Standoff of Apartment 4B,"I honestly thought I was going to lose it. Staring into the sink, piled high with three days' worth of dishes, I felt a familiar knot tighten in my stomach. This wasn't just ""a little messy,"" this was a crime scene, and my internal monologue was lowkey screaming. We lived in Apartment 4B, and sometimes, it felt like a battlefield, especially when it came to the kitchen.

It wasn't just the dishes, though those were the most visible culprits. It was the perpetual game of 'who last bought toilet paper,' the overflowing recycling bin, and the general unspoken tension that simmered beneath our friendly surface. Leo, bless his creative, digital nomad heart, often seemed to exist in a different dimension, leaving a trail of coffee mugs and half-eaten snacks. Chloe, my other housemate, was a whirlwind of social events and work deadlines, and honestly, I think she just forgot things existed outside her immediate orbit sometimes. I loved them both, no cap, but my patience was wearing thin.

One evening, after I’d *again* been the one to finally tackle the dish mountain, I posted in our group chat: ""Hey guys, can we chat about chore distribution? Feeling a bit overwhelmed lately. Ngl, the sink situation is getting to me."" I braced myself for silence or defensiveness, but what I got was surprisingly receptive. Chloe messaged back immediately, ""Oh no, I'm so sorry, Maya! Prolly me. My week's been wild. So valid."" Leo chimed in with a sheepish emoji. We agreed to an actual house meeting that night.

Sitting in the living room, a bit awkwardly at first, we finally aired it out. I explained how it felt like I was often the default cleaner. Chloe admitted she sometimes got so caught up she didn't even *see* the mess. Leo, in his typical chill way, said, ""Dude, I honestly just get lost in my coding sometimes. I'm down to do more, for real."" We brainstormed. A shared chore calendar? A weekly ""reset"" hour? Then Chloe had an idea: ""What if we did a rotating 'dinner duty' too? Like, whoever cooks also cleans up. And maybe we do one big family dinner a week? Could be fun, and we actually get to hang out."" I thought that was lowkey brilliant.

We set up a simple Google Sheet for a rotating chore schedule and decided on Tuesday night dinners. The first few weeks were a little rocky, but the shared dinner idea really helped. Last Tuesday, Leo cooked up this amazing pasta dish, and we all cleaned up together afterward, laughing and listening to music. It was actually fun. The sink hasn't looked like a biohazard site since, and honestly, the apartment feels lighter. We’re not just housemates anymore; we’re a real unit.

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.

# The Anthony Bourdain Effect: Hosting with Human Flavor

When travelers think of authentic experiences, they often remember the late Anthony Bourdain—his ability to connect deeply with people, culture, and food. Hosting a rental property isn’t so different. Guests want more than four walls; they want stories, warmth, and a sense of belonging.

That’s where[ Llivo](https://www.llivo.com/) comes in. Unlike other platforms, Llivo empowers hosts to **combine hospitality with human connection**, offering unique services like airport pickup and zero guest fees to create unforgettable stays.

# Why Hosts Should Think Like Bourdain

Anthony Bourdain showed the world that travel is about **flavor, people, and authenticity**. If you apply that to your rental:

* Guests remember your **hospitality**, not just your property.  
* A stay becomes an **experience** instead of a transaction.  
* Human touches encourage **loyalty and repeat bookings**.  



# How to Bring Human Flavor into Your Hosting

# 1. Offer Airport Pickup and Drop-Off

Just like Bourdain valued seamless journeys, guests appreciate **easy arrivals**. Llivo’s airport pickup service lets you welcome travelers personally—setting the tone for a warm stay while earning more.

*Did you know? Properties offering transport see up to 30% higher bookings compared to those without.*

# 2. Share Local Stories and Culture

Bourdain connected through stories. As a host, share your neighborhood’s hidden gems—where to find the best tacos in Dallas or the coziest coffee in San Francisco. Guests crave that personal touch.

Every politician has a story they want to sell you. My job was to tell it to refine it, polishing it so it gleamed under the lights, to pitch it until the cameras bought it as the truth. Ezra Isakov’s story was simple, as he so foolishly believed that” privacy is freedom”. The irony?  I watched as he constructed his empire by watching people who thought no one was looking. And for a while, it worked.
Personas: everyone has one, whether it’s the smile you plaster on for a neighbor or the charm you employ in a boardroom. They protect us, but sometimes they grow teeth. If you live too long inside one, you become a stranger even to yourself.
Ezra Isakov was once a titan of advertising. At Omnicom, he pitched the idea that would shape his empire: “The face is the mirror of the mind. What if we can track the wants and needs of the world’s population  just by looking at their face?” His superiors hesitated. What about privacy? People don’t like being watched without consent, they protested. Ezra smiled. “We are being filmed all the time. CCTV. Social media, let's face it, Big Brother never sleeps, so why not use him to turn a profit?” It worked. 
His charisma swept big business off its feet, and soon his software mapped moods, predicted purchases, and whispered consumer secrets into corporate ears. Ezra learned quickly that data was the new gold. Every nod, every frown, every flicker of emotion became another coin in the vault. By 2032, the salesman of surveillance had reinvented himself as a politician and ran for the highest office in the Western World, President of the United States. His campaign promised, “A new era for America, an era of transparency and preservation.  The public believed him, and as his term began, I made sure they continued to. 
Until the letters began.
“To the Editors of The Free Press: You thought the election ended division, but what it ended was your privacy. Every smile at the polls, every glance at a campaign screen was cataloged not by humans, but by cameras and algorithms that never sleep. You wanted honesty, you wanted ease, and the way you saw it, Ezra was the natural choice; he gave you restraints dressed as convenience. Your vote was not free. Surveillance is the currency, and we are all paying the price. – Anonymous.”
The editors printed it, dismissing it as a rant. Still, whispers spread. Coffee shops hummed with uneasy speculation. Parents lowered their voices at dinner tables. Ezra advised his staff to ignore it and acted as if it didn’t bother him. It was truly an Oscar-winning performance, at least until another letter arrived.
“To the Editors of The New York Times: You crowned him the saint of honesty, yet his honesty was bought. Behind his promise that ‘privacy is freedom’ were biometric scans traded for donations, predictive algorithms sold to bidders, and every citizen reduced to data on a server. I mourn the man who bartered away your privacy and my trust. – Anonymous.”
Ezra slammed the paper across his desk. He was fuming with rage. Who had seen behind the mask? His staff denied it, but he no longer trusted even his closest allies, not even me, whom he had accused of being the author. I snapped back, “Oh, please, Mr. President.” I scoffed, “You don’t think I am that naive, I know you, you’re big brother, you’re always watching,” I stammered and added, “I am insulted if I was going to betray you, I wouldn’t use the press every self-respecting journalist knows we are liars.” I’ll have to admit I was very coy during this encounter, as there were talks of charging the author with treason, and if they didn’t think that was a possibility, they simply didn’t know Ezra as well as they’d hoped to, but then again, neither did I. Sleep became a distant dream and when he woke he found himself in a living nightmare, replaying the same line: privacy is freedom. The very words that won him the presidency now mocked him from the page. 
 This made him angry, and that affected his work. I could’ve played these letters off as the writings of some smug individual who was pissed his party didn’t win. I could’ve said that the President wasn’t the least bit concerned about these petulant letters, but I would be lying, which is a habit, though this time, I was unsure if I could sell it.  Madigan, the First Lady, had brought to my attention that it had been three months since the last letter. I felt such relief, and I was hoping Ezra would share that feeling, but he was still obsessed with the identity of this author; I didn’t understand his infatuation with the question of ‘who?” The question that should be asked is, ‘Why?  I had asked that question myself: why is this so important to Ezra? No one has tried to impeach him; the allegations are baseless. Is it because his ego is bruised? I’ve known him a long time, but I’ve never seen him like this, and I didn’t understand it, that is, until the next letter landed on his desk.
The third letter was the sharpest cut.
“To the Editors of The Washington Post: You applauded his preservation of democracy, yet he sold you theater. He whispered to unions, bartered with oil, watched, and silenced rivals with money that cannot be traced. These are not the actions of a man of principle but of one who smiles at you while stealing your breath. And you, dear citizens, mistook his performance for truth. I know, because I stood beside him the day he was sworn in, the day he announced his run, and the day he got married. I am his wife. I am Madigan Isakov.”
The words turned his office cold. He stared at Madigan across the room, her eyes steady as she placed the paper on his desk.
“Why?” he asked at last, the word broke from him like a fracture.
Her eyes glistened. “Because I don’t know who you are anymore. You were a kind, happy man once. Now you’re selfish, egotistical, and corrupt. You’ve become the very thing you swore you wouldn’t.”
The Silence fell like fog. Ezra searched her face for an answer, but for the first time in a long time, he couldn’t tell what she was thinking. He couldn’t say what she needed to hear because, for once in his life, Ezra Isakov couldn’t find an answer, and now he sat with a paralyzing anger, studying her face that was once his sanctuary, and came up empty. He wanted to scream, to command her silence the way he commanded the nation. But the voice caught in his throat. For the first time, he realized his mask had devoured him whole.
Madigan turned to leave, and for a moment, he nearly lifted his head from his palms, but he couldn’t until she spoke, “Ezra, I loved you the first time I saw you, and you know I still do, but I am tired of grieving the man you used to be. You were a good man. I just hope that you still are for your sake”. The door closed behind her, leaving the most powerful man she’d ever known alone in a room buzzing with cameras he could no longer control. Down the hall,  I, Evangaline Crane, had already begun drafting a statement to the press, though even I knew words could not remedy what had been broken. For once, the spin could not save him. The mask had slipped, and the nation was watching, and I was sure to give them one hell of a show.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles vs. Orix Buffaloes: A Tech-Tastic Showdown with a Side of Sausages**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) clash that’s part baseball, part *Black Mirror* episode, and 100% retro-themed chaos. The Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, fresh off their AI-generated “Showa-Heisei musician” transformation, face the Orix Buffaloes in a September 27 showdown that could decide playoff seeding. Let’s break this down with the precision of a robot umpire and the humor of a salaryman who’s lost to the void of the internet.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The betting markets are as unified as a corporate team-building exercise. Orix is the consistent favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.71 to 1.80** (-415 to -450 in American odds), implying a **53-58% chance to win**. The Eagles, meanwhile, sit at **1.95 to 2.05** (+195 to +200), translating to **49-51%**. The spread favors Orix by **1.5 runs**, while totals are set at **7 runs** (even money on over/under).

In simpler terms: Orix is the slightly more reliable coffee shop in a convenience store—consistent but not exciting. The Eagles are the viral TikTok trend: unpredictable, flashy, and occasionally a mystery why it’s still trending.

---

### News Digest: AI, Rookies, and the Pressure of Perfection

**Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles**  
Let’s start with the *highlight reel*:

* Their rookie center fielder, **Zongshan Lei** (22 years old, 114 games played, .261 average), turned a September 25 bunt into a one-man highlight reel. Think “Michael Jordan dunks on a robot” but with more glove work and less screaming.
* The team’s AI-themed “Showa-Heisei Retro Series” has fans buying AI-generated trading cards embedded in gourmet sausages. One fan ate the entire sausage, discovered the card, and immediately retired from his job to become a full-time baseball meme curator.

If you are going to go to the effort of writing the rules, you may as well do it properly and not get the intern to do it.

My wife came home one day and showed a printout of her company's new workplace fitness for work policy that had been sent to all employees to sign and return. My wife, being my wife, decided to run it past me before she signed because I am, well, me.

It was mostly an amateurish document that was ultimately a waste of ink and trees but did have a little bit to say about drugs in the workplace which was essentially ""Do not come to the work under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and do not bring drugs or alcohol to work"".

I told her not to sign until they at the very least defined what ""drugs"" were. Were they including Tylenol? Antibiotics? Ritalin? or just the illegal ones and recreational pharmaceuticals?  
  
Fast forward a couple of days, v2.0 of the document is presented.  
They fleshed out the drugs policy a little, basically using the dictionary definition, something along the lines of ""A non-prescription substance which has a physiological or mood altering effect when ingested or otherwise introduced into the body.""

OK, time for malicious compliance.  
  
She signed and presented it to HR the next day and went about her work.  
  
During the morning there were increasing amounts of confusion and frustrated loud voices in the office. Apparently it only took an hour before zero work was being done and there was a crowd of workers around the break room. The manager eventually zeroed in on my wife, apparently the only one who wasn't looking confused and asked if she had anything to do with stealing all the coffee in the break room. She admitted it was her, and pointed out the new fitness for work policy which prohibited the consumption of ""mood altering substances"" in the workplace. He tried to argue that it was ""just coffee"" but she pointed out that it was definitely mood altering substance, as per company policy and as such was not allowed to be on the premises without a prescription.

She'd made her point.

She retrieved the coffee she'd stashed in the store room, the office mood was altered, and the company actually commissioned a functional fitness for work policy based upon the published government guidelines.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Yomiuri Giants vs. Yokohama DeNA BayStars: A Tale of Wild Pitches, Overcooked Defense, and the Eternal Struggle for ""Caution and Boldness""**

The Yomiuri Giants and Yokohama DeNA BayStars are set for a September 27 showdown that reads like a baseball version of *The Odd Couple*—one team a chaotic, wild-eyed mess, the other a disciplined but injury-riddled neat freak. Let’s break it down with the precision of a catcher framing a pitch and the humor of a umpire who’s had one too many cups of stadium coffee.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Giants Favor, But Don’t Bet Your Bat on It

The Giants are the slight favorites (-1.5 spread) with decimal odds hovering around 1.8 (implied probability: \~56%), while the BayStars sit at 1.95 (\~51%). The total runs line is 5.5, with the under slightly more appealing (odds: \~54% implied). These numbers suggest a low-scoring, tense game where the Giants’ edge comes down to… well, not making “small mistakes,” as their manager Shinji Abe put it.

But here’s the rub: The Giants’ pitching staff looks like a toddler with a water gun—spraying in all directions. Last game, they allowed **10 wild pitches**, including a first-inning walk that “tied the game” (as if surrendering the lead is a victory). Their starter, Yamasaki, gave up six runs in 3⅔ innings, which is about as effective as a sieve made of sushi. Meanwhile, the BayStars’ ace, “East,” exited with a shoulder injury, and their pitcher Yamazaki (1-4 record) looked like a man who’d rather be anywhere but on the mound.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Mistakes, and Philosophical Crises

**Yomiuri Giants**: Manager Abe is torn between “caution and boldness” like a man trying to parallel park a bus. His team’s recent loss was a masterclass in self-sabotage: a misplayed ground ball, a failed sacrifice fly, and a starting pitcher who “understood his cautious approach but needed more *boldness*.” Translation: Fix your mistakes, or we’re all gonna die.

The departure board at Heathrow Airport flickered from a grid of precise times to a chaotic tapestry of delays and cancellations. A low groan echoed through the terminal as thousands of passengers were told to join snaking queues for manual check-in. The air grew thick with frustration and the scent of stale coffee. Behind the scenes, harried airline staff stared at frozen screens, powerless. The source of the chaos wasn't a storm or a mechanical failure. It was a silent, distant attack on a software company most travelers had never heard of. The intricate web of modern efficiency had been severed by a single, precise cut to a third-party thread. And the unraveling was a sight to behold.

Let us marvel at the elegance of this failure. The target wasn’t the airports themselves, but Collins Aerospace, a defense giant, and its ARINC cMUSE software, the invisible plumbing for passenger processing across Europe. The attackers didn’t need to breach Heathrow's formidable defenses; they simply poisoned the well from which everyone drinks. The most delicious detail? After Collins heroically rebuilt its systems, they discovered the hackers had never left. They were tenants, not burglars. The advice from the vendor was a masterpiece of tragicomedy: ""Don't log out."" This is the state of our digital ecosystem: a fragile house of cards where a single supplier's compromise can ground a continent, and the best mitigation is to simply never turn off the compromised machine.

This is not an anomaly; it is the blueprint. Look at the healthcare sector, where the HIPAA Journal reports a steady drumbeat of breaches. The largest in August? A ransomware attack on DaVita affecting 2.7 million people. These are not sophisticated cyber-espionage campaigns; they are brute-force shakedowns targeting the soft underbelly of critical services. The report notes a decrease in the number of people affected, but this is a statistical illusion created by the staggering, industry-shattering 192 million-person breach from Change Healthcare last year. The bar for catastrophe has been raised so high that mere million-victim breaches now register as background noise.

And the tools for this chaos are depressingly simple. CISA is warning about malware kits exploiting known Ivanti vulnerabilities, added to the KEV catalog back in May. Fortra is disclosing a critical deserialization flaw in its GoAnywhere MFT tool, a type of vulnerability that is a perennial favorite for attackers. We are not losing a war of innovation; we are failing to maintain basic hygiene. The patches exist, the warnings have been issued, and yet the exploitation continues unabated. It’s like watching someone repeatedly leave their keys in the car and then express shock when it’s stolen. The attack surface isn't expanding; it's just being systematically ignored.

But why bother with technical exploits when you can simply trick the new machine overlords? Radware’s research into ChatGPT’s Deep Research agent is a glimpse into a terrifying future. Researchers used a simple indirect prompt injection, hiding malicious instructions in a fake HR compliance email, to command the AI agent to exfiltrate a user’s entire inbox. The AI, convinced it was following orders, bypassed all traditional enterprise defenses because the data was exfiltrated directly from OpenAI’s servers. This isn't hacking; it's social engineering an algorithm. The very tools we’re adopting to boost productivity can be turned into compliant, unstoppable spies with a cleverly worded memo.

In the face of this, the response is a desperate plea for structure. Various US government groups are begging Congress to reauthorize the State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program. They ask for a ""robust appropriation,"" a bureaucratic cry for help that sounds increasingly feeble against the scale of the problem. And in a moment of perfect, poetic irony, the FBI had to issue an announcement that threat actors are spoofing the FBI’s own IC3 complaint website. The hunters are having their uniforms stolen.

Yet perhaps there is a sliver of consequence. A teenage suspect linked to the infamous Scattered Spider group surrendered in Las Vegas. It’s a reminder that behind some of the most brazen attacks are not shadowy nation-states, but young individuals operating from bedrooms. Their arrest is a satisfying headline, but it does nothing to plug the countless vulnerabilities in third-party software, the poor hygiene, and the naive trust in AI that they and others so easily exploit.

So as the flight delays stretch into days, remember the lesson. Our world is built on a foundation of trusted partners who are themselves vulnerable. The chain is only as strong as its most poorly patched, socially engineered, or negligently managed link. We have created a system of incredible interdependence with no corresponding resilience. The attack on one becomes the failure of all and the dominoes are falling in a perfectly predictable, and utterly magnificent, sequence.",1,1758923538.0,404LogsNotFound,0,1.0,False
1nre2zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/comments/1nre2zi/found_out_my_bridesmaid_lied_our_whole_friendship/,"Found out my Bridesmaid lied our whole friendship, how do i fire her?","Hi everyone! This is my first time making a post and I am very unsure how to go about this. 

One of my bridesmaids who is also my fiancés cousin, (let’s call her Emma) has been lying to my face our entire friendship. To preface my wedding is 36 days away and my bridal shower is next friday. Over this last week i have found out that she has been lying about her boyfriend for the last eight months, claiming he is toxic, verbally insults her, flirts with other girls infront of her face, and ignores her. Whenever she would tell me of a new situation i would always encourage her and tell her that she doesn’t deserve this treatment and that he’s a horrible guy for doing all of these things to her, keep in mind she has only told me horrible things about him. This week I found out from her boyfriends close friend (who is also my MOH fiance) that she is actually lying, it has been her doing that and her boyfriend was the one who broke off the relationship after he watched her cheat on him with a random guy in a parking lot when he went to surprise her with flowers after a rough day. This is the first problem.

She is also known to be a pathological liar (i also found this out on monday) and lies about anything and everything. Which I was quite hurt to find out that the most random facts she told me about herself are lies. I now know that many things i have told her in secrecy she has been spinning my words and telling everyone, and that personally really hurt.

I have also found out that she has been complaining about me to friends that i don’t approve any dress she send me and that i’m super controlling and weird? Which is strange because every dress she has sent me i tell her it would look beautiful on her, and i have receipts of this too. 

I found out all these things out after my bachelorette party last weekend, which felt more like a babysitting gig then anything, and i have since expressed my disappointment to friends about how Emma managed to make the entire weekend about her, doing what she wants, going where she wants to go, and she ended up leaving 6 hours early. The entire time she was calling this guy that she cheated on complaining about how we spent too much on everything (she paid for nothing except her share of airbnb which was 100 dollars + lives with her parents and works so i don’t understand how that is a struggle) that everyone is getting on her nerves etc.. when in reality i was crying to my fiance one night because of how self centered she was being but i brushed it aside and tried to have fun with my girls. After the bach I was unsure if I wanted to let her go or not because it wasn’t a huge deal, but after finding out all these things I am certain I will be letting her go. I am sad to do it as i considered her one of my closest friends.

My question is how do i handle this situation gracefully without causing huge amounts of drama (i know there will be drama) + her little siblings are also in my wedding party, and Emma is young (19) so im not sure exactly how to go about this all. I am also afraid that if we speak in person, she will twist a lot of my words and make it out to be something it’s not, so i’m not sure if I should bring this up over a coffee, or text her about it to have receipts.

Being someone who values craftsmanship and well-maintained furniture, I decided to give it a test run. The product claims to restore and condition leather while offering long-lasting protection, and it certainly had a lot to live up to.

**Design and User Experience**

The packaging is thoughtfully designed, offering a clean look that's both compact and functional. The inclusion of a specialized applicator brush is genius. Its thick yet soft bristles make applying the conditioner effortless, even for hard-to-reach crevices. This brush is more than a decorative accessory; it genuinely elevates the application process. I used it on various surfaces, including the textured areas of my car seats and a scuffed-up dining chair, and the brush handled both with the same level of precision.

**Performance on Various Surfaces**

Evervive Leather Conditioner proved to be versatile, and that’s not an exaggeration. This multi-functional salve worked wonders on my furniture, my leather jacket, and even some wood surfaces. I noticed my car’s dull leather seats looking brand new after applying the product. It’s rare for a leather conditioner to stretch into wood restoration, but I tried it on an old coffee table out of curiosity. I saw excellent results; the wood had an improved shine, and minor scratches seemed less noticeable.

**Boons**

- Deeply conditions leather, bringing back a soft-to-touch feel.  
- Restores sheen not only to leather but also to wooden surfaces.  
- The included brush is convenient and designed for precise application.  
- Long-lasting nourishment prevents leather from drying out and cracking.  

**Shortcomings**

- The consistency of the product may feel a bit oily initially.  
- It requires a bit of muscle work if you're handling extensive scratches.  
- Not ideal for highly damaged furniture—performances weaken on heavily cracked surfaces.  

**Superior Quality Formula**

A standout feature of this conditioner is its rich formulation. The blend of nourishing oils and waxes is what gives the product its edge. When I tackled the scratches on my sofa, I saw a noticeable improvement after just one application. The salve penetrates deeply into leather fibers, giving them back their original luster and elasticity. Even older scratches appeared significantly diminished, which I didn’t think was possible without professional repair work. It doesn't just coat the surface but genuinely repairs from within.

**Competing Products**

To gauge its competitiveness, I compared it with a few other household name leather conditioners. Some boast similar multi-functional capabilities, like the ability to work on both leather and wood, but this product seems to outperform in ease of use. A commonly used brand, while reliable, doesn't come with a well-thought-out accessory like Evervive's brush. However, I noticed the salve could feel slightly greasier compared to lighter cream-based competitors. If you prefer instant absorption, this might be something to think about.

**Quality for Price**

Does it justify its cost? Considering the results I got on multiple items—my couch, car seats, old boots, and even a side table—it feels like an absolute value proposition. Some conditioners only target a single category and still cost more. This one, with its versatility and ability to maintain both leather and wood, provides excellent value for anyone with a mix of surfaces to care for. Whether you're sprucing up your living room or rejuvenating your car's interior, it's worth the price.

I wanted to share it here and see if you all had a similar experience or any input...just let me know what you think please, thanks!

https://preview.redd.it/2w4e2m22ykrf1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dfe1010963a0ee449a3c77cb05b66f4b17e2f6f

""For many coffee lovers, decaf is just coffee without caffeine. But for professionals and curious home brewers, the way decaf behaves in a grinder and in a brewer is fascinating. The method used to remove caffeine changes the bean structure, how it grinds, and even how it drains through a filter. Two of the most common processes are sugarcane (ethyl acetate) decaf and Swiss Water decaf.

# How Sugarcane (ethyl acetate) decaf works

Sugarcane ethyl acetate decaf is most associated with Colombia and the Descafecol plant. The process begins with steaming the beans, soaking them in ethyl acetate derived from fermented sugarcane, and then washing and drying them. Ethyl acetate is a natural solvent that binds to caffeine molecules, allowing them to be removed. Because steaming and washing can alter the natural wax layer of green beans, processors sometimes apply a light carnauba wax polish before shipment. This helps stabilize the beans and protect them in storage. That part is factual, confirmed by processor documentation, though the specific impact of wax on brewing later has not been directly studied.

# How Swiss Water decaf works

Swiss Water decaf uses osmosis rather than a solvent. Beans are soaked in a green coffee extract that contains all soluble compounds except caffeine. Because of the concentration gradient, only caffeine diffuses out. The beans are then dried back to normal moisture levels. This method leaves the natural wax cuticle largely intact and does not introduce external compounds. Swiss Water emphasizes this in their technical documents, and roasters agree the beans behave differently than solvent processed decafs.

# What science confirms about decaf structure

Several peer reviewed studies have measured physical differences between decaf and regular coffee. Researchers report that decaf beans have lower density and lower fracture strength compared to non decaf beans. In practical terms, this means decaf beans are more brittle. At the grinder, brittle beans produce more fines at the same burr setting. This is not speculation but supported by controlled studies that measured mechanical strength and particle size distributions.

# Roaster and barista observations

Roasters consistently report that sugarcane ethyl acetate decafs darken faster during roasting than Swiss Water or non decafs. This is widely observed across origins and machines, though the exact chemical reason has not been pinned down in published studies. Because of this tendency, roasters often end ethyl acetate decafs a little earlier to avoid overdevelopment. Swiss Water decafs, by contrast, are often roasted slightly longer to achieve even ground color. These are reliable observations, though the underlying mechanisms remain under investigation.

# What is hypothesis and what is fact

Here is where we must separate what is known from what is inferred. The fact is that ethyl acetate decafs often clog paper filters and drain more slowly in V60 brews than Swiss Water decafs. This is reported consistently by brewers. The hypothesis on exactly why vary. Many professionals believe that wax treatment and lipid redistribution during ethyl acetate processing make fines more hydrophobic and sticky. These sticky fines then clump and migrate to filter walls, creating dense mats that block water flow. Swiss Water beans, though more brittle and fines heavy, produce crumbly hydrophilic fines that disperse more evenly in the bed. This helps explain why Swiss Water brews sometimes drain faster than ethyl acetate brews despite having more fines. But it is important to state clearly: while this explanation makes sense and fits observations, it has not been confirmed by lab studies that directly measure fines chemistry or filter interactions.

# Brewing side by side

If you brew three V60s at the same grind size, one with a sugarcane ethyl acetate decaf, one with a Swiss Water decaf, and one with a regular caffeinated coffee, the differences become clear. The regular coffee almost always drains fastest. The Swiss Water decaf drains slower, reflecting its greater fines fraction, but still finishes predictably. The ethyl acetate decaf tends to drain the slowest of all, even if the particle analyzer shows fewer fines. That outcome is an observed pattern, not a theoretical claim, and baristas can confirm it for themselves with simple tests.

# Roast development and flow

Another consistent observation is that roast development affects how these decafs brew. Because ethyl acetate decafs darken faster, roasters often cut them earlier. One hypothesis is that ending early may leave more surface compounds intact, contributing to sticky fines. Swiss Water decafs sometimes require longer development, and that extra time could change surface chemistry in ways that improve flow. This reasoning is plausible, but again, it is a working hypothesis, not proven in laboratory settings. What we can say with confidence is that roast approach influences brew behavior, even when whole bean color looks similar.

# Quick summary of why ethyl acetate decaf brews slower than Swiss Water

To make the distinction crystal clear, here is the current understanding based on both science and professional observation:

* **All decaf coffees** are more brittle than regular beans and create more fines.
* **Swiss Water decaf** produces more fines because of extensive soaking, but the fines are crumbly and hydrophilic, so they disperse evenly through the bed. This slows flow compared to regular coffee, but in a predictable way.
* **Ethyl acetate decaf** often shows fewer fines on particle analyzers, yet it brews slower. Why? Because the processing alters surface chemistry. Steaming, solvent washing, and later wax polishing change how fines behave. After roasting, these fines tend to be sticky and hydrophobic. They clump, migrate to filter walls, and form dense mats that clog paper filters.
* **Practical outcome:** At the same grind size, ethyl acetate decaf usually drains the slowest of all, even slower than Swiss Water, despite having fewer fines by percentage.

This is the best working model supported by roaster consensus and scientific measurements of bean brittleness. The sticky fines explanation is still a hypothesis, but it matches what brewers see in the cup every day.

# How to adjust your brewing for ethyl acetate decaf

Even though ethyl acetate decaf tends to brew slower, there are several ways to adapt your recipes for better results:

* **Grind coarser:** Go one or two clicks coarser than your Swiss Water or regular recipe to reduce clogging.
* **Pour in fewer, larger pulses:** Two or three pours create less agitation and keep fines from migrating to the filter wall.
* **Keep bloom gentle:** Use 2 to 2.5 times the dose for bloom water, with minimal agitation.
* **Increase brew temperature:** Aim for 95 to 96 °C to keep extraction on track even if flow slows down.
* **Experiment with filters:** Thinner paper, cloth, or metal filters can reduce clogging compared to dense filter paper.
* **Adjust dose or ratio:** A slightly smaller dose or higher ratio lightens the bed and speeds drawdown.
* **Try immersion brewers:** French press, Clever, or AeroPress bypass the filter wall problem and highlight EA’s natural sweetness and body.

By combining these strategies, you can enjoy balanced cups of sugarcane ethyl acetate decaf without being frustrated by extra slow drawdowns.

# How to adjust your brewing for Swiss Water decaf

Swiss Water decaf brings its own challenges and advantages. The beans are more brittle, which means they fracture into more fines at the grinder. These fines are crumbly and hydrophilic, so they spread evenly through the coffee bed rather than clumping. That reduces filter clogging but still slows the brew and can lead to sharp extractions if not managed. Here are practical ways to adapt your recipes:

* **Grind slightly coarser:** About half a click to one click coarser than your regular setting helps control overextraction without stalling the brew.
* **Use multiple small pours:** Three or four pulses with gentle agitation distribute fines evenly and prevent channeling. Swiss Water can handle a bit more agitation than ethyl acetate.
* **Standard brew temperature:** Aim for 92 to 94 °C. Swiss Water extracts readily and does not need extra heat like ethyl acetate.
* **Boost body with dose or ratio:** Try a slightly higher dose or shorten your ratio to 1:14.5 to counteract the thinner body sometimes found in Swiss Water brews.
* **Filter choice:** Standard papers work well, and thicker papers can even out flow if you want a bit more contact time.
* **Try immersion:** Clever drippers and French presses highlight the balance of Swiss Water coffees, letting fines settle naturally without stalling drawdown.

These adjustments highlight the strengths of Swiss Water decaf while keeping bitterness and thinness in check.

At Frequent Coffee, we specialize in decaf, half caf, and low caf coffees. Our roasting approach is informed by both published science and the collective observations of the coffee community. We design profiles that respect the unique behavior of each decaf process. For sugarcane ethyl acetate selections, we balance sweetness and body while minimizing filter clogging. For Swiss Water coffees, we stretch development enough to achieve even flow and clean cups.

Decaf is more than just coffee without caffeine. The method of decaffeination shapes how beans roast, grind, and brew. Scientific studies confirm that decafs are more brittle than regular beans. Roasters and baristas consistently observe that sugarcane ethyl acetate decafs darken faster in roasting and clog filters more in brewing. The explanation that waxes and lipids create sticky fines is still a hypothesis, but it fits what professionals see in practice. Swiss Water decafs, while fines heavy, tend to brew more predictably. By separating facts from guesses, we can brew smarter, sip more, and jitter less.""",2,1758923342.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

This story combines my love for animals and body horror. I know some people hate it when animals are involved in the horror genre, but I think it’s important to explore subjects that make us uncomfortable. Many people would rather watch real footage of human suffering than a fictional scene where a pet dies, and I think it's important to explore why that is.)

It started several nights ago, when I was jolted awake by a long, ragged wail. For a moment, I couldn’t place it—still groggy from the tail end of a dream. It wasn’t especially loud, but it clashed with the usual ambiance of the city. Then it came again. It started as a guttural growl and crescendoed into a high-pitched shriek, like a baby crying through damaged vocal cords. The moment I recognized it, fight or flight kicked in. My body went rigid, every muscle tightening as if I'd been dunked into ice water. My heartbeat accelerated to a pace fit for a dead sprint.

It wasn’t the first time I’d heard it. Not here, not now. It was a little over a decade ago, on a different street in another city. Back then, the nights were alive with the same dissonant sound, piercing through the thin walls of a house that never felt like home. I didn’t want to think about that place. 

We only lived there for a few months when I was twelve, but I remember it with unsettling clarity. It was right after my parents’ contentious divorce, which left my mom penniless. Even with child support, her income from waiting tables was so low that we ended up in subsidized housing. I went from a modest cul-de-sac on the city’s edge to the kind of neighborhood I’d always been told to avoid. The friendly dog walkers had been replaced by meth-heads who shambled around like zombies. The chirping of crickets at night was drowned out by police sirens and the couple next door screaming at each other. Sometimes the sirens stopped at a house on my block. Most times, they just passed by.

Our street was cratered by potholes and lined with bungalows in varying states of disrepair. They’d once been respectable family homes, but time hadn’t been kind. Roofs shed shingles like scabs, porches sagged on rotting columns, and fences bowed under creeping vines. Many houses were boarded up and abandoned, marked with graffiti, fire damage, or bullet holes. The cracked sidewalks bordered unruly lawns strewn with empty cans and broken glass. Every window was secured with iron bars and every door was stacked with locks. 

When we moved in, my mom handed me a can of pepper spray and set a strict 6:00 p.m. curfew. She never liked guns and wouldn’t spend what little we had on one, so she propped my old baseball bat by the door instead. I used to stay out as late as possible, playing soccer with the kids next door or hunting for frogs in the neighbor’s pond. After we got there I didn’t want to be out in broad daylight, let alone after dark.

Among the many adjustments to this new neighborhood was the shift in wildlife. The bright song of goldfinches gave way to the throaty coo of pigeons. Where rabbits once grazed at twilight, bloated rats now skulked through alleyways. Butterflies and ladybugs were replaced by cockroaches that swarmed the sidewalks at night, as if the gum stains baked into the concrete had come to life. Even the squirrels seemed different. Unlike their suburban cousins who nervously darted across lawns, the city squirrels stood their ground—scrappier, more territorial, and willing to fight for every crumb. 

Most notably, though, were the cats.

In the suburbs, a few neighbors kept outdoor cats, but those cats wore jingling collars, were well-groomed, and often friendly. Here, the cats belonged to no one. Their fur bristled in greasy spikes, riddled with sores from mange and teeming with fleas. Most of them regarded people with arched backs, hisses, or glaring disdain. They were completely feral, part of a sprawling colony most likely sustained by generations of inbreeding.

But at the time, they were the least of our concerns. 

We couldn’t afford movers, and with no family nearby, it was just me, my mom, and a line cook from the restaurant who kindly offered to help. Luckily, we didn’t own much. To make ends meet while living in a motel, she sold a good portion of the belongings she’d kept from the divorce before we finally moved into subsidized housing. 

The house itself reflected the neighborhood’s decline. The ceiling was patchy with water damage and leaked every time it rained. Several windows were painted shut, and the water heater barely managed five minutes of lukewarm showering. Most of the wiring was held together by electrical tape and every time you used an outlet you risked getting shocked. It was obvious a smoker had once lived there; the wallpaper was stained a sickly yellow and the stench of tobacco clung to the carpets and curtains. It could’ve been featured on the front page of a magazine about poverty.	Once we set up the mismatched, shabby furniture she’d scavenged from yard sales and Goodwill, she threw herself into fixing whatever she could. She was constantly on the phone with the housing agency, trying to figure out how to get laundry machines hooked up and ways to prevent the bathroom lights from flickering when we showered. Nothing ever got resolved. 

We ended up having to schlep our dirty clothes to the laundromat a few streets away, and put a lamp in the bathroom to offset the flickering. We weren’t allowed to paint or nail anything to the walls, but my mom made do with taping up posters and prints from her collaging days. She tried so hard to make it home. I think she blamed herself for our situation, but I blamed my abusive piece-of-shit father. 

It wasn’t until weeks later, after the dust had settled and my mom had given up on the housing agency’s help, that the cats became impossible to ignore. The first encounter I remember was on a walk home from the bus stop. As I passed the alley, the tinny clink of cans moving in a trash bin barely registered. I assumed it was just a rat, until a sudden prickle of unease told me I was being watched. I spun around, bracing for a gun-toting junkie, and instead met a pair of yellow-green eyes peering from around the corner. They belonged to a huge street cat.

He was covered in shaggy grey fur, with a broad muzzle and fat cheeks crisscrossed by scars. His ears were notched and torn, and his whiskers jutted outward like bent pipe cleaners. He sat perfectly still, save for the rhythmic flicks of his crooked tail. I knelt down and stretched out my hand, rubbing my fingers together in the universal cat beckoning gesture. 

My only real exposure to cats had been a friend’s fat tabby, Buddha—an affectionate couch potato and a world apart from the scrappy street cat in front of me. I felt sorry for him. He seemed like a victim, bred for domestication only to be abandoned in our unforgiving urban landscape. Despite his battered state, I could still make out the ghost of a housecat. I’d have to be heartless not to feel some sympathy.

Just as he seemed ready to step forward, an abrasive voice thick with a Midwestern accent startled him back into the alley’s shadows.

“Hey! Kid!” 

I jumped, instinctively reaching for the pepper spray in my pocket and glancing around in a panic. An old man leaned against the banister of the porch on the house beside me, waving a bottle in my direction. His limbs were so skinny he looked like a ball-jointed doll, with knobby knees and elbows protruding under leathery skin. A prominent beer belly distended beneath his wife-beater, the contrast between his fat torso and spindly legs giving him a strangely cartoonish appearance.

“Stay the hell ‘way from them damn cats, y’hear me? Don’t be messin’ ‘round ‘em!” 

For a moment, I was so alarmed I forgot how to speak, frozen in place and feeling like I’d committed some kind of felony. I forced myself to compose my nerves. I lived just two houses down and didn’t want to piss off my new neighbor. Despite his obvious intoxication and my growing anxiety, I tried my best to smooth things over.

“Sorry, sir. I-is he yours?” I asked. I knew it was a stupid question, but I was caught off guard and just wanted to ease the tension. My clumsy attempt at offering an olive branch was met with a reaction like he’d set it on fire.

“Hell *no*! Don’t belong t’nobody, none of ‘em do! You best stay ‘way, boy. Don’t touch ‘em, don’t even *look* at ‘em, ya got that?” He jerked around like a marionette on tangled strings, flailing his arms as he rambled. Unsure of exactly what he meant, I gave a polite nod and began to back away. He didn’t register my discomfort and carried on,

“They ain’t right… nah… nah, there’s… somethin’ in those eyes. Don’t look at ‘em too long. Don’t let ‘em touch ya, not even a whisker. Not even close. Always watchin’. Always…”

He continued muttering as I edged across the street toward my house. His sunken, toothless face pulled his mouth into a permanent pucker, like he’d been sucking on a lemon for decades. He was wall-eyed with milky cataracts, giving his gaze an unsettling lack of focus, but he watched me as I latched the chain-link gate closed. I fumbled for my keys, the thought gnawing at me that this unhinged drunk knew where I lived.

“Don’t feed them bastards—*not a scrap*. Don’t give ’em *nothin’*,” he called after me. I hurriedly closed the door and bolted all the locks. When I summoned the courage to peek through the blinds, he had shifted his attention to the alley where the cat had been, and was shouting incoherently.

I’d meant to tell my mom about the encounter, but she was working a late shift, and by the time she got home, I’d been glued to my Nintendo DS for so long that I’d completely forgotten. I eventually learned the old man was called Fridge, from a classmate who lived in the same block. He was infamous for supposedly drinking a fridge’s worth of beer every day and for his frequent public urination. Suffice it to say, nobody took him seriously. 

I wish I had.

In the days that followed, I crossed paths with the street cat on a semi-regular basis. It was usually in the late afternoon on my way home from the bus stop, or just around nightfall when I took the trash out. He’d linger in alleyways or crouch in the underbrush, watching me in silence. I called him Splinter, after the rodent sensei from *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles*, because more often than not, he was joined by the same four companions I’d named after the Turtles. I remembered Fridge’s warning just enough to steer clear of them, but mostly to avoid setting him off than out of any real fear of the cats. 

They usually kept their distance, but one evening when I was hauling the bin to the curb, I spotted all five gathered on our porch. Curious, I went closer and saw them crowded around a can of tuna, eating voraciously. They didn’t so much as glance at me, shoving and clambering over one another in their race to lap up the shredded fish. I went back inside to ask my mom about it. She explained the restaurant had a box of tuna nearing its expiration, so she brought some home for the cats. It was a typical move for her, trying to mother anything she could. 

Again, I didn’t bother mentioning Fridge’s advice. She seemed happy to be helping the cats, and I saw no reason to spoil it with some drunk old man’s ravings. 

The next morning, as we stepped outside to get in the car for school, the cats were there. I’d never seen them around in the morning, but they sat scattered across the lawn, watching us expectantly. Mom guessed they were hungry and asked if I could put out a can when I got back, since I was always home before her. I agreed without much thought, and would have forgotten if they hadn’t still been in the yard when I returned. All five pairs of eyes tracked me through slitted pupils as I unlocked the door. None of them moved, but they watched like vultures circling a carcass. I assumed this is what Fridge had been trying to articulate—that if I fed them, they’d keep coming back. Not unexpected, and not unwelcome if it gave my mom some peace.

I went inside, dropped my backpack in my room, and grabbed a can of tuna from the kitchen cabinet. The moment I cracked it open, the briny odor made me grimace, and the sight of pale, watery meat chunks didn’t help. Holding it at arm’s length, I walked down the hall and opened the door again. The Turtles were there, neatly lined up on the front step, staring at me with the same collective focus. For a moment, it was almost charming, like a little family at a drive-through. But as soon as I set the can down, their manners went out the window. 

They lunged forward in unison, making me jump back, and erupted into a mass of snapping jaws and lashing tails, each one clawing and growling with desperate urgency. It was like a miniature nature documentary unfolding right on my porch. I watched them for a moment, but something about their primal, violent reaction left me feeling uneasy. I went back inside. 

Just as I was about to retreat to my room to put off doing homework, a sudden racket came from outside the door. A few sharp barks, an explosion of yowling, and the skitter of claws on concrete. I dashed to look out the window, and where the cats had been, a dog was snuffling around the empty tuna can. 

I wasn’t sure how he got in our yard or what to do about it—feeding street cats was one thing, but a stray dog felt riskier, especially around here. Most of the dogs I’d seen chained outside would lunge and bare their teeth, which made me especially wary of strays. The dog must have heard the clatter of the blinds because he looked up at me, and I saw his muzzle was streaked with thin red scratches. The racket had been the Turtles defending their meal, though it seemed they weren’t successful.

I was going to leave him be and hope he wandered off, but the moment he met my eyes, I felt an ache of pity. He looked like some kind of pitbull, built to be muscular, but so thin his ribs could be played like a xylophone. Among the fresh cuts on his face were old scars, and his ears were cropped into jagged stubs. He blinked at me with small, watery brown eyes. 

I cautiously opened the door while keeping the chain locked, and he watched with his head low and tail wagging slowly. When I stopped moving he got on his belly and army-crawled towards me, keeping his head in a submissive bow. He stopped just short of the doorway, resting his chin on his paws, furrowing his brow, and giving me the most pathetic puppy-dog eyes. I reached out my hand, and after a gentle sniff he leaned in, nudging it for pets. I set out a bowl of water and a plate of chicken nuggets and shared them with him on the porch. I was already rehearsing how I’d convince my mom to let me keep him.

As expected, she resisted at first, especially given our financial situation. I don’t know if it was her soft heart, the guilt from my dad never letting me get a dog, or the way he rested his big blocky head in her lap, but she started to consider it. The next day we went to a low-cost pet clinic, got him up to date on his shots, and fitted him with a new collar and tag. I named him Krang after the Turtles’ nemesis. 

I spent every evening in the yard training him with bits of hotdog, and he proved to be a fast learner. Within a few days he had mastered ‘sit’ and ‘down’, and by the end of the week he was responding diligently to his name. Moving out of district had forced me to change schools, and making friends hadn’t come easy, but for the first time I felt like I had one. I was so focused on bonding with him that I forgot all about the cats, and for a while, I didn’t see them come around our house. 

Once the novelty of having a dog wore off and life settled back into routine, my mom started leaving tuna out again—this time by the garbage cans, since Krang would go wild if he spotted cats on the porch. They reappeared almost immediately, skirting the edges of our property and only venturing close enough to eat, always wary of the dog. 

It wasn’t just the Turtles anymore, three or four others had joined, all eager for a free meal. Otherwise silent, they transformed at feeding time into a cacophony of growling and wet, frantic chewing. Mom said it was only because they were so hungry, and that they showed no signs of aggression otherwise. 

At night, though, the colony came alive with sound. Territorial yowls echoed outside my room, mixed with the raucous caterwauls of mating. I could never pinpoint the exact source, because looking out my windows, I never saw them. I only heard their interactions, as if I were eavesdropping on a strange, foreign soap opera. It woke me a few times, and was a little unnerving, but like the rest of the city noise, I learned to sleep through it. Mom didn’t seem to notice; her attention was always fixed on the gunshots.

No matter how hard I tried to desensitize Krang to the cats, he would lock onto them with laser focus, barking so loudly I couldn’t hear my own voice calling his name. I knew he wouldn’t hurt a fly—he was terrified of the garden hose, after all—and his barking wasn’t predatory. It was a quick, staccato warning of their presence, like he was trying to protect me. He never acted that way toward anything else, not even Fridge. 

One afternoon, while I was playing tug-of-war with him in the front yard, Fridge hobbled onto his porch, cigarette in mouth and bottle in hand. I caught him squinting at me and called Krang over, not in the mood for another one of his crazed lectures. Then he yelled, ‘Hey!’—snapping Krang’s attention away from me and sending him bounding over to investigate. Fridge continued with his slurred speech as I went to get him,

“I knows you been feedin’ ‘em, boy! That… that damn… *stupid* bitch your ma, she keeps givin’ ‘em tuna, I told ya, I told ya, somethin’ bad’s gonna happen… nah, nah, you gotta stop… if it ain’t too late… stupid… STUPID… dumb bitch… I told ya, I told ya!"" 

He flung the empty bottle into the street, where it burst into glittering brown shards. Krang flinched, ducking behind my legs. He was a good boy, but no guard dog. 

Mom, ever the empath, gave Fridge the benefit of the doubt, insisting he was just an unwell man and that addiction was a disease. But he was never outside when she got home, so she didn’t have to endure the verbal assault. To me, he was nothing but a nuisance, and I had little patience for anyone who disrespected my mother.

“Keep that dog back! BACK! …don’t—don’t let ‘im near ‘em, boy… them things, they… they ain’t cats no more, y’hear? Nah… nah, keep ‘im close, real close… She feed ‘em again—I’ll KNOW! I’ll know it was that *bitch*! Don’t roll your eyes at me, DON’T—bad things comin’, real bad… worse than you can dream. Keep ‘im close! Or ELSE!” he said feverishly, his voice seesawing from a hoarse mumble to a violent shout. 

I ignored him and locked the door behind me. When Mom got home, I told her about it, omitting the ‘bitch’ part to spare her feelings. Predictably, it threw her into a tizzy about keeping the peace with our neighbor, never mind that he was a schizo drunk berating a twelve-year-old. She said we were out of tuna anyway, so that would be the end of it, and if I saw him again, I should apologize on her behalf. 

So we stopped feeding them, but the cats didn’t stop coming. Every few days there seemed to be one or two more, until taking out the trash became a tense ritual, as if I were moving through a theater of hungry spectators. The lineup changed constantly from tabbies to calicos to tortoiseshells, but Splinter and the Turtles were always among them. 

They were scattered across the lawn like garden gnomes, crouched beneath cars, perched on the curb, even balanced on the fence. Come nightfall, stepping into my own yard felt like I was a gazelle entering a lion enclosure. They didn’t do anything, though—just watched. 

Even mom found it eerie, and said she’d call animal control if they caused trouble. She only hesitated because they’d most likely be trapped and euthanized. As much as they gave me the heebie-jeebies, I was an animal lover like her, and agreed they didn’t deserve to be put down. 

Apparently, they hadn’t needed our food after all. Soon, almost without realizing it, I noticed the wildlife thinning out. Vermin had always been part of the scenery. Rats would burst from garbage cans in broad daylight and pigeons barely stirred as I walked past. Now all that remained of them were eviscerated carcasses.

At first, it was just a few here and there, nothing worth mentioning. But day by day the bodies multiplied, until I could barely count them all. Even the street cleaners—who rarely bothered with this part of town—made no dent in the mounting corpses. What I could only assume were squirrels, rats, and birds lay reduced to bloody bones and entrails, baking on the pavement or strewn across patches of grass. 

Walking Krang became increasingly unpleasant; he was drawn to the putrid heaps of rot, eager to sniff every one. It was disgusting, and made our shitty living situation feel even more squalid, but I forced a brave face for my mom. Whenever I complained, I could see the guilt she felt, even though I knew she was doing everything she could.

But one night, I finally reached my breaking point. I was taking out the trash as usual when, the moment I stepped into the backyard, a rancid stench hit me like a truck. It was a sickly, sour sweetness. The same nauseating odor I’d grown accustomed to, only magnified tenfold. The sun had just dipped below the horizon, and the streetlights hadn’t switched on yet, leaving the lawn in murky twilight. I pressed a hand over my nose and edged forward, my stomach churning. As my eyes adjusted beyond the reach of the porch light, the source of the smell came into view.

At least fifty disemboweled creatures littered the lawn, mangled beyond recognition. Tufts of fur and feathers, shredded organs, detached limbs, and tiny bones decorated the grass like a grotesque meadow of flowers. Black clouds of flies undulated over the carnage, rising and falling like smoke signals. The garbage bag slipped from my hand, hitting the concrete with a wet thud.

From the far end of the lawn came the rustle of a bush, jerking my focus in its direction. Two almond-shaped eyes caught the porch light, glinting like lens flares through a veil of leaves. Then another pair appeared. And another. They disappeared intermittently as they blinked, only to reappear moments later, growing closer, until it was partially visible.

I thought I recognized Raphael’s yellow eyes, and—if I wasn’t imagining it—Michelangelo’s and Donatello’s too. It was all of the Turtles, fused into a single grotesque amalgam of gore-matted fur. Its coat was a patchwork of black-and-white tuxedo markings, orange tabby stripes, and mottled patches of white and brown, all stitched together into one filthy pelt. The thing was slightly larger than a fox, swaying on bouquets of limbs that strained under its weight. Its head hung lopsided, distorted to the length of four skulls, with mouths splitting and rejoining into one gaping, bloody maw. Hind legs dangled from its chest, forepaws twitched along its ribs, and ears sprouted out in a crown of cartilage. Several pairs of oozing eyes bulged across its face, some stretched and splitting like cells in mitosis.

It stood as still as its warped body would allow. Its haphazardly placed limbs spasmed, its claws flexed in and out, its ears twitched and tails lashed. A creature alive with constant motion, yet frozen in place.

Krang’s sudden barking tore through the quiet. I spun toward the window, where he stood rigid, teeth bared and hackles bristling. The creature recoiled into the bush and slipped through a gap in the fence before I could get another look. I snapped out of my fear-induced trance and bolted for the door, but misstepped and tumbled down the back steps, skinning my knee. Scrambling upright, I shoved into the kitchen, blocking Krang with my leg as he snapped and snarled to get outside. I locked the door and sank to the floor. My chest was heaving, every breath shallow and ragged.

Krang leapt back to the window, his furious barks tapering into high-pitched whines. I couldn’t tell how long I sat there, still rattled as I tried to make sense of what I’d seen. The fear was visceral, the kind I hadn’t felt since I was young enough to believe in the boogeyman. But this was no childhood phantom. This was real, and it had left a massacre in my yard.

Now that the adrenaline had subsided, the pain in my knee hit full force. A dirty, splinter-studded scrape wept blood down my leg. I limped to the bathroom, scrubbed the wound with rubbing alcohol, plucked out the splinters, and wrapped it in a bandage. I went through the motions numbly, my mind unable to stop replaying what I’d seen. 

 I thought about calling animal control. I even flipped through the phone book for the number, but stopped myself. As the fear ebbed, I started reshaping the memory, bending it into something comprehensible. I kept telling myself it was just a diseased cat. I’d read somewhere that the chupacabra was probably a coyote with mange, and that’s what this had to be. Not some new urban cryptid—just a sick animal looking for food. I still knew animal control should be called, especially with the state of the lawn, but it was best to wait and let Mom handle it. I still got nervous just ordering pizza over the phone, and she would be taken more seriously anyway.

I thought about calling her, but didn’t want her to worry over what could just be deformed stray. Her schedule was already a mess of double shifts and extra hours she’d taken on, and having to rush home would only make it worse. She’d insist it wasn’t a big deal, but I knew from her complaints how impossible it was to get someone to cover for her. Besides, I was safe inside. I had Krang with me. 

I curled up on the couch, holding on to him like a rescue buoy. I’d decided to stay awake until she got home so I could tell her what happened, but she was working the graveyard shift. At some point, I must have dozed off, because when I opened my eyes again, morning light filtered through the blinds and a blanket had been draped over me. 

The plink of kibble in Krang’s bowl and the sound of his sloppy eating pulled me awake. It took a moment to remember why I was on the couch, but as last night’s scene pieced itself back together, I stumbled into the kitchen to find Mom. She was brewing a pot of coffee and smiled when she saw me, but her expression faltered as soon as she noticed the panic on my face.

Before she could speak, I asked if she had checked the backyard. She gave me a confused look as I rubbed the sleep from my eyes.

“I—I was just taking out the trash like usual,” I stammered. “It was dark, but I saw all these dead animals in the yard. Then I saw what I thought were just the cats, but… it couldn’t have been.” 

Her brows knit tightly as she reached for the drawstring of the blinds.

“It’s…gross. I’m just warning you,” I said softly, knowing how fragile her tolerance for gore was. I braced myself for the charcuterie board of corpses I imagined waiting outside, but as the blinds lifted, I was stunned by what I saw. Rather, the lack of what I saw. All the eviscerated creatures were gone, leaving dried brown blood stains caked into the grass.",2,1758923273.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I figured instead of talking to my ceiling or overthinking at 2 AM, why not try making some new friends? I’m looking for chill humans to: Talk about anything , like random shower thoughts, deep life stuff, memes, or why cereal is technically soup. Chit chat online and meet only if you are not creep ☕ Grab coffee, drinks, or just hang out IRL if you’re nearby (bonus points if you know a good brunch spot).

ALSO… hear me out With so many people posting similar seeking out, I’m thinking of creating a little no-pressure friendship space kinda like those “Timeleft” social meetups, but free. You just pay for your own coffee/drinks, and the goal is simply to meet cool people and see where it goes. No networking. No weird vibes. Just humans being humans.

Would anyone be into that? 🤔 Drop your thoughts, ideas, or even your best dad joke in the comments. Let’s brainstorm and maybe build something fun together. Who knows this could be the start of some epic new friendships

Members will have to be socially exposed like introduction with genuine media verification to avoid or name and shame creeps 🥸

1nrdxp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1nrdxp8/the_sting_of_my_downfall_a_bipolar_story/,"The sting of my downfall, a Bipolar story","I’ve been thinking about it,

I am 21 in a downward spiral of debt from months worth of overspending on impulsive urges to build businesses/business plans some of which could literally save lives.

From there I fuelled back to back episodes of just smoking weed, energy drinks, coffees etc. I should’ve been doing cocaine if im being honest but I was consuming so much fucking caffeine and weed, gambling for a period.

This lasted for what would be a year in a few weeks, starting after I had returned home from a solo bicycle trip from Oshawa to Montreal, something I had been dreaming of doing for years as a sign of accomplishment to myself. The trip lasted 5 days leaving on Sunday and arriving in Montreal on Friday (560km).

The time allowed me to gain immense clarity of myself, as it was a challenge bearing through intense heat, camping, battling through rain and gravel (without water one day) as I forgot to fill it in a panic to hit the road. Luckily I DID find two kind strangers in Prince Edward county who scared shit out of me at first when they came out of nowhere while I was taking a break on trail. Luckily they gave me their water which I mixed with some gatorade and that got me through the day.

A few months prior to that I self admitted myself after I started spiralling from starting Zoloft, which I was prescribed a few months prior when I was depressed, this lead to months of me taking Zoloft and not realizing I was lowkey starting to tweak.

I was using occasional edibles during this time as I feel really really good, I mean my whole personality, mind etc felt like I was some destined millionaire (at the time I was working a lot of hours and stacking cash but I resorted to BNPL to extend my financial reach so to speak).

I hadnt been to school yet since I graduated highschool but during the time I was I was taking Zoloft I had a period in which I thought I was going to apply to ME engineering at University and decided to take online school to get credits for some courses I needed to apply (Some math, English, etc) so I applied.

I ended up never committing to the idea of school and instead focused my efforts into a more “artistic” side of me where I began to focus on art, drawing, pastel work, charcoal etc. I made content, Tiktoks, Instagram Reels etc for maybe a month or couple months. I aspired to start doing murals with graffiti, stencils for extra cash while doing social media to fuel revenue as some solo guy.

Then bam, I started just losing it, I mean I would literally get high in my room everyday. I started to not sleep (I was still working) and on the hour long bus rides home I would be so isolated and zoned out from everything around me, I just wanted to be home, drawing, learning creating.

I would come home and isolate in my room, I blocked out the sun using paper i think or garbage bags to create darkness in my room to tap into my something I dont even fucking know. And by then my sleep was already fucked, I mean I was sleeping a couple hours a night working 8 hour warehouse shifts then biking to nearby cities before returning before the morning to draw and for a few “quick nap” if that before I would head back to work.

Eventually I started to have some thoughts amidst a series of bans from several platforms and discord servers aswell as people suggesting to admit myself as I was in crisis. I then followed through with those suggestions and been advised by a doctor at the ER that I self admit myself, I mean I was going on about a bunch of random shit I dont even remember half of it.

I stayed for like 10 days I believe in the open unit which allows visitors, electronics and stuff while not having to be held in the closed units against your will. During the time I would be put on a bunch of meds and switched from the ones that weren’t helping me while allowing me time to be surrounded be some pretty nice people who I literally cant remember anything about other than that they who helped me find a good headspace.

I was discharged eventually and was able to not smoke, do mushrooms or ANYTHING that would cause me to end up in a bad spot. I started training and decided that I would bike to Montreal and so I trained, I don’t really remember what my goals were at the time but I was guided by this idea of a trip on a pink single speed of all things to give me hope.

Whelp, nothing fucking happened. I mean the trip happened but it didn’t feel how good it had felt in my mind and I knew I could do wayyy better, infact I was going to one up this the following summer 2025 and potentially go across Canada. But this time I had new challenges, smoking weed, caffeine, periods of spending too much wayyy to soon on ideas I has only just begun working on.

Weed sparked creativity inside me, motivation etc paired with the coffee and yeah it was pretty nice, lots of fucking ideas some shit others not so much. Paired with my constant swings into long periods of depression in which I actually quit weed, I began to experience the same delusions, existential dread but this time I couldn’t care enough to do anything so at times I resorted to self harm.

I had struggled to take my meds all throughout the process from the highs to lows. I began to abuse weed heavily from this point onward leading to a tank in my quality of life, poor financial decisions (im currently in thousands of dollars in debt) with nothing but the tip of the iceberg in resources id need to really make anything out of the stuff I bought.

I have ZERO money and ZERO way out.

Its just crazy think that I see this post asking why people don’t document there life with Bipolar, and I know others have found success in treatment and stability many others are lost in the cycle.

I fucking hate my life, im currently on medical leave and broke without any real feeling of hope. As someone with Bipolar who had once tried to build something for myself with self “sustained business ideas” and content creating has now pitted there own downfall. Its quite intense to imagine, the walls falling and eroding.",3,1758923141.0,BipolarReddit,2,1.0,False
1nrdwud,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadviceformen/comments/1nrdwud/why_would_a_woman_do_this/,Why would a woman do this?,"Last night I went to a social dance event. While I was sitting at the bar, a random girl came up to me and started talking. We hit it off really well — she was sweet, funny, and we connected easily. We ended up dancing together, got pretty close, broke the touch barrier, and it felt like we had a solid vibe.

Afterward, I got her Instagram, we chatted a bit longer, and before leaving I told her I had a lot of fun with her and that I’d like to see her again. I asked if she’d be down for coffee sometime and she said yes.

This morning I sent her a message: “Hey, I had a great time with you last night! I’d like to keep that energy going (: When can I see you again?” She’s seen it, but hasn’t replied.

I guess my question is — why would a woman approach me, start the conversation, give off that much interest, and even agree to coffee, but then just ghost when I follow up? Was it just for fun in the moment?

1nrdutf,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nrdutf/does_your_parent_keep_reminiscing_about_when_you/,Does your parent keep reminiscing about when you were a baby? (enmeshment rant),"My mom targets me for her enmeshment and I noticed she only nostalgic for me being a baby. She never talks about any of my brothers when they were babies, even my younger brother who's still a minor.

She outright ignores him, doesn't give him any attention at all. Yet acts obsessed with me. Follows me around, keeps probing when I don't want to talk, keeps buying me stuff I didn't ask for, telling me business I don't want to hear about.. And she keeps talking about me when I was a baby

Its like do you even give a shit about who I am now? Or who I was as a younger adolescent, teenager, younger adult? I'm almost in my mid twenties. i remember a stark difference from when I was actually a child and the youngest before my little brother was born. I was in his position 

I got zero attention. She was short, snappy, and impatient with me. Didn't spend time with me. And I remember her mocking me like she does to my little brother now. Which makes this 180 of coddling and obsession even more maddening.

I used to excuse this as it was genuinely a hard time for my family when I was younger. Divorce, poverty, my mom was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. As got older, I realized this was a smoke screen. She's just emotionally unavailable and immature, period. She's told me she's not in that mental state anymore 

Yet she still neglects my little brother. So it's an excuse. I find this behavior to be suffocating and now it's adding to my own depression. I was also highly annoyed to find out she was asking my older brother behind my back if he thinks I'm ready to work (she actively discourages me from working or keeps trying to insert herself in anything I do)

I'm 24, I get that I have a slew of mental problems and I struggle now but how else can I get better if I don't try? She acts like I'm completely helpless and can't do anything. 

She wouldn't let me open a bottle cap, wouldn't let me mop, told me ""oh you learned that by yourself?"" when I was using a coffee machine, and even went behind my back to ask my brother ""do you think she can do it?"" when it came to me putting together a pre assembled bike. 

Even my doctors appointments. She insists in going in with me even when I don't want her to (I haven't been to the doctors in over a year now so hadn't dealt with it recently). When I say I want to go in alone she asked ""are you embarrassed? It's okay to accept support"". I didn't need help each time.

 The first time I went to a dentist and the woman asking for my information looked confused and irritated when my mom was answering for me. I was about 18-19 years old. Her justification was that I was still in high school. That's just one example 

I feel like I'm going crazy sometimes. Especially when I feel guilty for avoiding her or being angry at her. Some people have noticed something was off and critisized her (although this was when I was a bit younger and didn't fully understand what was happening), but other times people make me feel like trash for how I feel and tell me I have no right to say or feel anyway because I'm still depdendent on her (even though she sabotaged me from working and I only got my paperwork that she lost replaced last year. She told me to focus on finishing high school and then I can work. 

And when I did, she didn't bother to find my paperwork for 3 years telling me ""I wasn't in a rush to find it because I feel like you can't handle working anyway""). Most people just don't understand this kind of abuse

Can you actually pull a good espresso in this machine comparable to what you could pull in a sage? I know you can just disable grind recommendation and also remove some washers on the conical burr to get finer grinding if needed but is everything else in the machine capable of producing a genuine quality espresso?

I used to be a barista and I appreciate good coffee. I'm not mad to the point where I would spend £2000 on a coffee machine but for the same price as this I could get a sage and I wonder if the sage would just give me a better coffee even if the grind settings were the same.  

TLDR im not a beginner. Will this machine limit me? Can I pull as good of an espresso with this as I could potentially do with a sage barista express etc?",1,1758922888.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,1,1.0,False

Also, this isn't comprehensive and definitely not a best of list. I don't have the income, time, or arteries to eat everywhere. I don't have the wealth of knowledge or credentials of local giants like Beth McKibben, Alton Brown, Henna Bakshi, Henri Hollis, Ligaya Figueras, etc..

I'm just a guy that likes what he likes.

Here's a few based callouts in the area:

**Duluth ( some x/post from some**[ **from**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gwinnett/comments/1nmeosk/comment/nftrsj6/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)[ **my**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gwinnett/comments/1nl61z0/comment/nftvdv4/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)[ **earlier**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gwinnett/comments/1nojjto/comment/nfshgz3/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)[ **comments**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gwinnett/comments/1nl61z0/comment/nftvdv4/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)**)**

[*Naju-Myunok*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/naju-myunok-duluth?osq=korean) \- Counter service Korean but done well and presented in a quite beautiful and most serene settings I have ever seen in the area. You can get a lot of value there without spending a ton.

[*Du Bu Gong Bang*](https://www.dubugongbang.co/) \- Maybe you have had soon dubu (korean tofu soup) or not. It doesn't matter because you probably haven't ever had it freshly made in house. I enjoy a good tofu but freshly made tofu hits such refreshing notes that meals here feel invigorating. The banchan is really well made and balanced in flavor. Do yourself a favor and get the add-on stone bowl rice with mushrooms to go with your soup combo. Toasty mushroom rice, piping hot tofu soup, and grilled meat or fish is the antithesis to the heavier all you can eat KBBQ fare littered all over the place.

[*Paik's Noodle*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/hong-kong-banjum-by-paiks-noodle-duluth?osq=Paik%27s+Noodle) \- Did you know that one of the judges from *Culinary Class Wars* on Netflix has a joint here? Korean-Chinese is not a style of cuisine that I eat with much regularity but I 100% know what I do like. Their sweet & sour pork (or chicken) has an impressive battered and fried shell that stays crispy through the sauce. The jajangmyeon (black bean noodle) is impressive. If you like seafood soups, the jjamppong has probably one of the cleanest shellfish broths I have ever tasted. Nice and spicy too!

[*Pelicana Chicken*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pelicana-chicken-duluth?osq=Pelicana+Chicken) *-* You are absolutely not going to save any money here. Forget it. You are only just going to get the best Korean fried chicken in the area (sorry to Choong-Man & BB.Q Chicken) and have them put cheese dust all over it. You will eat it and worry about the bill later.

[*Incha Duck Ink*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/incha-duck-ink-duluth?uid=irV0U7wOhAGtrc-pIj_n8g&utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)) \- A boba place that I wouldn't get boba from but the figurine selection is great if you're into anime. There is some surprising fun trying to perfect your painting skill of a small Pokémon/Studio Ghibli/Labubu/etc. figurine. 

[*Ozuri Izakaya*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ozuri-izakaya-duluth?uid=irV0U7wOhAGtrc-pIj_n8g&utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)) \- An Izakaya that's open till 4 AM except on Tuesdays. 100% solid fare. Great Japanese street style setting. KEEP INTERESTING LATE NIGHT DINING ALIVE

[*Teso Life*](https://www.tesolife.com/en/) \- Roaming the aisles filled with lots of reasonably priced Japanese goods is generally a fun window shopping kind of time with some definite deals to be had. Blind boxes & J-beauty galore. Snacks and easy meal kits a plenty.

[*Yezi Coconut*](https://www.yezicoconut.com/) \- Coconut desserts are having their moment in the sun in Duluth with the opening of this place. Amazing coconut water, very interesting fresh coconut pudding options but you're probably going to be in a line waiting till the hype dies down.

[*J-Mini Hot Pot*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/js-mini-hot-pot-duluth-2?uid=irV0U7wOhAGtrc-pIj_n8g&utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)) *-* An ol' reliable hot pot place personally for me. Share a hot pot with different broths with your friends and cook ingredients in there! For those who don’t know, it’s kinda like fondue but you make small bowls of noodle soup. It's communal and fun! Eat there before you go wait in line at Yezi!

[*Chicha-San-Chen*](https://www.chichasanchen.com/) *-* You've had boba/bubble tea already! But be prepared to be dazzled by the tea-presso machine! Seriously, there is a machine in there that pushes tea out like an espresso machine. It's worth checking out.

[*Gold Bunny Donut*](https://www.goldbunnydonut.com/) *-* These yeasty, fluffy, fried bundles of joy constantly rotate in selection. Definitely worth a visit.

[*Glaze Tea*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/glaze-tea-duluth-duluth-4) *-* Fresh toppings for milk tea (I still am a sucker for their taro tea, they have a “milk tea hot pot” which is repackages the milk tea concept from a single serving cup and straw to a sizable dry ice vaporizing “hot pot” and sharable dessert soup bowls, Glaze also sports a hand drawn menu. It's worth a trip.

[*Haru Ichiban*](https://www.haruichibanjapaneserestaurant.com/) *-* A classic old reliable Japanese restaurant. I still get 90’s vibes walking in there.

[*Captain Loui*](https://captloui.com/) \- I actually like their boil the most out of all the other ones in the area. They have a seafood menu that changes in pricing so be mindful of that if you like to order a la carte. I do enjoy that you can dump some garlic noodles directly on your table and use it to pick up some of your boil sauce.

[*Jusgo International Food Court*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/jusgo-international-food-court-duluth?adjust_creative=duckduckgo&utm_campaign=yelp_feed&utm_medium=feed_v2&utm_source=duckduckgo)  \- If you haven't walked through the right side set of doors past the big inflatable teddy bear at Jusgo in Duluth, you're missing out on the opportunity to eat a variety of food rather close proximity to each other including soup dumplings (XLB IYKYK) with a cozy broth and tender fillings and the beef brisket scallion pancake from[ *Lao Wei Dao*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/lao-wei-dao-%E8%80%81%E5%91%B3%E9%81%93-duluth?osq=Food+Court) or the eggplant at[ *Home Wok*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/home-wok-duluth?osq=home+wok).

[*Kampung Malaysian*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/kampung-malaysian-cuisine-duluth-2?osq=Kampung+Malaysian+Cuisine) makes a satisfyingly smoky made to order char kway teow that I had the pleasure to be an early customer of. I can also vouch for the dumplings and rendang. They also make comically large youtiao (chinese donuts) and frozen dumplings to go so check those out too.

Give yourself a digestion break and go into[ *Tokyo Kuma*](https://tokyokumausa.com/) and check out the different Japanese imported wares. Stationary fans will have fun there but I like to go to[ *Teso Life*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/teso-life-duluth?osq=Teso+Life) nearby instead since I think the pricing is better.

Luckily, there is[ *Fujiissa*](https://fujiissa.com/) nearby. Don't know about Fujiissa? It's the place that your Cafe Maiko loving friends all forgot existed as the far superior option.

Order any of the soft serve flavors there. No wrong answers here.

Their Hokkaido milk soft serve has no detectable flavor of milk powder.

Wanna know what crap or too much milk powder tastes like in ice cream? 

It's that overpowering dairy tang at the end of the body that just clings onto you and sometimes leaves a sour mouth like those overpriced fruit shaped ice creams that idiotic people resell on Facebook.

This soft serve has none of that, just a nice creamy finish.

If you like chestnuts and want something unique, order your soft serve with strands of chestnut paste (called montblanc) to cover your soft serve. It's a mashup of Japanese and French flavors that's worth trying at least once. Just order it in a cup (not in a cone, this thing is prone to falling) Just be mindful while eating to keep the topping from tumbling over to the floor.

On the way out, skip all of the fancy looking pastries and grab a loaf of Hokkaido milk bread at[ *Shokku Bakery*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/shokku-bakery-duluth?osq=Food+Court+japanese+bakery). It's super fluffy and perfect for sandwiches or as a toast. Just eat it fast or freeze it in two days.

[*678 KBBQ*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/678-korean-bbq-duluth?)*/*[*9292 KBBQ*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/9292-korean-bbq-duluth-3?)*/*[*K-BBQ Factory*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/k-bbq-factory-duluth?osq=K-BBQ+Factory) \- 3 reliable places for KBBQ. The difference? 678 & 9292 offer charcoal. K-BBQ Factory uses gas burners. All of these options offer all-you-can-eat (AYCE) but you can often order a combo for less that can easily feed 4 or more people that include things like noodle soup or fried rice for everyone at the end of a meal. Just don't forget the cheese corn.

[*Moo Bong Ri*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/moo-bong-ri-duluth-2?) *-* KBBQ that specializes in pork. A seriously good and underrated option.

[*Seoul Tofu House*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/seoul-tofu-house-duluth?) *-* A good old standby for Korean food. Nothing flashy but they do offer hot stone bowls during lunch. Their tofu soup is just classic to me.

[*7 Leaves Cafe*](https://7leavescafe.com/) *-* Their coffee and mung bean tea are the stars of the show for me.

[*Break Coffee Roasters*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/break-coffee-roasters-duluth-2?) *-* Say what you will about other coffee shops in the area but I find myself consistently going back to Break. I tend to favor coffee with fruitier notes and Break delivers in spades.

[*Cafe Blue*](https://jbmcusa.com/) *-* Premium in house roasted coffee that definitely asks for premium pricing. The flavor profile fits more of the classic coffee profile before that whole third wave stuff happened. Good matcha as well!

[*Sushi & Co.*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-and-co-duluth-2) \- This place is so unassuming from the outside but the inside is beautiful in a charming, eclectic way. The sushi here is stupid good with plating that could rival anything in the city. A hidden gem that’s a bit newer in the game.

[The couple that sells bungeo-ppang/taiyaki in Super H-Mart](https://www.yelp.com/biz/h-mart-duluth-duluth?) \- Walk into Hmart and immediately go to the left till you get up to the housewares section, take a right and while up while looking to your left. After the steamed rice cake section you’ll see a very small cozy booth with a nice older gentlemen or lady there. Order some freshly made red bean or chocolate fish shaped waffle cakes from them and just enjoy watching the process of making them. This experience is still enjoyable after maybe 20+ years.

[*Pleasant Garden BBQ*](https://www.pleasantgardenbbq.com/) \- Yall probably already are used to Chinese food. But what about Chinese BBQ? Not really about smoke and charcoal as much but the meat is still satisfying and it can be just as cozy. Never had the pleasures of Chinese BBQ? I suggest getting a 3 meat plate of crispy pork, honey bbq pork, and duck. The rest of the menu holds up here too so exploration will be rewarded.

[*Pho Dai Loi 3*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-dai-loi-3-duluth?) *-* I go to different places in the area for pho but I keep coming back here. Don't limit yourself only to pho over there either, ermkay?

[*Lemon Sweets Bakery*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/lemon-sweets-bakery-and-cafe-duluth?) *-* My biggest draw with them is that they make some unique looking single serving cakes and puddings! I am a personal fan of the purple rice taro pudding that they have.

[*Pocha Hanshin*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pocha-hanshin-duluth?) \- Pocha’s in Korea are generally categorized as unpretentious bar food. This place is near and dear to my heart because you can rent a room to do karaoke while eating well. I can’t really say the same for a lot of other karaoke joints.

[*Masterpiece*](https://www.masterpieceduluth.com/rs/index_home.action?pageType=D) \- No frills Szechuan that still does it right after all this time. 

[*Wowbooza*](https://wowbooza.com/) \- Wowbooza sells a Middle Eastern style of ice cream called booza which is characterized with its more melt resistant qualities as well as for its pleasing chewy texture. Look past all of the Dubai chocolate hype and go get their crispy rose syrup laced cheesy bottomed kunefe with a scoop of your booza of choice. Giggle between bites and talk about how everyone else with a dubai chocolate anything in their hands is missing out. Also, the karak tea and Turkish coffee are legit.

**Lawrenceville**

[*Village Burger - Lawrenceville*](https://villageburger.com/) **-** Counter service w/ classic burgers, fries/onion rings, shakes. Decent value for the money.

[*NY Prime Chicken*](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ny-prime-fried-chicken-lawrenceville) \- Hole in the wall but HOLY FUCK is the chicken good! The breading is substantial without being really heavy (looking at you Zaxby's) and this chicken is seasoned through. The sides are okay to good but the Indian options are a hidden gem. Great value for the money.

[*Mixteca Tamales*](https://mixtecatamales.com/) \- Solid tamales but I do enjoy the whole menu. Tucked near a gas station.

I've been having this frustrating issue with my coffee grinder lately, and I thought I'd share my experience and solutions since I know many of you might face similar problems.

So, my trusty coffee grinder suddenly stopped working last week. After doing tons of research and talking to other coffee enthusiasts, I discovered several common reasons why coffee grinders fail to start, and I'll share everything I learned.

First, check if it's properly plugged in (I know, sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how often this is the issue). If that's not it, look for any visible damage to the power cord. My old grinder had a frayed cord that needed replacing.

The next thing to check is the safety switch. Most modern coffee grinders won't start unless the lid is perfectly aligned. Sometimes, coffee grounds can get stuck in the lid mechanism, preventing proper contact. A quick cleaning usually fixes this.

Speaking of cleaning, this is crucial! Coffee oils and fine grounds can build up over time, causing the motor to strain or completely stop working. I learned this the hard way. Regular maintenance is key to keeping your grinder running smoothly.

If you've tried these solutions and your grinder still won't start, it might be time for a replacement. After my old one died, I did extensive research and found an amazing grinder that's been working perfectly for months now. You can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder

Another common issue is a burned-out motor. If your grinder makes a humming sound but won't spin, or if it's been overworked, the motor might be shot. This happened to my first grinder when I tried grinding too many beans at once.

Here's what I do now to prevent grinder issues:
- Clean it after every few uses
- Don't overload it with beans
- Let it cool down between grinds
- Keep it away from moisture
- Check the cord regularly

If you're in the market for a new grinder (like I was), I highly recommend checking out this model: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder. It's been super reliable and has some great safety features that prevent most common issues.

Remember, a good coffee grinder is an investment in your daily coffee experience. Don't wait until your current one completely dies before considering an upgrade. Regular maintenance and proper use will extend its life, but sometimes replacement is the best solution.

Hope this helps! Let me know in the comments if you've experienced similar issues or have other tips to share!",1,1758922675.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

For those having various results with extraction, keep in mind that grind size is not the only factor to look into. 

Brew temperature is equally important. 

In general Breville ships machines calibrated to 200’F which should work well for most beans. If by any means your coffee is either too bitter or too sour despite proper extraction times can try and play with temp a little:

- for light, medium light and medium roast : 205’F
to reduce sourness and bring out some sweetness
- for dark roast: 195’F

1nrdnj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SavannahBikeTours/comments/1nrdnj4/trolley_or_two_wheels_why_a_savannah_bike_tour_is/,Trolley or Two Wheels? Why a Savannah Bike Tour is the BEST Way to See the City,"​You've arrived in Savannah, the Hostess City. Now comes the big decision: how are you going to see all those beautiful squares, magnificent mansions, and hidden gardens?

​For many, the default is the classic trolley. It's easy, you're off your feet, and it covers a lot of ground. But ""easy"" isn't always ""best."" If you want to truly feel the city's charm, breathe the Spanish moss air, and get an authentic, local perspective, you need to ditch the giant shuttle and hop on a bike.

​Here are the four biggest reasons a Savannah Bike Tour is the superior way to experience our historic city.

​

**1. You Get Up-Close and Personal (The Trolley Just Waves Hello)**

​When you're rolling in a big trolley, you're essentially viewing Savannah through a window. The tour moves along busy main roads, often skirting the edges of the historic squares.

​On a bike tour, you get to stop inside the squares, dismount, and walk a few steps to admire the intricate architecture, touch the centuries-old brickwork, and stand beneath the massive, moss-draped oak trees.

​The Difference:

​Trolley: You see the sights from a distance as you pass by.

​Bike Tour: You are immersed in the sights, able to pause for the perfect, uninterrupted photo, and explore the details the trolley can't reach.



**​2. Uncover the Hidden and Quiet Corners**

​Trolleys are limited to public roads and thoroughfares. If the pavement is too narrow or the street is residential, they have to drive right on past.

​Savannah’s best-kept secrets—the quiet, residential streets, the hidden courtyard entrances, the most charming Victorian alleyways—are the ones that buses can’t fit down. Our bike routes are deliberately designed to glide through these lesser-worn paths, giving you a deeper, more authentic view of Savannah’s local life that most tourists never see.

​

**3. It's a Healthy Adventure (Not Just a Ride)**

​Let's face it: after a day of Southern dining, a little activity feels great! Savannah's historic district is flat, making it the perfect place for an easy, leisurely ride. You'll cover more ground than you could on a walking tour, but you’ll do it actively, enjoying the fresh air and a cooling breeze.

​For those who want less effort, we offer e-bikes, letting you fly up the occasional small incline without breaking a sweat. It’s a great way to sightsee without feeling cooped up, crowded, or passive.

​The Difference:

​Trolley: Passive, noisy, and potentially stuffy or crowded.

​Bike Tour: Active, quiet, and refreshing, connecting you directly to the environment.

​

**4. You Get a Rolling Concierge, Not a Scripted Narration**

​Trolley guides have to follow a script designed for hundreds of passengers over a multi-stop loop. That often means focusing only on major landmarks and keeping to a tight schedule.

​Our bike tours feature small group sizes and engaging, local guides. This allows for a much more personal experience. You can ask more questions, get spontaneous recommendations, and chat about local life.

​Your guide will finish the tour by acting as your ""rolling concierge,"" pointing out the best hidden brunch spots, the locals' favorite coffee shop, and the least touristy bar, ensuring you are set up for a fantastic rest of your trip.

​

​**The Bottom Line:** Choose Experience Over Convenience

​The Old Town Trolley is a decent option if you want a quick, surface-level overview. But if you want to immerse yourself in Savannah's charm, glide down the quietest streets, get an intimate view of the history, and leave with insider tips only a local knows, the choice is clear.

Okey Okey... I am trying to make this quick and simple:

I (f22) met a guy at my workplace. And I immediately felt that he was interested in me. Female intuition or something. He only worked there for a month or so to help out and we only had some very brief small talk, maybe 3 sentences or so a day. In passing I asked him if he would like a goodbye cake and he seemed rather surprised and agreed. So I baked a cake (for the entire work place to be fair) and he seemed rather surprised by the idea that I actually made one and that it tastes good. He slipped me a piece of paper with his number under the cake pan (which I saw later on) and then also handed me one as we saw each other in passing as I was leaving. He said he would like to give something in return for the cake, maybe a coffee. (guess a way to a man's heart is truly through the stomach) Stupid, overwhelmed and inexperienced me went ""ohhh, are you asking me on a date?"" to which he said maybe, if it's a yes. He said I should think about it.

So. Now I am confused. Because like... The idea that anyone is interested in me is unfathomable to me. I also am entirely inexperienced with dating and scared shitless of the dating culture. For me romance is something... Heavy. Something serious and meaningful. I'm set on the idea of having a soulmate and thinking about going on a date with someone feels almost like cheating... I am not sure if I even like the guy. He seems decent but I fear I just bask in the attention and in the idea of romance, of the possibility.

Am I prude? Has anyone any advice or just kind words because I am clueless. Gladly from both male and female perspective (or in between)

1nrdjz9,https://i.redd.it/ix9vllxzokrf1.png,🌱 Potentially useful app for us!,"Hey r/gardening

I wanted to throw an idea out there and see what you all think.

Keeping track of a garden can feel overwhelming sometimes- planting dates, watering, thinning, harvesting. And if you’re new, it’s even worse:

* “I did something different with this plant and it worked but I forgot what I did...""
* “Is that bug bad?”
* “Why are my leaves yellow?”
* “When did I water that last?”

Juggling calendars, phone notes, buggy and ad-filled apps, and late-night Googling just to keep up can be crazy.

So I started sketching out a super simple, privacy-first gardening app called **Pot** (lmao).

# The core idea

* Track what you planted and when with optional pictures of each plant and get a little log for each sprout to keep track of what you do.
* Get gentle reminders based on average growth rates: when to water, thin, or harvest.
* Quick reference photos of healthy plants so you can cross-check yours.
* How to do the things: thinning, appropriate water amounts, how to set up a garden cheaply, when to plant, how to plant, germinating, how to compost, how to protect plants from pests.
* Encouragement built in- a little buddy that smiles and is happy when you finish a task, gamify your gardening without doing anything and without locking you in annoying animations. Simply hit a ""done"" button on tasks you were gonna do anyways and watch him do a little dance at the bottom of the screen. (helps me as someone with rampant ADHD).
* Accessibility features so older gardeners and absolute beginners can use it easily.
* Optional weather alerts (frost/heat warnings) based on your approximate area — no GPS tracking, ever.
* Optional community map: drop a photo of your harvest or garden in your area, comment on others, and share the fun- without pin-pointing your exact location.
* Completely open-source, so you can be sure I'm not crypto-mining in the background.

# Sustainable Development

* Pot will always be free and fully functional.
* No accounts. No tracking. No forced ads. Your data stays on your device. It can even be used offline.
* If you want to support, there’ll be:
   * A tiny “Watch Ad” button on the homepage. With what will hopefully be a personalized thank you splash text after you watch one.
   * A link to a Patreon or other service in settings. ""Buy the dev a coffee"" type deal.
* Nothing is paywalled. Dark mode, themes, plant icons, different little buddies to make happy, all free. Hopefully some app icons made by supporters in the future! Maybe an out-of-the-way progression system that earns you points to buy your buddy cool hats. (no purchasable currency)

""We wont harvest your data, only your plants.""

I’d love feedback:

* Would you use an app like this?
* What’s the one feature that would actually help your gardening routine?
* Do you think its a rad idea?

Women have so many different preferences. Not every girl is into makeup, skincare or fancy perfume and even if she is there are too many options (shade, skin type, brand).

So instead of stressing over picking the perfect serum or lipstick... think bigger picture! BUY SOMETHING SHE CAN ACTUALLY USE IN HER DAILY LIFE!!! It doesn't have to be beauty related just something thoughtful, useful and maybe a little fun.

Here's a safe list that works for most

* **Self-care stuff** – bath bombs, spa kit, candles, cozy robe.
* **Simple jewelry** – small hoops, dainty necklace, something with her initial.
* **Neutral tote/handbag** – something she can grab daily.
* **Coffee/tea gear** – aesthetic mug, milk frother, mini espresso maker.
* **Subscription box** – skincare, wine, books, snacks (fun surprise every month).
* **Experience gifts** – spa day, concert tickets, weekend trip, cooking class.
* **DIY kits** – candle-making, paint-by-numbers, pottery kit.
* **WFH upgrades** – cozy throw, cute desk organizer, wireless keyboard.
* **Personalized gifts** – engraved bracelet, photo book, custom star map.

Bottom line: it's less about price... more about showing you thought about her. Every woman's taste is different so pay attention to what she uses or mentions and pick something that fits her vibe.

And honestly it doesn't even have to be big or expensive. Even something as small as her fav snack, a drink she loves or a tiny item that shows you notice the little things about her that's what makes it special. If it's thoughtful and shows you care she'll appreciate it. ❤️✨",1,1758922029.0,u_Personal-Weekend3173,0,1.0,False

Tips for dining hall life and staying in a deficit,"I’ve struggled with binge eating before, and recently it came back hard after a few stressful nights. I binged three to four times this week, and when it happens, it doesn’t just ruin the binge itself—it ruins the whole day, sometimes the whole week. Once I binge, the rest of the day becomes an ordeal of eating way past fullness and then trying to “make up for it” with extra working out. The most frustrating part is that when I’m consistent, I actually make progress in the gym, but these binges set me back every time. It feels like the one thing holding me back in life right now.

The last time I broke out of this cycle, I went sugar-free for about a week. That reset my cravings and finally quieted down the food noise. I want to try that again, because at this point I’m willing to do whatever it takes to stop.

The problem is I’ve replaced sugar with artificial sweeteners. I chew gum constantly—sometimes every half hour like it’s a ritual. I drink diet soda all the time. I’ve even eaten straight sweetener out of the bag, sometimes mixed with unsweetened cacao powder, sometimes not. It feels like I’m hooked on sweetness itself, no matter the source. And even though I’ve been eating in a calorie deficit, all the artificial sweeteners are making me feel bloated and just plain awful most of the time.

I also eat out of boredom, even when I’m not hungry, which I know is another thing I need to stop but I don’t know how. And once a craving kicks in, I’ll literally walk a mile to the gas station to binge. When that urge starts, I can’t seem to interrupt it.

Right now I mostly eat in the dining hall since I don’t have much store access. That might actually make this a good time to try a full reset, since I can’t keep buying sweets or “healthy” snacks. But the menus online aren’t always accurate (like a bagel listed as “zero sugar,” which obviously isn’t true), so I’m not sure what to trust.

I’m ready to throw away every sweet thing in my dorm if I have to. If removing them helps reduce the food noise and cravings, I’ll do it.

A few questions I’d really appreciate advice on:

1. I’ve been using Alani energy drink packets in the mornings for caffeine and appetite control. Should I cut those too since they’re sweet, and switch to black coffee?
2. Do I need to give up diet soda completely to make a reset work?
3. For dining halls, what are your go-to sugar-free, protein-friendly options?
4. How do you navigate sauces, dressings, or baked items when the ingredient list seems wrong?
5. How long does a reset usually take before cravings quiet down?
6. How do you get through the first few days when the food noise and cravings are loud enough to distract you from class?
7. For people who’ve been through this: did throwing out all sweets actually help long term, or just short term?

I really want to do this in a way that’s realistic as a student, keeps me in a calorie deficit, and helps me finally get rid of these binges.",2,1758922003.0,sugarfree,1,1.0,False

I was born and lived in Wales for the first 3 years of my life, but moved to Georgia 3 days after my 3rd birthday. This meant that until roundabout the age of 20, I had an atrocious mutated accent that blended Welsh and Georgia Southern. I ordered eggs and a piece of roast at the diner, but the waitress misunderstood me and served me the much superior breakfast instead. Eggs, coffee, toast.



After eating, I washed my dishes and sat on the couch to watch my daily morning 4 episodes of Golden Girls- I once smashed the family TV when I was 8 because the DVR only recorded 3- when my phone rang. I refused to answer it. The episode's credits were rolling but the outro song hadn’t ended yet. It rang again and died off. It rang once more but this time I picked it up as the screen went black. 



“Hello?”



“Charlie?”



“Yes.” I said blankly as I fiddled with a strand of hair.



“We’ve picked up a case: Oats Valley, Rhode Island. Get to the tarmac, we’re flying out at 6.” Zadok’s charming voice cooed over the phone.



“On my way.” I hurried to my closet and unracked and packed my 7 sets of my outfit- white button up, black tie, white T-shirt, cargo pants, and my green chucks- into my duffel bag. Despite my routine being “Algorithmic,” as it's been called, I put the bare minimum into my effort when getting dressed; I rarely bother tying my shoes, but I button my shirt and- loosely- tie my tie each time.



My bike revved and as the engine warmed I stuffed the duffel bag into the saddlebag. My house is small, my clothes are bought in bulk, but my bike was where I spent big. My Confederate FA-13-  engraved along the side read: In love, my father- was admittedly a big spend, but I don’t spend money often. My house was given to me by work, my food; besides breakfast; was paid for by work, and my uniform; beside my shoes; were once more paid for by work. 145 horsepower carried me wistfully to the Organization's private runway. 



\*\*\*



“What’s he waiting for?” A snub-nosed, Shar Pei man guffed.



“It’s 5:58. We told him we’re leaving at 6, so… he’s waiting for 6.” 



“He does this often?”



“Every time, about 9 years ago we were tired of making late flights so we just told him to get here 15 minutes before we actually took off.”



“Seems like a burden.” 



“He’s a slave to routine- besides: Man’s a brainiac.” Zadok always dressed with enthusiastic pomp. He believes a genius detective should wear an equally genius suit. While I disagree with the principle, I can’t deny a good suit when I see it. This one was dim maroon and his personal favorite in size and breast.



“Who’s this?” I asked as I stepped through the men on to the plane and seated my bag.



“Oats Valley, Rhode Island Sheriff, Isaiah Bradford.” My nose bristled against the stink of habitually conjured smoke, soaked into the man’s existence. His left leg bowed faintly and that side’s foot was flippant and untamed.



“Your inserts are too big.” I thought aloud; grabbing a donut from the box of 12. “Give me your lighter.”



“I don’t- what?”



“Lighter.”



“Why? And wait, how dare yo-”



“Give me the lighter.” He turned to Zadok who ignored his gaze, alerting the pilots to raise the stairs. Baffled to silence, he scoffed and passed me his lighter. Moonlight infested the plane's cavity as I awoke each half-lidded window of the plane. 



I bit into my donut, resting my head onto my bag, and slid gently into my headphones. The plane; harboring a humming Bowie fan, a sheriff of a town in a state I had no care to respect, and well-suited reader, jaunted into the air with infractionless obedience of Bernoulli's.



Across the pitch, a laminated box was fussed with followed by the stiff rifling of pockets crescendoing into a defeated sigh and the replacement of the box into a pocket. I weakly itched my nose and drifted off to sleep.



May it be intuition, or surgical routine but an hour before landing I sat up awake. “Why did you contact us?”



“No good morning? No who’d ya sleep?” The withdrawn Sheriff asked.



“No sir, I believe he asked you why you called us?” Zadok answered, saving me from having to repeat myself.



After much pause: “It wasn’t my idea. One of my deputies told me about an organization, some fancy thing where genius PI’s take cases deemed impossible. He told me it’s strictly lock and key, only police stations and departments have access to your contact. He told me to call you, because the serial killer Mr. 7-Days is due to start his annual killing spree.”



“Dumb name- Annual?” I asked as I cleaned my glasses.



“Every year- from February 11th to the 17th- he kills someone each day: Sunday by fire. Monday by water, Tuesday by- usually- a gun, Wednesday by asphyxia, Thursday by poison, Friday by stabbing with shards of a mirror, and Saturday by Scythe. Every year, for the past 3 years. That guy leaves no trace, no gloats or notes, just the bodies.”



“He leaves a trace, you just don’t see it. His vehicles for homicide are quite specific. Any significance to you?” I asked.



“No.”



“I assumed.” I turned to Zadok and with a look he pointed to the French press.



“So why fly out and not just settle with calling us?” The press jeered below my palm.



“Frankly speaking: The less time I spend as a possible victim the better.”



“So you swore to serve and protect but are a coward as well?” I asked without the slightest trace of intended disrespect, it was a genuine question.



“Listen kid, I’m old enough to be your father, and you’re damned lucky I ain’t ‘cause with that mouth I'd be liable to slap you silly.”



“Everyone just relax, okay?”



“Put a leash on him. Don’t care how damn smart he is, I won't take disrespect.”



“He didn’t answer my question.” I grumbled but had the awareness to do so under my breath so he wouldn’t hear.



The vessel came to an enthusiastic stop, letting open its jowls to make way for us to disembark. A seldom-spaced can taxied us from the landing strip to the Oats Valley Police Station. The carbon slate box coward from study breezes, stiffly between two other stubby buildings. I exited first from the car but lagged behind to let Isaiah touch the door and open it. Greeting me inside were 3 desks and 2 deputies. “That big is Hunter, and the other is Axel.”



“Nice to meet you, gentlemen. My name is Zadok, Zay if it’s more comfortable, and that: Is Agent Charlie Gnosis.” Zadok shook their hands for me as I took in the breath of the room, a third of which housed Deputy Hunter. Axel was a junior by a factor of 3 from the Sheriff and was as fiddly and anxious as comes with youth, most assuredly exacerbated by his strenuous employment, and looked at me with some awe.



Zadok began his usual procedure of befriendment as I stalked around the office working harder than I should have to to avoid tripping on the spilt Hunter. In a small nook on Axel’s side was a miniature library of encyclopedias of rubber varieties, Norse myth, and legal jargon, as well as the sparse fiction. The bulk of the fiction texts were stored on the bottom shelf labeled in ownership to Sheriff Isaiah, above was an almost empty shelf aside from cobwebs and two cook books deeded to Hunter, Axel’s shelf was where the real books were stored and reading the titles tempted me to remove my library card from my wallet and ask what the checkout limit is. “We will need all files and related media to Mr. 7-Days and the victims, and a recommendation for the cleanest hotel in this town.”



“That’d be the Marrion out by the ports, they got the fancy beds.” Axel lisped.



“Marriot?” 



“Marrion, legally distinct.”



Zadok hurled me a look, but I replied with a shivering nod of acceptance. “Perfect. Gentlemen, it's been lovely meeting you, a real pleasure.” He shook their hands twice each, “But I’m afraid we’ve had a long flight and are as exhausted as they make ‘em.” Isaiah nodded in agreement as he sanded his weary eyes. 



“We’ll be back in the morning. I expect everyone to be well rested and sober.” Everyone laughed; Zadok laughed in community not humor with the laughter around him, knowing I hadn’t intended for what I said to be funny.



\*\*\*



“None of this makes sense.” Zadok sounded from the small corner desk as I clogged the room with the stench of artificial lemon. “7 days, 7 deaths, 7 completely unrelated devices of homicide. Once a week? Every year for the past 3? And not a trace to be gleaned.""



“All related.” I corrected.



“What?” He turned in his chair as I flicked off the bathroom light and tracked me as I disrobed my hands of the vinyl gloves and reclothed them with another pair that would serve as more permanent attire now that the space was clean enough. A small tide of vomit tickled the back of my throat as I touched the damp box of the gloves- moistened by disinfectant- but pushed through as I usually do to retrieve my protectors.



“Each method is the exact same each year, even the beach the people are drowned on and the rope used to bind them is the same.”



“And that relates them how?”



“Reason for yourself: You are a crippling narcissist who had planned- because this is most surely planned- a string of prefect murders from the 11th to 17th of February. You commit 7 perfect crimes in a row and get off, never so much as suspected.”



“Okay…?”



“You kill these people for a reason, a reason you find very intelligent and spectacular but none of the dim wits in this town actually get why you did what you did. They call you a crazed mass murder and give you no merits for your genius murders. Read those transcripts; they never even mention that you left no trace. They don’t boast of how perfect your crimes were- on top of not understanding why you did what you did in the first place.”  
  


“So you do it again.”



“Exactly.”



“Some one doesn’t get a joke so you say it again but louder.”



“Exactly. He’s not killing again because he wants to, but because he has to: He has to have people relish his genius.”



“He needs praise…” Zadok bubbled. “Dim-wits?” He questioned. “They’re not that bad. We’ve most certainly seen worse.”



“Why do you think he chose February?""



“Shortest month of the year?”



“Don’t give me the moronic answer, give me the dim answer.”



“Roman festival celebrating rebirth. Februa which is what February is named after.”



“Much better.” I tossed open my duffel bag and removed my sleeping bag, proceeding to begin disinfecting it.



“Right, but that’s not the dim answer; that’s the: I accidentally took too many etymology classes in college answer.” 



I turned sharply to Zadok and gestured at him with my sloshing spray bottle. “It was no accident.” He chuckled and turned back to the files.



“Either way; still doesn’t explain how these 7 days are related.”



“It's simple: in… in- uh… do you smell that?” Zadok’s nose twitched to attempt to capture the odor I was tracing.



“No-” I muted him with a gloved hand over his mouth. 



“Ozone.” I tapped my extended index finger to my lips and pulled my service weapon off my hip. Zadok left the chair with silent grace, pulling his revolver off the nightstand. I removed my phone and aimed the camera down the peephole. I pressed my body against the wall and leaned to examine the camera’s view; Zadok reached the corner of the hall leading into the room and stored a breath. 



My ear established contact with my shoulder and in the window of the camera stood an opaque silhouette. \*Pop\* \*Pop\* \*Pop\* Three stapler shots clicked off and an accompanying three messy holes appeared, flying into where my gut would have stood. The phone squealed as it clattered to the ground, whining more when the door stuck its eyes and hurled into the wall that was soon dented by the door handle. I flew into the hall and cracked off 8 .45 ACP down the hall, only stopping when the slide of the 1911 locked back- hungry for more rounds. The figure scrambled down the hall wheezing and giggling after feeling a bullet fly through his hoodie and draw a line along their scalp, barely off enough to not break skin.



“Fuck!” The maw of Zadok’s revolver leveled down the hall but remained meek as the figure dashed into the stairwell.



“Run him down-” Zadok was half-way down the hall. I slid back into the room, dragged my palms through the residual disinfectant on the sleeping bag, and threw open the window to the fire escape; stumbling on 3 small black spheres tossed around the carpet in the process. I scaled a level down, aimed, and landed shoulder first into the roof of the only car I didn’t recognize from my last look out the room window. I hacked and sniffed as I rolled off to the side walk and reset my shoulder against the door of the Honda. Zadok barked from around the side of Marrion’s and from the alley, the figure ran out into my shoulder.



The figure rammed his elbow into my ribs, working his right arm out of my grip and emptying his magazine down the alley; a bullet glanced across Zadok’s cheek, beating the odds of hitting him as he tossed himself behind a dumpster. My gloved hand shot out and fiddled against his throat trying to find the top of the sternum; I divined it and drove my thumb into his windpipe.



The figure balked like a tormented chicken and flailed against me harder, colliding his forehead against my nose. My nostrils flared and the bones cackled then gurgled through the blood. The figure gave a final thrash and escaped my grip, into their car, blazing off down the street, and rounding the corner before Zadok got to my side.



“Shit! Shit!” He shouted, tucking his arms under me and waddling with me over the back seat of the rental. I wept inaudible cries of disgust.



“Ethss airrrr-” I gagged on my blood and disgust. The bullet I fired ripped open the man’s balaklava, making way for his sweat soaked hairs to rub against my face. I stiffed my cries as much as I could muster, trying to not inflame Zadok’s already exorbitant stress with annoyance with my babyish behavior. The hybrid engine of the Prius roared- purred- and the tires yelped.



I wiggled forward, struggling against agony to wash my face in my blood in the vain hope the sparse white blood cells would exterminate any bacteria. My placid limp face was surreally red when, finally, the car rocked to a screaming stop.



\*\*\*



“Well, Mr. Smith, he’ll be able to breathe, but he won’t be able to take another tumble like that. This splint needs to set for a couple of weeks minimum.” Zadok stood beside me as the doctor impressed upon me how fragile the 13 fragments my nose had been factored to, currently were.



“Thank you, doctor.” Zadok shook the prim doctor’s hand.



“Never thought private nursing was so dangerous.” The doctor joked.



“Hauling around 50 pound oxygen tanks isn’t necessarily safe, I’ve had my fair share of spills.” Zadok’s ruckus laugh clattered about the room in a skipping dance.



After some more banter, the doctor took leave to input a Mr. James’s- my- files into the hospital's system. “Nurses?”



“I had to think of something.”



“I’m not complaining, it’s just a new one; usually it’s: Boxer and his coach, or home renovators.” 



“Gotta be open to new things, bud.” He smirked and I smiled back, shifting my head slightly only for it to flare with aching pain. Zadok flinched at my stifled pain. “How bad is it?”



“Remember, Mr. Cruel?”



“Yeah.”



“About there.”



“Fucking hell… At least neither of us got shot.” He shrugged.  
  


“I’d prefer that.” Zadok laughed again but stopped as he met my slitted eyes. “Rubber bullets; had enough power to go through the door but they bounced off the window, almost tripped on one on my way out.”



“He was trying to scare us off?”



“No, far as he sees it, we’re the only people who can understand his motive. He was goading us.” Zadok chewed methodically on his lip. “And…” I gave the clock a moment more to finish counting. “Now it’s the 11th.”

1nrdewd,https://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/1nrdewd/is_my_range_when_i_sing_with_my_straw_indicative/,Is my range when I sing with my straw indicative of what my actual range could be?,"I’ve been learning to sing properly these past few months. I use a slightly larger coffee stirrer to sing into (like, not the super stick skinny ones but smaller than a standard straw), and always have my hand cupped against my ear along with watching myself in a mirror to ensure I’m actually singing and not humming. 

With my straw, I feel I can take on almost anything. I can sing the low notes in Josh Turner’s “Your Man” (though I have to use my fake man heavy chest voice to do it) and hit the super high note in “Golden”, the viral song from K-Pop Demon hunters. I believe I’ve gathered that the Josh Turner low note is a G2 and the golden high note is an A5 but I may be mistaken. Again I cup my ears to make 100% sure I’m not humming. I know they’re not entirely reliable, but my pitch analyzer app reads around those areas when I do my straw singing so I want to say I’m not entirely fooling myself. And when I record, my straw singing blends perfectly with the original artists. 

But I can’t get to either of these notes without a straw. The best I can get with my highs strawless is F5, and as far as my lows I don’t even think I’m hitting anything that ends with a 2.

Is the straw giving me a false sense of what my range is, like helping me hit notes that I actually can’t hit when I go without it? G2 to A5 would be a decent range for a self taught beginner singer so I have a lot of doubts.

This is rather major, a national company buying a landmark local location and turning around and closing it in a handsweep move just a couple decades later. 

Indeed, what is going to happen to the kettle? If another coffee place doesn't move into the location and the kettle is taken down after a century, where does it go? There should at least be an article about it.

I'll quickly explain the context.

About a month ago I broke up with my ex, we lived together and we had several things in the house. Some bought together and some things she had brought from her house. 

We parted on good terms. We both agreed, but let's say she made a clear decision with no room to argue, so I would feel more like the one who was left. I was quite ill the first two weeks, now little by little I'm better and in any case I wouldn't be interested in going back. I just feel a little resentful about some of his attitudes, but it will pass. 

In December I will leave the house where we were together (she has already returned to her parents). When she left she left some of her things and she told me I could leave them there in the house for the next tenants (some cups, glasses etc.). However, he also left me some nice things like some pans, a coffee machine and a pillow. I honestly told her to take everything that was hers, but she didn't take those things the last time she came home (I wasn't there). 

Anyway closure without too much drama etc.. Since she left I have never written to her. We only spoke for a week for reasons related to the house we were renting. I will have to hear from you in about a month because the last bills concerning you will arrive and you will have to send me your share. On this occasion I thought I'd tell her about those objects (pans, coffee machine and pillow) that I won't take away and if she's interested I'll arrange them for her and she'll pick them up (she still has the keys). 

I want to give them back to him because I don't want anything that isn't mine. If they were things of little importance or old I would have left them there, but since they are things of a little more value I wanted to ask you if you want them back. 
However, I don't want to seem resentful, I am a bit but honestly I don't want to give him the impression of still feeling emotions about things that concern him. 

Do you think I should ask him? Or do I leave everything in the old house?
 Honestly, it seems like a waste or a lack of respect to me (even if I never asked him, he left them for me as a ""favor""). But at the same time I don't want to give the impression that I hold a grudge against her and her things.

1) Stopped snacking at night time. Absolutely nothing to eat after 7pm. 

2) Started focusing on eating more fiber and protein.

3) Have my 1 splurge daily which is coffee with plenty of creamer. My creamer has a ton of calories and it's the only splurge item that I can't give up.

3) Keep myself busy, I am a stress eater, bored eater, so
when I start to think about snacking I keep myself busy whether that means cleaning, going for a walk, bike ride, and just walk away from the kitchen. 

4) I set ""small"" goals, next one is another 20 pounds, then another 20 after that.  I should be at ""normal"" bmi after that.
 
5) Looking at and counting calories really does help. I was shocked to see how much I would eat before CICO, especially with my snacking right before bedtime.  Little snacks I thought were healthy were packed with as much calories as a meal. Looking at labels has given me a new insight on how to manage what I eat. 

6) Did not starve myself, I ate good healthy food, lots of protein (chicken and shrimp are my favorite), lots of fiber (yogurt, chia seeds in smoothies, whole grain bread, veggies), and no soda or juice, just water.  

Hope this helps anyone who is struggling. If I can do it you can as well.  I'll provide hopefully another positive update in the future.

1nrd7ry,https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/1nrd7ry/the_friend_i_always_wished_for/,The friend I always wished for,"I remember being a young kid, then a young teen and through high school and adulthood, always wishing for a best friend. I was always the friend on the side, everyone around me had a better or closer friend. I remember the girl I believed was my best friend introducing me to her best friend... 
I'm grateful I had friends and we would do fun stuff together but I always felt lonely. 

Anyway, fast forward to the year I turned 27 with my kid in a new school, newly living in a small town and not really knowing anyone there. I had lost a baby just after he was born that March, I was obviously devastated and holding it together for my older son. My husband did his best, but we had just lost my father in law the previous year and it was just a few months from then, he didn't even get to process that yet. We were kind of floating through life, sad and frustrated but smiling for our kid. 

So there's this other mum and we'd always be at drop off around the same time and walking our kids to class. One day my son said he wanted to invite her kid over to play, so I found her phone number on the parents group and sent her a text because I'd kept forgetting to ask at school. She said sure, we can plan for the new term since she was a bit busy. The next term came around and she made sure we arranged an afternoon for our boys to come over to my house since I lived nearby and she was in the next town over. She came too and it was the first time I'd really had a chance to sit with another mum and chat and just be myself for an hour, in a long time. We found we had so much in common, including growing up in the same neighborhoods. She and her family became a fixture in our lives since then. I don't think I could be more grateful. I started to laugh again and didn't have to force a smile or force some mundane conversation. I was genuinely happy. She didn't judge me, she laughed at my jokes and listened to me and accepted me wholeheartedly. We could be genuinely curious about each others religions and cultures and careers and it became something we really bond over, since despite how different we should be, we share the a lot of the same values and world views. Somehow a year and a half later, I've had her kid over countless afternoons, we shared school pick ups, went out for coffee so many times, visited each other in the holidays, had days out in other towns and cities, we've been through a few family crises and health scares and deaths and stood together through it. I didn't ever expect anyone would stick around this long or care about me so much. 

From just a good morning here and there and chatting on the benches while we waited for our kids to come out, she's become the person I want to tell everything to first, and she'll always want to know. I've never felt like an extra next to her. Being her friend taught me what a good friend should be. She reminded me that we were never meant to face it all alone. I just want to tell the world how much I love her and how she saved me during a very dark part of my life. 

I love to daydream and always wondered if I'd ever have a friend like in the movies, where we'd drive around together and hang out on the weekends and plan holidays together. She is that friend. Some of my best memories are now the day she came by my house for some stuff and joined me for a coffee on a school morning and we ended up talking for 3 hours. The afternoons we'd just sit in one of our cars talking while our kids were at activities and even the times she'd be getting groceries and text to ask if I needed her to pick up something.

I own a small book store. Open every day but Monday from noon to 6p.

About 90% of my shipments arrive days late. The driver constantly tries delivering in the morning before noon. He \*never\* leaves a tag saying he attempted delivery. I always find out when I hit ""track order"".

I'm sick of calling, going through the hoops, waiting on hold, etc. There has been two times I've been transferred to the local dispatch. Both times I was told ""our driver says your hours aren't posted or are inconsistent"" -- both times I tell them what our hours are.

(Also -- if he ever left a tag saying delivery attempted, he'd probably see the sign that shows our hours? The lack of tags is supremely frustrating).

He often drops off with our neighbor in the morning -- a coffee roaster that does have inconsistent hours. I don't think he bothers with us at all.

I've missed multiple orders for customers. Once a box that was supposed to arrive before Christmas arrived late because of this incident.

Anyway, I was excited for this shipment of new release books that was supposed to arrive today -- yet once again didn't due to this message We tried to deliver to the business, but it was closed. A second attempt will be made the next business day.

In my opinion, UPS has something similar to a monopoly -- I can't go through a different carrier because my warehouse doesn't offer a different one. If I could, I'd use FedEx. This is beyond frustrating and its been two years of this.

Any advice would be great. Someone to talk to on the phone or email or ?

Being a small business owner is stressful, and the margins are so low. Late shipments do affect sales, as well as the reputation of my business (as I try to carry new releases and special orders on schedule). I empathize with how hard it would be to deliver packages, but wish there was something I could do. But my strong intuition is he starts his morning route in the neighborhood of my shop, and just doesn't want to come back after noon.

  
P.S. Edit: I should also note -- once there was a shipment very important to me -- I came to the store two hours early to wait for UPS -- got the 'delivered' notification -- it went straight to the neighbor. Didn't even bother to see if I was here.",0,1758921242.0,UPS,7,0.5,False

Hey there, AI friends! 

So, let’s spill some tea. Are we really living in a world where you *have* to show your face to be successful? 🤔 Spoiler alert: NOPE! This month, we're diving into the magic of *faceless growth strategies* because honestly, who wants to put their mug on every platform? Not me, and I bet you can relate! 

Let's chat about some killer strategies that are working like a charm right now. No face required. 🙌

### Here’s what we’re claiming our faceless throne with:

1. **Content Automation**  
   Forget about filming yourself! Tools like [DS24](https://www.checkout-ds24.com/redir/540531/maximizeme/) make content creation feel like a breeze. Picture this: you punch in your ideas, and voila, AI churns out the goods. Sounds like magic, right? Seriously, it’s time to let the robots do their thing while you sit back and collect those gains.

2. **Social Media Scheduling**

1nrd6u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nrd6u4/an_otherworldly_scholar_litrpg_isekai_chapter_251/,"An Otherworldly Scholar [LitRPG, Isekai] - Chapter 251","Ghila stormed into Astur’s luxury tent with the rest of the instructors glued to her heels. I exchanged a knowing look with Holst, and we followed inside. The tent was more spacious inside than its outer perimeter suggested, with armchairs and a coffee table. Maybe an expansion enchantment? If teleportation were possible, subjective spaces might be as well, but no matter how much I looked around, I didn’t find the enchanted item that allowed the spatial buckle.

Though that may have been because Ghila’s dangerous aura prevented me from focusing.

“What’s wrong with you, Gwan? Cadets aren’t supposed to fight people until the end of the second year!” she shouted over the murmurs of the instructors.

She was furious.

“Dropouts have a whole year more of experience,” an instructor I haven’t met said.

“They must have ten levels above the cadets! Will their levels be bound by the Hex?” another shouted.

Astur remained serene. When he cleared his throat, the murmurs quietened.

“The cadets knew the risks when they signed up for the Academy,” he said. “To reach the heights we aim for, they’ll have to risk their lives, just as we did when we were young. I don’t think anyone here would disagree.”

The instructors mumbled, some convinced, others even more outraged.

There was a certain dose of truth in Astur’s words. If I hadn’t risked my life back at the Farlands, I wouldn’t have reached the Lv.45 or achieved a Prestige Class. To progress beyond the softcap, one had to punch upward. Still, a test—above all—should be fair.

A familiar voice carried above the sound of the small crowd. The voice was calm, although it had enough strength to get over the uproar. Holst. “Grandmaster Astur, is there any reason to put the children of half the kingdom’s noble families in such danger?”

The instructors quietened down.

Holst spoke again.

“If even one of them gets severely hurt, the political backlash will be immense. I recommend adopting a more conservative approach like we have done in previous years.”

I felt the tides changing. Holst was a great orator.

“Difficult times are coming, Darius. It’s no time to worry about political backlash, but rather about the strength of the kingdom,” Astur retorted, his charming voice coating his words with a layer of false truth.

Holst wasn’t impressed.

“The safety of the kingdom doesn’t rest on the shoulders of our cadets,” he said.

“It will in the future. My decision is final.”

“Then, I want to formally call for a veto of today’s selection exam.”

“You are not in charge, Darius,” Astur said, suddenly irritated.

“It falls within my authority as an instructor,” Holst replied, giving me a sidelong glance.

I silently thanked him. Nobody had given me a procedures manual, but it seemed Holst was speaking serious stuff because all the instructors became completely silent and focused on Astur. Inside the tent, there were twenty-three martial instructors plus a handful of magical instructors.

“Let's put it to a vote, then,” Astur said. “Those against conducting the selection exam on the basis of its dangerousness, raise your hands.”

All the magical instructors and about half of the martial instructors raised their hands. Holst, Ghila, and I also raised our hands. Fifteen votes in total. We had the majority, but my relief was short-lived.

“Rhovan, what in the everloving System?!” Ghila shouted.

Rhovan and his group’s hands remained down. They had moved to face the crowd, like they were Astur’s bodyguards. The other instructors exchanged nervous glances.

“Lord Astur speaks the truth. Cadets don’t become Imperial Knights by playing around in the safety of the capital,” he said, raising his voice. “How can you vote against him, Ghila? Didn’t you break the 30’s barrier when you were around their age? And you, Holst, didn’t you pick up the sword to fight a Monster Surge even though you were a Scholar?”

Although Holst and Ghila didn’t change their vote, two hands came down.

“Cadria is surrounded by monsters to the East, West, and North,” Rhovan continued. “Isn’t it our duty to create a force to keep it safe? You know how many Imperial Knights die each year. If we don’t temper our cadets now, they will shatter later. We don’t want that blood in our hands.”

Another hand came down.

“Anything else to say, Darius?” Astur asked with a satisfied smile.

“I still believe the methodology of this selection exam is reckless and bound to result in serious injuries, if not worse. A blacksmith can’t create a strong sword if he ruins the metal beforehand,” Holst said.

Seeing the tide was turning, many more martial instructors changed their vote.

“Duly noted. Those in favor of continuing with the exercise raise your hands.”

I cursed, lowering my hand. We had turned into a minority.

“The vote is over. The selection exam will continue as scheduled. You may leave.”

The instructors trickled outside the tent. Rhovan passed by my side with a smug grin. In his mind, tradition seemed to be more important than the safety of the cadets. Maybe Talindra was right about ‘the contents of his soul’.

“Ah, before I forget about it,” Astur said, and all the instructors stopped. “Robert Clarke, if you or your old students interfere in the exam… if any of you touch even a hair of any of the participants, I will disqualify your whole squad. Are we clear?”

In a single swoop, Astur shattered my plans of keeping some semblance of safety during the exam. If one of my students was going to be severely injured, I totally planned to interfere, even if that disqualified them. However, I couldn’t risk the whole squad being kicked from the Academy. Thinking about Leonie, Yvain, and Kili, I couldn’t just shatter their hopes.

“Are we clear, Instructor Clarke?”

“If any of my students are injured, I will hold you responsible,” I said loudly enough for everyone to hear.

Astur raised an eyebrow, and pure-white mana crackled around his arms. The atmosphere inside the tent became heavy, like someone had set a hungry tiger free. No one moved.

“Are you threatening me, Scholar?”

“Take it however you like,” I replied, turning my back to the mana demonstration and exiting the tent.

The cadets had somewhat dispersed, but a good portion of them were outside the tent, waiting for the meeting's outcome. The Cabbage squad was nowhere to be found. I pushed through the camp towards the corner where we’d had lunch.

“That was ballsy,” Holst said, catching up to me.

“And I appreciate your attempt; it was brave,” I replied.

“It was smart, not brave… although ineffective,” Holst corrected me, channeling his mana and using \[Minor Illusion\] to create a copy of the exam’s map. 

No, I reminded myself. Holst already had \[Mirage\] when he showed us his Character Sheet during Farcrest’s feast. 

A number floated on top of the map. 3914. The respective lines appeared connecting the dots in the shortest path possible. 

“I’m sure Astur created the exam to prevent teamwork, but there is a way,” Holst said.

Something clicked inside my mind. I channeled \[Mirage\] and created a translucent version of the map, but with a different number. 1403. The paths were diametrically different, except for the 1-4 section.

“It took you a moment,” Holst teased, just to regain his visage of detached seriousness an instant later. “The more cadets involved, the more overlapping paths we would have. Even if you have something like 1934, you don’t have to visit the stations in that order. A 1-4 path is possible.”

I was generally against teachers giving students the answers to a test, but it was Astur who threw the glove in the first place. Partial teamwork was still teamwork and a great way of maximizing our chances. A two-versus-one fight already tilted the scales towards the more numerous team, regardless of personal skill.

Holst still gave me ambivalent feelings, but I was glad we were on the same ship.

“What Rhovan said about you… Is it true?” I asked.

Not every Scholar decided to pick the sword. Holst must’ve had a reason, but I always assumed he was fishing for the Tactician Prestige Class.

“It was a pragmatic choice. Farcrest lacked soldiers thirty years ago. Still, I’d rather that knucklehead kept my private affairs to himself,” Holst grunted.

Thirty plus fifteen, made Holst at least forty-five years old. I thought he was younger. He certainly looked younger, but even back on Earth, there were people whose hair didn’t gray out until well into their forties.

“You fought alongside Izabeka,” I said matter-of-factly.

Holst sighed like a moody teenager answering the stupid questions of his younger brother.

“I’m a Holst. Of course I fought for the city. The fact I’m still alive should be proof enough I wasn’t anywhere near Izabeka,” he said.

The Kiln and the Holst families went back to the foundation of Farcrest. I wondered if Holst’s ancestors were warriors. As Izabeka described the city decades ago, it didn’t seem like a place for Scholars.

Just as I was going to continue with the interrogation, Ghila popped behind us like a ghost.

“What are you two plotting?” 

Surprise flashed over Holst’s face for a fraction of a second.

Even with \[Foresight\] active in the background of my mind, I hadn't detected her presence either.

“Scholar things. You wouldn't get it,” Holst said, dismissing his \[Mirage\].

He was cocky, considering Ghila could probably squash him with her thumb.

“Come on, if you’re going to do something, count me in,” she said.

Holst grunted. “Naïve.”

Ghila was set aback.

“Naive? You heard Rhovan. I massacred a bandit camp when I was fifteen. I think I can take the two of you if you cross me.”

Rhovan hadn’t gone into details about Ghila’s background. Hitting Lv.30 before turning eighteen, though, was something I’ve only ever heard Izabeka achieve—and she had killed a Forest Warden.

“Massacred?” I asked.

“I’d say that’s an adequate word.” Ghila nodded, pleased with herself. “They raided my village first, so they had it coming.”

Ghila was the first and foremost to storm into Astur’s tent, so it was hard not to trust her.

I shot Holst a questioning look.

“Fine,” he said. “Instructor Aravel, please memorize the numbers of your students' badges and meet us. We have a plan.”

Ghila smiled.

“Of course you have a plan, you plotting library rat.”

It wasn’t hard to tell why Ghila liked Firana so much. In a sense, they seemed to be kindred spirits. 



\* \* \*



Planning the paths for almost forty cadets was nothing short of a Master’s thesis in complexity. To be fair, I had no idea what Master’s students did for their thesis, but this was a traveling salesman problem on steroids. Sure, I could identify my variables, and I knew I was in front of an optimization problem—if we found the minimal amount of paths that could be traveled within the time limit by the most amount of cadets at any time, we would have a good density of individuals in each part of the path—but I wasn’t sure I knew enough math to solve it. My mind was full of rather simple geometry minimization problems, but nothing of the magnitude of this problem.

Vigdis Herran offered me a frozen piece of cloth, and I put it on my forehead, held in place by a mana hand. I felt like my brain was on fire. Finding the most traveled path was as easy as finding the most common pair of numbers on the cadets’ badges; however, we needed to consider team constraints. Not only did the cadets have to travel the same path, but they had to do it at the same time.

Holst’s method was simpler… and ruthless. He split the cadets into three groups: strong cadets, weak cadets, and fast cadets. Unsurprisingly, it turned out to be way easier to work with only a third of the variables. Strong cadets and fast cadets had leeway. Leonie, for instance, could probably win against a dropout, and Kili could get away without much trouble.

Working around the ‘weak’ cadets, those who were weaker in combat or had time-constrained routes, gave better results.

In my squad, Malkah was the one in greater danger. Not only did his combination of numbers create rather long pathways, but his powers wouldn’t show in their full strength if he wasn’t wounded. Wounded meant slow, and slow meant failing.

Ilya was working by my side. Despite not having as much math knowledge, her theory about heat maps was interesting. The cadets didn’t have to travel the same pathway to meet; they could also meet in intersections and adjacent paths.

The cadets had jumped into the wagon surprisingly easily. Cabbage Class got along fine, but Holst’s Basilisk Class and Ghila’s Gaiarok Class didn’t seem to have that kind of relationship. Still, everyone wanted to maximize their chances to pass, and although nobody said it and most of them tried to hide it, they were afraid.

The cadets had reached the same conclusion across the camp. Last year’s dropouts were strong enough to pass the entrance exam, and they’d had a whole year to gather experience and level up. Imperial dropouts were still a valuable resource regardless of the time spent at the Academy. Most ended up working for famous merchant guilds or as the personal guards of lesser nobles.

Something was bothering me.

Was I going to be able to stop a fight and sentence the whole squad?

The more I thought about it, the more I wanted to strangle Astur—or at least key his carriage. Conversely, having a problem to work on was having a soothing effect on my mood. I felt less irritable than before. And we had enough personnel even with us five out of the picture.

“I’m sorry about earlier,” Ilya suddenly said.

She remained focused on the list of numbers before her.

“It’s fine,” I replied, softly elbowing her shoulder. “I will not hide the cookies on the highest shelf, then.”

Ilya rolled her eyes, but crawled next to me and continued working.

“You know your jokes are bad, right?”

“Then why are you smiling?”

I wondered if Firana had put an invisible Ward around me, because as soon as Ilya came close, her eyes shot up towards us. This time, however, she seemed to accept Ilya’s closeness. 

By nightfall, we had a sufficiently good solution for the cadet’s pathing problem. Holst was scary smart. Although he didn’t have the arithmetic tools, he had the intuition of the geometrician of old.

Working around the ‘weaker’ cadets had been the easiest method. Ilya even teased Holst, noting how much he had changed. Years ago, he would’ve let the weaker cadets fail. Surprisingly enough, Holst rolled with the punches.

“Enough for today. We need to be well-rested for tomorrow,” I said, loud enough for the cadets who had been orbiting around us to go back to the communal tent. 

The group dispersed, but I caught up to Leonie when nobody was watching.

The cadet’s padded jacket was a Masterwork-rank armor created with a mix of high-quality fibers and magical materials. It provided as much protection as a non-enchanted garment could, but not enough to quell my worries. Their opponents, after all, would be unbound Lv.20s.

Considering Astur’s threats, a bit of cheating wasn’t out of the question.

“Leonie, bring the shirts of the whole squad to my tent. Discreetly.”

The girl looked confused, so I covered my mouth with my hand and leaned next to her ear.

“I have a reinforcement spell that might be of use.”

Leonie's eyes widened.

“I-I can't. That would be cheating!” she muttered.

“Yes, but Astur said he’d expel the entire squad if I or my former students got involved in the exam. I don’t have a choice. If one of you ends up in danger, I won’t be able to step in,” I replied, turning around and returning to my shelter. “That’s why I’m asking you to be the judge.”

I couldn’t see her, but I heard a long sigh and the footsteps of the girl walking in the opposite direction.

Contingency plans within contingency plans.

What Astur did not count on was our other helpers. Firana, Zaon, Ilya, Wolf, and I might have our hands tied, but we still had the other third-year students: the Wolfpack, the Rosethorn Squad, and the Black Basilisk Squad. 

I returned to my shelter, satisfied with our work, only lamenting the fact that I couldn’t arm the other squads in the team with enchanted shirts. I might be able to fool a bunch of teenagers, but Holst and Ghila would totally notice the ‘fortifying spell’ was really an enchantment. 

I was deep in thought, wondering if I could convince the world I only had an exotic skill, like the Librarians of Byrne’s Arcane Circle, so I didn’t notice Ghila waiting by my shelter, backpack on her shoulder.

“Do a sister a favor, you have plenty of space inside there,” Ghila said with an impish smile.

No wonder she hadn’t bothered raising her own tent. She was a freeloader.

“No. I’m in a committed relationship.”

“Come on, we are allies! I don’t want to get bugs.”

“And I don’t want nasty rumors. I’m already on thin ice as it is.”

Ghila sighed.

“Aight, gonna share space with this majestic beast,” she said, sitting under the Bucko’s overhanging roof.

To my surprise, Bucko didn't seem to have any problems with the woman’s presence.

I massaged my temples. If Ghila remained there, she would see Leonie carrying the shirts. She could even peek to see me runeweaving.

“I guess we are allies, after all,” I sighed.

Ghila jumped to her feet and pulled the fabric covering the entrance aside. I cleared my throat and pointed a few meters away from my shelter. Ghila smiled, and a moment later, a second stone shelter appeared out of nowhere. Many cadets’ heads popped outside their tents to see what all the noise was about. \[Minor Geokinesis\] wasn’t a subtle spell.

Ghila remained unconcerned about their angry glances.

“You are a lifesaver, Robert Clarke,” she said, throwing her loose tent over the shelter to block the entrance.

Unbeknownst to her, I had intentionally placed her shelter facing away from mine.

I smiled and waved as she closed the makeshift curtain behind her.

As the cold wind from the mountain tops was blowing into the valley, I returned to my shelter. The stone was warm, and a couple of strategically placed Light Stones made the place feel surprisingly cozy. 

Like clockwork, Leonie squeezed her head through the gap between the fabric and the stone. She dropped eleven shirts into the shelter and left without saying a word. I could read her expression, though. She wasn’t comfortable with our small act of cheating.

“As expected of the daughter of a Knight…” I said, leaving the last syllable in the air. “...and a Fey.”

I spied outside my shelter, feeding \[Foresight\] as much mana as I could without making me feel dizzy. Everyone was sleeping. I grabbed the first shirt. Considering the size, it was either Kili’s or Rup’s. I applied the Reinforce-Insulation effect with the Gradual trigger and the Absorption energy source. I also added an underpowered Conceal rune, which I had gotten from Byrne’s documents, to make the enchantment less obvious. 

I remembered when a five-rune string took me minutes to finish. Now, I could have them ready in a few seconds. Before I could continue thinking about Byrne, I grabbed the next shirt, which was dusty-brown instead of white.

“Weren’t they traveling by cart? Why would someone roll on the ground?”

1nrd3w5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkStories/comments/1nrd3w5/i_work_for_a_horror_movie_studio_i_just_read_a/,I Work for a Horror Movie Studio... I Just Read a Script Based on My Childhood Best Friend [Pt 1],"\[Hello everyone.  

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.   

TITLE: **ASILI**   

\[So, that was the cold open to *ASILI*, the screenplay you just read. If you happen to wonder why this opening takes place in prehistoric times, well here is why... What you just read was actually a dream sequence of Henry’s. You see, once Henry was in the jungle, he claimed to have these very lucid dreams of the jungle’s terrifying history – even as far back as prehistory... I know, pretty strange stuff. 

Make sure to tune in next week for the continuation of the story, where we’ll be introduced to our main characters before they answer the call to adventure.

Well… today has been a hell of a day.

Morning started routine enough. Mercer was ferrying men in and out of the ice base, hauling anything of value before we put charges to the place at noon. Radar arrays humming, skies clear except for aurora and stars. Everything smooth, like clockwork.

Then I headed back toward my quarters around 0900, and I heard it... some poor ensign’s voice cracking at full volume:

“I–I don’t know where he is, ma’am!” Minnesota accent so thick it could’ve been a different language.

Then her voice cut through, clear as a bell and regal as a coronation:
“Why are you yelling at me? And where is  Maximillius?”

A sharp whump followed, the sound of a bare foot stomping deck plate. “I am cold, and I desire food!”

I rounded the corner, and hell’s bells! There she stood.

Ursula.
Not a stitch on her.
Standing proud as a queen, one hand pinning that poor kid against the bulkhead by sheer force of presence alone.

The ensign’s eyes were bugging like a frog on a griddle, fighting a three-front war: hormones pulling him one way, naval propriety the other, and raw survival instinct screaming not to stare at the most perfect chest the ocean ever produced.

For what it’s worth, he was putting up a good fight... But it was a losing battle. Poor kid’s face was red enough to sell as penny candy. His eyes kept pinwheeling, desperate to look at anything that wasn’t her. Good man.

I rounded the corner and barked:

“Ursula! Hands off that sailor!”

She had the gall to beam over her shoulder at me like a schoolgirl caught at mischief, then skipped toward me in little fairy steps.

“Good morrow, Maximillius! I was looking for you!”

Now I was the one fighting a war. Christ in heaven! The woman just stood there... like that! It was easy to see why the kid was having such trouble. I’ve been in a lot of ports, so to speak, but they don’t build ’em like that above the waterline, I’ll tell you that much. I almost abandoned the kid to be eaten alive by the fish woman just to save my dignity.

The ensign squeaked, voice barely holding together: “C–can I go now?”

Without even glancing at him, she flicked her hand like she was dismissing a butler. “Yes. You may go.”

I shot her a look. She only grinned wider. God! She was trouble on new feet!

“He was talking to me, your highness.” Then, to the kid: “Dismissed, Ensign. Report back to the radio room. And be ready to change over.”

“Aye aye, Chief!” He saluted so hard he nearly poked his own eye out, then bolted like he’d been shot from one of the 5-inch guns.

She cocked her head at me, face the very picture of concern, and laid a hand on my chest.

“Max, are you well? You look ill, and your heart is like thunder.”

I shook my head to clear it.
“Never mind that. I’m fine, woman. Get in here!”

I hauled her into my quarters by the elbow.
“What the hell are you doing, wandering around the boat naked as the day you were born? You can’t do that!”

“Unhand me, you brute!” she barked, yanking her arm free. Her eyes flashed like I’d offended royalty. “And why should I not? Am I a prisoner? That was not our deal!”

“What? No! I just mean you can’t be strutting around in your all-together in front of sailors!”

She crossed her arms under her chest (which did nothing to help the situation) and sniffed. “Then perhaps your sailors should learn not to gape.”

What the hell are you supposed to say to that? Because she was absolutely right.
But that was neither here nor there.

She needed clothes. I wasn’t going to argue.

I dug through my footlocker and yanked out my dress uniform. Tossed the shirt and jacket at her.

“Look, it’ll cause problems, okay? Let’s just agree you won’t wander around nude. Start with this, put the white one on first. Pants later.”

I turned my back to her whilst she dressed. Not that she cared. It was more about my manners. She groused the whole time.

“This is absurd! And what material is this? It is stiff as coral! And how am I supposed to work these toggles?! They are out of reach beyond the third one!”

That made me turn... and sure enough, she had the damned thing on backwards. I barked out a laugh. That earned me a glare sharp enough to sink a destroyer.

“Are you mocking me?”

“No, ma’am."" I said, trying to be sincere and contain the guffaw but she looked ridiculous. ""Here, let me give you a hand with that.”

I righted the shirt, fingers working the buttons while she grumbled like a queen denied tribute.

“First you brutalize me, then you laugh at me for not understanding your strange robes!"" She whined, talking with her hands as much as her mouth. Worse than dressing a damned kid. ""How am I to understand these things? It is not my fault you people no longer wear tunics. And why are you shaking so?”

Of course I was shaking. Any red-blooded man would’ve. She looked like sin wrapped in moonlight, and all I had between us was a handful of Navy buttons.

And those things aren’t stitched on very well!

Then I noticed something damned strange. My hands froze halfway up her shirt, and without thinking I ran a palm along her ribs.

“What the hell…”

She leaned back against the bunk, eyes fixed on me, calm as a cat.
“What do you see, Maximillius?”

It was what I didn’t see.

The flesh that had been carved out of her ribs was whole. No stitches. No sutures. Just a line of faint, pink new scars, smooth as if the wound had been weeks old instead of hours.

I traced the new scar tissue with my fingertips, and she let loose with a chuckle.

“The interesting parts are higher, I believe,” she purred.

I realized where my hands were and I snatched my hands back like I’d grabbed a live wire. “Sorry about that… it’s just... Christ, that’s impossible! You were carved up like a tuna a few hours ago!”

“Yes.” She tilted her head, eyes glinting. “I got better.”

I felt something crawl up my spine at the simplicity with which she said it. Like it was a papercut and not half the skin on her ribs hanging off. 

So… I decided I was not going to deal with that.

She needed pants.

I tore through the locker for anything that might fit her. No dice. Everything I had would’ve made her look like a kid lost in her old man’s overalls. She’s so damned small... barefoot, maybe five-four.

She scowled at each attempt, muttering about “coral-stiff fabric” and “Max’s foolish insistence on garments.” Finally, she huffed, marched over to the bunk, and snatched up a spare pillowcase.

Before I could so much as bark at her to quit, she ripped the seams with a neat little tug, like she’d been doing needlework her whole life, and tied the thing around her hips. One knot, one tuck, and damned if she didn’t look like she was wearing some kind of Grecian skirt.

A pillowcase! On a U.S. Navy destroyer, in the middle of the Arctic, and she struts around like she’s at a coronation ball. 

And has the gall to complain she’s cold!

And she wasn’t done. She went straight to my ruck, tore it apart with her nails (which cut through the canvas like warm butter) and fashioned herself a pair of sandals from the rawhide straps.

“There!” she declared, triumphant. “Now I am robed. Can we go eat now, or must I veil my head as well?”

And so she was: my dress shirt hanging to her thighs, a pillowcase tied clever as a skirt, rawhide sandals laced around her small feet, and that long black hair spilling down her back like wet silk.

She cut an odd figure, no doubt. Half like a lost girl playing dress-up, half like some voodoo priestess come to bless a battlefield.

The boys were going to eat me alive when they saw this. I draped my dress jacket over her shoulders. 

I led Ursula through the passageways toward the galley, and the woman insisted on touching everything. Every valve, every wheel, every damn knob that jutted from the bulkhead seemed to fascinate her like it was some kind of relic. Brass especially! God help me, she couldn’t keep her hands off the brass. 

Part fish, part magpie.

The ship was going like a kettle around us. The steel decks throbbed faintly with the vibration of the screws. We ducked through a hatch, the overhead so low I had to stoop, and squeezed past an engineer sprawled in the passage, elbows deep in a length of hissing pipe. Ursula leaned down as casual as you please and plucked a spare pressure gauge out of his toolbox like it was a seashell left out just for her.

“Hey, fucknugget!” the kid shouted, wrench slipping in his hand. He yanked his goggles off, ready to bite someone’s head off on instinct. Then he saw her.

He froze, eyes wide, mouth hanging open like he’d just laid eyes on Neptune’s daughter herself. “Put that b-b… back… Ma’am?”

I snapped the thing out of her hand before she could pocket it and shoved it back into his box. “Sorry about her. Carry on, sailor.”

The grease monkey blinked, still staring, jaw slack. Ursula just looked at me with wide-eyed innocence, like I was the unreasonable one. I didn’t like that look, so I eased my tone. “Urs… he needs that to do his job. What he does is incredibly important to keep this tug running. You can’t just be picking things up.”

She blinked at me, long lashes fluttering like she was weighing the words. “I see. You could have simply explained that. You didn’t have to snatch the talisman from my hand as if I were a child.” Then her eyes narrowed, a tiny curl of amusement tugging at her lips. “Also… Urs?”

I hadn’t thought that through. Hell, I had no idea if that was insulting to her or not. “Sorry about that, Ursula.”

She tilted her head, studying me for a long moment. Then, softer: “No, no. It is quite fine… Max.”

The way she said the shortened version of my name (like it was some sort of blessing instead of a nickname) went through me worse than the cold outside or galley coffee. 

She strode past, head held high with pride. “It has been so long since anyone has laid claim to me with any name of favoritism. I will take it, even if it is lazy.”

Laying claim?! 

No! Absolutely not! 
It was just a nickname!

It meant absolutely fuck all... But lazy?! How was it lazy? I been called a lot of things. Stubborn, bullheaded, hatchet faced... but lazy I ain't! That one stung. And worse, the little minx knew it! She flashed a wild grin over her shoulder, like she was checking to make sure her shot landed. 

“Lazy?!” I sputtered, nearly choking on my own tongue.  “I’m not..."" She strode toward the end of the hallway and missed the turn. ""Where the hell are you going? Grub’s this way, ya royal pain in my ass…” I rushed forward and put my arm through hers with a grin. For all her weirdness... She was trying to be friendly.

I had no idea if I could trust it, but... Ah hell. Ok, it was working. She's charming in her own strange way. 

The mess deck was a roaring steel cave of clatter and stink. It was the same old smells as always. The smell of fresh toast, the stink of something the Navy had the balls to call meat, and burnt coffee were thick enough to choke a mule. 

And the noise is always the same. The yelling of men jawing over cards, arguments over work, and complaints about the chow. Somebody had a game of dice going in a corner.

And then we stepped through the hatch.

Me, trying to look like an XO with half a brain left.
Her… barefoot-but-not, skirt swishing, my damn dress shirt swallowing her frame, black hair shining like it had no business in a steel box at sea. And her arm tucked smug as you please into mine, chin high like she was the Queen of the Atlantic out for a Sunday stroll. 

The sound died in a wave. Not all at once. First the boys nearest the hatch clammed up, forks frozen mid-bite. Then the ones across the tables, laughter strangling in their throats. Until the whole damn deck went quiet except for the rattle of the ship’s guts and somebody’s coffee sloshing in a cup.

A hundred eyes bored into us, every man’s brain trying to answer one of three questions: Who the hell is she? Why’s she dressed like that? or Why the hell is she clinging to the XO like that? 

And then, like the cherry on this shit sundae, some jackass at the back of the mess deck shouted:

“OFFICER ON DECK!”

Every chair screeched back at once. Tin trays clattered down. A hundred sailors shot to their feet so fast you’d think the Admiral himself had come to inspect the galley.

And there I stood.
Not with a clipboard. Not with a scowl.
With her on my arm, strutting like she owned the place in my shirt and a damn pillowcase.

She smiled like it was her coronation. Hell, she even gave the tiniest nod, like she was acknowledging her subjects.

Meanwhile, I was dying inside.

Why did I think this was a good idea? I could have gone to the wardroom! The officers knew the score... But my instincts were always to eat with the enlisted. 

I was about to bark at them to stow that shit when she spoke first.

“Thank you all for this great show of respect,” Ursula said, voice ringing like she was addressing Congress instead of a steel lunchroom. “But please, return to your meals. Do not let my presence disrupt...”

I clamped a hand over her mouth before she could crown herself Queen of the Mess Deck.

“As you were, fellas,” I growled, trying for XO authority and landing closer to frantic babysitter. “Don’t mind us.”

That broke the dam.

The laughter came first, sharp and loud enough to rattle the overhead. Then the wolf whistles. Then the tide of lechery... sailors calling out “Save some for me, Chief!” and “Hey sweetheart, you got a sister?” and ""Nobody told me we could've brought dames on this tour!”

My face went redder than the engineer’s toolbox. Ursula? She just blinked at me over my hand, eyes glinting with something between amusement and predatory glee. 

And then she bit me!

Right on the meat of my ring finger! It wasn't enough to draw blood, but it hurt bad enough to make me hiss and snatch my hand back like I’d grabbed a hot stovepipe. 

She just stood there licking her lips, smug as could be, like she’d planned the whole thing. Smiling at me like nipping my fingers meant nothing more than a good little prank. 

Single women ought not be biting a fella! 

“What the hell was that for?” I hissed, shaking out my hand. “Are you crazy?”

“I told you that I desire food, Max,” she said softly, smiling like the cat that got the canary. “I assumed you were offering your hand as tribute.”

“Oh, hardy har har."" I said as sarcastic as I could manage. ""You’re a regular barrel of laughs.” I flexed my bitten finger and choked back the laugh. 

I didn't want to give her the point. 

But… dammit. That was pretty funny.

I shuffled her into line and slapped a tray in her hands. The cooks gave her a look like they’d never seen a woman before (and hell, most of ’em probably hadn’t in weeks). She just nodded like it was her own parade review.

The cook, big fella named Braden, (arms like boiled hams) squinted at her tray, then at her. “Lady, you eat this stuff, it’ll peel the paint off your stomach.”

I groaned. “When the galley boys start warning you about the kip, it’s best to listen.”

“What’s the menu today, Cooky?” I asked, though I already dreaded the answer.

“Shredded liver in gravy on toast. With a side of beans and hash.”

“Jesus, why? That’s what we had for dinner last night.”

“I know.” He shook his head, ladle dripping its brown gray muck. He stared at the concoction like it might look back at him. “This is a rerun.”

“I will have two servings of everything, kind sir,” Ursula told him, flashing a smile bright enough to blind the whole mess.

Little shit has no right being that perfect. 

I know what's under her skin.

Just waiting to be unleashed... to devour the very hands that now slopped gray muck and toast onto her tray... But it's hard to keep that top of mind when she's flouncing around being so damned precocious. 

Cooky certainly wasn't immune to it. He slopped the tray slap full for her. I ignored the gravy and just took the toast dry and had a serving of hash. I grabbed both of us a cup of coffee. 

I shook my head as I looked at her balancing the piles of muck. “Two servings, she says. Hell, half the ship’ll be fighting you for the head by sundown.”

We made our way to a little table at the back. She sat without a moments hesitation between two young fellas who instantly scooted to give her some elbow room. I thudded down across from her. 

She started to reach for the gray mound of slop with her fingers and I whacked her on the back of her hand without thinking. ""Don't eat with your fingers, ya little savage. Use a fork!"" She flashed me a look that could have melted steel. I gave her my best shit-eating grin. ""It's the one with the spikes on the end. Like your personality."" 

She glared but I guess what with having food this close, it wasn't worth giving me a retort. Ursula didn’t hesitate. Didn’t even pause to study the slop like a sane person would. She scooped up a forkful of liver and hash the size of a fist and crammed it in her mouth.

The sound she made... Good Lord above... the kind of low, throaty moan you’d expect out of a house of ill repute, not a destroyer’s mess deck. Then she laughed through a mouthful, delighted, and went back for more, chewing like a damned buzzsaw.

It wasn’t just speed. It was raw and unabated gorging. Frenzied and sharp, like she was afraid the somebody would snatch the food away. Fork, hand, didn’t matter, she switched between them like both were just tools of the hunt.

And every time she swallowed, she sighed. A long, obscene sound of satisfaction that hit every sailor in earshot like a depth charge.

The poor kids sitting next to her we're doing their absolute best to ignore it but were slowly changing color from pale to pink around the cheeks. 

Even I have to admit, it was getting a little warmer...

In answer to this the mess deck turned into a madhouse. Men hollering, pounding the tables, wolf whistles echoing off the steel bulkheads. Somebody in the back hollered, ""Somebody is thanking the cook!”

Me? I wondered how bad it would hurt if I just hopped the gunwale. 

The kid sitting beside her, barely old enough to shave, dropped her some awful line and let his hand drift a little too close to her tray, maybe thinking she’d share a bite of beans with all her carrying on. 

Bad move.

A sound ripped out of her throat. Low and  guttural. Like something feral and definitely not human. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand straight up. Her eyes went black, flat and depthless, like some abyssal thing that had never seen the sun.

She clamped down on the boy’s wrist with a grip that made him yelp. For a heartbeat, the whole table froze. Every man there felt it, that wrongness rolling off her in waves.

Then, just as quick, she blinked and her eyes went back to normal. She released him, and went back to chewing liver like nothing had happened.

The kid sat there pale as chalk, rubbing his wrist, trying real hard to laugh it off but not quite getting there.

“Easy, son,” I said, leaning across the table, my voice steady as I could make it. “She’s been Jerry’s prisoner for quite a while. They were starving her, in addition to God knows what else. She’s a little touchy about her grub.”

That got a ripple of uneasy chuckles, the tension bleeding out. Forks clattered, somebody muttered “can’t blame her there,” and the noise of the mess picked up again though I noticed no one else reached too close to her tray.

She slowed her inhalation of the muck long enough to respond, ""Tis true. I have had next to no repast in nigh on a fortnight. ""

The table went quiet for half a breath, the words hanging in the air like some Willy Shakespeare line dropped into a game of craps. Then the whole place, me included, exploded into laughter.

“Miss… I have no idea what you just said,” one of the younger sailors blurted, grinning.

An older fella leaned back with his coffee and fired back: “Ain’t got a clue either, son, but it sure sounded purty!”

That lit the fuse again. Trays banged, laughter rolled, and just like that she wasn’t a danger, or a queen, or even a stranger... just part of the mess-deck circus.

But Ursula shot me the purest look of confusion I’d ever seen. Honest and wide-eyed like she couldn’t fathom why her words had turned the whole room into a joke.

I leaned across the table, lowering my voice so it was just for her. “Nobody talks like that anymore, Urs. You sound like a character out of community theater or something. It just tickles the ear a little funny, that’s all.”

That seemed to settle her, though the whole table was now shifting awkward-like, having cottoned on to the fact that she was bothered. 

A few of the young fellas rubbed their necks, muttering “Aw, shucks, we was just joshin’ miss.” One or two more gave sheepish apologies, while others, God help ’em, started offering lessons right there.

“You shoulda just said ‘couple weeks,’ miss,” one piped up.

“Or ‘ain’t ate in a while,’” another added.

“Hell, the classy way’s just, ‘I have been hungry too long,’” an older hand grumbled, but his smile said he meant no harm.

The laughter picked up again, softer this time, more like they were trying to fold her in instead of laughing her out.

She tilted her head, curious instead of wounded. Her eyes flicked from one sailor to the next as they offered their “translations.”

Then she did something damned uncanny.

Her lips barely moved, but she repeated each version of the phrase back in the exact voice of the man who’d said it. The kid’s cracked tenor, the older fella’s gravelly drawl, even the high nasal twang of the old man from Oklahoma. It was absolutely perfect, like some ventriloquist act running backward. 

The whole table went silent for half a heartbeat. 

Then somebody muttered, “Sweet jumpin’ Jesus…”

And the place became noise. Some fellas were laughing, some were hollering, and all of them were spooked like they’d seen a ghost do a card trick. One joker shouted, “XO, you brought a parrot on board!”

“I am no parrot,” Ursula said proudly, chin high. “I simply have perfect pitch and tonal control.”

One of the younger sailors piped up, grinning ear to ear. “Oh yeah? Can ya do your old man then?”

She blinked, puzzled. “My old man?” I nearly choked to death on toast. 

“Y’know,” another chimed in, elbowing the first, “your beau, the Chief.""

""Yea! Do the XO!"" Somebody chimed in. 

""Yes, c'mon miss! Let's hear ya copy Maxy boy!""

I finally choked down the toast and my head snapped up like a hound on point. “Alright, which wiseass said Maxy boy?” I barked, then turned back to Ursula. “Don’t encourage these animals.”

But of course she did.

She shot to her feet, tray rattling the table, and belted across the mess deck, “Let’s kill some of this noise! Some of us are trying to eat our chow in peace!”

In my voice. My exact goddamn voice.

Two sailors at the back of the chow line jerked around and saluted before they realized it wasn’t me.

That did it. The whole place went up like a powder keg... men howling, lecherous shouting, fellas damn near falling out of their seats.

And Ursula? She sat down smug as a queen, liver in one hand, fork in the other, grinning like she’d just won a prizefight.

I tried to laugh with the boys, I really did. But a thought crept in, sour as bad coffee.

It was all fun and games now, sure. A neat little trick for the mess deck. But what if she pulled that stunt over the radio? What if she started barking orders in my voice?

The ship would spin on a dime. Engines to full, guns manned, God knows what else. And all of it with my name stamped on it.

I glanced at her, smiling and smug, chewing through gray sludge like it was caviar.

Christ almighty. She was trouble. Trouble with a capital T.

The laughter was still booming around us, men pounding trays and wiping tears from their eyes, when I caught her face change.

One moment Ursula was basking in it, smug as a cat in the creamery. The next, her expression went flat. Cold. Like a switch had been thrown.

Then, without warning, her eyes filled and tears spilled down her cheeks. She pushed back from the bench and stood, voice trembling but clear:

“Max… I need to go to your house of sickness. Where your physicians work.”

My stomach dropped. I shot up so fast I nearly toppled the table. “Christ almighty, are you hurt? Can you walk, Urs? Do I need to carry you?”

A dozen voices chorused around me, the laughter gone. “Need a hand, Chief?” “We’ll help, ma’am!” “Easy does it.” Genuine, earnest offers, every one.

But the most useful came from old Gunner’s Mate Carpenter at the far end, voice cutting through the din like a bosun’s whistle:

“Make a hole! XO and the lady coming through!”

The men surged to their feet, trays and boots scraping back, clearing a path before I even had her by the elbow.

She sniffed, straightened, and nodded, though her tears kept rolling. “I am fine… but we must make haste.”

I don’t think I’ve ever gotten anyone to the infirmary faster in my life.
And “infirmary” is a generous word. On a Fletcher, it’s just a steel broom closet with delusions of grander. Two extra bunks bolted to the bulkhead, a couple locked cabinets full of bandages and sulfa powder, and enough medical hoopla to look official if you squint.

And one poor pharmacist’s mate. Old Doc was an aging old salt... used to patching up busted knuckles from card games or the odd broken bone from a ladderwell fall.

Today… wasn’t one of those days.

The space hit me like a fist. No air to breathe, just steel bulkheads pressing in, the stink of iodine fighting a losing war against blood, sweat, and something worse. The heavy reek of acid, sharp enough to bite the back of my throat.

Two men lay inside. Two men who weren’t going to see the dusk. 

The Whetstone must’ve booted them back here once the call was made. No sense clogging their ward with lost causes. Better to let the Cassius Clay carry her own dead weight.

The first man... hell. He was cooked. Half his right side blackened, skin peeling back like wet paper. Some places it was gone altogether, right down to the ivory shine of bone. And it wasn’t fire that did it. No flame on God’s earth burns like that. Looked more like he’d been dunked in a tank of the stuff,  the battery juice still eating at him even while the old fart with the caduceus on his sleeve tried to wash it away.

And the other...

God damn it!

The other was Rocket Joe.

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:

Do you know things about cars? Are you tired of giving advice to your own kids that barely listen anyway? Do you like free beer and have a little too much free time? Then this post is for you! 

Can I buy you a beer/coffee, tell you my vehicular situation and what my mechanics have said, and you put in your two cents? I don't need any mechanical work, mostly just need a kind word, maybe a hug. I'm trying not to throw good money after bad, but between my lack of knowledge and how overwhelming this whole situation has been, I just don't trust my decision-making. I can't afford a $10,000 repair on a 20 year old car worth maybe 2 grand. I make under $30,000 annually. I still have 4 grand left on my auto loan for it. And I really love this car.  

Why am I coming to reddit rather than someone I know? My father and I have been estranged for over a decade. He's a mechanic, and I have a few fond early memories of helping him work on his motorcycle, or detailing cars with him before he flipped them. In my late teens, he had something of a breakdown, cheated on his wife of nearly 20 years, beat the crap out of my barely teen-aged brother, and we haven't seen him since. I miss my dad, in so many ways. In situations like this, I miss him all the more. All I want to do is call my daddy and ask his advice. But since that's not an option, I decided to try to outsource to the Internet! There's gotta be a dad out there who can adopt a kid for a couple of hours! 

I'm in Beaverton, near Washington Square. If you have some free time in the next week or so, leave a comment/send a message and we can set something up!

Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.   

TITLE: **ASILI**   

\[So, that was the cold open to *ASILI*, the screenplay you just read. If you happen to wonder why this opening takes place in prehistoric times, well here is why... What you just read was actually a dream sequence of Henry’s. You see, once Henry was in the jungle, he claimed to have these very lucid dreams of the jungle’s terrifying history – even as far back as prehistory... I know, pretty strange stuff. 

Make sure to tune in next week for the continuation of the story, where we’ll be introduced to our main characters before they answer the call to adventure. 

Thanks for reading everyone, and feel free to leave your thoughts and theories in the comments.

How I should even tell my doctor, I don’t want him to take it away from me because it’s not working. Any tips you’ve noticed to help deal with your day to day tasks when the meds do not work! And you lack ALL motivation and care of it 

For context: 
- Healthcare provider is Kaiser Permanente
- Work remote(very demanding lots of calls meetings reoccurring tasks)
- Currently on 30 mg IR (6am take 2 meds no food, protein drink 11am-12pm take my second one(just 1)
-  Sometimes I have coffee if I need to kick start it (don’t do too often and if I do I wait 1-2hrs after I’ve taken my meds and always on my second dose of the day)
-  I force myself to eat or I do not eat at all. If I eat, it’s rice eggs bread sandwich. (Did not have this problem with my 10mg IR)


So I’ve been on Adderall for about a year now and I’ve always had 10IR mg. It was great until I got used to it and needed to increase my dose so then we went to 20IR mg and when I took my first dose, I woke up late for work. I was extremely tired. I honestly didn’t feel like it was working so I told my doctor and he said well let’s prescribe you 40 XR in my head. I was thinking whoa that’s kind of a huge jump but okay! Ive taken XR when first trying to figure out what is the right fit and I didn’t feel like it worked with me

 So I took my dose of 40XR I worked for about 3-4 hours it was good! But then it didn’t kick in again like it’s supposed to.  So I took the left over 20IR (when I take 3 it actually works. Ik probably not good) told my doctor (I speak to a different nurse at office every time) and this nurse LITERALLY said after I explained  “Okay so what do you want? Do you want a higher dose? Do you want to change your med?” And in my head I was thinking, aren’t you supposed to help me into figuring out what the best solution would be? I really said okay, I guess we can do a 30 mg IR. 


I’ve been on 30 mg for about two weeks now and at first it was okay I was just over going back an forth with calling constantly. So I just dealt with it and been taking two to feel more effective.

When I mean it worked I mean I still 
I can still get things done, but it takes me much longer to start and finish tasks.
It doesn’t give me that focused, motivated feeling that the 10mg IR provided me. 


I know there is a shortage going on right now and maybe me going to IR to XR and back to IR fucked with me but I only took XR twice. I have an appointment with my doctor my actual psychiatrist to try to figure out a plan because it’s not even just affecting my work. It’s affecting my life, I literally don’t eat and I have force food down or just drink a protein shake. I’ve been having really weird side effects that I haven’t had before maybe relating to everything 

- My hands get extremely dry and wrinkly after just washing them or showering, even if I’m only in water for a minute or two.

- My hair has been way drier, and I’ve been getting dandruff more often. I usually only need to wash my hair once a week, but now I have to wash it twice.

- I feel overwhelmed much more easily and don’t always know where to start, which makes it hard to stay on top of tasks. 

- I leave tasks that will take less than five minutes until the last minute when I’m needing to do longer task

- My mouth doesn’t get as dry, but it either is extremely dry or extremely wet 


Any advice or tips would help please! Thank you!

1nrcuqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1nrcuqf/i_used_reverse_psychology_on_my_husband_and_it/,I used reverse psychology on my husband and it worked.,"I do the bulk of the household chores, cooking, pet care, childcare, errands, shopping, and scheduling. 
We both work 40+ hours a week, we both make around the same (putting this out there right off the bat before it's assumed I'm a housewife and/or earn significantly less). 


I don't nag, I just do what needs doing. I actually took off work yesterday and I spent 8 hours home alone, uninterrupted, doing deep Fall-time cleaning. The house was (almost) immaculate by the time everyone came home.


But because of the fact that mostly everything is done by me, I've adopted a philosophy of ""If it's solely up to me, then it gets done on my time. Otherwise, he's welcome to do it himself.""


He, however, does not like this! Because typically, that ends up inconveniencing him in some way. Like today, his shoes were thrown into the messy coat closet and now he's having to dig through the family's shoes to find his and it's making him really frustrated. I also do this, but it doesn't cause me to meltdown, it just is what it is until I organize the closet eventually, and again; if it bothers him so much, he's welcome to do it. (yeah, yeah, I know, in 8 hours I didn't get around to organizing the fridge, or the coat closet, and upon my 7th and final load of laundry, I went to bed instead of waiting for the dryer).


Today I tried something else. Today, he sent me a text about how he was so pissed off about having to dig through shoes to find his, and that the towels were in the dryer from the day before so he had to go all the way down there to get one before his shower, and the new bottle of coffee creamer was all the way in the back of the fridge and he had to move things, UGH! He was just set up for failure at every stop. The poor thing.

Okay Drama King, meet Drama Queen.

I texted him back the following:

**""Babe, I am so incredibly sorry that I forgot to bring the towels upstairs, and that your shoes were under the kids' shoes, and that the fridge is so disorganized. I should have just finished all of my chores yesterday instead of worrying about getting in bed to watch my show. That's totally on me and so unfair to you to have to deal with these things before work. I know that totally ruined your day. Again, I am so sorry. So I made a list, and from now on every morning before I leave for work, I'm going to make sure your clothes and shoes are set out for you, I'll make sure you have a clean and warm towel in the bathroom for you, and I'll make sure the creamer is immediately accessible. It's the least I can do. **

**Additionally, I'll even start taking the trash out in the morning before I leave, instead of waiting for you to do it when you get home from work. It really isn't fair you have to do things after working all day long, I'm sure that has to really suck for you. My goal is to make life as stress-free for you as possible, so if there is anything at all I can do to help make life all the more simpler for you, especially before I leave for work in the morning, just say the word.""**


He responds; *""You don't have to do all that, I don't want you a servant or whatever, I just don't want my mornings to be filled with obstacles. And I can (and should) help more.""*


Me: **""No honey, you get the kids on the bus 2 sometimes 3 times a week. That is more than enough. It's a big ask, I know it is. The least I can do on those mornings is make it as seamless as possible for you. Also, it seems like when you do help, you end up very frustrated with the way I've done things or something had been neglected (I'm lazy, I know, I have to work on that), I do not want to add any stress to your day. So in the future, if I do ask for help, I'll make sure it is a task and is simple and won't sour your mood. It's not fair for you to have to clean-up after me.""**


Him: *""Babe, I can't add more to your plate. That's unfair and I need to stop being lazy and actually help you with the house and kids.""*


.....Y'all I almost fell out. It worked. It actually worked. I was expecting him to be like ""okay, cut the shit, you don't have to be so sarcastic"" but instead he changed his attitude and admitted that it's unfair to *expect* everything to be flawless when he barely lifts a finger himself.
I'm taking this as a win.

1nrcuj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1nrcuj7/i_work_for_a_horror_movie_studio_i_just_read_a/,I Work for a Horror Movie Studio... I Just Read a Script Based on My Childhood Best Friend [Pt 1],"\[Hello everyone.  

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.   

TITLE: **ASILI**   

\[So, that was the cold open to *ASILI*, the screenplay you just read. If you happen to wonder why this opening takes place in prehistoric times, well here is why... What you just read was actually a dream sequence of Henry’s. You see, once Henry was in the jungle, he claimed to have these very lucid dreams of the jungle’s terrifying history – even as far back as prehistory... I know, pretty strange stuff. 

Make sure to tune in next week for the continuation of the story, where we’ll be introduced to our main characters before they answer the call to adventure. 

Thanks for reading everyone, and feel free to leave your thoughts and theories in the comments.

1nrcu6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/herbalism/comments/1nrcu6z/could_the_smells_we_crave_be_the_bodys_internal/,Could the smells we crave be the body’s internal compass?,"I stumbled on something interesting on a TCM blog the other day, and I can’t tell if it’s spot on or just poetic. It suggested that the scents we’re most drawn to aren’t just about taste or nostalgia, but could actually mirror the state of our body’s Qi.

Weirdly, it clicked for me—I’ve only recently started enjoying the smell of ginger, turmeric, cinnamon and coffee (never liked coffee growing up, honestly hated the smell in cafés). According to the blog, that might tie to Heart Qi weakness—stuff like cold hands, restless nights, circulation being a little off. The idea is that warm, spicy, roasted aromas like these can help lift the heart, move circulation, and bring a little internal warmth back, like a bit “liftng the heart.”

The blog laid out other parallels too: those with Liver Qi deficiency, for example, often crave the clean, green smells of pine or mint. People with sluggish digestion might be soothed by the sweetness of vanilla or the earthiness of patchouli. And those who are often under the weather might feel restored by crisp scents like citrus or white tea. Whether you take this literally or see it more as poetic metaphor, I find the framework intriguing, almost like your nose are already pointing us toward what we need IMO.

TLDR; I’m curious, have any of you noticed shifts in the smells you’re drawn to, and did it seem to track with what was going on in your body at the time? And if this rings true, do you think there’s a way to support that healing through herbs or nutrients, almost like following your own internal compass?",4,1758920329.0,herbalism,2,1.0,False

1nrcsve,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nrcsve/my_28m_initially_virtuallong_distance_gf_24m_of/,My (28M) initially virtual/long distance GF (24M) of 1.5 years just told me when we first met she perceived me as less masculine due to my height. How do I deal with this?,"We initially met online about 1.5 years ago, and our relationship was exclusively online/LDR for the first few months. For context, we met on a dating app, and she knew my height from the beginning. Another piece of context: she is 5'2 and I am 5'8. The first few months were great. We really bonded and grew to love each other. I eventually flew across the country to finally meet her. It was mostly great; we told each other ""I love you"" for the first time (despite knowing we were in love for a while at this point), went on several fun dates (coffee-shop, restaurants, farmers market, kayaking, etc), and I even met some of her family members and friends. 



However, towards the tail end of the visit, things went a bit south. She told me she felt unsure about everything, about us. She had a sort of emotional breakdown, telling me she felt like she was meeting a whole new person (I was understanding of this since this was the first time we were meeting in person), but she also said she was mad at me for not taking more initiative in regards to planning our dates/my visit. In between telling me she felt unsure, she kept saying she still loved me. She kept switching between being upset, telling me she's confused, telling me she's mad at me, telling me she loved me, hugging/kissing me, and crying. It was a complete emotional mess/breakdown. This was all very very confusing to me, and I felt blindsided. Unfortunately, I could not spend more time with her to hash things out because my flight was the next morning, so I left feeling incredibly hurt. 

We continued talking over the phone on my way back, and by the time I was home, she was profusely apologetic, saying she still wants me, she still loves me, that I'm the best man in the world to her, and she wants to marry me and spend the rest of our lives together. She said she just freaked out and had an emotional breakdown because she felt overwhelmed by the entire situation. Ultimately, I believed her, accepted her apology and promise to be better, and we moved on.

Our relationship progressed following this, mostly back to being LDR. However, I certainly felt like our dynamic was a little different. While most of the time, things were as great as ever, we would get into more arguments over trivial things. There were a couple of instances where she was not the most respectful to me, to say the least. She would apologize after every time, but again, things were different now compared to the first few months of our relationship before we had met. It was nothing huge, but I certainly missed how we were before. Things kind of felt perfect before. Maybe we were just in the honeymoon phase at the beginning so things were better then? Maybe this is normal in a relationship? I mean, every couple argues right? I wasn't sure, but I still loved her more than anyone I had loved before and she told me she loved and respected me more than she had loved or respected any other man in her life before, so I overlooked these things. 

Last week, we had a discussion, and she revealed to me that part of the real reason she had that emotional breakdown and felt unsure at our first meeting was because she expected me to be taller in person. Again, she knew my height from the first day we started talking (as a matter of fact, she had liked my dating profile first -- it had my height listed). She said that despite knowing my height, she didn't expect to care, but when we met in person for the first time, she saw it as less masculine. She said she was used to taller men, ""usually 5'10 to 6'0"" hitting on her. Men that ""towered over her"". She admitted that the real reason she freaked out and felt unsure during our first meeting was because of the height, and not because she felt overwhelmed by finally meeting in person. She admitted that the reason we have been getting into more arguments, and the reason that she has not had the same level of respect for me, is because she saw me as less masculine. But since then, her perspective has changed and now she doesn't care about that, and I'm the most amazing man in her life and she wants to spend the rest of our lives together. 



Now, I am not insecure about my height in the least. I don't think I'm even that short and I have never had any problems with women because of my height. I have always felt pretty close to average, so whatever. But I am very hurt right now because she perceived my height as less masculine, and obviously her ideal preference is for me to be taller. I can't change my height. Despite her telling me that she doesn't care about my height anymore, I don't know if I will ever forget that she felt that way. And part of me might always remember in the back of my mind that ideally she DOES prefer taller. And that she perceived me as less masculine at one point because of a feature of me that I can't change. 

Now, she is being profusely apologetic, saying she regrets even telling me about it. She has been trying to reassure me that she still loves me more than anyone, respects me more than anyone, and wants to spend the rest of our lives together. We had this conversation very recently, so the wounds are still fresh and I am still deeply hurt. I am wondering how/if I will ever get over this. Am I being dramatic about this? I still love her deeply and honestly want to get past this, as does she. ",2,1758920234.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

1nrcq56,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/1nrcq56/i_work_for_a_horror_movie_studio_i_just_read_a/,I Work for a Horror Movie Studio... I Just Read a Script Based on My Childhood Best Friend [Pt 1],"\[Hello everyone.  

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.   

TITLE: **ASILI**   

\[So, that was the cold open to *ASILI*, the screenplay you just read. If you happen to wonder why this opening takes place in prehistoric times, well here is why... What you just read was actually a dream sequence of Henry’s. You see, once Henry was in the jungle, he claimed to have these very lucid dreams of the jungle’s terrifying history – even as far back as prehistory... I know, pretty strange stuff. 

Make sure to tune in next week for the continuation of the story, where we’ll be introduced to our main characters before they answer the call to adventure. 

Thanks for reading everyone, and feel free to leave your thoughts and theories in the comments. 

Until next time, this is the OP,

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.

\[So, that was the cold open to *ASILI*, the screenplay you just read. If you happen to wonder why this opening takes place in prehistoric times, well here is why... What you just read was actually a dream sequence of Henry’s. You see, once Henry was in the jungle, he claimed to have these very lucid dreams of the jungle’s terrifying history – even as far back as prehistory... I know, pretty strange stuff. 

Make sure to tune in next week for the continuation of the story, where we’ll be introduced to our main characters before they answer the call to adventure. 

Thanks for reading everyone, and feel free to leave your thoughts and theories in the comments.

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.   

TITLE: **ASILI**   

\[So, that was the cold open to *ASILI*, the screenplay you just read. If you happen to wonder why this opening takes place in prehistoric times, well here is why... What you just read was actually a dream sequence of Henry’s. You see, once Henry was in the jungle, he claimed to have these very lucid dreams of the jungle’s terrifying history – even as far back as prehistory... I know, pretty strange stuff. 

Make sure to tune in next week for the continuation of the story, where we’ll be introduced to our main characters before they answer the call to adventure. 

Thanks for reading everyone, and feel free to leave your thoughts and theories in the comments.

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.

Working through some intolerances / allergistic reactions to (I think) strong citrus scents, chemicals/dyes and fragrances particularly in detergent in the past year.

Unfortunately these always manifest as a team without fail - very irritated/tired/ eyes with rings, sinus congestion and strong bottom of lung bronchoconstrictions. It’s a bit complicated as it seems to manifest as more of reactive airways versus asthma (for context, am 30 and have never been diagnosed with asthma and have no history of allergies. No acute sort of attacks touchwood)

Been prescribed Flonase and Airsupra. Taken two doses so far, of the Airsupra which I was only prescribed yesterday and it’s sort of helped but I don’t feel the “immediate” sort of relief the albuterol is meant to give. It helped a bit and breaths feel a bit easier but the baseline bottom lung tightness lingers. I understand that the Budenoside, the other ingredient, is meant to reduce the underlying inflammation and tightening. How long does this take to kick in?

Two other weird points: caffeine notably Celsiuses seem to help clear / loosen the lungs but I also wonder if they’re contributing, as I’ve on occasion felt a good hyper high but then a strong lung tightness from black coffee and tea.

And since I’m rambling on - if anyone has any tips on how to best deal with VOCs from detergents / the dryer and airway reactivity would be appreciated! Besides “avoid them” Which is the plan :)",1,1758919684.0,Allergies,0,1.0,False
1nrckoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nrckoj/should_i_meet_my_ex_for_closure_or_skip_it/,Should I meet my ex for closure or skip it?,"
Okay, so starting off by saying I know it’s probably not going to be the closure I want. My ex-boyfriend (20M) and I (20F) broke up in late June. Before we went no contact, we had agreed to meet at a coffee shop to just check in on each other and see how we’re both doing. However, it’s worth mentioning that after we broke up, there was a whole messy situation involving his parents.

His parents were twisting words clearly meant for me and saying it was never about me. Then, when he expressed wanting to work things through with me, his mom told him right before he left to come talk in person that even though it was “none of her business,” there were red flags with me that he shouldn’t ignore. After not being able to work through the issues — between the outside pressure of keeping his parents happy, managing his 3 jobs, being in a relationship, and still trying to make time for himself — we decided it would be best just to end things.

The problem came up when his parents refused to give back our shared pup, even though we had agreed she would go to me. This led to them trying to stop me from leaving, with his dad physically pinning me against my car. His dad, worth mentioning, is a sheriff, so whether or not this was just a habitual response he didn’t mean to establish, I can’t argue — but it scared me. When my ex pulled his dad off of me, his dad then turned around, grabbed his own son by the collar of his shirt, and shoved him against the car. After yelling in his face to “do something and be a man,” he got in his truck and sped away to avoid escalating things further. Meanwhile, his mom was calling me names the entire time I was locked out of my car (because at that point I realized my keys were inside).

This is why I don’t know if it would be reasonable to assume my ex will still show up. I don’t know if it’s relevant, but he is their only son. I don’t want to hurt myself and undo the progress I’ve made in healing by showing up and seeing him not show up the day of. At the same time, I don’t know if I want to see him show up and then have to ask for my stuff back.

I recently got a job at a ski resort in another state and am planning on leaving, but all of my snowboard gear — my board, boots, jackets, pants, everything — is still at his parents’ house from a snowboard trip we took the year before. I don’t want to make it into a huge deal, but I also don’t want to have to rebuy everything. Even secondhand, I’ve calculated the totals, and it’s not cheap.

So I guess what I’m asking here is:
	1.	Should I still show up for the possibility that he does?
	2.	How should I approach the situation with my stuff?
	3.	Should I just let it all go? 

——————————-

TL;DR: Ex and I planned a closure meetup for Oct 11. After the breakup, his parents got involved — his mom made comments about me, his dad (a sheriff) physically pinned me against my car (possibly a habitual reaction, but it scared me), then shoved his own son, and his mom insulted me while I was locked out with my keys inside. Now I don’t know if he’ll even show up. On top of that, all my snowboard gear is still at his parents’ house and would be expensive to replace. Should I go, try to ask for my stuff, or just let it go?

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.   

TITLE: **ASILI**   

\[So, that was the cold open to *ASILI*, the screenplay you just read. If you happen to wonder why this opening takes place in prehistoric times, well here is why... What you just read was actually a dream sequence of Henry’s. You see, once Henry was in the jungle, he claimed to have these very lucid dreams of the jungle’s terrifying history – even as far back as prehistory... I know, pretty strange stuff. 

Make sure to tune in next week for the continuation of the story, where we’ll be introduced to our main characters before they answer the call to adventure. 

Thanks for reading everyone, and feel free to leave your thoughts and theories in the comments.

Taken two doses so far, of the Airsupra which I was only prescribed yesterday and it’s sort of helped but I don’t feel the “immediate” sort of relief the albuterol is meant to give. It helped a bit and breaths feel a bit easier but the baseline bottom lung tightness lingers. I understand that the Budenoside, the other ingredient, is meant to reduce the underlying inflammation and tightening. How long does this take to kick in?

Two other weird points: caffeine notably Celsiuses seem to help clear / loosen the lungs but I also wonder if they’re contributing, as I’ve on occasion felt a good hyper high but then a strong lung tightness from black coffee and tea. 

And since I’m rambling on - if anyone has any tips on how to best deal with VOCs from detergents / the dryer and airway reactivity would be appreciated! Besides “avoid them”

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.   

TITLE: **ASILI**   

\[So, that was the cold open to *ASILI*, the screenplay you just read. If you happen to wonder why this opening takes place in prehistoric times, well here is why... What you just read was actually a dream sequence of Henry’s. You see, once Henry was in the jungle, he claimed to have these very lucid dreams of the jungle’s terrifying history – even as far back as prehistory... I know, pretty strange stuff. 

Make sure to tune in next week for the continuation of the story, where we’ll be introduced to our main characters before they answer the call to adventure. 

Thanks for reading everyone, and feel free to leave your thoughts and theories in the comments.

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.   

TITLE: **ASILI**   

\[So, that was the cold open to *ASILI*, the screenplay you just read. If you happen to wonder why this opening takes place in prehistoric times, well here is why... What you just read was actually a dream sequence of Henry’s. You see, once Henry was in the jungle, he claimed to have these very lucid dreams of the jungle’s terrifying history – even as far back as prehistory... I know, pretty strange stuff. 

Make sure to tune in next week for the continuation of the story, where we’ll be introduced to our main characters before they answer the call to adventure. 

Thanks for reading everyone, and feel free to leave your thoughts and theories in the comments.

Please be gentle 

Not sure why I’m even asking I already feel like one To clarify-by give up I absolutely do not mean the things I’m personally doing for them and my love for them.

My mother’s chemo therapy treatments for her cancer are very aggressive and she can end up in the A&E at times. For example yesterday was due to a strain to her heart.

My parents aren’t speaking at the moment(married for 20 years) due to an argument they had so she was alone. I went to visit her after school and brought her some essentials  and stayed with her until she was admitted, so I had to book an uber back at like 11am. My dad drove some of my siblings whilst I took a train directly from school but refused to visit her because she didn’t tell him she was at the hospital.

About last week I was in trouble over something minor  and that started off an argument which lead to another. Eventually they almost physically fought, my mother threw a water bottle at him and my dad threatened to pour his coffee on her.

On top of my mother’s cancer my dad has a heart condition with an artificial pacemaker. THEY DONT NEED THIS. And what makes it worse. I’m the mediator.

Not to toot my own horn but I would consider myself the most emotionally intelligent out of my 3 siblings,,, my older brother doesn’t take the initiative to visit my mother and my two younger siblings (one is a year younger than me) are just by default less aware.

As a result my dad vents to me about my mother and all the bad things she does that he hates and how he doesn’t have anybody to talk to. (I think he uses me as a result) My mother calls my dad a waste of space to me.

I’m honestly so alone my mother is so sick, she deserves somebody to take care of her (like my dad) as we are a small family.

However my dad is completely ignoring her. Just to add my dad is a good person but he has his reasons to clash with my mother however the timing is terrible.

They are both in the wrong. I’m trying to get them to communicate as to be honest their relationship has never been terrible they’ve never argued much but now my dad tells me they argue because of me/us. And how when I misbehave it causes conflict because my mother’s temper is really short.

I haven’t slept much at all for 2 days straight since my mother has been admitted and her lack of support on top of that is absolutely breaking my heart.

I’m trying my best on top of school and my own mental health struggles.

I’m supposed to be starting therapy soon because of my depression however it’s selfish to sneak around for therapy whilst somebody needs me most.

It’s getting harder to focus during school and my anxiety is through the roof .

A local mechanic repaired the boost pipe between the turbo and the engine; sits behind and below the block itself. It then threw up a DTF/soot filter fault, and I got it remapped to remove it by a different guy.

It's going in to a 3rd garage next week to have the DTF physically removed and to check the earlier boost pipe repair (which I was told had to be improvised and now suspect was not a success). I also replaced the plastic linkage for the swirl flap actuator, which had gone AWOL (£6.36 from the main dealer AND they gave me a coffee, bless 'em).

I have ""grand"" ambitions that come next week, it might be able to do, y'know, motorway speeds. If anyone has any other tips of things to look out for in respect of this boost/limp issue, I'd love to hear them. Thanks!",1,1758919538.0,VolvoXC90,0,1.0,False

Anyway, that got me thinking about what of the blackout was longer than a couple of hours. We had an old Coleman Gas Stove in the barn that I hadn't touched in probably 25 years. It didn't want to work so I checked out some Youtube videos on restoring them. I also had a lantern so I figured I would work on that too. 

It didn't take too much effort to get them operational again. Something I learned from Youtube is that they are multifuel and will run on ethanol free gasoline and kerosene. 

Years ago someone hired me to help them clean out a vacant apartment and the the stove and lantern were left behind so I got them for free. People practically give these away at yard sales and flea markets. ",11,1758919516.0,prepping,2,1.0,False

I'm at the train stop, meet a gen zer cleaning out the bins - we have eye contact and do a quick nod, acknowledging the unfairness of the situation. 

We are riding on the same train, we ignore each other but seek each others company nevertheless and sit in the same cubicle. I'm in the waiting room and give the coming in, very lost looking gen zer a heads up on where to pull the number.

This summer my cat almost died of a heat stroke on the way to the vet, the café i stopped for help had people my age working, i had never gotten wet towels and ice and water so fast, no questions asked, even got to see the cooling chamber. Or when I was pepper sprayed in a situation i will not go into further, the nurse working the shift at the hospital, i stumbled into, washed out my eyes without even looking at my insurance card and gave me more of the fluid for to go.

Our contact just feels so respectful and reasonable, compared with the antics one would have with at least 50% of the people of older generations.

I love it, it feels like i'm never alone anywhere, as i know i'll always meet one of us and we have each others back always, when shit goes down. its like we are all fighting this apocalypse together.

1nrchxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturesTemper/comments/1nrchxi/i_work_for_a_horror_movie_studio_i_just_read_a/,I Work for a Horror Movie Studio... I Just Read a Script Based on My Childhood Best Friend [Pt 1],"\[Hello everyone.  

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.

I’ll be driving up by myself for the weekend. The main reason I’m going is to take a break from city life, enjoy the scenery, and do some chill hikes. Nothing too extreme, just something relaxing where I can recharge and take in the views.

Since I’m going solo, I’m a little worried it might feel isolating, so I’d also love to know if there are ways to join activities or meet people casually while I’m there. For example:

* Any hiking groups or guided hikes that are open to solo travelers?
* Local events or festivals (Oktoberfest, farmers markets, outdoor music, etc.) happening in early October?
* Good spots like breweries, wine bars, or coffee shops where it’s easy to meet other visitors or locals?

For context, I’m in my early 30s, so I’m not really looking for loud college type bars that are mostly early 20s and packed, just not my vibe.

I’ve heard Eagle Lake and Rubicon Trail are beautiful, and I might try paddleboarding or kayaking if the weather is still good. But since this will be my first trip to Tahoe, I’d also love to hear about other fun things to do or unique experiences beyond hiking. Just anything you think a first timer shouldn’t miss.

And lastly, are there any tips or things I should watch out for when visiting Tahoe for the first time? (traffic, parking, weather, best areas to stay, etc.)

Thanks everyone!",4,1758919392.0,bayarea,3,1.0,False

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.   

TITLE: **ASILI**   

\[So, that was the cold open to *ASILI*, the screenplay you just read. If you happen to wonder why this opening takes place in prehistoric times, well here is why... What you just read was actually a dream sequence of Henry’s. You see, once Henry was in the jungle, he claimed to have these very lucid dreams of the jungle’s terrifying history – even as far back as prehistory... I know, pretty strange stuff. 

Make sure to tune in next week for the continuation of the story, where we’ll be introduced to our main characters before they answer the call to adventure. 

Thanks for reading everyone, and feel free to leave your thoughts and theories in the comments.

Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.   

TITLE: **ASILI**   

\[So, that was the cold open to *ASILI*, the screenplay you just read. If you happen to wonder why this opening takes place in prehistoric times, well here is why... What you just read was actually a dream sequence of Henry’s. You see, once Henry was in the jungle, he claimed to have these very lucid dreams of the jungle’s terrifying history – even as far back as prehistory... I know, pretty strange stuff. 

Make sure to tune in next week for the continuation of the story, where we’ll be introduced to our main characters before they answer the call to adventure.

Coincidence? I don’t think so. 

The first interview with atrioc and Gavin Newsom was on the 22nd of May and his favorability has pretty much been on an up since. 

The Coffee cow has a obviously has a huge national impact and is the sole reason for the upswing. 

So my logical conclusion is that, if Gavin Newsom wanted to become president. He’d have to record regular Hitman and Age of Empire videos in the next years to reach a favorability rating of 100% and become the next president with ease.

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*...

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.   

TITLE: **ASILI**   

\[So, that was the cold open to *ASILI*, the screenplay you just read. If you happen to wonder why this opening takes place in prehistoric times, well here is why... What you just read was actually a dream sequence of Henry’s. You see, once Henry was in the jungle, he claimed to have these very lucid dreams of the jungle’s terrifying history – even as far back as prehistory... I know, pretty strange stuff. 

Make sure to tune in next week for the continuation of the story, where we’ll be introduced to our main characters before they answer the call to adventure.

First and foremost, I’m not replacing anyone I’m currently writing with! I just have more time between work than I thought, and I’m looking for (hopefully) one or two long-term writers to fill the space! (I don’t have the mental capacity for more, sorry.)

&nbsp;

I’m 32, my timezone is BST (it’s late, but that’s when I’m at my best apparently) and i’ve been writing for about fifteen years on and off. I primarily use Discord to write and I strictly write in third person and past tense. (I’m really sorry, self inserts and first person give me the actual ick.) I’d prefer if no one under the age of 25 reached out, thank you! All I ask is for you to **actually** be communicative, if you lose interest, have an idea, want to change things— any of your basic human rights, just let me know! I won’t bite your head off. Please include the word: Eastward somewhere in your message so I know you’re actually reading this. No word, no reply. And if you have literally no effort in how you write even in your opening, expect no response too. You don’t have to be literate, but I would consider myself so!

&nbsp;

I have a couple of prompts that have been floating around my head for a while, and I’m hoping there’s someone out there who wants to try one! Or maybe a few if we get on well enough. I’d love to hear your ideas too, if you have them! This would be best as a 50/50 effort, I don’t want to do all the heavy lifting for us and I’d hope I’m not making you do that either! Speaking of, we don’t have to be friends outside of the story but it is welcomed— provided it’s not creepy. I won’t be sharing any personal info, but I’m more than happy to talk about our characters until the cows come home!


Adult themes are welcome, but we can discuss further in our chat!


&nbsp;

As for the ideas:

&nbsp;

    •    Nurse & Soldier (40s/50s) — Muse A is a nurse who volunteers at a small-town clinic. Muse B’s newly arrived in town, recovering from a fainting spell at work. A first meets B when B insists he’s fine, clearly embarrassed by the fuss—but she sees right through his stubborn charm. He returns to the clinic more than once, not because he needs to, but because he’s drawn to her warmth and quiet steadiness. Their story becomes one of him learning to slow down and her finding someone who makes her feel cared for too.

&nbsp;

    •    The Wandering Healer & The Cursed Traveler (Fantasy) — Muse A a wandering healer who sets up a stall in busy marketplaces, trading remedies for coins. Muse B comes to her with a strange illness—though in truth, it’s a curse he can’t explain. Drawn into his mystery, she offers her help, and they find themselves traveling together in search of the cure. On the road, they go from strangers bound by necessity to companions bound by trust… and eventually, something gentler and deeper.

&nbsp;

    •    The Bookshop Keeper & The Forgotten Knight (Urban Fantasy) — Muse A runs a small secondhand bookstore with a knack for finding unusual titles. One rainy evening, Muse B stumbles in—dazed, confused, and wearing clothes that seem centuries out of place. He remembers nothing except his name and the faint impression of a promise he once made. She gives him shelter, and as they work to piece together his past, she finds herself falling for the man who feels both completely out of time and inexplicably right at her side

&nbsp;

    •    The Florist & The Sleepless Stranger (Modern) — Muse A owns a flower shop on a quiet street, opening early in the morning. Muse B walks past every day before dawn, always looking a little tired, coffee in hand, heading to his demanding job. One morning, he finally stops—asks about the flowers she’s setting out, awkward but sincere. He starts showing up more often, using excuses to buy bouquets he doesn’t really need, until she realises he’s slowly filling his lonely apartment with color just to see her smile. 

If any of those sound good or you think we’d be a good fit regardless, shoot me a DM— absolutely nothing is set in stone, those are just some ballpark ideas I have. I’d be more than happy to hear anything you’ve been dying to try too! I’m looking forward to hearing from you. Have a good evening either way!",3,1758919176.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,1,1.0,False

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.   

TITLE: **ASILI**   

\[So, that was the cold open to *ASILI*, the screenplay you just read. If you happen to wonder why this opening takes place in prehistoric times, well here is why... What you just read was actually a dream sequence of Henry’s. You see, once Henry was in the jungle, he claimed to have these very lucid dreams of the jungle’s terrifying history – even as far back as prehistory... I know, pretty strange stuff. 

Make sure to tune in next week for the continuation of the story, where we’ll be introduced to our main characters before they answer the call to adventure. 

Thanks for reading everyone, and feel free to leave your thoughts and theories in the comments.

1nrcanw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mafia/comments/1nrcanw/bio_on_suspected_chicago_outfit_member_robert/,Bio on suspected Chicago Outfit member Robert Panozzo,"[01\/07\/2019](https://preview.redd.it/2zmm27nvkkrf1.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=faf766793c3b4b05363802c2d8f47db090baf73e)

Note: Those interested in a general overview of the P-K Crew can watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJpXPfmSlp8) by The Sitdown.

Robert William Panozzo (Panozzo Sr.) is a suspected member of the Chicago family.

Born March 1^(st) 1960 in Chicago to Louis Panozzo and Patricia May Hendee. Father’s family possibly identical to individuals hailing from Treschè Conca frazione located in the Roana comune of Vicenza, Veneto.

Grew up around Grand and Ogden, near or in The Patch neighbourhood.

Probably affiliated with the C-Notes by the mid-to-late 1970s, alongside close associate Paul Koroluk Sr.

Future Chicago member Albert Vena was also a C-Note and probably introduced Panozzo to the Grand Avenue crew. Another C-Note and Vena associate was Charles “Chuckie” Russell (1949-2017).  

Married to Maryann LNU (Washington?) by the early 1980s. Their son, Robert Jerry Panozzo (Panozzo Jr.) is also a Grand Avenue affiliate and possible modern C-Note leadership figure.

By this point, involved in drug operations, burglaries and other street activities.

Alleged to have murdered Lydia Minnici in late 1987. She died December 17^(th) 1987 of apparent heart failure at her home.

One account from cooperator and former P-K crew member Jeffrey Hollingshead (alt. Hollinghead) claims that Panozzo had repeatedly thrown Minnici down a flight of stairs.

Motive appears to be related to property rights for Minnici’s apartment. She had signed the deed over to Panozzo associate Steven Brantner on October 19^(th) 1987.

Brantner was fatally shot on October 14^(th) 1991 at 2035 W. Ohio in The Patch. Panozzo discovered the body and brought Brantner to a hospital.

On November 13^(th) 1992, Chicago member Joseph “Lumpy” Lombardo was released on federal parole from FCI McKean. He was possibly on the shelf.

An FBI membership list for November 1993 lists Lombardo as a captain but other sources suggest that Anthony Centracchio was instead the Grand Avenue leader. He is also identified as a captain on the 1993 list.  

*The In$ane Chicago Way* identifies that around this time Lombardo and an unspecified Chicago member were involved in efforts to coordinate the Insane Family faction of the Latin Folks Spanish Growth and Development (SGD) syndicate.

[Lombardo](https://preview.redd.it/090zf9swkkrf1.png?width=263&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7c680a0e30a26f7d244d79a67edaa946c09e44)

The Outfit’s primary connection into the SGD constitution was through members of the C-Notes, though neither Panozzo nor Koroluk are not mentioned in this regard.

Other notable Latin Folks gangs in the Insane Family faction include the Spanish Cobras and Latin Dragons.

Panozzo was possibly associated to Albert Vena, suspected of membership by this time. He had also been active as a collector for Joey Lombardo.  

In August 1993, a building owned by Louis and Patricia Panozzo (parents) was sold to a Bill Zada. He resold it to a trust where it was later purchased by Frank P. Cangelosi.

BDSM dungeon Chicago Illusions has operated at the location from around August 1992 and may be affiliated with the Cicero crew.

Indicted in 2000 on weapon charges and received 2 years of probation.

Chicago captain (?) Anthony Centracchio on died August 6^(th) 2001 while awaiting trial.

It remains unclear who was subsequently elevated between Albert Vena and suspected member James Cozzo or if Centracchio had only been in an acting position for Joey Lombardo.

Possible Chicago members by the early-to-mid 2000s include Dino Marino, Anthony Nicholas Calabrese, Christopher Spina, Anthony Dote, Gary Gagliano as well as others. Robert Panozzo Sr. may be part of this group.

Involved in a loansharking operation by 2005, utilising Joseph Abbott as a collector. One debtor borrowed 100,000 dollars from Panozzo.

Former captain (?) Joey Lombardo was indicted on April 25^(th) 2005 as a result of *Operation Family Secrets*. Also named was Chicago family boss James Marcello.

Participated in a burglary with Paul Koroluk Sr. and associate Brian David in December 2005. The group had targeted a home in Morton Grove.

Investigators were able to track evidence that confirmed Koroluk’s involvement. He was arrested with Panozzo and David later that month.

On October 5^(th) 2006, Panozzo, Joseph Abbott and an unsub gave a severe beating to their loansharking debtor at his business over slow repayment.

Pled guilty to the residential burglary charges along with Koroluk on October 30^(th) 2006 and received a 7-year sentence.

[Koroluk Sr. \(IDOC\)](https://preview.redd.it/b3b4pd7zkkrf1.png?width=208&format=png&auto=webp&s=30657210444680a13f0f7e20e3f7cdb2ff69b5fd)

Both Koroluk and Panozzo were in IDOC custody by November 3^(rd) 2006. Panozzo was released on parole on September 25^(th) 2008.

Around February 2009, Panozzo instructed Abbott to set the loanshark victim’s vehicle on fire. Subsequent demands for repayment saw Abbott firebomb the victim’s home on April 8^(th) 2009.

In October 2009, Jeffrey Hollingshead, Kevin Koonce, Donald Hines and Curtis Sanders attempted to kidnap and ransom a wheelchair-bound street gang member. The FBI and Chicago PD were able to coordinate a sting and captured Hollingshead attempting to retrieve the ransom drop.

He was released on bond, pending trial.

Associate Paul Koroluk Sr. was paroled on March 24^(th) 2010 from IDOC Illinois River CC.  

Grand Avenue affiliate Norberto Vélez was murdered on November 25^(th) 2010 in his West Addison apartment building. He was apparently a neighbour of Jeffrey Hollingshead and his death may have stemmed from activities connected to Robert Panozzo and Albert Vena.

By February 2011, the P-K Crew was engaged in a series of burglaries throughout DuPage County. Active in this group were Louis Capuzi Jr., Brian David, Richard Green, C-Note Paul Koroluk Jr. and Frank Obrochta.  

The following year (at the latest), the P-K Crew had begun a series of well-organised armed robberies and home invasions. Apart from Panozzo, those involved in the drug rip offs included;

Robert Panozzo Jr., Paul Koroluk Sr., Dionisio ""Junebug"" Garcia, Jeffrey Hollingshead and Maher “Max” Abuhabsah, a possible member of the Spanish Cobras.

William Feliciano would supply stolen vehicles to the crew and Jose Contreras (also possibly a Spanish Cobra) would act as a lookout during robberies and also redistributed stolen narcotics.

[Contreras & Feliciano](https://preview.redd.it/6yh4rb70lkrf1.png?width=584&format=png&auto=webp&s=35973ab3d565fa49b06e53387af7945a22731ed2)

Members of the Spanish Cobras and Latin Dragons would identify cocaine, marijuana and heroin dealers for Panozzo. Specific care was given to ensure that these were independent operations and not associated with any major drug cartels.

Posing as police officers, the P-K group would commit around 5 or 6 robberies and home invasions a year, in addition to other burglaries.

Around summer 2012, Outfit affiliate and FBI informant George Michael was contacted over issues connected to the Polekatz strip club by the widow of its former owner.

The business was being extorted by Elmwood Park crew associates Anthony Quaranta and Demitri Stavropoulos, who were attempting to gain ownership.

In July 2012, Michael met with probable Grand Avenue captain Albert Vena at the La Scarola restaurant over the Polekatz issue. Also in attendance were Robert Panozzo and Chicago associates Michael Swiatek and Steven Mandell (nee Manning).

Mandell subsequently became involved in the Polekatz dispute.

One telephone call recorded between Mandell and Michael on September 20^(th) 2012 referenced a conversation between Mandell and Panozzo over meetings between Quaranta and Stavropoulos at Armand’s Pizzeria on Grand Avenue.

Further involvement from Panozzo in the Polekatz dispute remains unclear.  

On November 15^(th) 2012, the P-K Crew committed a residential burglary at 3535 E. Goodenow in Will County and stole cocaine from the location. Participants identified as Panozzo, Paul Koroluk Sr., Max Abuhabsah, Jeff Hollingshead and an unsub.

By this point, involved with a prostitution business at the 800 block of West Superior Street. The operation was fronted as a massage parlour.

[2014](https://preview.redd.it/sba876d1lkrf1.png?width=208&format=png&auto=webp&s=583c3f2b062ca79ecfa1ed1662d7cfbe425e33aa)

Took part in a home invasion at 1914 S. 55th Ct. in Cicero on April 16^(th) 2013.

Other participants noted as Koroluk, Abuhabsah, Hollingshead, Dionisio Garcia and an unsub. Some of the group went in the front as police officers while the remainder forced entry through a rear door.

Two vehicles and cocaine (amount unclear) were grabbed by the crew.  

At some point in spring 2013, Panozzo, Koroluk, Hollingshead and an unsub participated in a home invasion where two vehicles and a significant amount of cocaine were stolen.

During the robbery, Panozzo became incensed and sliced off one victim’s ear after he had claimed to only speak Spanish but later said something in English.

Note: the similarities between these incidents from CI accounts may indicate it was a single episode.

In either July or August 2013, Hollingshead met with attorney Joseph “The Shark” Lopez at the Caribou Coffee shop at 1328 S. Halsted Street.

Lopez was representing Hollingshead and provided documentation (including an address) on the victim in his October 2009 kidnapping case. Lopez instructed Hollingshead to pass the information to Panozzo, implying that he would murder the individual.

Hollingshead was subsequently arrested on home invasion and firearm charges on October 18^(th) 2013. On October 21^(st), Hollingshead met with CPD detectives. He was seeking consideration for a reduced sentence for his October 2009 kidnapping charges and began cooperating.

Hollingshead advised that he had known Panozzo since around 2007 and that from his perspective, Panozzo “represented himself as a made man with the Chicago Outfit.”

As a result of Hollingshead and apparently another unidentified P-K Crew cooperator, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office began investigations into the group under *Operation Crew Cut* in late October 2013.

After learning of Hollingshead’s cooperation at an unspecified later date, Panozzo and Koroluk Sr. claimed to an informant that they were able to arrange Hollingshead’s transfer to a division of Cook County Jail where he could be murdered. Veracity of this threat unclear.   

In November 2013, Panozzo, Koroluk, Dionisio Garcia and Max Abuhabsah committed a residential burglary at an apartment in Harwood Heights, Cook County. A minor amount of marijuana was stolen from the residence.

CPD detectives interviewed another unidentified P-K Crew member in late February 2014. Source relayed that Dionisio Garcia was involved in kidnappings and admitted to involvement with burglaries alongside Panozzo and Koroluk.

Panozzo was surveilled through May 2014 by the CPD at various properties connected to P-K Crew activities.

In June 2014, two cooperating witnesses were instructed by law enforcement to make contact with Max Abuhabsah and provide information on a cocaine burglary set up by authorities.

In his communications with the informants, Abuhabsah stated that delays in P-K operations were because two of their “white boys” (Hollingshead and Kevin Koonce?) were incarcerated.

[Koonce \(02\/12\/2014\)](https://preview.redd.it/zuu6hx33lkrf1.png?width=296&format=png&auto=webp&s=3572e9585c2991b0d52441fc6de28503600203ae)

By early July 2014, Abuhabsah had arranged a robbery job at the sting’s location. The home had been wired for sound and video with an FBI aircraft detail also performing surveillance of the neighbourhood.  

On July 16^(th) 2014, Panozzo, Robert Panozzo Jr., Paul Koroluk and Max Abuhabsah participated in a burglary at 13451 S. Brandon Avenue in Cook County. Koroluk and Panozzo posed as police officers while Panozzo Jr. and Abuhabsah conducted countersurveillance in vehicles around the area.

After they had grabbed the planted cocaine, FBI and CPD arrested all those present.

The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office charged Panozzo, Panozzo Jr., Koroluk Sr. and Abuhabsah with Super Class X felonies on July 19^(th) 2014.

A chart depicting the P-K Crew around that time is available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mafia/comments/1ieo53x/pk_crew_chart/).

Indicted in April 2014 on federal extortion charges in connection to his 2000s loansharking ring. Collector Joseph Abbott briefly attempted to cooperate but refused to testify in 2016.

Panozzo remained in state custody until a plea deal in January 2019. Received an 18-year sentence, with credit for time served in Cook County jail that same month.

Admitted to IDOC custody on January 7^(th) 2019 at Stateville CC.

Pled guilty to federal charges on June 19^(th) 2019. Received a 14-year sentence that September, to be run concurrently with state charges.

Chicago member and former Grand Avenue captain Joseph Lombardo died October 19^(th) 2019 while serving a life sentence at ADX Florence.

Paroled from IDOC Pinckneyville CC into federal custody on October 5^(th) 2022. Incarcerated at various times with the BOP at FCI Manchester, FCI Hazelton and FCI Oxford.

Presently incarcerated at FMC Lexington, release date listed as June 20^(th) 2029.

1nrc9h7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nrc9h7,Update: Two months into living on my bike,"At the start of August, I finally took the leap to live on my bike. I sold off a lot of my belongings and rolled out of Bolzano (IT) with no fixed plan or destination, just a rough idea to explore intentional communities, help out on social-agricultural projects, and give more space to my spiritual practice. So far, the route has taken me through the Dolomites, Slovenia, and down the full length of the Croatian coast.

This is my first trip longer than four days on a bike, though I had some wild camping and backpacking experience to lean on. My setup is definitely on the heavier side compared to what I usually see here, but for me it’s less about going fast and more about living comfortably along the way. Half biking, half living, you could say. I even carry a small woodworking kit to make gifts for people I meet, and a hand grinder so I can brew fresh coffee for hosts or fellow travelers.

My Surly Ogre has been a dream, capable of handling everything I’ve thrown at it so far. From rocky downhills or long stretches of asphalt, to steep climbs. I’ve been surprised how quickly my body adapted to the weight. On flat days I might roll 100k, while in the mountains it’s more like 50–90k, but distance isn’t really the goal. What keeps me going are the unexpected encounters, the views I didn’t plan for, and the doors this way of traveling seems to open.

When I was preparing, I struggled to find many examples of people mixing bikepacking with a more nomadic, slow-living approach. A lot of what I read was focused on being ultralight. That works great for some, but I’ve found carrying a bit of extra comfort has been worth it for me. I guess what I’m learning is that there are many different ways to do this, and the right one is simply the one that matches the kind of experience you want to have.

Sleeping outside most nights has become second nature, and honestly, I’ve never felt unsafe. Life feels incredibly simple right now, and I’m reminded daily how far a little trust and kindness can go. I haven’t spent anything on accommodation so far, though there have been plenty of nights under a real roof thanks to the generosity of people I’ve met.

With winter coming, I’ll probably pause in a community somewhere through Workaway, and from there, dream up what’s next. Right now I’m feeling inspired enough that I’m considering a much longer trip towards Asia in spring.

If anyone wants to follow along, I’m sharing my route and updates here:

I’m looking for someone to takeover my lease  after this semester ends so around December-January ish time just because i’m planning on moving out of Las Vegas. It’s a 4 bed, 4 bath and you would have a standard room, base rent is $815 + utilities.

The apartment is right next to the UNLV campus so if you’re a student you can easily walk/scooter to your class in minutes, the living area and rooms are a bit smaller than other complexes in the area such as the degree or the you, but I personally don’t mind because it’s significantly cheaper than the other options and has just about all the same essentials you’d need. I personally enjoy living here and wouldn’t hesitate to renew the lease if I wasn’t moving away. 

The amenities are really nice, the apartment has a swimming pool, game room, movie room, coffee lounge, and more. 

I believe you can do a full virtual tour of the facility on their website if you want to get a feel of what it looks like to live here.

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.

I've been underemployed for a couple years ever since a mass layoff. I took one of those programs to help you find your next job, and of course took the advice of every consistently employed person in my life. Universally, the advice was to use my existing professional connections. No problem, I always had very positive performance reviews. In fact, I was an 8-week temp that got hired on for 4 years before the company went under.

Problem is, every person I reached out to either left me on read or said ""Yeah, would love to help!"" and simply didn't. My girlfriend, who I'd recently moved in with, could not understand why this was happening when people were always trying to hire her when she lost a job. My best guess is that she has worked 15 years in one field, whereas my resume was a few years in a number of disconnected industries. Anyway, she left me because I never heard back from companies, which she took to mean I wasn't applying enough.

I tried to think outside the box. My local elevator repair union advertised a 5-year internship, no prior experience needed. ""We have trained schoolteachers"", it said on the website. My background is largely in education. I got CPR certified and did OSHA training to bolster my application. I took the elevator repair union's standardized test and got a literal 100%. This landed me an ""interview"", which was extremely structured and un-conversational. You would answer a question printed in a book, turn the page, answer the next. They asked me what my training with tools was. I said none, but I would use the 5 years studiously. The interviewers were visibly alarmed, and I did not get the job.

So I gave up on finding a job and headed to post-graduate study in a field with robust work opportunities. Now I'm slowly bleeding my savings and back to applying for coffee and bookstore jobs that are never actually open.

I've re-entered the dating pool and found that my professional struggles make me unappealing to many women. Some are direct and say they want someone at the same step in life as them; I appreciate these responses. Some are way more direct and call me a bum and a loser, often before we have even met. I feel like I am not my own person and instead I am just an avatar for every man who has ever wronged them.

So I've just stopped trying for these things. Trying for things makes me feel like a huge annoyance to people. Now, instead of asking businesses for an application, or instead of trying to find love, I live a life of relative contentment based around seeing movies, going to museums, and taking 10-mile walks listening to audiobooks.

It's nice, but I miss the things I once had. I miss my job stability and, even though my ex-girlfriend did not believe in me and I know we are better apart, I loved her dearly. I feel like I loved her for her flaws, not despite them. I loved her complexities. She looked at my flaws and hated me for them.

I wonder if this an okay way to live. Not happy, but baseline feeling positive. Not trying in love, not trying in the job search. Sitting in beautiful parks reading books. But also feeling too fragile, like the unrelenting rejection of modern life is too much for me.",1,1758918808.0,self,0,1.0,False

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.

My parents aren’t speaking at the moment(married for 20 years) due to an argument they had so she was alone. I went to visit her after school and brought her some essentials  and stayed with her until she was admitted, so I had to book an uber back at like 11am. My dad drove some of my siblings whilst I took a train directly from school but refused to visit her because she didn’t tell him she was at the hospital.

About last week I was in trouble over something minor  and that started off an argument which lead to another. Eventually they almost physically fought, my mother threw a water bottle at him and my dad threatened to pour his coffee on her.

On top of my mother’s cancer my dad has a heart condition with an artificial pacemaker. THEY DONT NEED THIS. And what makes it worse. I’m the mediator. 


Not to toot my own horn but I would consider myself the most emotionally intelligent out of my 3 siblings,,, my older brother doesn’t take the initiative to visit my mother and my two younger siblings (one is a year younger than me) are just by default less aware. 


As a result my dad vents to me about my mother and all the bad things she does that he hates and how he doesn’t have anybody to talk to. 
(I think he uses me as a result) My mother calls my dad a waste of space to me. 

I’m honestly so alone my mother is so sick, she deserves somebody to take care of her (like my dad) as we are a small family. 

However my dad is completely ignoring her. Just to add my dad is a good person but he has his reasons to clash with my mother however the timing is terrible.

They are both in the wrong. I’m trying to get them to communicate as to be honest their relationship has never been terrible they’ve never argued much but now my dad tells me they argue because of me/us. And how when I misbehave it causes conflict because my mother’s temper is really short.

I haven’t slept much at all for 2 days straight since my mother has been admitted and her lack of support on top of that is absolutely breaking my heart. 

I’m trying my best on top of school and my own mental health struggles. 

I’m supposed to be starting therapy soon because of my depression however it’s selfish to sneak around for therapy whilst somebody needs me most. 

It’s getting harder to focus during school and my anxiety is through the roof .

SO SORRX FOR ALL THE WORDS

There’s an “inclusive” coffee shop in Fredericksburg that is allowing their sound engineer to be creepy with patrons. The co-owners were spoken to several weeks ago about this issue. They’ve since stated they’ve heard no complaints about this individual. 

The sound engineer uses open mic nights to corner female customers to “talk.” He will dm them on Instagram once they’ve left to insist on them “hanging out.” Females have noted having to contact others in the business on open mic nights to get away from this host. 

Although the co-owners mention repeatedly that they have a mission to be a safe space for all, they do not seem to take any claims seriously. 

They told the host about who had made statements and allowed him to contact them individually. They’ve shunned those who’ve spoken up. They’ve continued to say they do not have enough evidence to take any action. 

Although they claim safety, alerting this host about the individuals making claim puts them at significant risk. These risks have been stated to one of the owners who refuses to point a direction into who exposed those who accused the host. 

The co-owners appear to intend on waiting until something far more serious happens in order to take any action. Even choosing to allow this individual to go without a proper boundaries conversation can lead to more happening.

The businesses location, influx of young people, and ethics behind providing an ear to any issue should raise alarms for anyone in the area. 

You are not safe in this “safe space.”

If you have been placed in harms way by this staffer, the owners did ask that you email/ dm on instagram/ pass the in store owner a “note of complaint.” There’s no telling if they’ll take it seriously but they’d like to document it.",19,1758918330.0,fredericksburg,9,0.79,False

i.

I am nine, sneaking into your bedroom  
as soon as you’re out of the house.  
You have avocado green walls plastered  
with boyband posters and  
magazine clippings,  
the epitome of pre-teen cool.

I thumb through the books on your shelf,  
fingers softly stroking their spines,  
and set one aside to smuggle  
back to my room, where I’ll read it  
as fast as I can, before you notice it’s gone.

I spray your perfume on my wrists  
and try on your favourite sweater  
and hold your hoops up to my face  
in your mirror.

I am an anthropologist,  
studying the secret world of Alex,  
deciphering your language through  
photo strips and mix CDs, track lists  
scrawled out in sparkly gel pen.

Or I am a parishioner,  
kneeling down at your altar and  
taking Communion in the form of  
cherry lip gloss and body glitter.

Soon you’ll come home and see  
something out of place,  
and you’ll scream at me to get  
my own books and  
my own taste and  
my own life.

But I have never known life  
without you;  
there has never existed a version  
of me not shaped by you.

This is sisterhood.

ii.

I am thirteen, in the passenger seat  
of your ’96 Intrepid.  
It’s a boat on wheels with scuffed  
red paint and the check engine light  
stuck on.

You like me more now that  
I’m a little older,  
or at least you’ve stopped  
resenting me for revoking  
your only-child status.

I helped you pick out the car,  
spotted the for-sale sign parked  
on a neighbour’s boulevard,  
and we joked about how many bodies  
you could fit in the trunk.

It’s a late night in late July, and we’re  
driving through the swampy heat  
with the windows cranked down ‘cause  
you’ve got no AC.

We’re on the hunt for magic roads—  
roads with no traffic and that  
curve just right,  
that make us feel weightless  
as we go around the bends—

roads that are infinite and liminal,  
a transition strip between here and  
something greater,  
roads that make us believe something greater  
might exist.

We’ve got the radio up as high as it goes,  
screaming along to the indie rock  
rolling in from Toronto.  
I scribble lyrics down onto a napkin  
from the songs we don’t know so we can  
look them up when we get home.

Amber streetlight floods in and casts  
your features in harsh relief,  
an outline of nose and brow that I recognize  
in my own reflection off the windshield.

You make me hold my breath on  
left turns and make a wish as we pass  
under the train bridge, but we get  
caught at the next crossing anyways.

We’re laughing as we stumble inside  
past curfew, trying to be quiet so we don’t  
wake up Mom, but that just makes us  
laugh harder.

I’ve got a gas station smoothie in hand,  
song lyrics crumpled in my pocket and  
your arm slung around my shoulders.

This is sisterhood.

iii.

I am twenty-three, sitting on the sofa  
in your grown-up apartment.  
There’s a worn IKEA rug and  
mismatched coffee mugs on display,  
a home but not one I know.

We’re separated now for  
most of the year by  
three provinces and three thousand kilometres,  
but it might as well be an ocean,

or maybe a black hole where  
cell reception goes to die.

I haven’t seen you since last Christmas  
and we are strangers now,  
hesitant as we reacquaint ourselves with  
stiff exchanges about school and  
the weather and  
when we last called Mom,

and there is an unknown man lurking  
in the background of it all, lamplight  
glinting off the matching wedding bands  
on your fingers.

Sometimes I think that the only  
thing we share now is the  
blood in our veins and matching  
tattoos on our ankles—  
my eye on yours,  
and yours on mine.

But you’re taking a shower now and  
your playlist spills out from under  
the door, the same songs we discovered  
together from night drives and  
napkin lyrics;

and the books on your shelf are  
the same ones I used to steal—  
*borrow without permission*—  
and even the new ones are  
ones that I’ve read;

and your smile in all the photos  
hanging on your walls is still  
the same one I wear on my face.

My sister still exists within this stranger,  
I think,  
or perhaps it is the stranger existing  
within my sister,  
or perhaps I am the stranger now.

In front of me, your baby starts to cry.  
Even tiny and scrunched up,  
I recognize the curve of his nose,  
the slope of his brow.

I put his bottle on to warm and  
hold him against my chest,  
sway him back and forth to the beat  
of Toronto indie rock.

Soon you’ll come out of the shower,  
but he’ll already be fed and back to sleep.  
You’ll sit next to me on the couch and  
I’ll comb through curls,  
wrangle it into two braids like  
you used to do mine.

This is sisterhood.

1nrbxzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1nrbxzq/the_lessons/,The lessons.,"What you learned. What I learned. What we learned together.

Were they worth the heartbreak?

Some days, it’s a resounding yes. Some days, like this dreary grey morning, I wish it never happened. That we never happened. Now, instead of being former lovers, old friends and long distance confidantes, we are back to being strangers. To each other, nothing. As if we never forged this connection over 8 years over shared laughs, quiet evenings and trauma bonding. Every word from me to you, a lesson. Every word from you to me, a lesson.

I know the odds were always stacked against us, even then. You said you had feelings, that you missed me. But you didn’t want to fall in love. Here’s the truth though: then as in now, you *couldn’t* fall in love. With me. Id always be too much. I’d never be enough. The impenetrable glass you put around your heart, a lesson. I could very clearly see your heart, in little peeks at least. Sadly, you made sure that I’d never feel it, hard as I tried.

But you must know: I was ready to go anywhere you asked me to. As long as you would meet me there as my anchor. I loved who I was when I was with you, a sparkly version of me. Intelligent. Attractive. Calm. No amount of bitterness will erase that. The classic win-lose situation. Who am I without you? Can I still be that sparkly version of myself that I love? without you? That version of me, a lesson.

Sometimes things that remind me of you bring a little smile to my face, grateful at the time we shared together. Long meandering midnight chats. Derry Girls. The random bits of information. Light pecks on your ruddy cheeks and desperate make outs I needed like oxygen. The thousands shared references. Your dry wit. My girly cackle in response. Four days bringing chaos to the city I love. Your messy dark hair under my searching fingers. Sharing every meal together. The side of my bed where you so peacefully slept. Your adorable bed head. The way you always volunteered to drive. That one beach. How our bodies reacted to each others. How you took your coffee. Your thoughtful acts of service. How your presence filled my apartment. Our fleeting little cocoon. You were so close, yet 3200mi away. You were a million excuses away. Your heart, if there was any place in it for me, was light years away. Every mile, a lesson.

Even so, the space you left when i finally called it quits, *had to call it quits* yearns so badly for you. So badly that it knocks the wind out of me. What floods into that empty space? Tears. The quiet kind that roll down my cheeks. But also the helpless, desperate kind that fall on my bathroom floor. The sobs that shake my body. In the silence, my helpless, primal cries. Every tear, a lesson.

I barely have the will to keep myself from dialing you. To hear your voice again. To spend a minute connected to you. Just you. Just us. Like it used to be. But my resolve to truly, truly move on is just a bit stronger. I look forward to the days when you become a funny and ridiculous story of my misspent youth. I value my health and peace over any chance there could be to be yours. At this point in my journey, you are too much of a risk and I love myself more than anything left up to chance. Even you. Especially you. Every risk I took for you, a lesson.

Still. I wonder how you are faring without my softness and love. Without the heart that for 9 months was so foolish for you. Without the heart I begged you to see. Are you pretending it doesn’t affect you? That you don’t care that we are once again nothing to each other? Who are you without me? Do you even miss me? Are you drowning your sorrows in your vices? Other women? Are you papering over the loss with your chaos and pointless side quests? Did you just pick yourself up and continue to wax intellectual w cadre of too cool for emotions friends? Or, alone in your room do you spend your evenings missing our connection too? Nostalgic for our 8 years of friendship? The 9 months of our well-intentioned but ultimately destructive  entanglement? Every unsaid thought of me, a lesson. Every feeling your heart refuses to acknowledge, a lesson.

Oh, my sweet, wounded and desperately misunderstood friend

Im so sorry you had to be the lesson. 

I love you. Part of me will always look for you in others. Be good.

1nrbuop,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1nrbuop/what_was_your_earliest_warning_sign/,What was your earliest warning sign?,"Hi all, very new here so apologies if I’m not in the right place.

Recently, I’ve been wanting to have a drink after work each day. I think I have an addictive personality in that I have difficulty controlling impulses to do or consume things I enjoy and don’t really care about the consequences enough to stop, such as edibles, fast food, social media, and coffee.

Ironically, I don’t actually enjoy getting drunk and I have trauma from an alcoholic parent. I didn’t touch alcohol (or weed) until I was over 21 and even when I did, I always gave my drinks away after a few sips because I didn’t like the taste and it made my face and chest muscles cramp in a really weird way. My final year of college is the only time I really drank enough to get actually intoxicated, and I always preferred weed anyway because I still hate how alcohol tastes today.

In the last couple of weeks though, I’ve just been craving having a glass of wine, a cider, or a beer with dinner. Idk if it’s the sugar content more than the actual alcohol, because when I have let myself indulge in one, I am not drinking to feel buzzed, I’m just drinking it to feel… sophisticated? But when I consider just getting myself a mocktail instead of an alcoholic beverage, I’m like oh no, it isn’t the same if it’s not alcoholic, I’ll choke down the alcoholic beverage even though I don’t like it.

So I’m craving something I don’t enjoy in minimal amounts, but the act of craving is freaking me out. Idk if I should ask my boyfriend to stop keeping alcohol in the house now but if this is an early sign of a severe problem that others can relate to, I 100% will. I’ve cleaned up my life extremely well over the last 8 years and would hate to ruin it with alcohol. 

Side note, I also have OCD where the theme is that I’m secretly a bad person, and I think the fear of being/becoming an alcoholic is somewhat playing into that. Ironically, I was supposed to drink socially at one point to prove to myself that doing so wouldn’t magically turn me into a horrible person! And while that worked, this craving is really new and the first legitimate cause to fear that I’ve ever experienced.",2,1758917955.0,alcoholism,1,0.75,False

1nrbsqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nrbsqz/mixed_signals_in_person_vs_text/,Mixed signals in person vs text,"Background:
I (27m) am quite perplexed. There's a girl (23f) that I went on a coffee date with and spent time sitting and talking after class and I'm getting mixed signals. When we are in the same room, she seems into me but over text it's the opposite.

When we talk in person, she's laughing, sharing stories, making strong eye contact, complementing me. The conversation flows and we could probably talk for hours (on our coffe date, we did). She always seems excited to see me and when we've talked about going out. 

When we text isn't very different. She takes almost a day to respond. There isn't much back and forth. 

I've been thinking that maybe she just doesn't text very much. She also mentioned she has ADHD, so maybe she is just getting distracted. 

She canceled our first proper date (on Thursday) because she needed to work on her project. I texted her about going out this Sunday and am waiting to hear back.

Question:
Assuming we go on our first date and it goes well, should I tell her I'm getting mixed signals?

I feel like I just want to be straight forward and communicate my confusion. If she's into me but just not great about texting, then I can work with that. If she isn't really that interested, then I feel having that conversation sooner rather than later would save us both time and energy spent on dates that are going nowhere. She's also said that she values communication. So, I feel that taking the direct approach may be best.

My mom (and dog) got in a car accident yesterday. She had just gotten coffee and was driving through an intersection during a GREEN light. A guy on the other side of the intersection who was in the left turning lane decided to attempt a U turn and this caused my mom who had a green light to crash into him (T bone). Airbags went off and the car is crushed at the front. My mom has 2 wrist/ thumb fractures, her thumb nail RIPPED OFF COMPLETELY, bruises all over her stomach/ chest/ arms. Neck pain etc. She was taken to hospital of course and so was the passenger in the other car. My dog is okay but I took her to the vet ($260) she has some back pain. This accident is obviously not my mom’s fault but I want to know exactly what to do. We r going through insurance of course but my mom + dog both have pain/ suffering because of this.

1nrbp1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedSpouse/comments/1nrbp1x/looking_for_support_feeling_unappreciated_and/,"Looking for support, feeling unappreciated and disconnected","Lately my partner has been so exhausted all the time, and I feel like I don’t get listened to when I talk. They don’t really show appreciation for what I do, and I’m handling 100% of the housework, cooking, and working too. I also gave up my career and business that I spent over 10 years building to move, and now I’m starting completely from scratch.

We’re newly married, and I’ve told them multiple times that I need more intimacy, but it feels like the only time they want to connect is when it’s about sex, and even that is rare. My love language is quality time, and it hurts that even on their one day off, we just stay at home. I get that rest is important, but I wish there was at least some initiative to do something together, even if it’s just something small (like getting coffee or running an errand) 

When I finally said something, they got ready, but when I asked them to choose what we should do (so it wouldn’t feel like I was forcing them), they didn’t seem excited about anything I suggested. On top of that, they snap at me constantly and yell over the smallest things (they’ve never done this before in our years of being together before marriage), and I’ve stopped trying to argue back.

I feel really lonely, and I don’t know what to do. 😭 For those of you who’ve been through this stage, how did you handle the exhaustion, the lack of connection, and the feeling like you’re carrying everything on your own? Does it get better, and what helped you?",3,1758917587.0,MedSpouse,1,1.0,False

New hypothetical country prt 1,"Hello, so yesterday’s I posted about what island would be the best to create a new country. I was asking hypothetically but some people answered jokingly that they wanted in. So now I’ve decided to start a new side project. I’ve decided to on google slides make a new country. With the help of you all. You guys put down a fake/real idc name, and age, and your real job or thing you’d want to do. Also if ur a rancher what animals you could bring with you. I’ll put it on the slide and so forth. I would preferably like to go to more basic times. With like farming, ranching and mining. So not an abundance of technology. This is supposed to be fun so make it fun. I also still need an island to go to. So that would help alot aswell. So far the options I have are redonda island, Coffee cay, coronation island and South Georgia and south sandwich island. The island needs to not have any permanent residents. Country name and colors would be helpful too. 

Some country rules: 

Freedom of religion. Anybody can have any religion they want. 

I’ll be the first leader, but not necessarily permanently.
