She has been like a sister to me ever since we have met each other and has always been by each others side all the time. One problem was that when we grew closer and got used to each other Marie starts getting more and more protective of me.

For example she would turn down everyone that I talked with and would always make a big fit about it saying that I don't hang out with her often and would cry about it in hopes she gets my attention. She would also compare me to other beautiful people and start body shaming me saying I eat too much or I am trying to outshine her by being skinny so I have to eat more.

Another problem was there was no way I could talk to other people because she was in all of my classes.

When 10th grade was over, Marie went on a vacation with her family to Florida to visit her grandparents. I never felt so happy in my life. All the weight of pain and depression lifted from my shoulders.

 One day while driving to my local coffee shop I saw this guy Jay (17) who was at my school going to the coffee shop I was going to too. We had talked to each other several times but always get interrupted by Marie because of her protective behavior so we never talked that much. 

I decided to invite him over to my table because the table was empty and I was in a good mood that day. He immediately came over to my table and we had a good time and a good laugh, we also exchanged numbers considering the fact that my contacts are only my mom, dad, and ofc, Marie, so I was really happy I have someone to talk to over the summer while Marie was gone.

After that day, me and Jay would constantly talk to each other and have dates constantly, to the point he asked to be his girlfriend forever. I ofc said yes.

Summer break was over and 11th grade started and unfortunately Marie was back to school happy to see me and for reason, that day was also a good day for me so I told her how me and Jay are officially dating. After I said those words, she immediately starts crying saying she never agreed to make me go on a date and get a boyfriend. I told her to suck it up because she needs to learn to let me live my life and let her understand that she needs to be kind to others too.

 She immediately calls me a fat ass and a bitch while also crying and screaming while also hitting me hard to the point where at some parts I start bleeding or bruising. All the teachers were dragging her away.

After that I never heard a word of Marie ever again and eventually changed my entire schedule so I wouldn't have any classes with her anymore. But for some reason everyone kept telling me Marie is stalking me outside of school and in the school.

I confronted Marie about it and she said many uncanny things that I don't want to say, but I can tell you they were life threatening and disturbing. I told her if she doesn't stop I will call the cops on her and she will be taken away for good. She said that she was going to take me somewhere dark and scary while I was sleeping.

I felt so creeped out that I confronted my parents about the situation and that they were going to call the principal and the cops on her. I felt so bad and ended crying for hours, potentially begging my parents to not call them. They didn't call the cops but they told the principal which immediately expelled her from the district and the school.

I'm glad she's gone but rumors say that she was sent to the mental hospital for her mental health because it was affecting her parents too. So AITA?

1g2fzr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1g2fzr2/everything_went_wrong_today/,Everything went wrong today,"I left the house with 3 errands and one ""pick me up"" which was getting a fancy coffee

Went to my shop and they had an unusually long line. I waited, then ordered to find that they were out of the one  ingredient for my drink. I ordered a different one, waited long enough to not want it anymore, then recieved a luke warm version. It was not cheap. And it was cold out so it became cold right away.

The second errand was to drop off a coat to get lined. I walked there and the guy kindly said it wasn't worth paying for since he'd have to charge too much for it to me worth it for me. I sew a little so decided to line it myself .

 I never take transit, and just knew in my heart that I shouldn't, but decided to bus out to a fabric store. I bussed to the wrong one. It was fine but the employees just *would not* leave me alone and let me shop. One after another was just up in my face asking  if I needed help ""no thanks"" ""no thanks "" ""no thanks"" and I just decided to leave. I knew it was a bad idea and just cut it off.

I missed the bus by 30 sec and waited another 30 min. Then I mix up the stops cuz I never bus and accidentally get off 6 stops early. 

I walk a ways, then decide to stop at a 2nd hand store and just buy an XL blazer and rip it's lining out to repurpose. Fine. Got it. But half of me knows I'll never get around to it and just wasted money.

I walk the rest of the way home, and am so tired that I just decide to eat and shower. I've been feeling crappy for a while and I way overdid it in the AM. After all that, and the *time it took* I accomplished zero of my 3 errands.

I move on so to speak and after some home chores decide to set up my work computer screen to play a video game. I don't play video games but have picked up one recently for fun. I thought I'd get all set up properly on the big screen and with my headphones to have a fun ""escape"" night. Played for about 30 min and it glitched out and closed itself for ""repairs"". Waited about an hour and a half, tried to troubleshoot, and got nowhere and gave up.  I reached out to the video game reddit for help and got mocked.

Final kicker. I placed an important order for this long weekend  (where I live) on Thursday. Their website says 1 hr delivery but they typically hand deliver about 24 hrs later which is fine by me. I had no update from them yet, so I emailed them for an update. Despite the 1 hr delivery, and the fact that they're 15 min. from my house, they told me they put it in the mail from another city yesterday and gave me a tracking number with zero activity. Tomorrow is Sunday and Monday is a holiday so it's just not going to arrive.

explain the situation I am in so l'm
changing names.
-Mango (20f) is a southeast Asian girl who is friends with my friend Apple (20f) who is Black and Hispanic. I am White and Hispanic (21f) and am friends with with Apple and I never met mango until Apple introduced me. Apple told me while we started to be friends that they did not want any of their friends to know their tiktok because they were embarrassed about what they posted and I honestly get that as I have a following and I didn't care, so I never looked for her page.
At the beginning of this semester, me and apple ran into her friend and I told him that I was nervous to follow him on tiktok cuz sometimes what I post can be cringe and Apple made a joke saying ""I even have OP blocked"". Her friend called her out cuz it was weird and she said ""I was joking I wouldn't block you, you just wouldn't be able to find me"" which was fine because I wasn‚Äôt searching for it. So this Mango girl. The first time I ever met her was last semester and she said to Apple ‚Äúyour pretty for a black girl, usually their noses and lips yk?‚Äù Since then, me and Apple have talked extensively on this girls very open racism. Like if we went to black parties she would say how they were ‚Äúghetto‚Äù and she would complain ‚Äúwhy are so many Mexicans hitting on me‚Äù when we are literally at a Hispanic club. She has also said how Indian people stink as a diss because my ex of 3 years was Indian. 
I have told Apple many times how I‚Äôm not friends with this girl and I don‚Äôt like that I have to gently explain to mango every time she is racist why she is wrong in an attempt to keep peace between mango and Apple even tho Apple talks smack about her every time we see each other. 
Recently, without details that aren‚Äôt too important, mango asked apple to go study at a coffee shop and Apple wanted me to come because she was mad at mango. I asked her ‚Äúyou still want to go???‚Äù And she said yes so even tho I had an exam the next day I went with. I had to bail out early and not hang out because I needed to get to sleep for my exam but I saw on mangos tiktok a video of all the girls I was with that night. And in the tags was my friend Apple. And upon realizing I clicked the @ to find that yes, she ABSOLULTY did block me. 
I went and blocked the mango girl and unfollowed Apple on everything because I don‚Äôt care that she didn‚Äôt want me to see her tiktok. I respected it and I think it‚Äôs on principle that why would I be blocked as someone who didn‚Äôt do anything to her and she keeps the racist girl who she always talks smack about. I find to be wary of people that are willing to talk about other people but not cut them off especially if they are problematic.

He's been telling people we're in a relationship. What do I do?,"I don't even know how to explain this situation. It feels like I'm part of one of those thriller-drama shows. My ex-boyfriend (25M), who we'll call Mark, and I (24F) had been dating for about three years. I've tried breaking up with him simply because I don't feel a romantic spark anymore. I thought he was a great guy, but after these few months, I'm realizing he's not.

Here's where the breakup part comes in. Three months ago, I sat down with Mark and explained that I no longer wanted to be in a relationship, but I would like for us to remain friends. We live together in my apartment, so I said that he could keep living here until he finds another place to live. He seemed to take it well enough, and I thought that would be the end of it. 

However, the next morning, I'm up making myself coffee before work when I feel a pair of arms around me and a kiss on my cheek. He says, ""Morning, beautiful,"" and I sort of reel back from it all. I swat his arms away from off of me and remind him that I broke up with him the night prior. He then says, ""Oh, I didn't think you were actually serious."" I told him that I was very serious, and he seemed to back off until after I got home from work. He had made dinner for us, and I wasn't too suspicious until he mentioned that this felt like 'old times'. I asked him what he meant, but he brushed it off, saying he was just thinking out loud. I tell him again that we're broken up, and he says he understand, so I let it go.

He would occasionally do things that could be seen as romantic, but also very platonic, such as sitting closer to me at gatherings or hugging onto me in public. If it ever got uncomfortable, I'd tell him and he'd back off, so I didn't want to assume he was doing anything with romantic intent. Looking back, I want to kick myself for not asserting myself more.

It was about a week ago when everything crashed and burned around me. One of our mutual friends, who I'll call Blake (24M), called Mark's phone. Since Mark was in the shower, I thought I'd answer and tell Blake that. I picked up the phone, and Blake and I had a small conversation, mostly just of stuff we had done in the past week. Blake then said something that formed a pit in my stomach: ""How was your date last night?"" I asked him what he meant, and he said Mark told him that he had taken me out for dinner and to go to our local pumpkin patch. I told him that that never happened, much less any date of any sorts, since we were broken up. Blake was silent on the other end for a minute before saying that I was joking with him. When I insisted that I was very much serious, he went silent again. He then told me that I should look through Mark's messages, at least between him and Blake, because they said something different. My heart felt like it stopped, but I did what Blake said after we hung up. 

Not only were there conversations about dates Mark and I had supposedly gone on, but there were whole conversations about our sex life. Mark had made up things to not just Blake, but to many of his other friends and family about the relationship that was no longer going on. I felt sick to my stomach. I took some screenshots of some of the conversations, but not all of them. I wasn't sure how long Mark would be in the shower. I sent the screenshots to myself before setting his phone down and going to pack a bag. Mark soon came out of the shower, and I made up some bullshit excuse about needing to go stay with my parents for a few weeks to help them with things around their house. 

I've been staying with my parents ever since. Mark found out that I sent myself screenshots, because he was non-stop texting and calling my phone after I had left, and I had quickly blocked him. He hasn't shown up to my parents' house, but I fear if he ever will. I'm not sure what to do, and any and all advice is welcome. I just want things to go back to normal.

I asked if I should leave, or if I could sleep over?  She said I should stay and then promptly fell asleep.  I was so elated, I couldn't sleep. At this point, I was working second shift, and was used to staying up late.  I slid silently out of bed, went out the front door and smoked a cigarette.  When I went back in, I noticed that her kitchen was a mess, and she had a sink full of dishes.  Her living room had a few glasses, too.  I wanted to do something nice for her, so I started rinsing the dishes and loading the dishwasher, by the time I was finished it was full.  So, I looked under the sink and found the detergent, loaded it and started it up.  

I woke up before her, so I slid out of the bed again, went to the kitchen and started putting away the dishes.  She walked in on me as I was finishing up and asked what I was doing?  I told her, the dishes, with a playful tone, and put the last of the forks and spoons away.  

She said that it was creepy and weird that I would do that.  I explained that I didn't go through anything else that wasn't dishes related.  I just looked for where plates go, and put them there, bowls, spoons, etc...  I apologized and said that I had a great night and that I just wanted to show my appreciation and demonstrate one of the pros of having me hanging around.   She said that she didn't like it.

This person I noticed started going to breaks and lunches at the same time‚Ä¶ I would see them in the hallways at the same time and see them walk out the doors at the same time. So they must have changed their schedule or something.

To me this is all coincidence. She works in another department.

They started making a big deal about going at the same time. I heard them talking to their friends saying ‚ÄúTHATS HIM THATS THE GUY FOLLOWING ME‚Äù. She has said this several times and I just ignored it.

One time I was walking to break I saw she had her phone up like she was taking my picture.

I was getting coffee like I did every day, and I heard her behind me say ‚Äúoh no it‚Äôs him I‚Äôll just come back later‚Äù

So instead of getting coffee at work to avoid her, I decided to get Starbucks on my breaks. The day I decided to start, she was outside walking the parking lot‚Ä¶ I saw her and she quickly lifted her phone and took a picture.

One day, I was helping out a coworker and she was walking‚Ä¶ she stopped in her tracks, I looked up and saw her‚Ä¶ being frustrated at the situation I lifted my hand a little bit and just said ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù And she ran.

Ever since then she‚Äôs been very scared of me. When she sees me she will RUN away. One time I heard her talk about me and her friends said ‚Äújust file an HR claim‚Äù ‚Äúif I were you I‚Äôd just file an HR claim‚Äù she said she wouldn‚Äôt.

Introducing rapper, producer, singer-songwriter, and skateboarder, LUKE, born Luke Deloris James was born in Los Angeles, California on October 30, 1992. From a young age, Luke has been interested in Skateboarding and music. At the age of 7, he got his first skateboard as a birthday gift. At first, he didn‚Äôt know what to do with it until he saw other kids in his neighborhood riding skateboards. He joined them and learned to do tricks and even entered his first skateboard competition at the age of 10. 

In 2005, at the age of 13, Luke began listening to rap music at the skate park with his friends. His favorite rappers he had heard there were Lil Wayne, Mos Def, and Lupe Fiasco. This inspired him to want to become a rapper and skater. That summer, Luke worked at his father's coffee shop and saved up enough to buy his own 2005 Apple IBook G4 computer. He downloaded the newly released GarageBand and began learning the basics of music. Learning how to produce his own beats, write his own lyrics, and shoot his music videos. All of this practice came in handy when in 2009, at the age of 17, he entered himself into a freestyle competition with a winning prize of $100,000. He came in first place and with the money he gave his parents $25,000 each and with the rest he used to begin work on his debut single. 

For the next two years, Luke was writing, recording, producing, mixing, and mastering his very first track. He wanted it to be perfect. Telling his friends and people around the neighborhood who had been wondering, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs coming soon.‚Äù The anticipation in his hometown was high. He knew he couldn‚Äôt disappoint. Summer of 2011 was rolling around and Luke felt this would be the perfect time to release it. He saved up money he had been making working with his father and used it to fund a music video and enough money to promote his song. And by October 2011, he was ready to release the song. He titled it ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù and pressed release, along with the music video. The song debuted with 1.4 million streams. And with his first paycheck, he went to the skate shop and bought a new skateboard after using the same one for the last 12 years. He also bought new studio equipment and got to work on his second song. The following week, his song ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at #100. His first song had charted. He was beyond excited. This further made him eager to work on his debut album. And that‚Äôs what he did. He got straight to work.

My tongue has lots of dead cells on it, and my stomach I‚Äôm guessing is somewhat messed up. 

I do snus all the time instead of cigs, and coffee energy instead of alcohol. 

I still have major addictive tendencies. 

But back to the subject line, in terms of like eating, ( also just keep in mind I‚Äôve drank for over 20 years ). 

Anyone try to change there diet in the early stages ? Or stay away from specific foods. 

Thanks so much don‚Äôt drink !

I was so confused because I very rarely go in there unless it's to pick up something small like seasoning or coffee creamer. I'm so confused. I'm absolutely angry, I also feel so humiliated. She did this in front of everyone in line. I know for a fact I didn't steal, but the way she went about this was so embarrassing. I understand where she was coming from, but I'm definitely not a doormat. I don't know what to do about this situation, I plan on going in tomorrow to ask the store manager if I can see the footage and if they refuse, I don't know what to do after that, but I really am super fucking angry. 

What do I do in this situation?",1,1728783587.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Tired of spending a fortune on your vegetable garden?¬†

You're not alone!¬† Many gardeners are looking for ways to grow their own food without breaking the bank. And that's where free vegetable gardening hacks come in.¬† This article is packed with practical tips and tricks that'll help you transform your garden into a thriving oasis of fresh produce ‚Äì all without emptying your wallet.¬†

We'll cover everything from repurposing everyday items into valuable gardening tools to using nature's free resources like rainwater and mulch to create a bountiful harvest. Get ready to learn creative ways to build free raised beds, grow potatoes using the mulch method, and even grow delicious peas and beans from seeds you already have in your pantry.¬†

Whether you're a seasoned gardener or just starting out, these 17 free gardening hacks are sure to boost your garden's potential and inspire you to grow more for less.¬† Let's get started!

# 1. Transforming Trash into Treasure: Repurposing Materials for Free Gardening

[Tyres make the perfect pot](https://preview.redd.it/asyd329chfud1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=707df3718c8c0e7f8f6cdf1f9374c2f17e03acb0)

Let's face it, sometimes the most useful gardening tools are the ones that have already served their purpose in another life. We're talking about recycling, but with a twist!¬† Instead of tossing out those old yogurt containers, plastic bottles, and even those pesky egg cartons, we're going to give them a second chance at greatness.¬† 

Think of it as a garden makeover with a side of environmental consciousness.¬† Those empty yogurt pots?¬† They're about to become chic plant labels.¬† 

No more scribbling on sticks that get lost in the green jungle!¬† And those plastic bottles?¬† Well, they're practically begging to be transformed into miniature greenhouses, perfect for starting seeds indoors before they're ready for the big wide world.¬† 

And let's not forget the humble egg carton ‚Äì a haven for starting seedlings and a surprisingly stylish way to organize your garden.¬† 

So, ditch the expensive store-bought tools and get ready to unleash your inner upcycling master.¬† Your garden will thank you (and so will the planet!).

**DIY Plant Labels from Recycled Containers**

Remember those days when you were tempted to buy those adorable, pre-printed plant labels?¬† They looked so charming, sitting in their little packs, promising to keep your garden perfectly organized.¬† But let's be honest, those little labels often vanished faster than a freshly planted seed.¬† 

*And then there's the price tag* - they can add up, especially if you're trying to label a whole veggie patch.¬† So, this is where the power of repurposing comes in!¬† Those empty yogurt pots, ice cream tubs, and even cream containers are about to get a second chance at life ‚Äì as durable and free plant labels.¬† 

Think of it as a zero-waste approach to gardening.¬† Simply wash and dry the containers, and you've got yourself a blank canvas for creativity.¬† Get out your trusty marker pens and get to work!¬† Write the name of the plant, maybe add a little drawing for good measure, and voil√†!¬† You've created a stylish and free plant label that's sure to last through the seasons.¬†

 So next time you're tempted to buy store-bought labels, remember the power of repurposing.¬† It's fun, it's thrifty, and it's good for the planet!¬† Just don't forget to make a little space for those empty containers in your recycling bin!

¬†**Build Free Raised Beds from Pallets**

Who needs expensive raised beds when you've got a pile of discarded pallets just begging for a new purpose?¬† That's right, folks!¬† Pallets, those sturdy wooden platforms that carry everything from furniture to building supplies, can be transformed into the ultimate free raised beds for your vegetable garden.¬† 

It's like giving them a second chance at life, and your garden will be the envy of the neighborhood.¬† 

Think about it.¬† 

Not only are you saving a ton of money, but you're also giving those pallets a new life, proving that you're a true eco-warrior at heart.¬† And let's not forget about the benefits.¬† Raised beds offer excellent drainage, making them ideal for vegetables that prefer a little extra air.¬† Plus, they can be placed anywhere, even on uneven terrain, making them perfect for those challenging garden spots.¬† 

So, grab some tools, get your hands dirty, and get ready to unleash your inner pallet-pro.¬† You'll be amazed at what you can create, and your garden will be the ultimate testament to the power of repurposing.¬† Now go forth and conquer those pallets!

# 2. Smart Planting Strategies for a Thriving Garden

Alright, green thumbs, it's time to unleash your inner gardening guru!¬† Forget the guesswork and embrace the power of strategic planting.¬† 

We're talking about time-tested techniques that will transform your garden from a haphazard collection of plants into a thriving oasis of fresh produce.¬† First up, the art of companion planting.¬† This is like a garden matchmaking service, pairing plants that love each other's company, boosting growth and even repelling pesky pests.¬† 

For example, basil and tomatoes are a match made in gardening heaven, with the basil deterring tomato hornworms.¬† 

*Next, let's talk about succession planting* ‚Äì the ultimate trick for ensuring a continuous harvest throughout the growing season.¬† Think of it as a garden relay race, where you're constantly planting new crops to replace those that have finished their cycle.¬† Imagine a never-ending supply of fresh veggies!¬† 

And don't forget about those precious pollinators ‚Äì bees, butterflies, and other helpful critters that are essential for fruit and vegetable production.¬† Make sure your garden is a haven for these pollinators by planting flowers that attract them, and you'll be rewarded with a bountiful harvest.¬† 

So, embrace these simple techniques, and your garden will be buzzing with life and brimming with delicious produce.¬† Happy planting!

**The Mulch Method for Growing Potatoes**

Forget digging trenches!¬† The mulch method for growing potatoes is like a lazy gardener's dream come true.¬† It's simple, it's effective, and it's a great way to use up those piles of leaves and straw that tend to accumulate around your property.¬† Think of it as a giant potato burrito.¬† 

First, you start by planting your potato seed pieces in a mound of soil.¬† 

Then, as your potato plants start to grow, you simply pile on the mulch ‚Äì leaves, straw, hay ‚Äì whatever you have on hand.¬† As the plants grow taller, you continue adding mulch, creating a cozy little potato nest.¬† The mulch does wonders!¬† It keeps the soil moist, prevents weeds from taking over, and even helps control pests.¬†

Plus, as the potatoes grow, they actually sprout new tubers along the stems buried under the mulch.¬† It's like a potato magic trick!¬† So ditch those traditional potato rows and give the mulch method a try.¬† It's a fun and rewarding way to grow a bumper crop of potatoes, and you'll be amazed at how easy it is.¬†

Plus, you'll be reducing your garden waste in the process.¬† Now that's what I call a win-win situation!

¬†**Natural Slug Barriers with Bramble Canes**

¬†Slugs, those slimy garden invaders, can wreak havoc on your precious seedlings.¬† 

They're like tiny, stealthy ninjas, leaving trails of destruction in their wake.¬† But fear not, dear gardener, for there's a simple and effective way to deter these pesky creatures ‚Äì bramble canes!¬† 

Those prickly branches, often found growing wild in hedgerows, can be your secret weapon against the slimy hordes.¬† Simply gather a few branches and create a protective barrier around your vulnerable seedlings.¬† Slugs, being the delicate creatures they are, will avoid those prickly thorns at all costs.¬† 

Think of it as a natural fortress, keeping your plants safe and sound.¬† You can also create a ring of copper tape or coffee grounds around your plants, as slugs don't like to cross copper or the smell of coffee.¬† These natural slug deterrents are not only effective but also environmentally friendly.¬† 

So, grab a handful of bramble canes and say goodbye to those slimy invaders.¬† Your garden will thank you for it.¬† Just remember to wear gloves when handling the canes ‚Äì those thorns can be surprisingly sharp!

¬†**Timing Your Planting for Rain-Powered Growth**

¬†Water, water, everywhere, but not a drop to spare?¬† That's the dilemma of many a gardener, especially during those dry spells.¬† But fret not, my fellow green thumbs, for there's a secret weapon for maximizing free rainwater and minimizing your watering duties: timing!¬† 

It's all about planting those seeds and seedlings at just the right time, when Mother Nature is ready to do the heavy lifting.¬† Think of it as a garden dance, a synchronized movement between you and the heavens.¬† By planting during or just before rainfall, you're giving your new plants the perfect head start.¬† 

The rain acts as a natural irrigation system, ensuring that your seedlings get the moisture they need to thrive.¬† Plus, it's like a free spa treatment for your garden soil, loosening it up and making it easier for roots to spread.¬†

So, ditch those watering cans (at least for a while) and embrace the power of rain-powered growth.¬† Keep an eye on the weather forecast and get those seeds in the ground when the clouds are ready to unleash their watery bounty.¬† 

Your garden will thank you for it, and so will your water bill!¬† It's a win-win situation, all thanks to the magic of timing.¬†

# 3. Monthly Planting Plans for Consistent Harvest

Imagine a garden that's a perpetual feast, a symphony of fresh produce that never stops playing.¬† No more waiting weeks for your veggies to mature, only to have them all come at once, leaving you with a glut of zucchini and a dwindling appetite for summer squash.¬† 

It's time to embrace the power of the monthly planting plan ‚Äì a strategic roadmap to a consistent harvest.¬† Think of it as a garden calendar, a guide to planting the right crops at the right time to ensure a continuous stream of deliciousness.¬† 

For example, you might plant cool-season crops like lettuce and spinach in the early spring, followed by warm-season crops like tomatoes and peppers as the weather warms up.¬† 

Then, in the fall, you can plant a second wave of cool season crops to extend the harvest even longer.¬† 

By strategically planning your plantings, you'll be harvesting fresh vegetables all year round.¬† It's like having a garden that's constantly surprising you with its bounty.¬† 

No more bland meals, no more grocery store runs.¬† 

Just a continuous flow of fresh, homegrown goodness.¬† So, ditch the haphazard planting schedule and embrace the magic of the monthly planting plan.¬† Your garden will thank you, and your taste buds will be dancing!

¬†**Plan Ahead for Continuous Growth**

Imagine a garden that's a culinary time machine, a place where you can savor the flavors of summer even when the snow is falling.¬† It's all about embracing the power of strategic planning, a little foresight that transforms your garden into a perpetual feast.¬† 

No more those frustrating periods of feast or famine, where you're swimming in zucchini one week and wondering what to eat the next.¬† The key is to think ahead, to anticipate your garden's rhythm and plan your plantings accordingly.¬† 

Think of your garden as a relay race, where you're constantly planting new crops to replace those that have finished their cycle.¬† Start with cool-season crops like lettuce, spinach, and kale in the early spring, then transition to warm-season crops like tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers as the weather warms up.¬† 

As the summer fades, you can even plant another wave of cool-season crops to extend the harvest even longer.¬† By planning ahead, you'll ensure that your garden is always bursting with fresh, homegrown goodness.¬†

 It's like having a personal farmer's market in your own backyard, a delightful surprise with every harvest.¬†

**Maximizing Space and Time**

Think of your garden as a real estate mogul, maximizing every inch of space and squeezing out multiple harvests in a single growing season.¬† 

It's all about embracing the art of succession planting, a strategy that turns your garden into a culinary juggernaut.¬† Instead of letting those empty spaces after a crop finishes its cycle go to waste, you can simply plant something new!¬† Imagine a symphony of growth, with different crops taking the stage throughout the season.¬†

 For example, after harvesting early peas, you can plant a fast-growing summer squash or cucumbers.¬† 

Or, after a row of spinach or lettuce is done, you can replace them with a heat-loving tomato or pepper plant.¬† It's like a garden relay race, where each crop passes the baton to the next, ensuring that you're always enjoying fresh produce.¬† 

And the best part is that you're making the most of your valuable garden space, getting more bang for your buck, literally!¬† 

So, ditch the empty patches and embrace the power of succession planting.¬† Your garden will be a constant source of fresh, homegrown goodness, and you'll be amazed at the amount of food you can grow in a relatively small space.¬† It's a garden revolution, one plant at a time!

# ¬†4. Beyond the Basics: Additional Tips for Free Gardening Success

Alright, green thumbs, it's time to level up your gardening game!¬† We've covered the basics, but now it's time to dive into some secret techniques and tricks that will transform your garden from good to extraordinary.¬† 

Think of it as a master class in garden magic, where you'll learn to unlock the secrets of a bountiful harvest.¬† 

First up, the power of compost tea!¬† It's like a magic potion for your plants, brimming with beneficial bacteria and nutrients that help your garden thrive.¬† Simply brew a tea from compost and use it to water your plants, giving them a boost of natural goodness.¬† 

Next, let's talk about companion planting, a strategy that involves pairing certain plants together for mutual benefit.¬† For example, basil and tomatoes are a match made in heaven, with the basil helping to repel pests that can damage tomatoes.¬† And don't forget the art of seed saving!¬† 

It's a frugal gardener's dream, allowing you to collect seeds from your existing plants and start new ones for free.¬† This is a great way to create your own heirloom varieties and pass them on to future generations of gardeners.¬† 

So, embrace these advanced techniques and watch your garden soar to new heights.¬† You'll be amazed at what you can achieve with a little creativity and a sprinkle of garden magic!¬†

**Grow From Your Kitchen:¬† Repurposing Dried Peas and Beans**

Hold on to your gardening hats, because this one is a real game-changer!¬† Turns out, those dried peas and beans lurking in your pantry aren't just for delicious meals.¬†

They're actually tiny little miracles waiting to sprout into a flourishing garden.¬† Think of it as a culinary time warp, where you can turn your leftover beans into a bountiful harvest.¬†It's all about embracing the power of seed saving, but with a twist!¬† No need to go searching for fancy seed packets.¬† 

Simply soak those dried peas and beans in water overnight to soften them up, then plant them in a pot or directly in the ground.¬† It's like a secret gardening hack, turning your pantry into a seed bank.¬† 

And the best part?¬† 

You're guaranteed to have success because you already know those beans and peas are going to grow!¬† Plus, it's incredibly rewarding to watch those tiny seeds transform into vibrant plants, producing a delicious bounty.¬† 

So, next time you're about to toss out those leftover beans, think twice.¬† 

Give them a second chance at life and reap the rewards of a delicious and free harvest.¬† Your pantry will be happy, your garden will be thriving, and you'll be amazed at the power of simple seed saving.

**Easy Weeding Strategies**

Weeding, that dreaded garden chore that can feel like an endless battle against a relentless army of green invaders.¬† But fear not, dear gardener, for there are ways to wage war on weeds without sacrificing your precious free time.¬† 

It's all about embracing smart strategies, turning those weeds into a minor annoyance rather than a garden-consuming monster.¬† First, let's talk about mulch.¬† It's like a natural shield, suppressing weeds by blocking sunlight and preventing seeds from germinating.¬† Use a thick layer of organic mulch like straw, wood chips, or shredded leaves to keep those pesky weeds at bay.¬† Next, consider the power of pre-emergent herbicides.¬† 

They're like a preventative measure, creating a barrier to stop weed seeds from sprouting in the first place.¬† Just remember to apply them before the weeds have a chance to show their faces.¬† 

And finally, let's not forget the power of regular weeding!¬† It's like a mini workout for your garden, keeping those pesky weeds from getting out of control.¬† 

The key is to tackle them early before they have a chance to spread their roots.¬† So, embrace these easy weeding strategies, and you'll have more time to enjoy your garden and less time fighting off those pesky invaders.¬† Your garden will thank you for it!

**Multifunctional Gardening: Using Wood Chips for Pathways and Mulch**

Who needs fancy paving stones when you have a mountain of free wood chips just waiting to be transformed?¬† 

That's right, those wood chips are about to become the stars of your garden, creating beautiful and functional pathways and a healthy layer of mulch.¬†

It's like a two-for-one deal, where you're getting a stylish garden upgrade while also giving those wood chips a second chance at life.¬† 

Think of them as the ultimate multitaskers, adding a touch of rustic charm to your garden while suppressing weeds and keeping the soil moist.¬† Simply spread a thick layer of wood chips around your garden beds, creating a beautiful pathway that's both attractive and practical.¬† 

And don't forget to use those wood chips as a protective layer of mulch, providing a cozy haven for your plants, preventing weeds from taking root, and keeping moisture locked in.¬† You'll be amazed at the difference it makes!¬† 

So next time you see a pile of wood chips, don't just walk by.¬† Grab a wheelbarrow and transform them into a garden masterpiece.¬† Your wallet will be happy, your garden will be thriving, and you'll be proving once again that you're a master of repurposing.

#DREAM: ONE

***the dream where i am a serial killer/ ax murderer.*** 

it starts off pretty normal. 
wake up for school, do my morning routine (pluck eyebrows, shower, light makeup, pack books, etc.) and start walking to school. 

i get to school and for no reason, completely unprovoked, i just start hacking and slashing through everyone and everything. in the dream i feel both crazed and at peace. it's a weird feeling. 
it's a big ax that i usually use, and i just go through the hallways hunting down the most random people and chopping away. 
by the time the remaining survivors escape, school is over and i am soaked in blood. 

i get home and do the same thing. i feel oddly calm by now tho. just walk into the house, decapitate, disfigure, dismember and discard my older brother, my mother and father. 
i get away scott free as if it's the most normal thing ever to just get an ax and kill people. 
and walk around with blood dripping from you. almost seeping into your skin. 

*i feel weird about this dream. and scared.* 


#DREAM: TWO

***the dream that features trixie mattel***

{*trixie is a drag queen*} 

starts off with a normal day. me and my family go down to the beach and have a good time. all of a sudden, trixie is there. she is wearing this really cool purple latex jumpsuit with a white faux fur (mob wife style) jacket. her hair is done up really nice and her makeup is REALLY well done. 
i wander away from the family
 (they don't notice bc in the dream i also feel very abandoned by them. like isolated and put to one side. ignored)

i go say hi and start a convo with her. then we go get drinks and eat cake. 

a while afterwards, the family sees me hanging out with her and they don't like it. (trixie is a drag queen, if you didn't know already) they say something along the lines of ""goddamn queers stealing away uhhh (they proceed to forget my name)!!"" then they all whip out pistols and aim at us. we get into trixies car and get outta there. they chase us, we get home and (i forget this part) all of a sudden everything is fine and great. then, it's my brother's birthday and as usual, i start feeling neglected. trixie is there and suggests we get ice cream but my mom says no and we go to his birthday party. 

it's an elaborate dining hall with really high ceilings and well detailed architectural designs and trinkets, with a BIG fireplace behind the head of the table. me and trixie get snacks and we sneak away. 
we go joyriding. and randomly, my little brother is running the same speed as the car telling us that ""mom is out to get you"". so we just don't go home. suddenly my dad finds us and shoots trixie. 
as she dies, she gives me her wig?... *yeah. it's just weird.
but usually i wake up from this one crying bc it's really emotional.*

#DREAM: THREE 

***gerard way***

in this dream, i am living in a really nice Victorian Era home. somewhat small but has a nice BIG garden with a pond, a little bridge, etc. Basically it's my dream house. 

and there's this big tree in the middle of the garden. with a treehouse. 
(like a REALLY nice treehouse) 

so, gerard way lives in this treehouse. 
but it's the post-covid ""gnome era"" gerard.
he's like SUCH a father figure in this dream. anyways, for the most part of this dream, i am in recovery from serious affects of mental health issues and i am living with my dog and cat. (i'm allergic to the cat but i still have him)

and,one day i decide to walk outside and see gerard in this treehouse, drinking coffee. i go up and he offers me some coffee and the whole time, we just drink coffee, do puzzles and draw and talk about EVERYTHING. like, art, wars, anything, really. 

so that's the most of what happened until one day, the other band members show up and they host a charity concert, which is managed by my primary school art teacher. (he was a W teacher. amazing person. loved him) 
and then, when that's done we all go back home (they're crashing there) but for an unknown reason, i have a huge mental breakdown. parts of this are like flashbacks to when i actually DID self harm and it was REALLY BAD. i just start drinking heavily. like chasing painkillers with tequila and vodka and other hard liquor and i start self harming and am bleeding out on the floor of my bathroom. 
anyways, so frank and mikey find me. i'm passed out and they take me to the hospital. when i wake up, gerard and ray are there dressed in a doctor's uniform.
i get better, we all go back home. 
gerard suddenly goes from ""gnome era"" to ""revenge era"" at some point. 

and then it repeats but worse this time. 
so then we're back home again.
the rest is fuzzy and it ends with me eating pizza in their tour van with them.

*i also wake up crying from this one* 

**anyways here's things about me that might help:**
- i am adopted. 
(i do know who my real parents are, they were just unable to provide me with the life i needed. i am still in contact with them today) 

- i really like MCR. 
(my chemical romance) 

- i love watching Rupaul's Drag Race and i love Trixie Mattel. i think she's a cool person. 

- i have ‚ú®diagnosed bipolar‚ú® (not fun, but i am medicated) 

- i was kicked out of the house for dying my hair without my A mom's permission. (this happened a few weeks ago. i am 18, a legal adult, but still a dependent. i live with my boyfriend and his family now, so that is all good) 

- i've always been a bit weird and somewhat rebellious or ""other"". 
(like non-conforming bc i believe in having independent thoughts.)

1g2erun,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g2erun/guy_says_hes_interested_but_his_actions_show/,Guy says he's interested but his actions show otherwise?? When to move on??,"I (30F) started talking to a guy (30M) about a month ago.

Once I stop talking to someone on a dating app and move to talking to them via phone number, I do them the courtesy of stop using any dating apps and stop talking to them. I'm not good at the whole ""multiple talking stages"" thing.

But jfc¬†***this guy.***

I've gotten together with him a total of TWO times in a month. and it's been like pulling teeth trying to organize something. It wasn't even actual dates. Just coming over to my place. When he's been over, it's just been a lot of making out and kissing, which feels pretty ""high school."" I've complained to him that I don't like things starting out so physical but he just says ""when you know, you know so you shouldn't waste any time."" I've found his mentality somewhat strange.

When we text, he's pretty sporadic. Hours go by in his responses and they are pretty random in content. He'll just send me random videos and memes and I'm not too sure how to reply...but at least he's sending me...something?

I've point blank asked him if he's interested because I've told him it doesn't seem like it and I've even told him this feels pretty casual which I'm not into and I've tried to end it several times because I don't understand what this is.

Each time I've done that, he's freaked out and started sending paragraphs and done the whole ""no this is serious, I'm interested thing"" etc. but actions are not matching words. Honestly, his lack of interest and effort is a super big turn off to me, but I am trying to give him a chance here mainly because this whole thing is just so confusing.

I have never ""dated"" (or whatever tf this is) someone my age. The men I am used to are usually 10 to 20 years older than me. I am used to little things like coffee dates, good morning texts, check-ins, holding hands, etc.

This is just super odd to me...

He says he's got ADHD and depression, so I'm trying to tread lightly and be understanding. I just feel like I'm getting one pulled over on me.

The question here: 1) what on earth is going on? and 2) Am I allowed to continue to be on dating apps if this guy is just sitting around dragging his feet? I have no clue if I am dating this guy or not??? It is super unclear to me.

1g2erpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1g2erpp/need_helpjust_diagnosed_with_autoimmune_gastritis/,Need Help--Just diagnosed with Autoimmune Gastritis as a college student,"Hi everyone--after a year of b-12 injection supplementation and constant pain, i finally got a diagnoses of autoimmune gastritis with pernicious anemia. I am only 21 years old and I have no history in my family of this issue, nor do I have any other autoimmune diseases (I've been tested for so many). I have no idea where to begin with learning how to live with gastritis and heal my stomach. I feel like everything i eat is bad and it is so hard to shop healthy while being in school with a limited budget. I've been going through many of the posts and I see that B-12 deficiency is considered late-stage gastritis, so does that mean i am at high risk for stomach cancer already? I've been on biweekly b-12 injections for a year now, and am barely maintaining a normal level.

I got an endoscopy done last fall and all they said was that I had stomach ulcers but I could continue to drink coffee, eat spicy foods, and tons of bad things, which is what I have been doing for the past year until I finally saw a new doctor. The original doctor only diagnosed me with IBS and said I had liver bile in my stomach and silent reflux.

I would appreciate any advice, tips, and help in how to deal with this disease--especially from people who have it chronically like me. I am scared about this lifestyle change which seems like it will be for the rest of my life, and I don't even know where to begin when it comes to getting check ups and screenings.

Currently using a Dewalt 7000w gas only gen and have been able to run 4ton variable compressor AC (essentialy built in soft start, Low LRA unit), 15-20 LED lights, two fridge/freezer combos, usual few phone chargers, and 85"" LED TV.   My gen only has a % capacity meter  so not sure what wattage I've been pulling though I suspect with the above it's been 6k at most as I haven't seen the gen meter get over \~70-80%.     

So those are the essentials I need to run.  Do I have to run more? No, but I guess having a little more headroom to be able to be run coffee maker at times or desktop computer would be nice but not necessary.   I'm savy enough and ok with load shedding as needed.  The rest of the family though may not.  

Advantage of the Genmax would certainly be the closed inverter format with the potential benefits of ""clean"" low THD power as well as lower noise, advertised at 62db.   Only negative is I just wouldn't have much headroom, about as much as I do now which isn't a deal break.

Reall the only advantage of the westinghouse would be the increased capacity to 9500w.  Might be nice to not have to worry as much about what I have going and potential benefits of running at lower percentage of the unit's capacity over the long run.   Supposedly it also has a low THD for an open frame type though did see one guy who reported up to just over 6% on load.   Only disadvantage (if low THD holds true) would be noise, usual open vs closed frame issue.   

Any other considerations to take into account between these two?  What would you do?   I know the Wgen is cheaper,  not a significant factor, I'd rather get the one that would work bette in my scenario.   Thanks!",1,1728782636.0,Generator,4,1.0,False

It's called ""ShopHold"", and it takes place in a world where anthropomorphic objects take the place of humans and vehicles take the place of dogs. The main character is a teenage camera named Lexi who gets a job at a coffee shop at a mall and most of the episodes are just her trying to get through her job or through high school. Also, there are some episodes that revolve around an evil supercomputer named Virus trying to take over the world.

Anyway, here is some concept art I created for it as well as episode scripts that I've written so far:

I booked another room in a different home.  I emailed the host prior to ask how many other visitors were there that weekend since there was only one bathroom, 3 guest rooms.  I was told I was the only visitor.  I checked in around 7pm Fri night and was immediately overcome by the smell of marijuana, patchouli, and every air freshener you can think of.  My room was at the top of the stairs and had an attached balcony.  The room was neat but filthy.  The carpet was stained, there was hair on the sheets, the bed sagged to one side.  I only had enough time to drop my bag as I had an appointment that evening. In hindsight, I should have left immediately but I had just driven 10 hours and had to leave. The next morning, I smelled coffee so clearly there was someone else in the home on the 3rd floor (guest rooms were on the 2nd floor, 3 of them).  The person also used the guest bathroom next to my room.  I left for an all day event and when I returned around 6pm, the homeowner/renter was watching football in the private area downstairs (closed door).  When I got upstairs to my room, the room I had left locked with lights off, was unlocked and the lights/fan were on.  It was obvious someone had been in my room.  Nothing was stolen but I immediately felt unsafe.  I packed my things to leave but did not message the host until after I had booked a hotel room because of the safety issue.  I'm a small female and I didn't know if it was a man or woman in the house with me.  I politely told the host why I had left and contacted Air BnB.  They opened a case and 2 weeks later, closed it siding with the host.  I plan to call and re-open it but in the meantime, the host wrote a horrific review of me on the app.  They noted that there was ""no one in the home"", that I was a liar, and should have communicated with them.  I honestly don't want to use Air BnB ever again, I am so disappointed with how they've handled this.  I'm an honest person and had 5 stars from every property I've stayed at.  Now this host is telling people beware of having this dishonest woman in your home, she will try to scam you, etc. etc.  I realize hosts likely do get dishonest people in their properties but I'm not and it makes me sick that this woman wrote lies about me and could prevent me and my family from using AirBnB again.

Of the **Daydream collection** I got: Bare Vanilla, Pure Seduction, and Velvet Petals

Amber romance didn‚Äôt appeal to me and Love Spell is just not one I‚Äôm interested in usually. I did smell it in store but decided it immediately smelled too much like the OG Love Spell to buy.

Of the **Pink Glazed collection** I got: Vanilla and Dreamy, Fresh and Clean, and Warm and Cozy.

I decided not to get Cool and Bright because pear is not a note I see myself wearing at all.


**Bare Vanilla Daydream** smells like cereal milk! Straight up fruit loops cereal in cold milk, with a creamy dry-down. This is one of the stronger ones in this collection and it lasts about an hour or two on me.


**Velvet Petals Daydream** smells like Coca Cola and milkshake to me mixed with that familiar velvet petals DNA. Dries down slightly powdery! I really love this one and will definitely be reaching for it when I want to wear something powdery and soft. 


**Pure Seduction Daydream** smells like bubblegum and melty vanilla ice cream.
It actually has that hint of OG Pure Seduction DNA but with the milky/creme note it ends up smelling pretty much just like bubblegum! I wasn‚Äôt a super big fan of the original Pure Seduction but I really like this for some reason and it may have even swayed me to give the original another shot. This is the strongest out of the daydream collection to me.



**VS PINK glazed Fresh and Clean** smells like light sugared lemon zest on top of that bright apple fresh and clean DNA. Dries down surprisingly powdery and with the tiniest hint of vanilla. Ends up smelling like sugared lemon zest on the dry-down. Very light but layers well with the lotion I wish I could see this collection be made into shimmer body powders, I feel like this scent in particular would absolutely rock as a dusting powder scent. Super sheer and sexy


**VS PINK glazed warm and cozy** smells like sour gummy worms/pop rocks to me. It‚Äôs fizzy and candied. This one is super strong to me and doesn‚Äôt resemble the original warm and cozy at all which is super surprising to me! I really like this.


**VS PINK glazed Vanilla and Dreamy** smells like glazed donuts‚Ä¶no seriously. Powdered sugar+coconut creme+donuts. I get really hungry when I wear this it‚Äôs almost inevitable it has that signature cool vanilla from the OG Vanilla and Dreamy but this one is giving donut shop allllll the way.


**VS PINK Vanilla Bean and Macadamia** smells like shortbread cookies, a warm vanilla latte, and macadamia. Just generally a warm coffee shop type of scent. It‚Äôs very autumnal to me, but this is definitely something you could wear every day and people would tell you that you smell delicious year round. I definitely need the lotion and body shimmer after this. I feel like I smell like a biscotti cookie and cocoa butter when I wear this. Not complaining!

Every day feels like more of a grind and societal pressures are compounding. Does anyone else feel like everyday life and responsibilities are more challenging than even just a few years ago?

There are so many aspects that seem this way. As a woman, the societal pressures to stay looking young and skinny have increased with most women I know getting Botox in their 30s and 40s, lip fillers, ozempic, etc. I liked looking natural in the past but it feels like I have to keep up with this societal movement of looking perfect, no wrinkles, and physically instagrammable, even more so than a decade ago.

Overall, it seems the workload at my jobs in recent years is a lot heavier and stressful, I‚Äôm barely able to take a lunch break there‚Äôs so much I‚Äôm responsible for. I‚Äôm starting early and working late, and I‚Äôm not getting ahead. Any feedback about workload is received like a complaint so have to keep that to myself and deal with it. Maybe the increase in workload is because many jobs are were eliminated during Covid and they expect workers to accomplish more with less? 

The process of getting a new job is demoralizing and exhausting. It takes 50-100 online application, AI screening your resume, 5+ interviews and assessments just to get a mediocre job with crappy benefits. You can‚Äôt even go drop off your resume and introduce yourself without seeming to strange. Our worth is reduced to how competent we come across digitally. 

Wages aren‚Äôt increasing but cost of living is higher, groceries, car insurance, health insurance, kids lessons, coffee, just everywhere you turn it seems like prices are so expensive. It seems like I was well-adjusted for most of my adult life, but now it seems pressures are affecting my mental health every day. Health insurance costs, finding doctors that aren‚Äôt booked out months in advanced, etc, spending hours making appointments during work time because nothing is open on weekends when people actually have free time.

A few years back I had a Nespresso Vertuo of which I quickly got tired of the cost vs taste. I like espresso drinks maybe a few times a week and some on the weekend and am tired of paying $5-6 at a Starbucks or local coffee shop. I don‚Äôt mind learning a bit of technique to use a semi auto, but a super auto is curious because I want fewer steps for at least a Starbucks level cup of coffee. I want a setup for lattes, americanos, cappuccinos primarily. 

Now that the background is out of the way, my question to this forum with my use case is this: will a super auto taste such as a $400 refurb Gaggia Cardona make a good enough espresso to meet my needs? Also does a super auto make as good or better coffee than something like a separate grinder, and breville bambino? 

Finally, the Ninja Lux Cafe did come out but the US version doesn‚Äôt donAmericano and that‚Äôs a deal breaker for me. But I think I‚Äôm leaning more towards one of the refurb Gaggia machines on Whole Latte Love, for ease of use. I want as few steps to get a good cup of coffee in that price, but don‚Äôt mind learning a bit if a semi auto is THAT much better. Thoughts??",1,1728780589.0,superautomatic,1,1.0,False
