1p5debh,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1p5debh/help_me_choose_a_grinder_for_gaggia_classic_pro/,Help me choose a grinder for Gaggia Classic Pro,"Hey all,

Looking for some real-world input from people who’ve actually lived with these grinders.

**My setup & use case:**

* Machine: **Gaggia Classic Pro** (UK, stock baskets – I want to use the *non‑pressurised* ones properly)
* Drinks: Mostly **flat whites / milk drinks**, so espresso is the priority
* Beans: I drink **both light and dark roasts**
* Country / budget: **UK**, budget **max \~£200**
* Current situation: Been using **pre‑ground**, I know it’s holding back the Classic Pro

I’ve narrowed it down to two main contenders (prices are what I’m currently seeing in the UK):

# Option 1 – Baratza Encore ESP – £135 (Amazon UK)

This one:  
Baratza Encore ESP 230V Electric Espresso Coffee Bean Grinder, Dual-Range Burr, Black

**Why I’m considering it:**

* Specifically marketed as **espresso capable** (ESP version, not the regular Encore)
* **Dual range**:
   * Settings **1–20** = fine espresso range (tighter steps)
   * Settings **21–40** = coarser for filter / French press etc.
* 40mm conical steel burrs, Baratza reputation, decent parts/service support
* At **£135** it seems like amazing value if it genuinely does good espresso with standard baskets

**Questions for people who own it:**

* How well does it handle **light roasts** for espresso on a machine like the Gaggia Classic Pro?
* Are the **steps fine enough** that you can properly dial in, or do you find yourself stuck between two clicks?
* Any reliability / build issues I should know about (hopper, bin, retention, static, etc.)?
* How annoying is the lack of timer / LCD in day‑to‑day use?

# Option 2 – Sage Smart Grinder Pro – £161 (with discount code)

This one: Sage / Breville **Smart Grinder Pro**, currently **£161** with a discount code in the UK coffee blog article.

**Why I’m considering it:**

* Widely recommended as a good **all‑rounder** that *can* do real espresso
* 60 grind settings, LCD display, programmable timer – seems very **user‑friendly**
* Easy to jump between espresso and other brew methods if I ever want to
* People seem to get good results with it on Classic Pros / similar machines

**Questions for owners:**

* How does it do with **light roast espresso** on standard baskets – enough range & precision?
* Are the steps fine enough, or is it a bit coarse compared to the Encore ESP in the actual espresso range?
* Any long‑term issues (impeller wear, retention, static, clumping) that would make you *not* buy it again?
* If you’ve used both the Smart Grinder Pro and an Encore ESP / similar, how would you compare the espresso quality and ease of dialing in?

# Other options?

If you think **both** of these are the wrong choice for my use case, I’m open to other suggestions, as long as they’re:

* **Available in the UK**
* **Under \~£200**
* Genuinely **espresso capable** with non‑pressurised baskets on a Gaggia Classic Pro
* Can cope with **light and dark roasts**

I’m not chasing perfection, just something that will:

* Be a **big upgrade** over pre‑ground
* Let me reliably pull tasty, consistent shots with decent crema
* Not make me want to smash it when I switch between beans

If you were me (Classic Pro, UK, both light & dark roasts, daily flat whites, budget sub‑£200), what would you buy **today** and why?

Thanks in advance for any advice / reality checks!",1,1763979349.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I'm 29. Got hit by a drunk driver back in September. Broke my leg in three places, fractured ribs, concussion. Doctors said I'd be in the hospital for at least six weeks, then rehab after that.



My sister is 25. She lives two hours away and has been struggling financially since she dropped out of college. When I got hurt, she called crying saying she felt terrible and wanted to help. Asked if she could stay at my place to be closer to the hospital so she could visit me every day.



I said yes. Gave her my spare key. Told her to make herself at home, just keep the place clean and maybe water my plants.



First week she visited three times. Second week, twice. After that, nothing for almost a month.



I kept texting asking when she was coming by. She'd say she was busy, she'd come soon, she was dealing with stuff. Meanwhile other family members and friends were visiting regularly and they started mentioning they'd seen cars at my house at weird hours. My neighbor actually called me in the hospital to ask if I knew there were people coming and going at all hours.



I called my sister. Asked what was going on. She said she had a few friends over once or twice, no big deal. I said the neighbor made it sound like more than that. She got defensive and said the neighbor was exaggerating, that I was being paranoid.



I got discharged last week. My sister knew I was coming home. She texted saying she'd cleaned everything up and it looked great.



I walked in and almost threw up. The smell hit me first. Stale beer, cigarettes, something worse I couldn't identify. There were stains on my couch. My coffee table had burn marks. The carpet in the living room was trashed. My kitchen looked like a frat house. Someone had punched a hole in the wall of the guest bedroom.



My TV was gone. My laptop was gone. A bunch of other stuff I couldn't even inventory yet because I was too shocked.



I called my sister immediately. She didn't answer. I texted her photos. She called back an hour later and said okay, things got a little out of hand but it wasn't her fault. That she'd had some people over and they'd invited other people and it got bigger than she expected.



I asked how many times. She said a few. I asked what a few meant. She finally admitted she'd been throwing parties almost every weekend for the past month and a half. Said she was lonely and stressed about me being in the hospital and needed to blow off steam.



I asked about my missing stuff. She said some things might have gotten stolen but she didn't know who took what. I asked if she knew the people at these parties. She said some of them, but a lot were friends of friends.



I lost it. Told her she let strangers into my house, trash the place, and steal my stuff while I was laid up in a hospital bed. She started crying, said she was sorry, that she didn't mean for it to get this bad. I said she needed to pay to fix everything and replace what was stolen.



She said she didn't have that kind of money. I got estimates. Professional cleaning and carpet replacement alone is $3000. The TV and laptop are another $2000. The wall repair is $400. I'm still finding broken and missing things.



I told her she had two weeks to come up with at least the cleaning costs or I'd take her to small claims court. She said that was insane, that I was being cruel when she was just trying to cope with a hard situation. I said she was supposed to be helping ME, not throwing ragers in my house.



She called our parents. They called me saying I was being too hard on her, that she made a mistake but she's young and didn't know it would get that bad. My mom said I should just file an insurance claim and let it go. I said my insurance won't cover this and even if it did, my rates would go up. My dad said family doesn't sue family and I need to forgive and move on.



My sister has been posting on social media about how she's being attacked for making one mistake, how her own family won't support her when she's struggling. Her friends are commenting saying I'm heartless for going after her legally.



But I'm still in physical therapy. I'm out of work. I had to hire cleaners because I physically can't do the work myself. My house was supposed to be my safe space to recover and instead it's destroyed.



Some friends say I should pursue it legally. Others say it's not worth destroying my relationship with my sister over money and property. My aunt offered to mediate but my sister won't even talk to me now unless I agree to drop the money demands.



The two week deadline is tomorrow. I have the small claims paperwork ready to file. But my whole family is telling me not to do it.



Should I just eat the costs and try to move past this? Am I being too harsh on her? AITAH?",3,1763978488.0,FoundandExpose,1,0.8,False

The tension. The pacing. The feeling that everything is about to explode. It feels terrifyingly real. It feels like a high-stakes thriller where the hero (you) is trapped in a room with a ticking bomb.

But that’s not what’s happening.

I realized something yesterday that changed the channel for me forever.

You aren't the person in the thriller.
**You are the Network Executive sitting in the control booth.**

And that ""craving""? That’s not a bomb. That is a desperate, sweaty Reality TV Producer named **Steve**.

Steve is in charge of a show called *""The addict.""* It’s a terrible show. It’s been running for years. The ratings are tanking because you decided to quit watching. And Steve is freaking out. He needs his ratings (dopamine) back, or he’s going to get cancelled.

So, look at what Steve is doing right now inside your brain.

He is frantically pulling every cheap trick in the book to manufacture drama.

*   **The Lighting:** Notice how the world feels a little darker, a little grayer? That’s Steve dimming the lights in post-production to set a ""mood.""
*   **The Soundtrack:** That anxious hum in your chest? That’s Steve blasting a royalty-free track called *'Approaching Doom_v4.mp3'* over the studio speakers.
*   **The Script:** That voice telling you ""Just one won't hurt""? That’s Steve holding up a cue card for you to read because he thinks a tragic relapse arc is what the audience wants.

He is running around the set, sweating through his headset, screaming at the editors: *""CUE THE ANXIETY! ZOOM IN ON THE ITCHY FEELING! MAKE HIM THINK HE'S ANGRY! WE NEED TEARS, PEOPLE! WE NEED DRAMA!""*

And you?

You’re just sitting up there in the glass booth, holding a lukewarm coffee, watching this little guy have a meltdown.

You can see the boom mic dipping into the frame. You can see the fake walls shaking. You can see that the ""monster"" is just an intern in a rubber suit.

It’s not scary anymore. It’s just... low budget.

So, don't get down on the stage and argue with Steve. Don't try to rewrite the script.

Just lean into the microphone so your voice booms over the whole set.

**""Steve. Ideally, we’d like to pivot to a lifestyle cooking show. Or maybe a gardening docu-series. This drama is getting stale.""**

Then, sit back.
Watch him scramble.
Watch him try to play the scary music again.

And just **change the channel.**

The atmosphere is raw, claustrophobic, and realistic—like a diary entry written in panic. The narrator doubts their sanity but records every detail: the sulfur smell, the bleeding digits, the shadows forming horns.  
The scratching intensifies. The walls themselves seem alive, pulsing with chants. The narrator translates the words in their head: “We open the gate. We feed the hour. We summon the master.” They describe the sensation of being pinned to the bed, the paralysis, and the figures emerging from the corners. The realism is heightened by mundane details—the carpet fibers, the broken phone charger—contrasted with impossible phenomena.  The narrator feels something enter them—not possession, but occupation. Their thoughts are hijacked. They scream, but the sound comes out backwards. Their voice becomes a hymn praising a name they’ve never spoken. The figures bow, and the ceiling splits open to reveal a sky of black fire. Constellations rearrange into sigils. The narrator realizes their room is now an altar.

The frozen digits bleed into letters: DEVIL. The narrator describes the horror of seeing time itself rewritten. They realize the witching hour isn’t superstition—it’s a contract. Every night at 3:00 AM, the ritual repeats. The narrator documents each occurrence, noting how the voices grow louder, the shadows thicker, the occupation

The narrator tries to resist. They set alarms, drink coffee, pray. None of it works. At 3:00 AM, the clock bleeds again. This time, the figures bring offerings—bones, ash, blood not from the narrator but from nowhere. The narrator describes the ritual in detail, the way the shadows carve symbols into the walls, the way the ceiling opens wider.  

The narrator begins to lose track of reality. They see sigils burned into their skin. They hear voices during the day. They describe the sensation of being watched constantly, even in sunlight. At 3:00 AM, the ritual escalates: the figures chant louder, the sky burns brighter, and something vast begins to descend.  

The narrator describes the descent of a winged, horned entity from the abyss above. They cannot look directly at it without their eyes bleeding. They describe its presence as a vibration that shakes the bones of the house. The entity speaks not in words but in thoughts: “You woke at the hour. You are chosen. You will not leave.”  

The narrator realizes they are bound to the ritual. They describe the sensation of signing a contract without pen or paper—just blood and thought. They recount visions of past victims, centuries of souls consumed at 3:00 AM. They realize the witching hour is not a superstition but a mechanism, a feeding ritual that sustains something vast and satanic. 

The narrator describes visions of the world ending. Cities burning, oceans boiling, skies splitting into sigils. They realize the ritual is not personal—it’s global. Every witching hour, across the world, souls are consumed, contracts signed, gates opened. The apocalypse is not sudden but cumulative, built hour by hour, ritual by ritual.  

The narrator reaches the tenth night. They describe the ritual in full detail: the chanting, the bleeding clock, the descent of the entity. This time, the gate does not close at 3:01.

Salaam / Hello everyone,
I’m an Indian expat currently in Doha.
Back in India I worked at ABB as a Hardware Design Engineer for ~2 years. My main responsibilities were:
Cabinet & panel hardware design (control panels, MCCs, PLC/DCS cabinets)
Preparing GA drawings, wiring diagrams, BOMs, loop diagrams in AutoCAD & EPLAN
Component selection, loop checks, FAT/SAT support
Worked on projects for oil & gas, power, and process industries
I’m now actively looking to continue in the same field here in Qatar – any project-based (6–12+ months) or full-time roles in automation, control systems hardware design, panel engineering, instrumentation design, EPC, etc. would be perfect.

Does anyone here work in hardware design / control panel engineering / automation in Doha and can spare a referral or advice?
Also very open to recruiter recommendations that actually place people in this niche.
Happy to share my CV privately and meet for coffee as a thank you! ☕
Thanks a lot in advance

I’ve pulled together a Germany winter road trip that links up some really fun cities between Cologne and Berlin. Think Christmas markets, cosy bars, Baltic Sea walks in a big coat and lots of chances to refuel on currywurst and pastries.

🗺️ **Full guide + free map here:**  
Link and free map: [https://thetraveltinker.com/road-trip/germany-winter-road-trip/](https://thetraveltinker.com/road-trip/germany-winter-road-trip/)  
(more detail, suggested timings, food ideas, playlist + Google My Map)

# Route overview

**Cologne → Düsseldorf → Bremen → Hamburg → Rostock → Berlin**  
Approx. 860 km / 535 miles  
Ideal timeframe: **7–10 days**

Short driving days, all major roads, and every stop has decent public transport if you want to park the car and forget about it for a bit.

# Route in more detail

**Cologne**

* Cathedral views and riverside walks
* Multiple Christmas markets you can walk between
* Chocolate Museum for a warm indoor afternoon
* Thermal spa time by the Rhine

**Düsseldorf**

* Shopping on Königsallee
* Altstadt brewery crawl with tiny Altbier glasses
* MedienHafen for modern architecture and harbour views
* Covered food market at Carlsplatz for lunch

**Bremen**

* Schnoor quarter: tiny old lanes, crooked houses, little cafés
* The Town Musicians statue and quirky “Spuckstein” stone
* Universum science museum in a weird spaceship-style building
* Winter markets along the river with fire bowls and mead vibes

**Hamburg**

* Brick warehouses of Speicherstadt and the port
* Elbphilharmonie viewing deck over the harbour
* Heated winter harbour / canal cruises
* Franzbrötchen (cinnamon pastry) + coffee between walks

**Rostock & Baltic Sea**

* Old town squares, Gothic brick churches, tram system that’s easy to use
* One of the bigger Christmas markets in northern Germany
* Day trip to Warnemünde for a cold-but-beautiful Baltic beach walk and Fischbrötchen

**Berlin**

* Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag area, Museum Island etc
* East Side Gallery (murals on the old Wall)
* Neighbourhood wandering in Kreuzberg, Neukölln, Prenzlauer Berg
* Loads of Christmas markets from traditional to indie

# Driving & timing

* I’d keep driving days to **3–4 hours max** in winter so you arrive in time for daylight wandering and a market or pub in the evening.
* Late November to around 23 December is the sweet spot if you want Christmas markets.
* January–February is colder and quieter, better for people who care more about city stuff than festive stalls.

🔹 **Tinker’s Tip:** Park up and use public transport in Hamburg and Berlin. It is cheap, frequent and much less stressful than driving across town in the dark looking for parking.

# Local food to hunt down

* **Cologne:** Kölsch beer, “Himmel un Ääd” (potato, apple sauce, sausage)
* **Düsseldorf:** Altbier, Sauerbraten with red cabbage
* **Bremen:** Knipp (local sausage dish), riverside fish
* **Hamburg:** Fischbrötchen and Franzbrötchen
* **Rostock/Baltic:** Kale with sausage, more seafood
* **Berlin:** Currywurst, döner, and a ridiculous amount of street food

# Winter road trip basics

* Winter or all-season tyres with the snowflake symbol
* Ice scraper, de-icer, small brush for snow
* High-vis vest, warning triangle, first aid kit
* Offline maps downloaded, phone mount, in-car charger
* Proper layers, waterproof shoes, hat, scarf, gloves

# Quick FAQs

**Do I need a car for this?**  
You can do the exact route by train if you prefer. All stops are well connected. The car just gives you more flexibility for detours and lazy starts.

**What about driving in winter as a visitor?**  
Roads are well maintained, just drive to conditions, leave extra distance and avoid pushing it if it is icy or snowing heavily.

**Language barrier?**  
You’ll be fine with English in cities. A few phrases (*Hallo*, *Danke*, *Tschüss*) are appreciated and make ordering glühwein slightly more fun.

**Is 7 days enough?**  
Yes, but it is brisk. Ten days feels “just right” if you like slow mornings, detours and more time in Hamburg and Berlin.

If anyone’s done a similar Cologne–Berlin winter run (by car or train), what would you add or swap out? And if you want the full breakdown plus free Google My Map, it’s here:

Hi. A bit of context is needed for this to make sense. So me, my mom and my dad used to live in a house outside the city (suburban kind of place) but a year ago, my dad got accepted for a job in the US, so we started to plan our move. It has been a long process but now my dad is in the U.S and he's setting stuff up for me and my mom to come there. This summer my mom was also accepted for a job in the same city. So now it's just me and my mom and we moved into a small apartment in the city (not in the U.S) because our contract for the house ended. 

I graduated highschool this year, and am waiting to be accepted by a university in the U.S and waiting for my visa, so I've been in the apartment a lot, home alone (Im 18F). I go out but not  a lot. 

 We've been in this apartment for 2 and a half months and about 2 weeks after we moved in I started to notice that the guy in the apartment across from us was looking at us. He's some old dude so I thought maybe he was just taking a look because ""oh look new people in that apartment building!"". But he wasn't just looking he was CONSINSTENTLY staring at us over multiple days. I asked my mom ""is it just me or is that guy always looking at us?"" and she knew immediately what I was talking about. We thought maybe we were overreacting because we've never really lived in the city and thought maybe it was normal that people just stare. 

But it started to get really uncomfortable. Me and my mom would just  be sitting in the living room in the evening, watching a series and I would see this guy STARING at us. Like no shame whatsoever. Even when he saw us noticing him, he didn't look away. He KEPT staring. I was so uncomfortable so we started to lower the blinds every night while we sat in the living room. This was a pretty good solution because now we could just sit in  peace. But now, when I'm alone during the day (while my mom is at work), we have the blinds open because we never had a problem with this guy looking through the window during the day. 

 But about a week ago I started to notice him in the morning staring at me while I was making coffee in the kitchen. I am so fucking pissed off and uncomfortable. I just want to be able to keep the blinds open during the day and not feel like I need to hide when I make some damn coffee or just want to sit in the living room. 

A few weeks ago my friend visited and I told him about the creepy guy. At first he thought maybe I was overreacting but then I pointed out the guy to him once he started staring and my friend said that it was definetely creepy. My friend even just straight up got up and stared at him back lol but this creepy fucker didn't even bat an eye. 

Am I overreacting?? I am really uncomfortable and really want to do something about this. Im tired of creeps getting away with creepy shit. Maybe this is normal?? Do people in the city just do this? We even started to notice ANOTHER guy in the apartment building next to The Creep staring at us. ",3,1763977295.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

1p5ct9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycle/comments/1p5ct9a/whats_your_best_motorcycle_riding_hack_post_a/,What's your best motorcycle riding hack? Post a picture of your bike :),"Well here are my cents:

1、Loosen your grip on the bars. You need enough to steer the bike, not choke the chicken. It’s going to lessen the possibility of the dreaded “tank slapper.” If you can’t flap your arms, you’re holding on too tight. Practice this in the straights. It will let you know exactly how much pressure you need to apply. Learn that feel. Intimately. Road imperfections and bumps won’t be nearly as jarring once you do.

**2、Non-latex gloves**. Throw a couple pairs in your pocket. You’ll barely notice them, but if it gets cold(er) during your ride, they’ll give at least 10–15 degrees of warmth to make it to where you’re going without numb fingers. (It’s also a much better solution that putting your hands on your exhaust pipe. *Yes, that will work in a pinch, but it also shortens the lifespan of your gloves and good ones aren’t cheap.*)

3、If you’re going to pass a semi/bus/large vehicle, wave a hand into the lane you plan to switch over into…it’s not much, but they’ll appreciate it and give you the requisite space to get your boogie on. This helps in two ways—one, it helps to let them know where you intend to go, and it also lets you know that if you are *unable to do so*—don’t. They can’t stop half as fast as you can. If you don’t have time to perform this simple maneuver, don’t change lanes. You’ve been warned.

4、Carry a small repair kit. Don’t bring the entire garage, but just enough to tweak what you need to if trouble strikes.

5、Rain gear. Carry it, and at a minimum, rain pants. Rain sucks. Riding wet **and** cold is particularly miserable. If you’re wearing gear it’s at least water resistant. Leather works unless it’s a straight downpour. Again, I’m talking a few ounces of extra weight here and not much bulk.

6、Murdered out (all black) looks cool, but *try* make sure that you’re visible at all times. Whether you do that with colors that pop, reflective piping, strips, whatever. Make sure people **see** you. *I guarantee they’re not paying attention either way*, so the best bet for you is to make sure they do.

7、If filtering (moving to the front of traffic at a stop) is an available option, **do it**. It’s just a little more protection against someone slamming into the back of your bike.

8、Use your rear brake in slow-moving traffic. Yeah, I know they told you to do that in your MSF class (you **did** take it, *right*???) but it works wonders in stop-and-go/city traffic. Learn how to feather that rear brake and you’ll be glad you did. It even works on bikes that don’t have rider aids.

9、If you’re tired. Stop. Just stop. Grab a cup of coffee. Warm up (or cool off), relax, whatever you need to do. Drivers can afford (not really) a second or two of inattention, you cannot. Make it safely.

10、If you’re going to ride around with your visor up, know that insects will fly into your helmet. It’s definitely a thing. Be prepared.",3,1763977133.0,motorcycle,5,1.0,False

As a proper coffee addict, the first thing I needed was finding a solid coffee place - you know, that spot where you can just go and hang with friends regularly. So I went on a mission to find the best cafes in Raipur and the best coffee places in Raipur where I could become a regular.


And here’s my experience so far:

    ⁃    Daily Dose : Coffee is genuinely superb. Not “Raipur good”, but actually good-good. Food is solid, try their pizzas and smoothie bowls. Vibes are good, and the crowd is always nice. i would say the best in raipur. And i’ve become a regular here

    ⁃    1DM: coffee is good, and they have many branches which is convenient. Food is bad, like not even average. Crowd is okayish. But this is the only place where they have good macha try their hazelnut macha its 10/10

    ⁃    Sabr: Spanish latte is very good here. Vietnamese coffees are surprisingly nice. Food is a hit or miss depends on the day. Crowd is nice, peaceful, good ambience

    ⁃    Tan Coffee: Coffee is mid, food is mid, crowd is mid. Nothing terrible, nothing great

    ⁃    MOC: Used to be good earlier. but Now? Declined hard. Food meh, coffee meh, service pathetic. Not worth it (for me at least)


Also I’ve started appreciating the smoking area sections that many Raipur cafes now have.I kinda like the vibe there ngl. Pro tip for the single guys: Always carry a lighter with you. I've managed to land 2 dates at daily dose just by having a lighter ready at the right moment and playing my cards right lol. Works like a charm if you know what you're doing 😂


So that’s my honest take on the best cafes and coffee places in Raipur after 9 months of being back. If you guys have any other good coffee places in raipur I should check out like hidden gems, new openings, underrated cafes drop them here.",6,1763976766.0,Raipur,0,0.87,False

She’s always had this edgy, stone-faced, reserved vibe, very put-together, the type who rarely shows emotion. But over time I started noticing things that didn’t match how detached she usually acts:


      •  We’ve shared several prolonged eye contacts

	•	I’ve caught her looking at me for long periods when she thought I wasn’t paying attention (like in a small coffee shop, while waiting for the elevator, while i was talking to my friends)

	•	In our open-space class, she always seemed to gravitate toward me, even when her friends were standing elsewhere. While she was standing in front of me, I noticed her glancing at me constantly, looking away fast when I looked up, and lifting her head at the sound of my voice
 
	•	One time, she chose a spot literally one step away from my back even though there was plenty of space near. We stayed like that for a couple of hours

	•	She dropped her stuff twice in a row right in front of me, which felt out of character because she usually seems pretty composed and smooth 

	•	She acted awkwardly when I tried greeting her after another moment of eye contact. She looked back at me, didn’t say anything, but kept glancing for 3 hours straight afterward

     •  There was also a cute, probably neutral moment in the elevator when she pressed the button for me a second after I forgot to do it

After all of that, I decided to dm her a simple, casual academic question. It’s been 5 days and she never opened it, left on delivered. She’s active in a study group chat though.

I feel really confused and honestly a bit hurt. Do those signs look like she was interested at all? I can’t tell if I completely misread everything or if she just panicked

i asked him for his instagram and he is very very into art (he mentioned it on his profile) and all his posts are about it, meanwhile i don’t have a hobby i am strongly into like he does because i jump from hobby to hobby and haven’t had one i have felt strongly for a while, except for listening to music, which i can hardly share opinions on except for “it sounds good”. i have so many interests that i procrastinate getting into.. i have been thinking about it for so long, how we dont share this hobby and that my interests are rather shallow, and how nervous i am because i have never dated, and i keep on thinking about all the hobbies i said i would get into/interests i have that i wanted to further explore (some video games i wanted to buy, reading more, watching more anime). im scared it will just be awkward

Halfway through, she pauses, looks at me and says:
“Why do you keep scanning the room every few minutes? Are you… evaluating something?”

And I had no idea how to explain that this is just a habit now.
Some people bite nails.
Some twirl hair.
I… apparently keep track of exits, suspicious noises, and the guy at the next table who keeps checking his phone like he’s waiting for a secret signal.
(It turned out he was just waiting for his Zomato order.)

She laughed and said,
“You don’t look tense, but your eyes are doing a full PowerPoint presentation.”

Honestly, that was the moment I realised:
maybe I’ve been trained by life, experience, and way too much news consumption to always expect plot twists.

Hey Travel Trotters! If you're dreaming of your next big adventure, let me tell you about my recent cruise on the Royal Caribbean Icon of the Seas. Seriously, this wasn't just a cruise; it was like sailing on a whole new planet, a literal floating city of fun, food, and thrills! I’ve been on cruises before, but this 7-day journey from Miami to Mexico, Honduras, and the Bahamas was hands down the BEST.

**Arrival & Miami Vibes ☀️**
We kicked off in Miami, and seeing the Icon of the Seas for the first time was jaw-dropping. It's MASSIVE! Think roller coaster-like water slides visible from the dock and balconies stacked to the sky. Boarding was super smooth – quick baggage drop, passport check (Philippine passport holders, only US visa was checked for these stops!), and then you're on board. First stop? Finding our muster station, then straight to exploring the wild architecture of 'The Pearl' staircase and grabbing a coffee from a friendly Filipino barista at Starbucks. After settling into our Ocean View Balcony, dinner at Windjammer and a comedy juggling show capped off an epic first day.

**Sea Day: Seven Neighborhoods of Pure Bliss! 🏝️🎢**
Day 2 was a sea day, and wow, did we need it to explore! This ship isn't just big; it's organized into distinct ""neighborhoods."" Imagine:
*   **Chill Island:** Sun, pools, and pure relaxation. 💦
*   **Central Park:** A tranquil ""zen garden"" with real plants and soft music. 🌳
*   **Thrill Island:** Home to Category 6 Waterpark – the largest at sea! Slides like Frightening Bolt had us screaming (in a good way!). 😱
*   **Surfside:** Perfect for families, with a carousel, splash zones, and free hotdogs/soft-serve! 🍦
*   **The Hideaway:** An adults-only infinity pool with insane views and hip-hop vibes. So cool!

Mini-golf, rock climbing, ice skating shows, escape rooms – you name it, it's probably there.

**Mexico & Honduras Adventures! 🇲🇽🇭🇳**
Our first port was Puerto Costa Maya, Mexico. We chose to chill in the port area, which is like its own mini-destination with shops, pools, and live music. Pro tip: Stick to the ship's food; our port quesadilla was a letdown. 😅

Day 4 took us to Roatán, Honduras, a lush paradise! We booked the ""Ultimate Extreme Adventure Combo"" – 11 ziplines through dense jungle, including some epic ""SUPERMAN-style"" descents, followed by wobbly hanging bridges with breathtaking rainforest views. It was a 4-5 hour adrenaline rush! Back on board, El Loco Fresh (taco bar) hit the spot. 🌮

**Cozumel & Chichén Itzá: A Wonder of the World! 🗿**
Waking up in Cozumel, Mexico, we embarked on an excursion to the ancient Chichén Itzá ruins. It was a journey: ferry to Playa del Carmen, then a shuttle inland. Our guide, Carlos, made the history come alive. Be warned: they charge for cameras (not phones!), and no selfie sticks or tripods allowed. Standing before that majestic pyramid, despite the brutal sun and pushy vendors, was absolutely jaw-dropping. A long but incredibly worthwhile day! ✨

**Sea Day & Foodie Paradise 🍽️**
Another sea day meant more exploration and, importantly, FOOD! With over 20 dining venues (11 complimentary!), you'll never go hungry.
*   **Included:** Main Dining Room, Windjammer buffet, AquaDome Market (five stalls!), Surfside Eatery, Sorrento’s Pizza (late-night savior!), El Loco Fresh, Pearl Café, and more.
*   **Specialty (extra cost, totally worth it!):** We tried Hooked Seafood and it was phenomenal – surf and turf, Captain’s Platter, divine desserts. Other options include Chops Grille (steak), Giovanni’s (Italian), Izumi (Hibachi), and the fancy Empire Supper Club.

The ice skating show ""Once Upon a Time: The King’s Royal Ball"" was also a dazzling spectacle! ⛸️

**Perfect Day at CocoCay, Bahamas! 🇧🇸🥳**
Our last stop was Royal Caribbean’s private island, CocoCay – and they named it perfectly!
*   **Thrill Waterpark:** We pre-booked tickets and conquered Daredevil’s Peak (tallest waterslide in North America!), Dueling Demons, and the terrifyingly magnificent Slingshot! Get to Daredevil's Peak first to beat the lines. 🎢💦
*   **Chill Island:** If thrills aren't your thing, the white sand beaches and calm waters here are pure bliss, with free loungers and complimentary meals at Skipper's Grill.

The day ended with an incredible Aqua Theater show on the ship – high dives, acrobatics, and dramatic lighting. What a finale!

**Farewell Miami 👋**
Disembarkation back in Miami was swift and seamless, thanks to automated gates. We left with full hearts, unforgettable memories, and already dreaming of our next cruise! If you're considering the Icon of the Seas, stop thinking and just BOOK IT. You won't regret it!

But, when you get to know me, I'm the ultimate unhinged chaos gremlin, like the skaven from Warhammer fantasy. I also love cats and dogs (I will always have at least one or the other if not both). I'm the tallest of the tall at 5'8"", and if someone if taller then that then I'm going to steal their femur and attach it to mine to be taller before selling their kneecaps on the black market. Unless you're cute. Then get a pass. And, I'm on the skinnier side. But, despite looking like I'm from The Shire, I could pass a CFT and PFT before I got hurt. So, don't let my size fool you, I am the ultimate gremlin despite being built like a xenomorph that was drawn by a five year old. I have brownish hair, and one of my eyes is kind of blue while the other is kind of grey. There's other colours in each, because my eyes can't make up theirs minds. I'm also admittedly quite clingy. Not at first, but as time goes on, especially if I realize the relationship is going to work, I get a bit clingy. But, thats what conversations and boundaries are for. If I'm too clingy for my partner or vice versa, we can work things out first and establish whether or not the clinginess is too much.


What I'm looking for:
- A long term partner/hopefully my life partner
- A fellow gremlin to cause chaos with
- Emotionally intelligent
- Some common interest
- Some interest that we don't have in common, because sometimes uncommon ground is just as good as common ground. 
- Preferably from a different culture than my own. I'm from the U.S, and I prefer learning/experiencing about other cultures and religions
- Someone alright with starting things as a long distance relationship online first and working things out from there with the goal of moving in together when we are both ready.

I do quite enjoy/prefer interracial relationships, not for a fetish reason, but because they just seem so cute. And, in every one that I've been in there's been such interesting differences that me see the world differently. Every day I got to see things in a different light. (Like when my ex and I would play customer service tag when they'd tell her they don't have something but mysteriously have it for me.) But, this is not a requirement. I'm not picky. You could be from outer space and that would be fine. Or you could be a blonde woman who drank way too much pumpkin spice coffee, and has now turned into a pumpkin headed horror beyond my comprehension. Being at least a little goofy is all I need.

Big disclaimer here: I'm not Christian, nor do I plan on converting. And, I don't plan in converting you to my religion either. So, religious differences are not only accepted, they are preferred.

Also, if we hit it off, things go well, but you're on the other end of the world, we'll work it out. Planes exist, and I'd know because they're a hyperfixation of mine. So, distance shouldn't be too much of an issue. And, a key word in what I'm looking for is partner. I want to not just have a cute romantic time, that's all well and good. But, I want to have a true partnership. Not looking for who wears the pants. More like us awkwardly sharing the same metaphorical pants with a panties to both of us. I want to work out problems together and tackle life together. A 50/50 partnership. 

So, if this far too long post strikes your fancy, shoot me a message! Just be forewarned, if you asks for my hyperfixations I'll give you a list. But, I will not be held responsible for the absolute elder scrolls of text you'll get if you ask about a specific one.",1,1763976147.0,NerdDating,0,1.0,False

🌟 Eating Well on Weight-Loss Medication: A Simple Guide for Your Week
When you’re on weight-loss medication, food can feel complicated. Some days you’re not hungry at all, and other days your appetite suddenly returns. That’s completely normal — and it’s exactly why having simple, gentle, easy-to-digest meals ready to go can make your week so much easier.

The goal isn’t to “eat as little as possible,” but to fuel your body in a way that supports your medication, protects your digestion, and keeps your energy steady. The image above highlights balanced, realistic meal options that work beautifully for people with reduced appetite.

Here’s how to use these meals to support your week:

🥣 1. Start Your Day With Gentle Energy
Breakfast doesn’t need to be heavy — in fact, it shouldn’t be.
Think protein + hydration, with foods that are soft, simple, and stomach-friendly:

Greek yoghurt with berries

A small latte or milky coffee

Smooth scrambled eggs

Overnight oats

A protein smoothie

These options help keep nausea at bay and give your metabolism something to work with, without overwhelming your stomach early in the day.

🍽️ 2. Choose Light but Protein-Focused Lunches
Midday meals are where people on medication often struggle. If appetite is low, keep lunch:

✔ Soft
✔ Easy to chew
✔ High in protein
✔ Not too oily or spicy

Great examples include:

Chicken, tuna, or egg salad with light mayo

Soup with added protein (beans, lentils, shredded chicken)

Half a wrap with lean protein

Cottage cheese with fruit

A small sushi portion

High-protein yoghurt + a banana

Protein helps maintain muscle mass while supporting steady weight loss.

🍲 3. Keep Dinners Balanced and Comfortable
Evening meals should be satisfying but not too rich. Aim for:

Lean protein

Cooked vegetables (not raw)

Soft carbs like rice, baked potato, or noodles

Some easy options:

Baked salmon with green beans

Stir-fry with chicken and veg

Turkey mince chilli

Omelette with cooked veggies

Slow-cooker stews

These foods are gentle on digestion and help prevent nighttime nausea.

💧 4. Hydration Is Key
One of the biggest reasons people feel unwell on medication is simply dehydration.
Keep a bottle with you and sip throughout the day — even when you’re not thirsty.

🧘‍♀️ 5. Eat Slowly & Stop Early
You’ll feel full faster while on medication.
Don’t push past the first sign of fullness — this is what causes nausea, discomfort, and sometimes vomiting.

❤️ 6. Be Kind to Yourself
This journey is not about perfection.
Some days you’ll manage three meals; other days you’ll only manage one and a half. That’s normal.

The meals in the image are designed to give you:

✔ Gentle nourishment
✔ Easy, realistic options
✔ Balanced portions
✔ Foods that support your medication, not fight it

1p5cgxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SMG4/comments/1p5cgxb/smg4_season_13_2023_unexpectedly_a_masterpiece/,SMG4 season 13 (2023). Unexpectedly a Masterpiece.,"This isn’t a joke. I genuinely think season 13 is a Masterpiece. Its not the best SMG4 season, but after 4 seasons of the show getting worse, worse arcs, worse characters, worse story’s and worse humour, SMG4 Season 13 changed everything in the right way, after hitting rock BOTTOM, and Also Began the SMG4 “Resonance Era”. Or the “New Era”, because as of October 2^(nd) 2025, this is the newest SMG4 era, we got 3 mini arcs and 3 Movies…technically, but with that, lets dive into SMG4 season 13.

***EDITING/SOUNDTRACK***

For some reason, season 13s soundtrack, is amazing. During the whole season, I heard so many old song from the classic season 1-4 era here, and it was beautiful hearing them again, the best part from this was, the fact in “Mario VS Skibidi Toilet” where Mario sings the first part of Scatman’s song  “scatman ski-ba-bop-ba-dop-bop” which was great, as it was the first time it had been, heard since 2016. So many more ones can be heard as well, and its great I love it. Its probably the best soundtrack since season 6. Something that actually isn’t the best in season 13 (one of the only downsides) is the editing. Now, season 12 wasn’t the best as well, but I think it looked better than this season. Not to say it doesn’t have its moments, the movies, and trailers look pretty good, but outside of that, this season is more bland than all the other seasons, and I don’t really like how this season looks to others. A definite downgrade. Another thing in the editing is that SMG3, SMG4, Meggy, Boopkins and Tari all got remasterd models. For SMG3,4 Boopkins, they where remasterd cuse there old models where hated, and I like these new ones, they look much better than the only ones, but Recolour SMG4 and SMG3 are the best SMG3 and SMG4. Meggys and taris where done cuse the old models where OLD, and by that point, if most is remasterd, why not do them all!

***THE EPISODE STYLE***

The episode style is more like the other 2 seasons that came before it. You got normal Episodes, Stuipd Mario episodes, If Mario was Episodes, trailers, movies and WOTFI’S, mini Arc episodes, but no long Arc episodes, as this season is the first since season 7 not to have an arc, but instead, it has an ongoing story line that I will be getting into. This season also marked the last time for 2 years that Stupid Mario Episodes and If Mario episodes were done, but we got Remastered 64 videos. They where old SMG4 vids (season 1- season 7) that have been remastered up to modern day YouTube guidelines and animation up to modern standards. But unlike season 12, where many episodes had good plots, season 13 at times seems to be the opposite, but they end up being brilliant. I know many people aren’t going to like this, but I really like Mario VS Skibidi Toilet, despite the fact its got a main characters that from brainrot. ANOTHER RTHING THAT Season 13 did, brilliantly is its humor. This felt like the humor from season 5-8, as every episode had great moments of laugh. One of the best was “SMG3S Browser history” which is such a funny episode, I love it. Another thing that changed this year is where the gang hanged out. At first it was peach’s castle, but after it was destroyed, SMG4 bought the showgrounds and made a new castle there

***THE CHARACTERS. (who did stuff this season)***

This season keeps most of the cast we have seen from season 11 and 10, with some additions and losses. This season, we technically got Leggy, Meggy but…a gomba. No comment on this character as she doesn’t do to much in season 13, but I will have way more to say in season 14. We also got Mr Puzzles, who is the mastermind behind the Puzzle vision saga and the 3 mini Arcs in this season. I will say though, when he does appear, he is quite ominous and I like it, it makes you kinda exited about what he is going to do next, but that is also for season 14. But we did get a loss, and its one bigger than any other one: X did not appear at all this season. It sucks. I loved him, he was THE best cameo character, and one of the best overall, but now, he’s gone. FM is the same, outside of his cameo in the remastered 64 video, its good to see him, but not much to say as this is basically just 5 seconds of him. Now to talk about the main cast. Karen was…somewhat better this season. She wasn’t great…and kinda flopped between bad and good, but she was…kinda an improvement over season 12. What was a huge 180 was Meggy. She had been constantly worse since season 8, but this year, she was Amazing. Not to the season 7 or 8 standard, but WAY better than  the mid era from season 9-12. She’s not perfect. There are like 2 or 3 episodes where she’s annoying or a flat out don’t like her (mario and the tunnel of doom) but then there are other amazing episodes with her (ITS GOTTA BE PERFECT, Mario goes on a diet and Western Spaghetti) that out weight the bad or mid episodes. And Saiko, was also much better from season 12. She wasn’t great, but unlike last season where she was basically unbearable, she was MUCH better this season. She was not bad in a single episode. Shocking considering how bad she was from season 8-12, and there where even some good episodes. I really liked her in ITS GOTTA BE PERFECT, and Western Spaghetti, they where probably her best appearances, but there where 2 episodes where she was not the best, they where “Christmas wars” and “Mario Works at KFC”, but even then we was just mid. This is something that if it was season 12, or 9, would be amazing, but it definitely was FAR from her season 13 norm. Tari was also WAY better. After getting consecutively worse since season 8, season 13 was Taris best season. She was so great in so many episodes like Marios tunnel of doom, Mario goes to ohio and Western Spaghetti to name a few. I think her worse episode was “Christmas wars”. Ok quickly, the reason why you are going to see this pop up a lot is because I don’t like how the GANG was indecisive to either supporting SMG4 or SMG3, but the ending was good, so I don’t hate it. Melony, continued the form she had from season 11-12, if not just a bit better, as there where no episodes where I hated her, unlike season 11 and 12 which had 1 in season 11 and 2 in season 12, there where none, and the worst she got was “Christmas wars”. By hey! She did appear this season, and she got 2 main roles. This would be the last time until season 15, but hey! I really liked the 2 episodes she was a main in (The Very Safe & Legal SMG4 Show and Marios goes to death row), and its such a shame that this was the season where they truly started to wind down the amount of appearances she had, cuse she was one of the best characters this year. Mario, had a much better season this time after the horrible season 12 for his standards. He was much better and always a top 4 character, but there where still times where that “Man Child” mario crept in, and it prevented Mario from being at his peak from, but he was much better. SMG4 this season, was around, or slightly better than his season 12 counterpart, which is a good thing. I don’t really think he was bad in any episode and I loved SMG4 this year. One of his strongest. Bowser and Toad, despite this effectively being the swang song season, they where still great. I liked whenever I saw toad, and Bowser in the 2 episodes where he was a main, he was great, and I loved him. Swag and Chris where also great this year. I don’t know if it is just me, but it feels as if in season 13, Swag was like the main villain or antagonist, he appeard so many times, but that doesn’t matter. I LOVED him in season 13. Argubally his best season yet. He was prime :rude and always funny” I loved him chris was also great, but not as great as Swag. Bob was also great this year, he was defenitley a certified 100% badass in the episode “the infestation” and he continues to prove to me why he is one of the best. Boopkins was also great this season. Such a shame they made him more of a punching bag this season. He was be great when the writers chose to, or they can make him the butt of every joke. Same with Luigi. But luig was better! I loved that Luigi Is still so carring to Mario, and now in season 13, at times it feels almost as if they have gone and reversed season 1 roles. What I mean by that, was in season 1, luigi was a jerk to mario, but mario sometimes treated him nicely, but this season, it feels like all luigi does is try to please mario, but Mario just f\*\*ks him over even when it is not deserved. And last but CERTANLY not least…is SMG3, and im just going to say this: as of 2/10/2025, this is, by FAR SMG3S, BEST season ever.he was great every single episode, a jerk, hallarious,, great emotion and a good friend. I loved EVERY aspect that SMG3 got done in 2023. And him getting his café made it even better. WOTFI 2023 was the end of his “Hero Arc” beginning back in season 10, and ending in 2023, it was great to see how he changed. In season 10, he hated SMG4 and wanted him dead. Season 11, saw him tone down on hating SMG4. He still didn’t like him, but could stand him, and help when needed, and by WOTFI 2021, didn’t even mind hanging with him. Season 12 saw him getting most development in the revelations arc, where his evil greedy side came back and then overcoming those thoughts and being a better person, to season 13 where he helps SMG4, and shows many times he has his back, meanwhile having one of my most favourite rivralies because they always have had one. Loved SMG3 this season, I think COTS will be no surprise this time. Wario and Waluig where also pretty good this season, I liked them. Not much else to say because they rarely appeard and only wario got to be a main in MAR10 day!. This is also the season where the main cast started to go from everyone to basically most of the time Mario, SMG4, SMG3 and Meggy. This season also, unfortunately marked the final time SMG1 and SMG2 would have major roles, which sucks as they debut just 2 seasons ago, and are now basically gone. It sucks, but atleast they where still great.

***The episodes (the good the bad and the sum up)***

The episodes this year are SO much better than season 12. This season feels like its part of the golden era most of the time, that’s who great it is. The Sum up episode of Season 13 is SMG3's Browser History. The plot basically goes that SMG3 is looking at, some weird stuff, (probably gay stuff because Luigi obviously liked it), when SMG4 and Mario go into try and look at a meme SMG4 found, but SMG3 has the laptop, so he runs away with it, but after some events, he comes back, and SMG4 finally finds out what SMG3 was looking at, as does Meggy, Mario and Luigi, so SMG3 packs his bags and leaves. He goes to some alien place, where Swag and Chris are guarding it. In there SMG3 sees a thing that can wipe you’re memory (or parts, I don’t know), and he soon grabs it and escapes from the place with an Alien, goes back to SMG4S castle, where he wipes, SMG4S, Marios and Meggys memory (not Luigi but its probably cuse Luigi is not going to tell anyone). Now this is one of my favourite episodes of this year. This episode has so many funny moments I cant even count, I love seeing the aliens from season 10 and 12 that used doors on pingas’, and I just like the characters in this one. A great episode and a definite recommendation. The mid episode of Season 13 is Mario goes Coo Coo Crazy. This episode is about Mario playing  Pokémon and after beating it, he goes to capture a Pokémon, but is told by Swag that maybe he should capture human, which Mario does do, he basically captures all his friends except Bob and Tari, who somehow get him off playing the game with some other crocodile game I don’t know the name off, and when Mario drops the Pokémon balls and his friends get out, and then SMG4 and 3 slam Mario into a pokeball  and shoot him out of a cannon. This episode is a another really funny one. The humor in this one is spot on like when SMG4 shows Mario a plushie of Mario, and it looks awful. I also like how everyone acts in this one. Despite only helping for like 10 seconds, Meggy really shone when she told Mario to Calm down. The only real thing I dislike about this episode, is the fact that when Mario first wanted to play, they declined cuse of what happened in 2016, but heres the thing: the episode, Mario VS Pokemon go, which was the reason why they didn’t want him playing, is a pretty bad one. In Mario VS Pokemon go, he went around capturing people cuse he thought they where pokemon, but it turned out, that was just a game Mario was playing, he did not do that in real life. Why did they nt want Mario playing?  Did luigi see what game he was playing in 2016, and feard him actually doing it? It doesn’t really make sense, but hey! In the flash back I saw a Mario recolour, so…I guess it was worth it. The worst episode of Season 13 is SMG4 vs Content Farms. Its not bad, but it follows SMG4 finding out that some person has used his channel and made brainrot from it, and SMG4 and Mario go into that place and try to find out who’s behind it, and overall, outside of some funny moments, this episode is nothing special, but its not bad, which is really good. But with that, now its time to go onto the 3 mini arc we got this season…

***Mini Arc Number two: ITS GOTTA BE PREFECT Arc (2023) (5 episodes)***

Dam…this Mini arc was amazing. To be fair, all Mini arcs this season where brilliant and to the level of season 8’s arc, but maybe just slightly worse. But anyways, this Arc follows SMG3 getting popular, and MR Yeast to collabing with him, and then SMG4 asks SMG3 if he could get in a good word with MR Yeast, which does not work, so SMG4, thinking he’s fallen off, goes on a rampage, enslaving toads to pour out thousands of awful videos, and SMG3 actually find out what he has been doing and gets SMG4 Banned. However, soon after SMG4 is banned, SMG3 helps SMG4 get unbanned, cuse that’s how everyone has a comeback (im pretty sure that is what he said), and when SMG4 does get unbanned, he realises that people don’t want quantity, they want quality (should be taking down notes season 12). So SMG4 then goes to work on making the Prefect video. For the next 2 episodes in the arc, we see SMG4 slowly get worse and get more crazy, but during MAR10 day, the internet router gets destroyed and SMG4 completely looses it, and beats up basically everyone and tells them to leave him the  fuck alone, this deeply upsets Mario as he was going to award him with the best friend award. We then get an announcement on the SMG4 redesigns for SMG3,4,Meggy and Boopkins, before SMG3 (who was doing it because SMG4 was still working on the perfect video) realises that SMG4 is still working on the perfect video, but when he enters SMG4 rooms, its filled with junk and words on the walls and when SMG3 puts his hands on SMG4 and tells him to snap out of it, SMG4 looks back, and everything glitches…

***SMG4 MOVIE 4: ITS GOTTA BE PERFECT (2023)***

For starters, I love this movie. In my opinion, this is the best SMG4 episode/movie/video of all time and it’s just so amazing. I love it so the plot goes that SMG3 and Meggy discover SMG4 has become violently unhinged while a strange black, glyph-filled goop oozes from his room; the film then cuts to SMG4’s POV flashback explaining how it happened. After being reinstated on YouTube, SMG4 obsesses over making the perfect video, isolating himself, cancelling plans, and deteriorating mentally after repeated failures. During MAR10 Day he lashes out violently at guests, then orders a mysterious keyboard advertised by a TV-like persona; the keyboard dramatically increases his productivity while gradually possessing him. The keyboard’s fleshy, black goop takes control of SMG4 and begins corrupting Peach’s Castle. SMG3 and Meggy confront him, are attacked by the goop, and escape a sacrificial attempt. Outside, friends arrive to help but find the castle infected and must fight manifestations created from SMG4’s experiments. Mario, Meggy, and SMG3 search the castle, encountering disturbing messages, corrupted enemies, and manifestations of SMG4’s past designs. Emotional moments reveal SMG3’s empathy and the toll of YouTube pressure. They confront deformed versions of SMG3 and Beeg SMG4, solve meme-based obstacles, and battle the Demonic Goop. SMG4 briefly regains control after heartfelt appeals from SMG3, Mario, and Meggy, but the goop drags the castle into an abyss. The group coordinates attacks that sink the creature; the castle collapses. SMG4 and SMG3 complete the video together, SMG4 sacrifices to launch them out of the crater, and the USB and keyboard shut down. The crew mourns the permanent loss of Peach’s Castle and vows to rebuild. SMG4 apologizes and commits to making amends. The film closes on a chilling note: Princess Peach awakens to an eldritch eye at her window, scarring her, and endings the movie there. I love this move so much, where do it really begin? Well for starters, I think this movie looks great. Compared to the rest of the season, this movie looks beautiful, I love how it looks, the animation can be fluent, and like rag dolls, and the scenery, despite not being much, looks really good. This was the end of the line for Peach’s castle and in this single episode, we saw more of it this movie then in all of the 2020s. I also love the characters. I love bob, Saiko, Boopkins, Swag Chris, Meggy, SMG4, SMG3, Mario, all of them. Especially SMG3. The parts where he talks about knowing what SMG4 feels like is amazing, and him telling SMG4 no matter what, he will always have is back, is beautiful and amazing, and the end with then dangling off, was also Amazing from both SMG4 and SMG3, and when SMG4 says he promises to make everything right and get a new castle, is also great. I just love this, 10/10, the BEST of SMG4. But it isn’t fully perfect…well it is, but its why it happened. This Movie is great, but the fact that the caslte was completely destroyed, and the fact had they not interfered with the goop, it wouldn’t have been destroyed, and even if they did have to destroy it, why couldn’t they use concrete and just fill up the hole? Anyways, outside of that, I LOVE ITS GOTTA BE PERFECT, and it is (as of the 3^(rd) of October 2025), the best SMG4 video of all time. After this movie, SMG4 bought the show grounds and started to build the new castle, and these episodes is where the season HIT is stride, banger episode after BANGER episode, huge laugh out moments, and few mistakes, but then, we got another Arc, and another movie

***Mini Arc Number three: Western Spaghetti Arc (2023) (3 episodes)***

I love this Mini Arc as well, I think I should just get my opinions out of the way first, I think this arc is amazing, but I do think it is slighty worse than ITS GOTTA BE PERFECT, but not by much, but with that, lets dive into it. So the Arc has two plot points: the first is, is that Meggy wants to reunite with One Shot Wren, her idol, and the person that made Meggy…well Meggy, and Tari, wants to become a stronger person overall. Meggy find out that One Shot Wren is in a place called Western Spaghetti, so she, along with all her friends, go on the train and on there, some weird stuff happens, Tari is acting…off and at one point during a huge brawl, everyone just freezes, before all resetting back in place, and it ends with Meggy having a rest…

***SMG4 MOVIE 5: Western Spaghetti (2023)***

Dam…this movie, just like ITS GOTTA BE PERFECT, is a masterpiece, it is just slightly, oh so slightly worse than ITS GOTTA BE PERFECT and Revelations, but it is so close, but it is still amazing. So the plot goes that Meggy, Tari, and Mario arrive in the Wild West to meet Meggy’s idol, Oneshot Wren. They’re ambushed by a group called The Miscellaneous Seven, who turn out to be potato farmers warning that Wren is attacking the town of Western Spaghetti. Skeptical but concerned, the trio heads to investigate. Meanwhile, Sheriff SwagMaster6969696969 attempts to publicly execute Buffalo Bob, who escapes with Boopkins’ help. SMG3 tries to stop Bob with dynamite, but Bob deflects it, causing an explosion. Bob ominously promises to return with Wren, sparking fear. Meggy is appointed sheriff and tries to convince the town that Wren isn’t a villain. She trains her friends to defend themselves, but the group proves hilariously inept with weapons. Tari struggles emotionally, doubting her worth, but Meggy reassures her that strength comes in many forms. Meggy has a disturbing dream involving smoke bombs and unconscious friends. She wakes to find Tari missing and encounters deceased characters acting strangely. The world glitches, and Tari collapses. Meggy wakes in a hospital with Mario, discovering they’re trapped in a simulation created by Wren, who kidnapped them during their train ride. Wren offers Meggy a place in his digital world where he always wins, but she refuses. Her attempt to shoot him fails, confirming they’re still trapped. Meggy repeatedly wakes in a hotel room, caught in a loop where Wren hunts and shoots her. Her pleas for help go ignored, and she spirals into desperation, even threatening SMG4. Tari calms Meggy and reveals a hidden sanctuary she built inside the simulation. She shares a plan to defeat Wren and free everyone. Meggy confronts Wren again, but he mocks her and prepares to unleash an army. Her friends, now free from Wren’s control, join the fight. Despite overwhelming odds, Mario’s arrival inspires them. Swag distracts Wren, allowing Tari—disguised as Meggy—to shoot him. As the simulation collapses, Meggy and Tari lead everyone to safety. Meggy expresses sorrow over Wren’s downfall, wishing they could’ve been allies. Wren accepts his fate as the digital world crumbles around him. A few days after the intense events, Meggy coaches a young Inkling on the monkey bars, showing her nurturing side. Tari catches the child when she falls, and Meggy is relieved. To lighten the mood, Meggy initiates a playful Splattershot game, joined by Mario, bringing laughter and joy as they dodge his shots. Boopkins laments Meggy’s suffering, but Saiko reminds him that Meggy found what she truly needed. SMG4 reflects on the growth everyone has experienced. As the trio continues their fun, Mario accidentally damages the castle-in-progress, leaving SMG4 devastated—ending the chapter with humour, warmth, and a sense of healing. Once again, SMG4 knocked it out of the park, BIG TIME. It had been just 3 months since ITS GOTTA BE PERFECT, and the fact this is almost at the same quality is insane, and the fact it is 52 MINUTES LONG, is shocking. Makes me wish we had a 1-hour SMG4 movie. Anyways, the humour in this one, is even better than in ITS GOTTA BE PERFECT, lines like “its so good you can eat it raw” or SMG4 screaming at the end was hilarious or even when Meggy looses it and aims a gun at SMG4, threatens him, and then when she leaves with Tari, SMG4 just shocked to the bone, eats a potato and says “so good you can eat it raw!” always gets a laugh out of me. This movie also looks great, just like ITS GOTTA BE PERFECT, and the feel you get to this movie, is very similar to Meggy’s Destiny in my opinion. And once again I love every single character in this movie is PERFECT. I love bowser, I like Karen, I love Saiko, SMG4, SMG3, Mario, Bob Swag Chris, and One Shot Wren is a top tier villain with a pretty good back story for being a villain, and off course, the best characters where Tari and Meggy. While Meggy didn’t go on too much of an Arc, she was definitely the best part of it. All she wanted to do was to reunite with her idol, but instead, she meets him, find out he is horrible, and he give her level 1000 trauma boss. but in the end, Tari helps her though it. And Tari as well, has a great Arc. She goes from being super scared, but after seeing what Wren does to Meggy, she starts to become more mentally strong, and is able to make an oasis for her and Meggy, and she calms down Meggy when she is about to shoot SMG4, and she is the one that orchestrates the plan to beat Wren and get out of the simulation. Mario was also great, as he, for the most part tried helping Meggy when they where stuck in the hospital aera. The ending where Meggys says she wished that she could have gotten along with wren and she said it was great to have a rival like here was really sad, and the end part where SMG4 said how they where growing, and just everything in that last scene was so sweet. This feels like a completely different group to the season 12 one. This one feels like everyone has each other’s backs. That not something I could have even dreamt of saying at times in season 12. Overall this is amazing, and there are not really any issues I have with it, I just think that the emotional parts in revelations and ITS GOTTA BE PERFECT are just oh so slightly better than the ones in this, and that is why they are slightly better.  Sometimes I see stuff like “this is the darkest SMG4 vid of all time” so I am just going to say that, NO, I don’t see Western Spaghetti as the most dark. It’s a top3-top 5 one, but it has a happy ending, the darkest I would say, is season 3’s Sad Story of a bob bomb, as in Western Spaghetti, we get a happy ending, but in Sad Story of a Bob Bomb, we don’t get one, the bob bomb and king bob bomb don’t respawn, there just dead…its quite  sad and Dark, but yeah, I just had to say that.

After this movie, SMG4 was on a role, episodes like SMG3’S Browser history and Mario VS Skibidi Toilet , The Watermelon Man and We Don't Talk About What Happened in the Elevator came here, and the show really felt like the standard of season 5,6,7 and 8, but then we where blessed with one more arc..

***Mini Arc Number four: WOTFI 2023 Arc (2023) (3 episodes)***

This one, was slightly worse than Western Spaghetti, but still another masterful Arc. this one, is based of SMG3’S notebook, and how he normally write in it, and that it has secrets. And also has a outlying part of SMG4 and SMG3 being better friends, because as SMG1 said it “how can you guys protect anyone if you can’t even get along?”. However, Mario gets instructions from someone that SMG3’S notebook has a Pizza recipe, so Mario steals it from SMG3, and gives it to someone…leading up to WOTFI 2023…

***War Of The Fat Italians 2023 (a Masterpiece).***

This WOTFI right here, is one of the best off all time, and the second best of the 2020s so far (done before WOTFI 2025). The plot goes that SMG4 and SMG3 must infiltrate Casino Paisano (owned by Marty, a cheap carboard cut out made by Mario) and go to the top level to get SMG3’s notebook. The hype for this one was pretty big as it was basically a choose youre own fate, as the week before this WOTFI, there was at a very long live stream on the options to choose. I do think other options would have been better and funnier, but overall there where pretty good, and the humor was on point. While WOTFI 2021 is the better WOTFI, WOTFI 2023 is funnier by a huge margin, its great. After SMG4 and SMG3 beat up Mario, SMG3 finally gets his notebook back, and then they must escape, during a rap…its not all bad, the part where bob questions why are they doing it, is pretty funny, bout outside of that, this rap sucks, like, why do we have meggy’s VA sining? Meggy wasn’t even in this Arc, outside of a 5 second Cameo. (though the instrumental to it is absolute FIRE. It was composed by Jared Carey, and this guy obvoisuly knows what he is doing since the instrumental for the 2022 rap and 2023 are the best rap unstrumental. In fact, 2023 is the best one in my opinion it’s a 10/10, just sucks the rapping is bad) Any ways, in the end, SMG4 uses a forklift that he got, to wreck Martys and Marios car they where driving in, and getting them in Jail. In there, Mario asks Marty why he wanted the notebook, and he reveals that someone printed a not saying that SMG3 has a pizza recipe, which is why Marty wanted it. In the end, SMG3 announces that he is moving to the showgrounds and making a café called 3’s coffee and bombs. It ends with SMG4 and SMG3 being tyred, and going to sit down and have a coffee. SMG3 adds something into the notebook, and SMG4 asks what he is adding in, and 3 says he will never tell, but the camera shows us that he is drawing a picture of he and SMG4, ending with the screen panning to the sunset, before the camera zooms out…of a TV, and someone says away from the camera that was great, and he wanted to go it again sometime. This guy will soon to be revealed as Mr Pussles, the season 14 antagonist, but from this dialogue, is is basically revealed, he is the Mastermind of ITS GOTTA BE PERFECT, Western Spaghetti and the WOTFI 2023 Arc. outside of that, this WOTFI looks great, is very funny, Mario does well as being a villain, its quite fun, kinda feels like an classic WOTFI, but also doesn’t, the Mr Puzzles reveal at the end was also great, but by far, the best part of WOTFI 2023 is SMG4 and SMG3. They bounce of each other great, and are a great Duo, and the end part where SMG3 draws a picture of him and SMG4, shows how much he truly has changed since 2020, and bookends his hero Arc. simply lovely. This would also probably be the best or second best WOTFI, if it wasn’t for that horrible rap, but outside of that, I think this is a great WOTFI, and so much better and 2022’s. now the reason why I said there where 3 movies in season 13, is because WOTFI 2023 is done in such a way, it feels more like a movie than a WOTFI, but I am all in for it, this is amazing

***COTS (Character Of The Season)***

And for Character Of The Season, its…SMG4…nah im joking its not SMG4, he was great, and the 3^(rd) best guy, but the guy that did win COTS was…SMG3. Yes, he finally did it. Being one of, if not the best character from 2020-2022, SMG3 finaly broke thourhg this year, t easily beat SMG4 and Mario to the COTS, for the first time in 11 years, that is the longest time ever to get a second COTS title, but SMG3 was just simply to good. It didn’t matter if it was a normal episode, or the ITS GOTTA BE PERFECT or WOTFI 2023 arc, SMG3 was always great, and more than deservingly of the COTS title. I loved SMG3 this season.

***Conclusion***

In conclusion, Season 13 is an absolute MASTERPIECE. This season was very different, it broke away from the normal formula a bit and everything was done a bit differently, and EVERYTHING paid off in the end, producing SMG4S strongest season since season 8, and being one of the best the show has to offer, and it shows, as every video has above 2 million views. This season was also the last where SM64 sprites was used at least a tiny bit in each episode. This season also had a lot of promise for season 14 as it was going to reveal everything that happened this season. Will Season 14 be able to live up to how Amazing season 13 was? Well we will just have to wait and see, but this is SMG4 season 13: a 10/10 Masterpiece.

The barista working double shifts at a Starbucks makes $17 an hour.^(1) She lives paycheck to paycheck. The coffee company’s new CEO made $96 million in his first four months.^(2) A bit of a difference between these numbers. One of these numbers is the strike. The other is the reason it will not end quietly.

This isn’t a labor negotiation playing out in conference rooms. This is a reckoning about what work is worth in America, and Starbucks is the stage where its currently being played out at. For restaurants and hospitality operators watching from the sidelines, what happens here shapes every conversation you’ll have with your own teams about wages, hours, and loyalty over the next three years.

**The Union Asked For One Thing. The Company Said No.**

Starbucks Workers United (SBWU) represents 9,500 baristas across 550 unionized locations.^(3) They have been negotiating since April 2024. ^(3) That’s 18 months. In that time, they secured 33 tentative agreements on non-economic issues ranging from grievance procedures, dress code, harassment protocols. Progress on the margins. Fine.

Then the company shut down negotiations on wages. Starting pay for baristas sits at $15.25 an hour in most states. The union’s core demand is simple: guarantee minimum hours per week and increase take-home pay. They are not asking for the world. They are asking for enough hours to qualify for the benefits Starbucks advertises on recruitment posters.

Baristas often do not get those hours. A 20-hour work week is common. That means no health insurance. That means no dental. That means working two jobs. Diego Franco, a Chicago barista, said it plainly: “I make $17 an hour, and I live paycheck to paycheck. I can’t sustain myself on that. I can’t sustain my mom’s medical bills.”^(1)

In September 2024, Starbucks Workers United gave the company their economic demands.^(1) The company’s bargaining team told the union to be patient while the new CEO adjusted to collective bargaining. In December, the company came back with a response: no counterproposals. Just no.

The union filed charges of bad faith bargaining. Some 5,000 baristas walked off the job.^(4) Starbucks fired back with a meager 2% annual raises. No immediate pay bump. No schedule guarantees. No changes to benefits. The union’s 490 elected bargaining delegates voted on it in April. 82% rejected it.

**The Company Says It Pays $30 An Hour. The Math Does Not Add Up.**

Brian Niccol took over as Starbucks CEO on September 9, 2024.^(1) He arrived from Chipotle with a $97.8 million compensation package, more than twice his Chipotle salary.^(5) In four months, he made $96 million.^(5) His base salary is $61,538. The stock awards totaled $90 million. His signing bonus was $5 million. The rest covers a private jet, a satellite office in Newport Beach California, and commute costs of $72,000 annually.^(2)

Starbucks says the typical barista compensation package totals $30 an hour when benefits are included.^(1) This number is technically true and strategically dishonest. Benefits only apply to employees working 20 hours per week. Many baristas do not get those hours. The starting wage remains $15.25 an hour, and a barista must work multiple shifts to earn enough money to live. When you divide actual annual earnings by actual hours worked, the math collapses.

The company also says it receives over 1 million job applications annually and boasts lower turnover than industry averages.^(1) Jobs are framed as plentiful, workers should feel grateful in one narrative. The company is spending heavily to recruit because most workers are leaving is the other narrative. High-volume applications to low wage jobs is not evidence of fair compensation. It is evidence of desperation. The economy has been a bit wonky lately.

Starbucks operates on thin margins. Coffee prices increased 70% in recent years.^(6) Commodity costs and tariffs squeeze input expenses relentlessly. The company’s operating margin contracted 500 basis points in the fiscal fourth quarter to 9.4%.^(7) Niccol inherited a turnaround situation. He didn’t inherit wealth. He made a choice about who would bear the cost of recovery.

That choice appears in his budget priorities. The company closed 627 stores in Q4 2025 and laid off 900 corporate employees.^(7) Starbucks also added assistant store managers and invested in labor improvements under the “Back to Starbucks” restructuring. These investments signal that Starbucks can afford labor spending. The question is whether that spending reaches the people making the drinks or the executives making the decisions.

**When Did Brian Niccol Become the Story.**

This is the turning point. The strike is not really about 2% raises. It is about betrayal of a negotiation framework that was working.

Before Niccol arrived, the company and union had reached a breakthrough in February 2024.^(1) Starbucks committed to securing a first master contract by year end. Bargaining began in April. Both sides engaged actively. The union filed zero unfair labor practice charges during this period. Something real was possible.

Then Niccol implemented his “Back to Starbucks” turnaround plan. The company tightened dress codes, mandated office attendance for corporate workers, scripted customer interactions, and imposed operational rigidity.^(1) Many hospitality companies did the same thing. Lisette Harris, a barista of six years, described this as, “They’re trying to make you move as fast as you possibly can, make as many drinks as you can, and then adding additional practices on top of that.”^(1) The directive to write personalized messages on every cup became a compliance metric. Baristas have been written up for drawing smiley faces during rush periods.

This isn’t a customer experience improvement. This is a command and control approach borrowed from Niccol’s playbook at Chipotle. It works at Chipotle because Chipotle operates on a different business model. Starbucks was built on the premise that barista customer connection is the product. Niccol is framed as destroying service in the name of margin protection.

The union responded as it should. Between April and December 2024, the company stalled negotiations and rejected every economic proposal.^(1) The union has since filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges. According to SBWU, Starbucks has now committed more labor violations than any US company in recent history.

One detail matters: the Trump administration replaced the labor friendly NLRB general counsel in 2025.^(8) The new general counsel, William Cowen, directed subordinates to reopen every Starbucks case and reconsider judgments made in workers’ favor. The legal leverage the union had built evaporated. The union’s narrative is that the company realized it could violate labor law with minimal consequence. From the management’s perspective, this shifted the entire bargaining calculus. From a worker’s perspective, this was capitulation.

**Why the Strike Escalates Through Christmas.**

The “Red Cup Rebellion” began on November 14, 2025, coinciding with Starbucks’ most lucrative promotional day.^(4) The union authorized the strike with 92% support.^(9) Some 95 stores across 65 cities went out of strike.^(10) Starbucks claims the strike impacts less than 1% of stores. That is technically accurate and strategically misleading. 1% of 10,000 stores is 100 locations. The strike affects just 6% of unionized stores. The message matters more than the math.

The strike will escalate through the holiday season. SBWU is using a wave strategy, adding stores progressively to maintain pressure. Starbucks already employs non union workers and managers as replacement staff at struck locations. The company likely wants permanent replacements, protected or not. This is the highest-stakes moment the union has faced.

For hospitality operators watching this unfold, recognize the dynamics at play. This strike survives because the workers and their leadership believe they have nothing left to lose. The company believes it can outlast them. Both beliefs are true until one side flinches. The flinch almost always comes when financial pressure becomes intolerable.

Niccol can absorb short-term losses. He may or may not absorb holiday sales losses. The December selling season represents roughly 25% of annual revenue for QSR chains. A sustained strike through Christmas costs Starbucks tens of millions in lost sales, brand damage, and supply chain disruption. That is the union’s actual leverage point.

**What Each Side Actually Needs.**

The union needs to shift from pure economic demands to structural solutions. Pushing for higher hourly wages alone is mathematically appealing but strategically weak. The company has data showing that wage increases across 9,500 workers exceed their breakeven margin expansion. The union should negotiate:

Guaranteed minimum hours per week, structured around store productivity targets. If the store hits sales goals, every employee gets 25 hours minimum. This shifts incentive alignment.

Staffing improvements tied to customer experience metrics. The company is already hiring assistant managers. Bundle barista hour guarantees with proven improvements in customer wait times under four minutes.

Performance-based benefits thresholds. Baristas who hit attendance and productivity targets receive expanded health insurance coverage at lower employee cost share.

Stock grants instead of just wages. Give baristas equity in company performance. When you own a piece of the company, wage negotiations become partnership conversations.

The company needs to acknowledge that Niccol’s playbook failed. Wall Street already knows it. The stock is down 15% year over year despite Niccol’s $96 million package.^(11) The “Back to Starbucks” restructuring hasn’t yet delivered. Operating margins contracted despite store closures and layoffs. The company must pivot.

Niccol should bring a new economic proposal that addresses core issues. Even if it falls short of union demands, forward motion signals good faith. Stop using operational restructuring as cover for union busting. Commit to ceasing aggressive store closures targeting unionized locations. Acknowledge that the transition disrupted negotiation trust and reset the framework.

Do the salary math in public. A barista working full-time at $15.25 an hour earns approximately $31,720 annually before taxes. Many work part-time and earn less than $20,000. Niccol earned $96 million in four months, or $24 million per month. The CEO monthly compensation exceeds annual barista earnings by 1,200 times. This ratio is indefensible in the court of public opinion. Cut his comp to $30 million annually. Use the savings to fund meaningful barista raises. The $66 million reduction costs less than the legal fees and brand damage of a protracted strike.

For the union, this may mean proposing a three-year package that includes small annual wage increases, guaranteed minimum hours tied to store performance, expanded health coverage, and a process to resolve unfair labor practice charges in exchange for good faith management practices going forward.

For the company, this means accepting the staffing demands as operational investment, not labor costs. Make a public pivot on “Back to Starbucks” messaging. Reframe as “Supporting Our Partners.” This signals a philosophical reset. Commit to a shared accountability framework where union and management jointly review staffing targets annually.

**What This Means for Your Restaurants.**

Hospitality is watching closely. If Starbucks crushes this strike, the message is that union demands are unreasonable, shareholder returns come first, workers are replaceable. If the union wins decisively, the message is to organize, stay unified, you can move management.

The middle path, where both sides find a deal that acknowledges genuine constraints while genuinely supporting employees, is the only sustainable model. You cannot staff restaurants with transient labor. You cannot build culture with workers who clock in and check out. You cannot compete on experience when your team is exhausted from understaffing.

Starbucks’ founder, Howard Schultz, seemed to have understood this. He built Starbucks on the premise that taking care of your people creates loyal customers. That was not sentimental. That was strategic. Niccol seems to have forgotten it.

The strike entered its second week as Starbucks headed into the holiday peak. Momentum favors the union. Niccol can ride this out for weeks. He cannot ride it out forever. The question is not whether the strike ends. The question is what resolution will costs more. Is it settling with the union or absorbing sustained brand and financial damage.

For restaurant operators, understand this moment. Your labor challenges are Starbucks labor challenges scaled down. Pay matters. Hours matter. Respect matters more. Build structure around those three things, and strikes become unnecessary. Ignore them, and the reckoning comes eventually.

The barista making $17 an hour is not asking to be rich. She is asking to pay her rent without working two jobs. That is where the conversation should start.

from someone,

knowing there's someone

steadfast behind you,

I’m hoping to meet some new people who share similar interests or just enjoy good conversation. I’m just a girl with a cozy-but-witchy vibe — think books, gardening, crystals, curiosities, taxidermy, and horror movies.

I love fostering animals, exploring local events, and connecting with people who appreciate a mix of earthy, spooky, and artsy energy.

We used to hang out in a group first, and then I told one of our mutual friends that I like her. Then I got to know she also likes me. We went for a walk the next day, then dinner, coffee dates, etc., for a week, and everything was good. But she told me before that she needs time for relationship, so I was like, Okay, we are still going on dates and let's see how it goes. Yesterday, our group of 6 went out for dinner, and we all were a little drunk in the cab. We held hands for the first time, and we kissed. It was a lovely night. After that, we went to one of our friends places for a sleepover, so we made out. But I said 'I love you' after some time while kissing her because it was really intimate, and I realized I said it in heat of the moment, and she got a little upset. Then I asked her what happened, but she wasn't talking, just saying ""nothing happened"". After some time, she told me that she is a little scared to be in a relationship, and we should go slow, as she was in a 2-year relationship and broke up 9 months ago. Even though I get it (emotional stuff can be tough to get over), I'm scared I'm just a rebound. I also have an anxious attachment style, so I'm really scared to lose her because I actually like her. We kissed after that, and I hugged her. I dropped her at her place in the morning, and we both are still happy, we are going on a beach date in the evening. It's just that conversation was really weird, and I feel like I might get fucked emotionally in the future. its been few days I posted this on some other Subreddit but situation is kinda same. we went for morning walk, I dropped at railway station when she was leaving to home and we hugged. I cant afford to lose her man I really like her, what should I do? Should I give her some time ultimatum about when she should talk about it but I feel if I do it, it will feel like if she says yes for a relationship she said it under pressure. I want her to bring that topic and make it official as soon as possible. Please help me out, guys!!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1p5c6s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1p5c6s5/next_level_insane_dopamine_detox/,Next Level - Insane Dopamine Detox,"Day 1.
I'm a 25 year old digital ghost. I'm compelled to write here for 2 reasons: 1. I'm a hobby writer with my head in the clouds but doing my Masters in CS, so I'm highly technical too. 2. I have a habit of cutting people out of my life, and don't have any friends (by my own choice) to seek validation (let's be honest). I will do this for the next 16 weeks as an accountability measure.

Being that I don't have any friends, my life experiences in the last 5 years have made me digitally a ghost. The ""suspicion"" of having abaolutely no social media, means that that people don't trust me as much, because the paradox is that if I refuse to reveal everything than I must have something to hide apparently.

Most of my validation seeking happens when I'm writing. Currently, my Detox reward for myself is to work on my memoir for 1 hour a day but ONLY if I do the following tasks: 

1. No Porn - Currently I don't have a girlfriend. My last relationship ended 2 months ago, then I had some ONS after that, and then I got some clarity, so I need to be away for a long time and conserve...

2. Do Nothing - I will spend 1 hour each day, sitting and doing absolutely nothing.

3. No Music - Music heightens whatever I'm feeling. I've had a lot of failed relationships and music stimulates the realization of the abysmal void in my heart. No music = no stimulant.

4. Wake up at 7. Sleep at 21.

5. No AI - I recognize that AI is NOT a sentient human. Although programmed to be intelligent, I need to recognize I don't need AI as a friend. I've deleted all AI accounts permanently and this accountability measure will be to ensure I don't jump back in.

6. No Caffeine - It destroys sleep, so no coffee or tea. Only hot water, cold water, juice etc.

7. 200 Push Ups. 200 Squats - I already do this but good to have it for daily checkin. 

One of the main reasons why I quit social media 5 years ago was/is because it feeds females anti-male content, and males anti-female content. It sells promiscuity as some sort of a grand achievement. But I've had the ""privilege"" of living a hedonistic lifestyle. After many failed relationships and lots of draining one-night stands, I can confirm that I found the peak, and it was empty. There's nothing there. I've been pretty detoxed already, but I want to see how far I can push myself to baseline humanity. And maybe...just maybe, while trying to find baseline normalcy, I might find someone else trying to do the same.

I don't know how to use reddit. Will use this as accountability. Don't trip. Sorry for typos and shit, but your attention span probably didn't catch them anyway. ",4,1763974697.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I know I'm on a bad foot with being a ""good roommate"" so I always come into interactions with my roommate with the knowledge that I am a bit of a burden and I need to try to make up for the additional work I give her so I'm not being a complete drain. But this means I have a really hard time telling if I'm being unreasonable about how annoyed I've been at her recently.

Annoyingly most of what my issues is \~vibes\~, yknow when someone is clearly Giving You Vibes but they've done nothing wrong so you're just stuck wallowing in their vibes arsenic, that's mostly it, but I'll try to give some examples that hopefully show the more overall picture. 

1. She went to her work with a disabled older woman after already showing symptoms of the flu I got the flu first and am how she got it. I was so sick I couldn't climb into my loft bed because of fatigue and dizziness making me at risk of falling so I was sleeping on the couch. She got chewed out by her client for putting her at risk because obviously the flu is very dangerous for someone her age, and then roommate came back and said it was because I was sleeping on the couch and got her sick that she got chewed out and suggested I replace my bed entirely with a non loft bed (the room I'm in is so small if i didn't have a loft bed I'd have no other furniture) so the next time I don't get her sick. 

2. Her standard of cleanliness is that there's no dirt, mine is that there's not clutter, I don't mind if something needs dusting if everything's organised and away, she will pick up the mess, wipe under, and put it back. She can just be so passive aggressive about the counters being clean. Have you ever had someone Clean At You? like it's another vibes thing but if you've had it happen to you you know exactly what I mean. In the mean time I will put away all her stuff and not complain because it's my standard of cleanliness and I recognise that she doesn't care about it the way I do. 

2.1. The other day I had a friend over to do crafts and she asks me to make sure I tidy because crafts can make a mess, in order to get the house tidy for my friend to come over I had to put her half finished crafts away for her because she left them out. 

2.2. A bit ago I came home with shopping and took off my shoes in the door because it was pissing down and I was trekking in mud. I go put away the groceries. She then goes ""Can you not leave your shoes in the doorway?"" she proceeds to leave her shoes in the doorway several times after that.

3. Her dog SUCKS. I knew I was moving in with a dog, I love animals so I had no complaints. This dog is the sweetest thing on earth, 25 kilos of pure unadulterated love and affection, you can stick your whole hand in her mouth and she won't bite, the most danger she is is the fact that she is knee height and loves running at peoples legs to get pats. However: she has no recall, I cannot get her to come with any consistency at all, she loves escaping out the door, I had to chase her down the street on halloween because I didn't put her away before the kids showed up. She barks at the tv if there's any animals, at the doors if she sees a car bird or human, or at us if we put her outside and she's unhappy with that. You cannot cut her claws, she needs to be sedated to get them down, and they are SHARP, and she jumps on you! with all her claws! she tries to eat food off counters or the coffee table, she doesn't sit or stay, she pulls on her leash, and when I first moved in she was almost 2 years old and not desexed yet (she has been desexed since.) My roommate works too much to take her on walks as often as she needs and I can't help because I can't do it safely, and so she's so hyperactive. she's not abused or neglected she's just really poorly trained and my roommate won't put her in doggy daycare or hire someone for her and won't put in the time herself to improve her so she just sucks. 

4. I really want a cat, my family rescues cats, I volunteer at a shelter, I have had cats my whole life, I am such a cat person. So does best friend. One day they come to me and say ""Best friend wants a cat, is that cool?"" and I go ""yeah totally not a problem."" because it's not a problem. They get a cat (from a shelter I hate because of it's unethical practices, without including me but while including another friend who doesn't live with us) while playing with the cat I say ""aw you'll be my cats little brother!"" and roommate says ""oh no, we're only getting one cat"" HUH???? NEWS TO ME???? the cat unfortunately got very sick and before we could get him to a vet he was too far gone and he had to be put down. A few months later I low key bring up me adopting that cat I wanted and roommate goes ""Well I only want one cat in this house, and best friend should get theirs first, and they're still heartbroken over the kitten dying so let's not."" Only roommate and I are on the lease and pay rent, best friend doesn't at all. Why the fuck would best friend have priority over getting a cat in a house they don't pay for at all. I have chosen to drop the matter and get a cat when I move out.

BONUS! she and my best friend have whisper fights at each other, sometimes my best friend includes me to prove a point. My best friend is always in the right. Roommate refuses to get therapy. 

BONUS! yesterday I had my sister over and we decided to stay in and drink instead of me dropping her home like we'd planned. I didn't tell roommate she was sleeping over because countless times roommate hasn't told me when our mutual friend has slept over, and a few times in the past she's also had her niece over no warning. She gets home and tells me ""some warning would've been nice..."" 

Again, I'm not a perfect roommate, I struggle with a lot of basic tasks and have a limited amount of cleaning I can do in the day, I can't contribute as much financially because I can't work full time, and one time I got bleach on a brand new towel while dyeing my hair. But these issues along with the general passive aggressiveness is really getting under my skin, I desperately need to hear I'm not actually insane in how much this has been getting to me.

After 2 years of engagement and 1.5 years of planning and ""*procrastinating*"" (*hehe*), we have finally graduated. Sharing our suppliers and reviews :)



**1. VENUE**: *Azienda Verde Alfonso*

* A hidden gem. We're glad na nakita namin tong venue na to during our venue hunting sa isang bridal fair since our number 1 non-negotiable is dapat pet-friendly ang venue.
* It's a plus rin na walang corkage fees sa ibang suppliers. May exception lang sa catering, and lights and sounds.
* Malaki ang parking space. Can fit up to 100 cars.
* As for the guests, can cater up to 200 guests.
* Maganda ang stage and connected sa holding area na katabi ng Bridal Suite.
* And lastly, napakabait kausap ni Ms. Luday. Very responsive.
* Super bagay sa mga rustic theme ang wedding.



**2. COORDINATOR**: *Kisses and Smiles Events*

* We went to a Bridal Fair to look for a Coordinator kasi di na namin kaya kay DIY because of work. After ilang booths, nakita namin sila and nakausap namin yung owner, sila Jaime and Paula, who are very approchable and alam mong gusto nila yung ginagawa nila.
* After booking them, they made a Viber GC kaagad ang a master google sheet para dun namin ilalagay lahat ng information for our event.
* They even joined us sa final detailing and food tasting with our caterer. They also joined us sa occular sa venue kasi sila rin ang stylist namin. And when our wedding is near, nagpunta pala ulit sila sa venue para sa final detailing ng stylist which we really appreciate.
* Also, they helped as with the Marriage documents processing, booking of other supplies, Bridal Car, Cake, and on the day of the wedding, the coordinator na naassign sakin ay super maasikaso. Di ko nafeel na napagod rin sila.
* Lahat rin ng tinurn over namin sa kanila sa morning ng wedding ay naturnover rin samin after.
* They made our day stress-free talaga. Super thankful kami!



**3. HMUA**: *Cairo Manta*

* I made a list of the HMUAs I gathered, and Cairo is one of the top 3. Gusto ko rin kasi included na yung Entourage as a gift na rin for thanking them sa pagpayag na maging part ng Entourage.
* What made us book Cairo is ang bilis magreply when inquiring. Gusto rin ni G2B ko that time yung make up style nya for me. So we booked him for a Trial makeup na rin kasi walang prenup included yung package na binook namin.
* During the Trial makeup day, 10 minutes earlier sila dumating sa place namin which is a plus, sabi nya kasi ayaw daw nyang nalalate. And inaral nya yung face, status ng skin ko, pati hair ko na super haba that time, he suggested na magpatrim ako, which I did naman hehe. He suggested rin na irampa ko yung makeup para matest if mahuhulas pa or hindi. Hindi nya pinapabura yung trial makeup. Nagustuhan ni G2B yung HMU ko.
* Before the wedding day, sila na ni coordinator ang nag-uusap for the makeup list timeline, nagkasundo sila agad.
* On the day of the wedding, Cairo and his team arrived sa venue 15 minutes early. Nagstart ang makeup on time, lahat natapos on time kasi mabilis rin gumawa yung mga kasama nyang nagmakeup sa mga abay. And of course, nagustuhan rin ng mga abay yung hair and makeup nila.
* As for me, magaan yung lapat ng makeup nya sa mukha ko for a bridal makeup. Not cakey at all. Hindi rin drying given na malaming ang weather.
* Also, lahat ng clients nya inuupload nya sa socials agad. Hindi sya namimili.
* I would book him again for our next event!



**4**. **PHOTOGRAPHER**: *ShootMe Photo*

* We wanted photos na documentary and candid style. We're glad na nakita namin sila Toast Wedding Fair. We booked them on the spot kasi nagustuhan namin yung portfolio nila.
* We also had a meeting a week before the wedding para idiscuss yung expectation on the day and if we have pegs rin, we gave our pinterest board link for their reference. And inaral nila yun ha.
* During the day of the wedding, I never felt awkward sa poses kahit na di ako sanay. Also, lahat ng details napipicturan. Details ng dress, flowers, lahat.
* They also gave us the raw pictures after the reception, included yung freebie namin na after party photos. Waiting pa kami sa edited pero ang ganda na ng quality kahit raw pa lang.



**5.** **VIDEOGRAPHER**: *Films by JayAr*

* Ahhhhh this team... Very creative. During our one and only meeting, ang sinabi lang samin is gusto nya matutulog at relax lang kami sa wedding day namin. Sila na ang bahala. And totoo nga, given na on the day lang nila nakita yung wedding details namin, nagamit yun sa SDE and super ganda ng kinalabasan.
* In general, yung comment sa SDE namin is ""very kami"" yung video. Authentic kumbaga.
* During the shoot, hindi pilit, it all came out naturally.
* They also gave us the copy of raw videos at the end of the reception.



**6. CATERER:** *Hizon's*

* Okay, for this one we're aware about the reviews and aminado ako na that made me anxious. Pero we stick to them kasi nasarapan kami during the food tasting lalo na sa baked salmon.
* Ang ganda rin ng collab ng styling ng coor namin at ng Hizon's.
* As for the staff, very maalaga yung Captain Waiter na naassign samin, as requested ng coordinator namin. Yung mga waiters rin sa guests.
* For the food, nasarapan yung mga guests. They are giving us feedback kahit na di namin sila tinatanong which we really appreciate.



**7. EVENT HOST**: *Hosted by Ralph*

* If you want a host na gustong inaral yung love story nyo, si Ralph na yun! During our initial meeting, ang gaan agad ng aura. Ininterview nya kami para mas makilala nya. Ginamit nya yung story namin sa spiel nya sa reception which we appreciate kasi ibig sabihin, kinikilala nya talaga yung clients nya.
* Pati yung flow ng program namin is custom sa gusto namin, hindi kami traditional, ang ikli lang ng program namin kasi mas gusto namin ng party agad kasi weekday yung wedding namin. Tinutungan nya kami paano maachieve yun.
* And if gusto nyo ng live singer during dinner, si Ralph na rin yun! He can also sing... very well! Naentertain nya yung mga guests. They gave us feedback rin.
* Also, may partner rin syang DJ. Kaya wala kaming band.
* Umpisa pa lang super taas na ng energy nya kaya pati kami ganun. Very engaging and personal yung program namin. As per one of our guests: *""very kayo yung wedding program nyo""*.

It’s live now and launching on TinyLaunch Today!,"A few months ago my parents took the kids for a full weekend. Instead of resting, my husband and I grabbed our laptops and worked in a quiet coffee shop, trying to build something meaningful together.

After my daughter was born, I struggled with parenting stress and post partum depression. When she was four months old, I joined a traditional yoga teacher training at the Sivananda Center in Hungary. I almost skipped it because she was so little, but my husband kept encouraging me to go. Practicing yoga and meditation regularly helped calm my nervous system and gave me a way to recharge.

What I wanted was simple: a clean meditation timer and a beautiful journal. No clutter. No gamification. Nothing overly talkative. But I couldn’t find an app that matched how I actually practice.

So we started building StillMind. Often late at night, often tired, but motivated.

StillMind now includes

* a calm, minimal timer
* a beautiful post-session journal
* AI-guided meditations that adapt to your mood
* voice to note journaling during sessions
* private friends space to follow each other’s journey

Our goal is for people to feel relaxed the moment they open it, like they finally found the right place to meditate.

StillMind is already live on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

We’re launching on TinyLaunch on Monday and would love feedback or thoughts.

For a few weeks now, I got into the thought of upgrading my Lelit Anita 042PL TEMD. The Anita was my first espresso machine and I was mainly very happy with it. Two things were a bit annoying: The built in grinder (which is similar to the Fred, not too bad) and the 57mm portafilter (barely any accessories available).

Now I have looked into other models from Lelit and other manufacturers and am torn between staying within the Lelit world, or making the switch. I mainly drink classic dark roasted chocolaty 1-2 double espresso's a day and sometimes - mainly in summer switch to a capuccino a week. Still am not convinced that coffee with milk is coffee :-)

My research brought me to the Lelit Elizabeth, the ECM Classika PID and, the probably bigger upgrade because its a dual boiler machine: The Lelit Mara X V2.

What would you say would be a good and worthy upgrade? Note: I will definitely make the switch to a stand-alone Grinder in the next few days, the Mahlkönig X64 SD is almost ordered.",0,1763973526.0,espresso,6,0.5,False

When they look you in the eye and say, ""I have read and prayed, and I *know* it is true,"" they are describing a real experience.

If you try to throw facts at this experience, it works as well as trying to herd cats. You cannot argue with a feeling.

But while you can’t argue the *feeling*, you can - and should- argue the **interpretation** of that feeling!

The conflict comes down to a battle of **Epistemology** (how we know what is true). The Church relies on a framework that hijacks your real, human experiences and forces them into a narrow narrative.

To reclaim your own spiritual experiences without buying into the dogma, you need to swap that Anchor for a stronger model of truth.

Here is the letter I wrote to a friend deconstructing exactly how this works.

# Epistemology and the Battle to Define Truth

There are a couple of core arguments that face non-members and members alike. Maybe the most important is: **what constitutes truth?**

In my experience, the problem that is faced is there are two frameworks at play here.

1. **The Divine Anchor Framework** → A single witness or testimony from a single source.
2. **The Cable Framework** → Multiple sources should **converge** (or ""corroborate"") to form truth.

So let me outline what each framework is, my problems with the one, and why I take the stance of needing multiple sources.

# The ""Single Divine Anchor"" Framework

The basis for Mormon belief is often based in the personal, spiritual witness. Single or multiple experiences which are powerful in nature that confirm the truthfulness of a claim.

But there are two categorical problems with this method:

Firstly it creates a couple of dilemma’s:

1. **The ""Competing Claims"" Dilemma:** This is the most significant issue. A devout Muslim may feel a profound spiritual witness that the Quran is the final word of God. A Catholic may feel an overwhelming spiritual confirmation during the Eucharist. These different spiritual experiences confirm mutually exclusive truth claims. (For example, Mormonism and Islam cannot both be ""the one true restored church""). If the *same method* (a subjective, spiritual feeling) produces dozens of contradictory ""truths,"" then the method itself is not a reliable tool for distinguishing what is *objectively* true from what is false.
2. **It's Unfalsifiable:** A claim that relies on a subjective witness is a ""closed loop."" If a person has the ""witness,"" any evidence that contradicts it (like DNA evidence, history, or archaeology) is dismissed as ""a test of faith"" or ""man's flawed wisdom."" If the person *doesn't* get the witness, they are told it's a personal failing (they didn't pray hard enough, they have unconfessed sin, etc.). There is no scenario where the claim itself is allowed to be proven false. A claim that cannot be falsified is not a strong claim.
3. **Human Psychology and Bias:** Our feelings are incredibly powerful, but they are not always reliable indicators of fact. We are highly susceptible to **confirmation bias** (wanting something to be true and thus finding ""evidence"" for it) and **emotional reasoning** (believing ""I feel it, therefore it must be true""). A powerful, emotional experience in a community of believers is a very real psychological event, but it's not a reliable test for historical or scientific facts. → to expand upon this further I believe that for example a spiritual witness cannot prove that the BoM is a historical document, it can only prove that you feel good things about the things that you are reading.

The second and maybe the ugliest and liberating part of my argument is where I clip the divine from the divine anchor argument. (Or IMO restore divinity to your logic and other forms of investigation)

# Why the Experience is Real, but the Narrative is False

As a Mormon, I was taught about Moroni 10:3-5, followed the formula, and had spiritual experiences. But then I had similar and more powerful experiences in various situations. I had experiences when I was in Thailand practicing Yoga in the mountains. I had experiences where I was meditating and reading books from Alan Watts. I remember crying my eyes out when I finished *12 Rules for Life*, a book from psychologist Jordan Peterson.   
  
(Never mind experiences I have had with psychedelics, which are in a total other realm, that don’t even compare to anything the Mormon church could offer).

Anyhow, what am I supposed to do with these spiritual experiences, and what do they prove?

Am I supposed to go around preaching that Alan Watts is a prophet from God, that everyone is supposed to go on a yoga retreat to Asia, or that everyone needs to go on a psychedelic trip? As I reflected on that, I have come to the conclusion that subjective spiritual experiences are for my benefit and not to be used as tools to mould the world to my desires.

And this is where the ugly part of the argument comes: I do believe that any intense form of spiritual concentration will produce spiritual experiences. What I do not agree with is that it proves the truthfulness of the divine claims of the Mormon church. Your feelings didn't produce that narrative; you and everyone else were fed that narrative and it was associated with the experience.

The narrative was produced by men- men you could argue were divinely inspired but still fallible - that deserve the same scrutiny as anyone else (arguably more, because of the fantastical claims being made!!!).

Secondly, when we place feelings and experiences as the source of supreme truth, we are forced to devalue other sources of truth. We have to: logic, scientific investigation, and all other means of investigation.

# The ""Multiple Threads"" (or ""Cable"") Framework

A more robust and reliable basis for truth isn't a single thread, it's a steel cable woven from many independent strands.

In epistemology, the concept is sometimes called **consilience**, or the convergence of evidence. The idea is simple: a claim is most likely to be true when **multiple, independent lines of evidence** all point to the same conclusion.

These threads of the cable are (but not limited to):

* **Physical Evidence:** (Archaeology, genetics, geology, etc.) What does the physical world tell us? Does the evidence we can dig up and test support the claim?
* **Historical Evidence:** (Textual criticism, linguistics, documented history, etc.) Do the claims align with what we know from historical records? Do the texts show signs of being from the time and place they claim to be?
* **Logical Consistency:** (Philosophy) Is the claim rational? Does it contain internal contradictions? Does it make logical sense?
* **Explanatory Power:** Does the claim explain the world we see? Does it provide a better, more comprehensive explanation for the facts than other competing claims?
* **Personal Experience:** This is still a strand! A personal, subjective experience is a piece of data. However, in this robust model, it is *only one strand* among many.

The concept is that truth converges constantly along each line. If any piece of the evidence leans towards contradicting the other sources, then that thread is placed under scrutiny.

This is why it's so important to examine *all* strands, including spiritual experiences, to understand their proper role.

# Why I Choose the Cable Method over the Divine Anchor Framework

The Divine Anchor method provides certainty. The answers are not messy they are clear black and white answers. Don’t drink coffee because God told me to. Is a much cleaner and easier on the brain answer than. I have to look through 300 scientific articles that contradict themselves and are hard to read about the effects of Caffeine on Humans.

But certainty is not stability.

Here is why the cable method is a healthier way to engage with the world.

1. Its anti-fragile: The divine anchor uses only one source to support your world view. The consequence is that its very brittle. If it breaks then your understanding of the world breaks, its why you need to defend it with everything you got. In contrast the cable method is flexible, one strand breaks the others hold true. You can asses truth from a much more stable perspective.
2. It creates immunity to gaslighting: The Divine Anchor relies on *internal* feelings which must be interpreted by *external* authorities. The Cable relies on **Public, Verifiable Evidence.** It grounds you in objective reality. If a leader tells you ""the church never hid polygamy,"" you don't have to pray about it; you can look at the historical record
3. It resolves the competing claims conflict: The Divine Anchor creates a world of ""My God vs. Your God."" There is no way to resolve a disagreement between a Mormon, a Muslim, and a Catholic who all claim a supreme spiritual witness. The Cable creates a shared ground for truth. It asks, ""What can we *both* see? What does the DNA say? What does the history say?"" It moves the conversation from a battle of egos (""I know!"") to a collaborative search for truth (""Let's look at the evidence"").
4. It restores true agency: The Divine Anchor pretends to offer a choice, but it’s a rigged game. If the only ""valid"" answer to your prayer is ""Yes,"" then you aren't making a choice; you are fulfilling an expectation. The Cable allows for **Informed Consent**. By looking at *all* the strands—the good and the bad, the history and the feelings—you are finally making a decision with your eyes wide open. You are no longer a child obeying a parent; you are an adult weighing the evidence.

# Addressing the ""Weighting Problem""

One of the biggest challenges I needed to navigate was, ""Why should I give equal weight to each thread of the chain?""

Why shouldn’t a spiritual witness outweigh all other evidence?

I think the answer is that **evidence should be given weight based on the question being asked.** (You don’t get out a ruler to measure how long you slept for. 😛)

You get out the appropriate measuring tool for the question.

**Example 1: A Historical Question** When a claim is historical (like is the BoM a historical document), it *must* be answerable by historical and physical evidence. In this case:

* DNA Evidence
* Archaeological Evidence
* Linguistic Evidence

The problem isn't about ""equal weight."" The problem is that a method designed to test **subjective, personal meaning** (prayer, feelings) is being used to answer an **objective, historical question**.

**Example 2: A Personal Question** If, however, your question is, ""Do Mormon principles help me live a good life?"" then historical evidence becomes *less relevant*, and **personal, subjective experience** (the spiritual witness) becomes the *most* appropriate measuring tool.

# Applying the ""Cable"" Framework to the ""Big Question""

This brings us to the real debate: How much weight should we give each strand when asking, ""Is the Church true?""

Let's first break down that question (and let's be thorough here). When we talk about ""is the church true,"" the way I define that question is: **""Is Joseph Smith divinely inspired? And does that line of succession continue today?""**

Based on this, here is how the two frameworks would approach an answer.

**The ""Anchor"" Framework** approach is:

1. Pray about this question.
2. If you receive a positive spiritual witness, the case is closed. All other contradictory evidence (historical, logical, etc.) must be flawed, a test of faith, or misunderstood.

**The ""Cable"" Framework** approach is more complex. It *requires* us to be honest investigators and look at *all* the strands to see if they converge. The questions look something like this:

* **Historical Strand:** Do the claims in the Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith's ""First Vision"" account(s) align with known history, archaeology, and linguistics? Do the texts hold up to textual criticism?
* **Physical Evidence Strand:** Do the DNA and archaeological records support or contradict the claims of the Book of Mormon?
* **Logical Consistency Strand:** Do the core doctrines (e.g., the nature of God, the plan of salvation, priesthood) remain internally consistent? How do we resolve documented changes and contradictions in what is claimed to be a perfect, restored doctrine?
* **Moral Strand:** (This is your ""character"" point) Do the documented actions of the prophets (Joseph Smith and his successors) consistently reflect the divine, moral character they claim to represent?
* **Personal Experience Strand:** And yes, *what does my spiritual experience tell me?* Does it provide peace? Does it feel true? And crucially, does this feeling *confirm* the other strands, or does it ask me to *ignore* them?

This is the real challenge. The ""Divine Anchor"" framework presents an easy, all-or-nothing answer. But as we've seen, it's an unfalsifiable loop that can (and does) ""confirm"" hundreds of mutually exclusive religions.

The ""Cable Framework"" is harder. It's messier. It requires us to live with ambiguity and to trust our God-given reason as much as our God-given hearts. It asks us to look at *all* the evidence—the physical, the historical, the logical, *and* the spiritual—and see where, or if, they converge.

My position is not that one framework proves the church false and the other proves it true. My position is that the ""Cable Framework"" is the only honest and reliable method we have for *beginning* the search for an answer, whatever it may be.",8,1763973489.0,exmormon,2,1.0,False

1p5buct,https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/1p5buct/the_last_couchsurfer_i_ever_hosted/,The Last Couchsurfer I ever hosted,"Sooo I was actually trying to comment to the thread that was asking about weird Couchsurfing experiences, but maybe my character count was too high? It wasn’t letting me comment. So just made another post. 

Actually stopped using Couchsurfing after this last guy I hosted about a year ago as well as got him banned off Couchsurfing. As background, I’ve hosted and stayed with many surfers over the years, love the aspect of cultural exchange, sharing stories and sharing meals. I have met friends I’ve traveled with overseas over the years and got into the job industry I’m in now because of Couchsurfing. I’ll also add that I always did due diligence vetting. Made sure they had a filled out profile, that the profile aligned with what I expected / the types of people I accepted, read  recent reviews, etc.

He was initially supposed to stay for two nights. Was considering moving to Colorado Springs, was checking it out , at the end of a travel stint. He got in very late at 1030 pm, I was ready to greet him and show him the guest room and get to bed asap. Before I can offer him a drink (which I normally do, I love the aspect of sharing ), he proceeds to ask me if I have a beer for him. Ok, it’s bit forward , but I chalk this up to cultural differences (as I can be used to things like this maybe culturally normal to one but rude to another) & his long travel day (he had flown in from overseas).  Did the friendly exchanges and he immediately jumps into some crazy stories. I’m half awake and half listening , the stories are so bizarre I don’t quite believe them… but gave him benefit of the doubt…. One involved him getting arrested overseas and spending the night in jail somewhere in the Middle East .. blah blah 

Asks me for another beer. Ok, now it’s a bit rude, but I oblige. I just want to get to bed at this point so I excuse myself. I offer him an edible before I leave as I was about to have one myself (Colorado hospitality haha). 

Next morning, I wake up and go about my day. I work from home so I’m having a slow morning , gearing up for some meetings and such. He wakes up probably an hour later and is in my kitchen. Starts chatting crazy stories again , picking up from the night before, seemingly oblivious I’m on my computer and trying to get some work done. This is the point I’m starting to get a little bit annoyed with him. When I Couchsurfing, the last thing I’m trying to do is get in my hosts way or overstay my welcome. He asks if I have breakfast for him to make, wtf? Getting a little too comfortable here too quickly buddy.  Of course I tell him there are eggs and such in the fridge he can make… I’m sorry this story has gotten long but I’m really trying to set the scene here 

I’m going to try and cut to the chase here. While making breakfast he asks for a drink. I offer coffee, etc. no, he wants alcohol. OH , ok lol. Some judgement but sure here’s half a bottle of 3 week old sweet wine my friend left here that I don’t like but couldn’t bring myself to throw away. Help yourself. Finishes the bottle. Over the next few hours over the morning he proceeds to help himself to all the remaining beers in my fridge (had at least 8-10 in there). I’m at the point where I realize there is something straight up wrong with this dude but he’s in my safe space and I’m just trying to keep him happy until I can get him the fuck out of my house. 

At some point I check my drawer with the edibles, to find they are gone. I ask him about it, he said he ate the rest of them hahaha omg the nerve of this guy!!! It was a brand new pack of wyld gummies. The dude ate 90 mg of thc the night before. After he cleared out my fridge of alcohol he asks if I have any more. THE NERVE. I told him he just finished my whole stash. He goes downstairs to his room to use the restroom and I bolt to the garage to hide the rest of my alcohol stash, just incase. Clearly he’s a straight up alcoholic and substance abuser. He claims he will replace the gummies he ate earlier. Sure, I believe it as much as I believe his stories

After all the amazing Couchsurfing experiences I’ve had, It was at this moment I realized I had a complete stranger in my house. For this community to work, the trust needs to be there. I’ve never felt taken advantage of or unsafe otherwise , sometimes just an awkward surfer…  but this dude was giving me the freaking creeps   The fact he thought nothing of the fact he just drank all my alcohol and ate all my edibles without a care in the world. I came up with an excuse and told him I wouldn’t be able to host him another night, I was leaving town a day early for my camping trip (this was a lie , I was not , I know I shouldn’t imply to him my house would be empty ) but I just wanted a safe , easy excuse to get him out. 

Later he went to run some errands in his Tesla he rented from the airport (he thought it was such a big cool deal he rented a Tesla omg ) , he later texted me that he was expecting an uber eats delivery to my house. I went to run an errand for myself and when I returned the uber eats grocery delivery was there. A 2 liter bottle of Tito’s, a gallon of milk and an ace bandage. I took that 2 liter bottle and hid it , that was now mine as collateral  (while I normally don’t expect an eye for an eye exchange wise, I had also never been wiped out of my alcohol and weed stash before, so I definitely felt taken advantage of). Unless he actually showed up with a replacement of gummies as promised , he wasn’t getting the vodka. I also thought keeping it away from him was for his own good haha. 

He had already packed up his bags and things at this point at had them in his car. He just needed to come back for his order as well as a new order he said he just placed for a food delivery. I had another errand to run but I wanted to wait for him to arrive so he could get his things and leave and never come back. I wanted to make sure he was going to leave my house and not idle around. 

His food delivery of a couple bowls of pho arrive (it would have been decent for him to order me one too right or at least offer to buy me lunch?). Nope. He supposedly didn’t have a physical credit card , some other bizarre story about him being robbed in another country , related to his jail story, but he had apple pay so  he was able to order things online. He grabbed his grocery bags but didn’t say anything about the missing vodka ( could chalk it up to the fact that no one was there to check an ID and maybe it didn’t get dropped off  lol). 

Also at some point earlier in the day I realized he had stolen my weed pen, in the same drawer as my edibles (this was never offered to him, he straight up took it). I casually asked over text if he had it , he admitted he had taken it with him on his errands and I wanted to wait for him to get back also to get that back! He gave it back to me (drained of course), took his food,  and I left. I checked my ring camera to ensure he was leaving, he took like 10 minutes in his car before he finally drove away. 

This whole experience was so wild to me, I was just happy to have this psycho out of my house and felt safe. It took a few days to really process it all and only then was I able to look back and realize how violated I felt after this whole experience. This stranger came into my home and helped himself to a bunch of my shit that wasn’t his. And didn’t compensate me for any of it.

Later via text when he supposedly was out of the city I felt comfortable to try and talk to him about how he made me feel and figure out wtf happened. I know this was pretty worthless to try and make sense of the mind of a crazy but i just had to get some things off my chest at least to make me feel better. He also promised via text he’d Apple Pay me 100 euros for everything (of course which I fully accepted I’d never see ). It was NOT the money for me. Obviously i wouldn’t enjoy the experience of Couchsurfing and hosting if I was broke, but it was the principle of sharing. I told him I had never been taken advantage of the way he did to me in my 10 plus years of Couchsurfing.

I did realize I put myself in a vulnerable position and I made the decision to not host another Couchsurfing again as long as I lived alone (I started hosting back in 2022 when I had 2 other roommates and lived in a ski town).  I have traveled and stayed with couchsurfers all over the world both with friends or partners and even as a solo woman and have had amazing experiences. I know I am an overly trusting person in general but i know the world is not a trusting place and i need to be smarter. It sucks that experiences like this can ruin it for Couchsurfing community and others in general but i know it’s just life and how the world works. Part of me knew that he could be psycho enough to come back , even though I felt I would never see him again. He left a his brand new kindle here which I also was claiming as mine (he said he was coming back to get it but I think gave up on that once he realized he pissed me the fuck off ). He defended himself via what’s app and never admitted to any wrongdoing. He said I was being overreacting because when he hosts couchsurfers back in Poland he loves to share (ok bro). I knew there was no getting through to him, but that’s ok, that wasn’t my intention anyways, mainly I needed to get things off my chest. The convo fizzled out, I reached out to Couchsurfing a few weeks later and got him kicked off the (they said they had to wait for his input on the situation to give him a chance to defend himself. I told them fuck that, that is unsafe for ME because he might know it was me. I waited a few weeks to report him in hopes he might not make the connection to me).  I shared with them our entire text convo as evidence and his profile was removed. 

I only wish my worst story was a boring ass socially awkward surfer;) thanks for following along on that journey.

TLDR : couchsurfer drank all my alcohol , ate all my edibles, smoked all my weed, had to kick him out, never apologized or admitted to any wrongdoing , got him kicked off Couchsurfing , and I’ve never hosted again since then.

1p5brxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/finch/comments/1p5brxa/alternative_ways_to_get_energy_in_the_morning/,Alternative ways to get energy in the morning,"I've seen a few people saddened by the update that no longer rewards energy for creating tasks, because they used to start their day by sending their birds on an adventure by setting up tasks. While I agree it's not a good update - rewarding the act of creating the task was one of those things that made Finch uniquely good - I did want to share the way I send my finch out in the mornings, it might help someone.

Activities! My very first task every day is to write down my dreams. There's an activity called dream Diary specifically for this that you can link to a task. Sometimes if the dream was long enough this alone is enough to full my energy bar.

I also use the breathing timer for energy breathing for ten minutes every morning and I swear it has a better effect than a cup of coffee.

Finally, I like to meditate in the mornings and I use the meditation timer for that.  If I have notes about the meditation I log them using goal reflection - that also contributes a lot to energy. This is another one that can sometimes full the energy bar all on its own.

I honestly hope they bring back energy for creating tasks but in the meantime, I hope these suggestions help. ",35,1763973053.0,finch,16,1.0,False

I stopped taking benzos cold turkey almost three months ago, but I have developed bad habits such as excessive consumption of caffeine and nicotine pouches to counteract the sedative effect of these poisons. 

I exercise a lot, walk a lot outside (20,000 steps a day), and eat a healthy diet, but I'd like to optimize this lifestyle by quitting nicotine pouches and excessive coffee consumption. 

I became addicted to cheap dopamine because my brain had become unable to perform beneficial cognitive activities due to these drugs. So I took refuge in coffee, social media, and wasting time.


If anyone has any advice, I'm all ears!

Sorry for the inconvenience, and have a great day!
