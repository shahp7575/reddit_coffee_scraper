1n12x0y,https://v.redd.it/nz0i65v8kglf1,Baron Samedi,"Baron Samedi, “The Master of the dead” in Voodoo, occupies a popular place as the guardian of cemetries, and the spirit responsible for an individual’s transportation to the underworld.The religion of voodoo is practised by individuals around the globe, with a reach that matches Western religions such as Christianity. Voodoo is a misunderstood religion that is often viewed as purely black magic. However, just like other religions, voodoo has a unique set of beliefs and its own deities. In voodoo, Gods are referred to as loas. One of the more prevalent loas in Haitian voodoo is Baron Samedi. He fills a vital role in Haitian voodoo as the master of the dead, ushering the newly deceased into the afterlife. Who is Baron Samedi? In Haitian voodoo, Baron Samedi is the head of the Guede family of loa. His name is often translated as Baron Saturday, Baron Samdi, Bawon Samedi, or Bawon Sanmdi. The last name of Satur day comes from the French translation of Samedi. Baron leads the Guede family, a group of loas with strong links to magic, ancestor worship, and death. The loas in the family consist primarily of lesser spirits, dress the same as Baron, have rude (even crude) attitudes, but lack the charm of their master. Baron is portrayed in Haitian voodoo wearing a top hat, black tuxedo, dark glasses, and cotton plugs in his nostrils. His image is often said to resemble that of a corpse that has been dressed and prepared for burial in traditional, Haitian manner. His face is said to resemble a skull, and he uses a nasal voice. Baron spends the majority of his time in the invisible realm of Haitian voodoo spirits. His behaviour is described as outrageous. He is known to spend his time drinking rum and smoking cigars, swearing profusely, and making filthy jokes to the other loas. The other spirits in the Guede family are said to behave in the same manner, without the suave ability of Baron Samedi. The Baron needs that suave nature because he is believed to chase mortal women, despite being married to the loa, Maman Brigitte. Baron’s time is spent lingering at the crossroads of life and death in the human world. When someone dies, Baron is said to dig their grave and meet their soul as it rises from the grave. He guides them into the underworld. Only Baron Samedi has the power to accept an individual into the world of the dead. It is also said that Baron ensures that all those who have died rot in the ground as they should, ensuring that no soul can come back as a brainless zombie. He will demand payment for this act, which varies depending upon his mood at the time. On many occasions, he is content to accept gifts of cigars, rum, black coffee, or grilled peanuts. He may ask other souls to continue wearing black, white, and/or purple. Baron Samedi, as the head of the Guede family, the group of loas that control life and death. This powerful family of spirits possesses numerous abilities. Baron is also a giver of life who is said to possess the power to cure any mortal of a disease or wound, provided he believes it is worthwhile to save that individual. Baron even has the power to overcome voodoo hexes and curses. An individual who is cursed by a hex or other black magic is not guaranteed death, if he refuses to dig their grave. As the Master of the dead and guardian of cemeteries, no one is dead until Baron digs their graves and ushers them into the underworld. In this manner, he can give life by preventing death. Baron Samedi, and the other spirits of the Guede family, serve as constant reminders of death’s role in this world. The spirits of the family all use foul language and behave in a raucous manner. Baron and the other spirits no longer heed the rules and regulations of the living, reminding everyone that death is a constant that will be dealt with by all. As everyone is bound to pass into death, the behaviour of the Guede family reminds the living to enjoy the benefits of the mortal world while they still occupy that realm. Ceremonies in Haitian voodoo that invoke the spirits of the Guede family often become erotic and crude, with participants drinking, dancing, and celebrating with r eckless abandon. The Guede family is the largest family of loa in voodoo, but is far from the most highly regarded spirits in voodoo. Like all loa in voodoo, the spirits of the Guede family occupy a place below the supreme spirit of voodoo. Those who practise Haitian voodoo believe in a distant and unknowable creator God, or loa. This loa is known as Bondy e or Bon Dieu. The literal translation of this name means “Good God”. Bon Dieu does not intercede in the affairs of the living, which is why voodooists direct their worship toward the spirits that are subservient to Bon Dieu. Each of these subservient spirits or loas, is responsible for a particular aspect of life. It is this realm that the Guede family and Baron Samedi occupy as the Masters of the dead. Every loa exhibits a personality that is representative of the aspect of life they should depict. As the Master of the dead, Baron Samedi’s reckless behaviour, carousing, drinking, and swearing are all symbolic of a family of spirits that have already lived and died. These spirits have nothing left to fear. Article by Kreolmagazine.com Art by AI then edited by Soror Φρόνησις ",1,1756255152.0,DarkDesiresOfOccult,0,1.0,False

1n12w19,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1n12w19/scream43/,Scream43,"We met on a forum much like this one.

It was one of those old-school boards for fans and collectors of horror movies. I'd commented a joke on one of Scream43's posts, I think it was about John Carpenter's *The Thing*, and caught his attention.

*Scream43:* @ Cherrybomb22 you're a clever one. i like you.

*Cherrybomb22:* woww i'm honored >\_<

Scream43 was a popular poster on the forum. Not a mod, but definitely well-liked and well-known by the community. I hate to admit it now, but I had a little bit of a screen crush. I had a habit of searching for his name on the ""active users"" tab. I'd actually get butterflies when I opened a thread and saw that little pixel-art profile pic of the scream mask. It was bad.

A few minutes later, he jumped into my private messages to keep the conversation going.

Scream was charming, I admit. Soon we were chatting back and forth for hours at a time, and not just about horror flicks. I learned that we shared almost every interest. He loved cooking and hiking, played the same games as I did, and even listened to some of the same bands. Despite our similarities, he always had a fresh, insightful perspective to offer. The man just radiated positivity. I always joked that he had ""golden retriever energy."" The thought of it makes me cringe out of my skin now.

It was a really low point in my life. I'd recently lost my job, was struggling with a recently diagnosed chronic illness, and found myself spending a lot of time holed up in my my apartment. Scream was a bright spot in my dull days.

Soon, we switched over to voice calls. He never turned on his camera. I didn't really feel comfortable showing my face either, so it worked out. I guess it gave me a feeling of security. An illusion of anonymity.

Despite this barrier, I really felt like I knew everything about Scream as the months wore on—everything but his real name.

I knew he lived alone, was around my age, and worked as a freelance writer, though he had dreams of one day directing a film. He wanted to adopt a pit bull, but couldn't afford the bills right now. His dad was estranged, but his mother and younger sister meant the world to him.

Hearing him pour his heart out to me on call, I felt it was only fair that I share little bits of my own life: what I studied in college, funny stories from my childhood, what I was making for dinner, things like that. I never went too far. I'm sure of that. I never gave any indication of what city I live in or where I had worked or gone to school. This was the first time I'd kept such a close online friend and I'd heard the horror stories, so I was still wary. I've seen the true crime documentaries, believe me.

Scream was a night owl. He usually didn't wake up and pop online until 2 or 3 PM. He spoke in an easy-going but measured way, his voice low. It was raspier in the mornings and late at night.

He'd always start the call the same way: ""What took you so long, Cherrybomb?"" It was a running bit between us; he was always the late one.

Occasionally we'd stream horror films together. Scream liked slashers (no surprise there.) Some of the stuff he recommended was a bit too brutal even for me. Indie B movies by no-name directors featuring a parade of severed heads, flayed corpses, immolation, and girls bound up in basements who were pushed to the brink of human suffering. He swore it was art. My taste leaned more surrealist and psychological, but I feigned interest so as not to put him into one of his moods.

Once, I'd mentioned offhandedly how I didn't particularly enjoy a film's exploitative treatment of women. I'd said it seemed gratuitous. Scream was downright offended that I couldn't see the artistry in the film. His intense reaction felt off-putting, almost out-of-character. He ended the call shortly after and didn't talk for the rest of the day. I couldn't stand it when he gave me the silent treatment.

In those few months, we got into a routine of watching a movie or playing games for a few hours, then chatting late into the night afterwards.

Sometimes we fell asleep on call.

One night, I dozed off without bothering to log out. Around 4 AM, a sound from my headphones woke me up. It was a series of low, shaky breaths punctuated by wet sniffs. There was no mistaking it: Scream was crying.

I heard him mumble something almost inaudible.

It sounded like ""I'm sorry,"" followed by my name. Not my screen name. How did he know my real name?

I stayed silent, not wanting to make him feel uncomfortable. As I waited, holding my breath, the sobs suddenly shifted into something else. Laughter. I'm sure of it. This man was sitting there quietly giggling into the mic. It went on for an uncomfortable length of time. I felt queasy. I just took off my headphones and I tried to fall asleep again.

I asked him about it the next day. Well, sort of.

*Cherrybomb22:* heyy, not to be weird but are u ok? u seemed sort of upset last nite lol

*Scream42:* nah i'm good. just stressed.

*Cherrybomb22:* awe no, why? :c

*Scream42:* i have to do something soon. it's gonna to be hard to pull off.

I didn't ask about how he knew my real name. Scream seemed so genuinely despondent that I didn't want to confront him. Maybe I'd misheard him last night, I thought, or else I'd mentioned my name at some point and forgotten. I just wished him luck with whatever was bothering him and we moved on.

We fell into our routine again and I tried to push that night from my mind. I almost convinced myself it was a strange dream.

A week later, I noticed the files. Scream was screen-sharing his computer so we could watch Terrifier together on stream. In the split second before he pulled up the window with the movie, I noticed an open folder on his desktop.

The folder was labeled with my name.

The files inside were MPEGs, each neatly labeled with a string of numbers. Looking back, I'm pretty sure those were timestamps. There were hundreds.

I felt sick. I sat through the movie, trying to convince myself that it was some misunderstanding. When the credits rolled, I left the voice call, double-checking that my camera and mic were disabled.

*Scream43:* is everything ok?

My palms were sweating as I typed.

*Cherrybomb22:* ya sorry. realized i have plans soon, bye

I unplugged my computer. That was the last time I spoke to Scream online.

In the following days, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.

I tried getting out of the house, going on errands and walking around the neighborhood, but it didn't help. My mental health was plummeting. I needed to talk to someone. I found myself missing Scream, as crazy as that sounds. He was the one I talked to when things weren't ok.

A week went by. Slowly but surely, I was doing a little better. I'd been going on morning runs, getting back in touch with old friends, even applying to a few jobs. My head felt clear.

I was lounging on my couch one evening with a bowl of microwaved popcorn and a bottle of pink moscato, sifting through streaming services for something to watch, when the phone rang.

Why did I have to pick up?

""What took so long, Cherrybomb?"" rasped that familiar voice. Scream was whispering, his voice strained, yet his tone was as friendly as ever. I couldn't speak. I could barely breathe. ""What's wrong? I miss you.""

Finally, I found my voice.

""We need some distance,"" I said shakily. ""For a while.""

There was a long silence, then a sigh.

""That's too bad,"" he said. ""I was hoping we could drag this out a little longer. See you soon."" He hung up. I was left trembling. I hate how much this perfect stranger could affect me with just his words.

I sat there, seething. 'See you soon?' What part of 'distance' did he not understand? I fell back on the couch, staring up at the light fixture, which I'd turned off earlier. As I did, I noticed something.

A tiny red dot of light pulsed from the center. A small camera had been wedged into the fixture, pointing down at the living room. At me.

I heard the back door creak open. My stomach lurched. I remember thinking how this couldn't possibly be happening to me. It was so cliche and yet so outlandish, the kind of thing you only ever see in movies.

My body was frozen, every muscle rigid, as I heard heavy footsteps creeping up behind the couch. He wasn't even trying to be quiet. I knew he wanted me to hear him.

""Smile,"" he said. ""You're on camera.""

I whipped around to see the man I'd been speaking to for almost half a year. The man I'd heard weeping on call. The man I'd vented to on late nights, begging for some kind of comfort or attention, for any affection he would give me.

He was unremarkable. Mid-sized, stocky, dressed in a plain black sweatshirt, black pants and dirty sneakers. He wore a skull-printed ski mask. In the dim light, I could see the whites of his wide, excited eyes. Then, I saw the machete.

It happened so fast.

He raised the machete in one gloved hand.

I swung the bottle down on his head.

It shattered on him, spilling wine everywhere and slicing into my hand. He screamed, falling forward over the couch and bashing his head open on the coffee table.

Then it was just me and the body.

\_\_

The judges ruled it as self defense. I found out his full name and where he lived, then. All the things he already knew about me. It was only fair. Apparently, he'd driven all the way from the west coast to find me, over twenty hours away. He was nothing if not dedicated.

Things went back to normal pretty quickly after that. I mostly keep quiet forums now, but I wanted to get this fever dream of an experience off my chest before I go back to lurking.

I'm trying out an idea I've had where I help people in Austin with their finances. Planning to do around 5 reviews for free and see how helpful they are. I thought it might make sense to share here since people looking for jobs or hiring can sometimes have money issues or may need help with planning.

The idea is: you send me your situation ahead of time, I’ll look over it and analyze it, and then we’ll meet up at a coffee shop/library/etc. to go through your options together 

Stuff I can help with:

* Budgeting and debt payoff
* Figuring out where your money’s going
* Getting started with investing / Reviewing your portfolio

I’m not a financial advisor, just an engineer who’s in a rut and has gotten really into personal finance and enjoys helping people think it through.

If you’ve been struggling with finances or just need more clarity, maybe this is your sign to finally take a step. Nothing changes if nothing changes.

Shoot me an email at [**ClydeFinanceCo@gmail.com**]() if you want to grab one of the free spots. Thanks!

Train to Galway 
Spend the afternoon exploring and spend the night in Galway

Day 2: Cliffs of Moher solo
Night in Galway 

Day 3: travel to Killarney

Night in Killarney

Day 4: ring of Kerry tour
Night in Killarney 

Day 5: more exploring in Killarney? TBD. 
Night in Killarney 

Day 6: travel to Dublin, explore the city and do the popular touristy things 
Night in Dublin 

Day 7: day trip to Kilkenny/Wicklow/Glendalough 
Night in Dublin

Day 8: Dublin in the AM and then head to the airport 

Where I’m torn: do I spend 3 nights in Galway or 3 nights in Killarney? I think I would like Killarney more BUT my first day in Galway will likely not be anything significant due to jet lag and the second day will be mostly Cliffs of Moher. Can I see everything I need to see with only 2 nights? 

Is a day trip to Kilkenny/Wicklow worthwhile from Dublin? Do I do a day trip to Belfast? Do I do just one night in Dublin and do 3 in Killarney/Galway?

Last year it was Lego - can’t go far wrong but still feels like a cop-out (before anyone comments, I’m not getting him the millennium falcon until I’ve found the money and the right coffee table display/cabinet to put it in - it will happen one day folks). 

Anyway, he loves books, comic books, Lego, he’s a massive movie buff too. So, I’m calling on the comic book guys and gals - any suggestions on birthday presents that you guys have loved? 

I’m reluctant to tell you who his favourite authors are and when his birthday is because he’s an active user of Reddit in a lot of communities and I’m convinced he’d suss me out 😂

Viktor looked up from his bed, forcing his eyes to stay open with great effort. The alarm would go off any second now anyway, the goddamned box screaming in the room, and going back to sleep would be pointless. Although he had a bed that was more comfortable than anything he'd lain on before in his life, he still found sleep to be escaping him these days. That had been the case since that argument with Martin almost a week ago, and ever since. His former self would laugh at the fact that an argument kept him so restless, but he couldn't help but feel regretful over what he'd said. Sure, he felt angry back then, still in a haze over what happened, what he'd discovered happened all those years ago. But Martin didn't deserve to be screamed at, not like that. If only talking were as easy as running.

He felt like such a damn coward. First off, he barely visited Dr. Eva, even though he had plenty of time in the morning. And he didn't even have enough courage to say sorry to Martin for blabbering like an idiot. At least his somewhat friendly relationship with Nataly wasn't completely in the water... well, he hoped that was the case, at least. He still didn't figure her out, and had no idea what went on in that robo-head of hers. But she wasn't calling him a scrub at least, so there was that. If not his abillity to keep relationships though, at least his abillity to do experiments with spike was finally getting somewhere. He'd had to use small doses several times this past week to run some tests. The scientists were always making funny faces when he managed to silence the spike at his command, so full of wonder and non-understanding were they. It was a fairly simple task to suppress it, especially since he'd only used small doses and went just a bit faster than they were. It couldn't compare to his steel-cart accident from the heist. That shit knocked him to his ass for a good while, but this was child's play.

Putting on his clothes hastily, he quickly went out of his room and towards the dining hall. Having access to free coffee was a pleasure he'd not experienced in life before, and he would not let go of that dose of happiness as long as his heart beat. It was only a few minutes walk, and that gave him some small time to think, which he didn't really want right now, but what could one do? He loathed to admit it, but he wanted to see Eva again, and wanted her to see him. His new teeth made him quite handsome by his standards, so maybe she wouldn't even be disgusted by the thought of going for a date. He'd avoided her like the plague, but he set his mind now. The running was over. He'd get that date in this neon-plagued city, or at least do anything to try. Steeling himself, he went to the coffee machine, got two coffees, and headed towards the med-lab.

Not even fifteen minutes later, he was standing in front of the door to the med-lab. His heart was beating rapidly, and his head was spinning like a carousel. He'd never gotten to ride one, but he'd imagined that this feeling he was going through must be similar to getting on one. He straightened his Decks' colored jacket, smelled his breath, and before he could change his mind or hesitate even more, he stepped in. Eva was leaning on her table, alone, and was looking at a tablet that shone text on her white cape. She was so beautiful that Viktor almost forgot his words right then and there, her caramel skin glistening in the dim light, her wide hips, her thick eyebrows. She looked out of this world, and completely out of his league. Almost he ran, but no, not when he'd come this far. He went to speak as she looked up from the tablet to meet his eyes. And then his new lens lit up, showing an incoming call from Martin.

*Not again!* Why did that guy always have to barge in at the most inconvenient time? He mentally clicked the command to turn down the call, looked back to Eva, and went to speak.

His voice came out high-pitched, barely recognizable as language. Quickly coughing off the stress, he looked back at Eva, just to see her smirking. Not 'I am laughing at you' kind of smirk, but a smirk nonetheless. Almost losing his spirit, he pressed on. ''Ummmm. Dr. Eva? I wanted to.. Wanted to ask if ya would ever like to have dinner with me. Not a dinner like date dinner, unless you want that, of course, but just a dinner kind of dinner. Somewhere in the middle city? Umm, to get to know each other better? Ya know?''

Great, that was the lamest date invite he'd ever heard. Not that he'd heard many in his life, though. And the repeating calls from Martin weren't helping him focus either. Dr. Eva looked to be caught somewhere in between, still smiling about his high-pitched start of speech and genuine surprise at his question. He could see the slight blush on her cheeks, though, which gave him a sliver of hope.

''Wow, I didn't expect that, Viktor. You really feel that way? I must say, I always thought you were just a shy man, and that's why you spoke the way you do.'' She pressed her finger to her full lips, as if contemplating the question. A beautiful smile was playing on her lips. ''And this is the first time I've been asked out so sincerely. I cannot promise you that I will come to like you, but I am willing to give this a try, Viktor.''

He could die of happiness right then and there. Never before was he so scared of failing to pick up a woman, and he'd not liked anyone else as much as he liked her. She was so kind, so witty and friendly, that everyone at least liked her. Sure, there were many pretty women in the Decks, but none as kind as she was. Nataly, for example, was a looker, but she looked like she would kill anyone that would ask her out. Sure, Viktor knew that to not be the case by now, but the others still feared her. Except Martin, but those two had their own will-they-won't-they going on, and Viktor never bothered. He'd kind of thought Eva would reject him outright, as there were better-looking and better-spoken men than him. But he got this chance, and he would die before he'd mess it up. He grinned so wide that his cheeks hurt, and idly swiped away another call from Martin.

Laughing, Eva stepped closer and held his cheek, squeezing it tightly. ''Is that how happy you are about having to pay for a lady's dinner? Adorable.'' She let go and went back behind her desk, looking at her computer screen and scrolling on her mouse. ''I'm afraid I don't have time now, though, but surely I can make some in a week's time. How does that sound?''

Viktor nodded repeatedly, at a loss for more words.''Yes, sounds great! Thanks!''

Another chuckle. ''Yes, thank you as well, Viktor. Now shoo, shoo.'' She waved her palm at him and gave him another smile. ''I need to work through some things''

Viktor spun on his heel and went out of the white room. *This is the best day ever.* Not only did he manage to go and ask Dr. Eva out, but she even agreed to go on a date! And Miss Nataly had the gall to doubt him and his chances with Dr. Eva. The corner of his vision was once again filled with an incoming call from Martin, at least the fifth by now. He accepted the call, not wanting to keep hanging up any longer.

Martin's voice immediately sounded in his ear, as vivid as if he were standing right by him. Strange, how these little machines worked. ''Hey, Vik. I know you're probably still mad at me, but no time for that now. I need you outside in full gear. You've got forty-seven minutes.''

What? What was this? A prank? Hesitant, he asked for more, not bothering to explain that he wasn't even that mad anymore. ''So, ya want me outside? Why?''

''Damian called us to action. We're raiding, along with the flames.''

Already? ''Sure, be there in twenty. Where we raidin'?''

''Grab a knife from the manufactory before you go. I drafted you a new one, cuts through steel like butter.'' A pause followed, long enough that Viktor began to think Martin had just hung up the call, except for the fact that the call was still showing as ongoing.

''As to what we're raiding. We're hitting them where it'll hurt Vik. We're attacking a tech base of the Ristards.''",1,1756254384.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Advice from a 20f

buy a head wrap they has two sets of heat/cooling packs so one can be freezing while you use the other

Sleep upright, it sucks but it is effective

Take it slow eat what you’re comfortable with

Have that frozen coffee! Just use a spoon it’s no worse than a milkshake if you usually have lots of caffeine 

The anesthesia isn’t scary you will be asleep before you know it

And if you can afford it take extra time off work when needed I took an extra day off and it was great

Happy healing :)

We ended the relationship because of communication problems. Every-time I try to have a conversation with him about the communication problems, our talk would always lead to an argument. I think he was genuinely a good guy who cared for me because of the small things he would do for me when I’m sick, etc. But the constant arguments and the way he feared having serious conversations that would make improvements to our relationships was ruining it for me. And sometimes I would doubt his commitment because of how he would go quiet on some days and claim that he’s being going through some stuff. 
Anyways, fast forward. I texted him for closure because without it, I felt like I was struggling to fully move on because something kept me from not forgetting about him. The conversation led to him saying “he doesn’t want to hear the negative things I have to to stay about him so that we stay on good terms and so that one day in the future, we could both go for coffee and chat and probably even bend me over”.  Which was a crazy thing to say but I was horny and missed him and responded with “we can do that right now”. We ended up hooking up and he told me how much he’s missed me and that’s he’s so happy to see me. I asked him if he meant he missed the sex with me and he told me he missed me in general. After the hookup he dropped me off and asked for a peck on the lips when leaving which really left me confused. He also texted me after dropping me off and the following days after which also left me confused because I didn’t know if this was us getting back together or him just wanting hookups. So I asked and try to have a conversation about it without saying I want him back. I indirectly was beating around the bush to get what was on his mind without him knowing what’s on mine and as usual, it led into an argument. During the argument, I ended up saying “you just hate me” and he responded to it with “no, I love you” and him saying that “I need to learn to be honest and not try to act nonchalant and not really say how I’m feeling”. He also spoke about how everything was going so great and i just had to ruin it with the stunt I pulled which is making him even wonder if this is even worth it. Anyways, as usual, i apologised and he made feel so awful about me just trying to see if we’re on the same page which i hate because it feels like he takes advantage of my feelings and paints me as the bad guy and I’m always having to say sorry.  
We hooked up another time and after this hookup we got to spend the time after together unlike after the first hookup (bc I was busy that day and strictly took it as a hookup). So he put my head on his chest and he got some gummy bears and started to feel me some till they were done. Then after he fell asleep while holding me in his arms. 
We continued talk and he’d make jokes like “don’t worry, while I’m out, I won’t let any women approach me”. He would also get concerned about me hanging out with one of my male friends from my friend group who I kissed after our breakup and he would say stuff like “idk how to feel about him being there with you bc you two once kissed”. 
He also asked me after the first and second hookup if I had sex with anyone else after our breakup and what I’ve been up to lately. I didn’t have sec with anyone during the breakup (hes the only guy I’ve ever had sex with). Though I’d did make out with a few other guys during the breakup he hooked up with someone else. I didn’t tell him about what I was up to during that period though (I’m a really beautiful girl who constantly gets asked out and stuff so I would go on dates and talk to people and some would try to spoil the shit out of me just to get my attention).
Anyways, despite us talking and me having hope about this working out, we never really got to talk about what we’re doing and it’s driving me crazy because I always heard that “if a guy wants you, you wouldn’t doubt it because he would make it clear”. 
My friend also made a comment about how she feels he’s not ready to commit because if he was, he would tell me he wants me & not just go with the flow. She also spoke about how she feels he doesn’t want any other guys with me but isn’t ready to commit himself to me. For a friend to tell me this from the little things I’ve told her, I feel like maybe she sees something. So now I don’t really know what to do bc if I try to talk it out with him, one sure it will lead to an argument because he hates real talk.",1,1756253902.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Dawn licks skyscraper flanks, turning glass veins to liquid gold. The city inhales...taxis bloom like mechanized dandelions, their yellow crowns swarming asphalt meadows. Subways hum basslines beneath concrete, a subterranean pulse thrumming through sidewalk cracks where stubborn petunias fist through stone.  

Steel canyons echo with the staccato gospel of construction, iron seeds planted deep, their girders stretching skyward like chrome saplings. Food carts exhale cumin and burnt sugar, their smoke plumes braiding with office drones cologne into a perfume only the brave breathe deep.  

Rooftop gardens flaunt their jungle riots, ivy scaling fire escapes with outlaw grace. Neon arteries ignite at dusk, bleeding ruby and cobalt into the harbor’s obsidian mirror. A saxophonist’s notes spiral above the gridlock, bending streetlight beams into temporary cathedrals.  

The city never regrets.  

It thrives on stolen sleep and 3 a.m. epiphanies, on bodega coffee and fire-escape constellations. Every crosswalk is a starting line. Every scaffolding a promise.

1n12dbs,https://i.redd.it/dhkxwx0tbglf1.jpeg,Review #8: Laphroaig 10,"**Laphroaig 10 year old**

**ABV: 86 proof (43%)**

**Price: $88**

**Age: 10 years old**

Today's review is on a standard offering from Laphroaig, the 10 year old. Now I've been actually very excited for this review as this offering is quite a divisive figure among whisky heads. Some people either like it or just find it boring. Whatever the case is, this to me is a great beginner offering to give to anyone who is wanting to get into peated whisky. Situated on Islay, and having gone to the distillery, Laphroaig is widely considered one of the big 3. I personally find Laphroaig a bit more earthier than Lagavulin or Ardbeg, with that earthiness pairing absolutely well with the sherry finish (my favourite Laphroaig). With the ex-bourbon influence being strong, it gives a very distinctive flavour among most of the Islay offerings.

**Nose:** Sterotypical Islay smell. That earthy peat comes through very strong with hints of chocolate and orange being present, as well as a slight briny note that is very effervescent.

**Pallate:** As soon as you take a sip, the earthy peat comes in first, with light citrus following along (mix of lemon and orange). This then leads to graham crackers, a strong dark roast coffee, and the aftertaste of a very dark chocolate. 

**Finish:** That peat and coffee carries all the way through with all the other notes dissipating, with the peat eventually overpowering the coffee, leading into a nice long finish.

**Final Thoughts:** As previously stated, this scotch is a divisive figure. It definitely has everything a person will like about a good Islay scotch, just toned a bit. What I will say is this, whether you like it or hate it, this whisky is definitely a go to, especially on my end, as a great beginner whisky for Islay. Personally, I like this scotch, as it's a nice easy sipper for something from Islay. It doesn't do anything special, but it definitely is a good scotch nonetheless. I also personally really like the house style of Laphroaig, as it's a bit different then most Islay offerings. It is coloured and is chill filtered (which I'm not really a fan of) but I can look past that as the overall flavour is actually not bad. But I'm curious to hear your guys's takes on this whisky. Do you either like it, or do you find it boring? I would love to know!

**Score:** 7.1/10

Have you ever read a comment online that was so funny or clever you wished you could buy the person a coffee? My idea is an app for micro-tipping. Imagine being able to click a button next to a Reddit or YouTube comment and instantly send them $0.10 or $0.25.

It's not about big money from one person; it's about 100 people giving a dime to show their appreciation. The commenter gets a nice surprise, and the tipper gets to say a real 'thank you' for making their day better.

If anyone runs with this and makes a fortune, a shout-out would be awesome! Good luck!""




The ""Micro-Tip"" or ""Kudos Coin"" App Idea

The Core Concept: A seamless browser extension and mobile app that allows users to instantly tip small, micro-amounts (e.g., $0.10, $0.25, $1.00) for brilliant, funny, or helpful comments on platforms like Reddit, YouTube, Twitter, and forums.

The Problem It Solves: We've all been there: you're scrolling online and come across a comment so perfectly witty, insightful, or hilarious that it genuinely makes your day. You want to show appreciation beyond an upvote or a ""lol,"" but traditional tipping feels too heavy, and most users aren't looking for direct gifts. There's currently no effortless way to reward these moments of genius.

The Solution: A One-Click ""Thank You"" This platform would integrate directly into your browsing experience. Imagine a small, unintrusive coin or tip jar icon next to comments. With one click, you can send a pre-set micro-tip from your pre-loaded wallet.

· For Tippers: It's a frictionless way to say, ""That was amazing!"" without thinking twice about the cost. Sending $0.10 feels trivial individually, but...
· For Creators: The magic is in the aggregate. If 50 people who found a comment funny each chip in $0.10, the commenter gets a $5 surprise reward for their wit. This adds up significantly for consistently great contributors.

Why It Works:

· Low Barrier to Entry: Tipping $0.10 is almost effortless, making the act of giving feel easy and fun.
· Power of the Crowd: It harnesses the collective appreciation of a community, turning many tiny gestures into a meaningful reward.
· Positive Reinforcement: It encourages and rewards high-quality, positive content instead of rage-bait and negativity.

The blonde girl looks over at him with confusion, tilting her head at his sudden curiosity about her. It had been three days now and not once did he ask for her name or even where she came from. ""You never told me your name."" Scott sips his coffee while waiting for her answer and catches a glimpse of the stoic look in her eyes dropping. ""Names aren't important."" She dismisses and takes a sip from her own coffee, continuing to look out at the street. For three days now this girl has been with him and, despite being only strangers, in their minds they have been married for decades and have spent a lifetime together. They sit in silence, watching the people below scurry out of the way of children hyped up on penny candy. 

""If you won't tell me your name, I'll have to make up one.""

""What if I don't want to have a name?""

""Then I won't make up a name,"" he tells her, braving to take another look at her. The blonde girl has much longer hair than he expected for an eccentric flapper girl like herself. She must keep it pulled up when she is all dolled up and not in a nightgown and big fluffy robe. She watches the people and cars roll by through the slick and snowy roads, refusing to grace him with another word for quite a while. It's almost scary how she can keep her thoughts locked up deep behind her viridescent eyes. ""You can make up a name."" Her gaze stays trained on the dark brown coffee in the mug as she lifts it to her lips.

""Cat.""

""What?""

""You look like a cat so, I'm going to call you Cat.""

""Who said you could call me Cat?""

""May I call you Cat?""

She smiles faintly, offering only a brief glance. ""Yes, you may call me Cat… Only if I can call you Scottie.""

""Absolutely not."" He scoffs at the idea, her sudden enthusiasm admittedly temping him. The couple continue to sit in silence, streets quickly becoming abandoned as snow begins to fall and bury the streets. “It’d be fun to call you Scottie.” She murmurs as she takes another sip of coffee. He stares at her in wonderment. What is this girl? She is a character in one of the dozens of mystery novels sitting on one of Scott's bookshelves. The beautiful widow of a murdered rich man with a dark past. Only this time, he will probably never know it. 
“Are you real?” Scott suddenly asks.
The words were meant to stay in his head in fear of offending her or scaring her off. Of course she is real, right? He had, on several occasions, been able to touch her and be touched by her. Yet there was still that doubt in the back of his mind. Had he really been able to touch her? He couldn’t remember the feel of her skin. Cat turns to face him, her appearance now seeming unreal to him, like when you stare at your reflection for too long. It's hard to know anything when those unnerving eyes of hers pierce his soul.

""Am I?""

“I’m not sure.”

“Try to prove that I am real."" She tells him with her hand outstretched so he can touch her. Scott tentatively reaches out, poking her hand. He can feel her warm flesh, the ridges in her palm, and even the tendons beneath her skin flex under his touch. He shrugs as he pulls his hand back, feeling foolish for doubting the existence of flesh and blood beside him. ""That doesn't prove anything."" She says and shakes her head. ""Think about it. There is no way for me to prove to you that I am real."" The one statement made his head start hurting. Cat giggles at his clear confusion, his facial expression entertaining her more than he’d like. “You’re the strangest person I have ever met and I have met plenty of people. Many of them strange.”

We were at a bar and everyone is drunk. When my boyfriend gets drunk, he gets talkative and easy going. He asked me if he should ask Ella if she would be interested in his friend and I said yeah! He then proceeds to place his hand on her arms while he talks to her with me in front of them. I know it's innocent, but I felt uncomfortable seeing that.

Then we hopped to the next bar and while we're standing there drinking, he looks at her and grabs a bug in her hair. She freaked out jokingly. He could've just said ""There's a bug in your hair"" instead of removing it himself, right?

I know I sound batshit crazy but it just felt romantic to me. I will note this is actually the first time I've ever felt uncomfortable with his interactions with my friends or any other woman.

I had my first seizure in march, it was out of nowhere, i'd never felt anything like it before either so it was quite a surprise. I don't remember the exact details of how i was the days before that, but I had gone out a lot the 2 weekends before, and had pulled multiple nights staying up till 4 or 5 am the previous week, combined with 7 hours of sleep during the week. it happened on a saturday, I had gotten decent sleep the night , about 7 hours. I was out the entire day, standing in the sun etc, I also drank very little water and ate very little food (stupid of me but wasnt ever a problem before). I think it was at around 10 pm, i was quite tired but that was also a normal occurrence so I didnt anything of it. I got back home and sat down, got up to grab something, and sat back down and i was out cold. Second time was a bit similar, it was late may (less than 2 months later) I was sitting in a hot room the whole day, ate well but was still semi dehydrated, and i got up to grab a pair of socks, knelt down to put them on, and was out cold again. third time was beginning of august, so more time had passed compared to the time between the first 2, and I had gone for a run for the first time in a while, pushed myself a bit but i made sure to drink water and ate an adequate meal. I was watching something while drinking a coffee, and seized again. All 3 are similar seizures, i was tired all 3 times before but im also tired a lot of other times.

1n126kx,https://www.reddit.com/r/NamiMains/comments/1n126kx/i_love_nami_lets_love_nami_together/,"i love nami, lets love nami together","warning long post!

hey guys! :) ive been spamming nami in euw ranked and i climbed being stuck from like 50lp to 300lp in just a few days o-o having an 80% wr in my last 20 games with a majority of games feeling like i had really high impact! heres my profile [https://op.gg/lol/summoners/euw/Dumbop-EUW?queue\_type=SOLORANKED](https://op.gg/lol/summoners/euw/Dumbop-EUW?queue_type=SOLORANKED)

been really enjoying the typical aery/resolve, i just full rush mandate ignoring all other items into dark seal + swifties then moonstone with solstice sleigh. being speedy and having nice scaling on my healing. at the end of the game i usually do like 10-20k dmg with 20-30k total healing depending on the game length and stuff

im making this post because i really started feeling like my champ has low impact more often than not because youre forced to just build enchanter every game and just hope your teammates are not terrible. however this is simply a mindblock and i felt like you fishies might relate, so i wanna talk about ways i may have been overcoming this and why i climbed so easily recently (or maybe i just got lucky :p)

first thing... this is debatable but it helps me a lot, is irl. i literally do my entire morning routine and then just a bit before i start playing ill chug some coffee and im ready to go xD however if i happen to feel bleh on that day i will just not play at all. i also just stop playing if i start to lose focus because im kinda low energy generally speaking and ill just full autopilot lmao. you def dont need to do what i do, but having a ritual that works for you to maximise your energy before playing is what my point is. let your food coma go away, drink your coffee if you need to, etc

now for in game...

this tip is really basic but effective, during laning phase, if the wave is coming back to your adc after you both just based and theres nothing to do bot just go mid and spam heals on your mid laner for a bit! give them an e too if theyre about to trade. ive tilted so many enemy mids by doing this and the enemy support meanwhile is just sitting bot getting nothing. just make sure to keep your time short as you should get back to bot esp when the wave will start pushing away from our adc they need you

third thing is lane bush control, unless we're explicitly invading i will at spawn lv 1 run straight bot to the middle bush ward it and then go move to another bush. i only really do this vs engage supps and poke lanes and imo its a lifesaver

fourth, is another huge thing which are early game timings. to keep it simple 2:30-2:45 is when junglers finish 3 camps and might gank bot, 3:15-3:30 is when junglers have finished full clear and will for sure gank bot if they ended on that side. you are typically safe after 3:45 as junglers need to recall to do their next clear. keep this in mind every game, dying to ganks as nami or as any enchanter is really bad! you need levels early game and you are the cornerstone of keeping your adc alive. nami loves attrition, w doing damage and bouncing back to heal. so we want to avoid dying and losing all that beautiful progress

fifth, is summoner spell tracking. personally ive been using porofessors summoner spell tracker (not a promotion ;-; maybe theres other apps that do this too) and i just click the spells used asap but just writing them down in chat works great too like ""ad 8:15"" and then ctrl a + ctrl c to copy and then paste it before objectives or fights. i admit i kinda suck at typing them out so the spell tracker is mostly for my own awareness which is way better than nothing!


next aspect needs its own part i think we can all agree... teammates... the bane of our existences, the uncertain and the potentially volatile where do we even begin?

pings! communicating pings is a surprisingly complex skill, for example if the enemy support is missing do not bother pinging on your lane that enemy support is missing, instead ping directly below the midlaner a danger ping and then ping the enemy support (bard - alive for example), and dont just do it once... for every few seconds theyre missing do it again! we really need the midlaner to know they might be under threat, even if they get ganked they might react faster with your information in mind. another ping is if your jungler ganks bot at 3:30 and the enemy jungler doesnt, immediately ping the area below your top laner and ping the enemy jungler (kha'zix - alive for example), this has saved my top laners quite a few times. i could make a whole guide about just pings honestly

well what if your teammate doesnt listen?... heres my next advice!

you just have to let it go, sometimes people dont listen and pay the price... let bygones be bygones, if youre frustrated thats okay be frustrated in the moment but DONT type because the last thing we want to win is a keyboard fight with our own teammate i admit sometimes ill missing ping my teammate but only ONCE to vent my frustration and then ill be like ""eh whatever, he messed up"" or if both of us messed up being like ""i messed this up too"" and it calms me down for the next situation 



another thing id like to talk about are objectives. its a place where anything and everything can go up or downhill... 

if you have placed all your wards and nothing is about to happen please back asap, getting +4 wards for when the enemy team starts sweeping means you can just dump all your wards back down and essentially win the vision war if the enemy support doesnt also back for more wards eventually. you can actually check how many wards they have by pressing tab! i use this every game to see what they put down and if they need to base 

if you are 100% going to lose an objective unless your jungler pulls off a miracle, just leave asap and place vision where things will happen next instead of wasting time at a dead objective and maybe dying for no reason. back pings help here, i know people may get frustrated but its way better than dying for nothing right?

grubs... do you move? do you stay bot? it all depends! if your adc is really fed, just stay bot or ask adc and top/mid to swap in advance (like the pro play strat). otherwise try to recall before grubs with the wave shoved into enemy tower so it can come back to your adc to make them safer so you can leave. even if your team just gets 1 grubs its perfect as nobody gets the feat progress and no grub minions for the enemy

please do not give atakhan but also dont tunnel vision into it, this objective is INSANE giving the team that gets it an incredible effect that when your team kills an enemy itll slow enemies in a 500 radius by 60% for 1.5 seconds and do 15% current hp physical/magic dmg (depends on dmg type distribution) which just that is insane for winning any teamfight... but on top of that you get a lot of teamwide ad/ap and xp from the 10 or so flowers everyone gets aaaand the gold from killing it. its not game ending like baron, however this will make baron fights extremely favourable for your team




for now thats about all! writing this all down makes me realise just how complicated this game is haha, and honestly everything is worth learning about from items to mechanics (like flash bubble or bubble predicts) to runes to macro... it all adds up tbh! support is heavily a knowledge role in my eyes especially after having played for a team (we're in ukel division 2) ive learned a lot so far and i am still trying to learn more but also be more efficient at everything i know!

i could write like an entire thesis more about league but this post is long enough and the idea really is to provide more food for thought, if you have any please feel free to ask any questions in the comments or in my dms as im sure there could be gaps missing in some of my explanations especially for players not familiar with a lot of these concepts

Anyone ever experience these 2 problems?,"We have a Magnifica Evo that we purchased at full price just over a year ago. For the money, we thought we'd have a machine that we were set with for years. We have cleaned it religiously every single time we have used it since we first took it out of the box. We also are very careful about how we clean every component of the milk frother. We take it apart and physically wash each piece. 

Now when we turn on the machine, it won't let us use the milk frother at all. The light for the frother keeps flashing even after we've washed hot water through it over and over. The reason my husband wanted this machine was for lattes. Otherwise, we can make ""plain coffee"" in any other coffee maker that costs a fraction of this machine and would taste the same. 

The water softener filter light also refuses to turn off even though we replaced the filter exactly as we always have. Considering what the machine cost and the fact that it hasn't been used heavily (maybe a couple times a week), we have been extremely disappointed. We have had to descale it numerous times even though it's not been used heavily, which in and of itself is a process we honestly don't want to keep making time for when we barely get use out of it before being forced to descale it again. 

  
Mentally, this machine has been exhausting instead of being comforting, which is what our intention was. Has anyone else had these problems (with the frother and the filter)?

Dean stood. Where he wasn’t sure. The room didn’t appear to have walls, just a dark fog past the edges of a circular light above him. He couldn’t remember anything he noticed past his surrounding of nothingness. He walked to the edge of the light watching his arm disappear into the dark fog as he extended it. Figuring he had nothing to lose he stepped into it completely.



He looked back at his arms with the same scars as before on them but fresher younger. He was outside a neighborhood with  big houses all in a line. He was in some kind of uniform that he made out the word *siding* on before a voice pulled him away from the observation. He lifted his head seeing the face of a young red headed woman with a button nose and dotted in freckles. She was in a similar uniform that read “Allison windows and siding” just below the collar . She had a clipboard and no building equipment. She was beautiful, he thought. She spoke as Dean watched, missing every word in the confusion of his rebirth. The tail end of her story translated to a language he could finally understand.



“And my birth father… well the only thing I know about him is his last name is Roberts.” 



That name was familiar, he thought. “Um” he replied. Before he could think a car screeched to a stop against the curb yards in front of them. A man's voice full of rage came from the window demanding this woman over. 



“I told you I’m at work” she yelled as she got closer. Dean shivered hard like his spine needed to retreat. He had seen that kind of rage before he couldn’t remember where just knew he had. His knees shook, struggling to hold his still shivering spine. He wanted to speak but he couldn’t. His throat was closing. He swallowed hard as tears welled up in his eyes. Tears like most things in this moment he didn’t understand.



Dean started to fall back catching himself on his back foot. Revealing himself to be back in the light with the fog in front of him. He took a few more steps back to the middle of the light taking deep heavy breaths as he did. His mind raced over what he saw over who he was. His fear began to drown in determination. He turned his back on his original exit point. Stepping confidently into the dark again.



His first step hit the soft ground hard. It shook him but he didn’t stop. The grass had painted lines and numbers on it. Keep moving, I told him as a whisper in his mind. He looked up to see a ball in the shape of the visible parts of an eye flying at him. His body twitched, bringing his hands out above him with no input from himself.  His hands looked young. Baby fat where he saw hair and scars before. The ball felt leathery on his finger tips as another twitch brought the ball cradled into one arm. 



“MOVE ROBERTS” he heard a voice bark. He looked to see the voice coming from an old man covered in muscles and saggy skin. The eye contact from the man led him to believe he was being spoken to, and so he moved. His body pulsed as it flung itself forward. The lines on the ground led to a square at the end which he assumed is where he should be heading



A few figures started sprinting towards him. Children he noticed, using all his might to stay ahead of them. He figured he must also be a child. *Then this is a memory?* The thought came to him he stopped hard in his tracks turning to face the aggressors. He extended a hand to them and before he could say anything else he felt the force of one of them crash into his sternum knocking him flat on his back. Then black. 



He opened his eyes lying on his back looking at the light above. His ribs and core muscles rippled with pain as rolled over onto his hands and knees. *Maybe not a memory.* He crawled forward hoping to escape whatever hell he found himself in. He crawled to the right of his original exit point. Putting one hand out into the darkness feeling a tile floor as he continued. 



The dark once again surrounded him and with a blink he was in a kitchen. White cabinets and grainy blue countertops. The walls were a sterile blue with white floorboards. The tiles below him were white squares with black lines. He felt a cold sensation on his right hand. He noticed a white liquid pooling on the ground around his hands flowing through the black lines like a river. He wanted to think about the liquid but he looked at his hands. He hardly developed the hands of a child but not an infant. *I’m younger?* He began to think



He started to process what could be happening. He felt a hard blow on his already aching ribs causing his arms to give out landing his face in the liquid. With the side of his face on the ground and his ear submerged, he looked up at the attacker. A blonde woman tall, ugly with anger and hate through her face. Her entire jaw moved with each word Dean was unable to hear. She set her foot on the side of his head. Dean used all the might in his small body to push against it but he was merely a child this time and his attacker well she was not. His hearing returned as he felt the force against his head.



“HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES DEAN?” Dean pressed against the increased force with sensing the slightest struggle in the opponent. 

“HOW MANY DID I SAY BE CAREFUL WITH THE MILK?” he didn’t know he wasn’t sure if he was even old enough to remember anything. The force increased. He felt as though his head may explode 



“I don’t know” he pleaded “please I don’t know” it was the first words he heard himself say.



She lifted her foot returning it for another blow on his ribs. He jolted violently trying to ignore the pain getting his arms beneath him before the constraint returned. Snot and tears dripped to the floor as he noticed the woman's head next to his.  He was barely able to notice the hate and fire pouring out of her bright blue eyes before he felt her hand push on his neck.



“WELL YOURE GONNA FUCKING LICK IT UP” she roared as deans face splashed into the liquid below. He resisted again. Pushing with his neck into her hand.

“I SAID LICK IT” her hand pushed harder making deans force seem laughable as his head submerged in the liquid. He started to choke as his head submerged deeper and deeper into the puddle. He started to drown fighting as his body started to slide into the puddle. Then black.



His eyes popped open laying on his chest, limbs thrown out in every direction. The edges of the light had grown. He could see the frames of doorways sitting border to border surrounding him completely. As he considered the moments the lights pulsed making the doorways disappear and reappear. He coughed rolling onto his back watching the borders of the light pull and push away from him. It pulled firmly in shaping around his body. Then pulling around his head before turning off.



Dean's eyes flicked open. He was on a bed and there was a woman on top of him. She was naked. Her body was pale and in a word voluptuous. She put a hand on his face that he initially winced away from. Which he quickly returned to revealing in contact that wasn’t pain. He locked with her longing eyes filled with lust as she danced above him. He was rigid and stiff; he likely hadn’t done this before. As sound returned to him again the grunting and groaning overwhelmed him causing him to be even more rigid. She noticed slowing to a stop.



“Dean?” she said with the softest sweetest voice Dean had ever heard. “Where’d you go baby?”



“I…” he said as she climbed off of him. He sat up next to her avoiding her gaze as he continued “I don’t know”

He turned sitting at the edge of the bed with his elbows resting on his thighs. The night stand had a little rectangle cardboard box and a smaller metal rectangle on top of it. He knew he liked whatever was in there opening it and pulling out a small paper cylinder tube and putting it in his mouth. He fumbled with the little metal boxes flicking it and flicking it. Until the soft hand returned on his back sliding across his shoulder until he felt both arms wrap around him taking the little metal boxes from him. The soft hands flicked the box until a flame came out that Dean gratefully stuck the tube in taking deep tar filled breaths as she spoke.



“Is it your dad again baby?” he looked at the little paper tube in his hand. Tracking the flame at the end to his finger tips down to the little gold ring around one of them. He decided then he could trust her. He didn’t have any other options and who knew where he would wake up next.



“Maybe” he said, blowing smoke into the room.



“Do you want to talk about it?” she said, squeezing softly around him.



“I think so,” he said “do we talk about him often?”



“Just when you come back to me”



“Then maybe we should just enjoy this moment,” he said, turning back to her. She was young and beautiful, her dark hair crawled out of a messy bun as if every hair was perfectly misplaced on it. He wondered what he had done to have such a woman. Maybe he was handsome. Or maybe he was rich but had no real reason to believe either. He leaned his head in making contact with lips that looked as soft as they felt. He closed his eyes to relish the moment and felt 

her touch evaporate. 



He opened his eyes to see a round and greying man across a table from him. His hair was long and his beard existed only on his chin. Dean moved his head around scanning his surroundings. As he did, hair fell in front of his face. His hair. He touched it with fingers. It was blonde, thick and curly. It felt strange in his hands. He looked down, touching a checkered button up he was wearing over a band t-shirt. It also felt strange. He realized everything felt strange.



Not disorientation like before, just strange. He heard the sound of sucking and water bubbling. He looked back at the man that was holding a strange cylindrical glass in his hand filled with water and smoke. He took another long drag filling the area with the sound of gurgling blowing a sweet and vulgar scent in the air.



“Oh shit dude” the greying man coughed for such a time that Dean grew bored waiting for him to continue. “I am so high right now”



Dean just looked at him with pity. He motioned to a can sitting in front of him. 



“Son. grab me another”



He did quickly and as he his jolt had been slower than before. He used all his might to slide a glass door open. His feet slapped against cold tiles as he walked to a fridge that also felt heavy as he swung it open. The cold air wormed its way down his spine releasing in a visible shiver.



He returned to the man with the can in hand. The journey back was equally clumsy and difficult. He placed the can in front of the round greying man who called him son. The man he called father. His father cracked open the can with a hiss. 



“Where was… oh” he belched ”you have a sister”



Dean was somehow aware of this. He knew he was one of six. All of them are equally fractured in time. The thought breezed across his mind and he believed it truthfully. Because I told him it was. *Maybe I can find them.* He thought. No, I told him. And so he forgot the idea



“I have 4 and a brother,” Dean said slowly. Like he was convincing himself.



“No” his father replied “an older one”



“Yes the one i share a mother with” he replied



“No older than her. Her mother ran off when she got pregnant” 



Dean whispered a prayer in the back of his mind that she was safe. Safe from him. He likely wouldn’t remember telling him this. He started to ask what may have become of her when the glass door slid open. He turned to see the hateful eyes of the woman that tried to drown him.  The flames still burned bright in the pupils of her eyes. 

“I told you to cut that hair” she said “it looks disgusting”



“Leave the boy alone” his father replied “he’ll be a man soon some decisions have to be his”



“While he chooses to look disgusting” she sneered “it's a bad reflection of the home.”



Dean looked around the messy patio covered in dirt, cigarette butts, and empty beer cans. He did not remark on this observation. 



“I mean really and take a fucking shower” she continued “ you smell as disgusting as you look.”



“I said leave him THE FUCK ALONE” his father started slowing reachin a roar. He picked up a cup in front of him, launching it at her head. The glass shattered against her skull. It happened so fast that Dean only saw it out of the corner of his eye. He turned to see her hand covering her eye, blood seeped out between her fingers.



“Can’t I have a fuckin opinion?” she screeched.



“What part of that was a fuckin opinion bitch” he replied stomping towards her.



“Hold on guys its not…” Dean stood trying to step between them. “Its not that serious.”



His father moved through him like a bulldozer. Socking him squarely in the gut pushing him to the side. Dean landed hard on concrete and broken glass. His vision got blurry as his father's hands reached the woman. He blinked. Forcing his eyes back open with all his might. Seeing only the dark fog again. 



He stayed on his side and yelled. Nothing particular, just a primal release of pain. He felt it all leave his body. Noticing he was perfectly intact, he stood looking out into the fog wondering where in the hell it would take him next. He was bruised and he was battered but knew he must continue and stepped back into the fog.



He was in a hospital room. There was a woman on the bed.The bed was surrounded by different faces resembling the woman. He took a step closer, placing a hand on the rail of the bed. She had dark hair and bright eyes. Her face was round and immediately welcoming to him. Her mouth was open and a tube was stuck in.  She looked young too young for what he assumed was going to happen.



“We're about to wake her up,” a voice behind him said. He didn't look up, he put his hand on the hand of the patient. He felt a wave of calm and comfort as he did. A woman in scrubs pushed by Dean causing him to take a step back. He watched as the tube slid out of her throat. The patient gagged violently, breathing as if she were running a marathon. 



“Are you comfortable Cera?” the women in scrubs said to Cera on the bed.

Cera continued fighting for each breath raising her arms and extending the middle fingers on each hand. Dean smiled as the others around the bed grabbed her hand fighting to hold them in what were likely her final moments. 



“It okay baby” one of them said 

“You fought for so long sweetheart” another said

“You can let go mom” a woman on the other side of the bed said. She had dark eyes and dark hair like her mother. Dean looked at her. He knew two things about her, she was protective and sorrowful. *Is that my sister?* He thought. Yes, I said. *That means that is…* yes I said. He looked back at the woman fighting for her life. She didn’t want to go. She didn’t want to make them orphans but it was too late. Dean's knees grew weak; he stepped backwards until his back touched a wall. He leaned against it, watching the woman push for breath. Harder and harder and harder. Until she didn’t. He slid down the wall putting his knees against his chest. He sat there for a while trying to figure out how to make this end. He had had enough pain and suffering for one lifetime. 



After the room cleared out he was approached by a man in a white lab coat with black hair he had slicked back. Dean stood to face the man.



“Sorry about your mom kid.” he said 



“I think she went out on her terms” he said “sorry if i gave you any trouble”



He looked surprised by his response. It was a surprising thing for a kid to say but that is what he said. “No, you and your family asked questions. Good questions. Hard questions. For a 19 year old to ask it pushed me to do everything I could. It was clear she lived and died a very loved woman.”



“I believe she was” dean replied 



“Stay as long as you’d like. We won't disturb her until the room is empty.” the doctor replied. Leaving the room.



Dean turned to his mother and pulled up a chair next to her and sat down grabbing her hand. He held it knowing he’d have to leave soon. Hoping he never would. He closed his eyes, pressing his forehead against the back of her hand. Then her touch slipped away.



Dean woke up next in a wooden house looking out the window. His face was wet with tears. His mother was outside with a suitcase in her hand next to an open trunk. She was younger, much younger. Dean placed his hand on the glass. His hand was small and boney; he was nearly an infant. He wailed and wailed while trying to say anything but no words came out. He hadn’t learned how yet. She loaded each bag in the trunk making one final glance back at dean before shutting the door and driving away. He smacked on the glass pleading for her to turn around. She didn’t. The tail lights of the car got blurry as his eyes pooled with more tears. He closed them.



They snapped back open and he was sitting on a soft couch. His hand was cold. He was holding a glass. He looked up from the glass to see a naked woman strewn across a large coffee table. She was covered in tattoos and little white lines of powder. Her hair was short, ending around her neck that was covered in love bruises. She pointed to a line just under breast saying something that Dean couldn’t hear. He assumed this meant he was to do something with it. Which he wasn’t sure. He chose both taking a long drag from a bitter drink and cupping a breast that was too big for his hand. He leaned forward taking a little straw inhaling the powder. A rush blew through his mind, he barely remembered the horrors he saw moments ago. The music in the room kicked to life and the voices around him joined the chorus. This was some kind of party.  He looked back at the women he had yet to let go off. Her face was filled with sinful lust. He didn’t feel much looking at the woman but he didn’t remember much either. He wanted to chase that feeling. So he doubled down. He lifted the breast sliding his tongue against the remnants of the line. He pulled his head back meeting her gaze with equal sinfulness. The disembodied voices cheered as she jumped up grabbing his hand leading him away. He watched the nude woman dragging him towards a door shutting his eyes, imagining the fun he was about to have and feeling her hand fade away. 



His eyes popped open in a beige room with white trim and doors. He was standing on a thick carpet that tickled his toes. The room had two red mattresses directly on the floor and a black dresser with a small box tv on it. A door opened and he saw girls waving him towards them. One of them was his sister from the hospital but only a child now. She looked scared as she desperately motioned for him to follow. He was frozen staring back at her. He tried to pick up his feet but the carpet seemed to be wrapped around them. He heard a bang at the other door and a voice. 



“Why are you hiding children?” his father said through the door. He continued yelling and banging at the door. His words became unintelligible as the more important sound echoed in the room. The door was cracking. His sister ran out grabbing him by the arm pulling through the other door. A white bathroom through and through. She pushed all the children into the tub pulling the curtain closed. She covered them as if to shield them from the imminent strikes with her own body. They all closed their eyes. Dean squeezed them shut praying to take his next leap. He heard the door to the bedroom split open and the stomping of the threat searching for him.*please. Just take me away. I can't keep doing this.Please!* Dean's thoughts pleaded. The threat had found them. The door cracked with each bang each yell. Then he heard it split open. *Please.* He pleaded again. I took mercy on him. His beating would be mine today.



He woke back in the fog under the light in a fetal position. He took a moment to assess his situation. *I can't save them.* No you can't, I said. *Why?* Because you didn’t, I said. *Who are you?* He thought. Look around, I said. He surveyed the edges of the light. Nothing had changed. The light pulsed opening up to the doorways from before. He spun, noticing one of them was a mirror.  He cautiously approached it. He saw a man in his mid twenties with short light brown hair and a moustache. His nose was bent at its ridge. His eyes were bright blue. They were my mothers eyes. He was short, carrying some muscles and a bit of fat. He was wearing a short sleeve white button up open enough to reveal chest hair and a gold ring on a chain around his neck. He was wearing light blue jeans and black dress boots. He moved closer to the reflection, studying every line on his face. He had never seen himself before. He pressed his hand against the glass. 



He thought of the childhood he had. His mother had left him, his step mother had tried to drown him and his father tried to kill them both. He thought about the moments he didn’t have the ones of joy. He knew his life had joy but he had never felt it. Somehow the mother that abandoned him was worth fighting for. Worth loving. His wife loved him, surely there was joy in love but he had been taken away before he felt it. He grew frustrated at all he lost balling his palm against the glass throwing the newly formed fist into the reflection letting out a yell. The glasses shattered all around him as he fell to his knees. 



“Why am I here?” he said looking at his bloody fists. He closed his eyes. Thinking of his hatred for whatever I was. 



“Look up,” I said. 



He opened his eyes to see his fists clear of harm. He tilted his head up to see his reflection still standing looking down at him. He fell onto his rear scooting himself back with his palms. 



“What is this?” Dean said as I stepped out of the mirror. 



“ a story” I said 



“A story?” he said standing. I stepped to his side, throwing a hand on his shoulder and gesturing to the mirror.



“See for yourself,” I said. 



He looked at me with a puzzled expression. He stepped away from me taking a last step into the darkness. He was pulled through it feeling pressure in the back of his legs knocking him onto an office chair. The chair continued to push him through space. He closed his eyes, feeling the movement stop all at once. 



He opened them sitting in front of a laptop on a black desk on a patio. My patio. It had a familiar little cardboard box and black cup. Beyond the desk was a lake surrounded by other stone buildings. He looked to be five or six stories high.  He turned his attention to the cardboard boxes pulling out a little paper tube and taking long breaths and sipping from a bitter drink. He looked at the laptop turning the screen on. A scramble of words littered the screen. He began to read his life's story from start to now.



“This is a terrible story” he said



“I know” I said

**When set times drop my goal is to use the favoriting of an artist to generate a personal schedule view that you can use while you're at the fort transcending. I'm also considering building out the social aspect so that you can link up schedules with friends, or check-in at different stages live so that your crew can meet up.**

This is truly a labor of love. I’ve always had a great time at Making Time and have met so many awesome people. It was fun to build this and I’m happy to share it with you all. If you find it useful there’s a link at the bottom to buy me a coffee. A couple people have and I’m truly grateful! I’m a currently unemployed software developer and could imagine continuing to build this into something other events find useful — but for now I’m happy to do it to scratch my own itch. I tried my best to get tags “right” but I realize that trying to slot these artists into specific buckets doesn’t do them justice - so apologies if anyone is offended by the labels :) 

Feel free to DM me if you see anything egregious or encounter bugs.  Looking forward to transcending with you all.

I don't know the entire story but basically one of my family members was using robinhood and they probably fell for a phishing scam because they got their robinhood hacked and money withdrawn. I never found out if they got the money back or not, but I heard this story a while back when I was a teen and it's made me pretty paranoid about using investment accounts since, whether or not that is rational.

Yes, this may be a bit OCD but I decided that I would buy a separate iPad device that I would ONLY use for my brokerage account. I spent money on a new iPad, and made sure that the only app I had on it was that brokerage account. I also bought data to ensure that I would never have to connect on wifi with that device. I've followed strict protocol ever since of only accessing this brokerage app on my iPad. I don't download any other apps or do any browsing or download files on this iPad to ensure it's safe. 

It's a bit of a hassle because i'm paying for data and an iPad that I only use for my brokerage account, while it would be way more convenient to just download the brokerage app on the iPhone I use everyday. However, in the back of my mind there's always a fear of me getting hacked somehow through software means (I'm not worried about phishing because I never give out my information to ANYONE), i'm more afraid of for example, downloading some kind of virus on my iPhone and then getting my brokerage hacked or having my data intercepted on my personal iPhone by a different app that would give these hackers access to my brokerage account.

I want to get over this irrational fear, in my whole life this is pretty much the only one but I guess the hysterics that came when my family member's account go hacked really affected me. For anyone that reads this the whole way through, I know some of this is irrational and I hope that you don't make fun of me. I just want to learn and get over this fear by getting more information. My questions are:

1. Is it safe to use brokerage apps (like robinhood, Fidelity, etc) on my iPhone that I also use for social media, tiktok, youtube, downloading files for school work, emails, etc? Or should I stick with my iPad method to be safer, where I only use my brokerage on the iPad. Again, I know all about phishing and thats not my worry, but my main concern is my iPhone somehow leaking my brokerage account data or downloading something and getting a virus that allows access to my brokerage account.

2. Is sandboxing a thing with Apple where each app can't have access to other apps data? Someone I asked mentioned that to me.

3. As long as I add 2FA to these brokerage accounts, is there any other security measures I can use to safeguard my brokerage accounts?

4. Lastly, on iOS devices is it safe to connect to Wifi we aren't 100% sure of their safety? For example, wifi from coffee shops or a store? I was told to never connect to wifi that isn't your home's because hackers can access your informaton if you use their wifi. Is this true?

It's a bit of a hassle because i'm paying for data and an iPad that I only use for my brokerage account, while it would be way more convenient to just download the brokerage app on the iPhone I use everyday.

Chain-wrapped tires spat up gravel and ice as the red pickup surged west through the snowy expanse of northern Iowa.  The rust-freckled doors need a heavy boot to kick open or shut.  On the driver's side, the cracked seat leather was worn to a deep burgundy- stained black some places, rubbed a dusty yellow in others.  The passenger seat was almost its original color, which had a bit of a glow to it, like whiskey in a dim light.  

There wasn’t normally a passenger.  

As the truck hummed forward, the warm electric guitar was interrupted by radio static.  Then a tinny voice, and an urgent message coming out of Clear Lake Iowa, about twenty miles behind.  



	“-Six bodies discovered across the midwest in the past week appear to be linked, in a series of cold blooded killings.  Few details have been shared at this point, but police are urging locals to remain vigilant.  A red pickup truck has been spotted near several of the crime scenes. The driver is-”

	He dialed the volume down and leaned forward as his eyes narrowed in on a hitchhiker in the distance.  The driver’s heel quit tapping and dug into the floorboard, tense.  As the truck crept closer, he could see the boy, a golden beam of light shining down on him- it was amazing.  The red pickup eased to a stop as the hitchhiker looked up, squinting into the wind.

“Headed west?” the driver asked in a calm, friendly tone.  

The boy looked in the open window at a strange looking driver.  The kind of man you might see walking down a crowded street, maybe in the car behind you, but you never really notice.  A few feet or a crowd to blend into was all the anonymity the man probably needed.  Proximity though, it revealed something in him.  Something he’d do better to keep hidden.  His features floated somewhere on the edge of familiarity.  It was in the details, the boy noticed.  You follow something along far enough and it's just not right, not human.  His skin wasn’t wrinkled but there was a thick sort of deadness to it, making his age hard to place.  His eyes sat too deep in his skull, like he could see more of you than you could of him.  Greasy, dark hair hung in a neat sort of mess across his forehead, his face was shaven and pale-grey.  The smile he wore was no different from a normal smile in shape and technical movement, but it had the unnamable qualities of a mask.  As the man looked out the open window, he held it taut, stretched across his face.

“Yeah, I was walkin west.”  The boy responded.  His feet shifted, as if they might carry him off.  But the road was cold and endless.  There weren’t any other doors opening his way.   

“Well, driving’s a lot quicker.”  

The boy pulled his coat tight around himself as he looked back up at the man.  He was wrapped in a faded blue flannel stitched with a strange, diamond pattern.  The bone colored lines converged in a way the boy found unpleasant to look at.  Was it a gut feeling or just sleep deprivation?  Was he judging the man so quickly- simply because he was ugly?  

“Hell of a lot warmer too.”  The man added.



The boy slid his bag underneath the passenger seat as he eased back into the soft brown leather.  The smell of stale coffee lingered weakly in the air.  His eyes were heavy.  The wind no longer whistled in his ears- the red pickup was quiet and warm.  To the low rumble of the engine, he began to drift off.  Half asleep, almost fully,  

When the driver spoke again:

“You’re not running away from home, are you?”  In a calm, polite tone.  The boy’s eyelids fluttered open and he thought for a moment.

“No, not running from home…  Just looking for some family.  Out Montana ways.”  He hoped the conversation might end there but the man in the driver's seat was intrigued, rubbing his chin studiously.

“And your plan is hitchhiking there?”   

The boy didn’t answer- clearly he was hitchhiking-  but when the man turned from the road and looked at the boy, he offered a weak shrug.  The man studied him more closely now.  A bit skinnier than he’d imagined.  The boy’s face was soft but angular- like an attractive woman.  His neck was thin and his shoulders were bony, even through the jacket.  His straw-like hair, if it were cleaned, would probably be more of a dirty blonde. It hung in tangled strands, nearly to his shoulders.   In his sunken cheeks and tired eyes the driver recognized a feeling in the boy he knew quite well.  

The boy wasn’t simply travelling alone, 

He was *completely* *alone* in the world.  

“Well, what’ll your mother say about that?”  The driver prodded, almost teasing.  The air was quietly sucked from the boy’s chest.  He took back a shaky breath-

“She’s not gonna say anything.  She’s gone”.  He glanced at the driver then turned back to the window.  A sort of life was breathed into those memories after she died.  Like it’s where her ghost went.  And just the word ‘mother,’ could set off a whirlwind of sensations in the boy.  He would smell her perfume.  Her cooking.  For a fleeting second he was back home, hanging on the porch swing in humid summer air.  He felt the warmth of her head, resting against his shoulder.  Her warm easy laugh, that spread to him as she pointed out constellations, though she knew none.  It was the most perfect and painful memory the boy had.  Then it was gone.

“Gone?”  The driver asked with a gullible innocence.

“Yeah, gone.  Dead,”  The boy replied, his gaze rested on the snow, his head on the window.  He had this dull ache he couldn’t seem to place, pulsing from his knee.  It had been bothering him for a day or two, but when he felt around trying to pinpoint the pain, it seemed to disappear.  After the words hung in the air a few moments too long the man continued.

“-Well, what about your father?”

“Yeah, him too,”  the boy was quick and blunt now, exhaustion rivalling his grief in the warm red pickup.  

“And what happened to them?”  

He was grateful for the ride- but the questions, and not just the questions, the long dramatic pauses between, were beginning to wear on the boy.  He’d rather the man at least spit them out quickly, anything to get the small talk done with.  He sighed and lifted his head from the window again.  The man felt the boy's gaze on the side of his face, but didn’t seem to mind the tension. 

“Listen, I’m real grateful for the ride and all,” the boy said with an honest tone and a forced smile.

“I mean that.  I’m just too damn tired to talk right now, is all.  It’d probably all be nonsense anyways.”  He looked at the man, trying to gauge his expressions.  

“I can tell you about my folks, just let me sleep a minute.”  The boy’s eyes lingered on the man’s face.  He was adjusting his grip on the steering wheel.  

Then a slow nod.  

Burned into the boy’s vision was a faint imprint of the man’s smile, as he leaned back toward the window and drifted off to sleep.

1n11yy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/flankinvesting/comments/1n11yy8/fast_food_has_lagged_the_sp500_their_comeback/,Fast food has lagged the SP500. Their comeback story... beverages?,"Fast‑food chains have struggled with fewer customer visits and sluggish sales since last year. 

The reason for all this: price hikes and to a lesser extent, shifting consumer tastes.

But they have a comeback plan... beverages. 

It makes sense when you think about it. Beverages have higher margins than food, require less labor to make, and have simpler supply chains (and longer shelf life in most cases).

There is plenty of room for growth. Many customers skip drinks when placing meal orders, so it’s an easy boost if they are enticed to add one. Bold flavors and attractive visuals could fuel spontaneous purchases.

**## McDonald’s Leads the Charge**

McDonald's recently announced plans to test a range of cold coffees, fruity refreshers, crafted sodas, and energy drinks in 500 US restaurants, starting next month.

McDonald’s wants to lure customers at all times of the day—from the morning boost to evening. “We’re not just serving drinks—we’re creating new reasons to visit, new ways to enjoy, and new moments to savor,” said Buetikofer.

[image](https://d2qkqhh60b0n0e.cloudfront.net/images/6e06c931-3660-4a8d-8368-c97de5554eda)

**## Rivals Follow Quickly**

Just a day after McDonald’s revealed its beverage expansion, Burger King followed with an announcement of its own—rolling out a summer lineup featuring lemonades and iced coffee topped with flavored cold foam.

Wendy’s joined in as well, adding cold brew with cold foam and fruit-flavored energy drinks to its seasonal menu. “Beverage innovation will be a key enabler of growth across multiple dayparts, especially breakfast and snacking occasions,” interim CEO Ken Cook told investors on a recent earnings call.

Taco Bell has taken an even bolder step. Last December, it opened a “Live Más Café” inside a California location, offering more than 30 signature beverages, from caffeinated aguas frescas to churro-inspired frappes. The concept, the company explained, was designed around Gen Z’s appetite for customized drinks.

[image](https://d2qkqhh60b0n0e.cloudfront.net/images/c588dd99-f176-4d80-9129-51db366bb4ee)

Six months in, the test proved promising: sales at the café jumped 40%, prompting Taco Bell to announce plans for 30 more cafés by year’s end. On top of that, the chain rolled out a nationwide lineup of Refrescas, including a strawberry–passion fruit green tea and a pineapple–lime energy drink. The long-term target: $5 billion in beverage sales by 2030.

**## The Risks**

Novelty and social media buzz can drive short-term hype, but drinks are a “nice-to-have, not a must-have,” warns Neuberger Berman analyst Kevin McCarthy. When budgets tighten, they’re the first item cut.

Operational complexity is another hurdle. Too many customizations can slow service—something even Starbucks had to confront by trimming its menu. “You don’t want to lose a burger customer because someone’s drink order is holding up the drive-thru,” notes BTIG analyst Peter Saleh.

Chains are aware of this. Wendy’s says its new energy drinks run through the existing soda fountain, while cold foam add-ins are simple to execute.

My takeaway from this, take a closer look at Wendy's. The stock is down 38% in the past year, I want to understand why and see if there's an opportunity there. More research to follow!

Parenting multiples is beautiful, but it’s also hard. It’s okay to admit that. It’s okay if the dishes piled up, if bedtime was chaos, or if you had a moment where you just sat and cried. That doesn’t mean you’re failing — it means you’re human.

What matters most is that your little ones are loved. And they are — because of you. Even on days you feel like you’re running on fumes, your babies see you as their safe place, their comfort, their everything.

So if no one told you today: you are doing an amazing job. Truly. Take a deep breath, give yourself grace, and know that this season — as intense as it is — will pass. One day you’ll look back and realize how strong you really were.

1n11xzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1n11xzu/worried_about_my_brokerage_account_while_using/,"Worried About My Brokerage Account While Using iPhone, Need Security Help","For context, I come from an immigrant family where most my extended family comes from a third world country and aren't tech savvy. I don't know the entire story but basically one of my family members was using robinhood and they probably fell for a phishing scam because they got their robinhood hacked and money withdrawn. I never found out if they got the money back or not, but I heard this story a while back when I was a teen and it's made me pretty paranoid about using investment accounts since, whether or not that is rational.

Yes, this may be a bit OCD but I decided that I would buy a separate iPad device that I would ONLY use for my brokerage account. I spent money on a new iPad, and made sure that the only app I had on it was that brokerage account. I also bought data to ensure that I would never have to connect on wifi with that device. I've followed strict protocol ever since of only accessing this brokerage app on my iPad. I don't download any other apps or do any browsing or download files on this iPad to ensure it's safe. 

It's a bit of a hassle because i'm paying for data and an iPad that I only use for my brokerage account, while it would be way more convenient to just download the brokerage app on the iPhone I use everyday. However, in the back of my mind there's always a fear of me getting hacked somehow through software means (I'm not worried about phishing because I never give out my information to ANYONE), i'm more afraid of for example, downloading some kind of virus on my iPhone and then getting my brokerage hacked or having my data intercepted on my personal iPhone by a different app that would give these hackers access to my brokerage account.

I want to get over this irrational fear, in my whole life this is pretty much the only one but I guess the hysterics that came when my family member's account go hacked really affected me. For anyone that reads this the whole way through, I know some of this is irrational and I hope that you don't make fun of me. I just want to learn and get over this fear by getting more information. My questions are:

1. Is it safe to use brokerage apps (like robinhood, Fidelity, etc) on my iPhone that I also use for social media, tiktok, youtube, downloading files for school work, emails, etc? Or should I stick with my iPad method to be safer, where I only use my brokerage on the iPad. Again, I know all about phishing and thats not my worry, but my main concern is my iPhone somehow leaking my brokerage account data or downloading something and getting a virus that allows access to my brokerage account.

2. Is sandboxing a thing with Apple where each app can't have access to other apps data? Someone I asked mentioned that to me.

3. As long as I add 2FA to these brokerage accounts, is there any other security measures I can use to safeguard my brokerage accounts?

4. Lastly, on iOS devices is it safe to connect to Wifi we aren't 100% sure of their safety? For example, wifi from coffee shops or a store? I was told to never connect to wifi that isn't your home's because hackers can access your informaton if you use their wifi. Is this true? I bought data specifically for my iPad so that I never had to connect to data when I checked my brokerage account.",0,1756252473.0,techsupport,5,0.5,False

1n11sow,https://i.redd.it/0o9qfcc3bglf1.png,Free & Affordable Resources,"Coming to State College as an international student can be expensive, but Penn State and the local community offer many free or low-cost resources to help you save money. You’ll find free groceries, meals, clothing, and swag if you know where to look. Below is a guide I wrote to the best places and tips to get free stuff and stretch your budget. 

Campus Food Pantries & Resources

The University Park campus has several food pantries where any Penn State student with a valid PSU ID can get free groceries and essentials. For example, the Lion’s Pantry is PSU’s official food bank; show your student ID and you can shop for food, toiletries, and cleaning supplies. It is open regularly during the week (check their website for hours). You can take the university shuttle to go and take a free lyft home with your groceries if you don’t have a car.

Paw Pantry (UHS): Located on the 2nd floor of University Health Services, this new pantry offers grab-and-go foods, toiletries, laundry items and paper goods, free for any student. 

Pride Pantry (LGBTQ+ Center): The Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (in the HUB) maintains a “Pride Pantry” with snacks, hygiene items, and personal care products that any student can use. Stop by the center at the HUB.

St. Andrew’s Community Café:  St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church (220 W. Foster Ave) runs a free weekly dinner open to everyone. Check their calendar or announcements for the day/time (often Wednesday evenings).

Pasquerilla Spiritual Center: hosts free community lunches on specific days of the week. Check their calendar or announcements for the day/time (used to be Tuesday or Thursday).

Abba Java Coffeehouse:  Next to the St. Paul’s United Methodist Church (Corner of Locust & Calder), this student ministry coffeehouse provides free self-serve coffee and tea, snacks (bread/pastries), and Wi-Fi in a friendly study space. They welcome students any time during open hours, and they often have extra baked goods (like bread) you can take with you.

State College Food Bank: This community food bank (1321 S. Atherton St) helps local residents in need. You may need to apply or register, but it can supplement your groceries. Check their website or contact them for eligibility.

Free Meals & Campus Events

Student organizations and campus ministries frequently serve free meals and giveaways, especially early in the semester. Keep an eye on flyers, bulletin boards, and social media for free meals and giveaways. 

Grace Lutheran Church in the Pasquerilla Spiritual Center hosts a free community dinners. Similarly, Penn State Global, Muslim Student Association, Bridges International, and other groups often hold free dinners during special occasions (like Ramadan or welcome events).

On campus, many events:  club fairs, lectures, cultural festivals, or welcome-week gatherings – include free food and Penn State swag (t-shirts, pens, stickers, etc.) to attract students. To find these:

Check event calendars: Use the Penn State Engagement app or websites like OrgCentral and the Student Affairs events page to see daily events.

Watch timing: Lunch-time (11am–1pm) events often hand out free meals or snacks. Drop in and you’ll usually find pizza, sandwiches, or international treats.

Talk to orgs: Visiting tables in HUB or tents can get you free items (bags, keychains, Nittany Lion plushies, notebooks, etc.) without any catch, they’re giveaways!

Free & Low-Cost Stuff (Clothes, Furniture, Etc.)

Beyond food, you can get a lot of items cheaply or free:

Buy Nothing Groups & Communities: Join Facebook groups like “Buy Nothing State College” (filtered by your neighborhood) where locals post free furniture, appliances, clothes, and housewares. Also look for international student or cultural community groups on WhatsApp/Instagram for tips and free things.

Thrift Stores: Goodwill on Benner Pike and local second-hand stores (e.g. Uptown Cheapskate, Plato’s Closet) have very low prices on clothes, furniture, kitchenware, and more. Dollar Tree ($1.5 items) carries basics like snacks, plastic dishes, cleaning supplies, and stationery. Shopping here can save lots on everyday items.

Clothing Programs: Penn State’s Clothing Transit (career services building) lets students borrow free clothing and accessories. The LGBT Center and some churches also run occasional free clothing drives.

Giveaways & Sales: At the start of each semester, watch for campus “Swap” events and city-wide clearance sales. For example, stores slash prices on Halloween/Easter items right after those holidays. Wait until Nov 1st to buy candy on sale for example.

Buy Back & Returns: Keep receipts. If you buy something (like shoes, electronics, home goods) and change your mind, most stores will let you return it for a refund or exchange within 30–90 days. Returning unused items is a good way to avoid wasting money.

Smart Shopping Tips

Holiday Discounts: The day after major holidays (e.g. Nov 1 after Halloween, or right after Christmas) many seasonal items go 50–75% off. Plan ahead for parties and holidays by waiting to buy until sale days.

Compare Prices: Use apps or websites to compare prices on textbooks or electronics. Often you can rent textbooks, find them used for cheaper, or even in the library for free! 

Student Discounts: Always ask if there’s a student discount. Many local businesses (restaurants, theaters, museums) offer 10% off with your PSU ID.

Buy in Bulk: For essentials like rice, pasta, or toiletries, check Sam's Club (if you have a membership) to save per-unit cost. Just split with roommates if buying bulk packages. Sam's Club Membership offers a deal on the first year with T-mobile where the membership is almost free, it's worth checking. 

Move-Out Season Giveaways

Toward the end of each semester (especially in May and July), look out for free curbside things. Students leaving town often put usable furniture, small appliances, and household items on the sidewalk or donate them. Drive around local neighborhoods or check Goodwill stores, you can get desks, bikes, and kitchenware free or nearly free. 

Free Trips and Excursions

Penn State Global: You can also explore places like New York City, Washington D.C., and Hershey Park for free or at very low cost? Penn State offers free trips and excursions especially for international students through Penn State Global. 
Sign up for the Global Gazette: a weekly newsletter that arrives in your PSU email to learn about those opportunities. It lists upcoming trips, cultural events, and helpful resources for international students. Transportation is usually included (via PSU shuttles), and the trips are either free or very low cost. 

Coupons

Referral Coupons: These are when you refer a friend to be a new user. The new user gets something but who refers it also gets something in return. I have coupons for Discover, Capital One, DoorDash, Lyft, Uber, Speechify, T-Mobile, etc. DM me if you would like any of them!!

1n11sk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1n11sk8/tw_my_mind_has_become_my_hell/,TW: My mind has become my hell.,"Intro:

Hello. I really don’t know how to start this, but I’m fkn doing it. I will preface by inputting, that I have split this up into subsections to organize my thought process and for skim readers to get the highlights. I am a 21 year old female who has survived an extensive DV relationship, that eventually ended with being me in the hospital and a court mandated DVO. This post maybe lengthy, but truthfully, I’m wanting someone, just anyone to hear me; I feel like recently, I’ve been grieving and crying into a void. I guess I’m still scared? It’s been a year since I’ve laid eyes on my abuser, and I still fear that he’s just out there, waiting for me to be vulnerable. 

How I met him:

The abuse I endured from him was evil personified. I should start with the amount of time I knew him. We first started dating when we were in high school (I was 14 he was 17). The situation was already a red flag, given he would turn 18 very soon. After he did, our dates slowly turned into him visiting me late at night for sex and then leaving when he was done. Obviously, this hurt me. This would hurt anyone, especially a 14 year old kid. 

Red flags begin:

Soon, he’d break up with me because I was “too young to date” but he’d still lead me on, so he could come have sex without the commitment; he had succeeded in grooming me to his “standards”. Later, I would go through a full two years of no contact, it was a good time. But, I ran into him at a mutual friend’s house party and he had me under the impression (tale as old as time, right?) that he had changed. At this point, I’m 16 and he’s 19, almost 20 years old. He (an adult) was telling me (a dumb, naive teenager still in school) that he had become a dad, and was raising his child by himself, because the mother abandoned her baby. 

Match made in hell: 

I’m also not going to lie; I was still under the belief that I was in love with him. When he told be about his daughter (18 months old), the little girl in me broke. I’ve always had a mom. I couldn’t imagine a world without my mom. He asked me out, I met his daughter, and I had sealed my fate for the next 3 years. 

Calm before the storm:

Shortly after we reconnected, he asked me to move in. To be fair, that’s not abusive, that’s just a question; although, the timing was very quick. But, there’d be no story or mental breakdowns happening presently if I didn’t accept his offer. I move in with him about 15 mins from my home town, to the town where my parents are employed. Moving with him to that town, although sudden, wasn’t too crazy considering the distance was close and I still had access to my support system (although, at the time me and my mom weren’t on good terms, I was kicked out of her house, so of course I took him up on the offer). Months pass by with me, him and his daughter living together, and he insisted we move to a town 2 hours from anyone I know or love, but he had family there so without consulting me, he cut the preexisting lease, and started a new one in the town 2 hours away. 

Abusive signs begin:

Shortly after we move to the town farther away,  my phone goes missing. I had an iPhone 10, so I suggested we use FindMy to track down where it went. He flew through all the excuses as to why FindMy wouldn’t work for my phone, and that I was simply just “a dumb bitch”, and lost it (found it crammed down the couch where he’d sit, months later and was beat for seeing it). After that, I had to rely on him for communication to the world. He’d tell me I couldn’t talk to my family, friends, or anyone outside of the house. With no phone, I couldn’t call seeking employment, and I knew nobody in the area who could help me. Me and my stepdaughter became super close in this time. She called me “momma”, I called her “doll baby ”. I loved her like she was mine. That was my bestie. I had made a new mini support system. He soon noticed she was more compliant with me, that she liked me, and that we had bonded. He got so jealous , angry, evil or all of them so much so, that he said in front of his own kid “You’re not her mom. She has a mom that left her.” I shattered. I was the only mother this baby ever knew. She shattered, too. I failed at protecting her in that moment, from her own dad. 

It worsens:

A year goes by. It got to a point he’d make her call me by my name; she’d come to me in private and beg me to let her call me mom. I had to pretend what he was doing was okay. I finally got the nerve to ask him why her mom wasn’t around, when doll baby had went to her grandparents. He told me bio mom chose meth over her daughter. He also told me she had a set of twins 9 months after their daughter together, and abandoned them as well. I begged and pleaded with him about the “mom” title, and explained that his daughter cries to me wanting me to be her mom again. He got so mad he hit me for the first time. I was in the laundry room when it happened; he banged my head into the drying machine when I had fallen and was crying. I knew then I was doomed. 

Worst highlights & extra context: 

Another approximate, year goes by. We moved back to the town where my parents work, and I finally reconnect with my family. Physically, I was deteriorating. I weighed 105 lbs (I’m 5’6), I was constantly covered in marks from him drunk/ tweak raging (oh, yeah, forgot to mention he was a nonfunctional alcoholic and a closeted, angry meth addict). He was evil. He broke a brass and glass covered coffee table over my feet, drug me with a car, kicked me out of the car on the hottest day of the year, while I was only in a bikini (he lied an said he was gonna take me to swim at a pool. Also when he beat me and kicked me out of his car, he told me to “make money” for a ride) I was asked all the time, by countless if I was okay. I answered all the time, countlessly “of course”. Another time, I found out through a secret pregnancy test in his car, that he had another baby with his first child’s bio mom, as a product of cheating on me around the time I asked why bio mom didn’t want her daughter. That means, this will be the 4th baby she’s abandoned; with that in mind, I asked him when the other kid was coming to live with us. He replied, “ I don’t give a fuck about that kid.” I can only hope that baby is in a loving home away from people like that. He at the same time was trying to impregnate me when I was asleep, when I wouldn’t conceive, he made me go to the gyno because he was CONVINCED I was pregnant with someone else’s kid. Another form of control was my socialization. My only social time was church, and it was a “privilege” to ask if my parents could attend with me. 

Beginning of the end:

On one of these “privileged” occasions, my mom asked me if I wanted to go shopping with her after the service, I accepted instantly. She took me to a phone store, and bought me an iPhone 14. We got lunch, visited my brother, and drove around for a while. When we arrived at the apartment that me and my ex lived in, my mom asked, “Are you sure you wanna go back there?” I never told her (at this point) what I was going through, but mothers know. My eyes watered, because I knew I was making a bad decision, “I’m going to be just fine.” Famous last words. We hugged, said our ‘I-love-you’s’, and I went inside, to him. As soon as I stepped foot in that apartment, he sensed the phone. I tried showing him that I had just got it and haven’t even made a contact yet; he snapped. He started yelling at me and calling me all the whores in the book. I got scared and went to the bathroom to hide and just breathe. I sat on the tub and he kicked the door down, he beat me with the door, threw a bath-stopper at my head, stomped my face, drug me by my hair up and down the halls; but I managed, miraculously, to dial 911. 
I literally crawled out of that apartment, he was walking behind me just confident as fuck that he was going to get me again. But a neighbor scooped me up and her husband scared off my ex. The police came, the ambulance came, and I was rushed to the hospital. 

Medical& DVO:

In the hospital, I pressed charges on him, the state pressed charges on him, and I was patched up. I received staples in my head, it was ripped open from the blunt force or dragging me around by my hair. I had a bruised hip, 2 broken ribs, both lips busted, no shoes on my feet, and a bald spot on my head.
The DVO was long and stretched out because he definitely still wanted contact with me, but he wasn’t showing up to court or paying his lawyer, plus I had photos and voice recordings, and a Pro Bono Attorney through a survivors program, so my DVO was granted. With that being said I’d like to add, I’m lucky in many aspects, at this point in the story. Many women don’t survive, the ones who do, don’t press charges. The one’s who do press charges, lose their court battle. The ones who win their court battle may have had to pay out of pocket. 



Life now and pontifications:

I’m now almost 22, I have a new, wonderful boyfriend (24) who loves and adores me. He shows me love is gentle, patient and kind. It will be a year on October 5 since I have survived. I’m attempting to rebuild my life, my body, and my mind. There’s still days, that I feel like I’m back at square 1, and that my brain is cursed forever in these disaster loops. 

Listed below are questions I have for the community, answer how you wish. Ask if you wish. I appreciate anyone who has or who would take the time to hear me out about my hurricane of a life. 

• Am I insane for still crying privately over the loss of my stepdaughter? (I know she’s alive, but it’s so wild grieving a living child that you were so connected to.)
• Is it normal to feel like you’re inevitably going to become the abuser? (I’ve never even fist fought someone but I constantly dread this)
• Why do I feel guilty for dating someone kind and gentle?
• Do others feel in danger when faced with confrontation, even if it’s healthy?
• Why do I smell certain things, hear certain things, or feel certain things, and I physically feel like I got beat? (Tense shoulders, sore back, weak legs, and shaky)
• Do I even deserve love? Let alone unconditional. 
• Is it weird to worry whether or not people can “tell” you’ve been abused by a partner? 
• Am I weak for still feeling helpless to that time in my life? 

Again, thank you if anyone in the universe sees this. I have had the hardest time finding community, or just opening up about it all.",2,1756252061.0,domesticviolence,4,1.0,False

My spouse and I are considering a move to the area when I finish school. It will be a few years, but we need something to look forward to lol. I have seen a couple threads on this, but they were at least a year old and didn't highlight some things I am interested in. We are 31 and 30, no kids, 5 pets. Currently live in a small town in southwest GA where I grew up. We lived in New England (Maine) for a couple years and loved many aspects of it. 

What we value- 

-Nature in the way of trails, beaches, access to kayaking. We especially love to swim and do not mind cold water. 
-Access to vegan food (important) 
-places that are not overly crowded 
-Festivals, parades, craft fairs, cute stuff like that (mostly me lol)
-music 
-access to local goods 
-good coffee shops 
-Walkability. This is a luxury we have never had but really want 
-diverse culture 
-we would love to have access to a tortilleria 

Things we loved about living in Maine
old architecture and charming small towns, beautiful drives to beaches, Local vegan ice cream stands/shops, markets with local goods, coffee shops, pop up markets/fairs every weekend in the summer, and lots of trails. Also, honorable mention to Wild Oats in Brunswick. Not a day passes that I do not long for their lattes and muffins. The cons there were the darkness that fell at 4 pm in the winter, many shops closing very early in the day, half of the businesses only being open seasonally, snow didn't fully melt until may, and the insanity of housing costs in the Portland area. So, we would like to have some aspects of what we had there but without the extreme winter and feeling very isolated. 

Before you comment, take note of what we would be coming from. Cons of where we live now- 

-the nearest place to swim (in nature) is 1 hour away and in an area where there is nothing else. There is a lake here, but it is not clean at all

-the weather is HOT and HUMID 

-there is zero walkability and public transportation. No uber. There is a cab service called ""catch-a-cab"", which is sketchy at best lol 

-the surroundings are not exactly aesthetically pleasing. This may sound silly, but when you see desolate looking homes and business every time you leave the house, it starts to feel like life is desolate. 

-the only places to go out here are the two breweries or the pub downtown. The breweries are actually really nice, but we scarcely drink

Your current shaker bottle is a disaster, isn't it?

Let me guess.

It leaks all over your gym bag.

Smells like death after one protein shake.

And your post-workout drink tastes like warm disappointment.

I've been there.

Spent three years buying cheap plastic bottles that promised the world.

All lies.

# Why Most Shaker Bottle Advice Doesn't Work

Here's what nobody tells you about **leak proof protein shaker for gym bag** reviews.

Most are written by people who've never actually used the bottle long-term.

They test it once.

Write a glowing review.

Then go back to their fancy office coffee.

I made every mistake in the book.

Bought the cheapest option on Amazon.

Thought all shakers were the same.

Ignored the material quality.

The result?

Six broken bottles in two years.

Protein powder explosions in my car.

And drinks that tasted like plastic soup.

The truth nobody talks about: **most shaker bottles are designed to break**.

Planned obsolescence in action.

# What Actually Works: Insulated Shaker Bottle Keeps Drinks Cold

After testing 12 different bottles, here's what separates winners from losers:

* **Material matters more than brand** \- Stainless steel beats plastic every time
* **Double-wall insulation isn't just marketing** \- It actually keeps your shake cold for hours
* **The seal is everything** \- If it leaks once, it'll leak forever
* **Weight vs durability trade-off** \- Heavier bottles last longer
* **Storage space is a game-changer** \- Extra compartments eliminate multiple containers

The **BPA free stainless steel shaker** market is flooded with garbage.

But a few bottles actually deliver.

# How to Choose a Shaker Bottle That Doesn't Suck: Step-by-Step

Here's my tested formula for finding the **easy clean protein shaker bottle** that'll last:

https://preview.redd.it/tqgmebu08glf1.jpg?width=1262&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b90c683c9337bbc9b0d314d13ecd724e316c391

**Step 1: Check the Steel Grade** Look for 18/8 stainless steel.

Anything less will rust or taste metallic.

No exceptions.

**Step 2: Verify the Insulation** **Double wall vacuum shaker bottle** tech should keep drinks cold for 8+ hours.

If they can't promise this, skip it.

**Step 3: Test the Seal System** The lid should have multiple seal points.

Single-seal designs fail under pressure.

Physics doesn't lie.

**Step 4: Assess Storage Options** **Shaker bottle with storage compartment** eliminates carrying multiple containers.

Look for at least 3oz extra space.

**Step 5: Check Cleaning Design** Wide mouth opening.

Removable parts.

**Dishwasher safe protein shaker bottle** rating is non-negotiable.

**Step 6: Warranty Investigation** **Lifetime warranty shaker bottle review** standards exist for a reason.

Companies that stand behind products make better products.

Simple.

# Pitfalls That'll Cost You Money

# The ""Cheap and Cheerful"" Trap

Buying £10 plastic bottles every three months costs more than one £40 quality bottle.

Math doesn't lie.

# The ""All Features"" Mistake

Bottles with 20 different compartments usually suck at the basics.

Focus on core function first.

# The ""Brand Loyalty"" Blindspot

Famous fitness brands often rebrand cheap manufacturers.

Check the actual specs, not the logo.

# The ""Size Obsession"" Error

Bigger isn't always better.

A 32oz bottle that doesn't fit in your car cup holder is useless.

# The ""Review Worship"" Problem

Amazon reviews are easily faked.

Look for verified purchases and recent reviews only.

# What Happens When You Get the Right Shaker Bottle

Sarah from Manchester bought a **best stainless steel shaker bottle UK** after reading this advice.

Six months later, she messaged me.

""My protein shake was still cold after a 4-hour hike.""

""No leaks, no smells, no hassle.""

That's what quality looks like.

Your workouts improve when you're not worried about equipment failure.

Your nutrition gets consistent when mixing is effortless.

Your wallet stays fuller when you buy once instead of repeatedly.

The **double wall vacuum shaker bottle** technology keeps drinks at temperature longer than any competitor I've tested.

# FAQs on Best Stainless Steel Shaker Bottle UK

# What makes a shaker bottle truly leak-proof?

Multiple seal points and pressure-tested lids.

Single-seal designs fail when shaken vigorously.

Look for brands that test at 100+ PSI.

# How long should a quality shaker bottle last?

A **BPA free stainless steel shaker** should last 5+ years with daily use.

If yours breaks within 2 years, you bought the wrong one.

# Is the extra weight of steel worth it?

Yes.

630g for years of use beats 200g bottles you replace monthly.

Basic economics.

# Should I buy multiple bottles or just one premium one?

One quality **shaker bottle with storage compartment** eliminates the need for multiple containers.

Simplify your gear, not complicate it.

# Are expensive shakers just marketing hype?

Some are.

But **lifetime warranty shaker bottle review** standards separate quality from marketing.

Companies confident in their products offer lifetime guarantees.

# Final Word: Stop Wasting Money on Garbage

Your fitness journey deserves better than leaky plastic bottles.

The **best stainless steel shaker bottle UK** market has quality options that actually work.

But only if you know what to look for.

Stop buying replacement bottles every few months.

Invest in one that'll outlast your gym membership.

Your future self will thank you when you're drinking ice-cold protein shakes instead of warm plastic soup.

1n11clg,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1n11clg/everything_is_fingers_part_3_final/,Everything is Fingers - PART 3 (FINAL),"Finally, I’d found something familiar-looking, although I didn’t know if I were looking at the back of the Eidelberg or if it were a building that had been designed by the same architect. I stopped and looked around for anything else familiar.

That guy in the trench coat was off to the left with his back against a retaining wall. He was smoking a finger, taking a long drag until it burned down almost to the third knuckle before plucking it away and blowing a pattern of smoke that looked eerily like a gang sign.

He was the one who started all this. My instinct told me to flee, that nothing good was going to come from this, but I was already on the way toward him.

“You,” I said, pointing toward the Eidelberg with a thumb. “You were pointing at me earlier. Why?”

He must have been watching me the entire time from when I spotted him to when I stopped a few feet in front of him. His brow hooded most of his face until he lifted his head. I'd expected his eyes to have been jutting fingertips, but they were just black irises under a buzzing sodium lamp.

He didn’t speak and he may not have been blinking, either. He just stared at me for a few more long seconds before letting his eyes drift off to something in the middle distance.

“Hey, you look at me.” I snapped my fingers in his face. He looked at my hand intensely, then smiled wide, revealing the incomplete set of blocky, deeply-yellowed teeth that began at either side of his mouth.

He laughed, then wiped his mouth. The trench coat was unbuttoned and one side slipped, revealing bare skin, but weird bare skin.

The hand went back in his coat, closing my short view of whatever was going on in there.

“Why did you point at me?”

The smile turned into a half-interested smirk. This could have been ennui, a language barrier, or the man could’ve had a brain made of mashed fingerling potatoes. I considered grabbing him by the lapels and giving him a good shake to see whether that helped.

But before I could move, he took one step forward, opened his trench coat, and said, “Ha!”

It was supposed to be a flash. Maybe that was why he liked to hang around here. But it was all fingers from his collarbone down. Long ones, short ones, gnarled, manicured, some with painted nails—like he’d collected them from anybody who’d had one or two to spare. Skinny fingers as long as my forearm wiggled out of his beard. Save for the clusters of tiny fingers that didn’t appear fully formed, starting at the edges of his pecs and trailing down to his hips, they all twisted, curled, or stretched to point at me.

Even the thatch of pubic hair had wire fingers coming out of it, like someone was standing behind him and was about to pick him up by the crotch. The tiny fingers were like cilia, gently swaying in a pattern like each one was signaling for me to come closer.

This was by far the scariest of anything I’d seen tonight, but I was too mentally exhausted for the flight part of fight-or-flight. I punched him.

He fell back against the retaining wall, and emboldened, I stepped closer and kicked him in the stomach. Several of the fingers broke and that was a very satisfying sound. I’d connected with about a dozen which were pointing everywhere *except* at me. I didn’t know whether this was all his fault, but I took it out on him anyway.

I’d like to say I blanked out. That my mind snapped and I couldn’t control what my body was doing. But no, I was fully conscious of everything. Even when I knocked him to the ground and spotted a chunk of concrete about a foot away from his head. I picked up the mostly intact cinder block and brought it down on his head.

I did that a few more times before doing the same all over his body, making sure to break as many fingers as I could. Even the particularly freaky baby ones. I smashed all I could until I was too tired to pick the block up. The fingers I hadn’t broken shrank back into his flesh. The rest hung uselessly.

I left the block on his chest. I didn’t feel bad about what I’d done, but I'd broken a promise to myself that I'd never get in a situation like this again.

Nobody was around, at least as far as I could see. I didn’t have the energy or the inclination to climb the retaining wall, and it was a pretty safe bet that was the Eidelberg behind me. Going around it would take more time than I was willing to give, so I tried the back door.

It was open.

I really wasn’t familiar with the building, so it took a bunch of right turns before I found the atrium, and from there, spotting the lobby was easy. I pushed my way out those doors for, hopefully, the second and final time. There were people outside, but they were doing things that didn’t involve looking at me, so I didn’t care. I crossed the street, got in my car, and drove off as I was putting on my seatbelt.

The journey home was as boring as I could’ve hoped for. I wasn’t supposed to use my phone while I was driving, but I had to know whether my wife had called or tried to message me.

‘B HOME SOON?’ she’d texted almost an hour ago. I looked at the time. It wasn’t as late as I’d guessed.

I responded that I had gotten held up with something at work. A lie, but the truth would go down much easier with pizza. I ordered from a place on the way.

There was nothing extraordinary about the restaurant, the person who took my payment, nor the pizza itself. I breathed like it was the first time I’d tasted air and got back in my car. I felt good again.

My wife answered the door in something sexy. Life was already eighty-percent better. I tossed the pizza box on the coffee table and let her lead me upstairs.

She kissed me right outside the bedroom. Her mouth was sweet, but I couldn’t place the flavor. It was nice, though. We continued kissing and squeezing parts of each other until I scooped her up and tossed her onto the bed. This was *exactly* what I needed.

Then her face began changing. I couldn’t tell what it was at first, but the transformation was fast. I had already dropped trou and stood in horror with a puddle of pants around my ankles.

In seconds, her entire upper body had shifted into a giant finger. It wasn’t like one of those sexy werewolf transformations like in the movies. I almost threw up. She opened her legs in invitation. It kind of looked like that thing boys used to do when two of them put their palms together and connect them, vertical to horizontal, and the horizontal one would spread his hands to see the faux vagina they’d made.

I took a step back, not able to process the information my eyes were transmitting to my brain. I looked down at my erection.

It was pointed at me, and of course, was a finger. A bigger than average one, but that was hardly comforting.

I must have fainted after that because I woke up here.

I've had nothing but time to think since then. Nothing to do but pretend to get better and keep retelling this story to myself. I have to keep the details as sharp as possible so I can be ready.

*Pretend* to get better isn’t exactly true. I do have work to do. They gave me soft white mitts to wear so I don’t wake up screaming when I see my hands. Once, I was able to get a plastic knife and I tried to saw my left hand off. I didn’t make it very far, but it was the effort that counted.

Part of my therapy involves sitting in a controlled environment where I sit and remove one of the mittens and just stare at my own fingers. The doctors call this condition somatoparaphrenia. They have me say what I want my hand to do and then do it as a means of reteaching my brain that these are indeed my fingers.

My wife comes sometimes. She looks like she used to—not like a finger, that is—but I honestly have difficulty touching her, at times. When I was killing the man in the trench coat, his skin hadn’t felt right. Pliant in the way skin wasn’t supposed to be. Wrong like Gee’s skin had been wrong. Like had I’d pushed hard enough, my hand would have gone right into him. Right through him. I didn’t want to touch her and feel *her* skin like that. Seeing her that way had broken me up good, like a sledgehammer to a cinderblock. The one good thing about being in here was the people helping me piece me back together.

I wanted to touch her. But I couldn’t do anything that involved hands with my wife.

Even though I’m getting better, this isn't over. The pendulum is just swinging in the other direction. For anyone paying attention, you may already know what's coming next. I got a clue, then passed it to you one thousand, four hundred, ninety-five words into this story, then a couple more times after.

I listen and watch to get a better color of what it'll be. It’ll start with people. It’ll start with flesh. But as they change, I’m changing. I’m getting ready. I’ll learn how to act like people again. My wife thinks I’m getting better, and I’m using her to mold this new face. The sooner I get “better,” the better.

I could leave anytime I want. But what happened that night really did do a number on me. I mean, I *killed* a guy.

This therapist talks a lot more than she listens. I wouldn't waste my time trying to convince her something was coming. Especially after what she just did.

“You think you could just stop, close your eyes, and take a deep breath the next time you start seeing all those extra fingers?” she’d asked just a minute before.

“Yeah,” I’d said. That first night, I said all kinds of things—*that were true*—that I regret now because they were using that against me. Obviously, they didn’t believe me. But also, because they didn’t care enough to get what I’d said right. I didn’t say ‘extra’ fingers. I said fingers where they weren’t supposed to be. The fingers were real. Flesh, and everything else had all exchanged atoms with something from some sort of side-universe where everything there was a finger. Fingers that had all come to this universe to point at me. Even my... my... y’know. It still almost makes me scream when I think about it too long. 

I'd touched some of those fingers, felt the change beneath the surface of skin. 

I'd *killed* that man after he'd opened up like a curio cabinet full of phalanges. It was curious that nobody had mentioned him despite me leaving his body behind the Eidelberg. It’s not like I’d even tried to clean up behind myself.

But this therapist was maybe telling me that that ol’ pendulum had finally begun swinging back this way and it was a matter of time before it got a second chance at me.

She gave me a thumb’s up.

1n11bl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1n11bl0/everything_is_fingers_part_3_final/,Everything is Fingers - PART 3 (FINAL),"Finally, I’d found something familiar-looking, although I didn’t know if I were looking at the back of the Eidelberg or if it were a building that had been designed by the same architect. I stopped and looked around for anything else familiar.

That guy in the trench coat was off to the left with his back against a retaining wall. He was smoking a finger, taking a long drag until it burned down almost to the third knuckle before plucking it away and blowing a pattern of smoke that looked eerily like a gang sign.

He was the one who started all this. My instinct told me to flee, that nothing good was going to come from this, but I was already on the way toward him.

“You,” I said, pointing toward the Eidelberg with a thumb. “You were pointing at me earlier. Why?”

He must have been watching me the entire time from when I spotted him to when I stopped a few feet in front of him. His brow hooded most of his face until he lifted his head. I'd expected his eyes to have been jutting fingertips, but they were just black irises under a buzzing sodium lamp.

He didn’t speak and he may not have been blinking, either. He just stared at me for a few more long seconds before letting his eyes drift off to something in the middle distance.

“Hey, you look at me.” I snapped my fingers in his face. He looked at my hand intensely, then smiled wide, revealing the incomplete set of blocky, deeply-yellowed teeth that began at either side of his mouth.

He laughed, then wiped his mouth. The trench coat was unbuttoned and one side slipped, revealing bare skin, but weird bare skin.

The hand went back in his coat, closing my short view of whatever was going on in there.

“Why did you point at me?”

The smile turned into a half-interested smirk. This could have been ennui, a language barrier, or the man could’ve had a brain made of mashed fingerling potatoes. I considered grabbing him by the lapels and giving him a good shake to see whether that helped.

But before I could move, he took one step forward, opened his trench coat, and said, “Ha!”

It was supposed to be a flash. Maybe that was why he liked to hang around here. But it was all fingers from his collarbone down. Long ones, short ones, gnarled, manicured, some with painted nails—like he’d collected them from anybody who’d had one or two to spare. Skinny fingers as long as my forearm wiggled out of his beard. Save for the clusters of tiny fingers that didn’t appear fully formed, starting at the edges of his pecs and trailing down to his hips, they all twisted, curled, or stretched to point at me.

Even the thatch of pubic hair had wire fingers coming out of it, like someone was standing behind him and was about to pick him up by the crotch. The tiny fingers were like cilia, gently swaying in a pattern like each one was signaling for me to come closer.

This was by far the scariest of anything I’d seen tonight, but I was too mentally exhausted for the flight part of fight-or-flight. I punched him.

He fell back against the retaining wall, and emboldened, I stepped closer and kicked him in the stomach. Several of the fingers broke and that was a very satisfying sound. I’d connected with about a dozen which were pointing everywhere *except* at me. I didn’t know whether this was all his fault, but I took it out on him anyway.

I’d like to say I blanked out. That my mind snapped and I couldn’t control what my body was doing. But no, I was fully conscious of everything. Even when I knocked him to the ground and spotted a chunk of concrete about a foot away from his head. I picked up the mostly intact cinder block and brought it down on his head.

I did that a few more times before doing the same all over his body, making sure to break as many fingers as I could. Even the particularly freaky baby ones. I smashed all I could until I was too tired to pick the block up. The fingers I hadn’t broken shrank back into his flesh. The rest hung uselessly.

I left the block on his chest. I didn’t feel bad about what I’d done, but I'd broken a promise to myself that I'd never get in a situation like this again.

Nobody was around, at least as far as I could see. I didn’t have the energy or the inclination to climb the retaining wall, and it was a pretty safe bet that was the Eidelberg behind me. Going around it would take more time than I was willing to give, so I tried the back door.

It was open.

I really wasn’t familiar with the building, so it took a bunch of right turns before I found the atrium, and from there, spotting the lobby was easy. I pushed my way out those doors for, hopefully, the second and final time. There were people outside, but they were doing things that didn’t involve looking at me, so I didn’t care. I crossed the street, got in my car, and drove off as I was putting on my seatbelt.

The journey home was as boring as I could’ve hoped for. I wasn’t supposed to use my phone while I was driving, but I had to know whether my wife had called or tried to message me.

‘B HOME SOON?’ she’d texted almost an hour ago. I looked at the time. It wasn’t as late as I’d guessed.

I responded that I had gotten held up with something at work. A lie, but the truth would go down much easier with pizza. I ordered from a place on the way.

There was nothing extraordinary about the restaurant, the person who took my payment, nor the pizza itself. I breathed like it was the first time I’d tasted air and got back in my car. I felt good again.

My wife answered the door in something sexy. Life was already eighty-percent better. I tossed the pizza box on the coffee table and let her lead me upstairs.

She kissed me right outside the bedroom. Her mouth was sweet, but I couldn’t place the flavor. It was nice, though. We continued kissing and squeezing parts of each other until I scooped her up and tossed her onto the bed. This was *exactly* what I needed.

Then her face began changing. I couldn’t tell what it was at first, but the transformation was fast. I had already dropped trou and stood in horror with a puddle of pants around my ankles.

In seconds, her entire upper body had shifted into a giant finger. It wasn’t like one of those sexy werewolf transformations like in the movies. I almost threw up. She opened her legs in invitation. It kind of looked like that thing boys used to do when two of them put their palms together and connect them, vertical to horizontal, and the horizontal one would spread his hands to see the faux vagina they’d made.

I took a step back, not able to process the information my eyes were transmitting to my brain. I looked down at my erection.

It was pointed at me, and of course, was a finger. A bigger than average one, but that was hardly comforting.

I must have fainted after that because I woke up here.

I've had nothing but time to think since then. Nothing to do but pretend to get better and keep retelling this story to myself. I have to keep the details as sharp as possible so I can be ready.

*Pretend* to get better isn’t exactly true. I do have work to do. They gave me soft white mitts to wear so I don’t wake up screaming when I see my hands. Once, I was able to get a plastic knife and I tried to saw my left hand off. I didn’t make it very far, but it was the effort that counted.

Part of my therapy involves sitting in a controlled environment where I sit and remove one of the mittens and just stare at my own fingers. The doctors call this condition somatoparaphrenia. They have me say what I want my hand to do and then do it as a means of reteaching my brain that these are indeed my fingers.

My wife comes sometimes. She looks like she used to—not like a finger, that is—but I honestly have difficulty touching her, at times. When I was killing the man in the trench coat, his skin hadn’t felt right. Pliant in the way skin wasn’t supposed to be. Wrong like Gee’s skin had been wrong. Like had I’d pushed hard enough, my hand would have gone right into him. Right through him. I didn’t want to touch her and feel *her* skin like that. Seeing her that way had broken me up good, like a sledgehammer to a cinderblock. The one good thing about being in here was the people helping me piece me back together.

I wanted to touch her. But I couldn’t do anything that involved hands with my wife.

Even though I’m getting better, this isn't over. The pendulum is just swinging in the other direction. For anyone paying attention, you may already know what's coming next. I got a clue, then passed it to you one thousand, four hundred, ninety-five words into this story, then a couple more times after.

I listen and watch to get a better color of what it'll be. It’ll start with people. It’ll start with flesh. But as they change, I’m changing. I’m getting ready. I’ll learn how to act like people again. My wife thinks I’m getting better, and I’m using her to mold this new face. The sooner I get “better,” the better.

I could leave anytime I want. But what happened that night really did do a number on me. I mean, I *killed* a guy.

This therapist talks a lot more than she listens. I wouldn't waste my time trying to convince her something was coming. Especially after what she just did.

“You think you could just stop, close your eyes, and take a deep breath the next time you start seeing all those extra fingers?” she’d asked just a minute before.

“Yeah,” I’d said. That first night, I said all kinds of things—*that were true*—that I regret now because they were using that against me. Obviously, they didn’t believe me. But also, because they didn’t care enough to get what I’d said right. I didn’t say ‘extra’ fingers. I said fingers where they weren’t supposed to be. The fingers were real. Flesh, and everything else had all exchanged atoms with something from some sort of side-universe where everything there was a finger. Fingers that had all come to this universe to point at me. Even my... my... y’know. It still almost makes me scream when I think about it too long. 

I'd touched some of those fingers, felt the change beneath the surface of skin. 

I'd *killed* that man after he'd opened up like a curio cabinet full of phalanges. It was curious that nobody had mentioned him despite me leaving his body behind the Eidelberg. It’s not like I’d even tried to clean up behind myself.

But this therapist was maybe telling me that that ol’ pendulum had finally begun swinging back this way and it was a matter of time before it got a second chance at me.

She gave me a thumb’s up.

My brain is still recovering and I’m at the lowest I’ve ever been mentally. 

I was seizure and med free for a decade. I tried to watch my home cameras to count the seizures before I had the stroke and didn’t wake up but I couldn’t. My dogs were so distraught they started to tear the floor up around me and my youngest quite literally stripped me of my clothing. I’m the person who never answers their phone but will at least text. It’s by some miracle my friend and mom both had bad feelings after an hour and a half of no response from me and they got here minutes apart and called 911. Between their time guesses and my cameras, it looks like I was down 2 hours and I still have no idea how I’m alive. 

It appears I had a lot of GM seizures without much, if any, recovery time. It notes my pupils were “fixed and blown” and I was laying in every type of waste a body can produce. I seized several more times for 1-2 minutes each time in the ambulance. ICU notes I had a right gaze preference. 

I had a left M2 branch occlusion (ischemic stroke). 

While unconscious the first 2 weeks, I experienced hell and what was going on around me was impacting my unconscious mind. It was like being physically tortured and I felt pain, thought they were trying to kill me and much more. I had two nurses talk to me during this period and explain what was going on and I can’t imagine how worse the trauma would be had it not been for them. 

Once I woke up, I was asked why I was there, I said a car accident. I got my age wrong, I had no idea where I was, and despite having a PICC, NG tube and was just extubated — I was asking where my coffee thermos was so I can go home because I called my ride (I did not, as I didn’t even have my phone until the 3rd week). 

I can walk, well, shuffle short distances now. Went from 2 pills a day to 32. Lost my license for a year obvious reasons (just bought a brand new car 3 months ago). I have a whole pack of working canines (Malinois) that I can’t work daily as I was. I’m just stressed but the ICU thing really messed me up. Like, I think I have PTSD. I’ve had only nightmares since I was hospitalized. I’m not sleeping well now because I’m afraid to. 

I know Status Epilepticus isn’t common, much less my experience, but I’m hoping if anyone can’t give me advice — that someone learns from what I’m about to say.

If you work in healthcare or ever have a loved one who is in the ICU, intubated, unconscious/comatosed; **talk to them** and calmly explain what happened, where they are, etc. 

I don’t even want to go into the medical neglect once I was coherent. I can’t even articulate how helpless I felt struggling to speak because I couldn’t advocate for myself and was being intentionally left in my own waste that left me with open wounds that needed minor surgery. 

I don’t even know if therapy would help me get over this. ☹️ ",2,1756250782.0,Epilepsy,2,1.0,False

I really wasn’t familiar with the building, so it took a bunch of right turns before I found the atrium, and from there, spotting the lobby was easy. I pushed my way out those doors for, hopefully, the second and final time. There were people outside, but they were doing things that didn’t involve looking at me, so I didn’t care. I crossed the street, got in my car, and drove off as I was putting on my seatbelt.

The journey home was as boring as I could’ve hoped for. I wasn’t supposed to use my phone while I was driving, but I had to know whether my wife had called or tried to message me.

‘B HOME SOON?’ she’d texted almost an hour ago. I looked at the time. It wasn’t as late as I’d guessed.

I responded that I had gotten held up with something at work. A lie, but the truth would go down much easier with pizza. I ordered from a place on the way.

There was nothing extraordinary about the restaurant, the person who took my payment, nor the pizza itself. I breathed like it was the first time I’d tasted air and got back in my car. I felt good again.

My wife answered the door in something sexy. Life was already eighty-percent better. I tossed the pizza box on the coffee table and let her lead me upstairs.

She kissed me right outside the bedroom. Her mouth was sweet, but I couldn’t place the flavor. It was nice, though. We continued kissing and squeezing parts of each other until I scooped her up and tossed her onto the bed. This was *exactly* what I needed.

Then her face began changing. I couldn’t tell what it was at first, but the transformation was fast. I had already dropped trou and stood in horror with a puddle of pants around my ankles.

In seconds, her entire upper body had shifted into a giant finger. It wasn’t like one of those sexy werewolf transformations like in the movies. I almost threw up. She opened her legs in invitation. It kind of looked like that thing boys used to do when two of them put their palms together and connect them, vertical to horizontal, and the horizontal one would spread his hands to see the faux vagina they’d made.

I took a step back, not able to process the information my eyes were transmitting to my brain. I looked down at my erection.

It was pointed at me, and of course, was a finger. A bigger than average one, but that was hardly comforting.

I must have fainted after that because I woke up here.

I've had nothing but time to think since then. Nothing to do but pretend to get better and keep retelling this story to myself. I have to keep the details as sharp as possible so I can be ready.

*Pretend* to get better isn’t exactly true. I do have work to do. They gave me soft white mitts to wear so I don’t wake up screaming when I see my hands. Once, I was able to get a plastic knife and I tried to saw my left hand off. I didn’t make it very far, but it was the effort that counted.

Part of my therapy involves sitting in a controlled environment where I sit and remove one of the mittens and just stare at my own fingers. The doctors call this condition somatoparaphrenia. They have me say what I want my hand to do and then do it as a means of reteaching my brain that these are indeed my fingers.

My wife comes sometimes. She looks like she used to—not like a finger, that is—but I honestly have difficulty touching her, at times. When I was killing the man in the trench coat, his skin hadn’t felt right. Pliant in the way skin wasn’t supposed to be. Wrong like Gee’s skin had been wrong. Like had I’d pushed hard enough, my hand would have gone right into him. Right through him. I didn’t want to touch her and feel *her* skin like that. Seeing her that way had broken me up good, like a sledgehammer to a cinderblock. The one good thing about being in here was the people helping me piece me back together.

I wanted to touch her. But I couldn’t do anything that involved hands with my wife.

Even though I’m getting better, this isn't over. The pendulum is just swinging in the other direction. For anyone paying attention, you may already know what's coming next. I got a clue, then passed it to you one thousand, four hundred, ninety-five words into this story, then a couple more times after.

I listen and watch to get a better color of what it'll be. It’ll start with people. It’ll start with flesh. But as they change, I’m changing. I’m getting ready. I’ll learn how to act like people again. My wife thinks I’m getting better, and I’m using her to mold this new face. The sooner I get “better,” the better.

I could leave anytime I want. But what happened that night really did do a number on me. I mean, I *killed* a guy.

This therapist talks a lot more than she listens. I wouldn't waste my time trying to convince her something was coming. Especially after what she just did.

“You think you could just stop, close your eyes, and take a deep breath the next time you start seeing all those extra fingers?” she’d asked just a minute before.

“Yeah,” I’d said. That first night, I said all kinds of things—*that were true*—that I regret now because they were using that against me. Obviously, they didn’t believe me. But also, because they didn’t care enough to get what I’d said right. I didn’t say ‘extra’ fingers. I said fingers where they weren’t supposed to be. The fingers were real. Flesh, and everything else had all exchanged atoms with something from some sort of side-universe where everything there was a finger. Fingers that had all come to this universe to point at me. Even my... my... y’know. It still almost makes me scream when I think about it too long. 

I'd touched some of those fingers, felt the change beneath the surface of skin. 

I'd *killed* that man after he'd opened up like a curio cabinet full of phalanges. It was curious that nobody had mentioned him despite me leaving his body behind the Eidelberg. It’s not like I’d even tried to clean up behind myself.

But this therapist was maybe telling me that that ol’ pendulum had finally begun swinging back this way and it was a matter of time before it got a second chance at me.

She gave me a thumb’s up.

Coffee only made me crash harder, and I started thinking maybe that’s just adulthood.

But over the past couple months I’ve made a few small changes that, together, have been a game-changer:

1) Getting outside in the mornings (even just for 10–15 minutes of walking or fresh air)

2) Actually eating breakfast instead of surviving on coffee until noon

3) Paying attention to some nutrients I’d ignored before (turns out even “basic” vitamins/minerals can make a difference when you’re low)

Setting a real bedtime instead of scrolling until midnight

None of this is revolutionary, but the combo has completely changed how my days feel. I can actually get through afternoons without that foggy slump, and I’ve even picked up reading again because my focus is back.

My girlfriend of 7 years is sometimes drinking secretly. I will find bottles of liquor in the back of the cabinet and all sorts of other places. However this only happens every now and then. I always thought she only did this sometimes as we usually spend all day with each other and when she is drunk I usually notice the smell/behaviour. 
If she has a stressful time the drinking would increase but there are weeks in which she doesn’t drink at all. (At least not to my knowledge) She rarely gets really drunk but it is still alarming to me that she does it with hard liquor and always denies having drank when I ask her. (If I go looking while she is in the bathroom I will find the alcohol though.) 
We have often fought about this because she gets extremely defensive and just says that she can simply not drink at all for a month if it bothers me so much. 
To be honest it does bother me so much… My girlfriend is the best person I know and is a funny, loving and generous woman that I cannot even imagine living without. But that person disappears when she drinks. She is disagreeable, unhappy and sometimes cruel (with words) when she drinks. 
The issue is that her drinking isn’t really effecting her negatively and she would never admit having a problem with alcohol. She doesn’t get hungover much, has way more energy than I do and is a hard worker. 
Now we are on holiday and we had a beer in the hot tub tonight. But after coming out of the shower I noticed she was quite drunk. So I asked her if she had had any liquor which she denied. Again I found an empty bottle of gin in the cupboard that I had not had a single sip of and next to it was a coffee mug that still had some leftover gin in it. 
So she must have drank multiple times the last days and I did not notice. But even after telling her what I found she still denied having drank the gin. This scares the living shit out of me. This is the woman I want to marry and have kids with. But this is now the second time in this holiday that she did this. Last time she even had to throw up. 
Am I overreacting here or possibly underestimating the issue because I don’t want to face the music.
How can I talk to her about this in a way that shows I don’t judge her or dislike her? 
I‘m sorry for dumping this on you guys but I don’t know where to turn to. I can’t talk about this to my friends or family as it would feel like I‘m betraying her. But I feel so helpless right know…",11,1756250214.0,AlAnon,16,1.0,False

Nobody brags about building it. It’s not some flashy SaaS, or a viral TikTok shop, or a “look-at-me-I’m-rich” dropshipping store. It’s… embarrassingly simple.

And that’s the magic.

Because every time I check my balance and see another $20 (sometimes $40, sometimes $60, depending on the day) drop into my account, I laugh. It’s like this little secret hustle just humming in the background while I’m making coffee, scrolling Twitter, or forgetting to reply to WhatsApp messages from friends.

The crazy part? I built it once. And then it just… kept going.

# The product? You’d never guess.

Here’s where most people roll their eyes: it’s a digital cheat sheet. Not a 200-page book. Not a high-ticket coaching course. A simple, tightly-packed PDF I made in a weekend.

I priced it at $9. Later bumped it to $12. Then $17. Now it floats between $19 and $20 depending on the promo.

That’s it.

Twenty bucks. People hand it over, over and over again, because the value is *insanely concentrated*. You could almost miss it, because the secret isn’t the format — it’s how you package it.

Most creators out there drown people with fluff. 50-page ebooks that could’ve been two pages. Or bloated courses where half the modules are just someone talking to hear themselves speak. Nobody wants that. People crave shortcuts.

A shortcut disguised as a product is worth *ten times* the price.

# Why it works and keeps working

There are three ingredients I swear by:

1. **Solve a micro-problem.** Not “how to start a business” (ugh, too vague). Instead: “how to get your first client on Upwork without any reviews.” Hyper-specific. That’s what gets buyers leaning forward.
2. **Package it like a dopamine shot.** Pretty design? Meh. Fancy branding? Forget it. Instead: I stripped the content down into bullet points, checklists, and plug-and-play examples. People don’t want to read — they want to copy-paste, apply, and see results.
3. **Forget perfection.** The first version of my cheat sheet looked like a Google Doc someone forgot to format. But you know what? People don’t care. They care about outcomes. If your product gets them one step closer to what they want, they’ll forgive typos, mismatched fonts, even a wonky cover.

# The “quiet engine” behind the sales

Now — let me spill the not-so-obvious part. I didn’t just throw the PDF online and hope for the best.

I built tiny distribution loops. Think of them as mini conveyor belts feeding traffic:

* **Reddit threads** where I dropped value bombs, then linked the cheat sheet casually (never spammy).
* **Pinterest pins** — those aesthetic little graphics that send free traffic for months.

None of this is glamorous. But each little breadcrumb stacked up until strangers were buying daily.

# But wait — why $20/day? Isn’t that… small?

Here’s the kicker. People hear “$20/day” and think *pfft, that’s nothing.* But do the math.

$20/day = $600/month.  
$40/day = $1,200/month.  
That’s rent. Or groceries. Or that monthly stress-gnawing bill you’ve been side-eying.

And this is from *one* product. One weekend build. One idea packaged and pushed into the right channels.

Now imagine stacking three of these. Five. Ten. Suddenly you’re looking at $3K–$5K months off products you barely remember making. That’s when the game changes.

# Where people screw this up

Here’s the brutal truth: most folks will never see even $1 from their digital product because they trip on the same banana peels:

* They make something nobody actually needs. (Stop guessing — go lurk in comment sections, forums, DMs. People scream their pain points daily.)
* They overcomplicate. You don’t need a 50-page “ultimate guide.” You need a two-page solution.
* They quit after two posts. Distribution is boring, I get it. But the sales come from tiny, consistent drips.

# My rent, paid by strangers

Every time I think about it, it still feels surreal. My landlord gets paid because random people on the internet keep buying a PDF that solves a problem in 20 minutes or less.

And here’s the part nobody tells you: once you crack the formula for one product, you can repeat it endlessly. Different niches, different pain points, different angles.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a *serving* of tennis drama where the underdog is… well, not really. Roman Safiullin (94th-ranked) is the overwhelming favorite here, and the odds reflect that with the precision of a laser-guided backhand. Let’s break it down:

* **Safiullin’s Implied Probability**: At decimal odds of **1.35 (Fanatics)**, Safiullin’s chances are **74.07%**. That’s like saying your morning coffee will spill if you juggle tennis balls. Not a *when*, a *probably*.
* **Monfils’ Implied Probability**: At **3.25 (Fanatics)**, Gael Monfils (49th-ranked) has a **30.77%** shot. For context, that’s about the same chance I have of explaining why my Netflix password isn’t working.
* **Spread**: Safiullin is -3.5 games on the spread. If you bet on him, you’re basically betting Monfils will serve *10 double faults* and still lose. (Monfils’ 10 double faults in his last match didn’t help, either.)
* **Totals**: Over

At first, it felt simple and innocent. But as time passed, things got complicated.

We once had a video call, but she never wanted to show her face, always saying her hair was messy. Later, she told me she had autism according to her  and our conversations were often one-sided.

We planned to meet at the park but canceled because she said she had hurt her leg. She told me I was treating her differently after she mentioned the autism. She opened up about her past: an ex who abandoned her, another guy who replaced her… I felt bad for her, so I tried to be there.

One day, I got robbed and almost lost her number. She barely reacted  cold, almost indifferent. She even said she wouldn’t text me if I stopped texting her. She’d talk a lot about her cats and her nephews, who also had autism.

There was this time her cousin said she used to drink with her ex  she got extremely angry about it. Later, I invited her to the movies since she once said we never went out. At first, she said she was too shy, but after I insisted, she agreed… only to tell me the next day:
""Maybe we should just be friends?""

Despite that, we still went to the movies, bought candy, kissed during the film, and spent the afternoon acting like a real couple. But she never let me see her phone, avoided giving me her Instagram (she only gave it to me after we broke up), and was always distant.

Another day, we went to the mall  she gave me chocolate, and we ended up at a motel. But the moment we got there, she said she was too shy to turn the lights on. I reassured her, but suddenly her mood flipped completely. She became reactive, distant, almost cold again.

She also didn’t want me meeting her family. Even when I walked her home once, she seemed uncomfortable about it. There was another time her sister dropped her off at my place, and I joked about her being “too picky” about going out. She got furious.

We argued about small things  once, we played a game, and when I criticized it, she got mad and stopped playing altogether. Still, she’d bring me chocolates, we’d spend time together, and then suddenly, she’d talk about breaking up.

She invited me to a party but kept changing her mind: first she wanted me there, then she didn’t, then she did again. I asked if she didn’t want me to go, and she insisted I arrive only after 6 PM. I got there a bit earlier, her sister saw me, and I ended up at a friend’s party with her.

She introduced me as her boyfriend, but out of nowhere, she suddenly joked:
""Let’s download an app to find you a hot girl?""

After that night, she wanted me to sleep over, but I went home. Eventually, I called her and ended things she cried, blocked me, and later accused me of sending her to therapy and “ruining her happiness.” Then, out of nowhere, she texted me saying she missed me more than she expected.

I gave in. We started talking again… until I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she told me to “go find someone else” and claimed she was looking for a friend’s ex there.

I still told her I loved her. She said she went somewhere and wished I was there. Later, she called me inviting me to her mom’s birthday party, but I didn’t go. Her mom even called me asking if I loved her daughter and invited me over for coffee.

We tried talking again, but she said her dad was angry at me. I got upset and vented online, and she found out. That’s when she accused me of using her, of tricking her, and said she only acted this way because she was insecure and autistic. She told me she prayed for me every day… and then she blocked me.

And just like that… she disappeared.

What did I do?


TL;DR: . From the start, We had moments of affection movies, kisses, chocolates, even a motel but she’d switch from loving to cold in seconds. She introduced me as her boyfriend, yet joked about me finding “a hot girl,” invited me to parties but changed her mind, cried when I broke up, blocked me, came back saying she missed me, and then I caught her on a dating app she denied it, told me to “find someone else,” but kept pulling me back. Her mom liked me and even invited me for coffee, but then she said her dad was angry at me, leading to more fights, accusations, and guilt trips. In the end, she said her behavior came from insecurity and autism, claimed she prayed for me daily, blocked me again… and disappeared. I tried, I forgave, I gave everything, but I was left questioning if any of it was real and what I did.",2,1756249799.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Cold foam is the hottest trend among the coffee crowd, and if you’ve had the chance to try it, you’ll know exactly why: cool, fluffy, and rich, adding a layer of cold foam to a glass of cold brew elevates even the most quotidian of caffeine breaks.

Available in our stores exclusively for the autumn season, this convenient Creamer couples the textural excellence of Cold Foam with the sweet and savory notes of Salted Maple to turn any iced coffee into a celebration of fall flavors.

Each canister comes equipped with a nozzle for easy application: just shake the can, remove the cap, and turn the whole can upside down, then gently press the nozzle, as you would a can of whipped cream. In an instant, you’ll have a homemade drink that would make any barista boast. It’s ideal for crafting all kinds of autumnal drinks (have we mentioned it also goes great with Earl Grey or matcha?).

Posting on behalf of my sister (with her okay). She’s 31, Indian, and proudly childfree. Right now, she’s in the US but has some visa uncertainties that may mean going back to India later this year. I wanted to give this a try so she has a chance to find someone genuine — someone who shares her values and isn’t pushing her into traditions she doesn’t want, especially around kids.

About her:

She’s tall (around 5’7”–5’8”), lean and fit (65 kg), with brown skin, black hair, and black eyes. Very active — she dances beautifully, hits the gym, jogs almost every day, and loves staying on the move.

A bit of a tidy soul — she keeps things clean and organized, not obsessively but just naturally neat.

Left-leaning, empathetic, and deeply kind. She feels things very strongly and takes emotions to heart.

Not into dark humor or double-meaning jokes — she prefers sincerity, light humor, and genuine conversations.

Big coffee lover ☕ (non-negotiable in her day), a passionate foodie... not into carbs  (definitely a non-vegetarian, but won’t impose on anyone else), and loves watching K-dramas in her downtime.

Speaks Tamil & Telugu, understands Malayalam, fluent in English (her mother tongue), conversational Hindi, and even a bit of Korean.

She’s an atheist and holds antinatalist views. You don’t have to share them, but respecting and acknowledging her perspective (instead of dismissing or berating it) is important to her.

Very giving in relationships — she’s not picky about height, looks, or boxes to tick. If she loves, she truly understands, supports, and gives space. But it does take her time to form deep connections.

 She is not into online dating , beleives in monogomous relationship. 


What she’s hoping for:

Someone firmly childfree.

Ideally Indian/Indian diaspora, or at least someone who understands.

Kind, respectful, and emotionally intelligent — someone who values freedom and companionship, not control.


If this sounds like it could resonate, feel free to DM me. I’ll help with the initial chats until she’s comfortable.",3,1756249371.0,u_Final_Painter_5216,0,0.8,False
1n10rmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1n10rmx/equipment_advice_3000/,equipment advice [$3000],"My wife bought me a $100 DeLonghi machine for my birthday last year and I quickly went from one Cappuccino every three months to two a day. At some point the $20 grinder died and I bought a J-Ultra which was a major improvement. The problem is that we have 5 coffee drinkers in the house when my daughter is home from college, so I'd like to move on from the manual grinder and upgrade my machine as well in order to speed things up (making a drink for everyone in the morning is almost a 40 minute process). I had my eye on a Zerno Z1 (with HU burrs) and maybe the Fellow Series 1 assuming the reviews are good when it finally ships.

Before I do proceed, I just need a quick sanity check. Everyone in my family drinks milk drinks, and while there's a chance that I get more into straight Espresso, it probably shouldn't be much of a buying consideration. I like the idea of the Fellow because I should be able to switch back and forth between espresso and steam almost instantly. My question is more on the Zerno. Is it massively overkill for my needs? Realistically will I be able to taste the difference between the J-Ultra, a $500 grinder, and the Zerno or is difference only something that I would notice if I'm drinking straight espresso? I like the aesthetics of the Zerno, but I also know myself well enough to know that I'm obsessing about it now, but whatever I pick will probably be fine once I'm not in buying mode.

1n10nxv,https://i.redd.it/dh11iwl72glf1.jpeg,Let’s take a bet - did I ruin 2 piles?,"Moved into a new house about 3 years ago; in past places I’ve done little piles / cold compost, but with more land I’ve wanted to start a hot pile that can chew through things more quickly. After a couple years of settling in, I finally had the chance to put up a couple pallet bays and start the new piles. 

Started about 4 weeks ago with grass clippings and cardboard - with mowing about 2 acres, I get about enough clippings to fill 1/3 of a bay each week. 

After the first 3 weeks of adding things split across 2 bins, I went out to investigate and discovered that the pile was bone dry - I guess that’s not really surprising given the drought conditions we’ve been having up here. The pile was warm-ish, but not *hot* like it should have been; maybe 110* max. Figured out it needed water (based on the sponge rule), so I dragged the hose out to the back of the property - to discover it’s about 15’ too short, and going up the hill leaves not enough water pressure to water the compost that way. So I grabbed a 5 gallon pail and started dumping in water that way. 

After several 15’ trips lugging water, I discovered that compost piles need a lot more water than I thought to get to target moisture - added almost 30 gallons to each side of the bay while mixing and there were still some dry spots. Crazy. 

But the next day? Success! Center of the pile was *hot* to the touch. Things were definitely moving then. Then a day or two later I added in coffee grounds and past date fruit/veggies - not a ton, just what was normally going into the garbage. Checked in yesterday after 2 days and still steam from the pile!

Today I walked back there and was hit by the ammonia smell - not nearly enough browns. Dig to the center of the pile quickly (because I was curious), and realized that one side was hot in the upper third, and the other side was hot in only a small spot at the bottom of the pile. Did some reading, and realized that splitting the pile made them both kind of small for hot composting; they’re about 3’x3’, but only about 2’ tall, which isn’t that much. 

So what to do? Combine them both! Me being me, I decided the best option was to take the pile with more “brush” browns and pile it onto and on the pile with more “cardboard” browns. 

So now we can take bets - did combining the two kill both piles, or make one SUPER pile? It’s now about 4’x4’x4’, which seems like about the right size to really get going. Only time will tell! 

(For legal reasons, this post is mostly in jest; those actions did occur, but it’s nearly impossible to ruin compost, just make it take longer or cold compost). ",7,1756249100.0,composting,8,0.89,False
