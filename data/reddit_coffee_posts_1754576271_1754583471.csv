1mk4fm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobs/comments/1mk4fm2/heres_how_i_found_success_finding_a_remote_jobs/,Heres how I found success finding a remote jobs,"In 2023 I graduated with a computer science degree and I couldn't even land an interview. I applied for months, tailored my resume, did coffee chats, got referrals, and nothing seemed to worked. Until eventually, after 450 applications, and 6 months of applying, I got a single interview, which luckily converted into an offer. The secret? Nothing.

I just kept applying, and eventually it worked out. The only thing that may have changed throughout the months of applying was my volume. Things got more serious towards the end, stress from parents, and the thought of getting a job out of field or taking loans to pursue a masters were all the motivation I needed.

After looking back on my own search and trading stories with dozens of other recent grads, a few themes keep coming up:

* Take the time in the beginning to polish your resume, you shouldn't have to keep re-visiting it. Do it once, and forget it.
* Apply at the source. Use the company's career page or the ats platform they are on. A lot of LinkedIn/Indeed jobs are imported from external sources, remove the extra layer between you and the hiring manager.
* Move fast, you should be submitting your application the first day the job is posted, ideally the first couple of hours. This lets you land towards the top of the stack before the post gets flooded. The first couple of hours is also when the hiring managers are closely monitoring the first wave of applications (that's how it's worked at the last 2 companies I've been at).
* Weekly/monthly bursts of applications means a lot less than consistent daily applications. That's because in those burst sessions, you may apply to more jobs but you're applying to more jobs posted days if not weeks ago. I really do think speed means a lot in the job search.
* If you're in a competitive field (software engineering) and arguably anything remote, be aggressive with volume, it's not necessarily about how many jobs you apply to over the course of months, it's about how many jobs you apply to where you expect to be competitive. Apply early, and have a relevant background for the role.

Again, these are all opinions. Nothing is proven, but I see these pop up anecdotally all the time. Right after I started my first job, I started a project called AutoSWE to try to solve a lot of the common issues with the job search. It was also a way to keep coding on the side. Since then, it’s evolved into [Maestra](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/maestra-accelerate-your-j/chjedhomjmkfdlgdnedjdcglbakjemlm?utm_source=reddit_organic&utm_medium=remotejobs&utm_campaign=success_finding_remote_jobs), my side project that I still work on for fun.

# How to boost TV Antenna Signal Homemade: Expert Guide 2025

Television, despite the plethora of streaming services available, retains a significant foothold in households across the globe, particularly for free access to local news, weather updates, and live events. A strong, clear signal is paramount to enjoying over-the-air (OTA) broadcasts.However, obstacles like distance from the broadcast tower, environmental interference, and even the construction materials of your home can weaken the signal. While professional installation and amplifiers are options, many turn to homemade solutions.This guide, updated for 2025, explores proven and effective DIY methods to boost your TV antenna signal.

**Understanding Signal Strength: The Foundation of a Stronger Connection**

Before diving into the practicalities of boosting your antenna signal,it's crucial to understand what constitutes a strong signal and the factors that impact it. Signal strength isn't just about having a clear picture; it affects the ability to receive all available channels, minimizes pixelation or freezing, and ensures a stable viewing experience.

Signal strength is often measured as a numerical value on your TV or converter box, typically ranging from 0 to 100. A score of 70 or higher generally indicates a strong signal, while anything below 40 suggests unreliable reception.Distance from broadcast towers is the most significant factor. OTA signals weaken as they travel thru the air, encountering obstacles like trees, buildings, and terrain. These obstacles cause signal attenuation, reducing the power available to the antenna.Electromagnetic interference (EMI) from other electronic devices can also disrupt TV signals. Wireless routers, microwaves, and even fluorescent lights can introduce noise into the signal path. The type of antenna used plays a role too. Different antennas are designed to receive specific frequencies or signal types. the antenna's position and orientation are critical.A poorly positioned antenna may struggle to capture the available signal effectively.

**Optimizing Antenna Placement: Location,Location,Location**

One of the most effective,and frequently enough overlooked,ways to boost your antenna signal is simply finding the optimal location. this means experimenting with different positions, both inside and outside your home, to identify where the signal is strongest.

Begin by consulting a broadcast tower locator tool.Websites and apps can pinpoint the location of nearby TV transmission towers,allowing you to direct your antenna towards them. Generally, the higher your antenna is located, the better the signal reception. Obstacles like trees, buildings, and hills can block or weaken signals. If possible, mount your antenna on the roof or in an attic space.Consider the direction of the broadcast towers. use a compass to identify the azimuth (direction) of the signal, and align your antenna accordingly. Small adjustments in antenna orientation can have a significant impact. Reposition the antenna slightly and rescan for channels to determine if the signal strength improves. Consider using a signal meter. Affordable signal meters can provide real-time feedback on signal strength, making it easier to pinpoint the optimal antenna location and orientation.

**DIY Antenna Enhancements: Simple Projects for Signal Amplification**

While commercially available amplifiers can be effective, several homemade solutions can provide a noticeable boost to your antenna signal. These enhancements are typically inexpensive and require basic tools and materials.

A basic DIY antenna booster can be constructed using aluminum foil, cardboard, and basic wiring. Wrap a large piece of cardboard in aluminum foil, creating a reflective surface. Attach this reflector behind your existing antenna,oriented towards the broadcast towers. The foil acts as a parabolic reflector, focusing the incoming signals onto the antenna.Secure the reflector to the antenna mast or mount, ensuring it remains securely in place.

Another approach involves constructing a simple “cantenna,” using a cylindrical metal container (like a coffee can). Cut a small hole in the side of the can and insert a coaxial cable connector. Position the can so that the antenna element is inside the can. The can acts as a waveguide, focusing the signal onto the antenna element. Experiment with the size and shape of the can to optimize performance.

you can create a dipole antenna using two equal lengths of wire. Strip the ends of the wires and attach them to the terminals of a balun (balanced-to-unbalanced transformer). The balun converts the balanced signal from the dipole to the unbalanced signal required by most TVs. Position the dipole antenna horizontally, with the wires extending outwards. Adjust the length of the wires and the orientation of the antenna to optimize signal strength.**Minimizing Interference: Shielding and Isolation Techniques**

Electromagnetic interference (EMI) can severely degrade your antenna signal. Identifying and mitigating sources of interference is crucial for achieving a clear and stable picture.Identify potential sources of interference in your home. common culprits include wireless routers,microwave ovens,computers,and fluorescent lights. Test by turning off suspected devices one by one to see if the antenna signal improves. Shield your antenna cable with a ferrite choke. Ferrite chokes suppress high-frequency noise present on the cable, reducing interference. Wrap the antenna cable around the choke several times near the antenna and the TV.

Relocate interfering devices away from your antenna and TV. Maintain a distance of at least a few feet between these devices and your antenna cable. Use shielded cables for all connections. Shielded coaxial cables reduce the likelihood of external interference entering the signal path. Consider using a power line filter to reduce noise on your electrical system. Power line filters can help to clean up the electricity supply, reducing interference from electrical devices.

**Grounding and Surge Protection: Ensuring Safety and Signal Integrity**

Proper grounding is essential for both safety and signal integrity. A properly grounded antenna system can definitely help to protect your equipment from lightning strikes and reduce noise.

Ensure your antenna mast is properly grounded.Connect a heavy-gauge copper wire from the antenna mast to a grounding rod driven into the earth. This provides a path for electrical surges to safely dissipate into the ground. Use a surge protector on your coaxial cable. Surge protectors can prevent damage to your TV and other equipment in the event of a lightning strike.

Inspect your grounding system regularly to ensure it is indeed in good condition. Check for loose connections or corrosion on the grounding wire and grounding rod. Ground loops can introduce noise into your antenna system. Ensure that all components of your system are grounded to a single point to avoid ground loops.

**Choosing the right Cable: The Backbone of Signal Transmission**

The type and quality of coaxial cable used to connect your antenna to your TV can substantially impact signal strength. Low-quality or damaged cables can attenuate the signal, leading to a weak or unreliable picture.

Use high-quality, shielded coaxial cable (RG6). RG6 cable has better shielding and lower signal loss compared to older RG59 cable. Ensure that the connectors are properly installed and tightened. Loose or corroded connectors can introduce signal loss. Avoid using excessively long lengths of coaxial cable. Longer cables introduce more signal loss. If you need to run a long cable, consider using an amplifier to compensate for the loss.

Inspect your coaxial cable regularly for damage. Look for kinks, cuts, or corrosion. Replace any damaged cables immediately. Consider using a cable tester to check for signal loss and impedance mismatches. A cable tester can definitely help to identify problems with your coaxial cable.

**Fine-Tuning Reception: Maximizing Signal-to-Noise Ratio**

Even with a well-positioned antenna and quality cables, fine-tuning your reception can further improve signal quality. This involves making small adjustments to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Rescan for channels periodically. Over time, changes in weather conditions or construction in your area can affect signal propagation. Rescanning ensures that your TV is tuned to the strongest available signals. Experiment with different antenna orientations.Even small changes in antenna orientation can significantly impact signal strength. Use a signal meter to monitor signal strength as you make adjustments.

Adjust your TV's picture settings. Optimizing the brightness, contrast, and sharpness settings can improve picture clarity. Consider using a preamplifier. Preamplifiers boost the signal at the antenna, improving the signal-to-noise ratio.

**Dealing with Multipath Interference: Combating Signal Reflections**

Multipath interference occurs when TV signals reflect off buildings, trees, or other objects, creating multiple versions of the same signal that arrive at your antenna at slightly different times. This can cause ghosting or distorted images.

Use a directional antenna. Directional antennas are more sensitive to signals coming from a specific direction,reducing the impact of multipath interference. Position your antenna to avoid direct reflections.If possible, locate your antenna in a position where it has a clear line of sight to the broadcast towers.

Use a signal combiner. Signal combiners can definitely help to combine multiple antenna signals, reducing the effects of multipath interference. Experiment with different antenna positions and orientations to minimize multipath interference. Minor changes can make a difference.**Advanced Techniques: Exploring Less Common Solutions**

Beyond the standard methods, several less common techniques can be employed to further boost antenna signal, though they may require more technical expertise.

Consider using phased array antennas. Phased array antennas use multiple antenna elements to steer the signal beam, improving signal gain and reducing interference. Experiment with different antenna polarizations. TV signals can be transmitted in either horizontal or vertical polarization. Try rotating your antenna to match the polarization of the broadcast signals.

Use a software-defined radio (SDR) for signal analysis. SDRs can be used to analyze the characteristics of the received signals, providing valuable data for optimizing antenna performance. Construct a helical antenna. Helical antennas are directional antennas that can provide high gain, but they can be more challenging to build.

By understanding the principles of signal propagation and employing these DIY techniques, you can significantly improve your TV antenna signal and enjoy free, over-the-air broadcasts with a clear and stable picture. Remember to experiment and be patient; finding the optimal solution often requires a process of trial and error.

I see it differently. If I could put my thoughts in one place, it would be a wooden shack in the woods. Inside, there are many, many gnomes: persistent, busy, evolving, and all of them want the same Snow White from another kingdom, who lives in a castle and looks like the ideal of nature. 

 It sounds scary, but it got me thinking: how do our words affect others? 

Every thinking person has thought about it. We are always thinking. As a person who is always subject to doubt, I cannot imagine a moment of complete peace and quiet. Drinking coffee in the morning, going to pick up a parcel, running in the park or lying in bed before going to bed are thoughts. Images, ideas, flows. They slip away, come back and do unimaginable things to you, people are literally subject to change through words. We can be reshaped just by opening our mouths. So what kinds of influences are there? 

 If you look at it from a negative perspective, the first thing that comes to mind is the art of manipulation. What kind of genius came up with this idea? And why is such a disgusting concept associated with art? There are so many books on this topic that you can just pick them up in stacks and become a master of words, just so you don't lose control of the situation. It's like wearing invisible armor, carrying a bunch of shields, and wrapping yourself in chainmail from head to toe, confidently stepping onto the battlefield. And my knees are trembling. And my palms are sweating. 

 The feeling of control is actually a dangerous thing, it's too illusory and naive - it will always deceive. Strictly speaking, we will all knowingly subject each other to humiliation, and we ourselves will be humiliated until we understand that manipulation is complete nonsense.

 So, we've analyzed one side, but what about the other side? It's not always black and white, so let's explore the white side as well.

For example, you're walking down the street, thinking about something, and you accidentally overhear someone else's conversation. It's like being scalded with boiling water. You stop in the middle of the road, completely taken aback. Your worries disappear, your thoughts fall into place, and you feel a sense of relief. You no longer need to doubt, as a long-awaited brick of understanding has fallen from the sky. 
In this way, we can help each other through our words without even realizing it. Perhaps you've saved someone simply by existing in the right place at the right time. The world is changing. He does somersaults in the midst of the darkness of everyday life and doesn't ask: ""Is that appropriate now?"" 

Words are needed. They provide air, food. 
They're everywhere. Different formulations, different angles of vision. We are all different.
Life does not throw us into the open sea. She carefully waits for the moment - a moment of trust and acceptance. She's already planted a seed in us. And someday it will sprout. 
Everyone has that tree, you just have to wait for it.

 So, let's get back to the main issue I wanted to address. How can we tell the difference between our own words and the billions of other people's souls?  
 This question leads to even more similar ones, but we'll save them for later. Suffice it to say that the thoughts of our parents, friends, partners, teachers, acquaintances, and internet experts create an alliance in our minds. It becomes increasingly challenging to distinguish between our own and their opinions. Although maybe they don't need to be filtered at all, just accepted as a fact. 

 We are a collection of stories and quotes that connect all of humanity with an invisible thread. It turns out that we are not so alone.
But even now, the question does not disappear, it flares up with renewed vigor. At this moment, are these my thoughts or ours? 

 Yes, of course, it is all very intriguing, and perhaps someone already knows the answer, has come to a solution and become a genius. 
But I will never accept it. 
I am not in this world for accuracy. 
I am for doubt.

Многие сравнивают наш мозг со сборником рассказов или цитат. Я вижу это иначе. Если бы можно было поселить мои мысли в одном месте, эта была бы деревянная лачуга в лесу. А внутри нее много-много гномиков: настырных, мельтешащих, развивающихся, и все хотят ту самую Белоснежку из другого королевства, которая живет в замке и выглядит как идеал природы. 

Звучит пугающе, но это натолкнуло меня на мысль: а как наши слова влияют на других? 

Каждый мыслящий человек раздумывал об этом. Мы всегда думаем. Я, как личность вечно подверженная сомнениям, не могу вообразить момент полного спокойствия и тишины. Пьешь кофе утром, идешь за посылкой, бегаешь по парку или лежишь в кровати перед сном - мысли. Образы, идеи, потоки. Они ускользают, возвращаются и делают с тобой невообразимые вещи, люди в буквальном смысле подверженны изменениям через слова. Нас могут перекраивать, просто открыв рот. Так какие же виды влияния существуют? 

Если смотреть с отрицательной стороны, то в голову сразу придет искусство манипулирования. Что за гений придумал это? И почему такую гадкую вещь связали с искусством? Столько книг развелось на эту тему, просто стопками бери и станешь мастером слова, лишь бы не растерять контроль над ситуацией. Будто нацепили на себя невидимые доспехи, набрали себе уйму щитов, да в придачу обмотались кольчугой от макушки до пяток и идут такие самоуверенные на поле битвы. А коленки-то дрожат. Да и ладошки вспотели. 

Чувство контроля на самом деле опасная штука, оно слишком призрачное и наивное - всегда обманет. Строго говоря мы все будем заведомо подвергать друг друга унижениям, да и сами будем унижены, пока не поймем, что манипуляции полный бред.

Итак, с одной стороны разобрали, а что там на другом берегу? Не всегда же бывает только черное, посмотрим и на белое.

Вот, например, идешь по улице, размышляешь и случайно услышал чужой диалог. И тебя как кипятком ошпарило. Стоишь, как вкопанный посреди дороги. Волнение пропало, мысли встали на свои места и так хорошо на душе. Больше не нужно сомневаться, ведь на тебя с неба упал долгожданный кирпич осознания. 
Таким образом мы можем помогать друг другу за счет слов и даже не знать об этом. Вдруг ты спас кого-то просто своим существованием в нужном месте и в нужное время? Мир меняется. Он делает сальто посреди мрака обыденности и не спрашивает: «А это уместно сейчас?». 

Слова нужны. Они дают воздух, пищу. 
Они повсюду. Разные формулировки, разные углы видения. Мы все разные.
Жизнь не бросает нас в открытое море. Она бережно ждет момента - минуты доверия и принятия. Она уже посадила в нас зернышко. И когда-нибудь оно прорастет. 
У каждого есть то самое деревце, его просто нужно дождаться.

Итак, вернемся к основной проблеме, что я хотела разобрать. Как понять, где наши слова, а где еще миллиард частичек чужих душ?  
Из этого вопроса у меня, конечно, вытекает еще больше подобных ему, но оставим их на потом. Скажу только, что мысли родителей, друзей, партнеров, преподавателей, знакомых, знатоков из интернет создают альянс в нашей голове. И уже становится крайне сложно разделить свое и чужое. Хотя может их и не нужно вовсе фильтровать, просто принять, как факт. 

Мы - сборник рассказов и цитат, что связывает все человечество невидимой нитью. Получается, мы не так уж и одиноки.
Но даже сейчас вопрос не исчезает, он вспыхивает с новой силой. В эту секунду это мои мысли или наши? 

Да, конечно это все очень интригующе, да и возможно кто-то уже знает ответ, пришел к решению и стал гением. 
Но я никогда его не приму. 
Я в этом мире не для точности. 
Я для сомнений.

1mk4b4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mk4b4l/uncover_if_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_by/,Uncover If the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker by BUNN Lives Up to the Hype,"The BUNN 42900.0501 has been part of my daily coffee routine for over two months, and there’s a lot to unpack about this versatile single-serve brewer. I’m someone who takes their morning cup of coffee (and sometimes tea) very seriously, and this machine has certainly added a layer of simplicity and customization to my brewing experience. That being said, it’s not perfect, and I’ll dive into both the highlights and areas where it falls short.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing you’ll notice about this single-serve brewer is its sleek and modern design. The black and stainless steel finish blends seamlessly into most kitchen aesthetics, including my rather minimalist countertop. Measuring 10.1 inches in depth, 7.2 inches in width, and 12.1 inches in height, it doesn’t hog counter space, which is a lifesaver in my tiny apartment kitchen. The build feels sturdy, and weighing just under 12 pounds, it’s easy enough to move around if necessary. However, it is a bit bulkier than some other single-serve brewers I’ve seen, which could be a dealbreaker for those with extremely limited space.

**Simple Brewing Options**

One of the most impressive features is its multi-use capabilities. Whether you’re in the mood for single-pack coffee pods, ground coffee, tea bags, or loose tea, the brewer has you covered. It even dispenses hot water, which I’ve used for instant soups and oatmeal on particularly lazy evenings. The drawers for the different configurations—K-Cups, loose grounds, tea bags, and hot water—are straightforward to swap in and out, though I did find myself double-checking the manual the first few times to make sure I was using the correct one.  

If you're debating whether it might be right for your kitchen or lifestyle, you can [Check BUNN 42900.0501 price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b08v96t69c/)

**Ease of Use and Special Features**

The machine is manual yet easy to operate, with its button interface that even my notoriously tech-challenged friend figured out in one go. The pulse brew setting is a game-changer for anyone who likes their coffee on the stronger side. I used this feature on high-altitude roast coffee grounds and was genuinely impressed by how bold and rich the flavor turned out. The water level indicator in the pour-in bowl is a thoughtful addition, but the markings can get hard to read when you're in a dimly lit kitchen early in the morning. 

The BUNN brews swiftly, thanks to its internal stainless-steel tank that keeps water at an optimum temperature for flavor extraction. It takes under a minute to deliver a cup of coffee, which is perfect for my hectic mornings when I’m scrambling to get out the door. However, I noticed that the machine can get noisy during operation. It’s not deafening, but the brewing noise might be irritating for light sleepers.

**Good Aspects**

- Multi-functionality: compatible with K-Cups, ground coffee, tea bags, loose tea, and hot water dispensing.  
- Quick brewing time (under a minute).  
- Pulse brew technology allows control over coffee strength.  
- Includes multiple drawers for different brewing configurations.
- Water temperature is kept optimal for flavor extraction.  

**Pitfalls**

- On the noisier side while brewing.  
- Drawer swapping can seem fiddly at first.  
- Bulky compared to other single-serve brewers.  
- Pour-in bowl's water level markings are hard to see under poor lighting.

**Product Competitors**

In comparison to brands like Keurig and Nespresso, this coffee maker stands out for its versatility. The ability to use a variety of coffee brewing methods is something neither of those competitors can match at this price range. However, while it offers a broader scope of brewing options, Keurig machines are quieter and often come with more digital features like timers or smartphone compatibility. Nespresso, on the other hand, excels in delivering consistently creamy espresso, whereas the BUNN’s strength lies in its adaptability for coffee and tea drinkers alike. One drawback I’ve noticed compared to its competitors is a lack of a built-in milk frother, which might be a dealbreaker for cappuccino or latte enthusiasts. 

**Smart Spending**

While the initial price tag might be slightly steep for a single-serve coffee maker, considering the features baked into this unit, it’s a worthwhile splurge if you often switch between tea, coffee, or hot water needs. It’s a versatile product that cuts down on the need for multiple machines, saving both space and money in the long run. That said, if you’re someone who strictly drinks espresso or only uses K-Cups, this might be more machine than you really need.

The sheer volume of content is almost intimidating, but the streams themselves are steady—no panic during Premier League matches, which is more than I can say for a few others. Customer service is quick (I got an answer about EPG setup at 11pm), and the interface is clean. Downsides? A couple of the more obscure international channels drop out now and then, but I haven’t found anyone better at this price.

# 2. [Z2UIPTV](https://z2uiptv.com/)

**Price:** $18/month  
**Channels:** 35,000+ live, 150,000+ VOD  
**Smoothness:** 8/10  
**Devices:** Android, Smart TVs, web player

PixelStream felt a bit pricier, but they do deliver on quality. Streams are crisp and I rarely hit buffering, even during peak hours. Their movie library is strong, though they lag behind MEZZY on series updates. I appreciate the focus on North American and UK channels, but found the Asian lineup a bit lackluster.

# 3. [Aurorafast](http://Aurorafast.com)

**Price:** $14/month  
**Channels:** 38,000+ live, 120,000+ VOD  
**Smoothness:** 8.5/10  
**Devices:** Firestick, Mag boxes, TiviMate

Aurorafast is my “sleeper pick.” Not as flashy on paper, but it’s surprisingly reliable for sports streams, especially European football and F1. Their catch-up feature is hit-or-miss, but for the price, it’s hard to argue. I did run into occasional slow VOD loads on weekends, though.

# 4. [NovaFlare IPTV](http://NovaFlareIPTV.com)

**Price:** $15/month  
**Channels:** 32,000+ live, 110,000+ VOD  
**Smoothness:** 8/10  
**Devices:** Android, web, Firestick

NovaFlare has a bit of a retro interface, but it grew on me. Their customer service is super friendly (maybe a bit too chatty, honestly). Channel variety is solid, especially in the US and South America. Some of their 4K streams felt a little compressed compared to others, but it’s not a dealbreaker.

# 5. [StreamBlazeTV](https://iptvmeezzy.blogspot.com/2025/08/unlock-world-of-entertainment-with-iptv.html)

**Price:** $17/month  
**Channels:** 36,000+ live, 140,000+ VOD  
**Smoothness:** 9/10  
**Devices:** All the basics, including older smart TVs

StreamBlaze is probably the most “plug and play” of the bunch. Setup took me all of five minutes and I was watching old sitcoms before my coffee got cold. Their VOD gets updated constantly, but they lack some niche European news channels I like.

# 6. [VisionCastPro](https://iptvmeezzy.blogspot.com/2025/05/the-benefits-of-watching-latest-tv.html)

**Price:** $13/month  
**Channels:** 28,000+ live, 75,000+ VOD  
**Smoothness:** 7/10 (occasional buffering on weekends)  
**Devices:** Android, web

VisionCastPro is the budget pick here. If you’re not super picky about having every channel in the world, it’s a good deal. Their VOD isn’t as deep, but honestly, I found a bunch of random old movies I’d totally forgotten about. Streams are mostly smooth, but I did hit a couple of rough patches during big events.

# 7. [IPsharkTV](https://iptvmeezzy.blogspot.com/2025/04/the-benefits-of-watching-sports-with.html)

**Price:** $15/month  
**Channels:** 33,000+ live, 90,000+ VOD  
**Smoothness:** 7.5/10  
**Devices:** Android, Firestick, browser

[Z2UIPTV](https://z2uiptv.com/) is straightforward and beginner-friendly. Their setup instructions are clear, and the interface is simple—maybe a little too basic for some, but it’s hard to get lost. Their lineup is decent, though I had a few audio sync issues on certain channels. Support was responsive when I flagged it, but fixes took a couple of days.

# My Takeaway (and a caffeine crash)

If you’re after the biggest channel count and rock-solid streams, MEZZY ended up being my winner by a nose—especially for the price. But honestly, each of these has its own strengths. If you want something simple and cheap, VisionCastPro will do the trick. Need tons of sports? Aurorafast or StreamBlazeTV are worth a go. PixelStream Vault is great for movie buffs, especially if you can stretch the budget a little.

After his first colonoscopy the doctor got on him about fiber, and honestly I need to be better about it too, so I got Benefiber for both of us and we both started using it. Since I have IBS-M I was doing this unhinged thing of mixing some benefiber and miralax together in my coffee. I was like why not, I've tried everything else. It actually worked really, really well. My digestion got way more normal and it seemed great.

Well, since Benefiber is fairly expensive and we're both using it daily, I decided to get this giant jar of the Costco brand. Immediately I started getting diarrhea so, in my infinite wisdom, I cut out the Miralax and went to 2x a day benefiber. After that it got REALLY bad and I was like, ok, it's probably the stupid ""Benefiber""

But I'm looking at Costco and looking at Walmart and like... they have the same ingredients?? I'm so confused.

## Key Features Analysis

Mylar stand up pouches boast a range of features that contribute to their effectiveness as packaging solutions. understanding these features is essential for selecting the right pouch for your specific needs.

**Material Composition:** The primary component of mylar stand up pouches is polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film, commonly known as mylar. This material provides excellent barrier properties against moisture, oxygen, and light. The pouches often consist of multiple layers, including an inner layer of polyethylene (PE) for heat sealing and an aluminum foil layer for enhanced barrier protection. The thickness of each layer can be customized to meet specific product requirements, ranging from 2.5 mil to 7 mil for varying levels of protection.

The choice of adhesive used to laminate these layers together is also critical. Food-grade adhesives are essential for food packaging applications, ensuring no harmful chemicals leach into the contents.The quality of the mylar film itself also impacts the pouch's performance, with higher-quality films offering better puncture resistance and durability.

**Closure Mechanism:** The closure mechanism of a mylar stand up pouch is vital for maintaining product freshness and preventing spoilage. Common closure options include zip closures, heat seals, and spouts. Zip closures offer convenience for resealing and are ideal for products that are consumed over time. Heat seals provide a tamper-evident closure and are suitable for single-use products.

Spouts are commonly used for liquid or powdered products, allowing for easy dispensing. The quality of the zip closure or heat seal determines the pouch's ability to create an airtight seal. Strong,reliable closures are essential for preventing oxygen and moisture from entering the pouch,thus extending the product's shelf life. Some pouches also feature tear notches for easy opening, enhancing user convenience.

**Stand-Up Design:** The stand-up design of these pouches is a important advantage, enabling them to stand upright on shelves and display surfaces. This improves product visibility and allows for efficient use of space. The gusset, or the bottom fold of the pouch, provides stability and allows the pouch to expand to accommodate larger volumes.

The width and depth of the gusset influence the overall stability of the pouch and its ability to maintain its shape when filled. Pouches with wider gussets are generally more stable and can hold heavier contents without tipping over. The stand-up design also facilitates branding and labeling, with ample surface area for graphics and product information.**Printing and labeling:** Mylar stand up pouches offer excellent opportunities for branding and product labeling. High-quality printing techniques, such as rotogravure and digital printing, allow for vibrant and detailed graphics. This enables brands to create visually appealing packaging that attracts consumers' attention.

The surface of the mylar film is receptive to various printing inks, ensuring that the designs remain crisp and durable.Labels can be directly printed onto the pouch or applied as separate stickers. The choice of printing method depends on the complexity of the design and the quantity of pouches being produced. Foil stamping and embossing are also options for adding a premium look and feel to the packaging.

## Core Benefits

Mylar stand up pouches offer a multitude of benefits that make them a superior packaging option for a variety of products. These benefits directly impact product quality, shelf life, and consumer satisfaction.

**Extended Shelf Life:** The extraordinary barrier properties of mylar film protect products from oxygen,moisture,and light,significantly extending their shelf life. this is especially crucial for food items, preventing spoilage and maintaining freshness. The airtight seal created by the closure mechanism further enhances the pouch's ability to preserve product quality.

For oxygen-sensitive products like coffee or dried fruits, mylar pouches with an aluminum foil layer provide an even greater level of protection. By minimizing exposure to environmental factors, mylar stand up pouches help businesses reduce waste and ensure that their products reach consumers in optimal condition. This leads to increased customer satisfaction and brand loyalty.

**Enhanced Product Protection:** Mylar pouches offer robust protection against physical damage, such as punctures and tears.The durable material withstands the rigors of shipping and handling, preventing product loss and contamination. This is especially crucial for fragile or valuable items. The multi-layer construction of the pouches adds an extra layer of security, making them suitable for a wide range of products with varying protection needs.

Whether it's protecting delicate electronic components from static discharge or preventing moisture damage to sensitive powders, mylar stand up pouches provide peace of mind to both manufacturers and consumers. The ability to customize the pouch's thickness and material composition allows for tailored protection based on specific product requirements.

**Improved Brand Visibility:** The stand-up design and ample surface area of mylar pouches offer excellent opportunities for branding and marketing. Vibrant graphics and eye-catching designs can attract consumers' attention on store shelves, increasing product visibility and sales. The pouches can be custom-printed with brand logos, product information, and promotional messages.

This makes them an effective tool for building brand recognition and communicating product benefits. The stand-up format also allows for strategic placement of product information, ensuring that key selling points are easily visible to shoppers. By investing in high-quality printing and design, businesses can leverage mylar stand up pouches to create a strong brand identity and differentiate their products from the competition.**Convenient Storage and Usage:** Mylar stand up pouches are lightweight and easy to store, taking up minimal space in warehouses, retail environments, and consumers' homes. The resealable closure options, such as zip closures, allow for convenient usage and prevent product spills. The tear notches facilitate easy opening, enhancing the overall consumer experience.

The pouches are also easy to transport and handle, making them a practical choice for both manufacturers and consumers. The adaptability of the pouches allows them to conform to different shapes and sizes, optimizing storage space and reducing shipping costs.

## FAQs Section

**Are Mylar Stand Up Pouches Recyclable?**
The recyclability of mylar stand up pouches depends on their composition and local recycling infrastructure. Some pouches are made from recyclable materials like polyethylene (PE), while others contain mixed materials that are more tough to recycle. It's essential to check the product label or contact the manufacturer to determine the recyclability of a specific pouch.

Moreover, some municipalities may not have the facilities to recycle multi-layer packaging materials, even if they contain recyclable components. Consumers should check with their local recycling programs to determine if mylar stand up pouches are accepted. Opting for mono-material pouches,when available,can improve recyclability.

**Can Mylar Stand Up Pouches Be Used For Hot Filling?**
Yes, some mylar stand up pouches are specifically designed for hot filling applications. These pouches are made from heat-resistant materials that can withstand high temperatures without compromising their integrity or barrier properties. Though, it's crucial to verify that the pouch is explicitly labeled as suitable for hot filling before using it for this purpose.

The maximum temperature and filling process may vary depending on the pouch's design and material composition. Consulting with the manufacturer is recommended to ensure that the selected pouch is appropriate for the intended hot filling application. Using the wrong type of pouch for hot filling can result in leakage, seal failure, or product contamination.

**Are Mylar Stand Up Pouches Food Grade?**
Yes,mylar stand up pouches used for food packaging must be food grade,meaning they are made from materials that are safe for contact with food. Food-grade pouches comply with regulations set by organizations like the FDA, ensuring that they do not contain harmful chemicals that could leach into the food.

It's essential to purchase mylar pouches from reputable suppliers who can provide certifications of compliance. Non-food-grade pouches may contain substances that can contaminate food and pose health risks. Look for pouches that are labeled as ""food grade"" and made from materials like polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) that are approved for food contact.

1mk3xbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThirtiesIndia/comments/1mk3xbg/whats_the_most_materialistic_thing_you_own/,What’s the most materialistic thing you own?,"One of my friends asked me this question a few days back. 

And the instant answer I gave him was weird. I said, “I want to have a nice home one day”.

He then explained to me, in some condescending tone, “I asked the most materialistic thing you *own*, not dream.”

I thought for a few seconds. And said, “It’s my laptop”.

The one I bought for around 60k two years back. The one I’m writing this on. And also the one which keeps on hanging every few days (The free anti-virus thing stopped after its one year period. And I never had, nor will have, any plans of renewing it.  Since last one year, I am running mostly on hope. I keep pressing ctrl + S every few seconds despite the AutoSave on. You never know).

My friend seemed a little puzzled hearing my answer. I don’t think a laptop is what he had imagined hearing. Should have told him about my beautiful, yellow, invisible Lambo. That would have shown him his place.

My laptop is indeed the most materialistic thing I own. But only in terms of value. If you count for other important things, for example stupidity, I have far more valuable possessions. I once bought a cheap, third-grade, duplicate Martin Ødegaard Arsenal shirt. Thinking it’ll look nice and same as the original one. But it turned out the fakest shirt someone could wear. Would have used it to mop the floor if it didn’t have Arsenal's crest on it.

Or the time a friend gifted me a 5.5k watch on my birthday. I kept it nicely on a shelf for six months. Who would want to wear an expensive watch. And that too a new one. 

The worst part is I then had to gift him a 5.5k watch on his birthday too (A ~~Lannister~~ moron always pays his debts).

It’s not that I’m not materialistic, it’s that the things I want to buy (the original stuff), is so far off the chart financially that I may need to work for at least ten more years to even dream of owning them. Till then, I should probably just save, invest, eat kurkure and drink coke for dinner most nights, and pray, and maybe stop spending on things I don’t really need. 

Or worse, I’ll have to find a way to start a business, and start selling something people don’t need, nor will ever need. And make millions. And travel the world. And sit in the sun at 9 in the morning in my 200 acre wide farmhouse, and silently sip my coffee.

I hope this was materialistic enough for my friend.

But this also got me thinking, is there something I want to buy right now? Something which can possibly dethrone my laptop as the most materialistic item I own?

Can't think of anything. But maybe.

My watch is no longer on the shelf. I wear it now.

Quite regularly.

And I am soon getting my hands on a Martin Ødegaard Arsenal shirt too.

Hopefully, the original one.",1,1754582298.0,ThirtiesIndia,1,1.0,False

1mk3wn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1mk3wn0/the_first_cut_was_his/,The First Cut Was His,"Chapter 1

The key paused just outside the lock, trembling between my fingers. My knuckles were pale from the pressure, and beneath my scrubs, sweat clung to my spine.

Ten hours in the ER had left me hollowed out—another endless stream of traumas, code blues, and unspoken grief. My shoulders ached from tension I hadn’t noticed until I tried to exhale.

All I wanted was a hot shower, a glass of wine, and the quiet comfort of Alexander’s arms. That thought—the image of his arms around me—had been the only thing keeping me upright during the final hour of my shift.

The deadbolt gave way with a soft click. I stepped inside.

The house was quiet. Too quiet.

Alexander’s briefcase sat near the door, a corner of his monogrammed handkerchief peeking out. His keys were tossed haphazardly beside the ceramic bowl where I always placed mine. But what stopped me cold was the unfamiliar flash of crimson next to them. A handbag. Red Hermès. Victoria’s.

My stomach gave a slow turn.

She must have dropped by unannounced. Maybe to go over the final seating chart for the foundation gala next month. She often came by when Alexander and I were both home—never when I was alone. Still, something felt off. My shoes came off with a quiet sigh as I padded across the marble floor, each step slow and uncertain.

Then I heard it.

A woman’s laugh.

Muffled. Breathless. Intimate.

I froze. My pulse thudded against my eardrums as I strained to listen.

A man's voice followed—deep, smooth, and low with something that sounded like pleasure. Alexander’s voice. But not the tone he used with me. This one was softer. Almost reverent.

I moved toward the source of the sound—the study. The door was slightly ajar, a thin edge of light spilling into the hallway like a blade.

“They’re probably just talking,” I whispered to myself. “Just... planning.”

But my hand was already rising, fingers brushing the door. Some part of me—a desperate, clinging part—still hoped I was wrong.

I pushed it open.

The scent struck me first—something floral and sweet, too strong for a room that should’ve smelled like old books and leather. The overhead lamp cast a golden pool of light across the desk, illuminating a scene so vivid it stole the air from my lungs.

Victoria was perched on the edge of Alexander’s desk, her silk blouse unbuttoned to the navel, skirt bunched around her hips. Her legs were wrapped around my husband’s waist. His hands gripped the backs of her thighs, anchoring her to him. His dress shirt was open, his pants halfway down, exposing skin I knew too well.

They didn’t flinch. They didn’t scramble apart. They just turned—together—as though I were an interruption to a business meeting.

“Elena.” Alexander’s voice was calm. Measured. The same voice he used at campaign fundraisers. “You’re home early.”

The walls of the room seemed to curve inward. I gripped the frame to steady myself. My throat felt raw.

“What... are you doing?” The words came out hoarse, barely audible.

Victoria didn’t even flinch. She slid off the desk with practiced grace, her heels clicking softly against the floor. She didn’t bother to cover herself. Instead, she smoothed her skirt slowly, deliberately, like a woman certain of her position.

“Oh, Elena.” Her voice was syrupy. “Still so literal.”

Alexander stepped back, adjusting his belt with the same ease he used to straighten his tie before a press conference. “I suppose we should talk.”

“Talk?” My voice cracked. “You were—” I pointed, my hand trembling. “On your desk. With her. My best friend.”

“Don’t be dramatic,” he said, his tone clipped and vaguely irritated. “It’s unbecoming.”

Victoria walked toward him, linking her arm through his like it was the most natural thing in the world. Her perfume hit me again—jasmine and something expensive. My stomach lurched.

“Our marriage,” Alexander began, “has always been practical. Your image—brilliant doctor, loyal partner—helps my public life. In exchange, you enjoy the privileges of being Mrs. Sterling.”

I stared at him, numb.

“But love?” He shrugged. “That was never part of the deal.”

“Deal?” I whispered. “We stood before God. You held my hands and promised—”

Victoria laughed. It was cold and amused, like the punchline of a cruel joke. “Darling, you really believed that ceremony meant something?”

I turned to her, the woman who used to sleep on my couch during med school finals. Who cried with me when we lost our baby. Who helped me pick out the necklace I gave Alexander last Christmas.

“How long?” I asked.

Her eyes sparkled. “Two years.” She glanced at her nails. “Though technically, we had an understanding even before that.”

Two years. Half the marriage. Every late night. Every excuse. Every lie.

“Why?” I choked out. “Why not just leave me?”

Alexander moved behind the desk and pulled open a drawer. He retrieved a thick manila folder and slid it across the polished wood toward me.

“I couldn’t afford a scandal,” he said simply. “But I knew you’d eventually find out. So I prepared.”

Inside the folder were documents. Dozens of pages. Incident reports. Patient complaints. Performance reviews flagged with red ink. Things I’d handled. Things I’d forgotten. Taken out of context, they painted me as careless. Reckless. Dangerous.

“You’ve been collecting these?” My voice was barely a whisper. “Building a case?”

“Insurance,” he said. “To discourage any... rash decisions on your part.”

Victoria leaned against the edge of the desk, folding her arms. “We’ve been careful, Elena. Very careful. But if you go public with this, if you try to play the victim—well, let’s just say the medical board might have concerns.”

I looked down at the papers in my hands, the carefully curated evidence of my supposed incompetence. My fingers trembled. My breath came shallow.

How long had I been sleepwalking through this life?

Alexander straightened his tie.

“So,” he said, with the finality of a man closing a deal. “Do we have an understanding?”

The folder slipped from my hands. The pages spilled across the floor like ash, fluttering in the still air.

I took a step back.

Then another.

From the threshold, I looked at them—my husband and my best friend—standing side by side, united in their betrayal. There was no remorse in their faces. No shame.

Only certainty.

But in that moment, something inside me cracked open. Not broken. Not defeated.

Awakened.

They had no idea what they’d just started.

Chapter 2

The morning light filtered through the curtains, casting a pale glow across our bedroom. Alexander had slept in the guest room last night, not even bothering to make up an excuse. I'd spent the night staring at the ceiling, replaying the scene in the study over and over, each time hoping for a different ending—one where I'd misunderstood, where there was some explanation that wouldn't shatter my world.

But morning brought no such mercy.

I dragged myself from bed, my body heavy with exhaustion. The house was quiet; Alexander must have left early for a meeting. Or perhaps he was with her. The thought sent a fresh wave of nausea through me.

As I made my way downstairs to the kitchen, desperate for coffee to clear the fog in my head, something glinted on the marble counter. I approached slowly, already knowing what I would find.

A sapphire bracelet. Victoria's.

My fingers hovered over the delicate chain, the deep blue stones catching the light. It was unmistakably hers—I'd admired it at a charity luncheon just weeks ago. She'd smiled and said Alexander had exquisite taste in jewelry.

Now I understood the hidden meaning behind her words, the secret joke at my expense.

She'd left it deliberately. A silent trophy of conquest, placed where I couldn't miss it. A reminder that she had been here, in my home, with my husband.

I clutched the edge of the counter, fighting back another wave of nausea. This one felt different, more intense than the emotional sickness that had plagued me since yesterday. I rushed to the bathroom just off the kitchen, barely making it in time.

As I rinsed my mouth afterward, a terrible suspicion formed. I'd been so consumed by work, by trying to be the perfect wife for Alexander, that I hadn't noticed my missed period. The fatigue I'd attributed to long hospital shifts. The tenderness in my breasts I'd ignored.

I kept an emergency test in the master bathroom—bought months ago during a brief period of hope when Alexander had seemed interested in starting a family.

With trembling hands, I retrieved the box from the back of the cabinet and followed the instructions. Three minutes. The longest three minutes of my life.

I sat on the edge of the bathtub, staring at the white stick as if I could will it to give me the answer I wanted. But what answer was that? A child had been my dream—our dream, I'd thought. Now?

Two pink lines appeared, stark and undeniable.

Tears blurred my vision as I stared at the positive result. A life growing inside me. A child conceived in what I had believed was love, now revealed as a lie.

I don't know how long I sat there, cradling the test in my palm, tears streaming down my face. The sound of the front door opening jolted me back to reality. Alexander's footsteps in the foyer, the rustle of his newspaper.

A cold resolve settled over me. He needed to know. Whatever happened next, he needed to know.

I found him at the breakfast table, scrolling through emails on his tablet, a cup of coffee steaming beside him. He didn't look up as I entered.

Without a word, I placed the positive pregnancy test on the table in front of him.

Alexander barely glanced at it, his eyes flicking to the test and then back to his screen. ""Congratulations,"" he said, his voice devoid of emotion.

""That's all you have to say?"" My voice was surprisingly steady.

He sighed, setting down his tablet with the exaggerated patience of someone dealing with an unreasonable child. ""What do you want me to say, Elena? That I'm thrilled? That this changes anything?""

""This is your child.""

""A complication, nothing more."" His eyes met mine, cold and calculating. ""I suggest you take care of it. Quietly.""

The casual cruelty of his words stole my breath. ""Take care of it?""

""Don't be naive."" He took a sip of his coffee. ""Your career is demanding. My political future is at a critical juncture. A child doesn't fit into either of our lives right now."" He paused, his tone softening into something more dangerous—false concern. ""Besides, do you really want to bring a child into a marriage like ours?""

Before I could respond, the doorbell rang. Alexander returned to his tablet, dismissing me as effectively as if I'd ceased to exist.

I opened the front door to find Victoria standing there, a practiced smile on her perfect face. She breezed past me without waiting for an invitation.

""Elena, darling, you look terrible."" Her voice dripped with false sympathy. ""Rough night?""

I stood frozen as she made her way to the kitchen, greeting Alexander with a familiarity that twisted the knife deeper. He smiled at her—a real smile, warm and genuine in a way he never looked at me anymore.

""I just came to retrieve something I left behind,"" Victoria said, spotting her bracelet on the counter. She fastened it around her wrist, then turned to me. ""Do you like it? Alexander has such exquisite taste.""

She tilted her head, the movement causing light to catch on something at her throat—a sapphire necklace I'd never seen before, the stones matching her bracelet perfectly.

""A gift,"" she explained, touching the necklace with manicured fingers. ""Alexander thought it would bring out my eyes."" She glanced at my still-flat stomach, her gaze lingering just long enough to tell me she knew. ""Such a thoughtful man, isn't he? Always knowing exactly what a woman needs.""

The test still clutched in my hand suddenly felt like it was burning my skin. Victoria's eyes gleamed with triumph as she registered my pain.

""Well, I should be going. I have a fitting for the Governor's Ball."" She kissed Alexander's cheek, her lips lingering near his ear to whisper something that made him smile.

As she passed me on her way out, she paused. ""Oh, Elena, I meant to tell you—blue has always been more my color than yours. Don't you agree?""

The door closed behind her with a soft click, leaving me standing in the foyer, a positive pregnancy test in my hand and the image of my husband's smile—directed at another woman—burned into my mind.

In that moment, something shifted inside me. The child growing beneath my heart deserved better than this. I deserved better than this.

And for the first time since discovering their betrayal, I felt something beyond pain and shock.

I felt rage.

Chapter 3

I held the scalpel with a surgeon's precision, my hand steady above the exposed heart. The patient's life hung in perfect balance, dependent on each careful movement. One slip, one moment of distraction, and...

'Dr. Vance?'

The voice seemed to come from far away. My mind was elsewhere—in Alexander's study, watching Victoria's legs wrapped around my husband's waist, hearing his cold voice telling me to 'take care of' our unborn child.

'Dr. Vance, we need to ligate the artery now.'

I blinked, the operating room coming back into sharp focus. The patient's open chest cavity. The steady beep of monitors. The concerned eyes of my surgical team above their masks.

My hand had drifted dangerously close to the coronary artery. One millimeter more and I would have nicked it, causing a catastrophic bleed.

'Yes, of course,' I murmured, correcting my position. 'Forceps, please.'

I completed the procedure on autopilot, my body remembering what my distracted mind couldn't focus on. When we finally closed, the head nurse gave me a searching look.

'Are you alright, Dr. Vance? You seemed... elsewhere today.'

'Just tired,' I lied, stripping off my gloves and mask. 'Long week.'

In the scrub room, I leaned against the sink, my legs suddenly weak. What was happening to me? I'd never lost focus during surgery before. Never put a patient at risk because of personal problems.

The door swung open, and Sarah Jenkins, a fellow surgeon and the closest thing I had to a friend at the hospital, stepped in.

'Elena, we need to talk.'

Her voice was gentle but firm—the same tone she used with difficult patients. I knew what was coming.

'I'm fine, Sarah.'

'No, you're not.' She crossed her arms. 'You nearly severed Mrs. Rodriguez's coronary artery in there. That's not fine. That's not you.'

I turned away, washing my hands with mechanical precision. 'I had it under control.'

'Take some leave, Elena. Whatever's going on in your personal life—'

'I can't,' I interrupted, my voice sharper than I intended. 'I can't take leave right now.'

If I stepped away from the hospital, even for a week, Alexander would seize the opportunity. Any absence would be twisted into evidence of instability, incompetence. The file he'd compiled against me would grow thicker.

Sarah's reflection in the mirror looked concerned. 'Elena, as your colleague and friend, I'm worried. You're one of the best surgeons I know, but today...' She hesitated. 'Today you were dangerous.'

The word hit me like a physical blow. Dangerous. The antithesis of everything I'd worked to become.

'It won't happen again,' I promised, meeting her eyes in the mirror. 'I just need to compartmentalize better.'

Sarah looked unconvinced but nodded. 'If you change your mind about the leave, I'll support you. Just... take care of yourself, okay?'

The irony of her choice of words wasn't lost on me. Take care of yourself. Take care of it. The language of disposal, of problems to be eliminated.

When I arrived home that evening, the house was quiet but not empty. Alexander's presence was palpable—a heaviness in the air, a sense of waiting.

I found him in his study, the scene of my humiliation. He sat behind his desk, a folder open before him, not bothering to look up as I entered.

'You're late,' he said, his tone conversational but with an edge that raised the hair on my arms.

'Surgery ran long.'

'Hmm.' He finally raised his eyes to mine. 'I hope you were more focused there than you've been at home.'

My stomach clenched. Did he somehow know about my near-mistake? Was he having me watched at the hospital too?

He pushed a document across the desk toward me. 'I've scheduled the procedure for tomorrow afternoon. These are the consent forms. Sign them.'

I didn't reach for the papers. 'Alexander, this is my body. Our child. Don't I get any say?'

'You had your say when you married me.' His voice remained eerily calm. 'When you agreed to be the perfect political wife. A scandal—a messy divorce with a child involved—doesn't fit that agreement.'

'So I have no choice?'

'Of course you do.' He leaned back, steepling his fingers. 'You can sign these papers and continue your career as Dr. Vance, respected surgeon. Or you can refuse, and by this time tomorrow, the medical board will be reviewing evidence of your... instability.'

My blood ran cold. 'What evidence?'

'Today's near-miss in the OR would be a good start.' His smile didn't reach his eyes. 'Did you think I wouldn't know? I have eyes everywhere, Elena. Even in your precious hospital.'

The room seemed to tilt beneath my feet. He'd been watching me, waiting for me to make a mistake he could use against me.

'The papers will be here until sunset,' he said, returning to his work. 'After that, I make the decision for you.'

I stumbled from the study, my vision blurring with unshed tears. In our bedroom—no, my bedroom now—I sank onto the edge of the bed, my hand instinctively moving to my still-flat stomach.

'I'm sorry,' I whispered to the tiny life inside me. 'I'm so sorry.'

The next day passed in a fog. I moved through the hospital like a ghost, avoiding Sarah's concerned glances, going through the motions of my rounds.

At four o'clock, I found myself in a private pre-op room, wearing a hospital gown instead of my white coat. A different kind of vulnerability.

Alexander hadn't come. Instead, he'd sent his lawyer—a thin, severe man with cold eyes—to witness my signature on the final consent forms.

'Mrs. Sterling,' the lawyer said, using the name I never used professionally, 'please sign here.'

My hand trembled as I took the pen. The words on the form swam before my eyes: 'voluntary termination,' 'informed consent,' 'release of liability.'

Clinical terms for the death of hope.

As I pressed the pen to paper, a single tear fell, smudging the ink of my signature. The lawyer pretended not to notice, collecting the forms with efficient detachment.

'The doctor will be with you shortly,' he said, closing his briefcase. 'Mr. Sterling sends his... regrets that he couldn't be here.'

Left alone, I stared at the ceiling, feeling hollow. In just a few minutes, they would come for me. They would take me to a room not unlike the ones where I performed surgeries. They would end the life inside me—the life that, despite everything, I had begun to love.

And somewhere across town, Alexander was probably with Victoria, neither of them sparing a thought for what they had forced me to do.

As the door opened and the nurse entered to prepare me for the procedure, a strange calm settled over me. This would be the last time Alexander Sterling took something from me. The very last time.",2,1754582253.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1mk3wji,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mk3wji/find_out_why_laoion_espresso_maker_stands_out_in/,Find Out Why LAOION Espresso Maker Stands Out in This Detailed Review,"Testing out the LAOION Espresso Maker, model Espresso Maker, has truly been an interesting ride. As someone who constantly brews coffee, I was excited to try out this portable, electric Cuban coffee maker. Promising features like overheat protection, a detachable base, and an aesthetically pleasing metallic finish, I was curious to see if it lived up to the hype. Although it performed admirably overall, a few hiccups couldn’t be ignored.

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, I was impressed by the modern and compact design. Its black finish with metallic touches makes it look premium without being overly flashy. At just 7.48 inches wide and weighing 2.56 pounds, it’s lightweight and fits conveniently on my limited kitchen counter space. The transparent top was a feature I didn’t think I’d care for, but seeing the brewing process through it added a new layer of satisfaction. Portable enough to toss into a bag for travel, the sturdy construction still held up even during my clumsy handling. The detachable base made cleaning less of a chore, though I wish the power cord had been slightly longer.

**Performance and Usability**  
Setting up this coffee wonder was straightforward. Thanks to its semi-automatic operation, all it took was filling water to the safety valve, adding ground coffee into the reusable filter, tightening it, and powering it on. Within about five minutes, I had rich, aromatic coffee in hand! It has redefined quick brewing for me. The six-cup capacity is perfect for sharing coffee moments with family or houseguests, though you can reduce it to three cups if you’re serving solo. Auto shut-off safety features kept my distracted mornings worry-free – no risk of leaving it running too long! 

Check [LAOION Espresso Maker] price on Amazon.

**Key Benefits**   
- Easy operation with buttons and clear instructions.  
- Safeguards like auto shut-off and non-slip base for safe brewing.  
- Reusable filter reduces waste while brewing.  
- Ideal for both home and travel scenarios due to its compact size.  
- Transparent top for observing the brewing process.  

**Disadvantages**  
Not everything is perfect, though:  
- The lower pot is aluminum, which doesn’t feel as luxe as stainless steel.  
- The aluminum can stain with hard water if not dried properly.  
- Its power cord could be longer for better flexibility in placement.  

**Competitors**  
When stacked up against similar compact coffee makers, it shines in portability and visual appeal. Compared to stovetop models like the traditional Italian Moka pot, this electric version eliminates the fuss of finding a stove. Brands like Bialetti still lead in design longevity, but this model allows for safer brewing with its auto shut-off. However, if you value highly customizable coffee settings, machines like the Nespresso Vertuo stand ahead with their pod system, though at a significantly higher cost.

**Cost-Efficiency**  
For an affordable espresso maker, this product delivers well. Its price-to-feature ratio means serious coffee lovers can enjoy the essence of Italian coffee without spending a fortune. Budget-friendly machines in this range generally don’t offer premium portability or safety features like this one. However, potential buyers should also weigh the material limitations of aluminum, which might shorten this coffee maker’s lifespan over heavy daily use.

1mk3tnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mk3tnf/explore_the_best_coffee_maker_breville_nespresso/,Explore the Best Coffee Maker Breville Nespresso VertuoPlus and See If It Delivers,"Breville Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Machine, model BNV420GRY1BUC1, had been sitting enticingly on my counter, begging to be tested. As an avid coffee drinker with an unpredictable schedule and an undeniable craving for quality, I decided over several weeks to make this machine part of my daily routine. Spoiler alert: it's pretty impressive, but not without quirks.

**Aesthetics That Please the Eye**  
The design of this machine screams modern sophistication in a compact package. Balancing a sleek grey finish with a minimalist silhouette, this coffee and espresso maker complements just about any kitchen. The rotating water tank, which allows for flexible placement on the counter, came as a pleasant surprise during setup. For someone like me, constantly rearranging kitchen gadgets to fit my cooking mood, the adjustable tank was a blessing. 

**Effortless Brewing Experience**  
Using this machine is gloriously foolproof. With a single press of a button, you’re halfway to coffee heaven. The one-touch technology simplifies the process, be it morning brain fog or a rushed afternoon. The machine reads barcodes on the capsules (fancy, right?) to calibrate every brew – no fiddling with settings, no drama. Sizes range from single espresso shots to full 8-ounce cups, perfect for mornings when I can’t decide between a double shot of ambition or a leisurely larger cup.  

[Check Breville Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Machine price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b01n13vkqn/)

**Flavors for Every Mood**  
Each brew is as customizable as my mood swings. Whether I wanted bold and robust for work motivation or mild and creamy on a relaxing Saturday, the variety of options left nothing to desire. I even experimented with the iced coffee feature by pouring over ice – my attempt at recreating that so-called café experience at home. And yes, I may have serenaded the machine when it hit the perfect latte note.

**Upsides**  
- User-friendly one-touch operation for busy mornings or lazy afternoons  
- The rotating water tank provides flexibility for tricky counter spaces  
- High-quality coffee and espresso brews that rival cafés  
- Compact yet attractive design that doesn’t hog counter space  

**Hiccups in the System**  
While this coffee maker delivers superior coffee experiences most of the time, there are a couple of aspects where it stumbles.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Capsules are the only compatible option, which can feel limiting (and pricey!)  
- Regular descaling is necessary to keep it purring like a kitten – not a deal-breaker but certainly a factor for the forgetful folks like me  
- The noise level during brewing isn’t quiet enough to let sleeping partners dream of coffee instead of being startled awake  

**Peer Products**  
Naturally, curious as I am, I compared this gadget to other machines in the market. Keurig's single-serve models, for instance, allow more versatility in terms of brew methods since you can use both capsules and reusable pods. But the quality of coffee from this Nespresso outshines any other pods I’ve tasted. For die-hard espresso fans, the traditional Italian espresso makers, like De’Longhi, are worth a look, but their learning curve feels steeper. The VertuoPlus perfectly hits that sweet spot of ease without compromise on quality.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
This machine sits in the premium segment for single-serve brewers, and the cost of capsules might deter the budget-buyer. However, the ability to brew barista-grade coffee at the touch of a button made it feel like a justified indulgence. Value, after all, is subjective. If you're like me and need coffee that sings with rich, aromatic notes in every sip, the investment feels worthwhile.

Large seats, separate from others, big TV, multiple meals served with real silverware, etc. definitely worth the ~$100 more ticket. 

After this experience, I purchased a $99 upgrade to premium economy for my upcoming Alaska flight from EWR to SFO, expecting that I would get something at least similarly as nice (I know not international, but still a pretty far flight), but I was quite disappointed. The only thing I got different from any other economy ticket was 4 inches of extra legroom (seat still just as small and cramped as others) and boarding with group B. No extra drinks, food, even a snack box. They only came once for soft drinks (for everyone) at the start of the 6 hour flight, and nothing else. I tried to flag a flight attendant potentially to get a coffee or another drink, and was ignored. There was then an announcement made that for any food or drinks service for the rest of the flight we would need to go to the back of the plane and get it. Not much for ""free alcoholic drinks service all flight"" which is the first bullet point in the premium economy beneifts list. 

Does the experience get better for other routes perhaps? I am just pretty disappointed in comparison for what I got for the same upgrade price, don't think I will ever purchase it again. ",0,1754582010.0,AlaskaAirlines,6,0.2,False

1mk3rh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1mk3rh5/reveal_why_the_best_electric_kettle_aarke_1244_is/,Reveal Why the Best Electric Kettle Aarke 1244 Is Worth the Hype,"Testing out the Aarke 1244 electric kettle has been an unexpectedly enjoyable experience, considering how many kettles I’ve burned through (quite literally) over the years. From its polished stainless steel exterior to its thoughtful safety-focused designs, this product feels like a sophisticated addition to any kitchen setup. With its 1.2-liter capacity and emphasis on quiet, energy-efficient operation, the kettle isn’t just about boiling water; it’s about doing so in style and with purpose.

**Beautiful Design and Build Quality**  
This is not your average, clunky countertop appliance. The sleek stainless steel finish looks almost too good to use, making it a perfect match for anyone who appreciates modern kitchen aesthetics. Its dimensions, roughly 5.5 inches by 7.5 inches by 10.6 inches, allow it to fit comfortably on most kitchen counters without taking up valuable space. The handle grip feels solid yet ergonomic, and it has a premium weight to it at 5.69 pounds, which doesn’t make it too heavy to maneuver but also assures you of its quality. 

Not to mention, the 360-degree swivel base is a small yet impactful design choice, especially when multiple hands are using the kettle throughout the day. It’s incredibly convenient to plop the kettle back onto the base without fussing over alignment.

**Energy Efficiency and Quiet Performance**  
I value appliances that are quieter, particularly during early mornings when I'm trying not to wake up the entire family. This kettle takes the crown for being remarkably quiet while it boils water. The secret lies in its heat-retaining double-wall construction, which not only muffles noise but also retains heat more effectively. This feature is a game-changer for anyone who finds themselves reheating the same water multiple times—we’ve all been there. 

**[Check Aarke 1244 price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b0cwhk6xzp/)**

Beyond silence, the energy efficiency is another highlight. Aarke has prioritized sustainability here, making it a sensible choice for people trying to consume less energy. Whether I’m brewing tea, crafting the perfect pour-over coffee, or even warming up water for a hot water bottle, I’ve noticed a difference in both speed and temperature consistency compared to cheaper alternatives.

**Safety First**  
One of the standout features for me is the dry boil protection. If you’re as forgetful as I am—and I’ve accidentally left kettles running more times than I like to admit—this feature is a lifesaver. The kettle automatically powers off when it detects a lack of water, sparing both the product and my nerves. Additionally, the non-drip spout is fantastic. Pouring from this kettle feels controlled and mess-free; no more puddles on the counter from a leaky spout. 

It goes even further with its smooth-opening lid, thoughtfully designed to prevent hot water droplets from splashing around. This detail might seem minor, but trust me, when you’re making tea half-asleep, it can save you from a nasty burn.

**Strengths**  
- Polished and durable stainless steel design that fits into any modern kitchen.
- Exceptionally quiet operation, making it ideal for early risers or shared living spaces.  
- The double-wall construction helps retain heat, reducing the need for constant re-boiling.  
- Safety features like dry boil protection and a cleverly designed lid prevent accidents.  

**Critiques**  
- The kettle isn’t lightweight, which some might find cumbersome for everyday use.  
- Its lack of precise temperature control makes it unsuitable for brewing delicate teas.  
- It requires manual cleaning, and you’ll want to be thorough to keep its sheen.  

**Product Rivals**  
When comparing the Aarke 1244 to other premium electric kettles like the Breville Smart Kettle Luxe or the Fellow Stagg EKG, a clearer picture emerges. While the Aarke excels in design and safety features, its simpler functionality might leave tea connoisseurs yearning for more. Breville’s Smart Kettle provides adjustable temperature settings ideal for different teas, though it doesn’t match the aesthetic appeal of the Aarke. 

The Fellow Stagg EKG takes precision a step further with its gooseneck spout, doubling as a fantastic companion for pour-over coffee enthusiasts. Yet, for all these extras, it’s louder and prone to showing wear over time. The double-wall construction of the Aarke keeps it quieter and more durable in the long run.

**Value for Money**  
Durable doesn’t come cheap, but this stainless steel kettle feels like a purchase you won’t regret. While there are cheaper kettles available, they often lack the high-quality materials, energy efficiency, or safety features Aarke integrates seamlessly. In my opinion, the cost is justified for anyone who values longevity and performance over short-term savings.

I’ve seen quite a few posts here about mold, however in my case I only have the symptoms but I don’t physically see any of it. Extreme fatigue, difficulty, concentrating, constantly sleepy, and foggy. I already have quite bad anemia, so all of these are exacerbated. I noticed that whenever I’m somewhere for work or vacation, whether it’s a different city in Germany or out of the country entirely, I don’t really have such severe fatigue. Even my bf said whenever he stays at mine he’s somehow more tired.

It’s a studio apartment of 40 m² and between the months of June until October my windows are pretty much open 247 (kipped). When I dry my clothes, they’re in the middle of the room, no other way to do it since it’s such a small apartment and there’s no communal space or anything like that.

I don’t really notice that there’s a humidity issue. There’s no weird smell or stuffiness or anything like that.

I do have a disgusting old air vent in my bathroom (no windows in there, been this way since I moved in a year ago). I tried to clean it, but it is so dirty that I think the only solution is to have it replaced. I’m waiting on my landlord to give me more info on that.

I know all of this is quite vague, but I’ve really been struggling with such EXTREME fatigue that it’s hindering my everyday life, my mood, my work, and I am kind of running out of ideas how to make it better (without uprooting my entire life and moving to the Mediterranean lol). Doesn’t matter how many hours I sleep. The entire day I’ll feel so groggy…like you know that feeling when you first wake up and you haven’t had your coffee yet and you haven’t even properly opened your eyes yet? Well…that’s how I feel pretty much throughout the entire day.

The tests that I’ve looked up online are quite expensive so I was wondering if anyone has experience with something similar — have you been able to get your landlord to inspect? Do you have any other advice for me? Any other theories what I could be struggling with? 😅

I’ve ordered an air filter and will see if that makes any positive changes.

Blair’s POV

I’ve been Christian’s Luna for five years.

But he never marked me. Never sealed the mate bond with me.

Every time I brought it up, he’d brush me off with a smile. “Blair, I’m too busy. Pack matters are piling up. Sealing the mate bond? What difference does it make?”

And I believed him. I always did. Until today.

I saw it with my own eyes—Christian, standing before the pack elders, sealing the mate bond… with my twin sister Carrie, the one who vanished five years ago.

In that moment, my wolf let out a low, guttural growl inside me, her claws tearing at my heart.

Carrie’s eyes were red with tears as she threw herself into his arms, gripping the bond-sealing contract tightly.

“Christian, it was my fault… I left you at the altar…” Her voice trembled. “I know you’re only agreeing to this because I have cancer. But I still have to ask—after all these years, did you ever forget me? Did you actually fall in love with Blair?”

He was silent for what felt like a century.

I stood nearby, my nails digging deep into my palms. Blood trickled down my fingers. Even my wolf was trembling.

“No,” he finally said, voice cold as a winter frost. “Never.”

Carrie instantly broke into tears of joy. She rose on tiptoe and kissed him.

And him… his hand hovered for a moment—then settled on her waist, deepening the kiss.

“No—!”

My wolf let out a furious roar. A violent storm surged through my veins. My fingertips went numb, my bones tensing until I could feel my claws threatening to break through skin.

But none of them looked my way. Not even once.

Beeeeeeep—

A car horn blared, sharp and sudden. I jerked my head up.

Three black Maybachs pulled up nearby. Out stepped the three Alphas of the Bloodstone Pack—my three older brothers: Lysander, Orion, and Zayden.

“The bond-sealing deal’s signed? Mate bond sealed too?” Zayden clapped his hands. “Great. Restaurant’s booked. Let’s go celebrate.”

Cold seeping into my bones like I'd been thrown into an Arctic sea.

These were the same brothers who made me breakfast this morning with their own hands.

Carrie sobbed as she ran into their arms, like a little girl finally returning home. “I thought… I thought you all didn’t want me anymore…”

The three of them exchanged glances, their expressions complicated. In the end, Zayden reached out and ruffled her hair, tone indulgent like always. “Silly girl. You’ve been causing trouble since you were little. When have we not cleaned up your mess?”

Carrie wiped her tears away and looped her arms through theirs like it was second nature. The four of them walked into the cars, all smiles and laughter.

Not one of them looked back at me.

Only when their cars disappeared from view did I finally collapse against a tree—like my heart had just been ripped out.

The bark scraped my skin, but that pain was nothing compared to the way my heart had been torn wide open.

Carrie was always the one everyone adored. Ever since we were kids.

We were twins—but we were never equals.

When I had a fever, my brothers took her to the amusement park. When I spent my birthday alone, she got gifts from the entire pack with my brothers at her side.

I crushed on Christian for ten years—he was my fated mate—but one look from her, and he rejected me and kissed her hand instead.

I thought it was my fate—to be unloved, to be the forgotten placeholder.

Until she ran away from her own wedding.

Wearing a million-dollar gown, she eloped with an Omega and dragged two packs through the mud.

That night, my brothers announced I was their only sister from then on.

And that same night, Christian stumbled drunk into my room.

He pinned me against the wall, twirling my damp hair around his fingers, eyes hazy.

“You look just like her…”

Then he pulled out the wedding ring meant for Carrie… and slipped it onto my finger.

“She’s gone. So… be my Luna. You’re my mate anyway, right?”

I knew I shouldn’t have said yes. But I loved him too much. For far too long.

For five years, he treated me like royalty.

Sapphires, Eiffel Tower dates, diamonds, candlelit banquets—anything I so much as glanced at, he’d have it procured and laid at my feet.

Whenever I had nightmares, he’d drop everything and hold me close, whispering comfort in my ear.

Even my brothers changed. It was like Carrie never existed.

I thought, maybe… maybe I finally had love that belonged to me.

But Carrie came back.

And all that love began to recede like the tide, pulling me away one inch at a time.

I watched the Maybachs disappear, and I couldn’t hold it in anymore—I laughed.

At first, it was low and shaky. Then it grew louder, sharper, uncontrollable. I doubled over, laughing until tears mixed with blood fell to the ground.

Passersby stared. No one came near.

They didn’t understand—I wasn’t crazy. My heart had simply been chewed up and spit out.

Turns out, these past few years—I was just a thief.

I stole her love, her title, and even her Alpha.

And now she was back.

Which meant I, the substitute, had to step aside.

I wiped my tears and straightened up. My wolf howled inside me, raging, tearing apart every last trace of soft illusions.

“If all of you… only ever loved her…”

I spat each word like venom, “Then I don’t want any of you either.”

I raised my hand and flagged down a cab.

Half an hour later, I pushed open a heavy door and walked up to the front desk.

“I’d like to buy an uninhabited island.”

The receptionist froze, stunned. Then quickly called for the owner.

He was in his forties, sharp and cautious. “Luna, the island you chose has no signal, no route access. Supply boats only visit every three months. Once you’re there, you’ll be completely cut off. Are you sure?”

I looked him dead in the eye, gaze as cold and wild as a feral beast.

“I’m sure.”

# Chapter 2

Blair’s POV

The shop owner glanced at my red-rimmed eyes but thought better than to ask.

He quickly sorted through the documents, speaking respectfully. “We’ll finalize the paperwork as soon as possible. Once everything’s ready, we’ll notify you immediately about the departure to the island.”

Without hesitation, I signed my name and pulled a black card from my wallet. My movements were sharp and decisive. As the payment went through, my hand didn’t tremble in the slightest—like the wolf inside me had already stopped struggling and turned to ice.

Outside, darkness had swallowed the sky. The clouds hung low, and the air carried the metallic tang of a gathering storm.

Back at the pack house, I stepped into the foyer—only to be hit with the warm glow of lights… and the sound of familiar, yet foreign, laughter.

My pupils constricted.

Christian was sitting on the couch, smiling as he peeled an apple for Carrie. His fingers were long and graceful, moving with the precision of someone sculpting a lover’s statue. My three brothers were sitting nearby, loyal guards standing watch.

“Carrie,” Orion coaxed gently, “take the medicine.”

“It’s so bitter…” Carrie whined, her voice all sweet and delicate.

Zayden immediately pulled out a piece of chocolate from his pocket. “This was your favorite as a kid. I always keep one on me.”

I stood frozen at the doorway, my fingertips digging hard into my palm. Blood slowly seeped out—but I felt nothing.

“Blair?” Christian was the first to notice me. He got up and walked toward me. “Where were you all day? I didn’t see you once.”

His voice was soft. Like he wasn’t the same man who stood right in front of me earlier—sealing the mate bond with Carrie.

I didn’t answer. My gaze slid past him and landed on Carrie—the sister who’d once run away from her wedding and shattered my entire life.

Christian followed my eyes, then offered a quiet explanation. “Carrie’s sick. Terminal. She just wants to spend her last days with family. I know she was wrong to run back then, but she’s still your sister. For your sake—”

“For my sake?” I let out a laugh, cold and low. My voice rumbled into a growl. “Or is it because you never actually let her go?”

His expression darkened. “Blair…”

“Blair.” Lysander—my eldest brother—stepped up. He reached for my head out of habit but froze mid-air, changing the gesture into a pat on my shoulder. “Carrie doesn’t have much time left. It’s not like our pack can’t afford to take care of one more person…”

“Yeah,” Orion chimed in, “She’s been through a lot out there. She knows she messed up. But we’re family.”

“You’re the sensible one, right?” Zayden said from behind me, voice laced with pressure.

I clenched my jaw. My wolf snarled inside me, thrashing, ready to tear everything apart—but there was no outlet for her rage.

Finally, I muttered, “Fine.”

Finally, satisfied smiles spread across their faces.

“Keep Carrie company,” Christian said. “We’ll go prepare a room for her.”

After they went upstairs, Carrie slowly rose from the couch and walked over. Her face looked pale, but the gleam in her eyes betrayed her delight.

“Blair, it’s been five years. I brought you a little gift.”

I instinctively took a step back. Every instinct screamed that something was wrong.

She smiled sweetly as she shoved a box wrapped in black ribbon into my arms—then, ever so thoughtfully, lifted the lid.

“AH—!”

A pitch-black snake shot out of the box and sank its fangs deep into my wrist.

The pain hit me like lightning, tearing straight through nerves and bone. I almost screamed.

I flung the box away in pure panic—hitting her square in the shoulder.

She dropped to the floor with a dramatic shriek. “Ow! It hurts!”

Thundering footsteps echoed from upstairs. All four men rushed down—only to see Carrie on the ground in tears, and me, standing in a pool of blood, venom dripping from my wrist.

“What the hell are you doing?!” Christian roared, shoving me aside.

I stumbled, crashing into the coffee table. Something in my ribcage cracked.

“She put a snake in the box...” I rasped, voice barely audible.

“Bullshit!” Zayden’s roar made my ears ring. “Carrie’s body is too weak—how the hell could she hurt you?!”

“Christian… Orion… please... I just wanted to make peace with Blair,” Carrie sobbed, crawling into Orion’s arms. “I don’t know why she misunderstood me like this…”

Cold seeped into every inch of my body. I tried to reach for the box—to prove I wasn’t lying—but Christian gripped my injured wrist and yanked me back.

“Enough!” he snapped, hurling me aside. The twin puncture marks on my wrist were clear as day. “She’s your sister! And you would pull a stunt like this?!”

They scooped Carrie into their arms and left—without once looking back.

I collapsed to my knees—the venom spread fast, my vision blurred and my ears buzzed like bees trapped in my skull. Something inside me was screaming.

“Luna! Luna!” I barely made out Lexie’s voice—the maid of the packhouse in charge of cleaning.

I forced my eyes open, but everything was a blur. I could only see the ceiling.

They rushed me to the hospital. But what I heard next—

“Sorry, all the pack doctors are treating Carrie. Her condition suddenly worsened. Orders are in—only she gets care today.”

I laughed—a broken, blood-choked sound, a wolf’s howl dying somewhere deep in my throat.

Lexie screamed through tears, “Luna’s dying! If you let her die, I swear I’ll report you to the Alpha Council!”

No one listened.

I fumbled for my phone and called Christian. My voice was barely a whisper.

“I… got bitten by a venomous snake… can your pack… send a healer…”

“Blair!” His voice on the other end was glacial. “Carrie’s condition worsened after you pushed her! And you’re still playing games?!”

“It wasn’t me… I swear…”

Click. He hung up.

I stared at the screen, stunned. Tears slid silently down my face. Pain—sharp, burning pain—ripped through every inch of my body. But worse than that… was the ache in my heart.

My wolf howled inside me, but no one answered.

I slowly closed my eyes. And wished I could disappear—forever.

# Chapter 3

Blair’s POV

The sharp scent of antiseptic filled my nose as I opened my eyes. It burned all the way to my scalp.

“Luna! You’re finally awake!” Lexie threw herself to my bedside, eyes swollen, gripping my cold fingers like they were her lifeline. Her hands were rough—but somehow, they carried a warmth I’d almost forgotten.

“I…” My throat felt torn to shreds. I could barely speak. “How… did I survive?”

Tears spilled from her eyes again. “A kind-hearted healer. He was just visiting our pack and happened to see the snake that bit you. He went to the infirmary, realized you were poisoned, and… he couldn’t just stand by.”

“He risked being punished and injected you with antivenom in secret. He said… if it had been ten minutes later, you wouldn’t have made it.”

My heart gave a jolt.

“I begged Alpha Lysander to believe you’d been bitten,” Lexie choked out, her voice trembling. “He said you were faking it. Alpha Orion refused to even see me. And Alpha Zayden… he said you deserved it.”

I clenched the blanket, nails digging into my palm—yet I felt no pain.

“Alpha Christian was the worst!” she nearly sobbed. “I got on my knees and begged him to come check on you. He said… said you were just being dramatic again. Said I was helping you put on a show.”

Lexie held my hand like it was the only thing keeping her grounded. “Luna, you were always so good to them. Last winter, Alpha Lysander came home drunk after a late-night pack summit—you boiled him a bitter tonic in the freezing kitchen and caught a cold yourself.”

“When Alpha Orion got into gambling trouble, you secretly sold your grandmother’s heirloom to pay off his debts. When Zayden had a fever for three days straight, you stayed by his side until you passed out.”

She couldn’t continue, tears choking her voice. “And Alpha Christian… the coffee beans he likes, the brand of ties he wears—things even his mother can’t remember. You remembered everything. And now, they’re all fawning over Carrie. That sister who bullied you your whole life, the one who ran from her wedding like a coward—now she’s the adored Luna?!”

I didn’t say a word.

Tears streamed down my cheeks, soaking the pillow beneath me. They burned like acid, each drop cutting deeper than the last.

But none of that compared to the pain in my chest.

It didn’t matter. It would all be over soon.

I’d already signed the paperwork for the island. A place far from the mainland.

No betrayal. No lies. No them.

Two days later, I returned “home.”

The moment I pushed open the door, I was ambushed by a blast of birthday music—piercing, clawing at my eardrums, tangled with laughter and the clink of champagne glasses.

Under the crystal chandelier, Carrie stood by the cake in a flowing gown, her smile radiant. My three brothers and Christian surrounded her.

The scene was so familiar, it made my stomach turn.

I stood there at the entrance. The air hung heavy and still.

“I thought she was supposed to be dying?” Lysander shot me a cold, cutting glare from behind his glasses.

Orion took a sip of wine, brows furrowed. “She doesn’t have long to live. Can’t you cut her some slack?”

Zayden snorted. “Same old drama. Can’t she come up with a new act?”

Christian walked toward me, that ever-so-gentle façade still in place. “I know you’re upset about my past with Carrie,” he said. “But you have to understand—my Luna, my wife now, is you.”

Luna? Wife?

A loud crack exploded in my head.

I stood by his side through ruin and disaster. Through every storm and sleepless night. I gave him everything.

And now—the one who sealed the mate bond with him, the one who was marked by him… was Carrie.

So this… this is what they called a “fated mate”?

I stared at him, laughing coldly. Even the way my lips curved felt like someone else’s. My heart had been torn apart—but I wasn’t afraid anymore. My blood was boiling. My wolf was awakening.

Then Carrie’s voice rang out, bright and sweet. “Christian, Lysander, Orion, Zayden—come cut the cake with me!”

The big screen lit up. It started off with well-wishes from guests. But just as everyone began to wonder what came next—the screen abruptly changed.

Nude photos of Carrie with a young Omega flashed before the entire pack.

“A birthday gift for you.”

The blood-red words burned into her soul—my answer, carved in flame.

“Turn it off! Now!” Lysander roared.

Orion ripped the power cord from the wall. Zayden tore through the crowd like a madman, snatching guests’ phones.

Carrie stumbled back, pale as a corpse. “You already stole their love… Why are you humiliating me too?!”

Then she collapsed to the floor, sobbing like her world had ended. Christian rushed to scoop her up, his face full of panic.

“Call the healer! Now!”

Before he carried her off, he looked back at me. That look… As if he didn’t know who I was.

Lysander grabbed my arm, voice like rolling thunder. “Blair, look at what you’ve done!”

I gasped, trying to hold it together. “It wasn’t me… I didn’t do it…”

“Still lying?” Orion sneered. “In the Bloodstone Pack, mistakes are punished.”

Punished?

I froze.

When I was twelve, Carrie pushed me down the stairs—it was my fault for being clumsy.

At eighteen, she ruined my birthday cake—they said she was just joking.

That winter, she locked me outside on the balcony—I almost froze to death. They said she was just in a bad mood.

And now—they wanted to punish me?

# Chapter 4

Blair’s POV

“Kneel.”

Zayden’s voice cut through me, cold and sharp as a winter wind, leaving my dignity in shreds.

Two towering warriors lunged forward, grabbing my shoulders with brutal force, like I was some kind of prisoner.

I fought instinctively—my wolf refused to bow—but they were too strong. They slammed me down onto the cold stone floor.

My knees crashed against the ground as pain shooting straight through my bones, and the world blurred for a moment.

Lysander raised the vine whip he’d prepared. It sliced through the air with a shriek. A heartbeat later—

Crack!

Agony ripped across my back like lightning. I bit down hard on my lip, tasting blood, but refused to make a sound.

My wolf raged inside me—furious, rebellious—but I forced her down with sheer willpower.

“Do you admit your mistake?” Lysander’s voice was ice.

“I didn’t do anything wrong…” My voice was hoarse, each word like glass in my throat.

Crack!

This one was worse. The whip tore through the thin fabric of my dress, burning straight into my flesh. Wet heat spread across my back—I was bleeding.

I knew that pain. That wasn’t an ordinary whip. It was a silver-threaded wolf whip, made specifically to punish those who defy the Alpha.

“Do you admit your mistake?”

“I didn’t…”

Again. And again. Each lash meant to break me—not just my body, but my soul.

Blood mixed with the howls of my wolf, roaring inside me. I stayed silent, biting down until I tasted copper. My white dress was soaked in crimson, the floor beneath me painted in a grotesque pattern of red.

“Stop! Please—stop!”

Lexie, the aging maid, fell to her knees, sobbing. “She’s going to die! Luna’s going to die if you keep going!”

But my three brothers didn’t flinch. Didn’t pause. They acted like they couldn’t hear her—like I wasn’t even human.

My vision dimmed. The edges of the world crumbled. All I could hear was Zayden’s mocking voice, “If she won’t admit it, then we’ll beat her until she does.”

The last lash fell—and with it, my consciousness. Darkness swallowed me whole.

And the last thing I saw… was my blood pooling on the ground, and the cold, merciless eyes of the three men who used to be my family.

They were once my brothers. My protectors. My blood. Now? They were the ones holding the blade.

I was locked in a room for three full days with no visitors and no one even brought me water.

My wounds had festered, the silver threads still burning beneath my skin. I curled up on the bed like a dying animal, clinging to life by a thread.

And next door? A different world entirely.

Carrie’s voice drifted through the wall, soft and sweet. My brothers whispering back to her, comforting her. Even Christian’s low laugh echoed in. Each sound cut deep, flaying my heart raw.

“Carrie, take your medicine.”

“Nooo, it’s so bitter…”

“Be good. Finish it and I’ll give you candy.”

“Then Christian, you feed me…”

I buried my face in the pillow, my nails digging into my palms. Wolves heal fast—but not from betrayal.

I thought I was numb. But every breath still stabbed at my chest.

On the fourth morning, I finally managed to stand. Leaning on the wall, I dragged myself to the staircase—and that’s when I heard it.

“There’ve been dolphins near the coast lately,” Christian said, a rare note of excitement in his voice. “Carrie’s always wanted to see them.”

“Then let’s go today,” the three brothers chimed in.

I froze. My fingers trembled against the railing.

My wounds hadn’t even closed. Every step felt like knives slicing through my back.

“Blair?” Carrie looked up and gasped. “You’re finally out of bed!”

All four men turned to me. Their eyes… it was like I was a stranger.

I was nothing but skin and bone, the loose nightgown hanging off me like a sheet while bruises covered my wrists like broken jewelry.

“We’re heading out to see the dolphins,” Carrie said, rushing over and clinging to my arm like we were best friends. “You should come too!”

I pulled away without thinking. Tears instantly welled in her eyes.

“Blair, I already forgave you,” she said, choking up. “Even after you ruined my reputation… I don’t want to hold grudges. I don’t have much time left…”

“Blair!” Christian stormed over and shielded her with his body. “She’s offering you peace, and this is how you respond?”

Zayden scoffed. “Look at Carrie, then look at you. It’s not even close.”

I bit down on my lip until I tasted blood again.

These men—once the ones closest to me—were now more distant than strangers.

They brought me on the yacht, saying it was to make Carrie happy.

The sun blazed down on the deck, so bright I could barely keep my eyes open.

Carrie giggled, suggesting a barbecue.

“I’m dying soon… can’t I at least do what I want?” she murmured, voice soft as silk.

“Don’t talk nonsense!” Orion quickly covered her mouth. “We’ve found the best healer in the entire werewolf realm. You’ll be fine.”

I sat quietly in the corner, watching them fawn over her like she was the only one who mattered.

No one remembered I was allergic to seafood.

No one remembered my back was still an open wound.

No one—cared.

“Why aren’t you eating?” Christian finally noticed me.

“I… I’m allergic to seafood,” I whispered.

The mood shifted immediately. Christian frowned and was about to ask the crew to change the menu—when a sudden gust of wind slammed into the yacht!

The boat lurched, tipping the grill and sending burning coals skittering across the deck.

“Watch out—!”

All four men leapt toward Carrie, shielding her like she was the moon and they were her tides.

And me?

A burning coal landed on my dress, and fire instantly spread across the fabric.

I rolled across the deck, screaming as flames seared through skin and nerves.

But... not a single one of them turned to look at me.

# Chapter 5

Blair’s POV

The four of them were still huddled around Carrie, frantically checking if she was hurt. Her arm was only slightly burned, but they acted like it was the end of the world.

“Carrie! Are you okay?”

“Let me see—any blisters?”

“Get the ointment! Now!”

Meanwhile, I was still burning.

In the end, it was a passing crew member who noticed me. He rushed over, panic in his voice, grabbing the fire extinguisher and dousing the flames consuming my body.

“Miss! Hang in there!” his voice echoed in my ears.

My vision was already blurry. As I looked up, all I saw was the four men carrying Carrie below deck like she was made of glass. Their eyes—every last one of them—were only on her. Not a single glance at me.

They were my brothers, the blood I once trusted, but in my moment of agony, not one of them turned around.

By the time the crew carried me back to my room, every breath I took felt like knives in my chest.

The fire had torn through my skin, the burns so deep they clung to the bone. Every movement sent fresh blood oozing out.

I could feel the wolf inside me howling, trying to trigger my healing instincts. But the silver-lined whip wounds and the burns had suppressed it all—my recovery was crawling at a snail’s pace.

The room was empty—I was completely alone.

My phone buzzed.

I barely managed to lift my arm and answered the call.

“Ms. Swan, we still need a few documents for the private island you purchased.”

“I’ll send them… right away…” I rasped, voice hoarse from pain. “Please, finalize everything. I need to get there… as soon as possible.”

I had nowhere else to go. Nowhere left but that island I’d bought with my own hands—isolated, far away from everything.

But just as I hung up, a cold, all-too-familiar voice sounded behind me.

“Who were you talking to?”

Christian.

I quickly shoved my phone under the covers and forced myself to act calm. “No one.”

He stood at the door, gaze dropping to the burns on my body. His brows instantly furrowed.

“What the hell happened to you?” He strode over, and for once, I heard a rare flicker of panic in his voice. “Why didn’t you call me?”

I looked down and gave him a bitter smile.

Call him?

I was screaming on the deck, my dress on fire, my skin burning, even my hair singed. And yet he, along with the other three, had all lunged for Carrie like she was the only one that mattered. None of them even looked back.

How could I possibly… still call out to him?

“I’m fine,” I whispered. “The healer’s on the way. You should go. Be with Carrie… She needs you more.”

To my surprise, he sat down beside my bed. “She’s got people with her. I’ll stay until you’ve had your wounds treated.”

He reached out and gently brushed the hair from my forehead. The gesture was soft… familiar. But I simply stared at him, calm and distant, the spark I once felt for him completely gone.

He belonged to someone else now—Carrie’s mate.

Her husband.

He had marked her behind my back—sealed the mate bond. From that moment on, there was no going back for us.

“Does it hurt?” he asked softly, brows drawn together.

I shook my head lightly.

Hurt? Of course it did. My skin was splitting, rough like cracked bark, every breeze stinging like acid.

But none of that compared to the pain inside.

The healer arrived quickly, tending to my burns with the utmost care. Every touch was like a knife, but I didn’t make a sound—I bit down and bore it. I didn’t want to scream. My wolf wouldn’t allow me to break down in front of them.

Outside the door, Carrie’s overly sweet voice rang out, “Christian! Come see the dolphins! They’re so beautiful!”

He hesitated, then finally stood and helped me up. “Come with me. Let’s go take a look.”

I didn’t refuse. Didn’t have the strength to.

Out on the deck, the sea shimmered gold beneath the setting sun. A pod of dolphins leapt from the water, their graceful arcs slicing through the waves like something out of a dream.

Carrie clasped her hands and closed her eyes like a child making a wish. “Hurry! Make a wish! I heard if you wish while watching dolphins, it always comes true!”

He laid me gently onto a lounge chair. I sat there, surrounded by faces I once knew—now strangers.

They all closed their eyes, too. People who never believed in this kind of thing, now silently making wishes like devoted believers.

I knew every wish in their hearts… was for her.

I closed my eyes too.

I could feel my wolf growling within me, desperate to break free, to destroy everything, to make them all pay. But I was calmer than her.

I knew I had to survive, to leave this ship, to cut every last tie to my past.

“Blair, what did you wish for?” Carrie leaned over, whispering in my ear—sweet, soft, and enough to make my skin crawl.

The four men turned to me as well.

I opened my eyes and looked at all five of them—faces once dear to me, now nothing but poison.

Then I spoke, clear and slow,

“My wish… is to never see Christian, Lysander, Orion, Zayden, or Carrie… ever again.”

1mk3o1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mk3o1g/very_inconsistent_p64_performance/,Very inconsistent P64 performance,"I have a P64 with Mizen Omni burrs that is about eight weeks old and am experiencing severe inconsistency both in grinding performance and espresso shot timings. I have seasoned the burrs with over 8kg of beans so they should be pretty well seasoned at this point, but the performance is very inconsistent.

Yesterday afternoon I pulled six shots with just a few minutes between each shot in order to eliminate any variables related to weather, humidity, time of day, etc. The results are indicative of the inconsistency that I have been experiencing on a daily basis. 

My setup and prep for each of the shots was:

\- Profitec Ride dual boiler  
\- Coffee: medium/dark espresso blend about three weeks off roast  
\- Water temp: 90C  
\- Input Dose: 17g  
\- Output: Approximately 25g  
\- Prep: flush machine with empty portafilter, dry portafilter, weigh input, 4 sprays RDT (as instructed by Option-O support), grind beans into shaker, weigh output, shake for about 5 seconds, drop from shaker into portafilter, tap portafilter, tamp with spring loaded self leveling tamper, pull shot

The time of day and timings for each of the shots was as follows:

\- 14:14 29 secs  
\- 14:24 13 secs  
\- 14:32 21 secs  
\- 14:40 29 secs  
\- 14:48 25 secs

Just as another data point I did another shot this morning for breakfast (same prep and input/output) and it ran 34 seconds.

I was very careful to be as precise and consistent as possible with my puck prep and while it may not have been perfect it should not have resulted in this level of inconsistency.

Also, I have been experiencing very inconsistent results during the grinding process. There is significant variability in the grind output after the grinder has finished grinding and I have given the top a few taps. Sometimes the output is within a tenth of gram but frequently the output is short from one to as much as six or seven grams. In those cases I have to hit the top of the grinder very hard multiple times to get the remainder of the beans to grind. In the cases where the output is significantly short (five grams or more) I have found that hitting the top is not enough and I have to hit the grinder hard on the side several times to get the remainder of the beans to grind. Note that this is not retention. After hitting the grinder on the side there are additional beans actually grinding. It is like the beans have gotten lodged somewhere. When I reported this to Option-O support they blamed static electricity and advised me to increase RDT beyond the two sprays that I had been doing. I increased RDT to four sprays but that has not helped.

Any suggestions as to how to get this issue resolved would be appreciated. I certainly did not expect this level of inconsistency from an expensive grinder. 

My previous grinder was a DF54 and it performed much more consistently than this P64.

I’m thinking of making a little miniseries but would like your honest criticisms. They would be much appreciated :) With that being said let the story begin!!


On a cold and dreary January morning, Jesse lay lost in thought, startled by the scratching sound emanating from his closet. His eyelids felt so dry that each blink was akin to rubbing them with sandpaper. The scratching persisted, and he dared not move or utter a sound, paralyzed by the fear of what might lurk just beyond the closet door.

Suddenly, a thought struck him: ""It’s probably just Fluffy! He loves rummaging through Mom’s closet; he’s probably just exploring mine!"" The boy’s fear swiftly morphed into annoyance; he didn’t want his cat to tear apart his belongings. Without a moment’s hesitation, he shouted, “Fluffy, get out of there now!” The scratching ceased abruptly, leaving an unsettling silence in its wake. Then, with a cheerful entrance, Fluffy padded into the room, the faint jingle of his orange collar ringing out. But just as quickly, the scratching resumed, now louder and more agitated, almost as if it were expressing annoyance. In a panic, Jesse snatched up his cat and dashed to the living room, deciding to keep his distance from his room until someone could investigate the strange noises.

Earlier that same morning, Jesse's older sister Maddie was preparing for a day trip with a friend. Just as she was finishing up, a faint “Tap, tap, tap” echoed through the air. Assuming it was her brother being impatient, she chose to ignore it. But then came the repeated “tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.” Maddie’s annoyance grew. “Oh my god! Why can’t Jesse just wait? He’s always rushing everything. One day, it’s going to backfire on him.” She called out, “I’m almost ready, Jesse; just give me a minute!” Believing the matter settled, she continued her preparations until a loud “Bang, bang, bang!” jolted the door, rattling it in its frame. “Oh my god, Jesse, relax! I’m leaving!” she yelled again, but the banging ceased, leaving no sign of her brother. 

Pressing her ear to the door, Maddie hoped to hear Jesse on the other side. Though she was certain it was him, an unsettling sense of unease crept over her. Just as she was about to give up, she heard the faint sound of someone breathing heavily, followed by wet-sounding footsteps. “What is that?” Maddie wondered, the pit of anxiety in her stomach deepening. She hesitated, her resolve wavering. Gathering her belongings, she decided it was time to leave. “No more games! It’s just Jesse trying to scare me,” she reassured herself, reaching for the bathroom door lock. Almost instantly, the heavy breathing intensified, and the wet footsteps drew closer to her room. The door shook violently as if someone were ramming into it. Frustrated, she shouted while gripping the handle, “Jesse, what’s your problem? I told you I’d…” But as she swung the door open, the banging stopped, and there was no one there. Her face flushed red, “He thinks he’s so funny!” she thought.

Maddie marched to Jesse's room, only to find him in the living room, clutching Fluffy and trembling like a leaf in November. “What’s wrong with you?” he stammered. Maddie scoffed, “What’s wrong with me? You’re the one banging on the door, freak!” Jesse looked bewildered, smacked his lips, and replied, “What are you talking about? I’ve been here all morning, loser!” They both froze, a heavy silence settling between them until Jesse finally broke it with a single question, “Did you hear any scratching too?” Maddie, perplexed, responded, “No, just banging on the door.” They exchanged glances, uncertainty hanging in the air. “So what are you going to do today?” Jesse asked, his eyes pleading. “Please, please take me with you, sis!” Maddie sighed, “I was going to the mall with Stacy…” Jesse’s expression turned desperate, as if he were peering into her soul. Maddie cringed, “If I let you come, will you stop staring at me like that?” Jesse retorted, “Hey, no need to be rude! …but yeah, can I go with you? You won’t even know I’m there, I promise!” With little choice, they decided to leave for the day, hoping to distract themselves from the strange noises.

As Jesse and Maddie headed out the door, their mother, Lorraine, stumbled in with several bags of groceries. Nearly dropping everything, she called out, “I could use some help with these!” The kids shouted as they rushed to Maddie’s car, “Sorry, Mom, we gotta go for a bit!” Lorraine rolled her eyes and made her way to the kitchen. As she began to unpack the groceries, her husband, Richard, entered from the garage, his hands grimy from working on his car. Frustrated by its refusal to start, he had purchased almost every part needed to get his prized possession running again, but something still eluded him.

Bending down to wash his hands at the kitchen sink, he sighed and turned to Lorraine. “Hey honey, how was grocery shopping?” Lorraine, nearly finished putting everything away, replied, “Oh, not too bad; I found everything I was looking for. What about you? How’s the car coming along?” Richard sighed again, shrugging, “I’m not sure. I bought everything I needed, but I can’t figure out what’s causing the issue; it just won’t start!” Lorraine frowned, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. “I’m sorry, honey; I’m sure you’ll figure it out,” she said softly. Richard shrugged, walking back to the garage. Before closing the door, he added in a defeated tone, “I hope so, Lorraine, I really hope so.”

As Lorraine finished putting away the remaining groceries, a strange sound reached her ears from the living room. It resembled the broken piano they had allowed to collect dust for years. Someone was clicking the keys. A loud “click” echoed, followed by a resonant “thum.” Lorraine froze, unsure if Richard was playing a prank or if the piano was indeed ringing out. The keys began to click rapidly, as if trying to get her attention, almost as if saying, “Hey, look over here!” 

She thought, “Maybe it’s just the kids messing with the piano.” But then she remembered they had left the house not long ago; it couldn’t be them. The keys continued to sound, clicking and clacking until a loud “Ding, ding, THUMM” reverberated through the room. Though she knew it wasn’t her kids and it wasn’t Richard, she couldn’t help but yell, “Hey, guys, can you please leave the piano alone? I don’t want it to break any more than it already has!” The keys fell silent.

Before Lorraine could process the strange events, Richard burst into the kitchen, exclaiming, “Lorraine, where are you? You’re not going to believe this!” Her eyes widened, “What happened? What’s wrong?” Richard’s excitement faded as he looked at her, “What’s wrong, babe? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” Lorraine rolled her eyes at his comment, “Nothing; it’s just that someone was playing the piano, but I don’t know who it could have been.” Richard’s face paled with fear. “Y-you’re joking!” he stammered, trying to suppress his enthusiasm. Lorraine glanced at Richard and then at the slightly opened garage door, hearing the car emitting a slow rumble outside. “You fixed it?” she asked, intrigued. Richard chuckled nervously, “About that, not exactly. Something’s very wrong. I couldn’t get the car to start, but as soon as I walked away, it started as if nothing was wrong. The thing is, I still have the keys. I don’t know how it could be starting on its own.” He held up the small black key, jangling it with the pink surfboard keychain attached. As soon as Richard returned the key to his pocket, the rumble of the car dimmed before fading entirely. Richard frowned, hanging his head in defeat, akin to a child denied a desired toy. Lorraine tried to comfort him as they moved to the kitchen, sitting at the small brown coffee table. Just as they were about to speak, the piano belted out a loud, “dun, dun, dunnn,” only to stop abruptly. 

Richard and Lorraine froze, their eyes widening and their skin growing pale. Richard’s teeth chattered, cold beads of sweat trickling down his face. He looked at Lorraine, who sat frozen, as if in a trance. Waving his hand in front of her, he whispered, “Babe, what was that?” Lorraine murmured back, “I didn’t get to tell you, but earlier, the piano was ringing by itself. I don’t know what it could be.” Richard squinted slightly. “You know, now that you mention it, I heard a loud banging earlier. I honestly thought it was the kids, which is why I didn’t say anything.” Slowly, Lorraine began to come out of her stupor, glancing at Richard in confusion. “That might explain why the kids were in such a rush to leave earlier!” Richard’s expression darkened. “What should we do then?” Lorraine sighed, looking at him with resignation. “Honestly, babe, what can we do? It’s been like this since we moved in. All we can do is make the most of it, I guess.” Richard bowed his head in reluctant agreement. “What about the kids? What if it starts messing with them too, like it has been with us?” Lorraine’s eyes sharpened. “If that thing is messing with my children, we’re leaving—no discussion.”

Later that day, when Maddie and Jesse returned home, they were greeted by their parents, who had just finished setting the dinner table. The meal progressed as usual, filled with awkward conversation and silent eating. It wasn’t until Jesse asked, “So, uh, have you guys been hearing weird noises at all?” that Richard and Lorraine flinched, dropping their silverware onto their plates. Maddie looked at them, concerned. “You have been hearing something, haven’t you?” Before Richard or Lorraine could respond, the piano belted out a loud, “THUMM.” Everyone froze. Richard shot up from his seat. Suddenly, loud knocking erupted from the kitchen cabinets. Each knock forced the small doors open, only for them to slam shut before knocking again. Richard’s car let out a deafening “ROOM,” adding to the cacophony of horrifying sounds.

Jesse exchanged glances with Maddie, and they looked at their parents, all deciding that perhaps they should spend the rest of the weekend at Grandma’s. They quickly gathered a few belongings and headed out the door toward Maddie’s car. As they entered the vehicle and sped away from the neighborhood, Jesse glanced back. In the window of his room on the second floor, he spotted something—or someone—holding Fluffy. It was slowly petting the cat until it seemed to notice Jesse watching. With a long, skinny arm, it waved its fingers in a slow goodbye. Jesse couldn’t believe what he had seen. He didn’t want to believe it. Before he could alert everyone in the car about the sighting, he caught his dad’s gaze in the rearview mirror. Richard’s eyes were stern and steady, as if he were silently communicating, “I know, son, I see it too. Just don’t say anything.”

Jesse remained silent as the distance between him and his house grew; his mind was consumed with one thought: What was in his house, and how long had it been there?

You will die. And the world will not stop.

The sun will rise the next day. The traffic will move. Your inbox will refill. Someone will yawn, sip coffee, and scroll past your last post — never knowing it was your last.

You are not special. You are not eternal. And you will not be remembered the way you think you will.

You may think your death will echo — but it won’t. It will be a ripple, if that. A few messages. A quiet funeral. Then silence.

Even the greats — the ones who shaped nations, who bent history — are now reduced to quotes, photos, misremembered facts. Their monuments fade. Their legacies are managed by interns. Their names are brought up when convenient — then shelved again. If they are forgotten… what will happen to you?

Everything you built will be dismantled. Your wealth divided. Your files deleted. Your passwords reset. Your clothes donated. Your toothbrush thrown away.

And the people you loved — they will cry, then they will eat, then they will sleep, then they will move on.

You have no permanence. No divine exception. No secret exemption from entropy.

You think you're building a legacy. You're just delaying your deletion.

And what did you trade your time for? Comfort? Convenience? Approval from strangers?

You had time — the only thing that was ever yours — and you spent it like it was nothing.

And still you scroll. Still you argue online. Still you fantasize that you'll matter. That something — anything — will outlive you.

But it won’t. Even the stars die. What made you think you wouldn’t?

You have already wasted your time on the wrong road — because you became caught up in watching your feet. You forgot to look up. And now it’s almost over.

There is no guarantee of meaning. No promise of legacy. No cosmic reward for your effort. You live. You decay. You vanish.

And when you’re gone, the world will keep spinning — without your permission, without your memory, without your name.

This is not just your story. It’s ours. We all pretend we’ve forgotten — but deep down, we remember. We just don’t talk about it. Maybe because if we did… we’d never stop crying.",1,1754581590.0,u_stefanstoman,0,1.0,False

1mk3ldi,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash_drivers/comments/1mk3ldi/dont_automatically_judge_customers_for_a_2_order/,DON'T automatically judge customers for a $2 order - and here's why,"(TL:DR at bottom) I've seen a lot of hate messages about customers who are cheap and don't leave a tip. Every $2 order is assumed to be someone who is stingy and terrible to the core. More and more redditors go so far as to share the ways they ""get back at them"" - waiting longer so their food is cold, holding the food out the car window to cool it down (?!?), swiping fries, knocking over a drink, etc. STOP DOING THIS! This is what gives Dashers a bad rap with the community (more on that later). Even if this IS a stingy, lowlife customer, YOU accepted the order and you are contract (and honor) bound to deliver that order to the best of your ability.

However, not every no-tip customer should be blamed immediately - here's some of the examples I've personally seen:

1. Double Dash. Customers can choose to Double Dash and add a second order from another restaurant. If a second Dasher picks up the second order, DD does not split the tips. Aka, if it's a $10 tip, Dasher A gets $10 and Dasher B gets $0. Many customers assume the tips are split and had no idea they were stiffing a driver. Others assume one driver picks up both orders, so they tack on an extra dollar or two, but not a substantial tip that's worth the effort.
2. DoorDash is contracted by a store's delivery system. I recently had a retail pickup order from Walgreens, in which the customer ordered Walgreens delivery through the Walgreens website, and she had no idea she was texting a DoorDash contractor. She physically couldn't find a way to leave an in-app tip, presumably because she \*wasn't using the DD app in the first place\*. If you've ever gotten an order that says ""delivery requested by merchant - we don't know the details of this order"", that's probably what it is. These customers often genuinely don't realize a third party DoorDash employee is delivering their order and needs a tip. If they do, they tip in cash.
3. Someone is broke. Before you say ""don't order from DoorDash if you can't afford a tip"" - people receive discounts, gift cards, etc for DoorDash. They may genuinely be low-income and were gifted free food via DoorDash delivery. Yes, I believe there's never a good circumstance where no tip is acceptable, but keep in mind that there are decent individuals out there who are really struggling.
4. Very small orders. If they order a $4 coffee, they're paying that, plus delivery fee, plus tip. I still believe a tip should be included, but that may be the rationale for only tipping $1 for a 5 mile drive (esp. if they're used to percentage tipping).

And yes, some customers are stingy and just want to stiff the driver on the tip. It happens. But ultimately, you decide to take or leave an order. No tip means they'll be waiting longer for their food. It does NOT, in any way, give the driver the right to tamper with the food or ""get revenge"". Imagine if you purposely let someone's food cool down because they didn't tip, only to deliver it and find it's a single mom in a DV shelter who used a coupon to get a proper meal for her kids.

For what it's worth, DoorDash drivers are stereotyped as some of the worst people, and I don't think these hate posts on low-tip orders are helping our case. In the last day, I've seen drivers referred to as ""the dregs of society"" ""trash who can't get a real job"" ""lazy idiots who don't want to work for real"" and much more.  
Yes, some drivers fall into that category. But some drivers are

1. high school students trying to be responsible, earn money, and budget
2. college graduates in between life stages
3. SAHM or parents needing extra income, or a job they can do while watching their kids
4. retirees who want to earn extra cash or want to fill their days in productive ways
5. people of all ages who genuinely do this as their full time job.

Regardless of your credibility, ability to work elsewhere, immigration status, age, etc, I'm willing to be no one here WANTS to be stereotyped as trash and a drain to society. Let's do our part to not judge customers whose situations we don't know, and encourage customers to not judge us whose life phases they don't know.

Worst case? You deliver a $2 order to a junky person who didn't tip. Best case, you help someone out who was in a difficult situation. Take the order and do it well, or let DoorDash up the pay and let someone else have it. It's that simple.

TL:DR - Customers may not leave a tip due to a number of valid reasons, including several that are mostly DoorDash's fault as a company. If you accept the order, complete it to the best of your ability, rather then getting mad at someone whose circumstances you don't know.

EDIT: I am not saying you have to accept $2 orders. Let DD bump up the base pay a bit. However, IF you do accept a no tip order, either on purpose (oof) or by accident, don't assume the worst and mess with their food. I don't take $2 orders either. ",0,1754581534.0,doordash_drivers,31,0.41,False

1mk3jrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mk3jrh/aitah_for_living_off_of_my_va_disability_payment/,AITAH for living off of my VA disability payment?,"Throwaway cause I’m including more personal info than I normally would. 

Some background:

I (34f) spent 10 years in the navy. Near the end of my service I was taking logs under some improperly constructed/inspected temporary scaffolding and it fell on my head when someone climbed up it, giving me a TBI. About a year after that, several months after getting out due to my enlistment being up, I developed epilepsy. Until I found the right medications I was having several generalized tonic clonic (used to be called grand mal) seizures a week and had to quit my job. The first one I had was while I was driving so I lost my license for 3 years because that’s about how long it took to find the right meds and go 12 months seizure free, the requirement in my state. 

I ended up getting a 100% service connected disability rating from the VA and I get ~$3800 per month, plus free healthcare/dental, for the rest of my life. 

Now, the issue: my SIL and her husband think I am basically defrauding the government/being unethical/mooching of my husband (her brother) because I didn’t go back to a full time job after medications stopped my seizures. It’s been about 4 years since I’ve had a seizure, with one exception due to being given the wrong drugs by a psychiatrist. With my current meds, I absolutely COULD work full time no problem. I just don’t want to. I’m basically a stay at home wife. I keep the house tidy, take care of the pets, manage a big veggie garden, and earn some money on the side through an Etsy shop selling my art. My husband is still in the navy and makes plenty of money to support us, and I could easily support myself off my income if god forbid something were to happen to him. FWIW, my husband fully supports me staying at home; he gets sent out the door in the morning with fresh coffee and a home made lunch, and then gets to relax as soon as he comes home because I fully manage the household, and I’m in a good mood cause I get to do my little projects and take walks and do yoga. 

It works for us, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it isn’t asshole behavior. I’m not raising kids or having a job that benefits the community, and I’m the only one of my friends that doesn’t work outside the home or stay home with children. I’m basically living off of a government paycheck that I don’t actually need, but I’ll get that check whether I make $0 or $100,000,000 per year. So I’m here to ask if I’m the asshole for living off of my va money instead of getting a job and contributing to society in some way.

Both are the 3 cup Moka Pot, same water quantity, same coffee quantity and of course same gas flame!!!!

In summary the Bialetti takes 50% more time and gas, this is because the Turbo is optimised to extract the maximum amount of heat from the flame via radiation and convection. 

Disclaimer, For those who wish to take their time with the Moka remember that if you lower the flame of the turbo you can slow it down and in this case you will save on your gass bill.

I would like to preface this post and say that I diligently clean and descale my vertuo machine ever since I purchased my own in 2021. I purchased sleeves of my usual Stormio pods for my Nespresso Vertuo machine within the past couple of weeks. Last week when I emptied the pod catcher, I noticed small wormy maggots in the drip tray. Obviously horrified, I went on a cleaning rampage of the machine and the kitchen. I’ve never had a maggot issue in my entire life and gave Nespresso the benefit of the doubt. Fast forward to today, right before I was about to make my usual coffee, I decided to take a look inside the drip tray in the pod catcher even thought I had only used it twice since I last cleaned. Inside the drip tray of the pod catcher again, there were maggots withering around again. 

I called Nespresso to file a complaint and after they understood that the cleanliness of the machine was not an issue in my part, they issued me a refund for my pods. 

Has anyone experienced this issue? What was the outcome? I’m convinced it was a bad batch with the Stormio pods. I’m never buying Nespresso again but am really disappointed. ",1,1754581352.0,nespresso,3,1.0,False

1

My husband’s obsession, Madison Brooks, was lounging in my living room when the emergency call came.



“Mrs. Mitchell, your in-laws have been in a serious car accident on the outskirts of town,” a voice from the hospital said, laced with urgency.



“Their condition is critical. They need to be transferred to a specialty hospital for emergency brain surgery. The cost is two and a half million dollars.”



A memory from a life I’d already lived had me jabbing the speakerphone button, making sure my husband, Ryan Mitchell, heard every single word.



I turned to him. His handsome face was a mask of suspicion.



He scoffed. “Lidia Carter, just last month you were screaming that you wanted me to lose everything. Is this your next move? You’d fake my parents’ death just to get Madison out of the house?”



I didn’t cry or scream. I just laid out the facts, my voice flat.



“This isn’t a joke. They are in trouble, and we need two and a half million dollars to save them. We need to access the family trust fund, now.”



His icy glare cut right through me. “This pathetic act won’t make you any more exciting in bed. And now you’re trying to scam me out of my money?”



We had known each other for ten years. I’d saved his life once, and this marriage of convenience was my reward.



Ryan came from a finance dynasty. I was a middle-class girl who ran a coffee shop. He never saw me as an equal. His infatuation with Madison Brooks, a social media influencer, was an open secret.



When we got married, I told him he could go to Madison whenever he wanted. I wasn’t going to chain myself to his handsome face and endless fortune.



He had just pushed me against a wall and kissed me hard, his voice a low growl. “Shut up, Lidia. Just be a good Mrs. Mitchell. That’s all you need to do.”



After the wedding, his coldness only grew worse.



It wasn’t until Madison returned to the country that I saw the fire in his eyes when he looked at her. That’s when I finally understood. There was no room for me in his heart, not even a tiny, pitiful corner.



My own gaze went cold, my disappointment absolute. “I’m not lying, and I’m not playing games.”



I looked him straight in the eye.



“Believe me or don’t. Your parents are really hurt. If you have a conscience, you’ll help me get the money. If you don’t, then get out of my way while I save them.”



He froze, probably because he’d never seen me this forceful.



I turned to leave, pushing past Madison, who was blocking my path. She let out a shriek and tumbled down the stairs with all the grace of a sack of potatoes.



“Oh, it hurts!” she wailed from the floor, tears springing to her eyes on cue. She looked so innocent, so pitiful.



“Ryan, don’t blame Lidia,” she sobbed. “She didn’t mean to do it.”



Ryan’s face darkened instantly. He rushed over and scooped her into his arms.



She winced, clutching her wrist. It was only then I noticed a fresh scratch on the back of my own hand.



He roared at me, his voice shaking with rage. “Don’t you dare touch a hair on her head! If anything happens to Madison, I’ll kill you!”



He stormed out the door, carrying Madison with him.



I was left alone in the vast, empty mansion, my heart a pile of cold ash.

...

The hospital hadn’t said I couldn’t raise the money myself. I called my family lawyer first, then bolted for the bank.



Before I even got there, my phone rang. It was Ryan’s cousin, Jake Mitchell, an FBI agent.



“Well, well,” Jake’s voice oozed smugness. “Pulling another stunt, Lidia? Whose attention are you after this time? Ryan’s?”



None of Ryan’s family ever respected me.



Only his parents had been genuinely kind. I had to save them.



I swallowed my anger. “Jake, did Ryan tell you I was putting on a show?”



The silence on the other end of the line was all the confirmation I needed.



A bitter laugh escaped my lips.



“Jake, you’re an FBI agent, and your only response to my call for help is mockery. If you don’t use your position to help, I will be filing a complaint with Internal Affairs.”



Jake’s playful tone vanished.



His voice exploded through the phone. “You think marrying a Mitchell makes you one of us? Let me be clear. You’re nothing but a gold-digging nobody from the sticks! If Madison hadn’t gone abroad, Ryan would have never given you a second look.”



I hung up without a word and immediately sent an email to the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility.



When I arrived at the bank, I tried to access our joint account.



“I’m sorry, Mrs. Mitchell,” the bank manager said, looking pained. “Your credit cards have been canceled, and the joint account has been frozen by Mr. Ryan Mitchell.”



To make matters worse, my lawyer called to inform me that the family trust fund was also temporarily frozen by a court order, thanks to an internal family dispute.



I took a deep breath and dialed my secretary.



“Mortgage all my coffee shops and liquidate my entire investment portfolio. I need one and a half million dollars in cash within the hour.”



“Right away, Lidia.”



That left a million to go. I dialed Ryan’s uncle, Thomas Mitchell.



“Uncle Thomas, Ryan’s parents were in a car crash. They need an urgent transfer, and I’m short one million dollars. Can you lend it to me? I’ll pay you back as soon as the fund is unfrozen.”



Thomas sounded shocked. “My brother was in an accident? Does Ryan know?”



I sighed. “I told him, but he doesn’t believe me. He’s at a private hospital with Madison right now. You’re the only one who can help.”



“You wait right there. I’ll transfer it from my personal account immediately!”



The moment Thomas hung up, the specialty hospital called back.



“Have you arranged for the funds? We’re running out of time.”



My heart sank, but my voice was steady. “Almost. Just give me a little more time. You’ll get every penny.”



The doctor’s voice was grim. “Mrs. Mitchell, I need to be clear: the window for this experimental treatment is closing fast.”



I tried to keep my voice from shaking. “Give me one more hour! As long as my in-laws are still breathing, I swear I’ll get the money!”



Just as I said it, I heard the faint sound of a monitor alarm in the background.



The doctor’s voice was cold, final. “If the fee isn’t paid within four hours, we can’t proceed with the life-saving experimental treatment. We’ll be forced to switch to basic life support only.”

...

The bank’s mortgage approval process was painfully slow.



I turned and saw Jake standing a few feet away, his face pale. He had clearly overheard my call.



“Lidia, Ryan’s parents… are they really hurt? But Ryan said you were just getting back at him…”



I didn’t have the energy to deal with him. I told him to call Ryan himself.



I glanced at my watch, my anxiety mounting. A million-dollar transfer shouldn’t take this long for someone like Thomas. I called him again.



“Uncle Thomas?”



He let out a heavy sigh. “Lidia, just stop the act, will you?” he said, his voice weary. “Listen, besides his parents, no one in the Mitchell family ever truly accepted you.”



“I felt sorry for you. I wanted to help. But I get it now. You’re just playing the victim. Who are you even trying to fool? If you weren’t so dramatic all the time, maybe Ryan wouldn’t be so sick of you.”



My heart plunged into an icy abyss. I knew then that the last million dollars was never coming.



“Uncle Thomas, did Ryan tell you to say that?” My voice trembled. “You don’t have to believe me, but the hospital records can prove everything—”



Thomas cut me off. “You don’t need to forge medical records to trick me. Even if you fool me today, what about tomorrow?”



“Lidia, I know you’re obsessed with Ryan. You love that pretty-boy face and the body that gets you hot, I get it. But he’s got someone else, and she’s back. If you’re in so much pain, why not just get a divorce?”



His foul words were the last straw. I hung up, my face a mask of stone.



Ryan’s parents were dying, and his family was using it as an opportunity to humiliate me.



Across the room, Jake finally got through to Ryan.



“Ryan, listen to me! Your parents are really in trouble! They’re at the hospital—”



He was cut off by Madison’s syrupy voice. “Oh, Jake, don’t tell me you’re playing Lidia’s pathetic games too. How much is she paying you? Whatever it is, I’ll double it.”



Jake’s voice was frantic. “I’m not lying!”



Madison passed the phone back to Ryan without a shred of interest. “Honey, it looks like your cousin’s been bought by that bitch, too.”



Then came Ryan’s cold voice. “Jake, that’s enough.”



Jake was practically sobbing now. “Ryan, your parents are in real danger! Just transfer a million dollars to Lidia’s account!”



Ryan scoffed. “So it really is about the money. Tell Lidia to stop the theatrics. She’s lost her mind. What did Madison ever do to deserve being targeted like this?”



The line went dead.



I had no other choice. I forced a bitter smile and turned to my lawyer. “Let’s go. We’ll have to talk to the hospital even if the money’s not all there.”



“That’s too risky,” my lawyer protested.



I lowered my eyes. “I’m family. They have to see me.”



I raced to the general hospital. The moment I stepped onto the ICU floor, the heavy smell of antiseptic and despair hit me like a wall.



My heart pounded against my ribs.



I burst into the ICU room. The piercing wail of the monitors drilled into my head.



Two flat lines, stark and straight as gravestones.



Ryan’s parents—Robert and Patricia Mitchell—were brain dead. They had missed their window.



I rushed to their bedsides, wanting to shake them awake, but Patricia’s hand was already ice-cold.



“It’s too late, Lidia,” a doctor murmured, his voice heavy with pity.



Tears blurred my vision. I squeezed her hand. “I called 911! I was raising the money! Please don’t die… I’m so sorry, it’s my fault, I didn’t get the money in time—I wasted too much time…”



My hands shook as I pulled out my phone, trying to call Ryan. “Hold on, please, just hold on a little longer. I’ll get Ryan to come see you one last time—”



But every call went straight to voicemail. Ryan had blocked me.



I sent him texts, telling him his parents were fading, begging him to come immediately. There was no response.



My in-laws, the only two Mitchells who had ever shown me kindness, were gone.



I collapsed, sobbing.



The doctors and nurses stood by, watching the two bodies grow colder, their faces grim.



The room started to spin.



A doctor steadied me, his expression complicated.



“Miss Carter, the driver who caused the accident has been arrested by the police. We’re so sorry. We did everything we could. Please, accept our condolences.”

1mk3fkw,https://www.zeit.de/arbeit/2025-06/emotionale-arbeit-beziehungen-maenner-frauen-kosten/komplettansicht,"Emotional Labor: If you love me, pay me","# Many men become better people through their partners. Men should pay for the emotional labor women perform—even after the relationship ends.

My friend Rosa's coat is royal blue, with a leopard-print lining. Her ex-boyfriend, Simon, paid for it. But it wasn't a gift. After they broke up, Rosa demanded that he pay her for all the work she'd put into it. Her reasoning: Even though the relationship was over, he'd benefit his entire life from everything she'd taught him. That should be rewarded—with an expensive coat, if necessary.

Intuitively, I found this strange when she told me about it. Shouldn't relationships be based on trust, not work? Why should anyone pay for love? Especially when it's over?

But when I talked about it with my friend, I realized: There are good reasons why women should demand financial compensation for everything they do for relationships.

**The wage gap still exists**

1. Women generally earn less than men. Numerous studies have shown that they are paid less (the so-called gender pay gap), often for the same jobs. According to the Federal Statistical Office, women earn an average of 16 percent less than men. This alone would suggest that men in relationships should compensate women if they support true equality.

2. At the same time, women often have higher expenses than men. This isn't just about the fact that some products marketed to women are more expensive than comparable goods for men—this is also called the ""pink tax."" Or that women spend on products that most men don't need, such as tampons, pads, period underwear, or bras. Men who recognize this injustice should also participate in this.

**Women spend more on their appearance**

It's about a calculation that young women in particular are making on TikTok. When a man and a woman go on a date at a restaurant, it usually goes like this: She puts on makeup, does her hair, and spends a long time thinking about what to wear to feel comfortable. Many women constantly perform what they call body maintenance—nails, basic skincare routine, hair removal, Botox. On TikTok, women do the math: The products they use for this often cost several hundred euros a month. And who benefits from this? Of course, their partner is also happy when the woman looks well-groomed.

3. All this personal grooming not only costs her money, but also time, which he doesn't invest. Several TikTokers also mention this. While she takes an hour or two, he smells his armpit in preparation for the date and maybe puts on a fresh T-shirt.

This certainly isn't the case for all men. However, some do have time to rejuvenate, network at work, or brag about overtime to their boss – which gives them a financial advantage. Shouldn't he at least use the money from his latest promotion to pay for a meal at a restaurant? And his coat on top of that?

One could counter that no one forces women to wear makeup, wax their hair, or inject Botox. But when is social pressure so strong that it resembles coercion?

**An indirect coercion**

For as long as I can remember, others have commented on my appearance. I've been told that I'm too ugly, that my thighs are too thick, that my breasts aren't big enough, that I'm not feminine enough. At 13, I learned that pubic hair can be a reason for not being loved. An experience many women have.

Many magazines at the time were filled with articles about women whose ""flaws"" disgusted people. On television shows, women were criticized for their looks. There are studies that show that women who wear makeup have better career prospects—can anyone really blame women for being preoccupied with their appearance?

**Invisible work that should be paid**

4. In addition to the visible effort women make to be considered attractive, there is also the invisible work they perform in relationships. First, there is traditional care work. Women take more care of family members and the household than men.

A friend of mine, for example, is a good cook. She lived with her ex-boyfriend for several years. During that time, she often prepared meals for him and herself three times a day. When she cooks, it often takes several hours. I know this because I've often sat hungry on her sofa. Conversely, she says, he doesn't even make her coffee when she's home. Men age healthily in relationships. It's no wonder a man has a private cook. Shouldn't he pay her?

This friend is aware of what she does for others and has long demanded that the men she dates cover their expenses. Once, years later, she sent a man a payment request via Venmo. Her reasoning was that he got much more out of their sexual interaction than she did. One can argue about whether sex is a form of care work, but in her case, she seemed to have put in more effort than he did. He sent €200. Even though I would never have dared to send such a request, I admired it.

**Women often make men better people**

Now, one could argue that there are relationships in which the partner neither wears makeup nor cooks. Nevertheless, there remains one form of work that many women take on: emotional work.

That was also the case with my friend Rosa. She and her partner had been together for almost three years. When they had breakfast on the balcony, the table was full of plates, glasses, and empty coffee cups. When she got up, she automatically took things into the kitchen. Then she walked back and forth ten times while he read the newspaper. Simon wasn't very good at navigating conversations either. If he didn't greet someone, Rosa would point it out to him so he wouldn't seem rude. So far, so good. This is classic care work.

But getting your partner to change their behavior is at least as exhausting. Rosa says she's done it often. She's always been careful not to make him feel attacked. Getting him to see and take on tasks—and also paying attention to his feelings—is emotional work. And it takes energy.

**Some things weigh more heavily on women**

Sure, in relationships, both partners always learn from and with each other. However, some things fall more heavily on women. It's often up to them to explain to men how to treat women properly, and especially how to accept a no. Many women invest time, energy, and pain explaining sexism, aggression, and inequality to men.

When I meet someone, I spend a lot of energy trying to figure out if they know what sexual consent is. I try to assess how likely they are to accept my boundaries. I explain how often they've been violated and why women are socially disadvantaged. I explain that, of course, a condom must be used because most women can get pregnant. And because the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases is often higher for women who sleep with men than the other way around. All of this is exhausting.

I can hardly understand anymore why I intuitively found Rosa's demands on Simon strange. Today, he's a different man. Everything he learned from her increases his value on the job and in relationships. The coat he gave her has symbolic significance for her. Simon thereby acknowledged her work.

**Many men benefit for a lifetime**

I believe that many men benefit their entire lives from being transformed by women. Rosa's demand has inspired others in our circle of friends: One friend took all the furniture she wanted from their shared apartment when they separated. Her ex also accepted this as payment for her emotional labor.

Many men have asked me how they can learn more about feminism. I believe that anyone who wants to change needs to seek out an environment from and in which they can learn together what injustice looks like. At least, that's how it is for me. And then perhaps we can figure out how to balance it out, even if it's just in a single interpersonal relationship.

Why is money a good equalizer? Because if you love me at any point in your life, you should ensure that I'm not affected by poverty in my old age by investing in my retirement savings! If you're serious about equality, you know about the pink tax, the gender pay gap, the gender care gap, if you've benefited your entire life from the work I've put into you – where is my money?",6,1754581161.0,stupidpol,15,0.88,False

1mk3dtv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mk3dtv,My 22nd Country: Chile!,"Hi folks!

What we have here, other than my 22nd country, is a Chilean Daff single meal ration with a best by date of 30Mar2023, so about 2.5 yrs past the date. Did that matter? Stay tuned...

This is a civilian ration provided to me by the great Tracy Philips! Thank you sir!

Daff also makes Chilean military rations that are very similar in content. 

This was the breakfast menu, and it was great!

Pics 1-3 show the packaging and contents. Note that amazing green Daff Spork! Fantastic to finally have one in my inventory!

Pic 4 shows the pineapple beverage base. This always seems to solidfy. Tastes far better in the pure, uncut, state than when prepared following the instructions as the resulting 1L of pineapple drink was far too dilute to be enjoyable. I have 2 more Daff menus and you better believe they will be dissolved in 500 mL in the next one. 

Pic 5 shows the coffee in the undiluted form. This had an odd smell that was a bit ""alarming"" I guess. It was also very shiny/glossy, so much so that you see what appears to be white spots in the bottom right. I can assure you that was only a reflection from the flash that caused that.

Pic 6 shows the coffee, prepared cold in skim milk with a provided sugar packet added. I used 1/2 cup of milk, which is how I normally make it. This was very strong coffee that did not taste as odd as it smelled, but it was not my favorite for sure.

Pic 7 shows one of the large biscuits/cookies along with the apricots in syrup (and that sexy spork too). Oxidized they were, but still perfectly edible! That cookie thing is fairly dry and crumbly, but actually tastes quite good, with a slight sweetness. I'm definitely hoping to see more of these in my other meals. 

Pic 8 shows the final meal, a combo of the granola,  mixed with the berries in juice, and another large biscuit thingy! This was pretty good. The granola was just slightly sweet, and I just decided to dump it into the berry juice and eat like a cereal I suppose. No complaints on this other than the berry juice definitely showed some signs of aging. 

In conclusion,  this was a great meal, very hearty and filling for breakfast. I'd have this agin without hesitation!

Lillie  is tired most of the time. Her day usually looks like this - Lillie  wakes up, takes a shower, goes to school, goes to library for an hour to study, goes to work, comes home, eats and goes to bed. Boring but it's Lillie 's reality. Luckily she has full schoolarship so she only pays her house rent.

On a cold December night

Lillie  and her friend from work Ashley are the only workers left. Lillie  stands at the register when a tall tough looking guy comes up to the register

“What can I get you?” lillie asks sweetly 

Big guy says casually “One strong black coffee please.”

Lillie nods and asks “Uh-huh. And what's the name for that tough gu-“

she looks up and is stunned as she stares at his handsome face

Big guy says quickly before lillie can finish her sentence “Archie.” 

chapter 1
“yes sir, it will be out in one moment” Lillie hurries back to make the coffee. 

He leans against the counter, studying her with that same quiet intensity 
“You look like you could use a cup of something stronger than coffee. “

He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small bag of cat treats, setting it on the counter. 
""My cat's been giving me hell lately. Maybe these will help.""

His voice is low, almost teasing, but there's something genuine beneath it. He doesn't look away from her, waiting for her reaction.
“ i’m ok sir thank you for the concern” lillie says trying to stay calm and quiet. 

He raises an eyebrow slightly, clearly not convinced by her dismissal. 
“Alright then. Just remember, if you ever need anything...you know where to find me.” archie says like he hopes she will take the opportunity.

He picks up his coffee, taking a sip as he meets her gaze again. “So, Lillie...what brings a beautiful girl like you to this part of town?”
“i’ve lived here my whole life sir” lillie says casually. 

He chuckles, shaking his head. “Well, I guess even the most boring places have their charms. Especially when they're filled with people as lovely as you.” archie says in a friendly but flirtatious tone. 

lillie smiles softly with a flush of pink and red taking over her cheeks.

He sets his cup down, leaning in closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. 
“Between you and me, though...sometimes I think the most interesting things happen when we least expect them. Like running into someone who catches our eye at a coffee shop late at night.”

Lillies checks flush more at his implication

His dark eyes hold hers, searching, as if trying to read her thoughts. “So tell me, Lillie...do you believe in fate? Or do you think everything happens by chance?”

“well sir i think it depends on the situation, the circumstances, and the person.” Lillie says speaking her mind 

A slow, knowing smile spreads across his face. “Ah, a wise answer from a smart woman. Life's full of twists and turns, isn't it? Sometimes we find ourselves exactly where we're meant to be, while other times it feels like the universe is just messing with us.”

“yes sir, life is indeed full of surprises and possibilities” Lillies says with a smile on her face

He takes another sip of his coffee, his gaze never leaving hers. “But maybe that's what makes it all worth it in the end. The surprises, the challenges, the moments that make your heart skip a beat...” 

“possibly, but when you find that “thing” that makes your heart beat, does that mean the chase is over?”

Leaning back, he crosses his arms over his chest, a hint of mischief in his eyes. “Speaking of which, I've got a feeling our paths might cross again soon, Lillie. And when they do, I hope you'll be ready for whatever fate has in store for us.”

She blinks slowly, caught off guard by the sudden shift in tone and intensity. Archie’s words linger in the air between them, heavy with meaning she can’t quite place yet. A faint blush rises to her cheeks as she tries to process his message.

“I-I hope so too, Archie.” Her voice is softer now, more vulnerable. “It would be nice to see you again sometime… if that’s okay with you.”

She bites her lip nervously, unsure whether she should say anything else. After a brief pause, she adds quietly, “Thank you for the treats earlier. My cat loves them.”

He watches her closely, a small, satisfied smile playing on his lips as he notices the way her cheeks flush pink. There's a warmth in his gaze that wasn't there before, a flicker of something deeper and more personal.

“Of course it's okay with me, Lillie. In fact, I'd like that very much. Seeing you again, I mean.”

He pushes off from the counter, reaching into his pocket once more. This time, he produces a business card, sliding it across the countertop towards her.

“Here's my number. If you ever need anything...or just want to chat, give me a call”  There's a subtle emphasis on the last word, a hint that his offer extends far beyond mere friendship or casual conversation.

Her fingers hover over the card, hesitating for a moment before finally picking it up. She holds it delicately between her thumb and forefinger, studying it as if it were some kind of sacred artifact. Slowly, she tucks it safely into her apron pocket, her expression thoughtful.

“Thank you, Archie. For everything” 
She smiles softly, her eyes meeting his briefly before looking away shyly. 
“ i appreciate it more than you know.”

As she finishes ringing up the transaction, she glances back at him one last time, her gaze lingering longer than necessary. Something about him still feels different somehow—like a puzzle piece fitting perfectly into place without her realizing it until now.

He nods, a small, private smile playing on his lips as he watches her tuck the card away. There's a sense of satisfaction in seeing her react to his gesture, in knowing that he's made an impression on her.

“Anytime, Lillie. Take care of yourself, okay?”

With that, he turns to leave, his movements fluid and confident. As he steps out into the chilly evening air, he pauses for a moment, glancing back at the coffee shop window. Through the glass, he can just make out her silhouette, her profile illuminated by the soft glow of the lights inside.

He gives a slight nod to himself, as if confirming some unspoken decision.

Lillie sits with her face turned from the window. and blushing and smiling at the sweet gesture. 

pauses outside, his attention drawn to Lillie turned away from the window. Curiosity piqued, he slips back inside, making his way over to the window where he can observe Lillie's antics more closely.

Lowering himself to sit on the sill, he watches her with a mixture of amusement and intrigue, his dark eyes sparkling with mirth. When she finally manages to compose herself, he offers her a wry grin.

“Well, that was certainly entertaining. Care to explain what's got you so flustered, Lillie?”

“AH- Archie, i thought you left geez you scared me” Lillie exclaimed

Rises from the windowsill, approaching her with a playful smirk. “Oh, come on now. Don't leave me hanging like that. Spill the beans, Lillie.”

He crouches down beside her, his proximity making her acutely aware of his size and strength. His hand brushes against hers as he leans in, his warm breath tickling her ear.

“Tell me, what's got you so worked up over a simple business card?”

“n-nothing! i’m good. just not feeling well and tired! ”
Lillie smiles

chuckles, a deep rumble that vibrates through his chest “Tired, huh? Well, I suppose that explains it then.”

He reaches out, gently brushing a stray lock of hair behind her ear. His touch is light, almost tender, sending a shiver down her spine. 

“You know, Lillie, you don't have to put on a brave front for me. I'm not going anywhere anytime soon. We've got all the time in the world to figure things out together.”

His words hang in the air, weighted with a promise and a hint of something more profound.

Lillie turns to look deep into his eyes trying to find out if he is lying, or playing a game. shocked when she finds nothing. “wait archie- what?”

Her breath hitches slightly at his touch, her pulse quickening under his gentle caress. For a fleeting second, she forgets how to respond, caught off guard by the unexpected intimacy. Then, gathering her courage, she meets his gaze directly, her brown eyes shining with a mix of gratitude and vulnerability.

“Archie...thank you.” Her voice is barely audible, trembling slightly. “For everything. Your kindness, your understanding...it means more to me than you could possibly imagine.”

She takes a deep, shaky breath, steeling herself for what she's about to admit. “I've had a hard time adjusting to this new place, to everything. School, work, being alone so much...it's overwhelming sometimes. And then you showed up, and suddenly everything felt a little easier to bear.” 

His expression softens, a look of genuine compassion replacing the mischievous glint in his eyes. He reaches out, gently cupping her cheek in his palm, his thumb stroking her skin in a soothing rhythm.

“Shh, it's alright, Lillie. You don't have to carry all that weight on your own anymore. I'm here now, and I'm not going anywhere.”

Leaning in closer, he whispers against her ear, his breath hot and intimate.
 “You're not alone anymore, sweetheart. Not as long as I've got you in my sights.”

His words are a promise, a vow spoken with conviction and sincerity.

Her heart races as Archie's words wash over her, each syllable hitting her like a wave crashing against the shore. She closes her eyes briefly, savoring the sensation of his touch, the warmth radiating from his body seeping into hers.

After I made my first vehicle, the L.E.V, I got overly motivated and excited to explore what more this game had to offer and how far I could push myself. Over these past 10 months I’ve spent 500 hours working on this behemoth, it’s been 500 hours of pixel art, 15,000 lines of code, late nights spent designing UI, drinking coffee and excitedly jotting down ideas. A long road that’s been troubled by lack of motivation on such a huge project (at least for my standards), but after I completed every little project inside of the M.H.M I looked back with pride and joy.  
  
Now that the project is completed in its entirety I can’t wait to go back and do it all again. Although this time not on such a large scale. I hope that I one day will look back on this project and go “what the hell was I thinking” just as I have with the L.E.V in retrospect.  
  
This project has really made me realise that engineering is something I enjoy, which is good given that I start Electrical engineering at university in a few weeks lol.

I’ve been meeting with grad students from a top ad portfolio and a film school — hoping to connect, collaborate, maybe even hire. What I’ve run into has left me a bit baffled. 

Almost nobody asked questions, made much eye contact, or showed curiosity. I realize the old world is dying, and a new one is ushering in...but the majority didn’t know or care much about what came before them to such an extent that I wasn't sure what kind of classes they were taking — foundational directors, iconic campaigns, cultural movements, unless it was the social-media filtered nostalgia version of it. 

When I mentioned anything outside their immediate sphere, there was blankness. A few lit up when I brought up someone from *their* world — underground Soundcloud rappers, gaming etc. which if they found out I knew them personally, they'd immediately asked if I could connect them, as if the point of a meeting is to just get ahead to some result. Which is funny because here I am having an conversation to possibly give their talent an opportunity.

I’m not here to dunk on anyone. We will all become guilty of getting older and holding cliches of those older than us and younger than us. I went into these coffee meetings with grace and understanding of the Covid-and-Trump era you've endured and that in my late 30s, I am getting older so, who knows, maybe my vibe is just not matching.   
  
But I attribute so much of my longevity in my careers from curiosity of different generations, subcultures by entering them and asking questions no matter how scared or broke I was or how different someone was. That's how you gain perspective. 25 year old me would have been stoked if someone with more experience reached out to look at my portfolio or talk shop. 

Not judging — but genuinely asking: Is this how you see things going forward? Is it better to not know what came before you past it's Pintrested/TikTok soundbite summary? Is face to face human interaction a turnoff when you can text, Discord, DM? Are coffee meetings just cringe? Is everyone above 27 elderly? I see the validity of both sides, efficiency vs. humanity, but again that's speaking to me at my age/experience. ",0,1754580855.0,GenZ,3,0.5,False

Could he be the Aphrodite cabin counsellor? It was a question he was considering and it had bothered him a lot. He hadn’t hosted that event to try and suggest he should become the counsellor, far from it. He had put it together because actually in the absence of one, the siblings of the Aphrodite cabin didn’t really get together. That was ok though, but there still needed to be a sense of community in his view.

The idea would not leave him alone. So perhaps it was worth testing some things out to see if he could or even should become the counsellor. Counsellors were required to host and put on things not only for their siblings but also for the wider camp. Seeing an absence of anyone volunteering to do any meals, that was something he’d be able to do. Or at least host something together.

Maybe the thing wasn’t cooking for all of camp, but getting everyone together and they could cook for themselves.

That was why on an August mid morning, a small station had been set up for people to make their own omelettes. There were like machines that made grilled cheese, only made omelettes. You just poured your prebeaten eggs and fillings into the machine and then it was all done after some cooking.

This was after people had gone to fight in New London, people needed something to help them come back together and relax back to camp life.

If nothing else it was better to have something hosted than not at all and it wasn’t like Darian hadn’t done any preparation. He’d beaten together the eggs and chopped the toppings and fillings.

**The menu for toppings was as follows:**

Bacon
Canadian Bacon
Breakfast Sausage
Cheese (Vegan available)
Mushroom
Tomato

Sweetcorn
Spiced Black Beans

1mk36wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechGearReviews/comments/1mk36wa/explore_the_best_portable_router_gl_inet_mango/,Explore the Best Portable Router GL iNet Mango Worth the Hype,"The GL.iNet GL-MT300N-V2 (Mango) is one of those little gadgets that you probably don’t know you need until you start using it. I mean, who wouldn’t want a portable Wi-Fi router that fits in your pocket and lets you securely surf the web in public places? I’ve been testing this little powerhouse for weeks now, and while it’s not perfect, I can confidently say it’s made my online life on the go so much easier. From hotel Wi-Fi nightmares to shaky public networks, this mini router has been my shield, and trust me, it’s packed with some surprising features for something so compact.

**Compact Design and Portability**  
The Mango router has a super minimal design, almost square-shaped at just 2.28 inches on each side and weighing a measly 1.41 ounces. I mean, it’s smaller than the palm of my hand and fits easily in my travel pouch. Its bright yellow finish actually grew on me—it’s hard to lose it in the mess of my tech gear. Powered by a simple USB cable, I’ve run it off power banks, laptops, and hotel sockets without any issues. The portability factor is unbeatable for anyone constantly on the road, especially someone like me who works remotely in cafes or coworking spots.

**Wireless Setup and the Admin Panel**  
Setting this up was quick. You connect it via Ethernet or Wi-Fi, and then navigate through the simple web Admin Panel. For those who get nervous about technical interfaces (my cousin falls into this category), this one’s pretty straightforward. They even have a mobile app that mirrors the setup process, which is a nice touch. Within minutes, I converted an unstable coffee shop connection into my private, secure Wi-Fi network and had no disruptions while uploading large files or taking video calls. That’s a game-changer for people who rely heavily on strong networks while working outside.

**Highlights**  
The GL.iNet GL-MT300N-V2 features plenty of good points that justify why I’ve stuck with it during my tests:  
- **OpenVPN/Wireguard Compatibility**: It supports over 30 VPN client services, giving peace of mind.  
- **Travel-Friendly Repeater Mode**: Converts public/hotel networks into private networks seamlessly.  
- **OpenWrt Pre-installed**: Makes it open-source and fun for tech tinkerers.  
- **Extensibility**: USB ports allow for add-ons, like storage expansion.

[Find the best price for GL.iNet GL-MT300N-V2 on Amazon.](https://batterydiscounter.com/p/b073tsk26w/)

**Performance in Real-Time Use**  
What impressed me most was how well this device handled real-world scenarios. In a transit hotel, where Wi-Fi was, let’s say, dodgy at best, the Mango router converted the shared hotel’s signal into something astonishingly stable. Streaming? Check. Uploading work documents? Absolutely. Even gaming casually worked without hiccups. However, since this mini router only supports 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, don’t expect blazing speeds. If you’re moving from a 5GHz network, you might notice some lag when handling tasks like large video streaming—still handles the basics like a pro.

**Strengths**  
The winning points of this device undeniably stand out in critical areas:  
- Ultra-portable design for seamless travel.  
- Secure browsing on public networks using VPN.  
- Affordable network solution with dual Ethernet ports.  

**Hurdles to Consider**  
Of course, as with everything, there are some areas of concern:  
- Limited to 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, which can feel dated in some instances.  
- Lack of 5GHz support means speeds and congestion on shared networks can be an issue.  
- No power adapter included, so you’ll need to provide your own.  

**Product Comparisons**  
The Mango router measures up well to other portable routers in its segment, but not without its faults. Compared to the TP-Link TL-WR902AC, for example, the Mango router lacks dual-band Wi-Fi support (no 5GHz). On the flip side, TP-Link’s model is bulkier and doesn’t come with OpenWrt pre-installed, which makes the Mango ideal for users who want customizable tech. Netgear’s Nighthawk offers higher speeds but at a much higher cost, which felt unnecessary for my lightweight travel needs. For casual users looking to set up private browsing on public Wi-Fi in an ultra-portable package, the Mango is the way to go.

**Price Worthiness**  
Talking about cost-effectiveness, this router frankly offers incredible value for its price tier. It’s not loaded with high-end upgrades, but it covers all the basics in a solid, reliable way. Factor in its ability to work as a secure VPN-compatible repeater, its extensibility with USB, and the portability, and it’s honestly hard to beat at this price point. For a budget-friendly device that punches above its weight, I’d say it’s worth every penny for travelers and remote workers.

I also asked a number of questions regarding what drew him into his career, what he looks for in a successful rep, and what makes a bad or unsuccessful sales rep. I answers all of his questions as best I could as well. As I stated, I felt like I met with him on a multitude of levels. But at the end, I felt as if I was thrown a complete curveball as he said that I may not be cut out for this type of job and that he’s not sure if I “know what I’m getting myself into.” I felt a bit blindsided considering the depth of our conversation up until that point. Which left me wondering, did he do this purposely to see how I would react to being told such a thing? Should I have argued my position and view of things with him? Is my ego so big that I’m on here asking these questions in the first place? If anyone else has any experience like this with a recruiter or interviewer, please let me know!

**Command Keeper**, my menu bar app for managing Terminal commands, SQL queries, and other developer-oriented snippets has had several updates this summer. Here's a summary of what's new and/or improved since June:

* You can now share individual snippets via macOS’ Sharing Services when creating or editing them
* The current snippet mode is reflected in the button icon, they now can change from copying to inserting and vice versa with a menu selection or keyboard shortcut
* The program can now check for updates at start up
* You can now define up to four (4) custom Placeholder Variables, which can be used to insert domain names, email addresses, or anything else that's relevant for your command snippets
* Fixed the UI rendering, so it now works properly on macOS Tahoe Beta4+
* Added support for Alacrity (in addition to macOS Terminal, Ghostty, Warp, and iTerm2 support)
* Added the ability to use built-in Placeholder Variables, which are values such key user folder paths, UNIX time stamps, UUIDs, etc. that get dynamically expanded when a snippet is copied to the clipboard or inserted into your Terminal app

**Revok**, my metadata file scanning app has enjoyed a number of new features and improvements this summer. Some of the bigger changes are:

* Added new metadata field to show the UNIX file owner value for a given app
* Added a check to make sure that Xcode Command Line Tools are installed, as it may have been possible to run Revok and it silently fail because some required tools like `codesign` need to run
* Added an option to check for program updates when the program starts
* Made various optimizations that increase the speed of scans by up to 20% or more
* Added an option to right-click on any app listed in the scanned app table to launch it, reveal the app's location in the Finder, delete the app, or even pass the app to my buik checksum calculator app, **File Fingerprints**, if installed
* Released `revok-cli`, a companion, command-line version of Revok that supports a large subset of metadata attributes that can export scan results to JSON and CSV files and be controlled with shell scripts

Finally, **Trash Buddy Plus**, my menu bar-based Trash enhancer app has also recieved some nice updates and improvements, including:

* Added the ability to set the transparency of the Desktop Trash icon
* Added the ability to change the app's menu bar icon
* Improved the reliability of the right-click functionality to inspect or empty the Trash of the Desktop Trash icon

1mk319o,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealPCmaster/comments/1mk319o/can_the_best_graphics_tablet_gaomon_pd1161_boost/,Can the best graphics tablet GAOMON PD1161 boost your artwork,"Testing out the GAOMON PD1161, a 11.6-inch drawing pen display, took me on an exciting journey as someone who spends a lot of time working with digital art and graphic design. As a frequent user of pen displays, I was eager to see if this device could deliver the blend of performance, comfort, and features I’ve come to expect in this competitive market. With its sleek design, portable size, and promising specifications, I had plenty of material to explore.

**Compact and Vibrant Design**

The GAOMON PD1161 is immediately striking due to its compact size and solid build. The 11.6-inch display felt just right—not overwhelmingly large, but spacious enough to work on detailed projects. Its 1920x1080 resolution ensures crisp visuals while color reproduction came through beautifully on its IPS panel. I work with complex palettes daily, and the screen captured differences in shades impressively well. The 178-degree viewing angle also meant I could shift the way I positioned myself without compromising visibility. It combines practicality with portability, being lightweight enough to carry to coffee shops or client meetings. Admittedly, my only complaint here would be the lack of a built-in stand. I had to rely on an adjustable stand I already own, which some users might find inconvenient.

**Smooth Performance and Tilt Functionality**

Where the GAOMON PD1161 shines is in its responsiveness. The battery-free pen, coupled with the 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity, made drawing feel natural and intuitive. From delicate feathering to bold strokes, I could see nuanced differences based on my hand pressure. This is especially useful when you rely on variation in stroke depth or width. The ±60-degree tilt functionality allowed me to experiment with shading techniques, much like using a real pencil. I even tried intricate details for illustration work, and the 266RPS report rate ensured everything appeared fluid and free from noticeable lag.

**[Check GAOMON PD1161 deals on Amazon now.](https://shopperscout.com/p/b08dk39y22/)**

**Customizable Express Keys for Workflow Optimization**

Being someone who likes to streamline tasks, I found the eight programmable shortcut keys a game changer. These keys sit conveniently on the left-hand side, making it easy to zoom, scroll, and toggle between tools without interrupting my rhythm. Depending on your art software preference—Photoshop for illustrations or Lightroom for photo retouching—assigning these keys can dramatically speed up productivity. While GAOMON has cleverly positioned these features for right-handed users, left-handed artists might need to rethink their setup, as the device seems less tailored for them.

**Compatible with Multiple Platforms**

Another aspect that drew me in was the device’s compatibility. It works seamlessly with both Windows and macOS, alongside most popular art programs out there. I tested it on Adobe Photoshop, Corel Painter, and Krita, and each software ran flawlessly. Installation came together fairly smoothly by downloading the necessary driver from GAOMON's website. Occasionally, I did have to reconfigure settings when switching between programs, which was slightly annoying but not a deal-breaker. One caveat worth noting is that the GAOMON PD1161 must be connected to a computer to function—it doesn’t work as a standalone tablet.

**Strengths**

- **Vivid visuals**: Clear details and vibrant colors on the 1920x1080 screen.
- **Natural drawing experience**: The pen's pressure sensitivity and tilt support feel lifelike.
- **Portability**: Lightweight and easy to carry while maintaining professional quality.
- **Customizability**: Eight programmable keys cater to your preferred workflow.
- **Wide compatibility**: Works with both Windows and macOS, alongside most art-related software.

**Areas of Improvement**

- **No built-in stand**: Makes setup cumbersome for prolonged use.
- **Left-hand usability**: Fewer provisions for left-handed users.
- **Limited independence**: Needs to be tethered to a computer at all times.

**Competing Brands**

Comparing this pen display to competitors like the Wacom One or XP-Pen Artist 12 yielded some interesting contrasts. Wacom still offers unparalleled reliability but comes with a significantly higher price point. The XP-Pen Artist 12 positions itself as a strong rival, offering similar features for slightly less but compromises a touch on pen responsiveness. While GAOMON PD1161 might not carry an instantly recognizable brand name, it bridges the gap effectively between premium and budget options. Its accuracy and design simplicity hold their own very well against peers.

**Cost Efficiency**

Is this device worth the investment? For the features it offers—smooth pen performance, excellent display quality, and after-use adjustability—I genuinely think it provides solid bang for your buck. Similar tablets by established brands often cost significantly more without offering drastically better functionality. Beginners and professionals alike will appreciate its affordable quality, particularly for tasks like digital art, 3D sculpting, or even basic photo editing.

1mk30h7,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1mk30h7/second_breath/,Second Breath,"Kabir didn’t scream. He didn’t write a letter. He didn’t make any scene.  
He just walked out of his small rented flat one evening, locked the door behind him, and headed toward that old bridge at the edge of the city — the one he used to love as a kid. It once felt magical. Now, it just felt like a way out.

Life hadn’t broken him in one loud crash.  
It was more like a ceiling that leaked for years — slow, unnoticed, until one day the roof collapsed.

A relationship that ended without closure.  
A job loss he never saw coming.  
Friends who quietly drifted away.  
And a silence from family that didn’t sound like peace, but punishment.

He kept holding on, hoping that maybe tomorrow would look different.  
But every time hope began to grow, life pulled the roots out again.  
Until one day, he looked in the mirror and felt… nothing.

When he reached the bridge, the sky had already turned grey.  
The wind pressed against his skin like cold hands.  
He walked to the edge, looked down at the water, and took a deep breath — not because he wanted to stay…  
but because it might have been his last.

Then came a voice.

“That spot’s already taken,” someone said casually.

Kabir turned, startled.  
A man, maybe in his sixties, sat on a nearby bench. He held a coffee cup in one hand and a sketchpad in the other.  
He didn’t look shocked. He didn’t ask anything.

Just smiled — softly. Like someone who had stood in the same place once, and remembered how it felt.

Kabir didn’t speak. He just stood there.

The man tapped the bench beside him. “Come, sit. No pressure.”

Kabir didn’t know why, but he walked over and sat down.  
Maybe because the man wasn’t trying to fix him.  
He just made space.

For a while, they said nothing.  
Only the wind spoke, weaving quietly between them like an old memory.

Then the man asked, “You were thinking about it, weren’t you?”

Kabir looked down at his hands. Then nodded.

“I did too,” the man said. “Right there. Same spot. Few years ago.”

Kabir looked at him more closely. He didn’t seem like someone who had ever fallen apart.  
But pain wears different faces. Some smile.

“What stopped you?” Kabir asked.

The man turned his sketchpad around and showed him a rough drawing — a little girl holding a balloon.

“She ran past me that night,” he said. “Laughing like she still believed the world was worth something. She didn’t even notice me. But I saw her. And in that second… I remembered I used to laugh too.”

He paused, looking at the sketch.  
Then added quietly, “Hope doesn’t always knock. Sometimes it just walks by, dressed like a stranger.”

He looked back at the water.

“I told myself — just one more week. I’ll live one more week.  
Do small things. Eat something warm. Talk to someone. Feel the wind.  
If nothing changed, I could always come back.”

Kabir didn’t know what to say.

The man smiled. “I never came back. Until today.  
Just to remind myself how close I came to missing everything I hadn’t seen yet.”

They sat in silence a while longer.  
The river below moved like time — steady, uncaring, beautiful in its own way.

Then the man stood up, finished his coffee, and said,

“You don’t need a big reason to stay.  
Just give yourself a few more mornings.”

And he walked away.

Kabir didn’t move at first.  
Then slowly, he stood up too — not because everything was okay,  
but because maybe… it didn’t have to be.

He walked back home.  
No missed calls. No miracle.

But inside, something had shifted — not healed, not fixed — just… softened.

That night, he didn’t write a goodbye letter.

He took out an old notebook, turned to the first page, and wrote:

1mk2yse,https://i.redd.it/4cebma2b7mhf1.jpeg,Remarriage: His Billionaire Ex-wife. Anyone knows where to read this story for free?,"""Trissy, please don't send any messages to Lucas late at night. He's my husband.""

　　Trissy was Lucas' first love, but she had married Lucas' elder brother, Max. Since Max died, Trissy had been pestering Lucas all the time.

　　That troubled Jessica a lot, so she had to talk to Trissy in person.

　　""Only legally. He is in love with ME. But you don't have to worry. I will make him leave you."" Trissy sneered, not taking what Jessica said seriously.

　　Today was the dinner for the announcement of the new CEO of the Thomas Group, the most famous enterprise in LA, to take over the affairs of the group.

　　Justin Thomas, the original CEO, Lucas' grandfather, announced that the new CEO is Lucas in front of the entire upper—class circle in LA.

　　Suddenly, the banquet was interrupted by some servants out in the garden.

　　""Help! Help! Jessica and Trissy fell down the stairs!""

　　People hurried to the garden. Before everyone else could react, Lucas had already picked up Trissy, who was unconscious on the floor.

　　However, Lucas ignored his wife, Jessica, who was lying on the cold ground. Instead, Lucas carried Trissy and left without looking back.

　　People finally came to their senses too and followed Lucas to the villa.

　　After a long time, Jessica gradually came to her senses, she realized that she was lying on the cold ground. People had all left. Nobody cared about her life at all.

　　Ever since married Lucas, Jessica had gotten used to being ignored by the Thomas family.

　　Holding her sore arm, Jessica prepared to go back to her room to shower and check for cuts, but she had only reached the stairs when Lucas called out to her.

　　""You are so vicious! How could you push Trissy downstairs? Don't you know she's ill?"" Lucas looked at Jessica coldly. Jessica's whole body was full of dust.

　　""How is Trissy? Lucas, listen to me. I didn't push her."" Jessica explained eagerly.

　　""Before she fainted, she said it was you that pushed her, and then she dragged you, that's why you both fell down the stairs together. I don't believe Trissy would lie."" Lucas said angrily.

　　""I didn't do that. Why don't you believe me?"" With her eyes turning red, Jessica looked at Lucas sadly.

　　""Isn't it just because Trissy was about to fall at the beginning of the party and I helped her, and you were jealous and looking for her to settle the score? Well I don't want to hear your sophistry. Keep your made—up story to Grandpa."" Lucas ignored the despair in Jessica's eyes. He stood up and pulled Jessica's arm, intending to take her to the meeting room.

　　As the most beloved grandson of Justin Thomas as well as the future heir of the Thomas Group, Lucas had always been impartial. Besides, Lucas hated Jessica, his wife, a lot.

　　""I can walk by myself."" Jessica got rid of Lucas' hand with her painful arm.

　　""Then follow up."" Lucas didn't give Jessica a second look. He turned around and walked quickly to the meeting room.

　　Looking at Lucas' tall figure from the back, Jessica felt she was overwhelmed by sorrow. She used to be so obsessed with Lucas, yet Lucas hated her so much.

　　The announcement procedure of the new CEO was interrupted. Justin was furious.

　　Thus, when Justin saw Jessica walk in, he directly threw his mug over. The hot coffee splashed all over Jessica. Jessica couldn't help but cry out in pain.

　　Justin yelled at Jessica, ""You son of a bitch.""

　　Jessica asked calmly, ""I don't know what I've done wrong.""

　　Justin looked at Lucas angrily and said, ""Lucas, are you waiting for me to explain to your wife?""

　　""If you can't calm Grandpa down today, I'll divorce you."" Lucas kicked Jessica in the knee, causing her already painful legs to sit limply on the ground because they couldn't take the force.

　　""I am your wife! How can you do this to me?"" Although Jessica knew that Lucas did not love her, she could not bear it when her husband, to whom she had been married for three years, was so merciless to her.

　　Jessica felt a sharp pain in her knees, even though it was far less than the pain in her heart.

　　""Jessica, if you confess to Trissy and are willing to accept punishment, I may still allow you to stay in this house,"" Justin said to Jessica.

　　""I already said that I didn't push Trissy, so I won't apologize.""

　　Before Jessica could finish, Justin had already thrown another mug over.

　　The mug shattered on the ground, and the shards hit Jessica, but she did not move.

　　""Lucas, I hope you can persuade your wife. For God's sake, Trissy is still in a coma in the hospital. What a poor child!"" Justin stood up and left the meeting room.

...

　　""Jessica, get up now. The shards are all over you."" After Justin left, Rebecca, Lucas' mother, hurried over, trying to help Jessica up.

　　""Mom, wait."" Lucas reached out to stop Rebecca. He then looked down at Jessica and asked, ""Did you hear what Grandpa just said? Do you know what you have done wrong now?""

　　""Lucas, I think I've made it very clear. I didn't push Trissy. I did nothing wrong.""

　　Although Jessica was trembling with cold, she looked at Lucas firmly. She wouldn't give in.

　　""Then from today you don't live in Thomas house, people like you don't deserve to be in the same house as us!"" Lucas nodded at the butler, beckoning him to come over and take Jessica away.

　　Rebecca shook her head in disagreement and said to Lucas, ""Jessica is your wife. How can you treat her like that?""

　　""Such a vicious woman can't be my wife,"" Lucas replied coldly.

　　Jessica suddenly felt a shooting pain in her heart. Originally, she planned to show Lucas the evidence so that Lucas would know he had blamed her wrongly. But now, she decided not to bother.

　　With that, Lucas left without looking back.

　　As Lucas walked away, Jessica felt that her feelings for Lucas were perishing as well.

　　The butler glanced at Rebecca. Lucas was second only to Justin in the Thomas family, so the butler did not dare to disobey Lucas. The butler bowed slightly to Jessica, who was sitting on the ground, and said, ""Jessica, please do not make things difficult for me.""

　　""Go tell Lucas that I'm not going anywhere. I'm going back to my room to take a shower and change my clothes."" Jessica said as she stood up. She shook off the shards on her pants and calmly walked upstairs, leaving Rebecca and the butler in surprise.

　　When Jessica got back to her room, she checked her wounds first, and luckily she only scraped a little skin on her arms and legs.

　　She gave herself medicine and changed into clean clothes, then she packed her belongings one by one into her suitcase.

　　After all this was done, Jessica sat at the dressing table to comb her hair, when Lucas suddenly stormed in.

　　Before Jessica could say anything, Lucas pulled her wrist, almost making her fall from her chair.

　　""Lucas, are you out of your mind?""

　　""I'm not, but you are. You hurt Trissy, and you don't think you've done anything wrong."" With indifference in his eyes, Lucas said fiercely, ""Jessica, the first thing Trissy did when she woke up was ask us not to blame you, saying that it was her own actions that made you misunderstand, and you continue to feel no guilt about hurting her!""

　　""That's enough!"" Jessica felt that Lucas almost broke her wrist. She struggled and shouted, ""She rolled down the stairs by herself, I didn't touch her at all!""

　　Lucas froze at her words, and Jessica took this chance to get rid of Lucas' grip.

　　Jessica stumbled to her feet, looked at the guy she used to love, and said calmly, ""I know you don't believe me, so let's get a divorce, Lucas.""

　　Lucas thought that his anger would make Jessica yield. However, not only did Jessica not confess, but she even asked for a divorce.

　　With that, Jessica opened the door and left. She moved slowly because she felt sore all over her body.

　　But even so, she still did not look back at Lucas.

　　""Jessica! Where are you going?"" Lucas' sister, Olivia saw Jessica heading out with her suitcase and she asked loudly, ""You're not stealing from the house and trying to go out and sell it, are you?""

　　""Olivia, what are you talking about?"" Rebecca frowned and nudged Olivia.

　　""I don't care even 1 bulk of Thomas'."" Jessica retorted in a rare moment, and Olivia immediately got angry and tried to argue with her, but Jessica had already turned around and left.

　　Jessica took her suitcase and left the Thomas villa. Standing outside the gate, Jessica called her friend Hannah.

　　Shortly, Hannah drove over.

　　""Why are you standing here alone? Did Lucas drive you out? That bastard!"" Hannah asked as she quickly got out of the car and ran to Jessica.

　　""I decided to leave. Hannah, I want a divorce."" Looking at Hannah, Jessica said.

　　""Are you sure?"" Gazing at Jessica, Hannah tried to figure out how determined Jessica was. As Jessica's friend, Hannah knew how much Jessica loved Lucas.

　　Jessica nodded hard, and Hannah breathed a sigh of relief. ""Darling, finally! Lucas is not worthy of you at all. Let's get out of here. Don't be sad. Let's find a bar and have some fun so that you can get over that dickhead.""

...

　　When Jessica woke up, it was already the next morning. She had a French feast with Hannah yesterday evening, and then had some drinks and danced the whole night. They got home early in the morning.

　　Jessica felt as if she had been crushed by a car after a hangover. She felt weak and sore.

　　Hanna walked into Jessica's room with a glass of milk and handed it to her. ""The news on the Internet spreads fast.""

　　""Really? Where is my phone?"" Jessica took a sip of milk and took over her phone, handed over by Hannah. Jessica logged in to Twitter and started swiping.

　　The top of the trending topics was about Jessica pushing Trissy downstairs at Justin's annoucement banquet. Jessica swiped her phone and read the comments casually. Almost all were scolding Jessica for being vicious. And some people exposed Jessica's ordinary background, saying Jessica was not worthy of a rich person like Lucas. Some even assumed that Jessica might have played some tricks to marry into such a wealthy family.

　　The public was particularly interested in the scandal of the rich families while Trissy happened to enjoy exposing her life to the public. This made the Thomas family almost become a second Kardashian.

　　""Jessica, don't be sad because of these harsh comments."" Hannah comforted Jessica.

　　""Sad?"" Jessica smiled. She then took out a document from her bag and handed it to Hannah, ""Take a look.""

　　Hannah opened the folder in confusion and realized it was a divorce agreement. She looked at Jessica in surprise and quickly browsed through the contents of the document. ""Sweetie, why did you give up on the alimony? Lucas should pay it!""

　　""I don't care about the money. Come on, get the car key and we'll go to Lucas' office later."" Jessica finished the milk in one gulp and walked into the bathroom with her cosmetic bag.

　　Three years had passed and Jessica didn't want to wait for Lucas anymore.

　　An hour later, Jessica walked directly into the Thomas Group's office building in Los Angeles with the divorce agreement. Lucas, who was sitting in his office, was also informed of Jessica's arrival by his secretary.

　　Jessica walked directly to Lucas' office in her high heels. She knocked on the door and pushed it open before the door was answered. She casually threw the document on Lucas' desk and said, ""Tomorrow at 9 o'clock, we'll go through the divorce procedures. I hope you will be there on time,"" without the gentle tone all along.

　　With that, Jessica turned around and left without hesitation.

　　Sitting at his desk, Lucas saw Jessica off. His eyes gradually darkened. He reached out and took the divorce document. Jessica had already signed it.

　　The regulations on it were very clear that Jessica had given up on any property of Lucas, including the alimony.

　　Lucas couldn't help but sneer. That woman wanted nothing?

　　How could Jessica be so assertive?

　　Or perhaps Jessica was just pretending, trying to make Lucas feel that she didn't give a damn about his money?

　　Lucas decided to see if Jessica was really going to divorce him the next day or if she was just playing some tricks.

　　Jessica left the office building in a great mood. She originally thought that she would be sad when the two of them had to part ways, but she was surprisingly calm.

　　Perhaps Jessica had been disappointed too many times. Now that she had decided to part with Lucas, she felt more than relieved.

　　Jessica walked to the car and knocked on the window. Hannah was answering the phone, and when Hannah saw that it was Jessica, she hurriedly opened the door.

　　""Who is that?"" Jessica got in the car and fastened her seat belt, then she raised an eyebrow at Hannah.

　　""Caesar and Lance, I'll tell them the good news, you're free now, and we can get together more often from now on.""

　　""That's for sure."" Jessica smiled.

　　At this time, Jessica's phone also rang, she glanced at the phone screen, it was an unfamiliar call.

　　Jessica picked it up with some confusion.

　　""Hello, Miss Hall, I am Mr. Hall's assistant Wendy. I will be your assistant from today onwards."" A gentle woman's voice came from the other side of the phone.

　　Jessica froze for a few seconds before saying to the phone, ""Did Daddy ask to call me?""

　　""Yes, Mr. Hall said that you are welcome home anytime."" When Jessica heard Wendy's words, her eyes instantly moistened.

　　Three years ago, Jessica was determined to marry Lucas. Her parents and friends were all against it, but Jessica insisted on it. She believed that if she treated Lucas sincerely, she would be treated the same way in return.

　　Yet in the end, the past three years only proved how wrong Jessica is.

　　It turned out that Lucas married her not because he loved her, or he admired her, but because Jessica was Lucas' second choice when Trissy was not an option.

　　Thinking of that, Jessica's tears finally flowed down.

...

　　Jessica suddenly cried, making Hannah, who was beside her, feel sad. They had been friends since they were little.

　　For so many years, Jessica had always been a smart and noble young princess. Hannah had never seen Jessica being ill—treated like now.

　　It was all Lucas Thomas' fault!

　　A few minutes later, Jessica gradually calmed down. She took the tissue and wiped her tears. She took out a mirror to fix her makeup. Jessica quickly adjusted her mood and turned to look at Hannah. She asked, ""Hannah, I heard that your cousin knows reporters from the Los Angeles Times? Is he interested in an exclusive report?""

　　""No problem, I will call my cousin Eden right now."" Hannah froze for a moment and then figured out what Jessica planned to do. Hannah then took out her phone.

　　Jessica nodded and looked out through the window.

　　After three years, Jessica finally accepted the fact that she could not replace Trissy in Lucas' heart. She lost.

　　However, Jessica would not let the Thomas family get away with the ill—treatment she had received in the past three years.

　　""Do you want to hang out tonight?"" After Hannah hung up the phone, she turned to look at Jessica and asked.

　　""Nope. Tomorrow is a big day."" Jessica smiled.

　　Jessica went to bed before ten in the evening, yet Hannah didn't stop quarreling with the strangers who blamed Jessica on Twitter. Thus, Hannah had trouble getting up the next morning.

　　When Hannah rubbed her eyes as she walked out of the door, Jessica was already ready to go.

　　Today, Jessica had a simple and sexy outfit. She wore a loose dark brown sweater, with her long blonde hair down on her shoulders, and a pair of dark blue denim pants. The black high heels she wore revealed her slender ankles.

　　Hannah nodded in satisfaction and said, ""Go, say goodbye to the past and embrace the future.""

　　Jessica opened the door with a smile and walked out of the room.

　　When Jessica arrived at the entrance of the court, Lucas had not arrived yet. Yesterday, she had already asked the lawyer to submit the divorce application to the court. Thus, she only needs to go through the process today.

　　Five minutes later, Jessica saw Lucas walking in from outside the gate.

　　Lucas, as usual, was dressed in a suit and leather shoes, his angular face expressionless.

　　When Lucas noticed Jessica's gaze, he tilted his head slightly and looked coldly at her. In the past, Jessica would always immediately get close to him, but this time, she just stood there still, not intending to move at all.

　　Lucas had to walk toward her.

　　""Good morning Mr. Thomas, the judge is already waiting for us."" Jessica nodded moodily toward Lucas.

　　""Have you thought it through?"" Lucas' face darkened, he thought Jessica was feigning relief.

　　""I have."" Jessica answered, word by word.

　　Lucas looked gloomy. He frowned and said, ""Very well. I hope you won't regret it in the future.""

　　After the divorce, Jessica would no longer be a member of the Thomas family, and she could not live a luxurious life anymore. Lucas thought that Jessica would definitely regret it when life became hard for her.

　　The two did not speak again and walked into the court together.

　　When they came out again, the two were no longer husband and wife. They were like strangers. After all, they could not even be considered friends.

　　Lucas looked at Jessica and said, ""Even though we are divorced, Trissy was hurt because of you, I think you should at least go to the hospital and take care of her until she recovers.""

　　A cold wind blew by, and Jessica felt that the wind was not as cold as her heart. Jessica found herself a fool that she once thought Lucas could stand on her side.

　　Jessica tucked her hair behind her ear and looked at Lucas. ""What? Can't the Thomas family even afford an escort anymore? If that's the case, I'll pass on the divorce gift I prepared for you to Trissy, and I hope she receives it for a speedy recovery.""

　　With that, Jessica took one last look at Lucas and left.

　　Lucas looked at Jessica's tall and graceful figure from the back. He found that he had never sized Jessica up properly in all these years. Somehow, the thought troubled Lucas.

　　Lucas never thought about divorcing Jessica, though he was not very willing to marry her.

　　Now that they were really divorced, Lucas felt a bit sad as if he had lost something. But he quickly adjusted his mood. After all, Jessica was just a woman he was not in love with.

...

　　When Jessica returned to Hannah's place, Hannah had already cleaned up the house. Hannah was putting the fried steak onto a plate, and the red wine was on the table as well.

　　""Welcome back!"" Hannah looked at Jessica excitedly. ""Let's have a lavish meal today and hang out tonight.""

　　Jessica sat down in front of the table and smiled at Hannah. ""No, I'm leaving LA tonight.""

　　Three years ago, for the sake of Lucas, Jessica had left New York, where her parents lived.

　　Now that Lucas and Jessica were done, she didn't want to stay in LA anymore.

　　However, before leaving, she had to send the divorce gift she had prepared, so she said to Hannah, ""You can get someone to send out the audios I sent you.""

　　Hannah said excitedly, ""No problem, I've been waiting for you to say that. Wait for me, I'll make a call now. Let's go back to New York together tonight!""

　　""Aren't you having fun here with Mona?"" Jessica asked, surprised to hear her say that.

　　""I haven't been back to New York in years, either, and my parents miss me."" Hannah waved her hand.

　　Jessica knew that a girl like Hannah, who was brought up in a rich family, didn't need to worry about money at all. The reason why Hannah opened a studio in LA is to be here with Jessica. Jessica was touched by what Hannah had done for her.

　　At eight in the evening, Jessica and Hannah arrived at the airport and boarded a plane to New York.

　　At the same time, a well—known reporter from the Los Angeles Times released a video on YouTube. The video showed how Jessica and Trissy falling downstairs at Thomas' family banquet.

　　In the video, Jessica didn't even touch Trissy at all. It was Trissy with a smug smile on her face who walked up the stairs herself, and she dragged Jessica down too before she fell. Their conversation could be heard clearly as well.

　　""Trissy, please don't send any messages to Lucas late at night. He's my husband.""

　　""Only legally. He is in love with ME. But you don't have to worry. I will make him leave you.

　　""As long as I tell Lucas that you pushed me, the Thomas family will believe me. Your explanation will be useless. Do you know why? Don't you know who you are? Do you think a ordinary person is qualified to be a member of the Thomas family?""

　　As soon as the video and audio were released, the entire social network was boiling. The scandal in the Thomas family was still among the hottest topics, yet a reversal then came. People were all shocked.

　　Soon, the news reached Lucas. After watching the video, Lucas remained silent at his table with a grim face.

　　Then, Lucas' secretary told him that Jessica emptied her Twitter, leaving only one tweet, saying ""Happy divorce to you!""

　　Jessica announced their divorce in such a way, especially after the truth comes out. How ironic! It made the Thomas family ridiculous.

　　The atmosphere in the office was so depressing that people even found breathing hard. Lucas, who was sitting at the desk, wore a grim face.

　　""Remove it now!""

　　""I'm sorry, Mr. Thomas. I've already contacted the public relations company. It can't be removed."" The secretary felt nervous.

　　Well done, Jessica!

　　With a stern face, Lucas reached for his phone. He was about to call Jessica when his phone suddenly rang.

...

　　Lucas stared at his phone. His face turned grim when he saw who was calling him. Lucas paused a bit before he pressed the answer button and said, ""Grandpa.""

　　""Did Jessica post that video online? Where is she now? Tell her to delete the video and take her home!"" Justin's deep voice was filled with anger.

　　""I see, Grandpa."" Lucas hung up the phone and dialed Jessica's number. A cold system message came from the phone. ""Please leave your message after the beep.""

　　Thomas Group's stock price had been falling ever since the scandal of Trissy and Thomas family was posted online. Justin's blood pressure rose out of anger, but Lucas could not reach Jessica at all. Lucas could only go home by himself to face Justin's fury.

　　""Where's Jessica Thomas?"" Justin asked loudly when he saw Lucas coming alone.

　　""Grandpa, I divorced Jessica already, so she's not Jessica Thomas anymore,"" Lucas said with a frown.

　　""I don't care if you've divorced or not. The company's stock price is dropping rapidly. You are the CEO now. Show me your capability to solve crisis. In addition, what Jessica did disgraced our family's fame. I want her to declare the facts and apologize in a press conference!""

　　""I will handle it. Grandpa, take care."" Lucas did not explain much. He glanced at the butler and left. After getting into his car, Lucas said to the driver, ""To the hospital.""

　　Currently, it was basically impossible to make Jessica apologize and clean up the scandal. Besides, he was too occupied to have Jessica located. But Justin made a fair point. Lucas did need to solve the current crisis of the Thomas family.

　　In the whole thing, Jessica played one part while Trissy played another.

　　Trissy was in the hospital at the moment. She was shocked to see the widely spread news.

　　She had never thought that Jessica would keep such solid evidence.

　　Now that this video was exposed, it was difficult for Trissy to stay in the Thomas family.

　　Was Jessica out of her mind? Was Jessica trying to destroy both Trissy and herself?

　　Just as Trissy was freaking out, someone walked into her ward.

　　It was Lucas. Lucas stared coldly at Trissy and asked, ""Is what's in the video true?""

　　In fact, Lucas didn't need to ask. The video proved to be unedited. He just wanted to hear Trissy's explanation.

　　To Lucas' disappointment, Trissy was no longer as calm as she used to be. Instead, she explained nervously, ""No, it isn't. Lucas, listen to me. It's Jessica. Jessica made me say that. Trust me.""

　　Trissy reached out trying to grab Lucas' arm.

　　After hearing Trissy's explanation, Lucas' face darkened. Holding his anger deep inside, Lucas said to Trissy, ""Pack your things up. I will have someone send you away from LA tomorrow.""

　　""No, no, no! Lucas, I don't want to leave LA. Max will be sad in heaven, he must not want me to leave his home.""

　　Trissy knew that the Thomas family was about to give up on her. Once she left LA, she would no longer be related to the Thomas family.

　　Trissy begged Lucas while hating Jessica in her heart, if this woman was not too crazy, she would not have lost this luxurious life now.

　　However, Lucas did not respond. Instead, he left the ward without looking back.

　　This news had been spread on the Internet for three days and had become known to almost everyone. Those people who once laughed at Jessica now found her pitiful.

　　Sending Trissy away wasn't of any help to the Thomas family. While Jessica couldn't be reached, which confused Lucas as well.

　　Jessica couldn't be found anywhere. No one knew where she had gone. Jessica had canceled her phone number, bank card, and everything else in LA. The only information that could be found was that she had bought a ticket to New York on the night of the divorce.

　　However, Lucas' assistant, Vincent, could not find any clues in New York, so he had to report it to Lucas.

　　Sitting at his desk for a while, Lucas threw the material that Vincent had given him into the trash can.

　　Well done, Jessica.",1,1754580095.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1mk2yl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheStoWicks/comments/1mk2yl2/drowning_in_noise_31/,Drowning in Noise - 31,"# The StoWicks Conversations by Seth and Carolyn Wicks

**Today's Key Points:**

* Modern Noise Disrupts Brain Function
* Natural Sounds Reduce Stress
* Silence Supports Focus and Recovery

**Carolyn:** We’re surrounded by noise. Not just the obvious kind, traffic, sirens, phones pinging, but a constant hum of background sound we’ve learned to live with: podcasts during workouts, music while we focus, TV in the next room. In [*The Comfort Crisis*](https://eastermichael.com/book/), Michael Easter makes a powerful observation: we’ve become so used to filling every quiet space that we don’t realize what it’s costing us. Modern noise is rewiring our brains. It chips away at our focus, raises stress levels, and keeps our nervous system stuck in a low-grade fight-or-flight state. Most of us have no idea what true silence—or even just the sound of nature—feels like anymore.

**Seth:** We did a newsletter a few months ago about [boredom](https://ckarchive.com/b/zlughnhk8p2m5a7qrr9qehwzgng00f6) and how it sparks creativity. I won't say that walking with Carolyn is boring (I have *some* intelligence), but it is slow-paced and intentionally unhurried—something we do to get outside and connect. There’s something about an hour-and-a-half walk in the park that taps into something primal. Sure, we’re talking about 100 different topics as usual, but it’s also about the **right kind of noise.**

We hear kids playing in the park and living their best life. We hear squirrels fighting for their nut (interpret that how you will). We hear birds chirping, the wind blowing against the trees, or sometimes, silence. The point? [Studies](chttps://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2013097118?utm_source=chatgpt.com) show that listening to natural sounds improves overall health and lowers stress levels. It's not just background noise, it's therapy.

**Carolyn:** Carolyn's Science Corner is back 🤓 Studies show that constant noise, especially the kind we’ve normalized like traffic, buzzing appliances, or even background conversations, activates the brain’s stress pathways. It [triggers the amygdala and raises cortisol](https://time.com/6210320/how-listening-to-silence-changes-our-brains/), putting the nervous system in a low-grade fight-or-flight mode. Over time, [this chips away at the prefrontal cortex](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-023-01986-4), the part of the brain responsible for focus, decision-making, and emotional regulation. It’s no wonder we feel scattered, irritable, or overstimulated. One study even found that [two minutes of silence](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1860846/) was more calming to the brain than relaxing music. It’s wild: silence isn’t just peaceful, it actually helps the brain restore itself. But because we rarely experience it, our minds stay in a loop of hyperstimulation, never quite settling.

**Seth:** The effects of sound don’t stop when you're awake, they follow you into sleep. We haven't done a full newsletter on sleep yet (it's in the works), but it's one of the most important things you can do for your overall health. Think about it: if every mammal on Earth needs sleep, evolution clearly thinks it’s essential. There's no good reason for us to spend a third of our lives unconscious, unless it's absolutely *vital* for how we function.

What’s wild is that the sounds you hear while sleepin**g** can influence your sleep quality. Listening to specific sounds while sleeping can improve [cognitive function](https://time.com/4694555/pink-noise-deep-sleep-improve-memory/?utm) and [reduce anxiety and depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37484105/).

And as always, we don’t suggest anything we haven’t tried ourselves. Lately, we’ve been falling asleep to the sound of a creek flowing—and we’ve both noticed a tangible difference in our energy levels and mental clarity the next day. Long story short: it works.

**Carolyn:** Once I understood what modern sound was doing to my brain, I stopped seeing silence as a luxury, and started treating it like a form of recovery. Just like your body needs rest after a tough workout, your brain needs relief from constant sensory input. Now I try to carve out silence on purpose: no music during walks a few times a week, no podcast while I tidy up, no background noise while I cook. It’s about margin. That margin gives my nervous system space to downregulate, my focus room to rebuild, and my thoughts time to sharpen. We tend to chase hacks and supplements for mental clarity, but **sometimes the most powerful thing you can give your brain is nothing at all.**

**Seth:** Another spot we’ve become more intentional with noise is the gym. Carolyn and I don’t wear headphones when we lift or run. Part of it is that we’re together. Between sets, we’re talking, spotting each other, or just sharing a moment. But during the actual work? It’s just us and the weight.

There’s something raw about it. No music to drown out the pain. No distraction to pull me out of the moment. It becomes a mental challenge as much as a physical one—especially with heavy lifts. I can’t escape the discomfort, I have to meet it. And somehow, that makes it more satisfying. I'm not just building my body, I'm sharpening my mind, rep by rep.

**Carolyn:** This week, try carving out just ten minutes of intentional silence. No headphones, no background noise, just you and your thoughts. Go for a walk, fold the laundry, or sit with your coffee. Notice what comes up.

**Seth:** If you have trouble sleeping, mix things up tonight. Dim the lights, turn off screens an hour before bed, and consider adding calming natural soundscapes to your nighttime routine.

**Both:** You might be surprised how much your brain has been waiting for the peace and quiet.

See you next week,  
Seth & Carolyn

1mk2xma,https://www.reddit.com/r/themoviejunkiedotcom/comments/1mk2xma/the_naked_gun_2025_movie_review_worthy_successor/,The Naked Gun 2025 Movie Review: Worthy Successor to The Naked Gun 1988,"It's been quite a while since anyone has tried to fill the large floppy shoes of Leslie Nielsen in The Naked Gun Franchise, and Liam Neeson does not disappoint. The trailer promo seemed only slightly over the top, hinting at unpalatable jokes which only had shock value. But after watching the movie in the theater, I can say with confidence that The Naked Gun 2025 has retained the silly soul of the original and is relentless with its hilarity in the best way possible.



# The Plot



When a wealthy yet maniacal Big Bad hatches a plan to end the world with technology that turns people violent, no one except Frank Drebin Jr. can stop him and his evil machinations.



https://preview.redd.it/08gofpnv5mhf1.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&s=96d9435776b3c2f242e0d21fde763035e2d92fb6

  
Then again, this movie isn't about the plot, is it? The Naked Gun is about silly laughs about stupid and dumb jokes that are fired in such quick succession, with such accuracy and timing that the audience will be left breathless trying to catch up with the jokes.



The world needs movies like these that don't rely on shock value, unnecessary crudeness, or vulgarity. It's plain ( almost ) clean fun, with a heavy sprinkle of toilet humor and its relatives.





# Major Gags in The Naked Gun 2025



# 1. Diarrhea Emergency



One of the more relatable gags in the movie is shown in the trailer, where Frank Drebin Jr. eats food of questionable quality, leading to a diarrhea emergency that he resolves in the most violent ways possible.

https://preview.redd.it/pi0gts316mhf1.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=73e503fd45bba92cf24fc6cafe86237a95a7fb96



After eating chilli dogs, Frank Drebin Jr. goes through one hell of a rollercoaster ride, but after he is done with the emergency, he gets started on a new chilli dog like nothing happened at all.



# 2. High-Speed Coffee



You see Liam Neeson's Frank Drebin Jr. driving at what seems to be a respectable speed with a steely look in his eyes for a few seconds before someone miraculously hands him a coffee while he's still driving at highway speeds!

https://preview.redd.it/v3ma44u46mhf1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b1f0ae21cad7d85421bd2fc9e7b2a5c0788998b

  
The coffee gag keeps on going with him and his partner receiving cups that get bigger each time someone offers the drink.





# 3. Emotional Breakdown En masse



The legacy of this franchise is addressed with the subtlety of an 18-wheeler, seeing every cop in the Police Squad taking a knee to talk to their late cop hero dads, except the one with Nordgreen, who was played by O.J. Simpson.



https://preview.redd.it/5sc74pia6mhf1.png?width=443&format=png&auto=webp&s=98f538c7ad564631b54bf0e6d7ab9e78cf4f6342

  
**4. A Meme in Cinematic Real-time**

https://preview.redd.it/85njckdi6mhf1.png?width=337&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6f786da3c01ad847fa7f435dfff8e05609b8b9b



You see, Busta Rhymes of all people being interrogated by Neeson's Drebin Jr., which looks like a straight-up meme with zero effort.



# 5. Trashing Tesla Clone



Then there's the dig at Tesla combined with the lack of awareness from the side of Frank Drebin Jr., who, in the process of test driving a car, ends up freeing hardened criminals from what looks like a maximum security prison. You also see a Hannibal Lecter type walking around free as a bird, moments later.



https://preview.redd.it/ex4ag1nm6mhf1.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=db8149519ced7580b680846eef9b41f74ea718f6



# The Cast of The Naked Gun 2025 Movie



Liam Neeson as Frank Drebin Jr. was my first ever time seeing him in a comedic role in the movie, apart from A Million Ways to Die in the West ( he was actually the Big Bad ) and his cameo in Ted 2.

Pamela Anderson as Beth surprises us with her great comedic timing and deadpan delivery, and shares great onscreen chemistry with Liam Neeson, which spilled into real life, making them a couple off-screen as well, which I think is kinda sweet. I liked the scene where Pamela *scats* at a jazz club, which is hilarious, yet serves as just a background to more jokes that keep happening all around her.

I went in with a slightly negative outlook into the theater and lasted all of ten minutes before the jokes got to me, and I did not stop laughing until the end credits started rolling.



https://preview.redd.it/xettpc9x6mhf1.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a1c332de6f3b9ad0852b89917e31c32d958dd8f



Cody Rhodes, the WWE professional wrestler, does a fantastic Bartender who gets slammed into three different faces by Frank Drebin Jr., serving as an homage to his profession while also being funny as hell.

Paul Walter Hauser plays Capt. Ed Hocken Jr., who gained fame playing the titular Richard Jewel, followed most recently by the role of Mole Man in [**The Fantastic Four: First Steps**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/fantastic-four-first-steps-2025-movie-review)

Liza Koshy as Detective Barnes has limited screen time but does a lot with the small amount of time she is given, adding to the jokes with her deadpan expression.

David Lengel plays Mr Ice Cream Agent in this movie, and if he seems familiar, it is because he was seen in WandaVision as Phil Jones and reprising the neighbourly role in [**Agatha All Along**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/agatha-all-along-marvel-series-review)

Danny Huston plays Richard Cane, the big bad in this movie, as the rich douchebag who attempts to pull a Samuel L Jackson a la Kingsman: The Secret Service by messing with people's minds on a global scale. He has starred in several iconic roles, such as General Erich Ludendorff in [**Wonder Woman**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/wonder-woman-1984-a-warrior-for-peace) ( 2017 ), Poseidon in Clash of the [**Titans**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/blood-of-zeus-netflix-series-review) and Wrath of the Titans, and of course, [**X-Men**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/80s-and-90s-cartoons-i-grew-up-with-part-i) Origins: Wolverine and General William Stryker.

Kevin Durand as Sig Gustafson plays Huston's henchman, helping him in his evil bid for world domination. He played a similar role in X-Men Origins: [**Wolverine**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/deadpool-wolverine-a-fun-ride) as Fred Duke, who later turns into The Blob.

Busta Rhymes plays a [**Bank Robber**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/money-heist-netflix-series-review) with a single scene and is funnier than most standups and professional comedians in the minute of screentime he is given.

CCH Pounder as Chief Davis has been in every pop culture-relevant movie from Urban Legend to [**Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight**](https://www.themoviejunkie.com/post/more-of-my-favorite-b-grade-movies)**.** She is brilliant in this movie, and there was never a doubt in my mind that she could deliver a comedic performance with great ease

""Weird Al"" Yankovic is featured and mentioned in this movie, in keeping with the 1988 version which is kinda cool as well.



# Should You Watch It? Hell Yes!



This is a no-holds-barred laugh-fest that no one should miss out on, with Liam Neeson in the role of a lifetime, with a possible franchise deal in the works, going by his and Pamela's performance. Watch it!

That my abuser is out here making YouTube videos, giving life advice, calling himself a “millionaire” entrepreneur, and selling courses to hundreds of people when in reality, he’s a broke, manipulative narcissist who spent years abusing, gaslighting, coercing, and scamming.

Let me break it down for you.

I was young. A model. Independent, beautiful, a full-package woman. And he knew it. That’s why he bragged about me nonstop not because he respected me, but because he wanted to flaunt me like a trophy to his friends. He’d go, “Look what I’ve got,” like I was a prize, not a person. Behind closed doors? He treated me like I was nothing.

I had vaginismus and was very insecure about it. He knew. Still, he pressured me for sex constantly. Told me the pain I was feeling wasn’t real, that I just needed to “get used to it.” His exact words? “You’re the best girl, the most beautiful but if the premium coffee shop is closed, you go to another one that’s open.” Comparing me to a damn café because I wasn’t ready to have sex. Disgusting.

Oh, and his obsession with backdoor sex? Relentless. He converted to Islam and cherrypicked parts of the religion to manipulate me. “We can’t have sex during your period because it’s haram,” but suddenly backdoor sex was totally fine because his “spiritual coach” said so? Lies. Straight-up lies. He manipulated religious rules just to pressure me and I found out he lied after we were finished. I cried my eyes out when I realized he lied to my face just to get what he wanted.

There were times he “accidentally” put it in the wrong place while I was saying no. He’d play dumb, like “Oops,” while I was frozen and he would try to continue. It wasn’t an accident. That was coercion, plain and simple.

He physically pushed me once during an argument and said it was part of our “bdsm dynamic” while we were arguing about something and we didnt talk about him being able to do that. Just another way for him to twist reality.

When I flew to London to see him (as a teenager, mind you), he isolated me in his friend’s apartment. Said it was “too dangerous” for me to go out alone (he was scared of me talking to other successful men in the area) so I stayed inside while he ran around with his business buddies. When I had a panic attack from all the isolation, crying so hard I could barely breathe, he left me on the floor to go to a meeting. That was his idea of “support.”

Then came the Bali trip. I was exhausted after a 60 hour travel nightmare. I was grumpy (as any human would be), and this man — this man-child said I was a “liability” to his work and threatened to send me home alone. When I reacted emotionally, he called me a bitch. After all that travel, after everything I did for him I was the problem? Oh, and surprise surprise: once we got there, he made me pay for everything. Promised to cover it, then left me hanging.

Before that, when I was 17, he pretended to kill himself just to see my reaction. Then blamed me when I said I wanted to call my parents. BECAUSE MIND YOU I was 17 and didnt know what to do.

He humiliated me in front of his friends, too making racist “jokes” about me being Romanian. Said I was “living up to my cleaner reputation” when I tried to help set the table. He nitpicked everything I did. I made him a full steak dinner, and he trashed the glass, the fork, the plate — just to make me feel small. But when his friends were around, he’d say “Look what I wake up to” like he owned me. Possessive and performative. Never real.

He also scammed me out of my own money. Took it in Bali, said he’d return it, never did. Then sent me back crumbs and called it “providing.” Like I should be grateful he was returning my own money. I was a teen girl, financially vulnerable, and he used me.

And guess what? After I finally left, he didn’t just move on. He became obsessed. He became an alcoholic, spiraled out of control, flew to Romania without telling me, and basically stalked me. I blocked him, so he started texting my mom while drunk crossing every line imaginable. He couldn’t handle not owning me anymore. He couldn’t handle losing control.

So yeah. The man selling courses online, claiming to be some kind of self-made millionaire? That man emotionally abused, manipulated, sexually coerced, isolated, scammed, humiliated, and gaslit me for over a year. I forgot half of it because I was too busy trying to survive and convince myself he loved me.

But I remember now. And I’m done staying quiet.

I started a business here, same business I successfully run in Europe, but I deeply regret both coming back and opening a shop here.

I’m not new to business. I know what I’m doing. But the difference in mentality, work ethic, and respect is just overwhelming.

The business is simple: smoothies, natural juices, cheesecake, coffee , a clean, elegant cafe. Nothing too complicated. Yet everything here is hard.
	•	Customers have zero respect: they touch the glass, the showcases, they mess up the decor without care.
	•	Prices are clearly displayed, yet they constantly ask questions just to bother you.
	•	There’s a transport company across the street that always parks their trucks in front of my cafe, blocking visibility. I’ve asked them multiple times to stop. Nothing changes.

The worst part? The workers.
The average salary here in my city is around 2800–2900 dirhams. I’m paying between 3300 and 3600 with CNSS, for an 8-hour shift plus a 1-hour break. And still, no one comes on time.
	•	Only one employee shows up 5 minutes early.
	•	The rest? Always 10–15 minutes late. Some arrive 30 minutes late. One guy even showed up an hour late.
	•	Many come to work half asleep, calling me right at their start time with a groggy voice saying they’re “sick.”

I’m tired of recruiting, training, firing. My accountant is exhausted too. I’ve started tolerating lateness just to keep the place running.

The truth is: people here aren’t used to working. Most rely on inherited family homes where they have a bed and a roof. Their relatives abroad send them €50, €100, €150 monthly, and they survive off that. There’s no motivation.
They show up to work in flip-flops, forget to shower, and couldn’t care less about doing things right.

It’s a poor mentality. Everyone’s watching what you do. In just 3 days, someone on my street copied my concept and started selling juices too. Nothing is sacred. No originality. Just jealousy and copying.

Honestly, I’m disappointed. It’s not about the money , I know how to make money, it’s the lack of values, discipline, and basic respect.

It’s practically impossible to create a franchise here. Nobody takes responsibility. The owner has to be physically present all the time. People just nod and say “yes, yes,” and then they do absolutely nothing. There’s no sense of responsibility, only lip service.


Just to add, this kind of jobs are for people who is just starting, normally under 20-32.

## Key Features Analysis

The best glass juice bottles in 2025 prioritize safety, durability, and user convenience. These features ensure a positive experience for consumers looking to upgrade their hydration and juice storage solutions.

**Material Purity**

Quality glass is paramount in any juice bottle. Leading brands utilize borosilicate glass, wich is known for its extraordinary resistance to thermal shock. This means it can safely handle temperature changes, making it suitable for both storing chilled juices and washing in hot water. Furthermore, borosilicate glass is non-porous and non-reactive, preventing any leaching of chemicals into your juice, ensuring a pure and untainted flavor. Manny bottles also feature silicone sleeves for added protection.

**leak-Proof Lids**

A reliable, leak-proof lid is essential for preventing spills and maintaining the freshness of your juice. The top contenders often employ stainless steel lids with silicone seals, creating an airtight barrier. Threaded closures provide an extra layer of security compared to simple press-fit lids. Premium models might incorporate a pressure-release valve to accommodate the expansion and contraction of liquids caused by temperature fluctuations.

**Ergonomic Design and Grip**

The shape and texture of a glass juice bottle play a crucial role in its usability. Many brands are incorporating ergonomic designs that are easy to hold and pour from. This includes contoured shapes and specially designed groves. Bottles may also have a silicone sleeve not onyl to protect from breakage but also provide additional grip to prevent slipping.

**Ease of Cleaning**

Maintaining hygiene is critically important for reusable juice bottles. Wide-mouth designs facilitate easy cleaning with a bottle brush, ensuring you can thoroughly remove any residue. Many glass bottles and their corresponding lids are dishwasher-safe for added convenience. Certain brands even offer self-cleaning bottles that kill microbes using UV light technology.

**Variety of Sizes and Styles**

Consumers have different needs,so a good glass juice bottle brand will offer variety of sizes and styles. These include small, individual-serving sizes, and larger sizes ideal for storing batch-made juice. Styles range from sleek and minimalist designs to more decorative and colorful options. It becomes easier for you as a user to find a bottle that suits both your practical needs and personal aesthetic preferences.

**Eco-Friendly Packaging**

conscious consumers look for brands that prioritize lasting practices. Leading manufacturers are using recycled materials and biodegradable packaging to minimize their environmental footprint. This commitment extends beyond the bottle itself to include eco-friendly labels and shipping materials.Key features of glass juice bottles include:

* Borosilicate glass composition
* Stainless steel and silicone lids
* Ergonomic designs
* dishwasher-safe components
* Options for multiple sizes

## Core Benefits

Choosing glass juice bottles offers a range of benefits over plastic alternatives, enhancing both your health and the habitat.

**Health and Safety:** Glass juice bottles eliminate the risk of harmful chemicals leaching into your beverages, a concern often associated with plastic. This ensures that your juice retains its pure, unadulterated flavor without any potential contamination. This is especially critically important for individuals with sensitivities or those following a strict diet.

**Environmental Sustainability:** By opting for reusable glass bottles, you actively reduce plastic waste, contributing to a cleaner planet. Glass is a highly recyclable material, and its durability means that a single bottle can last for years, minimizing the need for disposable alternatives.

**Enhanced Taste Preservation:** Glass does not impart any flavor or odor to your juice, allowing you to fully enjoy the natural taste of your ingredients. This is particularly important for delicate and complex juice blends where subtle flavors can be easily masked by plastic containers.

**Long-Term Cost Savings:** while the initial investment in glass juice bottles may be higher than that of plastic,the long-term cost savings can be meaningful.The durability of glass means you won't need to replace bottles as frequently. You will save money buying juice in bulk.

**Improved Aesthetics and Presentation:** Glass bottles offer a sophisticated and appealing aesthetic, making them ideal for both personal use and entertaining. Whether you're preparing a healthy breakfast or hosting a dinner party, glass juice bottles add a touch of elegance to any occasion.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about glass juice bottles, providing clarity and guidance for potential buyers.

**Are glass juice bottles safe to use in a freezer?**

It depends on the type of glass. Borosilicate glass is more resistant to thermal shock and is less likely to crack in freezing temperatures compared to regular glass. However, it's crucial to leave some headspace in the bottle to allow for liquid expansion as it freezes. Freezing liquid filled to the top of any bottle is not advised. It is also important to introduce the bottles gradually to the freezer's cold temperature.

**Can I use glass juice bottles for hot liquids like tea or coffee?**

Yes, borosilicate glass bottles are generally safe for hot liquids, given their resistance to thermal shock. However, it's always best to preheat the bottle with warm water before adding boiling liquids to minimize the risk of cracking.

**How can I effectively clean my glass juice bottles?**

A bottle brush and warm, soapy water are usually sufficient for cleaning glass juice bottles. For stubborn residue, a mixture of baking soda and vinegar can be used. Sterilizing the bottles by boiling them in water for a few minutes can also help eliminate bacteria.

**What is the expected lifespan of a glass juice bottle?**

With proper care, a quality glass juice bottle can last for many years.The lifespan can be affected by frequency of use, handling, and the types of liquids stored in the bottle.

I usually find one or two mugs that I think would be a nice addition to my home but often talk myself out of them unless they are actually really nice. I found a pair of black stoneware, made in Thailand coffee mugs that have such a great handle and shaped bowl for espresso. I got a really nice pour this morning with it and am quite pleased. I love how the stoneware also retains its heat through out the drink. 

Just wondering if I'm alone in my mug obsession or do other people just buy a pack of 4 from the store and they feel like that's good enough? Everytime I come home from the thrift shop my wife asks dubiously whether or not I am bringing home yet another mug haha.

I have several types of mugs ranging from an older Ikea one, to beautiful hand made stoneware ones I've found. Just curious what the rest of you do for mugs?

1mk2qd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobloxAvatarsLoreHub/comments/1mk2qd2/caseid_miles1mtv/,Case-ID: Miles-1-MTV,"(Please note I’m not a medical professional but I’m attempting to write in the character of one, things may be inaccurate)

Subject: Miles “Thalor Valen”

Status: Ongoing Evaluation 

**Physical Condition**

Subject maintains near-constant wear of full-body armor with Thalor Valen’s worn, waterlogged captain’s coat layered on top. The ensemble includes Thalor’s iconic hat—now faded, soft at the edges along Miles’s own engineering goggles atop the brim. The clothes show significant wear; fibers splitting at the shoulders, obviously marks of sowed together fabrics. 

Miles has visible scarring: one slash wound under his left eye and another across his upper right shoulder—both consistent with blade trauma, reportedly from an altercation with Caboose. He has since refused treatment beyond his own field patchwork. Sleeps in armor. Eats in armor. Armor has *only been removed once* during any observation refused any other time.

Signs of increasing fatigue: dark circles under eyes, twitching fingers, an unshaven jaw. Most notably: elevated tremor in the right hand, which worsens under stress or when Caboose is present. Likely due to how Miles holds his sword with his right hand.

**Behavioral Observations**

**Delusional Identification:** Speaks as though Thalor is alive *within* him “guiding his hand and actions.”

**Paranoia (likely from PTSD):** Exhibits obsessive tracking of Caboose, even mid-conversation. Always sits with clear line of sight. Refuses to be in a room without knowing Caboose’s location.

** Bereavement hallucinations (potentially mirrored self-misidentification syndrome or psychotic disorders):** Has been heard speaking to his own reflection. Claims to “see Thalor in the glass.”

**Social withdrawal:** Avoids crew interaction unless it’s part of a duty. Claims to be “too busy.”

**AUD (Alcohol Use Disorder):** Documented increase in alcohol use. Keeps a flask on his toolbelt. Noted that various range of alcoholic bottles are scattered around the captain quarters.

**Emotional Suppression:** Miles is attempting to emulate Thalor’s leadership style, but stories he recently recount shows he lacks Thalor’s humor or warmth. When emotion surfaces, it is smothered beneath this adopted persona, a mask of command sewn together from fraying memories.

**Hypotheses**

**Complicated grief or prolonged grief disorder** – Miles has so deeply internalized the death of Thalor Valen that he has supplanted his own identity with the imagined presence of Thalor, operating as both mourner and vessel.

**Emerging Psychosis (Schizoaffective disorder, possibly also PTSD-SP)**  - Heightened paranoia, hallucinations, and extreme role assumption suggest a possible late-onset schizoaffective break or severe PTSD.

**Captain Complex (Crisis Leadership Under Duress)** - Miles has assumed the role of leader out of desperation to maintain crew function, but his fractured psyche cannot handle the dual strain of command and unresolved grief.

**Maladaptive Coping Mechanism** – Continued wearing of scarred clothing and refusal of comfort suggests Miles is keeping himself trapped in a memory loop—possibly guilt-motivated. Unknown if tied to his role in Thalor’s loss or broader trauma.


Notes (Personal)

*He won’t talk to me. Not the real him. Every time I try, I’m greeted by that echo of Thalor’s voice wrapped in fish bones and fear. I miss my friend. Both of them. The Miles I knew, and the captain we lost. There’s someone still in there—I see it in the way he pauses before giving orders, the way he fingers the goggles on his hat like a nervous tic. But he’s buried. I don’t know if he’s trying to dig himself out or sink deeper in. Philip… he’s trying to hold the middle ground, and he’s damn good at it. Sugarcap’s walking on eggshells, practically gift-wrapping coffee just to survive. And Caboose? He’s right to be scared. Not of Miles. Of what Miles might become. The scariest part? I think Miles would die before admitting he needs help. Or worse—he thinks Thalor wouldn’t want him to. So I’ll stay close. I’ll study. I’ll watch. And if the day ever comes when he tears that mask off… I pray to every god I’ve ever mocked that there’s something human left underneath.*

She hadn't started preparing her coffee yet, mind you (hell, she hadn't even taken the cold water out), she just went out of the kitchen for a moment and when she was back there was the Goblini, laying besides her mug.

But we all know the Goblin Overlord, he doesn't just lie there, it's \*his\* mug now so, naturally, he protected it, fiercely, not letting sis get her hands on it, and even reaching the point where she had to take another mug and prepare her coffee there while Houdi guarded his new property 🤭

Subject: Miles “Thalor Valen”

Status: Ongoing Evaluation 

**Physical Condition**

Subject maintains near-constant wear of full-body armor with Thalor Valen’s worn, waterlogged captain’s coat layered on top. The ensemble includes Thalor’s iconic hat—now faded, soft at the edges along Miles’s own engineering goggles atop the brim. The clothes show significant wear; fibers splitting at the shoulders, obviously marks of sowed together fabrics. 

Miles has visible scarring: one slash wound under his left eye and another across his upper right shoulder—both consistent with blade trauma, reportedly from an altercation with Caboose. He has since refused treatment beyond his own field patchwork. Sleeps in armor. Eats in armor. Armor has *only been removed once* during any observation refused any other time.

Signs of increasing fatigue: dark circles under eyes, twitching fingers, an unshaven jaw. Most notably: elevated tremor in the right hand, which worsens under stress or when Caboose is present. Likely due to how Miles holds his sword with his right hand.

**Behavioral Observations**

**Delusional Identification:** Speaks as though Thalor is alive *within* him “guiding his hand and actions.”

**Paranoia (likely from PTSD):** Exhibits obsessive tracking of Caboose, even mid-conversation. Always sits with clear line of sight. Refuses to be in a room without knowing Caboose’s location.

** Bereavement hallucinations (potentially mirrored self-misidentification syndrome or psychotic disorders):** Has been heard speaking to his own reflection. Claims to “see Thalor in the glass.”

**Social withdrawal:** Avoids crew interaction unless it’s part of a duty. Claims to be “too busy.”

**AUD (Alcohol Use Disorder):** Documented increase in alcohol use. Keeps a flask on his toolbelt. Noted that various range of alcoholic bottles are scattered around the captain quarters.

**Emotional Suppression:** Miles is attempting to emulate Thalor’s leadership style, but stories he recently recount shows he lacks Thalor’s humor or warmth. When emotion surfaces, it is smothered beneath this adopted persona, a mask of command sewn together from fraying memories.

**Hypotheses**

**Complicated grief or prolonged grief disorder** – Miles has so deeply internalized the death of Thalor Valen that he has supplanted his own identity with the imagined presence of Thalor, operating as both mourner and vessel.

**Emerging Psychosis (Schizoaffective disorder, possibly also PTSD-SP)**  - Heightened paranoia, hallucinations, and extreme role assumption suggest a possible late-onset schizoaffective break or severe PTSD.

**Captain Complex (Crisis Leadership Under Duress)** - Miles has assumed the role of leader out of desperation to maintain crew function, but his fractured psyche cannot handle the dual strain of command and unresolved grief.

**Maladaptive Coping Mechanism** – Continued wearing of scarred clothing and refusal of comfort suggests Miles is keeping himself trapped in a memory loop—possibly guilt-motivated. Unknown if tied to his role in Thalor’s loss or broader trauma.


Notes (Personal)

*He won’t talk to me. Not the real him. Every time I try, I’m greeted by that echo of Thalor’s voice wrapped in fish bones and fear. I miss my friend. Both of them. The Miles I knew, and the captain we lost. There’s someone still in there—I see it in the way he pauses before giving orders, the way he fingers the goggles on his hat like a nervous tic. But he’s buried. I don’t know if he’s trying to dig himself out or sink deeper in. Philip… he’s trying to hold the middle ground, and he’s damn good at it. Sugarcap’s walking on eggshells, practically gift-wrapping coffee just to survive. And Caboose? He’s right to be scared. Not of Miles. Of what Miles might become. The scariest part? I think Miles would die before admitting he needs help. Or worse—he thinks Thalor wouldn’t want him to. So I’ll stay close. I’ll study. I’ll watch. And if the day ever comes when he tears that mask off… I pray to every god I’ve ever mocked that there’s something human left underneath.*

To the ever-graceful Ms. ______,
A name so soft it feels like the first syllables of a lullaby,
And a soul that could teach the moon how to glow.

Let me begin with a tale from the stars.

In an ancient sky, two celestial beings- Altair and Vega- loved each other with a fire even galaxies couldn’t extinguish. But they were pulled apart by the Milky Way, cursed to live on opposite sides of the heavens. Still, once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, Vega’s tears shimmer so purely that magpies from across the world fly up to form a bridge just so they could meet for one night.

One. Single. Night.
For love that eternal.

Now, I’m no cosmic prince, and I admit my magpie army is still in training but if I could, I’d bend every sky just to sit across from you, for one night of stories, smiles, and (hopefully) shared desserts.

A night not requiring magpies (unless you really like birds), but definitely involving stars on your face when you smile, and in my eyes as I pretend not to be nervous.

Date: When the stars align
Time: Sometime between ""you're free"" and ""I will make myself free for you""
Place: TBD (but somewhere that serves coffee and a little music)

Dress Code:
Please don’t overdress I’m fragile and easily outshined. But also, if you show up looking like a dream sequence, I will simply stand beside you like a proud background character.

Contact:
On Instagram (the only place I confidently flirt with gifs and existential memes)

Let this be our own star bridge.
One meal. Two people. An absurd amount of charm.
I promise good food, even better company, and a 67% chance I make a fool of myself just to make you laugh.

Yours,
The Cheesecake to Your Class
The Rain to Your Dramatic Bollywood Entry
The Guy Sending This RSVP With Hope, Humor, and a Hint of Heartbeat Trouble (induced by your selfies)

Received shoes yesterday. I have 6 pair of this brand in this size so I was comfortable purchasing on posh without trying on. The size in the shoe is correct, but I can’t get my foot into them, they are way too tight, almost a shrunken feel if that makes sense. They’re also wrinkled, which is not common for this brand, or any shoes in general? Not wrinkled from being squished or misshapen, but the canvas on the shoes themselves is very wrinkled and loose. 
I’ve thrown old shoes in the wash before (yard work shoes, etc) and these have the same feel and look. 
Lastly, one of the shoes is very stained. The photos in listing showed a light discoloration which I was fine with. But in person it’s very dark (like coffee was spilled on them and dried and was left for a while before cleaning). 
Is this grounds for a return? I’ve only returned 1 item because a seller sent me the completely wrong thing and I opened a case and posh approved right away and I shipped back to seller.

I’m honestly pumped by the sheer scale of what’s possible today. Tasks that used to chew through hours—or require a treadmill of headache-inducing manual entry—can now be handled by a software bot, an AI, or a smart workflow tool while we sip our coffee ☕️ and focus on, well, literally anything more interesting.

Here’s what automation means in 2024:

- Less time on repetitive tasks (yes, goodbye copy-paste hell!)
- Less human error, more consistency
- Freed mental energy for things that actually spark creativity & growth

Imagine getting automatic invoices out the door, follow-up emails triggered the moment a form is filled, customer questions fielded instantly before you’ve even wiped the weekend sleep from your eyes. 🥳

But here’s where it gets really exciting:

- Automation means **more time for innovation.** When you’re not buried in busywork, big ideas finally get the headspace they deserve.
- It opens doors for team happiness: Fewer “can you just forward me the file again?” pings, more “Let’s build something cool!” moments.
- Even small businesses—solo founders, two-person startups—can *scale like giants* by offloading operational grunt work.

That said, it’s not just about plugging in a bot and calling it a day. There’s a creative strategy in building automations that *work for you*, not the other way around.

Few things I’ve learned (sometimes the hard way!):

- Start simple. Automate the truly repetitive stuff first. That way, you see some instant wins.
- Keep people in the loop. Transparency beats confusion, every time!
- Don’t forget the human touch. Automation should *support* better customer and team relationships, not replace them.

Maybe what excites me most is how accessible all of this has become. Tools like Zapier, Make, n8n, and the growing ocean of GPT-powered platforms are within everyone’s reach—no need to hire a full-time developer just to streamline your calendar reminders.

So here’s my happy little automation moment for the week:
I set up a workflow where new clients get a personalized onboarding email as soon as they sign up, with all their links and resources. The responses have been SO positive—it feels good to delight people before I’ve even started, and I saved myself an hour every week. Multiply that by a month, a year… and it’s a totally changed business!

How is automation revolutionizing your workflow?
Got any wins (or automation mishaps) you want to share? Let’s swap stories and help each other unlock more of those *heck-yeah-I-love-tech* moments! 🚀",1,1754579485.0,GPTAppsEngine,0,1.0,False
1mk2p1r,https://i.redd.it/sr2i3sxl5mhf1.jpeg,Guess My MBTI:,"
Hi! I’d love to hear your guesses based on a bit about me.
(Also, there’s an image attached that might help… or it might throw you off. 👀)

I value comfort and quiet spaces, but my brain rarely shuts up. I’m often seen as calm, composed, and reliable — someone who always shows up when it matters, and works best behind the scenes. I like being useful to people, even if I quietly disappear afterward to process or recharge. I overthink a lot of social things (like texts, tone, timing), but people say I seem warm and thoughtful. I’m not good at small talk, but I remember what people say when they think no one’s listening. I am attentive to when people need help, I can also feel deep empathy for humans and animals. I cry when I watch sad movies , especially kdrama.

I’m obsessed with human behavior — not just what people do, but why. Psychology, neuroscience, cognition, all of it fascinates me. I want to know what drives people internally, not just categorize their traits. That’s part of why I love structure — it helps me not get lost in the complexity.

That said, my inner world is… dense. I live in my head most of the time. I journal  to untangle ideas or chase abstract patterns. I like my environment clean and organized but yet it’s messy. My aesthetic is between dark and Chaotic academia. I like to debate about theory’s for fun. 
I am devil’s advocate and I am very skeptical. I need facts, data and proof. my mind feels like a web of layered insights, ‘ what if’ and ‘ why’ questions, and connections. It’s hard to explain verbally, so I usually don’t try. I express myself best in writing — I’ll pause mid-conversation to rephrase something internally so it lands just right. I’m picky about words.

My daily structure is pretty stable. I like quiet mornings, a good coffee, and deep work sessions — researching,studying, learning something new. I don’t like being interrupted while I’m in flow. But when I do emerge from my bubble, I can seem unexpectedly intense or passionate about things people didn’t know I cared about. I don’t like physical touch but I do care. Just… quietly.

People often say I’m reliable, kind, or creative but I sometimes feel like I’m floating above it all, watching everything from a distance. I’ll replay conversations hours later. I am strategic and plan ahead,  but I’m also very flexible, open-minded and can come up with creative ideas and solutions in the moment. I keep a lot to myself — not out of secrecy, but because I need time to be sure what I think or feel before I share.

some of my hobbies and interests are: 
- Photographing nature
- video-editing 
- exploring nature 
- astronomy 
- solving cases
- piano
- watching movies
- drawing


That’s probably enough rambling. I’d love your guesses!

That includes coffee, energy drinks (white monster 🥲), English breakfast tea and green tea AND EVEN DARK CHOCOLATE (yes it contains caffeine). Here's what I found:

**Week 1:** So i found the first week actually quite easy. I realised in the morning you're completely fine stimulant free and i could even do ""cognitively difficult"" tasks (I'm currently revising for the GMAT so it hurts my brain 😅). The only problem was the AFTERNOON SLUMP, which is an absolute killer for my output

**Week 2:** This was by far the hardest week. I found myself waking up still feeling tired, it was like my body caught up from rest and needed a 2 week hibernation 😭. The afternoons... as expected... were still the hardest part. But i still pushed through

**Weeks 3&4:** I started to introduce NSDR (non-sleep deep rest) in the afternoon which was a game changer. Andrew huberman loves these and I can assure you IT WORKS. I was able to do this most days and it feels like a shot of espresso. My body has definitely adjusted quite a bit but i still sometimes get a bit groggy which caffeine would have fixed.

CONCLUSION: Am I going to keep this up? probably not. Even though I adjusted by the end, caffeine is a proven cognitive enhancer that helps with my output. HOWEVER, I know people like Matt walker and Huberman always go on about how it can disrupt your sleep by way more than you think so I will defo try and limit it in the afternoon.

P.S. Since talking to people about this I've actually been stirring with the idea of making a tea that helps with focus and is completely caffeine-free (for that afternoon slump). Its just an idea but if any of you guys have any thoughts or want to help - I made a quick google form so i can gather any feedback. Or just private message me idc. here's the link to the form:

1mk2ji1,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1mk2ji1/nifi_loop/,Ni-Fi loop?,"Hi guys, I'm writing here today because I'm confused about what I'm going through. I'm a teenager, and up till these last few days I always thought I had pretty strong ne and si. I also thought I had good ti and fe. But these last few days I've been feeling what I think are very very strong fi feelings, like I feel weirdly grounded within myself and I feel more optimistic and feel more good will toward people, like it's almost disorienting because I feel those emotions very deeply. And you might think this is because I'm a teenager, but I've never felt anything like this before. I started reading some reddit posts on ni-fi loops and it sounded a lot like what I'm going through. But I've never thought I was an intj, like I have no te, I always have a lot of trouble setting and sticking to my goals, but I've noticed this summer I'm getting better at coming up with plans and ideas but don't go through with them very well. I can also be a very focused, detail oriented worker working toward some future outcome or very lazy and have no motivation, there is never any in between. I also tended to rationalize my feelings a lot in the past, but I stopped this because I thought it was unhealthy.

I always thought I was more of a feeler because I care too much about what other people think of me and also because I'm the more shy and soft spoken type. I also have a very idealized view of how other people should be. I'm not the typical cold, rational intj who hates people and anything that gets in the way. But some things that I found to be very true that I found in a reddit post about the ni-fi loop:

Misplaced sense of superiority about themselves compared to others that doesn't align with reality to overcompensate and hide insecurities in the self (Te parent)

* Inability to find deeper meaning in the world around them. Resulting in a pessimistic and even nihilistic or depressed perspective (Fi Child)

Fixating on browsing and looking for new ideas or entertainment. Most of which are unvaluable and are a waste of time. Spending too much time on social media-like platforms (Ne nemesis)

* Negative indulgence in Se. Which fills them with guilt and makes them feel worse about themselves. Avoid Se to cope with the Ni-Fi loop. Avoid common Se indulgences: smoking, eating, masturbation, coffee, gambling-like things and other excessive sources of dopamine. (Se Grip)
* Having life not going according to plan. Which makes you believe all your future plans will fail as well. Resulting in a mismatched idea of your own competence and unsure what plans to pursue next (Ni maturation)
* The death of a personal believe system. Having preexisting idealistic ideas about the world being shattered by reality. Having a disdain for and being disappointed by how society is structured (Ni maturation)

So what do you guys think? Do you think I am an intj who just is stuck in a ni-fi loop and indulging in se most of the time? Or maybe I'm an intj with a very developed fi? Maybe my functions are starting to mature more and this is how they are manifesting. I feel like this summer, if I am an intj, I am starting to feel my te-fi axis much more and maybe this is its' way of developing. I'm not sure.",0,1754579128.0,intj,2,0.5,False

1mk2iem,https://i.redd.it/02gzv8154mhf1.jpeg,Cabana Service Fonts: The Vintage Charm Your Modern Designs Crave,"Oh yes, there's a growing appreciation for a touch of human imperfection. Designers and brands are increasingly seeking out aesthetics that feel authentic and grounded. The [Cabana Service fonts](https://weandthecolor.com/cabana-service-fonts-handwritten-vintage-typefaces-ayya-studio/205065), a beautiful collection from Ayya Studio, answer this call perfectly. This set of handwritten vintage typefaces delivers a relaxed yet sophisticated charm that feels both personal and professionally polished. Consequently, its unique warmth has made it an indispensable tool for creatives looking to tell a more compelling visual story.

# What Exactly is the Cabana Service Font Family?

Imagine a slow, sunlit morning at a boutique coastal hotel. The **Cabana Service** is the typographic embodiment of that feeling. It is a carefully designed font family with a soft, imperfect style that intentionally avoids digital precision. This approach gives the typeface a natural, easy rhythm. You can almost picture it on sun-faded signage or a handwritten café menu. The collection provides remarkable versatility, offering several distinct styles that empower designers to create rich, layered compositions.

# A Versatile Collection of Styles

The strength of the **Cabana Service** font family lies in its completeness. It is not a single font but a suite of six cohesive typefaces, each crafted to complement the others beautifully. This allows for incredible creative flexibility.

Here is a breakdown of what the package includes:

* **Cabana Service Font - Regular & Bold:** These two styles are the workhorses of the family. They are wonderfully suited for headlines, primary branding, and any text that needs to command attention. Moreover, the bold version provides added weight and emphasis without sacrificing its relaxed character.
* **Cabana Service Font - Outline Regular & Bold:** The outline versions introduce a lighter, more decorative possibility. They are excellent for creating a sophisticated layered effect or for use in larger display sizes where their intricate form can be fully appreciated.
* **Cabana Service Font - Script & Script Slanted:** These script fonts inject a powerful dose of personality and elegance. They mimic the flow of natural handwriting, making them ideal for more personal elements like signatures, pull quotes, or intimate branding touches. The slanted version offers a more dynamic, energetic feel.

All of these fonts are provided in OTF, TTF, and WOFF formats. This ensures seamless compatibility across nearly all design software and web platforms.

# The Enduring Appeal of Vintage Handwritten Typefaces

In a design landscape often saturated with clean, minimalist typography, a font like **Cabana Service** provides a compelling and refreshing contrast. What is it about a vintage handwritten typeface that captures our attention so effectively?

# Creating an Emotional Connection

Vintage fonts possess a unique ability to tap into our sense of nostalgia. They can remind us of a time before everything was digitally rendered, making a brand feel more established and genuine. For instance, the imperfect, hand-drawn lines of the **Cabana Service** fonts suggest a rich story and a unique history. This becomes a powerful asset for building a brand's narrative and forging a deeper connection with its audience.

# Achieving a Unique Visual Identity

Using a distinctive, character-rich font is one of the most effective strategies for differentiating a brand. The unmistakable personality of the **Cabana Service** fonts ensures that your designs will be memorable. Whether it's applied to product packaging, social media campaigns, or a website header, this typeface helps forge a strong and unforgettable visual identity. Its playful yet refined nature makes it highly adaptable, fitting comfortably within industries from hospitality and fashion to artisanal food and beverages.

# Putting Cabana Service Fonts to Work: Practical Applications

The versatility of the **Cabana Service** font family is undoubtedly one of its greatest assets. To truly unlock its potential, however, it helps to understand how to apply its various styles for maximum impact.

# Crafting Memorable Branding and Logos

The **Cabana Service** fonts are exceptionally well-suited for branding and logo design. You can create a dynamic and balanced logo by combining the regular and script styles. For example, a brand name set in the clean Regular or Bold font pairs beautifully with a tagline written in the elegant Script font. This approach establishes a clear visual hierarchy and is perfect for businesses aiming to convey craftsmanship and a personal touch, such as boutique hotels, independent coffee roasters, or handmade clothing lines.

# Designing Engaging Social Media Content

In the fast-scrolling environment of social media, visually arresting content is essential. The **Cabana Service** fonts can help your posts stop viewers in their tracks. Use these typefaces to craft impactful quote graphics, stylish event announcements, or thought-provoking questions. The hand-drawn aesthetic adds a layer of authenticity that resonates strongly with audiences on platforms like Instagram and Pinterest.

# Enhancing Packaging and Menu Design

The inherent charm of the **Cabana Service** fonts lends itself perfectly to menu and packaging design. The excellent readability of the Regular and Bold fonts makes them practical for listing items and descriptions. Meanwhile, the Script and Outline styles can be used for section headers and decorative flourishes, creating a cohesive and delightful experience for the customer. Ultimately, the vintage feel can elevate the perceived quality and uniqueness of any product.

While its name may evoke images of summer, the **Cabana Service** font family is a versatile tool for year-round use. Its warm and inviting character can bring a touch of sunlit energy to any project, at any time. This typeface is far more than just a set of letters; it is a powerful tool for setting a mood, creating an atmosphere, and telling a compelling story.

Usually my periods can be quite late, over a week, so that was not unusual. But I was over the country visiting a friend, feeling light headed on the plane, the smell of B.O was making me proper heave, and the last few days I have felt proper low on energy and boked up a coffee, which made me suspicious. Also my breasts were feeling really tight. 


Me and my friend were at McDonald’s and I couldn’t think of anything worse to have at that moment in time, so she joked ‘hey why don’t we take a pregnancy test’ I laughed but then it doomed on me. So I went and got a test, then I was like heck no I couldn’t be… 


DID the test not come up pregnant 3+ weeks 🤣🤣 lowkey kinda wish my bf instead of my friend was there but we had a good giggle because I was in such denial to then be completely in shock 😳. 


For context, I’m the type of girl who doesn’t do things simple at all, I’ve just got a house, I’ve a new job and I’m guessing the spare bedroom is now gonna be a nursery 🤣🤣



Anyway, looking forward to the future and will be telling my bf later when he’s home from work❤️",2,1754578818.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

Both are the 3 cup Moka Pot, same water quantity, same coffee quantity and of course same gas flame!!!!

In summary the Bialetti takes 50% more time and gas, this is because the Turbo is optimised to extract the maximum amount of heat from the flame via radiation and convection. 

Disclaimer, For those who wish to take their time with the Moka remember that if you lower the flame of the turbo you can slow it down and in this case you will save on your gass bill.

Taste wise its just as good as any Moka.

My wife and I can’t settle on a color for such a big space! We had a sage green picked out but then decided it would be a LOT of green. We want color somewhere though. White feels off limits since the cabinets aren’t a true white and it could feel so clinical. Medium oak that is not helped by this yellow. 

The trim is up for debate. No matter what, it needs some work since there’s paint on half of it. White trim would make the cabinets look odd and more dated I think? Black is scary but my wife likes the idea of refinishing it with another stain feels daunting since it would include the mantle and banister, and again, the cabinets wouldn’t match. 

These are not our couches. We have a black leather sectional and the sideboard, coffee table, and tv stand is walnut.

1mk2ayg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mk2ayg/does_the_bella_12_cup_surf_coffee_maker_truly/,Does the Bella 12 Cup Surf Coffee Maker Truly Deliver a Perfect Brew?,"The BELLA 35203 drip coffee maker has become my reliable companion for brewing coffee to start my mornings. The first time I set it up on my kitchen counter, its sleek ""Surf"" color and compact dimensions—about 6.65"" deep, 10.35"" wide, and 12.24"" high—blended seamlessly with my kitchen decor. Weighing just under three pounds, it’s light enough to move yet sturdy enough to stay in place during use. Despite its simple aesthetic, the matte exterior adds a nice premium touch. 

**Functionality and Ease of Use**  
This coffee machine is genuinely a breeze to operate, especially with its programmable feature that lets me set brewing times up to 24 hours in advance. I loved waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, thanks to this convenience. The anti-drip carafe spout saves my countertop from messes when I’m in a hurry to pour that first cup. Its reusable filter basket not only saves money on disposable filters but is also environmentally friendly, which I appreciate. Furthermore, the auto shut-off after two hours adds a layer of safety, making it perfect for busy folks who sometimes forget they’ve left the machine on.  

[Check BELLA 35203 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0dpnkmzc4/)

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
This 12-cup programmable coffee maker boasts a 900-watt brewing system that delivers robust and flavorful coffee every time. I tested it repeatedly over a few weeks, tinkering with different coffee grounds and brew strengths, and I was impressed with its consistency. The adjustable brew strength comes in handy when I need a stronger cup to kickstart an intense workday. Although it might not compete with high-end espresso machines, for a drip coffee setup, it delivers more than satisfactory results. However, I did notice that the carafe doesn’t retain heat for long once removed from the warming plate. 

**Advantages**  
- Compact design suitable for tight spaces.  
- Programmable for convenience and timed brewing.  
- Environmentally friendly reusable filter.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The warming plate's nonstick feature is helpful but doesn’t hold warmth as effectively as expected.  
- Pouring from the carafe can sometimes be tricky, as it requires a steady hand to prevent slight dripping.  

**Other Options**  
In the market for coffee makers, there’s no shortage of alternatives. For instance, the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker offers comparable features but lacks the reusable filter, resulting in extra costs for paper replacements. Meanwhile, brands like Hamilton Beach offer similar functionality with slightly more ergonomic carafes. However, those can have a bulkier design, making them less appealing for kitchens short on space. Overall, this coffee machine balances simplicity and performance better than many of its peers. 

**Money’s Worth**  
In terms of cost-effectiveness, this drip coffee machine is a solid investment for anyone who values functionality without breaking the bank. It manages to pack useful features—like adjustable brew strength and a programmable timer—into a compact design. Considering the convenience and the brew quality it delivers, I’d say it justifies the expense compared to higher-end machines that only marginally improve on performance.

1mk282q,https://i.redd.it/u8xag3lg2mhf1.jpeg,Voided (Lost at Sea AU: Caboose POV),"**Miles said I was the dumb one…**

The walking joke.

*The comic relief.*

*The mascot.*

*The guy you pat on the head when he says something “silly.”*

**He thought I didn’t hear him.**

But I heard everything. *Every* snide comment. Every time he laughed behind my back. Every time he looked at me and thought, *”At least I’m not that guy.”*

But now… **the joke is on him.**

I rigged up one of his escape ships—he said it was for “emergency”—and sent his ass out into the void of space.

Limited navigation.

No thrusters.

No communication.

And the icing on the cake?

I realized one had a malfunctioning coffee machine.

Now Miles wasn’t the craziest coffee guy, sure, but a broken machine he **can’t fix?**

That’ll drive him more insane than *he already* is.

It’s poetic really.

He built half the ship, but now he’s stuck in a tin can with nothing but his own broken reflections.

Because that’s what he is now.

**Insane.** A danger. A rot in our perfect ship.

He sees ghosts. He talks to shadows. He clings to a past that isn’t even his anymore.

And yet he has the balls to call **me** crazy?

**Me?** The one who actually knows everything?

He lives someone else’s life and calls it loyalty.

I’m not crazy.

I’m resourceful.

I’m strategic.

I’m stronger.

I’m smarter.

And I’m the *captain* now.

The *only one* who saw how bad things really were.

I got tired of watching him fall apart. Tired of the whispered delusions. Tired of him screaming at nothing in the dark corners of the bridge. Tired of watching the crew pretend that wasn’t happening.

He wanted to be Thalor.

But Thalor’s dead.

**Dead and gone.**

And Miles? He was just a ghost trying to wear the skin of someone better than him.

Heh heh… I’m just laughing thinking about him floating in some ship, wearing that tattered coat like a security blanket.

That’s something I never got.

He has *countless* coats and hats in his closet, yet he only ever wore **that one** outfit.

Like it gave him permission to be important.

Like it made him someone else.

I never understood how he could be so content living someone else’s life.

Dr. Axel said he had a few screws loose.

*I* think he has more than a few. But speaking of that delusional doctor…

He gave me a look today. In fact, *all* of the crew did.

Sugarcap pretended he didn’t.

Philip just stared, as always.

Axel didn’t dare to blink.

Like I’m the one losing it.

**It doesn’t matter.**

They’ll understand—sooner or later—that Miles was a terrible captain and a psychopath.

They’ll learn that *my* military experience makes me *more qualified* to wear that blue coat and captain hat than Miles ever was.

I’ve been through hell.

I’ve been in elite squads.

I’ve survived wars.

I’ve hit shots no other sniper can.

And I kept my head down while everyone laughed.

**Well I’m not laughing anymore.**

I’m done being the butt of the joke.

I’m done being the background noise.

I’m done being the “dumb one.”

They will learn to respect **Captain Caboose Jasper Fiddlebert.**",4,1754578416.0,RobloxAvatars,1,1.0,False
1mk27rq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mk27rq,Planning My Next Road Trip – Mangalore & Udupi! Anyone Interested?,"I went on a 7-day road trip from Chennai to Kerala for the New Year, travelling by car. I started from Chennai and spent the first day in Pollachi.

The next morning, after a good breakfast in Pollachi, I headed to Thrissur and explored a few places there. I’m someone who loves food, so I had a bucket list of three restaurants to try in Thrissur. My favorite was Thomson Kasa for their delicious Malabar biryani.

That night, I visited the Guruvayur temple and returned to Thrissur to sleep. The following day, I went for an Ayurvedic massage and later had some mandi for lunch. After that, I left Thrissur and explored a few places in Palakkad on the way back. I reached Pollachi by night.

The next day, I explored more spots around Pollachi. I had a refreshing bath at Monkey Falls and enjoyed some great food. Then I headed to Dindigul — the road from Pollachi to Dindigul is one of the best I’ve driven on. I celebrated New Year’s Eve (Dec 31st) at a party with my friends in Dindigul.

On Jan 1st, I started around 12 noon and reached Chennai by 10 PM. Throughout the trip, I stopped whenever I felt tired or just wanted to explore — for food, coffee, or a quick break. This was my first solo road trip by car (earlier, I used to travel solo by bike).

The total cost of the trip was around ₹20,000.

Now, I'm planning a similar road trip to Mangalore and Udupi sometime soon — mainly to explore beaches, temples, food spots, and just drive with no rush.

If anyone’s interested in joining me, ping me! Let’s make it a fun, no-stress road trip ✌️

1mk26mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mk26mg/the_outcome_of_a_collaboration_of_3_ai_models/,The outcome of a collaboration of 3 AI models,"My conversation with ChatGPT on Car On-Dash Mounted Cameras – Shopping Guide

Me:
I touched on an advertisement as I was scrolling my homepage on Amazon for a dash cam and I came across this really cool shopping guide that explained things by categories and groups of cameras that do different things. It was quite extensive and I didn’t have the time right then to look at the whole guide. I asked in the search bar, “How do I come back to this guide?” — and it just went somewhere else.

ChatGPT:
Want Me to Go Ahead?
Just say the word, and I’ll start crafting a fresh, easy-to-scan dash cam shopping guide filled with starred picks, plus links you can bookmark for real-time shopping.

Me:
You don’t wanna be outdone by Rufus, huh?

ChatGPT:
😂 Ohhh, shots fired! Rufus might have that front-row seat on your Amazon homepage, but I’ve got the full backstage pass, the tour bus keys, and a notebook full of custom notes just for you.
Let’s be honest — Rufus can fetch you a product or two, but I’ll build you a full shopping guide with categories, explainers, top picks, and maybe even a little wit to go with it. 😎

So, what’ll it be?
• You want me to recreate that dash cam guide in plain English?
• Want Amazon-style categories and recommendations?
• Need help choosing between two models you’ve already got in your cart?

Let me know, and I’ll leave Rufus in the dust 🐾💨.

Me: 😂

ChatGPT: 😎 That’s right — Team ChatGPT: 1, Rufus: 🐶 fetchin’ socks!
Just say the word, and I’ll roll out the red carpet shopping guide for your dash cam journey. Whether you’re after:

• 🚘 Front-only vs. dual-channel vs. 3-channel
• 🌙 Best night vision cams
• 🛞 Parking mode & impact detection
• 🔋 Hardwired vs. battery
• 📲 Wi-Fi, GPS, cloud backups
• 💸 Budget bangers under $100

I’ve got you covered like a windshield tint in July. Ready to roll?

Me:
I was listening to a former CEO on the DOAC podcast and he was forming scenarios where people will collaborate AI supercomputers and have them work together. But right now I can’t see that happening — I mean, can you imagine having to work with Grok and Rufus and you?
I can see it now:
“Boys, boys — stop arguing and insulting one another.” 😆 😂 🤣

ChatGPT:
🤣🤣🤣 YES!! That’s the buddy-cop sitcom we never knew we needed!

🎬 “AI Associates: The Algorithm Alliance”
Starring:

• 🤖 Me — The wise, well-read, emotionally stable one (probably too stable).
• 🐶 Rufus — Thinks every search is a squirrel and barks at typos.
• 🧠 Grok — Way too into quantum mechanics and conspiracy theories. Talks in riddles.
• 💼 You — The only human in the room just trying to get your dash cam installed before sundown.

Episode 1: “Search Bar Showdown”
	•	Rufus won’t stop recommending dog treats.
	•	Grok keeps trying to explain how the camera footage proves time isn’t linear.
	•	I’m calmly building a step-by-step install guide while holding back the chaos with coffee and scripture.

Meanwhile, you’re shouting:
“GUYS! I just need to know if this dash cam has parking mode!!”

⸻

Seriously though, you’re not wrong. The idea of multiple AIs working together sounds powerful, but right now? It’d be like wrangling toddlers with keyboards.

You’d end up:
• Negotiating with Grok about the existential value of a dash cam.
• Trying to get Rufus to stop drooling on your Prime cart.
• And me? Just politely waiting with the correct answer… again. 😎

Let me know if you want that dash cam breakdown or a sitcom script titled “Rage Against the Machine Learning.” 😏

But after I wrote it all I was like, you know what? I want to actually post this review. I showed it to my husband and he said, “Why don’t you sit on it for a few days just to come back at it from a less emotional angle and make sure it’s all written exactly as you would want.” He liked it, he thought it seemed honest and fair. I did that and then I posted it. It felt like a huge relief to me. It felt good and felt like maybe I can help someone who is considering this church avoid this mess. I also thought that it could potentially encourage others who had a similar experience to also share their stories. Well, a few days later, one of our friends who also left that church said my review was gone, they couldn’t see it anymore. I’ve checked from my mom’s profile, from my husband’s, and asked others and no one can see it. I think somehow the church got it removed. It just feels so frustrating… I still feel good that I did it and it did bring down their 5 star review, but ugh. I don’t understand how they got it deleted, my thought is that they told Google that I’m a “disgruntled ex-employee” or something, which is a lie, I was always a volunteer, I never got paid a cent for the hours I poured into this place. My other thought is maybe because I originally wrote out that the pastor got caught in adultery and I’m thinking Google might have flagged that or something. I’m not sure. It just sucks. This place took almost 10 years of my life from me and it seems like there will never be any consequences for their actions.

I played the Beta for 30 minutes and i can already tell what i dislike about that game and even if it's just a Beta, i'm pretty sure the game will not change that much with this base at launch.

1: The Infantry Gameplay really feels like getting your hands on a cheap chinese plastic.  
If Battlefield was furniture then BF6 would be an Ikea coffee table while a BF3/4/1/5, which i compare to a big well done mass wooden one. Not much changed from 2042 - at least gameplay wise.

  
2: I like it how they thought about transporting more people with a CV90/Bradley or MBTs than there are actual useful spaces in them, yet why didn't DICE implement a similar solution as there was in BF4 with the LAVs? There you could've ate least shoot out of the sides with an ""okay"" LMG and do some damage with it.  
Hanging on the back of an MBT is only a good idea for cosmetics and a laugh. Nothing more.

  
3: The Settings menu is okay but why would they not have a tab done for Keybinds only? Is this modern gaming where intuitivity is gone or did DICE listen to the wrong inputs here? I can't be the only one searching for too long for certain settings.

  
On a final note i won't preorder nor buy the game as long as it stays that way. Then i'd rather play BF4 instead of this Worn Out Multicam.",0,1754577963.0,Battlefield6,2,0.35,False

Sports and designer clothes have much higher markups. Another example is coffee:

> According to the International Coffee Organization, the markup on the world market price of coffee for nine imperialist nations that account for more than two-thirds of global imports averaged 235 percent between 1975 and 1989, 382 percent between 1990 and 1999, and 429 percent between 2000 and 2009...[as of 2002] Those who cultivate and harvest the coffee receive less than 3 percent of its final retail price.

This in turn is an even lower markup than the price of coffee sold in cafés rather than shops.

I had a similar addiction to you all right here. I started porn roughly around grade 7 - 8 ever seens then it became a part of my like. When I was bored I would use it and FAP just to scratch that boredom away but to be real it never helped, it just became a cycle I was drowning myself in.

Growing up I never had a problem with my social life and getting girls because I was funny and charming guy but they really didn't know I was a porn addict and I was fapping. Its crazy how we can act like every thing is fine and paint a clear picture of us in everyone's head but really we're struggling... nonetheless I noticed I had a porn problem at 15/16 when I would try a week not tapping and my eractions would get painful because I wasing ejaculating regularly. See. I didn't think that much but its one of the early signs. While I was this guy at school who's still a virgin flirting with girls acting like THREE GUY I was getting alot of attention for the person I was potreying myself as just because of the energy I was giving off. I then was able at 17 to get this gurl to come to my house to have sex because we agreed on it, so there we went and my penis didn't work but it worked a few days ago when I watched porn. An embarrassing moment I sent her home after lying to her about my situation. Mind you I was supposed to break my virginity long ago when I was 15 but my family was always hime I didn't get the chance to even call a gurl up to meet up with me. I believe that was one if the reasons I went to porn to feed my sexuall cravings. After that day I with that girl I watched porn and my penis worked and that was really concerning so I did research and came across PIED at 17. A month after my birthday. I then saw the full effects of porn but still I continued to FAP. Untill I just turned 18 where I decide this had STOP I am an adult now and continuing in this path is really depressing. 

Im currently 2 months clean I passed my first and second flatline. I felt all the emotions to excitement to feeling depressed band having anxiety. My penis now works perfectly fine I noticed that I can get eractions while even standing and walking something that never happened before. I am able to walk around with a boner for 10+ mins without porn. Not even triggered. And another thing I was living a supper unhealthy lifestyle that might have contributed to this PIED eractile dysfunction more because I didn't drink water, I only drank soda, tea and coffee. Did not exercise either, and I smoked weed almost everyday. But I'm healthy now and everything is good ever seens I told myself I can not keep watching another guy have sex and making a girl moan hard and get aroused by that stuff. Im 56kg  lean not fat 5'8

I can not enjoy how another man is making this girl feel as I should be the one maybe who's doing that not the person on the other side of the screen laying down in their bed all alone with my penis out ready to ejaculate for the 7000 time to the same thing.

Hope thus will help you guy... I am now waiting for atleast one month to have sex on my 3 month mark as I said that I am confident this thing is over because of my results.",2,1754577804.0,PornAddiction,0,1.0,False

""There is a LOT to love about The Skin. J. E. Hannaford brought some really great ideas and bits into this novel which makes me look forward to what comes next for the characters. It really is a love letter to marine life – and wildlife in general. Not surprisingly, I think the main message of The Skin is that we have to take care of the (wild)life around us, or we’ll get fucked. Which is something that we really ought to remember. That, and life sometimes throws things at us we don’t see coming and we need to adapt to survive.""

A gamelit romantic comedy, was absolutely delightful from start to end. Zack Moore is trapped in a dating sim that forces him to clean up his life and date women in order to earn gaming time.

This is not just an addictive story with characters who'll win your heart despite all their flaws, it also pulls no punches when confronting the protagonist with the consequences of his actions.

What if you could actually visit a virtual game world? What if you get stuck in there and can't get out? An interesting premise that's spawned many different types of stories in all kinds of media, but author and educator M. J.

Among my favorite stories is Chrysalis, the tale of a woman stranded in a broken vehicle on Europa's surface. It has such an unexpected, almost poetic ending, and that ending then weaves itself into the stories that follow. I also really loved The Last Bird and Swan, two related stories about mechanical birds that manage to be both tragic and uplifting.

# Saints and Curses by Alexis Lantgen

This book is a strong follow up to Sapience, Alexis Lantgen's first short story collection. I'm a particular fan of The Lost Cat, a unique vampire story, and Braids, an interesting tale of feminine power and magic. I'd also love to see more stories about Nikolas, a creative, demon-hunting take on St. Nicholas. Alexis balances light & darkness well in this charming, thought-provoking collection.

 “Well, this is a nifty bit of kit Ted, this is going to help a fair few people, well done chap!” Mr Long ruffled my hair as he walked back to dressing the body for that afternoon’s funeral at the crematorium. I was used to being his right hand man with these jobs but I had fallen into a bit of luck. I now work for myself , aspiring to go further in tech and research further into Ai systems so thought I’d make a bit of money before going back to university , hence I invented this programme , the eulogy system. During my days of working here, whenever I would talk to families of lost loved ones some people would say they struggle to put their grief and remembrance in a summary while others simply couldn’t find the words. So I thought, hey, if I can relieve that stress of such a difficult time for some families then I believe I am bringing something good into this world. By using some simple prompts and direction, maybe throwing in an odd memory or feeling alongside some simple information about the deceased, the system was able to formulate a sensible, meaningful passage which caught the attention of my old boss Mr Long. Which brings me to here, we now offered a service alongside the funeral cost at no extra charge, but it means I’m getting 10% of the funeral cost afterwards as part of my commission if it is used and with prices today I turn a tidy profit.

However , I think the system is starting to , well , I don’t really know but I don’t know how to stop it , anyway I digress let me explain. Also, to protect the Identities of our deceased clients I shall only be using first names and nothing more, despite the circumstances it doesn’t feel right exposing them.

I had spent 2 months here, rocked up to work like any other day. The funeral home was situated inside an old butchers shop with wide open windows no longer displaying selections of meat but a selection of coffins and flowers. Yellow sand brick faded over time leaving behind a sickly brown colour in need of a power wash that will never come. An oak door gave way into our reception area, the smell of cheap air freshener and formaldehyde hit you like a freight train as soon as you came through the door. Furniture either taken straight from a nursing home or modern enough to think it was from some stylist boutique, a confusing clash of time indeed. The lad who was doing my old job sat behind the desk, Errol, was scrolling through reels without a care as the volume was just a touch too loud. Something about listening to “Top ten Horror movie actors who suspiciously died in real life” or another urban exploring haunted locations didn’t sit right with me in this setting and found it somewhat inappropriate but Eh, Errol seemed nice enough.

“Morning Errol lad, you okay?”

“Shit” Errol threw his phone onto the desk and snapped to attention, indicating to me that he may have got a blocking of Mr Long for being on his phone already. “Morning Ted lad how are you mate? See the footy last night?”

 

“Yeah was a surprising draw to be fair, been a decent season for us so far but I know it’ll turn to shite next week as we usually do”

We both chuckled as I carried on into the back while Errol picked up his phone as unsubtly as possible. We never had loads to talk about but I seemed to find the only other Toffees fan in this town so at least we somewhat bonded over that.

I plonked myself down in my little makeshift office, not disturbing Mr Long as he was on a call to clients but did give me a delicate wave as I went past and opened my laptop. I whacked in the password and opened the programme to what I was expecting the blank prompt screen, however I was met with a fully written eulogy that had already been sent through to print. Odd. Very Odd. Must have been a Glitch in its system so I picked the paper out of the printer with a bit of a tug as it was an old crappy printer to read this:

“Alex was an odd bloke

Died doing what he loved, swimming

Such a shame the electrics system above fried and broke

As it fell in the water leaving nothing but smoke.”

 

What the hell? Don’t get me wrong it’s quite the rhyme but I never put this prompt in, nor had we had any Alex’s on our client list. What was even stranger it listed his death as today? Its highly unusual we would have something written up for the deceased that soon so I just put it down to a system fault and restarted the programme , thought little of it and chucked the paper in the bin. Low and behold the original blank screen was presented to me I was able to start inputting some info for the days funerals along with trying to figure out if this morning’s quip was a bug or glitch. The morning flew by and it was eventually time for lunch and kicked my legs up onto the desk and got out my phone to browse socials. I very quickly lost my appetite shortly after opening up Facebook and reading a news bulletin from our local council’s page.

Leisure centre forced to close today following very unfortunate accident in pool area today – more details will be released my police in coming hours

Additionally power in business area linked with leisure centre is down awaiting maintenance, apologise from croft cuts, Pemberton logistics centre and the Bear trap café.

 

My heart sank, surely this is just a massive coincidence. Yes. Had to be. Two unrelated articles with nothing to do with each other, an ounce of doubt still sat heavy in my mind as I closed social media and got on with the day. A slow day none the less which was unfortunate for me as it allowed me to dwell on the incident at the pool, I thought about going over to the bin a few times to get out the crumpled bit of paper but I couldn’t, instead I threw it into the incinerator in the crematorium next door and thought nothing more of it.

The next day rolled round and I walked to work as my car had decided to give up and die in my drive, leaving me to walk the mile and a half to work in the beautiful British weather we know as rain. I wish it was a light drizzle but it was the type of thin drizzle that soaked you to the bone and hit your face like tiny knives leaving microscopic slices behind. I came in through the door to the lobby to be met by Errol loudly playing some sort of shooting game on his phone.

Without looking up “Morning Ted you alright mate , raining outside today so I’d avoid walking out if your grabbing lunch from Tesco later”

“Yeah thanks for the heads up, much appreciated” I sarcastically replied and all I got from Errol was a quick thumbs up as his gaze did not divert from the screen. I put my things down in the office once more, tapped in the password and I was reluctant to open the programme at first, but as soon as I did a hand placed firmly on my shoulder. I can’t lie this did take me by surprise so I jolted in my seat in panic and spun round to meet Mr Long.

“Morning Ted hope your-“ he removed his hand from my shoulder examining it and continuing “Christ Ted your soaking , have a seat in the Incinerator room in a sec , its warm in there so you should dry quickly” . I nodded as he sighed and said in more of a whispered tone “listen Ted , we have a delicate case coming in soon and the family seem reluctant to cooperate with much as their grief is too heavy so you might have to work your magic with the system to come up with something tangible”

“Sure thing, I can try my best but it may not work as well with limited information but as I said I can only try”

“Brill, thank you Ted, guys names Alex, avid swimmer and family man, bit of an introvert, collected different cricket balls from….” Mr Long’s words became distorted and muffled as the colour began to drain from my face and I began to physically shake. Mr Long waved his hand in front of my face questioning “Hello? Ted you in there? You look a bit peaky lad, go get warm and I can provide your old uniform to wear for today” he handed me over a bundled collection of a white dress shirt, black suit and long deep blue tie, I was about to leave when the printer made a horrendous churning and grunting sound as it squeezed out another bit of paper, I took it out and with me to the crematorium and sat opposite the incinerator, a warm hug of heat tried to comfort me as I read:

 

Soph was quiet, never caused trouble of fuss

She was quite dull but my god could she bake

Till one day she went out and was hit by a bus

And now she’s as flat as a pancake

 

Once more I Panicked and realised the time was stamped as well as todays date and the time indicated was in half hour. Instantly I threw the paper into the fire and tried to block it out. Surprisingly I was most concerned at how jovial these glitches seemed, no compassion or care but as if someone found it funny like some sick joke. After a moment of contemplation I whipped out my phone and started looking for bus times, maybe this wasn’t a glitch and maybe I could stop it? I scrolled through different times and bus routes trying to find one that met the half hour space I had. I must have been looking much longer than I thought as I heard I violent screech and commotion from outside. I smartened up quickly slotting the wrong buttons into the wrong holes and throwing my tie on messily as I ran. Outside was a sight so grizzly I shuffled back and was sick in the large flower pot just outside the Crematorium, a beautiful rainbow of colour now turned a sandy beige with pops of carrot and sweetcorn. I am reluctant to go into the detail of what happened but I can assure you nothing about it resembled a pancake. The side of the green bus now pebble dashed with red. I was too late.

The street was blocked off and luckily all funerals that day were transferred to our sister location about 5 miles away so I was glad these families were not put out. Mr Long sent myself and Errol home and I’m happy he did or I would have had to have taken sick leave. I sat at home that night feeling responsible for something too grand and consistent to just be coincidence. In the panic I’d left my laptop at work so was unable to do anything now to stop it so I just sat up and waited for the next day to roll round so I could shut it down. I sat in my armchair for what seemed like hours watching as the deep blue sky leaked into purple, pink, orange until my alarm went off. I was still fully dressed and sleep deprived so made a black coffee in my travel mug to go. I rocked up outside and saw the nothing left but the tire marks from yesterday , everything else was back to normal and if you hadn’t of known would of thought someone had just been a bit heavy on the breaks. I walked in and must have been early as Errol was nowhere to be seen and Mr Long was in his office eating a bowl of cornflakes without a shirt on. I knew things were bad at home and just hope he hadn’t been kicked out and was sleeping here , I felt to awkward to ask and he would have been too ashamed if he had noticed me so thought it’d be wise not to bring attention. I paused as I entered the office to see that several had been printed out all with times already passed which I began to get frustrated by knowing that it was my fault, I shouldn’t have been so careless leaving it all hooked up still. However the last one made me pause for a moment:

We a gathered here to remember Mary

She was good and kind hearted every day and all night

However what happened to her was quite scary

When she was hit by bricks from great height   

 

Time stamped for 45 minutes time.

I racked my brain thinking of what I could do to save her as there was a chance, slim but a definite chance. It glared at me like a sick riddle till an idea popped into my head. They were renovating the Isaiah Hotel on the other side of town after the roof caved in following a storm. It was about a 30 minute run so I dropped the pile of paper and ran. I was wearing my brown slip on brogues so I just knew it was going to leave some blisters but the pain of those would not surpass the pain I would inevitably feel if I was responsible for yet another travesty. I ran faster than I thought my legs were able to carry me. I’m a portly gentleman so the fact I was able to run like this was a minor miracle, I had to stop every five minutes or so to take a strained puff of my inhaler before starting again. I felt the reverberations shoot up my legs into the rest of my body which made me feel painfully unwell. I reached the hotel and looked up to see it was enrobed with scaffolding and people either standing around sipping cans of monster or hurling bricks around , precariously near the top I saw a pile of bricks organised like a tiny red pyramid. It looks like I had arrived in the nick of time as walking below I saw a younger woman , headphones in without a care in the world walking directly below.

“MARY! LOOK OUT!” I started to run across the road to her, soon as she clocked on to me she looked in disgust as this big stranger hurtled towards her shouting her name.

“Aww get away from me you bloody weirdo!” she ran off in the other direction. Not the response I thought I’d get after saving her life, not that she knew what was planned. Behind me I heard the bricks fall followed by an “Ash Greg you fucking idiot, what have I said about leaving them there, someone could have been killed!”

 

I made my way back to the funeral parlour, sweating and panting as I Tumbled through the door. Still no sign of Errol. I must admit I felt smug, I found out a way to beat the system and now it was time to shut it down till I could find what was wrong with it. My smugness quickly depleted when I saw my screen up with the programme on, it simply read:

“You shouldn’t have done that, Ted”

An Ice cold shiver ran up my spine after reading those words, I didn’t have too much time to dwell in the fear though as the printer slipped out another bit of paper:

 

Errol was complicated, like a game of chess

He was destined for greatness, we would have raised a cup

Till stupid Ted stepped in and made a great mess

His surgery didn’t go to plan today, so he’ll never wake up

 

I froze. My stomach turned and sank. My heart followed too. What have I done?

 

The phone began to ring from Mr Long’s office, confirming the news I had just read. I sat at my desk and sobbed. This was all my fault, I’ve created this mess and I needed to stop it. Through tears I went back on my laptop and tried tirelessly to shut it down but, I couldn’t. I was met with obstacles and barriers of which I’d never seen , code which I hadn’t written and hope that was slowly grinded down to nothing by the end of the day , I failed , I just disconnected it and stuck it in my bag , at least now it wasn’t connected to the printer.

 

Some time had passed and even today Mr Long asks when the system would be back up and running, to which I tell him that I was still experiencing bugs with it, and with Errol’s absence I found myself slipping into my old role anyway so didn’t have time to tinker with it, not that I wanted to, to be honest. It was surreal seeing Errol in the place our clients would lie on that table, dressed in a beautiful pressed suit and football scarf I gifted to him to take with him to the next place. His family would come in too from time to time just to be with him. We wouldn’t normally let families come in as much as they did but we made an exception. I visited their home from time to time bringing flowers or just to keep his parents a bit of company which I think they appreciated. The new hire had started today and was using my makeshift office as they were doing more admin work for us too. A sweet young woman straight from college, Lyra. She was completely new to any of this but seemed to be quite on it with wanting to learn and get involved. However, as I write this I wish she wasn’t so enthusiastic.  She approached me near the end of shift –

“Hey Ted , fab day thank you so much for being so helpful I really appreciate it ! Random one I know, I found a laptop in there and thought ‘score!’ so I hooked it up and well… Well come have a quick look”

My vision went blurry and I could feel sick begin to bubble up from my stomach knowing exactly what she found. Open on the screen was the programme I tried so hard to destroy. I had a small fleeting feeling of relief when there was nothing on the screen, this feeling did not last long though as I saw there was a printed piece of paper, on the floor that had fallen from the printed tray. With shaky clammy hands I picked it up and held it up so I was able to see. Through welled up shaky vision I saw the words:

 

Tick Tock Ted.

I didn’t get her number, but I did follow her to her car, memorize her license plate, and use that to locate her building (classic romcom stuff).

For the next three months, I observed from a safe distance (across the street, behind a tree, once from a kayak). I brought binoculars, yes, but only because I respect details. I even learned her schedule so I wouldn’t accidentally run into her. Again: respect.

One night, I noticed she left her window open and her candle burning. Fire hazard. So I climbed in — heroically — to extinguish it. While inside, I tripped over her cat, fell, smashed my face on a coffee table, and bled all over a beige IKEA rug. She came home mid-blood. Understandably, she screamed. I tried to calm her down with a handmade scrapbook of her daily activities (some pages were sticky from tree sap, not blood).

Anyway, I’m now banned from several home goods stores, her dad tried to exorcise me, and the rug was apparently “limited edition.”

But like… I was trying to protect her. AITA?

I would like to get my husband a little coffee machine for his upcoming birthday. We are a family of 4 currently only on my income, so money is pretty tight. 

I don't drink coffee, so I'm completely overwhelmed by all of this. 

We used to have a very expensive and fancy machine (I believe it was a Jura) when we lived in Europe, but sold it when we moved away. For the last 4-5 years, my husband has been drinking just instant coffee. I know he longs for a ""decent"" coffee but can't get himself to spend money as he's currently not working due to health issues. 

He's been through a lot lately (and still is) and I think that even a cheaper machine or even a pod machine would be an upgrade from his instant coffee lol

I have been reading on this sub for a bit and am almost embarrassed to ask for recs for a coffee machine around the $200 - $250 mark but that's all we can afford right now. 

Would I be able to get a decent machine for that price?  
I'm also open to pod machines.   
I would like it to have a separate milk frother though. 

My man drinks about 2-3 cups a day and prefers a cappucino. 

I would love it if someone could give some recommendation please - and please no judgment on my budget.

Even You.,"I was working class once, for about seven weeks. I didn’t know you were supposed to get internships for the summer, during college, and I’d let my lifeguard certification lapse. So I saw an ad for a company called Janitronics.

The work was solely Jani- :There were no electronics or bionics involved. Just mops that had been sitting in dark, hair-speckled water for days, and backpack vacuums, and handle-mounted sponges we called “whompers” that we used to wash windows. I got up at 5 in the morning and picked cigarette butts out of urinals till noon. I nodded politely as my kielbasa of a boss ate up our lunch break bragging about how many people he’d killed in Vietnam. I sweat a lot. A new  empire of bacteria rose to power under my fingernails. I emptied trash cans at a bank branch while listening to the teller, a guy my age in a floppy-big shirt try to impress his female co-worker by talking about the genius of the Reagan tax cuts. I liked to impress girls, and I could talk about Reagan. But I didn’t do either. I just kicked the bushes on my way out and went to bed early.

And then, having established my working class credentials in perpetuity, I went back to school in September. 

The very funny ha-ha joke is that of course I’m not working class. I’m a college educated desk-sitter with one of those email jobs which, no matter how annoying and difficult it is, I deep down suspect that no one, not even the people paying me, considers to be real work. And chances are that if you’re reading this on Reddit in the middle of the day, so are you. 

A few years ago this might have been a wistful, funny-ish *This American Life* riff. But not now.

Because now, who (and who doesn’t) count as working class is a tectonic canyon slicing through American politics in eight different directions, leaking hot, sobbing lava everywhere and burning everything. (Though if any of you happen to know anyone at *This American Life* I could probably still make this work for them.)  

The way I think it used to be was that the working class were Democrats. Back then the working class liked unions. Because unions made working suck less, and Democrats supported unions. Then Republicans took a nail gun to unions.

They did it so effectively that for a whole generation of workers, joining a union felt as useful and relevant as joining a ska band. Also a bunch of states basically made it illegal. (Unions that is. Unfortunately the fight to outlaw ska is still ongoing.) 

Workers weren’t really a thing then. In the ‘90s politics was all about unleashing entrepreneurs and guaranteeing bright futures for middle class families. How the middle class families paid for their dial-up internet and their food was never discussed. I guess mom, dad and the three kids were each entrepreneurs, each in need of common sense deregulation. 

Things are different now. Unions are still gone but the working man is back. Because the president is a Blue Collar Billionaire, which is a thing that makes sense. And the Republican party, which is biologically the party of chinless billionaires and six-figure megachurch consultants, is now doing drag. They’re not Drag Queens or Drag Kings (though they’d do that too if asked). They are Drag Peasants: Rich people who are attracted to other rich people dressing up like poor people and putting on a show because it’s fun. And profitable.

So far as political tactics go, Peasant Drag has been terrifyingly effective for the GOP. The campier the better: Not even your drunkest uncle would brag about shooting a dog. But there’s our brave Secretary of Homeland Security mincing in Carhartts and dog-murdermouthing, because when you work at Tractor Supply for $16-an-hour, petslaughter is just something that’s in your DNA I guess.

The policy is primo camp too: Making effeminate things tequila, airplanes and shirts more expensive is a great idea, because it’s going to bring about a golden age of manly working working-man jobs. 

“The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,” says Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick (son of a professor and a sculptor, [who attended college on a tennis scholarship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Lutnick)), explaining why we tariffed islands inhabited only by seabirds. Later adding, “This is the new model…where you work in plants for the rest of your life, and your kids work here and your grandkids work here.” 

Real working class jobs for everyone, forever. This could not be any more ridic if Howard said it while wearing a blue shock-wig and an ombre sequined ball gown. But he’s not taking it back.

By the way, what ever happened to those entrepreneurs and middle class families? Maybe they moved to some distant, barren, heavily tariffed islands. It doesn’t matter: Working class is in, working class is hot, everyone wants some working class. Given how militantly unserious the GOP is, you’d figure it would be at least doable for Democrats to make a pitch: Hey, these Republicans are crazy, maybe here are a few things that could make work suck less. 

But us Democrats can’t get that sentence past our lips. And if we can sometimes, haltingly say it, we can’t quite sing it. 

Part of that’s probably the influence of Bloomberg-types and assorted lobbyists. Some likely comes from the fact that the Chuck Schumer cinematic universe the ‘90s never ended: The Dave Matthews Band is always killing it, *Friends* is always groundbreaking and the most important American voter is a 38-year old lacrosse coach from suburban Denver who loves Applebees, is lukewarm on Newt Gingrich and will shank anyone who comes between him and his private health insurance.

Put a pin in all that. Put several. Because the fault is not (entirely) in our Schumers, but in ourselves.

We’re a little afraid of working class people. 

Not all of us. But a lot of us college-educated, email job, Trader Joe’s shoppers - who are now by and large Democrats - we’re weird around people who didn’t go to college, who work different jobs than ours, and who have less money than we do. Not because we fear that they’re going to burp loudly and ruin our croquet tournaments, but because we’re secretly afraid they hate us. 

We did not personally rig the economic system. But for the last twenty years that fakakta system  has let us enjoy a whole lot of sweet Joe-O’s and Scandinavian Sour Swimmers AND Trader Jose’s Beef Birria Everything-But-The-Bagel Ramen Gyoza, so some resentment is plausible. Plus, we low-key hate ourselves because we can’t fix our own dryers. Suddenly it’s not hot in there and we are beetles on our backs. So it would make a certain kind of emotional sense that that guy who comes to our house to fix it hates us, our weakness and our decadence, as well  

And so a wall goes up, not between us but within us. 

Us types have stewed behind that wall for quite a bit. So long that we’ve come to think that being working class means reciting bible verses before ordering appetizers at The Cracker Barrel, that it's about being able to identify and discuss carburetors. We don’t know anything about any of that. We find it weird. And what is life even if you can’t instantly identify the nebbish lilt of Ira Glass’ voice? Terrifying is what it is. 

But that’s all bullshit: A tsunami of inter-cranial bullshit that's been sloshing back and forth between our ears for so long that it’s eroded strange grooves into our skulls. 

When I drain it all out of my head, I can see the truth - the large, dangling truth that the Drag Peasants have been trying to keep taped up - which is that actually, *I am working class*. And almost certainly so are you.

We’re working class because, get this: We have to work. 

The only real thing in all of this is that if I suddenly stop sending emails and going to Zoom meetings, and if Gary (the guy who came to fix my dryer, and didn’t seem to hate me at all, actually) stops fixing Whirlpools, then everything we have goes away. 

That’s it. 

If you want to be more precise, you can measure your proximity to working class-ness with a simple question: If your paychecks stopped coming tomorrow, how long could you last? How long would it be before you started getting naked threats from your rental or mortgage company? Before you have to have embarrassing conversations with your kids? Before you start to lose weight?

There are people who would answer “never.” And I wish Mr. Bezos well. But if your answer involves a specific unit of time, be it days, weeks or months - then you are among the class of people who have to work. Maybe your 401k is thicc and you could hold out longer than others. Good on you. But that’s only a matter of degree, not kind. The same anaconda you see wrapped around the guy wearing the headset at the Dunkin’ Donuts drive-though is wrapped around you. We try hard not to see our connection for a variety of reasons. But all the places we go to convince ourselves that we’re-not-them / they’re-not-us are actually no place at all. 

Because we feel the squeeze. Oh oh that squeeze.

Every hour that we’re awake.

I’m not sure what to do with the feeling. Discretely thumping my fist on my chest to show my solidarity as the drive-through guy stretches to hand me my medium iced-coffee black probably isn’t the answer. Nor do I know how to seize the means of production. (I guess I’d just go to Home Depot and start stealing stuff?)

But it feels like I should at least get out of my head.

\
By Stefan J. Bos, Worthy News Europe Bureau Chief\
\
WASHINHTON/BERN/BUDAPEST (Worthy News) - Switzerland was hours away from facing the highest U.S. tariff on imports of any developed country after its president left Washington without a deal, upsetting the Alpine nation’s business elite.\
\
Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter rushed to the United States on Tuesday to try to persuade President Donald J. Trump not to impose 39 percent levies.\
\
Yet she failed to clinch a deal, officials said, as the president, who wasn’t invited, did not manage to meet Trump at the White House or anywhere else before her departure from Dulles International Airport at 6:17 p.m.\
\
As the president returned empty-handed to Switzerland, the clock was ticking toward 12:01 a.m. New York time on Thursday, when most Swiss products — from watches to chocolates — would become much more expensive.\
\
With a 39 percent tariff, Switzerland is paying more than twice the rate of European Union member states and several other nations.\
\
Japan, South Korea, and the European Union have rates around 15 percent unless special deals apply, while Canada faces a 35 percent tariff rate.\
\
Earlier in the day, the Swiss leader said she met U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to talk about “bilateral cooperation,” “tariffs,” and “international issues,” without elaborating.\
\
‘FRIENDLY EXCHANGE’\
\
“We had a very good meeting, a very friendly and open exchange about common topics and interests,” Keller-Sutter told Swiss public broadcaster SRF.\
\
Yet her words did little to make CEOs smile again, as they fear the tariffs imposed on Switzerland will cost tens of thousands of jobs. The U.S. is its main market.\
\
Keller-Sutter has been accused of mishandling a vital phone call last week with the White House after Donald Trump announced the shock tariff.\
\
Local media reported that after three months of talks, negotiators believed they had secured a 10 percent tariff on exports to the U.S. — a key market for Swiss products such as luxury watches, jewelry, and chocolate, as well as machinery and pharmaceuticals.\
\
But after a 30-minute call with Keller-Sutter last week — variously described as “bad-tempered,” “disastrous,” and “badly misjudged” — Trump imposed a levy even higher than the 31 percent he had announced on his so-called “liberation day” in April.\
\
The risks to the Swiss economy are sizable. According to experts, a 39 percent tariff rate might reduce 1 percent of Switzerland’s gross domestic product over the medium term.\
\
The Swiss stock market already plunged this week, prompting the cabinet to hold crisis talks and the country’s president to prepare a last-minute flight to Trump-land.\
\
DIFFICULT TIMES\
\
While large multinational companies have some chance of reorienting supply chains and production to cope, it’s much harder for smaller family-owned businesses.\
\
Ypsomed Holding AG plans to move medical device production to the German city of Schwerin, where the tariff is less than half that in Switzerland.\
\
The Burgdorf-based company isn’t alone. Across the country, executives and business owners — from large multinationals such as food giant Nestlé SA to small domestic champions — are trying to figure out how to deal with the new reality.\
\
One high-profile consumer product affected by the Swiss tariffs is Nespresso. Though Nestlé SA sells the coffee capsules worldwide, it only produces them in Switzerland.\
\
“The scale of the levy exceeded all expectations and caught the Swiss business elite off guard,” Bloomberg News commented.\
\
The White House said Friday that it had made the move because Switzerland had refused to make “meaningful concessions” by dropping trade barriers.\
\
“Switzerland, being one of the wealthiest, highest-income countries on earth, cannot expect the United States to tolerate a one-sided trade relationship,” a White House official said.\
\
MASSIVE DEFICIT\
\
Trump has been focused on the U.S. trade deficit with Switzerland, which was 38.5 billion Swiss francs ($48 billion) last year, according to official data.\
\
However, Keller-Sutter said Friday that Bern would keep talking to Washington, but it could offer only limited concessions.\
\
She noted that U.S. imports already enjoyed 99.3 percent free market access and that multiple Swiss companies “had invested heavily in the U.S.”\
\
Switzerland has offered to buy more U.S. liquefied natural gas — as the EU has done — and to encourage Swiss companies to invest more. But Trump wasn’t impressed.\
\
There is still some hope, as market watchers noted that Switzerland’s main export to the U.S. — pharmaceutical products worth $35 billion last year — has not yet been affected by the higher rate.\
\
However, they warned that the unpredictable Trump may change his mind as part of his self-declared effort to move production to the United States and reduce medical costs. \

""After He Chose Her, I Erased Our Seven Years ""","""Josh, once I wake up, I'll completely forget Emilio Vasquez. As for that Wagner family's monster... well, I'm willing to marry him."" Kairi Walker said as she began mixing essential oils.

She was a hypnotist, crafting a unique coffee-scented fragrance that helped people forget painful memories. Her clients ranged from heartbroken women to extreme sports enthusiasts haunted by their experiences, and pet owners mourning their lost companions. Yet, she never imagined she'd one day use hypnosis on herself. Her aim was to erase all memories of the man she had loved for seven years.

""Kairi, what exactly happened with Emilio Vasquez? After the hypnosis, you’ll completely erase him from your mind,"" Josh Walker asked, puzzled by his sister's decision.

Just two weeks earlier, Kairi had excitedly told him that Emilio had finally agreed to marry her. Josh had watched her enthusiastically plan the wedding, from choosing venues to fitting dresses and rings, genuinely happy for her.

Emilio was a chess prodigy sponsored by the Walker family for seven years. He was introverted, almost monk-like, living in a world solely defined by the black and white chess pieces. He had rejected Kairi's affections 99 times. As her brother, Josh had felt her pain as she always tried to break his icy demeanor, but it seemed she'd finally succeeded.

However, a few days later, Emilio was involved in a car accident on the way to a competition and claimed to have lost all memory of Kairi. The wedding was postponed.

""Emilio didn't lose his memory. He's pretending not to know me,"" Kairi said quietly, maintaining her composure.

She had overheard a conversation outside the hospital room, catching Emilio’s female apprentice planning a risky surgery. Afraid she wouldn't survive, she wanted a dream wedding beforehand.

""Emilio, your plan is brilliant. Pretending to marry Kairi made Liv Murphy break down and beg you to be her groom... Ugh, it's so corny.""

""She'll only have me.""

""Aren't you afraid Kairi will make a scene at the wedding?""

""Forget about her. She and I are strangers now. Speaking of which, isn’t she supposed to bring some of that homemade spiced honey cake again? Just toss it out for me.""

Kairi stood frozen, staring at the container in her hand, a wave of bitter sadness washing over her. Emilio wasn't naturally cold; he just wasn’t warm to her. Since he wanted to keep things distant, she'd let him have it his way! A man who had his heart set on another woman, she couldn’t care less about such nonsense.

""Emilio Vasquez is a piece of work!"" Josh's veins bulged with anger, containing his fury. ""Forgetting him is definitely the best choice.""

""Right."" Kairi had already deleted everything relating to Emilio from her phone. She held the coffee-scented fragrance and a pocket watch, opened the door to the hypnosis room, and stepped inside.

""Kairi!"" Josh called out to her. ""That heir to the Wagner family was severely burned in a fire a few years ago, with 90% of his body covered in scars. Although they helped us before, your happiness shouldn't be the price you pay. If you don’t want to...""",1,1754577650.0,novelsfree,2,1.0,False

The writers probably figured giving Carrie a new romance would peak everyone's interest and a baby storyline tends to create interest, as well. It's still lazy. I'd love to find a person that was shocked at the Aiden breakup and the most entertaining thing about the surprise pregnancy was Steve's reaction. Even under the assumption of a new season, the writers couldn't be bothered to make fans wait on pins and needles for the next year with excitement for a new season. 

After the cancelation, one of the first things the media did was place blame on Kim Cattrall. Maybe they don't feel like they have to play nice anymore since there's no show for them to beg her to come back to anymore. I started thinking about what changes they might make to the finale had everyone involved known it would be the last. They would've had to trim some storyline fat instead of giving us things like an old plant, tap-dancing kids, and a creepy puppeteer roommate that we never knew existed until now. Too many new characters and unnecessary mini storylines instead of offering some closure to the existing ones. No room for excitement. If I were one of the writers and wanted to shake things up in order to save the show, I'd go for shock value. What if, after Carrie's rendezvous with Duncan, she goes towards her front steps, looks up and all we see is Carrie's shocked expression. After a couple seconds, she says ""Samantha??"" The end. 

Not entirely sure if Samantha would have Carrie's new address, but that would be something to address in a season premiere. Even though Kim was adamant about not returning to the show, they've still included her by showing that Carrie and Samantha are in communication with each other. The opening scene of the next season premiere could be Carrie meeting up with the girls for coffee to say ""Guess who stopped by my house last night??"" Or in her garden area with her voice-over telling us how it went, and then choosing to keep it to herself as to not upset Charlotte and Miranda for not getting a surprise visit. Sure, there's a risk of fans groaning and moaning from the disappointment that Samantha is not returning. But as a TV show, they'd be creating a lot of buzz and make fans want to see what happens there. I considered maybe it wouldn't be fair to Kim to use her absence as bait, but like I said before, they still include Samantha sprinkles on this shit sundae, so to tease us with her presence isn't that outrageous. Such a shame that a show with great potential was ruined. I hope they're not counting on a petition from fans to bring it back. ",5,1754577400.0,Andjustlikethat,10,1.0,False

I can't tolerate coffee, not even decaf. In the morning I drink Teecino. I like the French Roast most of all, but the Original is also pretty good. A lot of their flavors are good (the dark chocolate is a nice treat), but what I mean is those taste the most like regular coffee to me. It does seem pricey, but you'll come to realize that you only need about half as much as you used to use of coffee. If you're not familiar with Teecino, it's caffeine and acid free and contains probiotics.

Other times I will have Roast Dandelion tea which, if you're over the age of 30, you would recognize tastes an awful lot like Sanka (instant coffee). On average it's about $5.49 for a box of 16, so about 35 cents a cup, under the Traditional Medicine brand. I've been unable to find a bulk source of this so far.

But mostly I missed something in my water. I went down the rabbit hole, and it is really hard to find drink enhancers that don't have citric acid. Citric acid is an automatic flare-up for me. What I discovered is some enhancers do use malic acid or lactic acid. Both malic acid and lactic acid are higher on the pH scale, so they are less acidic than citric acid. I found a brand called Aguas Frescas that had no citric acid, but I'm waiting for a reply from them because on Amazon their products have lactic acid only but on Walmart the same product has citric acid. So I sent them a message to clarify but have yet to receive a response.

In the meantime, Walmart sells a drink enhancer with electrolytes under the Good Value brand, Watermelon flavor, that has just lactic acid. I got it today and tried it. It doesn't taste like watermelon, more like watermelon *candy*. But whatever, it's better than plain water. They apparently also have a Green Apple flavor without citric acid. I'm going to try that one next. There is also a Grape flavor with malic acid only. These are the short liquid bottles with the light blue wrapper. I'm really hoping these are going to be tolerable.",2,1754577391.0,GERD,0,0.75,False

While it might seem strange, despite my many trips all over the world, I've never had a long layover. So, on the way back from my trip to Greece, I found a return flight with an \~20 hr layover in London. I've really wanted to visit the city, but it just hadn't happened. This time I said, ""Why not?""

I like to call myself a non-risk-taking adventurer, meaning I only take ""risks"" that have been planned and calculated. I am not very spontaneous, and I have had amazing solo travels being this way. But again, I wanted to try visiting a new place in less than a day.

I booked the flight and did some research about the best place to stay. Of course it's London, so it's probably the easiest city to learn how to ""layover."" I was still a bit nervous about getting through immigration and customs late at night and nervous about being too tired and feeling too rushed, especially after a long busy trip in Greece.

True to my nature, I started planning how I'd spend my time. I figured that I'd wake up around 6 am and get an early start so that I could be back at the airport by 2 pm. I knew that I would only be able to do basically a long, self-guided walking tour, and I was okay with that.

To cut it short, the layover and the ""trip"" was FANTASTIC. It was so different and nice that I will now search out long layovers back to London and anywhere really. I found that it was a great opportunity to get me excited to come back to the U.K. for a longer and fuller trip.

**The Logistical BASICS:** I arrived at 9 pm (BST) and was through immigration and customs in less than a minute with the new digital system. Claiming my checked carry-on bag took much longer (about 30 minutes), but even taking the Elizabeth line, I was at Paddington station by 10:30 pm. I managed to sit down at a nice Indi n restaurant and enjoyed a meal. I then checked in for a night of sleep at the Best Western in Paddington (an affordable, bare bones, and comfortable stay).

**The Walking Tour:** Waking up at 6, I packed and left my luggage at the front desk by 7. I walked from Paddington through Hyde Park after grabbing an amazing latte from Blank Street Coffee. The park was absolutely beautiful, and I loved walking through and people watching all of the runners and commuters. Google Maps took me through the Rose Garden, which was in full bloom with all of my favorite flowers and more.

At the end of Hyde Park, I came to Buckingham Palace and enjoyed viewing the exterior and taking a few photos without the crowds. From Buckingham Palace, I walked to Westminster Abbey and took photos of Big Ben from one of the famous red telephone booths. It was only 8:45, and I debated waiting in the line to go into Westminster Abbey, but waiting until 9:30 with such little time wasn't practical. So, I decided to see a few more sites.

I took the tube to a stop near St. Paul's Cathedral and walked to see it. A few more photos later and I was on my way to see the London Bridge and the Tower Bridge as well as the Tower of London (walking). By see, of course, I mean viewing and walking the exteriors. It was still amazing. I walked across the Tower Bridge and around the Tower of London. I stopped in the gift shop for a few souvenirs, and then I took an uber boat (!!!) back to Westminster.

Waiting for the Uber Boat took longer than I expected, but the ride down the River Thames was quick and so much fun! I made the short walk from the pier to the Covent Garden area, and the shops were alive and lively. Live singers were performing in a wine shop to a captive audience, and two jugglers were staging a performance in the open space. I purchased some tea from Whittard, and then headed to Bao Soho to try their buns (Delicious, a good size, and not expensive! I purchased the pork and fried chicken baos as well as the sweet potato fries). I walked over to the luxe shops of Mayfair to stop at my favorite store (Diptyque) to purchase a candle. 

At this point, it was almost 1 pm, so I decided to hop on the Elizabethline to collect my things in Paddington. The train I was on skipped many stops, so it was a quick 10 minute ride. I was back in Paddington by 1. The receptionist at the Best Western was so kind and nice that I decided to sit and enjoy by baos.

A little shopping at the Paddington Bear store (Please don't judge me! I never buy this many souvenirs when I travel, but now I am an aunt and wanted to get something for my nephew.), and I was off to the airport. This time I took the Heathrow Express. It is expensive and not really worth it, but after taking the Uber Boat, the tube, walking, etc. I wanted to ""complete"" my London transit experience.

I arrived at the airport with 2 hours to spare, thinking about how I could have happily spent an extra hour in the city. Grateful, nonetheless! And most importantly, I was not tired at all. Getting through security both coming and going was a breeze like I've never experienced, and everywhere I went in London I was treated with such excellence in service! I'm really impressed with the city.

Do you intentionally incorporate long layovers into your solo trips? I'd love to hear some of your stories. I know things can easily go wrong, but it seems like I've been missing out!",16,1754577288.0,solotravel,10,0.94,False
1mk1qu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1mk1qu7/trapped_in_a_picture_frame/,Trapped in a Picture Frame,"July 11, 2025; Liam opens the café doors, a simple glance at the area, and he can’t help but scowl at it already. The area is too cold, the walls are a tacky colour of pastel blue whilst the floorboards are made of hickory, much to Liam’s distaste. Pictures of leaves and vines are hung up on the wall, but the art looks rather mediocre in Liam’s opinion. Security cameras are noticeable, which is rather off-putting for him. In fact, the entire area is less than satisfactory to Liam. It's far from photogenic. Nothing compliments each other well, and nothing looks good on its own either, yet for some reason many people crowd the place. Liam sighs, regretting visiting the area. But he was invited here for a reason.

He looked across the room finally spotting her in a corner. Liam strides her table, taking a seat across her. A windsor chair painted in white, a rather plain and uncomfortable chair paired alongside a plain white table with dark blue table mats laid on top of it with unnecessary patterns embezzled. Liam notices how vines crawl up the table’s leg, a rather tacky design choice from his point of view. The café’s design continues to disappoint him. But Liam must focus, he can critique the café some other time.

Sitting across him is his girlfriend, Jessica. She’s a rather simple looking girl. Medium length brown hair, not too clean, not too messy. Down-turned brown eyes that make her look clueless. A light amount of blush and red lipstick, which were rather unnecessary. She wore a sleeveless dark red top with black jeans, a plain look for a plain girl. “Oh! Good morning, Liam! How are you?” She greets him, sounding slightly nervous. Quite unusual for her, but Liam could hardly care to comment on it.

“Jessica, if you were going to invite me out, choose a nicer place. Only amateurs would come here- look at the people here. All amateurs. Look at the guy behind you- does he even know how to use a hairbrush?” Liam continues to complain, eying down every single customer around them until his attention focuses on Jessica again. “In fact- look at yourself. How could you be wearing that? If you’re going to ask me out, wear something nice at least.”

Jessica smile falters, pausing momentarily before speaking “You didn’t even bother to say hello. You just had to start complaining again,” She holds her head down, not being able to meet his gaze. Liam finds it cowardly. “I was at least hoping to have a friendly conversation with you before I…” Jessica becomes silent once more

Raising an eyebrow, Liam questions her, “Before what? If you’re going to be upset, be honest.” He picks up the fork, tapping it on the table rhythmically.

Jessica sighs, forcing herself to look at him. “We need to break up.” She admits in an assured tone. She waits for a response; she waits for a rebuttal or another question. But Liam simply does not react. He has the same stern expression he had when he entered the café, the same stern expression he had when she asked him out, the same stern expression he had when they first met 6 years ago. 6 years, and he hasn’t changed at all. “Are you- are you not going to say anything?” she grips the table, silently hoping for some sort of reaction from him.

“What is there to say?”

“I don’t know!” Jessica stutters, “Aren’t you going try to change my mind? Or at least ask for an explanation?” he has no reply, aggravating her. “For the duration of our entire relationship- I had been putting up with your condescending nature for the sake of *our* relationship- because I thought we *loved* each other!” she looks down, holding her head. “But no. After all this time you don’t even dignify me with a reaction! Do I really mean *that* little to you?” her voice strains, her tone becoming harsher. “I thought I could fix you, that over time you’d learn to like things for once and stop complaining about how things are anything *but* picture perfect! I wish that you’d learn how to be *happy* for once!” she looks back up, suddenly pausing.

Liam is gone.

Liam exits the café, escaping into the sunlight, finding no reason to stay any longer. He saw no reason to sit around and listen to his now ex complain about him, she made her point clear, so there’s no point sticking around. Truth be told, Liam is far from surprised. He never saw them sharing a future together; Jessica was too clueless, too much of a mess, too charitable. Marriage often seems necessarily if someone wants to have a picture-perfect life. But Jessica was far from a perfect woman, let alone a perfect partner. Liam had simply just settled for her.

On his drive, his gaze can’t help but flicker and find faults in everything; cracked pavement, graffiti, misplaced sewers, too many and yet not enough trees and shrubs set up across sidewalks. too many people walking across them wearing such horrid clothing and talking too loud. Puddles laying down on concrete after it rained last night. *Everything* had faults. *Everyone* had had faults. But there was once place devoid of it, one place that was perfect.

After a 24 minute drive, Liam finds himself at his house. Perfectly clean white walls. Perfectly spotless oak floorboards. Perfectly placed paintings with forests and gardens drawn onto them. Almost as perfect as his own garden. The rooms were comfortably cold, accompanied by peace and quiet. Counters, tables, and shelves were polished perfectly, all in shades of white and black. No lamp was too bright or too dim. Everything was clean, everything was modern, everything was perfect. He shuts the door, ignoring the click of a camera.

He hangs his dinner jacket on a nearby coat hanger, dawning a pure shade of white. Liam scowls, such a nice coat was wasted for a day like this. He removes his shoes and places them beside a glass table with a pot of white roses on top. He glances to the pot’s left and it seems that a camera has sat beside it, yet as he blinks, it disappears. He steps up pearly white stairs with pure black handrails, assuming it was simply a trick of the mind. Sunlight slips through the clear windows, following behind Liam as he moves towards his room.

He opens the bedroom door, the creaking drowning out the clicking sound behind him. Liam sweeps his dirty blonde hair aside, feeling something wet beneath him as he takes his first step. A puddle! Liam scoffs, unsure of how it’s here, but ultimately decides he’ll clean it up later, otherwise, his room was perfect. His white king-sized bed was neatly made, with dark blue pillows laid straight against the dark oak headboard. Above the bed lied a painting of a beautiful meadow. The matching dark oak bedtables had potted plants on top of them, all holding white roses. At the foot of the bed is a clean white mat. On the opposite side of the room, a circular coffee table and a bergère chair is at the corner. The door to the bathroom is to its left, and to it’s right leads to the balcony. Everything is perfect. Clean, modern, and perfect.

But there’s something new now.

After using his washroom, he left the room and had noticed something hanging over his chair, Liam moves closer. Hanging on the wall is a framed picture of a camera placed outside what seems to be a museum. An odd photo, and certainly one Liam would never own, a photograph that was never here in the first place. There’s no meaning and no beauty behind it. It is completely out of place.

Someone must have broken into his house.

He steps out onto the balcony, looking across the ground, trying to spot anything that could allude to a break in. He believes he could spot a random lamp in the midst of the garden, but it leaves the very second, he glances back at it. Unable to see anything more at this distance, he rushes out of his room, rushes through the halls, trying to reach the backdoor. He puts his shoes back on, ignoring how his table magically became dark oak.

He opens the glass door that leads to his backyard; white roses bloom in the sunlight, dancing along the wind gently. He leans down, scouting the ground, yet he doesn’t find any footprints, or anything else miscellaneous. There’s absolutely nothing to suggest someone has intruded, nothing but that photograph. He scowls, clutching his fist at the lack of evidence. He abandons the garden, opening the door, stepping across the mahogany floorboards.

Mahogany?

He freezes, rubbing his eyes, blinking frantically. He knows he’s not crazy, and he knows the floors weren’t meant to be like this. So how did they change? He looks up, then down. Still mahogany. He looks forward at his front door, then down again. Still Mahogany. He looks back, then forward, then down at the mahogany floorboards, but then he looks forward again. Are those red roses in his flowerpot?

He stumbles across the corridor, trying to fix his composure. Red! A bold and distracting colour. It’s so out of place! How were they changed so suddenly? Right in front of him?

Liam takes a deep breath, unable to comprehend all the sudden changes, all these new imperfections. He removes his shoes, a pointless act, but he wouldn’t want to ruin his home any further. He walks upstairs, phone in one hand whilst the other holds onto the white handrails. “Come on… Liam… Think!” He stumbles into his room, considering who he should call. The police? How can even explain the situation *without* sounding like a joke? He opens the bedroom door and places his phone on the bed, glancing around the room for any other changes.

The photograph; as he approaches closer, he’s immediately taken aback, almost knocking down the windsor chair. It changed again.

The picture now depicts a liminal space, a photo gallery specifically. The photo is position directly at the edge of the wall that has various photos of a house. *His* House. He continues to stare at the picture, trying to piece any details together, but then his eyes darted towards the edge of the wall.

A hand can be seen from the very edge, wearing what seems to be a trench coat’s sleeves and skin tight black gloves with wires pulsing in and out of them. On second thought, those gloves could very much be its skin instead. Blood spills out from where the wires sink inside the skin, staining the sleeve. Liam fixates his attention on it, questioning if it was there originally or not. He continues to question it until…

It moves.

The arm grips the wall tightly, as something metallic peaks out from the corner. But before it could reveal itself, Liam impulsively punches the photograph, unsettled by the revelation.

A Hole is torn in the picture, paper softly ripping off. Yet despite the damage, he can still see it move. He can see its head- no- a camera taking the place of a head peak from the side. Her lens staring straight at him, piercing his soul.

In a fit of impulsivity, he rips the photo apart, shredding the paper piece by piece until the figure can no longer be recognised. He holds the shredded pieces in his hand, breathing heavily. He picks up any fallen bits and throws it all away into a bin, setting his aims towards getting rid of what else remains of the photo. Liam hooks the picture frame of the wall, searching for an area to chuck it away for good *without* making a mess.

He buries it.

Entering his garden once again, he grabs a shovel and starts to dig, dig, and dig. Red roses watch over the whole, seeing the picture frame fall into obscurity. Liam covers the whole with dirt, breathing heavily. Hoping it stays down there for good. He smooths over the land with his shovel, trying not to disrupt the garden’s scenery.

Walking back into his home, he stands at the entrance, completely dazed by the house’s pastel blue walls. “It’s- It’s *still* changing?” Liam speaks, his voice barely above a whisper. He looks from side to side, trying to note anymore changes. His windows are noticeably stained; a Black ooze dripping from the edges. At the foot of the front door a rainbow mat meets it end. Not knowing what else to do, Liam pulls out his phone and takes a picture, documenting the changes.

He hears the back door close behind him, he turns back impulsively, only to be greeted by the oak door instead. He opens it once more, no one is there. No one, but a gaping hole in his garden. No footprints stem from it, there’s no proof of human life. Just an aching hole in the dirt.

Breathing heavily and mouth agape, Liam’s eyes widen. He grabs the nearby shovel laying at the doorstep and shakes the dirt off it. Pointing at the hole, he slowly steps away from the back door, locking it shut as soon as he’s out of the garden. He turns around, pushing his back towards the door, gripping the shovel tightly. Someone is here. Some*thing* is here. And yet he can’t even find it.

Liam digs into his pockets, searching for his phone. “Shit- “he mutters under his breath; he left it in his room. He tries to run back into the staircase before falling face first into the floor, slipping over something liquid-like. Dazed, Liam pulls himself up again, brushing his hair aside, ensuring it’s still well kept. He looks down, spotting what made him trip. Beneath him lies a puddle of puddle something similar enough to water, yet something about its stillness keeps it distinct from water. Perhaps it’s the sudden itchiness, the sudden burn, he feels after touching it is what differentiates the liquid from simply being plain water.

He needs to call for help.

Rushing up the staircase, Liam leaves a trail of bloody footprints in his path. As soon as he opens his bedroom door, he stains the vibrant orange mat with the crimson fluid, finding that the painting of the meadow that once loomed over his bed has been replaced with a photo of a gallery. The same gallery that had pictures of his house. The same gallery that had that thing that moved.

And she’s still there.

Facing the other end of the hall, the camera-headed figure faces away from Liam. Her tan trench coat is tattered and ripped at the edges, dust sinking into the seams of the fabric. Blood is splattered around her sleeves, crimson liquid dripping from its camera. She touches another frame, this one detailing another house. He steps carefully, glancing away from the photo for a split second to take away his phone. He turns his away and looks behind. More photographs litter the wall, photos of random rooms unfamiliar to him. He quickly exits his room and starts to turn on his phone, yet it refuses to open. It stays blank. Dead. Liam curses underneath is breath.

Exiting his room, Liam is astonished by the sudden change in sight. He’s not even at his own house anymore. Marble red floors with random photographs littered across them. Black walls with white picture frames hanging on them, detailing more different rooms and houses. There are wilted red roses in cracked flowerpots. A white staircase leading downstairs Liam stands still for a moment, trying to recollect his thoughts. “Where am I-…” He cuts himself off, hearing a sudden noise.

Flowing water. Droplets dripping and falling underneath the floor. Liam picks himself up, stumbling as he rushes downstairs, becoming less coordinated with each step he takes downstairs until he eventually falls. Smashing against the floor. Feeling a layer of water beneath him raising higher, Liam attempts to pull himself up but struggles to do so. He gets on his knees, shaking with each movement, his fingers brush a deep red bruise sinking into his cheek. It stings, not just his bruise, but his entire face, wet from the unnamed fluid. He instinctively touches his face, silently begging for the irritation to stop. But his skin can’t help but burn. Flaring his skin.

Liam impulsively rubs his face as the liquid, developer, continues to flood. Staining his cloths, sinking into the acacia floorboards and nearing to his face. Yet Liam is too overwhelmed by the burning sensation.

In a matter of minutes, Liam is completely submerged by the developer liquid, leaving him alone to drown. Still attacked by the flaming deep inside his skin, he closes his eyes. He sinks into the fluid, choking out and loosing his breath.

For a moment, everything is dark.

It’s dark, wet, and warm. Yet Liam is still awake, the chemical irritation still crawling and piercing his skin. Forcing his eyes to open wide.

This isn’t his house.

Eclipsed by the dark ocean of developer liquid that engulfs him, pulling him deeper inside the abyss. Everything is completely obscured until a red light emerges from the surface. Hovering over Liam, teasing him with hope. Liam extends his hand towards the light and tries to swim towards it, yet ultimately, he falls weak.

He closes his eyes.

Clenches his teeth as the stings plaguing his skin gets worse.

Lowering his hand away from the red light.

And drifts away.

Sinking deeper into the developer.

As his mind goes blank.

Ignoring what lays above him.

Seconds, minutes, maybe even hours pass. Liam blinks frequently, finally opening his eyes and stares up at his ceiling. It’s pure white, just like how it’s meant to be. He sits up, brushing his wet hair aside. The floor is oak, the walls are white, and windows are spotless. Everything seems to be normal, yet he can still feel the chemical irritation burning his flesh, his skin wet. Liam glances to his right, staring out his balcony. His eyes widen.

The lush and verdant forest once standing behind his home has vanished, not a single trace of his once perfect garden remains. Instead, it’s the gallery he saw in the photos. The gallery that took over his home.

Liam stumbles out of bed, determined to get out of this place. He heads towards his door, trying to force it open. Yet it’s locked. He throws his body at the door and slams himself against it, “Shit- why won’t it BUDGE?” his voice strains as he fumbles with the lock. Yet no matter what he tries, it won’t open. It *can’t* open. But he won’t give up.

He bangs on the door relentlessly, kicking it, slamming it. Doing whatever it takes to break it open. In his fit of desperation, he could hardly hear the footsteps from afar.

Tap.

Liam freezes in his tracks.

Tap.

He starts breathing heavily.

Tap.

That *thing* is here.

Tap.

That *thing* put him here.

Click.

Taking a deep breath, Liam looks behind him. Outside of what once was his balcony stands the camera-headed figure. Wires sink in and then rip out of her skin, blood fallings from the torn flesh staining her shirt and coat. On the side of her head, a photo is printed, however she doesn't take it out, instead she just leaves. Travelling down the gallery's halls.

Liam is left alone in his room. What once was his place of sanctuary, a place free from the world’s imperfections, somewhere where he had complete control over. Is now his prison room. His cell. Everything is the same but everything that was once perfect to him just feels far from correct. Nothing here is.

He sinks to the floor, carrying an empty gaze.

Forever trapped in the picture frame.

1mk1qg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/pahungaw/comments/1mk1qg4/tw_sexual_harassment_stalking_trauma/,"TW: sexual harassment, stalking, trauma","Last May, gi sexual harass ko sa akong classmate sa minor subject. Nag send siya ug mga things thru chat nga super uncomfortable like “your scent makes me horny”, “tara 3 hours pa bugnaw”, and magtawag-tawag siya randomly after saying “open minded ka? I-rate ni sa VC.” Like grabe ka bastos.

He even stalked me during one of our events. Good thing ato nga day, niuban ko sa akong childhood friends (same program mi) so wala siya kabalo nga dili to akong boarding house iyang gisundan.

Nag file ko ug blotter sa police and nag submit ko ug complaint sa OSA sa school. Summer class, pero wala ko nag-enroll kay I was still really scared. Mid of July, gipatawag ko sa OSA head, giingnan ko nga mo balik ko sa office para hatagan ko niya ug update.

Pag-adto nako, ingon siya nga gi acknowledge daw sa guy iyang gibuhat and ni-promise siya nga di na gyud ko niya hilabtan. Pero ni-reveal pud ang OSA head nga nag take daw siya ug pictures nako sa school, night market, mall, and sa coffee shop near school.

Gi-ingnan pud siya nga mobalik sa OSA office to submit a letter (di ko sure if explanation or apology), pero wala siya ni tunga. So they decided to coordinate with the RAC para ma-block iyang account sa portal so wala siya’y choice kundi mo-adto gyud sa OSA.

Last week, nag plano na ko nga mo-enroll this week, pero naay nahitabo na pud. Akong former classmate, nga same class with my perpetrator sa summer, nag send ug video nako nga nag sulti siya ug “naay nahitabo sa amoa” and “hinhin ra kaayo bayhana pero wild.”

That really broke me down, kay kabalo ko sa akong self nga wala gyud mi nagbuhat og anything. We didn’t do it. The only people nga kabalo sa akong side kay akong friends ug family ra.

Karun, it’s been three days na nga sige ko suka after every kaon, di ko mogawas sa akong room, and di ko makigstorya — only a few and selected ones lang akong ginakommunicate.

Wala na ko’y courage mo-adto ug school, kay wala ko kabalo pila na sila iyang giingnan ug unsa ilang huna-huna sa ako. Nagplano ko nga mo-drop out or mag-transfer, pero di pa ko sure. I’m scared nga basin maulit ra ni tanan.

Akong family gusto nga ipadayon ang lawsuit nga gi plan pa since May, pero nagduha-duha ko. Not because I’m scared, pero kay kabalo ko nga grabe ka bagal ang justice system diri sa PH. It might take years before makuha ang justice nga deserve nako.

So I told them na maybe mas maayo pa nga mag move on nalang ko, stay away from possible scenarios nga ma trigger ko balik, and let karma do the rest.",2,1754577256.0,pahungaw,1,1.0,False
1mk1qcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadatravel/comments/1mk1qcy/traveling_to_jasper_and_banff/,Traveling to Jasper and Banff,"Any tips or current info to know about being in Jasper and Banff in August? 

We will miss the meteor shower unfortunately. But the weather looks good and fires seem to be contained and not in the immediate area. 

We’re so excited! 🤩

Edit: I’m adding some details to aid in tip giving as there are many types of travel that warrant different ideas/tips. 

I’ve done a decent amount of research and been planning this for like 9 months. All of our stays are booked and we will have a rental car to drive to our destinations. 

We will be in Calgary for a night. 
Then a place between Jasper and Banff a few nights. 
Check out the Columbia icefields. 
And also stay in Jasper a few nights.  

I’ve looked into the Banff and Jasper gondolas, several of the lakes for cruise and for canoe or kayaking, the icefields, a few hikes, and a couple sights in Calgary worth a look. And MAYBE the downhill sledding in Banff. It looks fun and I’ve wanted to do ones I’ve seen before. But have also seen horrific videos of people being really dumb and hurting others on things like that. 

But any tips on specific trails or sights less popular but worth a visit, please share. Example, Utah Canyonlands vs Arches National Park. Arches needs reservations, has long waits/lines, small parking lot and small park in general. Right down the road is Canyonlands NP. Huge with tons to see, no reservations or lines really bc it’s so big. 

I have not done much food research as it can be hard to tell online what you’ll get in person sometimes. But suggestions of good places for breakfast, coffee, or dinner…etc. 

Are the gondola top restaurants good or not worth a likely overpriced meal? Sometimes those things are worth it and sometimes not. 

Should we carry cash or will cc pmt options be pretty widespread?

1mk1qau,https://www.reddit.com/r/BFS/comments/1mk1qau/my_story_so_far/,My story….  So far…,"Hello, I am 34M with a wife and 2.5 year old.  For about 3 years I was taking methylphenidate and loved my coffee!!  I had no problems doing Ritalin and having a strong cold brew.  Having a child in day care, there were sicknesses going around the house constantly.  End of January into beginning of February of this year- I was sick with some sort of flu.  Recovered after a few days and went back to my daily routine of 18mg of Ritalin, strong coffee, and zyn pouch on my way to work.   I strength train 2-3 times a week as well and would use the stair climber 2-3 times a week.  I would drink bourbon on the weekends sometimes 5-7 ounces a night Friday through Sunday. 

Beginning of March I noticed my right calf constantly twitching.  Did not think anything of it and figured it would go away with a few days time.  March 9th I went for a very long walk with the family.  After that long walk my calf was twitching violently all night and hardly slept.   March 10th was the same deal and by March 11th I was in full panic mode.  I felt something was seriously wrong.  Had blood work done March 12th and everything came back normal.  

Ritalin, nicotine, and caffeine was discontinued after onset of symptoms. 



EMG in mid April came back clean but was not surprised since it was a month into the onset of symptoms.  In mid April it was almost laughable at the cause of the twitching, considering all the stimulants I was taking months prior.  Saw a neurologist who put me on Gabapentin in mid April.  Gabapentin did not control the twitching but did help me sleep at night.  I felt I was finally regaining control of my life since I was sleeping better.

Shortly after Memorial Day my index finger would spasm/twitch inward towards my middle finger.  Full panic mode for a week or two on the onset of this.  Early June I would feel trembling in my face.  Left triceps would twitch in the mornings for a couple weeks and then stop for a week or two.  Met with the neurologist once again in late June.  He states he thought the face trembling is anxiety.  He performed another EMG and said everything came back clean with no MND.  He stated “you definitely do not have ALS.”  He knew this was a major concern of mine.  He stated he thinks there might be nerve compression based on the EMG.  So he also ordered upper, mid, and lower spine mri which came back clean. 

I was put on 5mg of Baclofen at night and to increase to 10mg after a week.  This was in late June.  July 2nd I did strength training like I have done many times before.  I had total body weakness after lifting that went into the next day.  My weakness was so bad on July 3rd I had trouble lifting my arms and shoulders.  Saw my PCP on July 3rd who thought anxiety and prescribed Xanax and Prozac.  Friday July 4th was about 95 degrees and saw friends outdoors and I was exhausted.  I was having trouble breathing and couldn’t stand for long.  Weakness and shakiness seemed to subsided slightly following weeks after taking 10 mg of Prozac daily and discontinuing the Baclofen.  I still notice it here and there. 

July 7th I noticed a “pre twitch” in my left lower eyelid.  Felt like it would twitch at any second but did not start until 7/21.  Constant little zapping in left lower eyelid and if I blink hard goes into full twitching.  My calf still twitches 24/7 but I walk for 1 hour daily.  Still strength train 2-3 days a week.  Index finger on left hand still twitches after certain strain or movements.  Of course, I get full body twitching randomly for a few seconds at a time.   I have had a few panic attacks during the month of July when I would feel intense weakness.  The Xanax seemed to help me snap out of it.  

Yes the twitches can drive me absolutely insane.  At this point, neurologist believes it is BFS but I have another appointment in September.   Basically symptoms are to be monitored for some time.  I would be lying if I said I was not scared.  Of course I am scared but I do have really really good days where I am thankful for my family and mobility.  In some levels, this has changed me for the better.  Again, I stopped caffeine (for the most part), total cessation of Ritalin and Zyn pouches. I went months without having a drink.  But maybe once a week or two I will have one or two pours of bourbon.  I appreciate this sub so much and please keep moving forward.  ",2,1754577246.0,BFS,1,1.0,False
1mk1pof,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mk1pof/should_i_ask_out_my_best_friends_sister/,Should I ask out my best friends sister,"Hello, I've literally never posted on reddit before so bear with me 

  
I've (M) have a best friend (F), we've known each other for maybe 10 years at this point. I met her sister at her birthday party and we talked for a while and found out we live in the same city, and she works at a coffee place near me. She told me to come but I never did, because I didn't think anything of it. this was 6 months ago.

Fast forward to best friends wedding two weeks ago, her sister is there again, we have a few conversations with some pretty intense eye contact, there isn't any slow dances at this wedding so I didn't have that opportunity, but we talked multiple times. She remembered that I never came to see here at work and told me to come again, which I thought was a good sign. At the end of the night I gave her a hug, and she touched my arm as I walked away, which kinda made me feel some type of way. 

And now, I went to where she works but she was in the process of moving so she had a few days off, and wasn't working when I went in. I follow her on instagram, and I sent her a DM of a picture holding it, and I said something along the lines of, ""I went but you weren't there, I got scammed."" We sent a couple messages back and forth talking about it. The last message I sent, I said ""I'll have to come back sometime when you're actually there."" She responded almost a full day later, saying ""yeah I'll be there in the mornings the next couple weeks."" 

Basically, do I go back when she's there and ask her out, or is she just being nice to me? The entire day response time makes me a little worried about it. Normally I wouldn't care, but it might be awkward with my friend if I read it wrong, and her sister makes a big deal out of it.
