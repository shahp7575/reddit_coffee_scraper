Hey everyone,

I just moved here about 3 weeks ago and I’m still getting settled. I’m 30, Black, and currently staying near Makati/BGC. Don’t really know anyone out here yet, so I’m looking to meet people around my age to hang out with.

I’m into basketball, fitness, gaming (big 2K player), exploring new spots, and just having good conversations. Open to grabbing coffee, checking out food spots, hitting the gym, or playing ball.

If you’re also new here or just looking to expand   your circle, feel free to comment or DM.

If I didn't have 2 hours, I wouldn't start. But life is messy, and those 2-hour windows rarely exist.

So, I started obsessing over my ""pockets of time""—the 10-minute gaps between meetings, the wait for the bus, or the time the coffee is brewing. Instead of mindless scrolling, I treated these 10 minutes like gold.

In those 10 minutes, I:

* **Went for a quick, light jog.**
* **Simply sat in silence to breathe and clear my head.**
* **Did a quick stretch to wake up my body.**
* **Organized my messy desk for a fresh start.**
* **Watered my plants and watched them for a moment.**

It felt small, almost insignificant at first. But after a month, those 10-minute blocks added up to hours of growth. I realized that respecting my small moments was actually respecting myself.

Don't wait for the ""perfect time."" It doesn't exist. Value the tiny gaps you have right now. That’s where the magic actually happens.",1,1771549772.0,koreangig,0,1.0,False

1r9helh,https://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/1r9helh/nonmaga_christian_group_update_from_nonmaga_church/,Non-MAGA Christian Group? (Update from Non-MAGA Church),"Hi all - back again from my post 5 months ago titled ""Non-Maga Church?"" Where I reached out with an open heart to the community trying to find a new church home for my family after my pastor went wack. To my surprise, over 1.8k good people interacted with my post and I received nearly 40 church recommendations. To everyone out there who helped, THANK YOU! I wanted to update you all that my family took one of your recommendations a week later and we did find a great church home and have been attending for the past 5 months :') This would not have been possible without everyone who came forward to support during such a difficult time for my family. 

But now I am back with a new thing, and I need to know if I'm the only one out there who needs this: Start a Non-Maga Christian Social Group? (think fun arts/crochet groups, run/hiking groups, movie outings, tennis/sports, cooking groups) Does anyone just miss finding good people to hang out with and do these things with? I'm not talking about bible study small groups (all though I need one of those too), I just mean PEOPLE to do life with!

After reading countless stories from you all on my original post of how many of you (just like me) left your churches in mass exodus after witnessing corruption, failure, and pure disappointment over these last grueling 10+ years of trump rising to power - I've realized we must all be feeling the same way: ""I miss being around other good Christians ... but where are they?"" If you're anything like me, you've already tried looked up Christian social groups thinking at one point or another ""hmm maybe I'll join this cute christian crochet club"" and then immediately been terrified thinking, ""...But what if they're all MAGA?"" Or worse, it's just already clear on their group post that they are sponsored by a super MAGA church (*\*\*cough\*\* cough\*\*\* Mariners \*\*cough\*\* cough\*\* Calvalry ew*). 

I want people to play sports with, people to crochet with, people to see movies with, people to get coffee with, people who remember who God **really** is and don't believe that ICE killing people is fine if the person was ""messing with their job."" (Like ew, what?) I don't think it's possible for our hope, our resilience, our faith, or even our joy to survive if we don't have anywhere to go to just be social and fun and to just feel **safe** again. Faith starts with fun, and I need that. 

I want to start a social group. I just want to reconnect people like me (who really love God and love humanity) with other humans who still want the same thing. If you have a brain, and you just want to find other real, normal, not insane Christians to make some fun social groups with (run club, crafting, reading, movies, cooking, hiking etc) - let me know if you have even a remote interest in something like that and I'll start one in the OC. 

If you're in the OC and down for that vibe, let me know by filling out this interest form. There's no definitive timeline right now, this is just to do a test run and see if there is even anyone interested in something like that for our community. 

Let me know! Sending love to you all out there who are still surviving, my prayers are with you: [Social Group Interest Form](https://young-honeycrisp-d41.notion.site/2f7b1d11893380b6866ee6c05a3c3d02)

I've always been a quiet person and find it virtually impossible to meet new people. I moved to a different state for work \~11 years ago, and even after all those years, I still don't have any friends here. Aside from my therapist, I don't even think I could name a single person outside of work. All I ever do is go to work, and then try and find something to pass the time and not think about how lonely I am.

I've tried going out to meet people, but it always results in me just sitting there awkwardly the whole time. I've tried online dating, and I rarely get any matches, so I can't even blame that on my lack of social skills.

I've probably been on 20-30 coffee dates since moving here (the vast majority of these were pre-lockdown. Since lockdown ended, I've probably only been on 4 or 5 coffee dates? Not sure if that's just a coincidence), and every single one of them either ended with them ghosting me, or telling me we didn't click. 

It's getting to a point where I get depressed every time I go out. It's hard seeing everyone else interacting with their friends/partner, and it just reminds me that I'll never have anything like that.

The only good thing I have in my life is cat.

Last year I went through a pretty emotionally difficult ordeal, and for quite a while I was convinced I was finally going to kill myself. Thinking about what would happen to my cat if I were gone was the only thing that kept me from going through with it. 

This, along with some changes at work, have made it virtually impossible for me to focus on my work for the last few months. 

Some days I go into the office, spend the whole day scrolling on my phone, and then leave. I take Adderall for ADHD, but that hasn't really been helping as much anymore. I'm not sure how no one at work has noticed. Every day I feel like I'm just falling further and further behind, and it's only a matter of time until it all blows up in my face.

I have a decent amount of money saved up, so I'm thinking I should just quit my job and try and coast on my savings until my cat passes from old age.

The stress at work just keeps getting worse, but I'm also scared of quitting.

Eventually after being chased away from the surplus I settled down in a small farmhouse. I was happy. Food was less of an issue, thanks to several crates full of potatoes I had found along with a prepper house stuffed with canned goods. I was safe. But still something drew me out. Maybe it was the promise of nails to keep construction going easily. Maybe it was boredom. Regardless of why, I ventured out, it was all going so well... A few zombies here and there, nothing I hadn't or couldn't handle... After a scuffle however I noticed it, a deep gash in the palm of my hand. Somewhere along the way, I had been tagged. I cleaned the wound, wrapped it in bandages, hoped and prayed... but the symptoms soon appeared, and I knew it was the end.

After a short time at home, watching a VHS and enjoying a large fruit salad, I ventured out again. This time knowing I wouldn't return. I brought with me only my weapons. An m14, an M1911, and a shotgun, as well as every magazine and shell I had.

I left a note on the floor of my base, telling whoever found it to please enjoy the safety they had found. Telling them the location of nearby supplies, and what it had meant to me for those few days of safety and happiness.

A storm began to pour down. By the time I had reached the town I was soaked through, but not deterred. I let fly with everything I had, but it felt like for every zombie killed, another 3 would be drawn in by the noise. That was fine though. This is why I came. So maybe someday someone else might come after, and find this treasure already cleared, or maybe just a tiny bit safer.

The battle was fierce, my rifle jammed constantly, my pistol ran dry, and then I was down to nothing but my trusty shotgun. Dropping my bags I turned to address the oncoming horde. I screamed defiance as I fired again and again. Three times I ran dry and was forced to dash into the surplus store to frantically look for more shells. Every time I thought ""This is it. This is the moment.""

But the moment never came. What did was silence. Nothing but the rain pattering on the ground and lightning cracking overhead... There were no more of them... and I was alone. ""This isn't how it was supposed to end!"" I thought. They were supposed to kill me. I was going out on MY terms... But here I was, fever building, and the rain pouring... and silence all around.

I took some time. Went to the clinic, took painkillers, sleeping pills and then collapsed on the examination table. Maybe one or two would show up late and take me in my sleep.

I woke up the next morning though. Nothing in the town. No rain, no lightning, no zombies. Just the sound of birds overhead. I wasn't depressed anymore... I was just... happy to be alive. To have seen one more day.

And so I decided to take a different path. Gathering up every sleeping pill I could, I went to the grocery store and dug through their boxes. Chips, chocolate covered coffee beans (A favourite of mine.) gummies... whatever I wanted. Why not enjoy what bit of life you have? I brought a bed outside, out into the warm sun where I could hear the birds chirp and the wind rustle the trees.... And I took every pill I could swallow... and enjoyed a few snacks. I closed my eyes on the bed, listening to the sounds of nature with a smile on my face.

Day 2: Osaka Castle, shopping, Dotonbori at night

Day 3: Day trip to Nara

Day 4: Train to Kyoto, probably in the afternoon to arrive after check in? I am looking at hotels near Gion / Sanjo station since chill energy is more important to me than convenience of being by Kyoto station. Let me know if this is a good area?

Day 5-8: We have 4 full days in Kyoto. I want to spend the mornings going to the busy spots. I’m thinking one morning starting in Arashiyama (bamboo forest, sit by the river, see some galleries), one in Fushimi Inari, one in Kiyomizu-dera.

It would be nice to have one day where we’re not rushing to get somewhere in the morning and just relax with a tea or coffee by the river. The issue is I’m not sure how to best structure my days after those morning hot spots to avoid crowds. Other places I would want to see: Ginkakuji and Kinkakuji, Tenjuan, the Imperial Palace, maybe Rurikoin Temple?  Understand I won’t have time for everything, and definitely want to allow time for just wandering and shopping.

Day 9: Train to Tokyo. From here, I’m not sure how many days to leave for Tokyo. I would like to see Mt Fuji for a day. If I catch an early train to Tokyo, then the next day go to Mt Fuji, is one last full day enough? I’m not too big on vintage designer shopping, and not sure if I’m sold on TeamLabs / Shibuya Sky city type experiences. But maybe I’m missing out?

Like there was a community of us around 20 where we coffee-hop, we did bowling, karaoke, clubbing etc. we were very attached on WhatsApp. 

I was only active for a month but I disappeared and ghosted them. It’s giving pisces energy. Anyway so I visited his place twice and we actually exchanged conversations and did deep talks but more of brother’s things. Until months ago when I reconnected DMs via Insta, I am still mutuals with some of our friends. Long story short I had him hired by my boss as a freelance marketing person for our boutique company. I’m his direct line so we message everyday about work. We also see each other once a month for in-person collaboration and each time I see him, I have a little crush on him. Lol

He dress super well. And his skin is just perfect. He’s taller than me with dark locks and thick eyebrows. He wears interesting accessories and his style is eccentric yet fashionable ykwis. There are always bits of personal conversations inserted but I did find it amusing how I showed interest in his personal life vs him to me. Other than that he said we should hang out outside of work which I said yes but he never followed up. Recently he also asked me if I know someone I can refer him to as he doesn’t like his main day job anymore. And I tried helping him sending his cv etc. like why am I helping him? I jokingly said he should give me a referral fee and he said yes lol. 

Anyway I maybe should try flirting and see how he responds. He’s straight but he seems secure of his sexuality. But i also want to go back to this video I saw that maybe it’s these people who are unattainable that I am interested in and “the chase” that I’m after. 

How to get over this litttle crush I have? Also I made his freelance contract myself. He should be doing this. But it seems like he knows I have a little crush on him bc of how a “yes man” i am to him. Thanks a bunch for reading until this",1,1771549029.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False
1r9h55s,https://www.reddit.com/r/MusicEd/comments/1r9h55s/teaching_harp_to_kids/,Teaching Harp to Kids,"Hi everyone! 

I have been playing the harp for about 9 years now (I am 30) and I am considering offering private lessons to kids (probably on the younger side since my skill level is not super high). I am looking for any advice on this because I have no idea what it would look like! 

Do young students typically attend lessons at their teachers house, or do teachers go to their house? I imagine it's weird to leave your child at a total strangers house for an hour every week (especially as I have no experience teaching yet!). How does this typically work? Do parents normally stay for the lesson too? Are there any certifications/trainings I should get to look more legit? Both on the music/teaching side as well as the childcare side. 

Would generally love any advice/information people have for someone considering going into this area of work! I work 2 days a week at a coffee shop and I have a temporary WFH job that is ending soon so I am brainstorming other income sources. I really love kids and the harp so it seems like it could be pretty rewarding if it works out!

Thanks!

I dreamt of the same hotel me and partner stayed in an old dream I had a few years ago. It was an old big hotel, Chinese-Hong kong exterior but the inside was old victorian that’s really old and clearly not being managed.

There’s an old nursery school in the ground floor, there’s no lobby area. It’s located in a somewhat hood area and I don’t know which asian country. There’s a coffee shop at the top of the hotel which only opens at 3pm. I saw the person who accommodated us in my first dream at the cafe, I was shocked to remember him. He was with his daughters and other guest which were all women.

The first dream I had with this place was horror, the hotel was completely haunted with entities. In real life I can see entities occasionally as well. No different from the dream I had last night, the people in my dream seems not to notice the entity that’s waving it’s hand to us from the hallway and also the one who’s marching back and forth outside the cafe passing by the window. Thankfully I woke up before it got worse.

Because the first dream I had with that place drained my energy. Me and partner checked in in a room in the first dream, last night we didn’t, we gone straight to the cafe. The first dream, as I can remember, there was this old lady entity that’s waving it’s is trying to open the door of the room and the energy was really heavy that it forced me to wake up very tired.

Not linear. But it is what it is. I’m at the highest weight I’ve been at in years which for some is a victory (like my therapist thinks it is) but I definitely still struggle with it. 

Nonetheless, my “disordered” habits seem to be gone, at least to myself. But lately I notice a lot of people who don’t know about my past make comments about it. At work, I don’t tend to clock out for a lunch and go on a walk instead during a few 15 minute breaks. I tend to snack rather than eat meals. The other day, my boss said I needed to start clocking out for lunch (which was super fair because the work load has definitely decreased and doesn’t require overtime) and I kind of sighed about it and they were like “what!? You never eat. Take your lunch!” 

They didn’t mean it in a bad way, probably just in the observation that a lot of other people bring their lunches back or evidence of it (fast food sodas, groceries, a coffee, etc) and I typically don’t. 

I realized it happens a lot. In fact, people tend to comment on it more now even as I’m weight restored more than they did when I was like superbly underweight. I do eat a fair amount, usually in the evenings because I prefer to eat alone, in my room, away from other people. And I do snack a lot on not the healthiest stuff. 

I don’t exactly know why it rubs me the wrong way but I think a part of me is like where was that concern when I was actively struggling, yk? Because right now I could probably say I wanted to lose some weight and people wouldn’t bat an eye because it’s just a very common thing people chat about these days. 

But yeah, anyways, I get a lot of comments on my eating habits and habits in general. Being a “picky eater” or walking a lot or not eating lunch. It’s like damn, now you notice but I feel like a walking contradiction because I’m not like… in the heart of my disorder anymore.

---


Gillian Lynd was my husband Dylan Murphy's ex-girlfriend.


This class reunion was her idea, she was the one who orchestrated the whole thing.


The private room was huge, packed with a full house of former classmates from their department.


I was there as the ""plus-one,"" sitting right next to Dylan.


Since the moment we sat down, half the conversation had revolved around Gillian.


Word was she'd landed a cushy job at some big agency and was doing pretty well as a mid-level director.


Toasts were being made in one wave after another.


Gillian held her wine glass, but her eyes kept drifting toward my side.


To be precise, she was staring at Dylan, who was sitting right beside me.


""Dylan, you really haven't changed a bit. Still the golden boy,"" a male classmate remarked.


Dylan forced a thin smile, his hand reaching under the table to secretly grab mine.


His palm was clammy.


I didn't say a word, I just let him hold it without squeezing back.


Gillian set down her glass, her laughter ringing out a bit too loud.


""Well, of course. Our Dylan was the star of the department back then.""


""So many girls were after him, but in the end, he was all mine.""


She paused for effect, her gaze locking directly onto mine.


""Sweetie, I bet you're in the dark on this one, aren't you?""


""Your husband... back in the day, for my sake, he once lay on an operating table in a back-alley clinic.""


She enunciated every single word with chilling clarity.


""He had a vasectomy.""


The air in the room went dead silent.


A dozen pairs of eyes at the table whipped around to look at us.


There was shock, curiosity, and that sick kind of excitement people get from a scandal.


I felt Dylan's entire body go rigid.


His grip on my hand tightened convulsively, his fingernails nearly digging into my skin.


His face drained of color inch by inch, his lips trembling as he struggled to find his voice.


""Gillian, you've had too much to drink!"" he managed to choke out, his voice shaking.


Gillian burst into a roar of laughter.


""Me, drunk?""


""I'm stone-cold sober.""


""Which part of what I said isn't the damn truth?""


""Don't you remember? That unlicensed dump behind the campus? The old guy who did the procedure? He just died last year.""


""Want me to give you the address? Maybe your wife wants to go check out the scene for herself?""


Suppressed snickers began to ripple around the table.


Dylan's eyes darkened with fury.


His jaw clenched tight, rage flashing across his face.


He looked at me, his lips quivering as he whispered, ""Babe, it's not like what she's saying, I...""


I just gave him a faint smile.


I wasn't going to let him humiliate himself further.


I pulled my hand back—sore from his grip—and casually dabbed my mouth with a napkin.


Then I stood up, grabbed my clutch, and gave him a brief, icy glance.


""Let's go home.""


My voice was dead calm.


Too calm, even for me.


Dylan stared at me blankly, like he was looking at a total stranger.


Gillian was stunned too.


She had likely expected me to fly into a rage, flip the table, or start a brawl.


She never imagined I'd react like this.


""Leaving just like that?""


""Honey, don't be so sensitive. It was just a joke.""


She stood up, attempting to block my path.


""It's ancient history. Dylan is doing just fine with you now, right?""


I tuned her out and walked straight toward the door.


Dylan kept his head down, following quickly behind me.


Behind us, the smothered whispers of our former classmates buzzed like a swarm of flies.


""That's it? What a buzzkill.""


""Did you see his face? White as a sheet. That story's definitely legit.""


""Her composure is insane. I don't know how she's keeping it together.""


""What's she gonna do, start a brawl? Gillian's got too much pull these days to mess with.""


Dylan's footsteps were unsteady.


He swayed behind me, looking like he barely had the strength to keep himself upright.


The moment we stepped outside, the biting night wind hit him, making he hunch his shoulders and shudder.


I stood on the steps, watching his cowering, pathetic form with ice-cold detachment.


I simply pulled mine tighter and spoke without a hint of warmth.


""Stand up straight.""


He jumped, startled by my voice, and looked up with eyes full of pure terror and shame.


He finally cracked.


""I'm so sorry, babe. I'm so sorry,"" he choked out.


""I didn't mean to keep it from you.""


""I was just so scared. I didn't know how to tell you.""


He was hyperventilating, his words coming out in jagged, broken pieces.


I remained silent, coldly handing him a tissue while hailing a cab.


I shoved him into the back seat.


Then I slid in beside him.


""Greenwood Apartments, please.""


The car pulled away.


Dylan kept babbling apologies, talking about how young and stupid he was, and how he had cut things off with Gillian ages ago.


I kept my eyes fixed on the window.


The city lights blurred past the glass in distorted streaks.


Just like our marriage over the past few years.


Shiny on the outside, but one tap and the whole thing shatters.


I didn't utter a single word.


Not until the car pulled up to our building.


I paid the fare and marched out.


He chased after me, still trying to scramble for an explanation.


""Babe, please believe me, I really—""


I didn't even look back.


""Just get inside.""


""It's freezing out here.""


We got home, and I flicked on the lights.


Dylan stood in the entryway, looking totally helpless.


""Go take a shower.""


""Try to get some rest.""


My voice was flat, emotionless.


Then I walked into my study and slammed the door shut.


I could hear him standing out there for a long time.


Then came the muffled sounds of sobbing.


And finally, the hiss of the shower.


I sat down at my computer.


The glow from the monitor washed over my face.


My expression was a blank mask.


I opened a hidden, encrypted folder.


There was only one file inside.


It was labeled ""Gillian Lynd.""


I clicked it open.


It was packed with data and images.


Every single bribe she'd taken by abusing her position over the years.


Every ""inappropriate"" affair she'd had with male colleagues at her agency.


Every project she'd illegally greenlit for her own relatives.


Dates, locations, names, amounts—even a few grainy screenshots of surveillance footage.


I had been collecting this dirt for a long time.


From the day I found out she was Dylan's ex, I'd been getting ready.


I don't have many virtues.


But I have a long memory and a hell of a lot of patience.


I don't believe in accidents.


I believe ""accidents"" are just a failure to prepare.


I created a new anonymous email account.


I categorized and reorganized the contents.


I drafted a clear, methodical whistle-blower report.


I addressed it to three different places.


The internal affairs division of Gillian's agency.


The Municipal Anti-Corruption Commission.


And the State Oversight Committee's tip line.


By the time I finished, dawn was breaking.


I hit send.


Then I wiped every trace of the activity from my system.


I walked out of the study.


Dylan must have cried himself to sleep, he was curled up in a corner of the sofa.


Half his face was buried in shadow, with faint tear tracks still visible.


I looked down at him.


I watched him for a long, long time.


I felt... nothing.


I wasn't curious about why he'd broken up with Gillian.


I didn't care why he'd gotten snipped for her.


None of that mattered anymore.


What mattered was that he lied to me.


What mattered was that Gillian insulted me.


And that was more than enough.


I flicked off the lights, went to the bedroom, and laid down.


Chapter 2


When I woke up the next morning, Dylan was already gone.


He'd left breakfast on the table: millet porridge and a side of fried eggs.


A note was tucked under the bowl.


""Babe, I've headed to work. Breakfast is warming in the pot, so make sure you eat. I'll explain everything when I get back tonight.""


The handwriting was a frantic scrawl, it was clear his head was a total mess when he wrote it.


I crumpled the note into a ball and tossed it into the trash, leaving the food to get cold.


I went about my usual routine, brewing my own coffee and toasting two slices of bread.


After eating, I changed and headed out.


I'm a project assistant at a foreign firm, it's a standard nine-to-five, and I'm rarely ever stressed.


To everyone else, I'm just an honest, unassuming woman with zero ambition.


Nobody knows where my real money comes from. And nobody knows a damn thing about my past.


That's how I like it. I prefer to blend into the background.


Like a stone thrown into the ocean—sinking without so much as a ripple.


It's the only way to deliver a fatal blow when the timing is right.


Throughout the morning, Dylan blew up my phone with messages.


Asking if I'd eaten. Asking if I was still angry.


He said he knew he messed up and begged for a chance to explain. I didn't give him a single word back.


Just as I was wrapping up for the day, my phone rang from an unknown number.


I hit answer. It was Gillian.


Her voice was frantic, with that desperate edge of someone pretending to be brave.


""Mitchell, is this your doing?"" she spat.


I pulled the phone away from my ear. ""Who is this?""


""Don't you dare play dumb with me!"" she practically roared.


""The office got a whistle-blower report today. They're accusing me of bribery and professional misconduct!""


""Internal Affairs already hauled me in! The entire office is treating me like a damn joke!""


""I can't think of anyone else who would do this but you!""


I listened, feeling absolutely nothing. The authorities were efficient, I'll give them that.


""Ms. Lynd, I think you have the wrong number. I have no idea what you're talking about.""


""If you continue to harass me with this attitude, I'll call the police.""


With that, I hung up.


She called back seconds later. I ignored it and blocked her on the spot.


I knew exactly what state she was in.


Like a bitch with its tail stepped on, she was desperate for someone to bite. But she couldn't touch me.


The report was anonymous. I'd used an encrypted foreign relay and bounced it through multiple layers, it was untraceable.


She could suspect me all she wanted, but she had zero proof. Suspicion without evidence is just impotent rage.


I didn't head straight home. I stopped by the market for a few things.


I picked up Dylan's favorites: sea bass, broccoli, and that specific brand of yogurt he loves.


I carried the bags inside to find Dylan already there.


He was still in his work clothes, just sitting there on the sofa. He bolted upright the second he saw me.


""Babe, you're home.""


He looked haggard, his eyes red and swollen as if he'd been crying all day.


""Gillian... something happened to Gillian,"" he stammered.


I set the groceries on the counter and casually unstrapped my watch. ""What happened?""


""She... someone reported her.""


Dylan followed me into the kitchen, his voice cracking.


""The agency is investigating her. She might get fired, or even... she could go to prison.""


I opened the fridge and started putting the groceries away. ""Is that so? Then she got exactly what she deserved.""


My tone was flat. Dylan burst into tears instantly.


He wrapped his arms around me from behind.


""Babe, was it you? Just tell me... was it you?""


I didn't move. I let him hold me, feeling the ragged, unsteady rise and fall of his chest.


""Why would you think it was me? I don't have that kind of power.""


""I know it was you!"" his voice turned shrill.


""Last night—right after we got back—you locked yourself in that study!""


""And today this happens to her. Don't tell me that's a coincidence!""


""Babe, I'm begging you, please help her, okay?""


He tugged at the hem of my shirt, pleading like a child who knew they'd messed up.


""She can't go down for this. It'll ruin her whole life!""


""She's an only child, and her parents are sick. If she goes to prison, what's going to happen to them?""


Slowly, one by one, I pried his fingers loose. Then I turned around.


I looked into his eyes. They were filled with pure, desperate anxiety.


But that desperation wasn't for me. It was for her.


A woman who, just last night, had ground our dignity into the dirt in front of everyone.


In that moment, my heart went stone-cold.


I'd actually thought that if he came home, apologized, and promised to be a real husband, maybe I would have turned the page.


But now, I didn't have to wonder. He had given me his answer.


In his heart, Gillian's fate was more important than my dignity. It was more important than our marriage.


""You're begging me?"" I looked at him and asked coldly. ""What right do you have to beg me for anything?""


Dylan froze. ""Babe... what are you saying?""


""She's my friend. We were classmates. I can't just stand by and watch her life be destroyed.""


""Friend?"" I laughed.


""In your heart, she's 'just a friend'?""


""The woman who made you get a vasectomy for her, and then humiliated you and your wife in public with it—she's just a friend?""


""Dylan, if you're going to lie to me, could you at least put some damn effort into it?""


My voice was not loud, but every word was like a nail driven straight into his heart.


His face went even paler than it had been at the hotel.


""I... I didn't mean it like that..."" He waved his hands in a panic.


""I just feel... I feel like she's suffered enough. We don't need to completely destroy her.""


""She's suffered?"" I took a step forward, cornering him.


""When she told a dozen people you had a vasectomy for her, did she give a damn about your suffering?""


""When she made me the laughingstock of the room, did she think about mine?""


""Now that karma has arrived, you're coming to me crying about her 'suffering'?""


I pressed him back step by step until his back hit the cold wall. He had nowhere left to run.


""Please, babe..."" He was still pleading. ""I'm begging you, just let her go.""


""Tell her office that the report was fake—that it was just some malicious prank.""


""If you step forward, they'll believe you!""


""If you just help her this once, I promise I'll do whatever you say from now on. I'll never speak to her again, okay?""


I looked at his tear-streaked face. The face I had loved for three years.


Now, it just felt utterly foreign. Utterly disgusting.


I raised my hand and gently stroked his cheek.


He shuddered, but he didn't dare pull away.


I wiped away his tears. My movements were gentle, just like they had been a thousand times before.


Because of this gesture, a flicker of hope actually appeared in his eyes.


He thought I was softening.


He thought that, like always, I would forgive him no matter what.


I leaned into his ear. In a voice meant only for the two of us, I spoke.


""Fine.""


""I'll help you.""


Dylan's eyes lit up. ""Really? Babe, you're really willing to...""


My next sentence extinguished the light in his face instantly.


""Right after I send her to prison.""


I stood up straight and looked at him coldly, watching his expression shift from hope to shock, and finally to total despair.


""The next?""


""YOU.""


Chapter 3


Dylan looked like he'd been gutted of every last bit of strength, sliding down the wall until he hit the floor in a heap.


He stared up at me with hollow, dead eyes, his lips twitching as if he were trying to scream but had forgotten how.


""What... what did you just say?""


It was as if he'd misheard me—or more likely, his brain was refusing to process the words.


I didn't give him a second glance.


I turned and walked into the kitchen, pulling that fresh sea bass from the fridge.


I gutted it, scaled it, and rinsed it. My movements were surgical.


The rushing water drowned out the sound of his muffled sobbing from the other room.


The blade hissed across the scales, a sharp, clean sound.


My mind was a stagnant pool.


Once a decision is made, emotion is a luxury you can't afford. All that's left is the execution.


Step one: Gillian.


Step two: Dylan.


Step one was already in motion.


It was time to prep for step two.


I prepped the fish, laid it on the plate, and garnished it with slivers of ginger and scallions.


I readied the steamer.


I didn't hear him approach, but suddenly Dylan was leaning against the doorframe, looking like a ghost.


His face was ashen, his knuckles white as he gripped the wood.


""Holly, you're... you're just messing with me, right?"" His voice was a gravelly rasp.


""You're just pissed off. You're saying this stuff to rattle me, aren't you?""


I didn't even look up from the steamer.


""I don't do jokes.""


""Neither of you is getting away with this. Not her, and especially not you.""


""Why?!"" he shrieked, his voice cracking into a frantic sob.


""What did I do that was so damn wrong? Why are you tearing my life apart?""


""I just... I didn't want her to get hurt!""


""After all the years we had together...""


""'Affection'?"" I flicked off the faucet and turned to face him, the knife in my hand still dripping.


""You have 'feelings' for her. What about me?""


""Dylan, look me in the eye. What exactly am I to you?""


""What has this marriage been for the last three years? Just a convenient cover?""


He fumbled for words, his mouth working but nothing coming out but empty air.


""I played the perfect wife. I cooked, I cleaned, and I treated your parents better than my own.""


""I turned down men ten times the man you'll ever be, all for you.""


""Ask yourself, Dylan: Have I not been enough for you?""


He tried to mutter about his own ""sacrifices,"" trying to play on my guilt.


He was wasting his breath.


""And that's your excuse for lying to my face?""


I slammed the knife into the cutting board with a heavy thud that made him flinch.


""Is that why you could sleep in my bed while pining for your ex?""


""Is that why you have the audacity to beg for her after she dragged my name through the mud tonight?""


""Do you think I'm just some punchline? Someone you can just play for a fool?""


He staggered back, visibly shaken by the sheer venom in my voice.


""I didn't! I swear!""


""I just... I thought she was pitiful!""


""'Pitiful'?"" I let out a sharp, hollow laugh.


""She drives a car I can't afford and lives in a house she paid for with dirty money.""


""She's got a string of side-pieces on her payroll, and you're calling her pitiful?""


""Yeah, she's in a hole now. But she dug it herself.""


""The person you're pitying isn't even her.""


""It's your own lost youth. It's the pathetic version of yourself that got snipped just to please her!""


My words were a scalpel, slicing right through his delusional self-defense.


Dylan's face went completely bloodless. He clearly hadn't expected me to have the receipts.


But I knew everything.


I knew Gillian better than he ever did.


Back in college, she was a pro at leading guys on, keeping a whole roster of ""options"" on the hook.


She only got worse after graduation.


She used her petty authority to prey on the new guys at the agency.


It was all in my files. I just hadn't brought it up because the whole thing made me nauseous.


""You... you investigated me?"" Dylan's voice was trembling.


""How long have you been watching me?""


""From the very first time you stood there and lied through your teeth, saying you didn't know Gillian,"" I said flatly.


It happened by chance.


Our first year of marriage, he took me to his alma mater for a nostalgic walk.


We saw a display of ""Distinguished Alumni"" on a bulletin board.


Gillian was the star of the show.


I'd asked him casually, ""Do you know her? She was in your year, wasn't she?""


His face flickered with panic for a microsecond before he shook his head. ""Never seen her. No clue who she is.""


Right then, I knew he was a liar.


I don't like things being out of my control. Especially not my life.


So I started digging. And boy, did I hit pay dirt.


They weren't just acquaintances, they were the campus's ""it-couple.""


The only reason they broke up was that Gillian had traded him in for a bigger fish.


And while he was marrying me and whispering ""I love you,"" he was still on her leash.


They'd even met in our house while I was away on business trips.


Looking at Dylan's shattered face, I felt no joy. Just a vast, empty void.


I once thought I'd married a good man.


I thought we could have a quiet, decent life.


Turns out, I was living in a fantasy.


""Holly."" Dylan suddenly looked up, a strange, unreadable glint in his eyes.


""You think you've won, don't you?""


""Does it make you feel powerful? Scheming against us like some kind of mastermind?""


I didn't answer. I just gave him a look that could freeze blood.


""Well, you're wrong."" A twisted, eerie grin crept across his face.


""You think sending her to prison is the end of the story?""


""Not even close.""


""There are things you can't just delete or destroy. You can't just wipe the slate clean.""


My brow furrowed. ""What are you getting at?""


""Nothing you need to worry about.""


He pushed himself off the doorframe and straightened up.


He wiped away his tears with a movement that was suddenly, chillingly deliberate.


He straightened his messy collar, his face shifting back into that refined, academic mask.


But the coldness in his eyes was new.


""I just wanted to give you a friendly heads-up.""


""Gillian isn't some lone wolf.""


""She has people. Big people.""


""You pull on her thread, and the whole damn sweater comes unraveled.""


""Do you think they're just going to let the whistle-blower walk away?""


""You think 'anonymous' means 'safe'? Holly, you're so incredibly naive.""


With that, he turned and walked out.


At the door, he paused and looked back.


""And one more thing. What's between us... it's way deeper than you think.""


""If you burn her, you burn me too. And I'm not going to let you win.""


He yanked the door open and vanished.


The heavy slam of the door echoed through the empty house.


I stood there, staring at the knife on the board.


The smell of fish and blood mingled in the air.


Suddenly, I felt bone-weary.


I'd underestimated him.


I thought he was just a lovesick lapdog, a victim of his ex's head games.


Now, he looked more like a viper in the grass.


Their connection went beyond just old flames.


They were a team. A syndicate.


If Gillian went down, he was going to lose everything too.


That's why he was so desperate. That's why he finally showed his teeth.


I pulled out a chair and sat down.


The situation was messy.


But the game? It just got a whole lot more interesting.


I picked up my phone and dialed.


""Hey, Duncan. I need a deep dive on someone.""


""Dylan Murphy. My husband.""


""I want everything. Bank statements, call logs, hotel check-ins. The last three years.""


""Yeah, EVERY damn thing. If he so much as bought a stick of gum, I want to know about it.""

1r9gs10,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1r9gs10/4_steps_to_transform_your_social_life_the/,4 Steps to Transform Your Social Life (The Psychology That Actually Works),"I spent years thinking I was just ""naturally introverted"" and bad at making friends. Turns out, I was just doing everything wrong. After diving deep into social psychology research, reading way too many books on human connection, and actually testing this stuff in real life, I figured out that most of us were never taught how to build genuine relationships. We just fumble through it and hope for the best.

Here's what actually works, no BS.

**\*\*Stop trying to be interesting. Be interested instead.\*\***

This is straight from Dale Carnegie's ""[How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034)"" (yes, it's old, but it's still the bible for a reason). The book sold over 30 million copies, and Carnegie basically built his entire career on one insight: people are obsessed with themselves. When you ask genuine questions and actually listen to the answers, people walk away thinking you're the most charismatic person they've ever met. You barely said anything about yourself.

I started doing this thing where I ask follow-up questions instead of waiting for my turn to talk. ""How did that make you feel?"" ""What happened next?"" ""Why do you think they did that?"" Suddenly people started seeking me out. The shift was wild.

**\*\*Vulnerability creates connection, not small talk.\*\***

We're all walking around wearing masks, terrified someone will see we're struggling or uncertain or lonely. But here's the thing: everyone feels that way. When you drop the facade even slightly, you give others permission to do the same.

Psychologist Brené Brown has literally built her career researching this (check out her book ""Daring Greatly"" if you haven't; she's a research professor at the University of Houston, and her TED talk has like 60 million views for a reason). Insanely good read that will make you question everything you think you know about strength and weakness.

You don't need to trauma dump on strangers. Just be real. Instead of ""I'm good, how are you?"" try ""Honestly, this week has been rough, but I'm managing. How about you?"" Watch how fast the conversation shifts from surface level to actual human connection.

**\*\*Quality over quantity, always.\*\***

Social media tricked us into thinking we need hundreds of friends. We don't. Research from evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar (the Dunbar's Number guy) shows we can only maintain about 5 close friendships and maybe 15 good friends at any given time. That's it. Your brain literally can't handle more than that.

So stop spreading yourself thin trying to be everyone's friend. Pick a handful of people you genuinely vibe with and invest in those relationships. Text them random memes. Show up when they need help moving. Remember their birthday. This is how you build the kind of friendships that actually matter.

If you want something more structured to help you internalize all this, there's an AI learning app called[ BeFreed ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450)that pulls from social psychology research, expert interviews, and books like the ones mentioned above. Type in something like ""build deeper friendships as an introvert,"" and it generates personalized audio lessons and an adaptive learning plan based on your specific struggles. You can customize the depth (quick 10-minute overviews or 40-minute deep dives with examples) and even the voice; some are energetic, others more laid-back. It's been solid for making these concepts actually stick instead of just feeling inspired for a day and forgetting everything.

**\*\*Show up consistently, even when you don't feel like it.\*\***

This is the unglamorous part nobody talks about. Friendships die from neglect more than anything else. You need to show up regularly, not just when it's convenient or you're in a great mood.

Author and researcher Shasta Nelson breaks this down in ""[Frientimacy](https://www.amazon.com/Frientimacy-Deepen-Friendships-Lifelong-Happiness/dp/1580056075)"" (she's done extensive research on friendship patterns). She found that friendships need three things: positivity, consistency, and vulnerability. Most people nail one or two but drop the ball on consistency.

Make a recurring coffee date. Join a weekly class or hobby group. Create structure so you're forced to show up even when your brain is telling you to stay home and scroll through your phone. The magic happens in the repetition, not the one-off hangouts.

Look, transforming your social life won't happen overnight. But if you start actually implementing this stuff instead of just nodding along and forgetting about it tomorrow, you'll notice shifts. People will respond differently to you. You'll feel less lonely. Your friendships will start feeling less transactional and more real.

The science is clear: humans are wired for connection. We're just really bad at pursuing it in healthy ways because nobody taught us how. Now you know better. What you do with that is up to you.",1,1771548031.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

This Saturday, the town of Havre de Grace is throwing their annual Ice Festival. This is the perfect time for our next gathering. What better way to spend a Saturday afternoon than drinking dark roast, wandering among the people and watching a bunch of wholesome ice sculptures slowly melt?

**The Plan:**

* **Where:** Concord Point Coffee (Havre de Grace)
* **When:** This Saturday @ 2:00 PM.
* **The Vibe:** We'll meet up at the coffee shop, grab our caffeine of choice, and hangout together for a spell. Perhaps we can take a walk through the festival to people-watch, enjoy the cold, and warm up the event with some hellfire.

**How to find us:** I will be at the shop around 2 and as usual I still have my blue hair so should be easy to spot.

Whether you’ve been to a meetup before or you’re a brand new misfit looking for an excuse to leave the house, come freeze with us.

Hail the Roast, Raise the Spirits! 🤘

👩 Mother

Name: Keiko Tanaka (田中 恵子)
Date of Birth: September 3, 1985
Age: 40
Place of Birth: Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan
Occupation: Corporate Administrative Manager

Background:

Keiko Tanaka was born in Yokohama and moved to Tokyo after graduating from Keio University with a degree in Business Administration. She now works as an administrative manager at a mid-sized international trading company based in Minato, Tokyo.

Professional, composed, and compassionate, Keiko is known for her strong leadership skills at work and her attentive presence at home. After becoming a mother, she carefully balanced her career ambitions with raising Aiko, sometimes adjusting her work schedule to ensure she could be present for school events and important milestones.

Keiko believes strongly in independence and education. She instilled in Aiko the importance of discipline, kindness, and perseverance. Despite her demanding career, she makes it a point to share small, meaningful daily rituals with her daughter — like seeing her off to school each morning.

Her parenting style blends structure with warmth, and she takes pride in watching Aiko grow into a confident young woman.


Story:

Morning sunlight filtered softly through the curtains, casting a warm glow across Aiko’s bedroom. The scent of freshly brewed coffee drifted faintly from the kitchen downstairs, mixing with the gentle floral perfume her mother always wore before work.

Aiko adjusted the strap of her schoolbag over her shoulder, glancing once more at her reflection in the mirror. Her navy blazer sat neatly over her cardigan, and the red ribbon at her collar was tied just right. She clasped her hands together in front of her, standing still as her mother stepped closer behind her.

Keiko rested her hands gently on Aiko’s shoulders.

“You look just like you did on your first day of middle school,” Keiko said softly, smiling at their reflection. “Nervous, but pretending not to be.”

Aiko huffed lightly. “I’m not nervous, Mom.”

“No?” Keiko tilted her head playfully. “Not even a little? Big presentation today, isn’t it?”

Aiko’s lips curved into a small, shy smile. “Maybe a little. But I practiced. I’ll be fine.”

“I know you will.” Keiko’s voice warmed with certainty. “You always prepare. That’s one of the things I admire most about you.”

Aiko’s fingers tightened slightly around the strap of her bag. “You always say that.”

“Because it’s true.”

For a brief moment, the room felt quiet and still — a pause between childhood and whatever came next.

Keiko leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss to the top of her daughter’s head. Aiko closed her eyes instinctively, comforted by the familiar gesture she had known since she was small.

“No matter how big you grow,” Keiko murmured, “you’re still my Aiko.”

Aiko opened her eyes and gave a soft laugh. “I’m not that big yet.”

“Give it time.”

They stepped apart, though Keiko’s hands lingered on her daughter’s shoulders for just a second longer.

“Do your best today,” Keiko said. “And remember, even if things don’t go perfectly, I’m proud of you.”

Aiko nodded, her earlier nerves easing. “I’ll do my best. And… thanks, Mom.”

As Aiko headed toward the door, she glanced back once more. Keiko stood in the morning light, composed and reassuring as always.

“Have a good day at work,” Aiko called.

“You too, at school,” Keiko replied.

The front door clicked shut moments later, leaving the room quiet again — but filled with the quiet strength of a mother’s encouragement that would follow Aiko wherever she went.",1,1771547664.0,AnimeAIArt,0,1.0,False

Just throwing this post out into the void looking for someone to be my other half...","Hey there stranger =)

How should I begin this ? Well, I'm a 31 year old man, looking for a committed long term relationship. The apps are terribly unkind (I've had a few matches, however) and people aren't willing to give each other a chance at all I feel. It's a bit of a catch-22 really, to build a connection with someone requires a little bit of patience and understanding, it's a two way street... So I figure I might as well try reddit, can't hurt right ?! I would like someone to show some affection and a bit of tenderness towards.

A little bit about me in dot point form:

* University educated, I have a double degree, engineering + science, now work in IT full time doing operations/infra work.
* 173cm, black hair, brown eyes, I would call myself (somewhat?) conventionally attractive. I will let you decide that of course.
* Trying to get fitter, I go to the gym 1-2x a week, I guess I am a little husky... 
* I try to get enough sunshine, exercise, sleep, water, eat lots of fruit & veg. I hope you do too !
* Friendly, chatty, empathetic, curious, deep thinking (almost to a fault), emotionally available, honest and principled is how I would describe my character.
* I prefer tea before coffee in the morning, I play acoustic guitar (but not enough, so I am terrible, still, I could sing you a song though !), I love my EDM of all varieties, and I am also vegetarian. I drink socially. I have some vices, but happy to chat about that also. Just being upfront.
* Just fyi - never been in a relationship. I hope that's not a red flag ! It just hasn't happened, for whatever reason.
* Progressive and left leaning, with some caveats, happy to explain. I believe in a higher power.
* Not a gamer, into manga, anime, or super nerdy at all. I dont mind if you are though =)
* The book I am currently reading is *Siddhartha* by Herman Hesse, nearly finished it, next on the list is probably something by Vonnegut.

What I value, and hopefully you are:

* In that 25-35 age bracket, and from Australia. I don't mind where.
* Kind, curious, emotionally available, someone that rolls with the punches and doesn't sweat the small stuff.
* Employed, full time, preferably university educated.
* Looking for a monogamous, long-term relationship, built on mutually shared values, respect, integrity, and laughter (important!).
* I don't mind your cultural background, or skin colour.
* Has an appreciation for science, art, music, technology !

1r9glex,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1r9glex/new_to_this_dialing_in_different_opinions/,New to this (dialing in + different opinions),"Hello everyone.

Just bought my first coffee machine after years of thinking about it and I've ran into a couple issues. I've tried to read a bunch but there seem to be different opinions on nearly everything. 

If anyone can help me starting up I would be so grateful. 

I've unpacked, assembled my Sage (Breville) Barista Express Impress after buying the smaller one for my parents (yeah I know it's kinda entry level but I'm entry level also lol).
The first shot was pretty much as you would expect, I went with default and paid the price.

After that I checked a bunch of articles and videos and after starting to shake from drinking a lot of (admittedly subpar) coffee I landed on:

The coffee: Medium roast 5/5 intensity 80/20 mix (I'd rather not post a link so I don't breach any rules), what I think is the roast date on the label says 05/01/2026 (checked after finding out I should, at home and kinda late for that, seems not great from what I read? ) 
Inner grind: 3 
Outer grind: around 9-10
Time: around 30s with preinfusion counted (this is where opinions seem to differ quite a lot)
Yield: 35-40ish grams 

The main issue is by this time I didn't even have an idea if it tastes good or how it should taste. It seemed to me like the coffee is really dark when starting to flow (which from the videos seems like it's not great i have no idea) and after a while it isn't silky anymore and looks like just water is pouring out. 

What should I look out for?
Should I aim for yield first (the water amount setting on my machine) and then dial in the coarsnes to be around the time (20-35s depending again on who you ask). Or is it the other way around?
Or did I just mess up on the coffee choice? 

Any pointers would be nice. 
Thank you. ",1,1771547546.0,Coffee,1,1.0,False

Just throwing this post out into the void looking for someone to be my other half...","Hey there stranger =)

How should I begin this ? Well, I'm a 31 year old man, looking for a committed long term relationship. The apps are terribly unkind (I've had a few matches, however) and people aren't willing to give each other a chance at all I feel. It's a bit of a catch-22 really, to build a connection with someone requires a little bit of patience and understanding, it's a two way street... So I figure I might as well try reddit, can't hurt right ?! I would like someone to show some affection and a bit of tenderness towards.

A little bit about me in dot point form:

* University educated, I have a double degree, engineering + science, now work in IT full time doing operations/infra work.
* 173cm, black hair, brown eyes, I would call myself (somewhat?) conventionally attractive. I will let you decide that of course.
* Trying to get fitter, I go to the gym 1-2x a week, I guess I am a little husky... 
* I try to get enough sunshine, exercise, sleep, water, eat lots of fruit & veg. I hope you do too !
* Friendly, chatty, empathetic, curious, deep thinking (almost to a fault), emotionally available, honest and principled is how I would describe my character.
* I prefer tea before coffee in the morning, I play acoustic guitar (but not enough, so I am terrible, still, I could sing you a song though !), I love my EDM of all varieties, and I am also vegetarian. I drink socially. I have some vices, but happy to chat about that also. Just being upfront.
* Just fyi - never been in a relationship. I hope that's not a red flag ! It just hasn't happened, for whatever reason.
* Progressive and left leaning, with some caveats, happy to explain. I believe in a higher power.
* Not a gamer, into manga, anime, or super nerdy at all. I dont mind if you are though =)
* The book I am currently reading is *Siddhartha* by Herman Hesse, nearly finished it, next on the list is probably something by Vonnegut.

What I value, and hopefully you are:

* In that 25-35 age bracket, and from Australia. I don't mind where.
* Kind, curious, emotionally available, someone that rolls with the punches and doesn't sweat the small stuff.
* Employed, full time, preferably university educated.
* Looking for a monogamous, long-term relationship, built on mutually shared values, respect, integrity, and laughter (important!).
* I don't mind your cultural background, or skin colour.
* Has an appreciation for science, art, music, technology !

I’m usually the type of guy who hits the snooze button until the very last moment, however, today I got up earlier than the rest of the world. Everywhere was literally chilling, and then I took a cup of coffee and went out to the porch just to see the mist disperse. That particular type of quietness you only get at 7:00 AM on a weekend, there are no lawnmowers out then, only the sound of birds and that clean, refreshing air.

It was so cold and chilly that I had to reach into the hall closet to find my old fingerless gloves. I initially purchased them randomly a few years ago, and it’s just one of those many random non-planned winter items I got on Alibaba, and they are literally just the right match for keeping my hands warm while still feeling the heat of the mug.

I simply sat up there wasting an hour and did nothing at all, no mail, no housework, just sipping my coffee and sucking up the fresh air. You can hardly feel that the world is asking anything of you, and just in that moment, that neighborhood magic begins to disappear, and now the neighborhood is waking up, but it was just the right amount of refreshing to clear my brain.",1,1771547408.0,ADayInTheLife,0,1.0,False
1r9gis9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r9gis9,My Husband's 'Stank' Was a VIP Pass to a Secret Sex Cult… So I Crashed It + Took It DOWN,"I was born with a nose like a bloodhound—I can smell something going off before it even turns.


Three years into marriage, my husband started reeking of something I couldn't place.


Not sweat. Not cigarettes. Something else. Something damn wrong.


I dragged him to get checked. Blood work, physical—everything. But the result? Clean bill of health.


The doctor actually laughed.


""Your wife's just got a superhuman nose, man.""


So yeah, I started thinking maybe I was CRAZY. Maybe I was just paranoid.


Until that night.


He left his smartwatch on the nightstand before getting in the shower.


The screen lit up.


I glanced over.


And what I saw...


The strange scent?


It ALL CLICKED IN one brutal second!


---


I've always had a freakish sense of smell.


Before food even hits its expiration date, I can pick up that sharp, sour tang of decay.


When we bought new cabinets, my family didn't notice a thing, but the chemical fumes made my head spin.


Three years after marrying Alaric Lowen, he started to... well, he started to stink.


It wasn't a gym-sweat kind of smell.


He showers twice a day, lathering up with that expensive cedarwood body wash I got him.


And it wasn't booze or cigarettes either.


He doesn't smoke, he only drinks at business dinners, and he always chomps on gum for thirty minutes before coming home.


It was this scent that's damn near impossible to describe.


Like raw pork that's been sitting out at a humid market all day, getting damp and then wrapped in plastic.


A little metallic, a little gamey, with a hint of sickly-sweet rot.


Mixed with his clean cedarwood scent, it turned into this heavy, fermenting funk.


The smell was coming from his lower body.


Every time he stripped down, the stench hit me like a wall!


I brought it up to him.


He froze for a second, then lifted his arms to sniff his pits.


""Seriously?""


""Babe, I literally just stepped out of the shower.""


He leaned in close.


""Take a whiff. You sure it's not just your nose playing tricks on you?""


He looked so damn innocent—his eyes were wide and completely sincere.


He had me questioning my own sanity.


I leaned into his neck—nothing but that fresh, crisp cedarwood.


But I knew it was still there.


Right below his waistline.


""Go wash again,"" I told him.


I pushed him toward the bathroom.


""Use the medicated soap. And scrub hard!""


He was a good sport about it and went right in.


The water ran for a long time.


When he came out, he was radiating the medicinal scent of sulfur.


The weird funk was buried—for now.


But the next day, the second he walked through the door after work, it was back.


And it was getting stronger every single day!


I couldn't take it anymore.


I started wondering if he had some kind of disease.


The kind of ""embarrassing"" infection people don't talk about.


I dragged him to the clinic for a full-body workup.


Blood work, urine samples, CT scans, MRIs—we did the whole nine yards.


While we waited for the results, I was a total nervous wreck—more than he was.


The doctor was a guy in his fifties who handed us a stack of papers with a cheerful grin.


""Son, you're in peak condition. Clean bill of health across the board!""


Alaric let out a breath and flashed me a smirk.


""See? Told you I was fine.""


I still wasn't buying it. I grabbed the reports and flipped through every page.


Every single metric had ""NORMAL"" printed right next to it.


I pointed at the charts and looked at the doctor.


""Doctor, is there any chance it's something hidden? Something the tests missed?""


""Like... something that would cause a weird body odor?""


The doctor adjusted his glasses and chuckled.


""You must be one of those 'super-smellers' I read about online, huh?""


""Trust me, your husband is healthier than most guys in their twenties.""


He clapped Alaric on the shoulder.


""It's just that your wife's got a nose like a K-9 unit. It's not a 'you' problem.""


Walking out of the hospital, Alaric kept his arm wrapped tight around me.


""You feel better now?""


""I told you I was okay. You're just overthinking things, babe.""


""Maybe you're just stressed out. How about we take a trip? Get away for a bit?""


His voice was so smooth, so comforting.


I looked at his perfect profile and started to doubt my own mind.


Was it really just me?


Was my nose so sensitive that I was hallucinating a stench from normal pheromones?


I spiraled into a deep hole of self-doubt.


For the next two weeks, I didn't say a word about the smell.


I even caught myself holding my breath around him.


I tried so hard to convince myself it was all in my head.


Alaric, meanwhile, was being the perfect husband.


He'd bring home my favorite pastries, draw me warm baths, and read to me before bed.


The more he did, the more guilty I felt.


I felt like a goddamn lunatic for ever doubting him!


Until that night.


He went to shower, mentioning he had a rough day and wanted to soak for a while.


He unbuckled his watch, put his phone down, and left them on the nightstand.


I was lying in bed, leafing through a book.


His watch screen suddenly flickered on.


A notification popped up.


I wasn't trying to snoop.


I just happened to glance over.


The message was short—just a few words.


The sender was ""Cage.""


It said: A, same place tomorrow night? Still got that ""scent.""


Chapter 2


That name, ""Cage,"" felt like literal iron bars slamming shut around my heart.


My blood went ice-cold.


""Still got that scent.""


Which scent?


The one that's been driving me insane?!


I stared at that tiny screen, my mind a total vacuum.


From the bathroom, I could hear Alaric humming a tune.


He sounded like he was having the time of his life.


I bolted upright and snatched the watch off the nightstand.


My knuckles were white from gripping it so hard.


I tried to swipe into it, but it was locked tight.


I tried our anniversary.


Invalid.


I tried his birthday.


Locked.


I tried mine.


Still nothing!


I felt like a desperate idiot trying to crack Pandora's Box, punching in every combination I could think of.


The watch locked me out.


A red warning flashed: Try again in 60 minutes.


I slammed the watch back onto the nightstand so hard it bounced off the wall with a loud crack.


Clatter!


The shower stopped.


""Babe? Everything okay out there?""


Alaric's voice drifted through the door.


""It's nothing!""


I could hear my own voice shaking.


""I just dropped something!""


I scrambled to put the watch back exactly where it was and threw my phone on top of it.


I dove back under the covers and pulled the duvet over my head.


I was vibrating, I couldn't stop the tremors.


My teeth were literally chattering.


Alaric walked out.


Smelling of steam and damp heat, he peeled back my side of the blanket.


""What's up?""


""Why are you hiding under there? You're gonna suffocate.""


His hand brushed against my forehead.


""Whoa, you're covered in a cold sweat. You feeling sick?""


""Don't touch me!""


My voice was muffled and sharp from under the fabric.


He froze.


In three years of marriage, I had never used that tone with him. Not once.


The room went dead silent for a few beats.


He let out a long, slow sigh.


""Are you still upset about the doctor thing?""


""Babe, the doc gave me a clean bill of health. Come on.""


""Can you just stop overthinking this? Please?""


He tried to tug the duvet away again.


I held on for dear life.


We were literally playing tug-of-war with a comforter.


The whole thing felt absolutely absurd.


Minutes ago, I was drowning in guilt for doubting him.


Now, I wanted him as far away from me as possible!


The mix of cedarwood and damp steam coming off him made my stomach turn.


Finally, he let go.


""Fine, fine. I'm backing off.""


""Just get some sleep. Stop letting your mind run wild.""


He lay down beside me, making sure to leave a noticeable gap between us.


I felt him roll over, turning his back to me.


The only thing left in the room was the sound of breathing.


Mine, and his.


I stared at the ceiling in the pitch black, eyes wide open.


Who the hell is ""Cage""?


Where is this ""same place""?


And what is ""that scent""?!


Questions swarmed my brain like a hive of angry hornets.


I knew it in my gut—Alaric was hiding something massive.


And whatever it was, it was tied directly to that stench.


I didn't sleep a wink.


The next morning, I got up and acted like nothing was wrong.


Alaric was already in the kitchen.


He set a plate of eggs and a glass of milk in front of me, just like any other day.


""Eat up. I made the eggs over-easy, just the way you like 'em.""


His smile was warm, his eyes were soft.


It was as if last night's tension had never happened.


If I hadn't seen that message with my own eyes, I would have fallen for the act again.


The man was a goddamn Oscar-caliber actor!


I picked at my eggs, my mind racing for a way to get back into that watch.


""Hey, babe?""


I looked up, forcing my smile to look natural.


""I saw a watch online yesterday that looked like a matching set for yours. Can I see your model number?""


He paused mid-sip of his milk.


""A watch? Since when?""


""I thought you hated wearing stuff on your wrists.""


""I don't know, I just liked the look of it.""


I pointed at his wrist.


""Come on, let me see.""


He hesitated for a heartbeat.


Then he unbuckled it and handed it over.


""It's just a standard sport model. Nothing fancy.""


I took it, pretending to inspect the casing and the strap.


My heart was drumming against my ribs.


I needed the code.


I had to get in!


I kept my voice casual, like it was a total afterthought.


""What's your passcode? The one I'm looking at needs a four-digit set, and I wanted to see what yours was.""


He looked at me, his eyes narrowing just a fraction.


""Why do you need to know that?""


""Everyone's code is different.""


""God, I'm just curious!""


I turned on the charm—the old ""sweet wife"" routine.


""What, you keeping secrets now? Just tell me!""


He stared at me in silence for a few long seconds.


Then he broke into a grin.


""Alright, alright. You win.""


""It's the day we first met. July 15th—0715.""


He said it so smoothly.


So effortlessly that I almost believed him.


But I remembered clearly: I tried 0715 yesterday.


It didn't work.


Chapter 3


My stomach dropped.


He was lying straight to my face.


He looked me dead in the eye and didn't even flinch.


My palms were sweating so much the watch almost slipped through my fingers.


I forced myself to flash a delighted grin.


""The day we met? Oh my god, that's actually really sweet!""


I handed the watch back to him.


""That's so meaningful. I'm definitely using that for mine.""


He took it back and strapped it onto his wrist.


""You're a piece of work, you know that?""


He gave my nose a playful little flick.


My stomach lurched. I felt like I was gonna lose my breakfast right there.


After breakfast, he headed out for work like everything was totally normal.


The second the door clicked shut, I bolted for the bedroom.


I needed a plan.


A way to blow this whole thing wide open.


The code.


I had to get that passcode first.


Since he lied with a ""meaningful"" date like 0715, the real code had to be something similar.


Something I should know, but that I'd totally overlooked.


I grabbed a notepad and started scribbling every number I could think of.


Anniversary, his birthday, my birthday, my parents' birthdays, his parents'... no.


None of it felt right.


What else?


License plate?


Old apartment number?


His old frat ID?


My student ID?


I filled an entire page with combinations.


A whole damn page.


But I had no way to test them.


He was glued to that watch now—he even wore it in the shower!


I had to find a way to get it off his wrist.


Something he couldn't say no to, and something that wouldn't look suspicious.


The opportunity landed in my lap sooner than I expected.


This weekend, my mother-in-law, Martha, called. It was her birthday, and we were expected for dinner.


She lives in the next town over, about a two-hour drive.


She's a real piece of work—high maintenance and incredibly traditional.


Especially when it comes to her ""wellness"" routines.


Last year, her son-in-law bought her this high-end cedar soaking tub. She's obsessed with these herbal ""detox"" baths that are supposed to improve circulation.


She loves it so much she insists everyone joins in on the ""experience"" every time we visit.


Her motto is: ""A family that soaks together, stays together.""


The tub is massive—big enough to fit three people if you don't mind getting cozy.


Every time we visit, Alaric hops in with her.


I usually fake a headache to avoid the smell of those rank herbs.


But this time, I was all in.


Because Martha has a strict ""no tech"" rule in the spa room.


She's dead serious about it.


Claims the ""frequencies"" from electronics mess with the herbal healing properties.


Saturday, we made the drive out to Martha's place.


The second we walked in, she was all over Alaric.


""Oh, my baby boy! Look at you, you're skin and bones!""


""Don't work too hard, honey. Health is everything.""


She acted like I was part of the furniture.


Par for the course.


To her, he's the Golden Son and I'm just the outsider who managed to snag him.


At dinner, she kept piling food onto Alaric's plate.


""Eat your protein, dear. You need your strength.""


Then she cut a look at me.


""And Samantha, you really need to take better care of Alaric.""


""A man works hard all day, he shouldn't have to deal with drama at home.""


""Stop being so paranoid all the time. It's bad for the marriage!""


My grip on my fork tightened until my knuckles turned white.


Alaric had clearly blabbed about the clinic visit.


""Mom, knock it off,"" Alaric interjected.


Alaric tried to shut her down.


""Looking out for him? It sounded like a wild goose chase to me,"" Martha scoffed.


She rolled her eyes.


""My son has always been healthy. He barely even caught a cold as a kid. There's nothing wrong with him!""


I kept my head down and just pushed the food around my plate.


Alaric dropped some greens onto my plate.


""Alright, Mom, let's just eat. Ignore her, Sam.""


The whole meal sat in my stomach like a lead weight.


After dinner, Martha started prepping the water for the soak.


That pungent, herbal stench started filling the entire house.


""Alaric, go get ready! Come soak with your mother!""


Martha was beaming.


Alaric nodded and started unbuckling his watch.


My heart jumped into my throat!


He set the watch right there on the coffee table.


Then he looked at me.


""Hey Sam, you joining us? Mom's been asking.""


I nodded.


""Yeah, sure.""


Martha gave me a skeptical look.


""Well, look at that! Hell must have frozen over. I thought you hated the smell?""


""It's your birthday, Martha. Of course I want to spend it with you.""


I gave her my best ""dutiful daughter-in-law"" smile.


She totally ate it up. Her whole face softened.


""Well, finally. That's the spirit.""


Alaric and Martha headed into the spa room first.


I made some excuse about grabbing my robe and stayed in the living room.


This was it!


I snatched the watch off the table. My palms were soaking wet.


I looked at my cheat sheet of numbers.


Which one?


Which one is it, you prick?!


I took a deep breath and started punching them in.


My mom's birthday?


No.


My dad's?


Locked.


The car plate?


Damn it!


The seconds were ticking away.


I could hear Alaric and Martha laughing in the other room.


I was starting to panic.


Then, it hit me like a lightning bolt.


There was one date.


A date I'd tried to scrub from my memory, but he might still hold onto.


My dog's birthday.


I had a Golden Retriever before we got married—Cooper.


I loved that dog more than anything in the world.


He was killed in a hit-and-run.


It nearly broke me.


Back when Alaric was courting me, he treated Cooper like royalty just to get on my good side.


He knew exactly when Cooper's birthday was.


With shaking fingers, I tapped the four digits into the screen.


0-8-2-1.


The screen flashed to life. I was in!

I looked up from what i was doing. She continued. Apparently warm greens, which  my photo contained, are ""visually stimulating in a way that can subtly increase anxiety during work sessions."" She then asked what i did for work, and when i said something vague about project management she nodded as though this confirmed her theory about my wallpaper. She then pulled out her own laptop, which had a completely black screen saver, and said ""i find nothing works better."" i said ""that's great"" in a tone i hoped conveyed that i had no further thoughts on the matter. She said ""you should try it for a week and see."" Then she put her headphones on and started working, apparently fully satisfied with the contribution she  had made to my morning. i sat there for another twenty minutes, finished my coffee, packed up, and walked out.

Some context, I (20F) met this guy (23M) at my old job, both of us no longer work there. We both study the same thing and are only 3 years apart. We have a bunch of things in common, we can talk for hours without getting tired.

He invited me to go see a movie with him, he picked me up and we went to have some coffee before it started, he paid for everything despite me being against it and feeling really bad about it, we hadn´t talked enough yet, so we went to a bar and kept talking until the bar closed, we stayed in his car talking right outside my house until 5 am.

Then we went to a christmas activity, once again he paid for everything despite me begging him to let me treat him. I gave him a gift and he mentioned how it seemed like that was my love language and was insanely thankful. Same thing as before happened, stayed until 5 am talking.

Then we went shopping as we both wanted to buy clothes. Neither got anything, but he offered to buy me things several times. I was telling him he´s crazy and that he´s been plenty nice enough already. We went and had dinner. Then, you guessed it, we talked until 5 a.m. Before that though, we went to the mountains to watch the stars, which I definitely enjoyed but didn´t think about my own safety, being alone with a man at 3 am at the top of a mountain once known for several murders of couples quite a lot of years ago, lol.

There was a rumor going around that, he either has or had something with a mutual friend at work, or she liked him, he shut it down pretty quickly when I mentioned it, to be honest, I was one of the people that believed that rumor, and I still kinda do.

I think I´m starting to have a crush on the guy and talked to my friend and her sister about it, they both are sure he is interested in me, my cousin says he´s just being nice and kind and I shouldn´t mistake it for something else. This is because I commented that he told me he likes doing this for his friends when he can, and every time I offered to pay, he would tell me he´d let me next time, just to not let me do so. He is very very kind to me, opens doors for me, holds my handbag whenever he sees I´m fixing my clothes or carrying several things, if it matters, he has put his hand on my back (as in rubbing my back) quite some times, which I think is sweet. But he also does some of these things for other people very frequently

Other than this, there are literally no other signs, no openly flirty comments, not a bunch of compliments or they are very vague, no insinuating comments, no mention of valentines either. I was SURE he was going out with a girl on valentines, as we were planning something and he told me he was occupied this weekend, but then told me he´s planning to see his family, and did. I´m not feeling much of that ""energy""(?) that you usually feel when you perceive someone being interested in you.

Am I just overthinking this too much? I kinda don´t care and yet still do at the same time, daily texting messes with my head and I feel like I shouldn´t even think that there is something more going on more than friendliness. I know it sounds so dumb, but there are literally no other signs

TLDR: Guy has invited me to some places and paid for everything and refusing to let me pay, no other signs that he might be interested are present, like, none at all, and he is very very kind to everyone regardless.",1,1771547116.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1r9ga6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/KidneyStones/comments/1r9ga6b/2_years_stonefree_after_3_brutal_episodes_heres/,2 years stone-free after 3 brutal episodes. Here's what actually worked for me.,"So I used to be the person who thought ""eh, I drink enough water."" Spoiler: I did not drink enough water.

After my third calcium oxalate stone — which I lovingly refer to as the one that made me seriously reconsider every life choice — I finally stopped just treating the pain and started figuring out why this kept happening.

Here's what changed the game for me:

Water. Stupid amounts of water. I'm talking 3+ liters a day minimum. I carry a bottle everywhere like it's my emotional support animal. The goal is keeping your urine pale yellow to almost clear. If it looks like apple juice, you're already behind. I know it's annoying, and yes I pee approximately 400 times a day, but I'll take that over another ER trip any day.

I stopped drowning everything in salt. This one surprised me. I always thought kidney stones were just about oxalates, but sodium is a huge factor. High sodium = your kidneys dump more calcium into your urine = more stones. I started actually reading nutrition labels and cooking more at home. You don't realize how much sodium is in restaurant food and processed stuff until you start paying attention.

Lemon water became my best friend. Fresh lemon juice in my water throughout the day. The citrate in lemons helps prevent calcium from binding with oxalate. Is it a miracle cure? No. But it's easy, it makes water less boring, and the science backs it up.

I got smarter about oxalates (without going crazy). I didn't eliminate every high-oxalate food because honestly that's miserable and not sustainable. But I cut way back on spinach (RIP my daily smoothies), almonds, and dark chocolate binges. The big trick my urologist told me: if you're going to eat something high in oxalate, pair it with calcium at the same meal. The calcium binds with the oxalate in your gut instead of in your kidneys. Game changer.

I actually followed up with my urologist. After my first two stones I just… moved on with my life and hoped for the best. After the third, I got a 24-hour urine test done and it showed exactly what was off. If you haven't done one of these, ask your doctor. It takes the guesswork out of everything.

What I STOPPED doing:

\-Stopped skipping meals (dehydration + concentrated urine = bad)

\-Stopped relying on coffee as my main ""fluid intake""

\-Stopped ignoring the fact that this runs in my family and pretending I was immune

It's been almost 2 years now with zero stones. My last ultrasound was clean. I won't pretend it's easy to maintain these habits every single day — but when I think about the alternative, the motivation comes right back.

If you're reading this after your first or second stone thinking ""maybe it won't happen again"" — please don't be me. Get the workup done. Make the changes now. Future you will be so grateful.

Or I could just tell her that I’ll be standing outside the coffee shop and I’ll pay for her parking at a meter, just wave at me when you see me

Hi, as you can see in the title i have been taking the following on SOME days:

\- L-tyrosine: 1g (taken shortly before gym OR a long study day)  
\- Pine bark 6000mg (95% proanthocyanidins)  
\- L- theanine (400mg if im expecting a stressful day) (800mg if ITS REALLY stressful, i also try have break days where I have none).  
\- Caffeine (just a coffee, not sure how much. Every morning after an hour or so of waking up).  
\- Creatine 5g every night  
\- Fish oils sometimes.  
\- Magnesium bi-glycinate before bed. 210mg, sometimes.  
\- Shilajit resin, in my coffee sometimes. I find it does give me more energy, but only paired with eating healthy and exercise.

I have noticed these supplements really help my brain function, I am autistic and ADHD and find these allow me to overcome a lot of my executive functioning difficulties.

From doing some research, L-tyrosine helps me get that extra dopamine my ADHD brain naturally lacks. The pinebark has been shown to help with ADHD in studies also.

L-theanine helps to ""mute"" my brain and allows me to better shift my focus where I need it to be. I can also experience a lot of anxiety in social situations and new situations (due to my autism), and L-theanine really helps this, I also don't experience nearly as much overstimulation.

Looking for ANY advice that could help me, any supplements I should add or avoid?.

How often should I take these? and what timing should I take these?.

Have I made any mistakes in my research?.

I am not going for perfection, but I want to ensure I am taking these in a sustainable way.

We chat about our lives and are close enough im coming to her son's birthday party, we work a demanding job doing street outreach in a pair to people who are struggling/suffering, offering them kindness and options. My coworker has a big heart and works hard, and i try to be accommodating of prayer times/holidays and we like to share about our cultures. 

currently our shift starts before sunrise so my coworker has been forgoing coffee or waking up super early, not eating or drinking during shift. I can tell it is making our job more challenging than usual and I want to do something nice for her to show her I care and that I see how hard she works and how great she is. 

I mentioned making her a Ramadan care package and she was excited. I was thinking I could make a special treat and get her something small- she loves tiny things/miniatures, maybe make her a little gift of a potholder- just a package with some small things to show I care. However I don't know much about Ramadan and would appreciate guidance as to what would be appropriate. Any input is appreciated. Also would be interested if anyone has suggestions for making our shift a little easier during Ramadan. Thank you in advance As-salamu alaykum",1,1771546229.0,islam,0,1.0,False

1r9g2ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/GATEresearch/comments/1r9g2ol/summer_camp/,Summer Camp,"Any other gate kids go to an “educational” “math and science” summer camp? (Long, get over it) 

3rd grade was the first year I was in gate, and the summer after I went to a summer camp for a week at a science and math boarding school. My parents were deciding between that and a normal summer camp and chose that, I haven’t asked yet but pretty sure it was recommended by my school, probably through the gate program. There were options for classes to choose, like a veterinarian class, cooking class, etc. (Those are what I remember cause those are the ones I wanted lol) I really wanted to be in the vet class but signed up late so I didn’t my top choices. What really makes this odd to me, besides the fact it was right on the Canadian border.. is that one of the classes was a “zombie class”. I really wanted that one too, but my parents made me put it as my 3rd choice as it was not the most educational option. Not sure why I wanted it so bad as I didn’t have much interest in that kind of stuff otherwise, but I got in. I thought it was just a silly fun thing to balance out the school of it all, but it was pretty serious. The teacher talked about the possibility of zombies becoming real, taught us how to make gas masks out of coffee filters and 2 liter soda bottles, played a game that showed how contagion works with colored liquid in dixie cups, dissected a cow’s brain for some reason, showed us videos + talked about rabies, + showed us bits of the walking dead and world war Z. Just very very odd for a so-called educational program to me. I don’t think the teacher ever flat out said “this is definitely going to happen”, more along the lines of “this very easily could happen one day, so better be prepared”, but he very well could have given my reaction afterwards. It traumatized me, I came home crying and having a hard time sleeping at night because I was convinced everyone I ever loved was inevitably going to turn into a zombie one day. Strange, but probably just the one teacher right? I don’t think so, given my other two classes. One was how to train a goldfish. We trained goldfish. And the other I don’t remember the name of, taught by the same teacher as the goldfish class, was some sort of biology class. We talked mostly about genetics, which if you know what dots to connect, is odd. Dominant and recessive traits, hair color + what it looks like under a microscope, punnet squares and all that. I remember a specific lesson about leopards or something and learning if you cut off the parent’s tail, the baby is still born with a tail. I’m pretty sure he said “the editing needs to be done in the DNA”. We dissected either frogs or squid or both. There were skittles. Normal. But two off things. One, was he talked about different physical traits and how that correlates to personality traits. Widow’s peak, something about thumbs, the shape of your lips, how far apart your eyes are, things like that all correlating to whether you were observant, outgoing, intelligent, etc. I don’t have an actual example but I’m pretty sure he got this from a specific book because I saw a video about it a few years ago and the images were the same. If I can find the title I’ll put it in later. I have since learned that this is not a widely accepted “scientific fact”, though he taught it like it was. Probably because it’s true, but regular school teachers would very much disagree. Two, towards the end of the class he had us dissect fake models of these alien parasite things from some movie “for fun”. If I looked hard enough I could probably find it but Idk the name of it, I can say the exact same looking alien type things were depicted in season 2 of the netflix live action Winx club show + they sucked the magic/energy out of people so do with that what you will. There’s probably much more I’ve forgotten especially considering I only just remembered dissecting cow brains in the zombie class halfway through typing this out but this is all plenty odd in my opinion. Why would this summer program, meant to be further education for elementary age children, be teaching us about a possible zombie apocalypse like it’s 2+2, how to train not very commonly trained animals, (which imo leans closer to mind control but I digress) and teaching third graders, who are years off from a biology class, about genetics? Not to mention teaching us what many teachers and “legit” scientists would call pseudoscience like it’s an undisputed fact (even though it is true but you get my point). I don’t know if this has any actual ties to the gate program or not but all schools have ties to the government period, and this is some real cia training, gate program type shit. What made me even think of this was seeing two separate ex-gate kids mention being recruited for similar math and science boarding high schools, so that makes me curious if anyone has had any similar experiences to mine.

I also had a sleep study years ago which showed mild sleep apnea which has also improved since losing weight.

I workout 3-5 days a week, heavy strength training. Eat healthy with a focus on protein but eat some carbs and fat.  Also supplement with vitamin Bs and Ds.  Take magnesium, zinc, coq10, turmeric and a few others.

I have done some research and thought possibly adrenal fatigue so have been hitting more electrolytes and cut out caffeine except 2 cups of coffee a day.  Also quit alcohol entirely.  But this has not improved anything and I think honestly just keeps getting worse.  I can still lift but I am fatigued enough it’s difficult to make myself and often times I’m hitting a wall mid lift.  I have taken more rest days also but again doesn’t help.

I have a doctor’s appointment next month and looking for guidance on where to start in finding problem areas.

1r9fz54,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1r9fz54/year_2_of_my_specialty_coffee_company/,Year 2 of my Specialty Coffee Company,"  
I recently launched **A Pensive Man’s Coffee** after stepping away from corporate sales to build something more intentional.

Our mission is simple: **provide a smooth cup of coffee.** No bite. No bitterness. Just complex, well-developed beans that feel balanced and clean — whether you’re starting your Day, pushing through Midday, or winding down at Night.

What makes us different is how we source.

Every coffee we offer is **direct, single-origin, organic**, and comes only from farms we’ve personally traveled to and built relationships with. We don’t buy anonymous lots from brokers. If it’s in our roaster, we’ve walked the farm, met the growers, and cupped the harvest at origin. That connection protects quality and keeps the supply chain honest.

One coffee I’m especially proud of is our **Midday**.

It’s an anaerobic-processed coffee — Done carefully, rich, vibrant, and incredibly smooth.

We roast in small batches with one goal in mind: smoothness. Controlled development. No harsh edges.

If you’re into specialty coffee and care about where it comes from — or if you’re just tired of coffee that bites back — I’d love for you to try it.

Happy to answer any questions about sourcing, anaerobic processing, or roasting.

1r9fuc8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r9fuc8,"NJ DIY wedding for 96, June 2025 ($16k)","Vibe: rustic, community event, dressy casual

We had a wonderful wedding that relied heavily on the help of friends and family: Setting up the night before, wiping benches and covering speakers when it rained, running the bouquet to me when I forgot it in the fridge, sweeping up and taking out trash at the end of the night. We made sure to tap people for help well before the event and we played an active role during the day as well.

Despite all the DIY I'm still surprised at how the costs added up to well over $10k. I'm sure savvier couples could have made the same budget go even further and more elevated in this space. Everyone's style and priorities are different - we had a wedding that was truly ""us"". But I am still a bit shook thinking what we might have had to spend if we had wanted something more traditional. Here's a breakdown of what we ended up spending.

Summary:

\- No stationary

\- No DJ

\- No videographer

\- No wedding planner or coordinator

\- Minimal decor

\- Cheap wedding dress

\- No hair/makeup artist

\- Buffet style dinner

\- No cake cutting

\- Supplied wine and beer (no hard liquor)

**Venue: $1255**

\- incl. wine and beer permit ($80)

\- 2-day (Friday-Saturday) use of site, which included an outdoor ceremony area and barn house with tables and seating (Folding chairs) for 96 people

\- Linens and yard games rentals offered with venue ($425)

**Photographer: $2400**

\- 6 hours

\- I wanted documentary style photos, with minimal posed shots and editing. I also don't like being the center of attention. We really liked our photographer Zlatko Batistich ([https://www.zlatkobatistich.com/](https://www.zlatkobatistich.com/)), who was so kind and easy to work with, and patient with my camera shy family.

**Decor: $93**

\- DIY Centerpieces ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Weddingsunder10k/comments/1lpkubw/diy\_whimsical\_flower\_and\_book\_centerpieces/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Weddingsunder10k/comments/1lpkubw/diy_whimsical_flower_and_book_centerpieces/)) materials: $45

\- Misc. decor: $48

**Florals: $1222**

\- cheap! bride's bouquet, groom's bout, and 12 bouts and bracelets from Chinatown ($122).

\- not cheap! last minute pair of floral urns and large centerpiece from a local flower shop as (strongly) requested by bride's father ($1100).

\- the latter was worth it in hindsight as it made our reception look slightly less like a Boy Scout troop meeting

**Catered Food:** $4474 + $700 for servers = **$5174**

\- incl. hot box and oven rentals as our venue did not have a full kitchen ($350)

\- cocktail hour: franks in a blanket, coconut shrimp, mini latkes, crudites, cheese, cracker, and fruit platter

\- buffet dinner: salad, pasta salad, chicken piccata, salmon filets, stuffed shells, potatoes, veggies

\- coffee and tea

\- dessert: cookies, brownies

\- We used local caterer Beyond Delicious ([https://www.beyonddeliciouscatering.com/](https://www.beyonddeliciouscatering.com/)) who delivered excellent food and wonderful servers.

\- 3 servers @ $30/hr for 5 hrs. Manned cocktail hour apps and buffet, cleaned up, cut the sheet cake, and packed up leftovers in Tupperware for guests ($700 incl. tip).

**Self-bought food + drinks: $920**

\- Beer & (boxed) wine & ice ($450)

\- Costco sheet cake x 2 ($60)

\- Cutlery b/c I insisted on ""eco-friendly"" ($140)

\- Soft drinks ($250)

\- misc. snacks ($20)

**Sound system: $2060**

\- We decided to purchase a pair of high quality, battery-powered speakers with the intention of reselling them later.

\- They are still in our closet.

\- Self-DJ Spotify for music.

\- Would renting equipment been cheaper? probably.

**Misc. supplies: $225**

\- Sunscreen, bugspray, smores ingredients ($100)

\- Umbrellas x 25 (FB, $125)

**Favors: $345**

\- 100 x 3oz. honey jars from local beekeepers ([https://emgoldbeekeepers.com/](https://emgoldbeekeepers.com/))

**Bride's dress: $181**

\- from Macy's.

\- incl. $40 hem from local tailor

**Makeup: $183**

\- in supplies as I didn't own any makeup.

\- friend did my makeup and hair for free!

**Bride's ring: $440**

\- my precious 24k gold band from Chinatown jeweler

**Groom's ring: $0**

\- used existing ring

(Groom's attire was $1000 but I didn't include it in this budget as it's part of his regular wardrobe - he's already worn it to 3 other weddings so far)

**2 connecting hotel rooms for couple + bffs, 2-nights: $940**

anyways it’s been about a year since it happened. my ex had struggled with a mental illness, i’m not going to go into detail. but it caused him to do weird things without thinking twice. he was in a treatment place after our breakup and got profesional help. he was there for about 6 months, which should be enough time to help him get better. i never blocked his number, after it happened i never felt the need to as i got told the same day by his best friend that he has been planning to go to a mental facility for help, it was only a matter of time when. he had secretly been planning it for months, and he acted up on it the day after our breakup. anyways it’s been almost 6 months since he got out. i see his posts, he looks happier almost. he asked me yesterday if i wanted to meet that same day, i did out of curiosity to see if he has changed in any sort of way, but also because i felt guilty for the breakup. not because of the reason we broke up, but i couldn’t help but think maybe i could have helped with something to make him act differently . i met up with him at a small coffee shop that we always used to go to. as soon as i set foot in that coffee shop, i saw vagdih. he looked different. more mature maybe. we talked for a bit and he told me stories about his days in the facility. after we left. i went home. he messaged me saying “thanks for today, i had fun” i replied with “of course, it was nice catching up.” i left it at that and fell asleep. i’m the morning, i got a message from him asking if we can try again. i haven’t responded yet, i don’t know what to say. he did a lot of things to hurt me in the relationship ( only mentally ) but i can see he has changed.

1r9fgn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1r9fgn1/update_why_is_it_so_hard_to_make_friends_in/,Update: Why is it so hard to make friends in Scotland?,"**\[this is a follow up post if you want to read the first one, to go the subreddit search bar and type Why is it so hard to make friends in Scotland?\]**

Hello guys and thanks so much for everyone who replied to my first post - I was feeling really down and did not think anyone would read my last post and was completely surprised by the amount of people who took the time to comment and share their thoughts.

I figured I should write a small update as so many things have happened since my last post and I will try and make it very short. **But first I want to clarify few points**. \[*If you want only the update skip to the last three paragraphs\]*

1- I did go to pups few times, at some - no one had approached me because I was alone and I guess no one would want to approach to the black guy at the pup which is fine and I totally understand.  When I did get approached people were extra friendly promised things like lets plan a BBQ or oh I will take you on a hike (when they knew I like hiking) and those things never happened and sometimes they never replied back to me when I reached out. That’s why I said I don’t like to believe people who are drinking, IDK maybe it’s just my luck.

2- I always made very specific plans and gave options. I usually text something A long the lines of “***hey I am free Wednesday and the weekend - wanted to check if you are free we can go to Edinburgh, I found this nice restaurant that I want to try. If any works for you let me know and if you prefer something nearby l like grabbing a coffee that would also work. You can also let me know if any other day would be suitable***” and I genuinely always get vague reply like - sorry I am busy but we should plan “sometime” and obviously it never happens.

3- People were asking if I had racist encounters and I don’t think I have ever had a covert experience however, I do feel the subtle racism that comes across from the way people look at me sometimes or talk to me .. this is hard to explain you just have to be of other ethnicity and experience it to understand. But yes I did feel excluded most of my time in here.

4- Its was not clear from my post but I did actually explore Scotland, I did a few Munro’s - Ben Chonzie was my first and so far favorite. I went as far as Inverness and The fairy Pools in the Isle of Sky. And I also visited most of the main cities of Scotland - I go to Edinburgh almost every week and I always discover a new thing to do but even when I meet people in Edinburgh I find that they are immediately put off when they know I live in Fife as most of them can’t/don’t drive.

**And now to the actual good part …**

Few people had reached out to me and shared their story which was great, it genuinely made me feel that I am not alone in this and that nothing is wrong with me - what I have been going through made me think I was the problem and made me very insecure so knowing that other people have been going through the same thing is sad but also a huge relief somehow.

And last but not least, a couple of people have reached out .. some of them are geographically closer than others and we are chatting and planning things - there is at least one coffee meeting on the near future which I am really looking forward to. 

**Thank you Reddit so much for all the kindness and the support that I have got you guys really made my week better and I am looking forward to better new chapter for my life in Scotland. I hope.**",21,1771544711.0,Scotland,3,0.77,False
1r9fglu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cognitivesurrealism/comments/1r9fglu/have_i_ever_told_you_about_my_living_room/,Have I ever told you about my living room?,"Have I ever told you about my living room?

It’s large, it’s modern, it’s the best there is—always. I never go cheap. Not because I can’t, but because I choose not to. It’s different. It’s important. It’s discernment.
My furniture does not come from your usual furniture store. No, mine comes from private stocks. It hasn't even been released to the masses yet.
Look at this coffee table. Look how refined, look how noble it is. It has taste. It has manners. It has culture.
It’s not a table—it’s an earl. It’s a duke. It’s landed gentry. It owns its own space because I let it. It’s different. It’s important. It’s discernment.
Look how symmetric it is.
Even Euclid would be jealous. 
It defies the laws of geometry. Money can do that. Money can do anything. You just need enough of it.

Have I ever told you that I enjoy long soliloquies after a glass of Chardonnay?

Building skills are so important, yet so overlooked.
You don’t build a coffee table that expensive by being careless, by being senseless, by being reckless. No. You need to be conscientious. You need to be serious. You need to be meticulous. You need to be a cold-blooded killer. You need to be an algebraic lion of sheer accuracy. You need to spread fear. You need to show dominance by roaring numbers, by roaring letters—thunderously.
Math is everything. You can’t build anything proper without it.
I haven’t built any coffee table, but I’ve built a sound, a solid, a stable life.
My career’s very Gothic. It’s strong. It’s serious. It reaches high. I thought it through. It’s well-engineered. 
It has rib vaults, flying buttresses, stained-glass windows. It’s serious work. It’s proper work. That’s what I do.
Just take a look at my daughter. She’s really well built. My wife and I have really good genes, so we only used the best material. Dominant genes run in the family. She breaks down sugar easily. She has great mitochondria. Very efficient. Sugar breaking is important.
You can’t make good deals if you can’t break sugar properly. Everybody knows that. It’s basic science.
That’s why she’s strong and stable, like a good house. She’s a good house—proper. We ticked everything. Wind load. Live load. Dead load—the lot. I’m particularly proud of the brickwork. French bonding style. That’s why she’s tough. That’s why she’s bricky. Her name is Becky. She’s equipped for life.
Not to mention the roof. People keep staring with envy. They keep bugging me. They keep badgering me to get the architect’s phone number. You’re standing in front of him, you idiots.

Ironic.

My daughter’s roof’s a mansard roof. Very Parisian. Very distinguished. Very baroque. It’s the Champagne of rooftops—very fizzy, very pricey, very tasty.
My darling and I followed a very strict and ambitious scale model for our daughter. That’s what we did. That’s why she’s the way she is. That’s why she’s smart, disciplined, goal-oriented.
That’s because we constructed her with rigor, with coldness, with ice. We built her the right way. Who cares if she has traumas? Who cares if there’s nothing but winter in her eyes? What matters is resistance to inclement weather. What matters is soundness - - not happiness. Anyone with halfway decent grey cells can understand this. It’s basic, very basic. It’s high potential hydrogen. Twelve or thirteen—ballpark.
Maintenance is where people fail.
They think construction is enough. They think once it’s standing, it’s done. Amateur thinking. Temporary thinking. Weather-blind thinking.
Everything needs inspection. Everything needs revision. You don’t trust a structure just because it passed once. You monitor. You audit. You stress-test. You wait for the cracks to reveal themselves. And if they don’t, you induce them. That’s how you know it’s sound.
I run annual checks. Seasonal ones too. Winter is the most honest season. Cold doesn’t lie. Cold reveals tolerances. Cold tells you what was overpromised.
I watch closely. I listen. A good structure speaks if you know how to hear it. Micro-fractures make a sound. Emotional ones too. Very similar frequency, actually.
People say, “She seems distant.”
No. She’s insulated. Triple-glazed.
People say, “She doesn’t open up.”
Of course not. Load-bearing walls don’t open. That’s the whole point.
I gave her routines. Very precise ones. Same time. Same angle. Same pressure. Every day. Repetition creates alignment. Alignment creates strength. Strength creates predictability. Predictability is peace.
She doesn’t improvise. Improvisation is how things collapse. Look at bridges. Look at empires.
Sometimes she asks questions. That’s normal. Buildings creak too. I answer with data. With diagrams. With precedent. 
Precedent is comforting. It reassures the structure that others have stood before it and survived.
Emotion is weather.
Weather is a variable.
Variables must be controlled.
I taught her that.
People think warmth is necessary. It’s not. Warmth expands materials. Expansion leads to deformation. Deformation leads to weakness. Weakness leads to failure.
Cold preserves.
Cold sharpens.
Cold keeps edges clean.
She’ll thank me later. When storms come. When others buckle. When roofs cave in around her and she remains vertical, impeccable, untouched.
They’ll call her “resilient.”
They’ll call her “remarkable.”
They’ll ask how she does it.
And she’ll stand there, perfectly plumb, perfectly aligned, not saying much.
Because well-built things don’t explain themselves; they just are. ",1,1771544709.0,Cognitivesurrealism,0,1.0,False

Sorry for such a long post, I’ve tried writing for the past day and short it down as much as I think I can.

I (21f) have always had this weird fear of hiking on cliffs or mountains, well, anything with heights, with people. I don’t hike all that often, but I do it like a few times in the spring and summer. But if it’s on heights, I can’t do it when I’m with people. I don’t care if it’s my best friend, someone I barely know, my mom, I can’t do it with anyone. I have this weird and sinking feeling just thinking about it. I have this idea that at any given moment, they could just push me off a cliff. They could flip out and kill me.

I trust people overall, I don’t have trust issues or any trauma. It’s just a big fear of mine. This has never caused any problems at all, since like I said before, it’s something that rarely happens, maybe five times a year or even less. 

However, my boyfriend (26m) loves hiking. It’s something everyone in his family loves to do and has always done. This last year, he tried to get me to hike with him, it’s a hiking trail I’ve taken a few times myself, but it’s really really high up and so many cliffs. I always told him no, I made up excuses or other things to get out of it, because most often he didn’t just take the no. He thought it was weird I didn’t want to do it with him, considering I’ve done it myself before. I also want to say that we’ve done a few hikes together, but it’s shorter hikes and usually not on any taller heights.

This past weekend, he started talking about doing this hike during the early spring. He really wanted me to tag along and I told him no. He pestered me about why, and told me there had to be a reason for it. After he had nagged me about it so many times during both Saturday and Sunday, I decided to sit him down. I tried explaining my fear, constantly pointing out that it’s not that I think that he will kill me, it’s just a fear of mine that I would have with literally anyone. At first he told me that I needed to get it over with, that if I just went with him one time and came down alive, I would know my fear is irrational and get over it. The thing is, I know it’s irrational as hell. I know it, I know no one will kill me, but I just can’t stop fearing it. After I still refused, he got kind of upset with me.

He’s been upset this whole week. He’s been making remarks about it all the time. For example, I asked him if he wanted to go with me to the bathhouse (I think that’s the correct word in English, sorry). He said he wouldn’t, as I was probably afraid he would drown me in the swimming pool. He refused to pour my coffee for me, something he has always done otherwise, as I would probably be afraid that he would dump the hot coffee on me. There has been so many other remarks like these.

Should I just have made up another excuse again? Or went along with his idea of just hiking with him once and see if my fear gets over? Or is he overreacting to this and being mean? I’m starting to feel like I made him think I see him as a potential killer, when I don’t.",5,1771544518.0,AITAH,12,0.86,False

someone said their doctor recommended exercise for mental health and it's made a big difference for them.  i walk a lot but also have dumbbells i rarely ever use and a quick lift in the morning doesn't have to be a big deal to get some exercise in.  i did a yoga stretch routine first and a couple of floor ab exercises and planks but i'm so out of shape and oversized that yoga for me is really just stretching and for posture and balance.  nothing impressive in my yoga routine but i do have a pretty good downward dog.  the only lifts i did were standing rows and deadlifts because i got lazy and didn't know what else to do.  i'm going to look up some routines for tomorrow on youtube.

i had my [oat bowl](https://imgur.com/nvpaHQd) and a coffee, took a shower and went on the late morning [dog walk](https://imgur.com/2YVlRla).  there was another dog and owner who came with us and we took the long route.  it's enough exercise to get out and moving but i still think i need more in the day.  i really also need to work on my weight, i think things would be a lot easier if i were thinner and it would just improve my quality of life.  after the walk, i brought a coffee and bran muffin to the library for a [study session](https://imgur.com/H3Bf8Mr).

i don't even know if what i studied was important i just want to be able to do it and focus and have some recall.  it was the respiratory system, so asthma, COPD, pneumonia and a few other topics as well as meds.  beta-adrenergic agonists (SABAs and LABAs like albuterol/ventolin), corticosteroids (fluticasone) and others.  i don't know.  i took notes, i studied, i was there working for a couple of hours.  i'm sure it did me some good even if i still don't know anything.  after a while i got sort of tired so i took a study break to go to dollarama which is nearby at the mall.  i visited all the [junk foods](https://imgur.com/09IUGoC) i'd like to have while i study and saw a [product](https://imgur.com/ThXVpLt) i might actually buy one day.  i went back to the library and did another 45 minutes of note taking before deciding that was enough.

back home i made some food and was inspired by the kraft pizza kit i'd seen.  i had planned on making a bunch of naan breads today already, but also have cream cheese and some old leftover canned tomato my mom never used for something so i was going to make a pizza sauce and have cream cheese naan pizza.  unfortunately, the tomatoes had gone off and i didn't want to open an entire can of spaghetti sauce for my pizza.  instead i had the [weird idea](https://imgur.com/Txy67cC) for a chicken, cream cheese, coleslaw naan wrap.  it was good enough but not something i'd put into regular rotation.  i had a [baby naan](https://imgur.com/bp8LOfP) with some spinach dip and the last of the [pancakes](https://imgur.com/8MfgRsX) from family day this past monday.  no regrats.

the last of the day was the evening [dog walk](https://imgur.com/YfkuSzS) and molly took forever smelling things and trying to eat grass because it might be the first time grass has even been visible all winter.  i appreciated that the sun was still up and my fingers weren't frozen by the end.

1r9fd28,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1r9fd28/the_cinnamon_roast/,The Cinnamon Roast,"# The Cinnamon Roast Profile

This is pretty much where I live 90% of the time on my SR800 with Razzo chamber. Reading about the extended time in the article confirms my suspicions about stretching out the roast before I hit first crack after the 8 minute mark with really light roasts with a short DT. All my roasts for pout overs are in the 10-12% range for weight loss.

**What is a cinnamon roast & why do roasters choose it?**

Although it may occasionally come under a different name, a cinnamon roast is generally considered the lightest possible roast profile for a coffee.

Coffees roasted to this degree are often very acidic in the cup, with little balance. The body and mouthfeel are often very light and delicate, while flavour notes are typically described as “grassy” and “peanutty”, with low sweetness and a floral aroma.

Daniel Horbat is the founder of [Sumo Coffee Roasters](https://www.instagram.com/sumocoffeeroasters/?hl=en) in Dublin. He founded the roastery after being crowned World Cup Tasters Champion in 2019. He tells me that as well as origin, cinnamon roasts tend to be more profitable for roasters due to the high moisture retention in the beans.

“The biggest advantage of cinnamon roast is the fact that coffee retains the terroir characteristics,” he says. “Coffee will be brighter and retain much more complex flavours of the coffee fruit.

“Another advantage is the reduced coffee loss compared with a darker roast, since it loses less moisture, resulting in a higher quantity of roasted beans.”

Indeed, coffee can lose between 12% and 24% of its weight during a roast depending on various factors, such as initial moisture content and roast temperature. Generally the lighter the colour reading, the lower the weight loss. This means roasters can pack fewer beans into the same sized bag, generating a greater profit per batch.

Daniel also says that cinnamon roasts are often popular among consumers looking for coffees with a high content of antioxidants. According to [a study published in the *Journal of Medicinal Food*](http://www.liebertpub.com/global/pressrelease/does-roasting-level-affect-the-antioxidant-and-anti-inflammatory-properties-of-coffee-beans/2201/), lighter roasts contain higher concentrations of chlorogenic acid, which helps protect against human cell damage and inflammation.

“The bold, fruity, and floral flavours of a light roast coffee tend to be very exciting, and this is why we, at the roastery, mostly roast light and light-medium coffees,” he says. “In addition to this, light roasts also tend to have more antioxidants present in the beans.”

In a cinnamon roast, it is rare for the internal temperature of the beans to reach 400°F (204°C)

# A few things to consider

Cinnamon roasts may suit certain coffees – but it’s not for everyone.

According to coffee author and roast consultant Rob Hoos, a coffee’s roast profile is closely tied to the sucrose content caramelised during a roast. Generally speaking, the lighter the roast and the lower the temperature, the less sucrose will be caramelised.

If the development is too light, which is often the case with cinnamon roasts, pyrolysis of some compounds may not properly occur, giving the coffee vegetal tones in the cup. This is because the internal temperature of the coffee beans will not have reached 400°F (204°).

On the other hand, too much caramelisation and, eventually, too much pyrolysis, leads to an excessive amount of bitterness, which flattens the complexity of the coffee.

Daniel explains that when roasting light, it’s important to develop the coffee in a way that highlights the inherent flavours, rather than bringing out unwanted characteristics such as sourness. 

To do this for a cinnamon roast, it’s best to start at a longer temperature and very gradually work up to 400°F. This longer roast time provides a greater opportunity for the acids and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the beans to release, providing a better quality roast.

Whether roasting light, medium, or dark, it’s important to find the right coffee packaging for your beans

For roasters, finding the perfect roast profile for each coffee is a fine art that can take a while to finesse. Where one may be suited to a cinnamon roast, another might benefit from a longer development time.

But if the character is called a villainess in universe, it should mean a separate thing to the characters themselves.

  
At the start of a manga i'm trying, the main character is called a villainess because she harshly refuses social gatherings because she like coffee but women in her country only drink tea and its un-womenly to drink coffee. But the only people that know her reasoning are the royal family and their servants, so the people calling her a villainess aren't using the genre meaning of the word. But later in the manga, villainess is then being used to describe a prostitute or whore in a completely different instance (for women that go to bars or taverns by themselves late at night because why else would they be there).

Is this a case of the manga having bad world building, an incredibly shit translator, or am I just misunderstanding something?

I have a few:

1) Didn't book a next step or your prospect ghosted you after a good amount of time went into it? Book in a meeting without asking - with an *optional* invite. **100%** they will see it. Make sure it's five minutes long and is *optional*. 

Bonus tip = put a $10-$20 coffee / lunch voucher in the invite, get creative. Throw some emotes in the subject line. If you didn't build any rapport with them, then don't bother.

2) Waiting in a meeting for someone to join? Instead of checking yourself out on the camera - start connecting or following their colleagues on linked in - in two mins you can connect with 10+ people and ask them if they want the notes from the meeting. Easy multithreading done. Make sure to add them to a custom list so you can go back to them later.

3) Shared a proposal and can track it online? As soon as a prospect opens it the **second** time call them - on their mobile. Shared it with a colleague, call their mobile too. 

4) stop writing long proposals, no-one reads them and most buyers have done 95% of their research already. stop using chatgpt to write, it sounds like utter shit. 

5) Don't use sales tips from linked-in that have 1000s of likes or require you to comment. Why? It's like buying a stock after the hype hoping it'll go up. Also it makes you look like a desperate chump when people see you doing it.

**Chapter Three: The Big Nothing**

Now the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide  
The fortune telling lady has even taken all her things inside  
  
Bob Dylan – ""Desolation Row"" 1965

The grass strip lay ahead like a beacon through the trees, half-mowed, half-wild. I dragged it once at pattern altitude, scanning for wires or deer too dumb to know they’d inherited the earth. Nothing moved but weeds.

I throttled back and slipped in, wheels thumping over uneven sod. Four-Alpha-Lima rattled to a stop near a sagging hangar, its doors yawning wide. Inside sat a rusted tractor, a pile of tires, and something better, two fifty-gallon drums with a hand pump leaning against them. I sumped a little fuel to be sure: clean, clear, no water, no floaties. Good avgas, sharp on the nose.

I caught myself grinning. “I love the smell of avgas in the morning.” Luck was still out here, hiding in the corners.

Next to the hangar sat an old card table and a chair bleached soft gray by the sun. A box of oil rags had collapsed into the weeds. Once, this had been a gathering spot for kindred spirits. Saturday mornings meant hangar flying, cheap coffee, pancake breakfasts, and poker runs. You could almost hear the scrape of folding chairs, the laughter of old men arguing about the weather. Now it was just me, the table, and a couple of squirrels prairie-dogging in the grass like they owned the place.

I pulled the sectional maps from my flight bag, spread them across the table, and weighted the corners with spark plugs scavenged from the hangar floor. It was the work I’d meant to do back in North Tonawanda, but the chase had stolen that chance. The plan was simple: keep the tanks fat, watch for weather and bad guys. Everything else was just details.

As I planned my route, a crow, black as midnight in a bad dream, landed on the split-rail fence at the edge of the field. It preened once, then stopped, turned its head, and stared me down. Its eyes were ringed with red. I’d seen a million crows in my life, but never one like this. “Hello, Mr. Crow,” I muttered.

The bird cawed, taunting, daring me to do something. I grabbed a rock and hurled it with everything I had. Missed badly. Mr. Crow just stared, unblinking. I threw another. It smacked the rail beneath him, and the bird answered with its ugly song before taking to the air, leaving a thunderous silence in its wake.

I was completely rattled and not thinking right. I took a deep breath, ran my fingers through my hair, and sighed. The last few hours had been more excitement than I’d cared for, or bargained for.

I didn’t really need fuel, but I stared at the drums and thought of my father, my first flight instructor, lost to the Super Flu. He’d have said, “Stick and rudder’s the easy part. It’s thinking that keeps you alive. Never leave fuel behind if you don’t have to.”

I didn’t have to think twice. With Dad fresh in my mind and the crow gone, I pulled a ladder from inside the hangar and topped off from one of the drums the previous owner had left behind. Then I made my best plan of the day: an overnight on this quiet little strip.

I settled my nerves, sat at the flimsy card table, poured a cup from the thermos, flattened the maps, and got to work. Half an hour later, I traced the route, short hops, easy legs, fuel wherever I found it. “Three full days,” I muttered to myself. “If nothing breaks.” But something would.

With reality as my guide, I logged my path meticulously, notes for my kneeboard, like a Triple-A Trip-Tik. A fluorescent pink line marked my route through the heart of what used to be the United States of America. My first stop would be a small strip in central Ohio. I’d start the day with six hours of fuel for a three-hour flight. No issues there. I pre-folded the maps. Any pilot will tell you there is nothing worse than fucking with a map while in the confines of the cockpit.

Flight planning done, I gave Four-Alpha-Lima a quick preflight, then settled in to watch the day wind down.

Dinner was simple: a can of Hormel beef stew heated over Sterno, no open flame, nothing that might draw attention. Ritz crackers and fruit cocktail rounded it out, comfort food in a cold world. Belly full, I snuffed the flame and crawled under Four-Alpha-Lima’s wing. I spread my sleeping bag on the cool ground, where I could look past the struts and see the stars, hard and bright against the black.

For as long as I can remember, the night sky had been washed out, drowned by streetlamps, headlights, billboards, the relentless glow of cities. Now it was revealed. A billion stars I’d long forgotten burned overhead, each one a reminder that our world was smaller than the noise we made. The sky as it was before we ruined it.

The wing above me felt like shelter, the stars, a thousand silent eyes. For the first time all day, I let my shoulders drop and told myself I’d rest them for a minute.

But the body doesn’t ask permission. Somewhere between watching satellites crawl across the sky and searching for Orion’s Belt, the stars blurred. My eyelids sank, and I dropped fast, straight into the kind of heavy sleep that only comes when you’re too tired to fight.

Mother Abagail came to me first, plain as day, a bubbe at the kitchen table.

“You’re on the right path,” she said, her voice soft but steady. “But the sky won’t always be kind, not tomorrow, maybe the next. Watch for the change. Be careful, child.”

“The girls?” I asked before I could stop myself. My throat was tight, the words more plea than question. Her eyes, bright, rheumy, met mine. “God has not shown me that, child.” Nothing cruel in it, but no comfort either.

Mother Abagail faded like a special effect in a bad movie, and something new slithered in. I couldn’t see his face, but I felt his shape in the dark, smiling without warmth. He didn’t speak so much as laugh, low and mocking, like the game was already his.

“Your weather girl wouldn’t know a breeze from a storm if your life depended on it. She tells you to watch the skies; pray to a God who won’t show your children to her dying eyes.” He paused, almost laughing. “I can tell you if Abby and Leah have been naughty or nice.”

Where did this faceless thing get my daughters’ names?

Hands spread in a mocking “come on” gesture, he backed into the smoke. The last thing I saw was a pair of red eyes before the dark folded over them.

I turned away and tried to call Mother Abagail back, but she was gone. Only a shadow remained, a murder of crows breaking apart overhead.

I woke with a jolt as the sun rose over the eastern fields, foggy and unsettled. The dream was already fraying at the edges, but the sound of my daughters’ names, twisted by something evil, refused to fade.

I sat in the dew, heart pounding, convincing myself it was only a dream, my mind serving up a stress burger. But that voice, dripping with mockery and disdain, had come from somewhere dark and vile, a place I couldn’t name.

I stayed there for a moment, letting the sunrise burn off some of the chill the dream left behind. My hands shook, and I couldn’t tell if it was from the cool morning air or what I’d heard.

I pushed to my feet, brushed the dew from my jeans, forced myself into motion. Routine was the only way to stay steady. Coffee. Fuel. Charts. Keep the machine moving, because if I stopped too long, the shadows would start talking again.

I policed the area, cleaned and stowed my gear. With the sun burning off the morning mist, I laid out the chart one last time. Even with the best pilotage, one grass strip looks much like another on a sectional map. Triangulating as best I could, I put myself on Old McDonald’s Farm strip just outside Meadville, Pennsylvania, E-I-E-I-oh.

My next stop was Mansfield Lahm Regional (MFD), about 150 nautical miles away. I traced the pink line southwest on my sectional: course two-five-zero degrees, ninety minutes at seventy-five percent power. First checkpoint, Meadville Reservoir. Then I’d cross I-79, cut inland, and if my dead reckoning held, I’d spot Tiffin just before the hour mark. From there, Mansfield would be hard to miss, long runways, an old Air National Guard and general-aviation field. Tower frequency, one-one-eight-point-two-five. Back in the day, it would’ve been a simple trip, but nothing was routine anymore. One nice thing, the landscape was dotted with small airports along the way. If I had to land, I had plenty of choices. I officially marked Finley (FLY) as my alternate, just in case something spooked me at MFD.

The winds were calm and the sky was cloudless. A good sign, but no way to know what the weather looked like 170 miles away. Gone were the days I could call Flight Service for a briefing or count on a pilot report en route. My only clues now were clouds and wind.

With the details neatly copied to my kneeboard, I got serious about departure. Whatever wasn’t already gathered, I stowed. A quick walk-around confirmed nothing had fallen off my plane while I slept. I moved each control surface by hand to check for binding, peeked inside the cowl to be sure no critters had made it a cave, and drained a little fuel from each tank to make sure no moisture had crept in.

Tasks complete, such as they were, I was ready. I’d positioned Four-Alpha-Lima to taxi straight to the end of the runway. No breeze, no noise-abatement rules anymore, closest was best. I climbed into the cockpit and settled in. Unlike home base, this time I had the luxury to do it right.

I ran my checklist. Master on. Gauges green. Mixture full, carb heat off. Prime the engine; fuel selector to BOTH. Feet on the brakes. Turn the key. She caught on the first blade, a cough, a bark, then a smooth idle. I let her purr a minute. Nothing makes me happier than an easy start.

Mag check. Carb heat test. Auxiliary pump on. Mixture full rich. All good: gauges steady, fuel and oil pressure solid, temps coming up. Ready to go. I taxied to the end of the strip and set up for a short-field takeoff. Brakes firm, throttle full. The engine strained, the wheels wanting to roll. At three thousand RPM, I released the brakes and shot forward. In less than seven hundred feet I hit rotation speed, pulled back on the yoke, and felt the wheels slip free of the earth.

I leveled the nose to build speed in ground effect. Reaching the far end of the runway, I eased back on the yoke and settled into a steady, comfortable climb.",1,1771543749.0,u_Alternative-Bake-611,0,1.0,False
1r9f2vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1r9f2vy/i_spent_two_years_fighting_bad_breath_and_finally/,I spent two years fighting bad breath and finally figured out the cause. I feel like an idiot.,"Some context: I (34M, married) have been dealing with this for probably two years now. My wife never said anything directly but I noticed her subtly turning her head sometimes when I leaned in to kiss her good morning. That was enough for me to know something was off.

I did everything right, or at least I thought I did. Brushed twice a day, flossed, used mouthwash, switched toothpastes three times, cut out coffee for a month, drank more water. Nothing changed in any meaningful way. I even went to the dentist twice thinking it was a cavity or gum issue. He said everything looked fine.

Last week my wife forwarded me some random article about oral hygiene without comment. Just sent it with no message. Very subtle. In the article there was a section about how the tongue is responsible for the majority of bad breath cases because of the bacteria that builds up on its surface, specifically toward the back where most people never clean.

I have never once in 34 years cleaned my tongue intentionally. I brushed over it occasionally by accident but that is genuinely it.

I bought a tongue scraper the same day. The first time I used it I will not describe in detail what came off but it was a religious experience in the worst possible way. I've been using it every morning for a week now and the difference is noticeable. My wife kissed me on the mouth unprompted this morning for the first time in I don't know how long.

If you brush your teeth twice a day and still feel like something is off, please just scrape your tongue. It takes 20 seconds. I lost two years to this.",16,1771543735.0,cheating_stories,14,0.81,False
1r9f2iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1r9f2iw/self_renovation/,Self Renovation,"Deep in the insignificant, The orthodox, the plain.

Is a broken-down house under layers of peeling paint.

An ancient beast, hungry, lays at rest,

Forever hinging on its final breath.

Its walls bulge with the weight and wares

Of the indulgent pack rats living there.

Every crevice of the shower is a sickly pink,

With nice, matching dishes piled in every sink.

Multicolored walls with scrapes and holes

Covered up with the pictures, framed and full.

They’ll fix it up soon, as the story goes

But still the beast remains, a house, a home.

Behind a curtain, where a door should lie

A girl sits at her tidy desk with too bright of eyes.

She gulps down bitter coffee from a paper cup,

Facing the day, trying her luck.

Her fingers like lightning against the sticking keys,

Aimlessly chasing a future she wasn’t taught to see.

The sickness, the beast, bites at the back of her mind,

Begging her to stay inside.

The walls insist she joins her mother in inaction,

Or accompanies her father in his distraction.

But her greasy hair, nor battered mind, nor bottle in her closet.

Her wrinkled clothes, nor stuffy nose, could never truly stop it.

For surrounded by the rotting love they didn’t know would hurt her

She had learned to see the abandoned dreams, the futures this beast had murdered.

But she'll never let the world see the insides of these walls.

So, she washes her hair in the bathroom sink and picks herself up when she falls.

She walks out the door in her best thrifted sweater and makeup painted face.

She’ll fight for a dream she barely knows, a future she'll blindly chase.

Hey all! I'm 6 weeks post RALP. My question to everyone here is this:

I'm having these terrible swings! It took a little over 4 weeks for me to start to feel like I was having some improvement, but then I hit a couple days where I had probably 75% control! I felt elated! Then the next day it went exactly the opposite! I never really went to the bathroom for the next 2 days because I was simply urinating into my pad with no control whatsoever! All I did in the bathroom was change pads. Then I had a couple days where I had some decent control again, only to revert right back to no control and emptying into my pad uncontrollably yesterday and still going on today!

I know I'm still in the early stages and I have a long way to go, but has anyone here had that same kind of swing from bad to good and back again? I'm so worried I'm doing something wrong! BTW...I'm not drinking coffee, soda, or alcohol; mostly just water with an occasional glass of milk thrown in, and I've really tried to cut down on salty foods.",1,1771543469.0,ProstateCancer,1,1.0,False

I'm Elizabeth. This is my first time posting here. I’ve been living in the Longview/Kelso area for a while and wanted to introduce myself!

I’m currently looking for part-time or full-time work and thought I would reach out in case anyone has leads or recommendations. Most of my experience is in remote Customer Success roles, but I’ve worked in a variety of areas ranging from coffee shops to customer service. I’m dependable, organized, and genuinely enjoy helping people.

I’m mainly looking for something steady and with low risk for burnout. Retail, local business support, customer service, or behind-the-scenes roles like inventory or fulfillment would all be great. I’m also very open to learning something new if it’s a good fit!

If you know of anywhere hiring, or places that are good to walk into and introduce yourself, I would really appreciate it. Even general advice about job hunting locally would help.

Thanks so much. I’m looking forward to getting more connected in the community. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, or share my profile with anyone that you think maybe interested. Thanks again, and nice to meet you all!

1r9evt2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r9evt2,Day 15 & 16 Post-Op Update,"I think we’ve reached the point where daily updates might be excessive. Without surgical drains, Carnival traffic, and elevator stares, my life simply cannot maintain that level of entertainment. So we are moving to weekly episodes.

The last two days I’ve been resting and settling back into my home away from home… my van.

And no, I am not down by the river.

Although I have boondocked under bridges near rivers during my van-life era, so let’s not pretend I’m above that level of adventure.

I plan to return to work tomorrow night. For those who don’t know, I dispatch at an underground gold mine. It’s a sit-down job, which means I can sit there and get paid… or sit in my van and not get paid. Both provide excellent post-surgical comfort, but only one funds my coffee habit.

I am a little nervous about going back.

And if I’m being honest, it isn’t the work.

It’s the possibility of running into a certain coworker.

We dated briefly. I believed we were friends. That misunderstanding was clarified the night before I left for Panama when we ran into each other and the vibe was awkward enough to require emotional protective equipment.

In an effort to clear the air, I stopped by his place before leaving. That’s when he made it very clear that we are not friends.

This surprised me mostly because nothing had happened, and the last time we saw each other he was discussing giving me a key to his house.

So the emotional trajectory went from

“Here’s a spare key”

to

“stranger danger”

in record time.

I’m not eager to see him because I fear I may calmly and professionally explain that he should keep the same energy he had during our last conversation… and that I am, in fact, an excellent friend he will now never experience again.

Growth looks different at this age.

On a more productive note, I am working on a post about medical tourism and recovery because after this adventure I feel like I accidentally earned an associate’s degree in Post-Surgical Survival with a minor in Humidity Management.

I’m compiling a list of things that actually help during recovery… the stuff you truly need but nobody tells you beforehand.

If nothing else, my experience can serve as a public service announcement so others don’t have to learn about fajas, toilet logistics, airline pressure changes, and Carnival traffic the hard way.

Spoiler alert: healing is easier than finding a bathroom in Panama traffic.

Stay tuned. Wisdom is compiling.

Healing continues.

Mobility improving.

Boundaries upgraded.

I believe at this point Alien cannot exist without predator as Alien we know started off as a horror with the first movie, which really worked, but then moved on to action horror with the second movie which once again worked. 

However, once again in my opinion, after that Alien by itself just hasn't captured the essense of any of the former movies. Alien Earth attempted to bring a fresh concept, but it kind of just fell flat.

So, at this point, I really think Alien needs Predator to actually be successful. The horror aspect is long gone. Decent action, story, and depth need to replace it as they did with Predator Badlands.

I see a lot of folks in here asking about how to source green coffee directly from farms without going through the usual broker middlemen, so I wanted to drop a line and introduce myself.

A little background: I’m an LA-based camera operator and DP, but I’ve been living full-time in Costa Rica for the last 10 years. Over time, I've built strong local connections that allow me to bypass the traditional export routes and go straight to the source.

Case in point: As I’m typing this, I’m riding in the back of a van hauling a 3 quintales micro-lot of 2,000m Washed Geisha and some high-altitude SL28 down from the Los Santos region. We literally just pulled these off the depulper today after spending the night breaking bread at the farmer's family cabinas.

I’m hand-carrying a small lot of this back to Los Angeles on March 5th. While I’ll be sampling some out to a few local shops, my main goal right now is to broaden my connections. I would absolutely love to get an official score on this lot. If there are any certified Q-Graders or experienced home-roasters in the LA area who want to cup and evaluate this, I’d gladly trade some of this green Geisha or SL28 for your palate and time.

Also, since I live down here full-time, if anyone is actively looking for boots on the ground in Costa Rica to help navigate farm connections or the export side of things, I’m happy to chat.
