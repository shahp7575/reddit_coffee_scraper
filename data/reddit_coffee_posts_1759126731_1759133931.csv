The five-core-foundations are not just abstract categories, but the profound overarching structures that shape both the individual and collective realities. Within each foundational area, another five-fold flower unfolds, revealing the secondary layers, and then another. It is here, within the tertiary layers that we find the observable patterns of thought and behaviour within our everyday lived experiences - the way we react to stress or financial worries, our sense of community and belonging, our self-identity, boundaries, relationships, and perceived place within the natural world. Voids - places where fundamental needs have historically gone unmet - can be traced throughout these layers, and offer a profound level of insight into the individual mind and its unique processes. This ‘mapping’ not only allows us to put targeted protective measures in place, but provides a template to accurately predict future struggles.

If we hit at least 10 interested members, this group will officially kick off! 🚀

💡 Who This Group Is For:
If you’re shy, introverted, or just finding it harder to make new friends as life gets busier, this group is for you. The main goal is simple: to expand our circle of friends. As we grow older, our circles naturally shrink—but that doesn’t mean we can’t create new ones.

I’m looking to connect with people who want the same thing: a relaxed, no-pressure space to hang out, chill, and share good vibes together.

🎯 Primary Objectives:

Watch Parties 🎥 – UFC fights, World Cup 2026, and other exciting events (online or in-person).

Hangouts 🍹 – Quick chats, exploring hidden gems, bar hopping, discount buffet dinners, checkout the festive lights and artwork, watch F1/Fireworks, or just chilling at scenic spots.

Breaktime Buddies 🥡 – Lunch or coffee catch-ups during downtime.

Gaming Nights 🎮 – Casual multiplayer fun.

Mini Birthday Parties 🎂 – Small, lighthearted celebrations.

✅ Prerequisites:

Socially Initiative – You can start conversations, keep them going, and enjoy connecting with others.

Fun Planners – Share ideas for free/affordable activities and contribute to the group vibe.

Participation – Join discussions or check-ins at least once a week (no pressure, just effort!).

Respectful Vibes – This isn’t a dating group, but genuine friendship and camaraderie are encouraged.

If this sounds like your kind of crew, drop me a message and let’s build a chill little circle of activity buddies. 🥳",1,1759132660.0,ChillSG,0,1.0,False

1ntc4k0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1ntc4k0/dear/,Dear,"
Dear,

There aren’t many words that truly describe the way I feel about you. Half the time, I’m confused myself — and honestly, it scares the crap out of me. Before you showed up, I thought I had it all figured out. Maybe I’d been lying to myself this whole time, because you’ve unintentionally shown me how I really feel.

You came into my life in a pretty ordinary way, at least on the surface. The job was new, the people were new, and I was just trying to survive the chaos of finding my place amongst it all. But you… you were the special part of all of this. You made it easy. You were open, kind, available. I try to reciprocate it in full, but your capacity for kindness is a little wild. That big goofy smile paired with a hint of gloom, that walk I can’t stop staring at — instant connection. I ended up following you around like a lost puppy, so much so it became a joke: the “work couple.”

I was honestly worried about opening myself up to a friend like this again. The last one I placed my trust in did a lot of damage. But there was something about you that made that anxiety just disappear. You recognized my struggles without me saying a word and jumped into action. The generosity you showed without any expectation of reciprocation — except maybe the morning coffee run — was beyond measure. You didn’t even know me, yet you showed up for me like no one had before. That drew me to you — your ability to simply give — a quality I hadn’t seen in anyone but myself in a very long time.

Over the next year, we became inseparable. Countless hours spent working, on the phone, off work, gaming — just beside each other. All along I kept telling myself I had a partner and that feeling anything for you would be wrong, that it could never work anyway. Physically, we’re not built for each other. The attraction would never be there… or so I told myself. Yet we fit in every other way. So I pushed it down. But the curiosity and the want were always there — what you’d feel like, smell like up close; what it would be like to crawl into bed with you after a long day; the back of your neck as we lay there.

We joke about saving water, but I’m not really joking anymore. I imagine what it would feel like to let you melt into me when you needed someone for comfort, the way you already give me comfort without even knowing it. This year I noticed something new — you started fulfilling needs my partner hasn’t met for years. And you do it freely, just because you want to. Shit, there’s no pushing this down anymore.

You’re hesitant. It’s hard for you to share your feelings. But I love when you share your vulnerable sides — I feel honoured when you open up to me. That’s why I show you so much of myself: I want you to know you’re completely safe to do the same.

I can’t deny my attraction to you anymore. I wanted you closer, so I begged you to move in — without realizing I was sealing my own fate. I didn’t intend it, but after you moved in, I understood. I’d been lonely. My partner and our roommate weren’t like me — or nice to me, for that matter. Having you move in was a breath of fresh air. Someone finally on my team. Someone with similar views who gave me space to grow.

Unintentionally, it became a little clique, and I’ve been so okay with it. I love being available for you, and I love when you’re available for me. I want to be the person who brings you comfort and joy. In fact, I wish I brought you more. I lean on you more than you know, and I wish you’d lean on me a little harder.

You know how attractive you are — and it’s so attractive on you. When I call you cute, handsome or stud, I mean it from the bottom of my heart. Your clothes fit you so well. I love that you let me pick things out for you. I won’t lie — I pick clothes I want to see you in, and you look phenomenal in everything. You don’t know how much I want to take them off for you.

You tease me constantly, and I love it. I have to look away when you come out of the shower or I’ll stare too long and daydream while you call me a weirdo. The way you look in a towel makes me want to rip it off you and take you to your room and show you how much I want you. When you roll your sleeves up and reveal those beautifully defined arms you think aren’t muscled enough, I want to dive into them like an Olympic pool.

The way you walk around in your grey sweatpants, commando, is almost too much. I have to resist every urge not to press myself against you just to see your reaction. You have no idea how badly I’d love for you to come up behind me, hug me, scoop me up, lay me in your lap. Maybe if I could just hold you, even a little, I’d settle down. Maybe if we could be even slightly intimate. But I’m used to not getting what I want.

Your cheeky smiles, your “nothing phases me” attitude, your cute little bum, your gorgeous hair. Those eyes I get lost in constantly. God, I love your beard — I hate when you shave it. You teach me constantly when we game, and you’re always invested in helping me do better. And it’s hot when you get hot. I don’t like seeing you upset, but something about it turns me on and makes me want to help you relieve that stress.

What really makes me blush is how much you love teasing me about it. You know how much I like you, and something about you just loves making me squirm. Maybe that’s our way of edging into forbidden territory — territory I’d love to explore but am scared of because of the lasting impact. I crave your presence. I dream of you craving mine.

I think you’ve noticed it lately — the way I look at you is different than how I look at my partner. You have so much more of my affection, and love and I can’t even give it to you.

Your past partners have never treated you as you deserved. Yet you gave them so much of yourself, so much loyalty. I crave that for myself. I crave being able to give you the same respect. You deserve decency, love, admiration, grace, space, someone who will stand by you and help you up when you slip. I have all of that for you in droves.

I want to be the person who could right all those wrongs for you, who could show you that love — especially with someone so like you — can be freeing instead of confining. But I’m locked into the idea that having you in my life the way we are now is safer for both of us than risking something that could end with us never speaking again. And that would kill me.

Sometimes, and I hate admitting this, but I imagine it’s you when I’m with my partner, just so I can get off faster. It’s horrible, I know, but you’re so much more of what I want. You see me and know me so much more. It’s been undeniable for a while now.

I am head over heels for you. I need you. I want you as my person. And you’ll never want me the way I want you. I think I can live with it, because my love for you outweighs my need to have you. I tell you how much I like you, how much I’d love to be your person. I joke about how oversexed you’d be — but to you it’s all just friendly kindness and joking flirts. Maybe you do know, and maybe you’re scared because you’ve lived your entire life one way. Or maybe you don’t want to make a move because you’re the type of person who won’t invade someone’s relationship. But god, I’d love if you did.

A deep part of me wishes you wanted me the way I want you, so we could grow together into the people we’re meant to be. I’d never pressure you — you mean too much to me. But I can’t deny that I want us to be each other’s person… and yes, to fuck each other’s brains out on the regular.

The relationship and connection we’ve built over the last year is so valuable to me — something I’d do anything to protect. You know this, but not the intensity of it. Lately I’ve done nothing but wish you’d lean into me, let me be your pillar. I can handle it. I can handle so much. You have no idea what you do for me. And lately I’ve realized the chapter of “us” is one I want to last as long as possible in both our lives.

I need you. And though you’ve never said it, I have a feeling you need me too. You are my best friend, and I love you so much there isn’t a damn thing I wouldn’t do for you.

I know this is sappy and all over the place, but it’s a direct reflection of what you do to my brain. You make me want better for myself. You make me want to be better for you. You remind me that being gentle and kind in a harsh world is still needed.

You may have come into my life in the most ordinary way, but my life has been anything but ordinary since. I can’t thank you enough.

God, I’m so screwed.

With love,

He is an avoidant and always have been or he just didn’t like me enough from the start and I called it avoidance. I really don’t know anymore.

He wanted to meet me after the break up many times but I said I needed time. He wanted to get back together (his initiative - which I would love to), then changed his mind (all via texts). I went crazy mode. After all this back and forth I was the crazy ex texting and spamming and calling him with no avail.

So I met up with him yesterday. It was nice, at first I was scared to see him, but then it actually turned out nice. He was scared I would be crying dramatically, I was scared he would be an emotionless asshole, but we came up and had fun.

Since the break up I lost 5 kg (to my before relationship weight). I changed jobs to a highly paid one with less stress. I started to do a lot of sports, bought new clothes, did my hair nicely. All in all started to take care of myself much more.

He showed up casually, he didn’t really look well. He said he can’t sleep (I sleep like a princess now), but he does well in life and planned a lot of adventures for himself. 

He was eyeing me all meeting, my legs, my body, my face, constantly. At some point he wanted to show off how well is he doing now. From being the crazy ex who didn’t get a text back, I became the girl he now texts all the time. Immediately after he left the cafe I received first text, and few hours later he tried to take me for a walk. I offered to do it again (grab a coffee) in a week when he comes back from a trip - he agreed.

He even texted me how amazing I look now and how well I am doing. I WANT HIM BACK, but I want him to love me and care for me, I want him to be serious about me. I am a bit scared that he is just drown to how  hot and successful I am now. I also am scared he is simply trying to sleep with me. 

What are your thoughts? Should I cut him off now or give it a chance? The break up was so devastating for me..

We started texting, then calling, then meeting up for drinks. One night I realized I had fallen for him… hard. 
I tried to ignore it, I told myself I was happy with Ethan, that this was just a crush, but I kept thinking about this other guy all day, every day. I knew it wasn’t fair to Ethan, so I just started distancing myself from my boyfriend.

Eventually, I couldn’t stop thinking about Blake. I broke up with Ethan and started seeing him. Ethan begged me to stay, teared up, said he’d change, offered to move closer to my work.., etc. I didn’t seem to care, I felt so alive with this new guy.

Then I posted on Instagram about “new beginnings” with the hashtag #freshstart not tagging Blake, just… vibes, yknow? Some mutual friends saw it and messaged me like “Ethan is devastated, what are you doing??” I honestly didn't feel all too bad. Ethan is a great guy and will get over it and find new connections, plus being single for awhile is very good for self growth imo.

The next day, the five parents found themselves back in the café—different moods, same routine.

Ethan sat at the same table, trying to look like just another dad killing time before pick-up. Across from him, Reed stirred his tea with slow, deliberate movements. He was composed, but Ethan knew better. Reed was furious.

“You missed,” Reed said quietly.

Ethan took a sip of coffee, keeping his voice even. “No. Something went wrong.”

Reed’s grip on his cup tightened. Because now Keller was a liability. A man with too much to say.

The door opened, and Mason slouched in, his hoodie pulled up. He grabbed a seat without asking. Sarah entered next, eyes tracking the room like she was cataloging threats. Her gaze landed on Mason, and something in her expression shifted.

She had a feeling about him. A cop’s instinct.

Clara was the last to arrive. Impeccably dressed as always, but tense. Distracted. She had felt it that morning—the shift in her husband’s mood. Something was wrong in his world, and that meant it was wrong in hers, too.

Mason laughed awkwardly. “So… is this what we do now? Mysterious parents’ club?”

No one answered.

Sarah leaned toward Mason. “Rough night?”

Mason hesitated just a little too long. “What’s it to you?”

She shrugged. “Just get the feeling you know more than you let on.”

Mason’s fingers twitched against his coffee cup. A tell.

Across the table, Clara sighed, rubbing her temple. “My husband’s been… tense.”

Reed looked at her carefully. “Trouble at home?”

She forced a smile. “Nothing I can’t handle.”

Ethan watched it all unfold. Sarah circling Mason. Reed barely containing his rage. Clara masking unease.

And himself, stuck in the middle of it.

They left together, crossing the road to pick up their kids. Reed walked a little too close to Ethan.

# who inspired this house? Marie Antoinette or Catherine The Great?

We open literally off the rails with a big ass train derailment. Clara Barton says there are five victims but the way that train is like blown the fuck up makes me think our Railroad Daddy got lucky with a low death count. Shoulda been higher. So Daddy gives Ms. Barton more money and she is almost gagged but she thanks him and then she ask the Societal Alpinist if she's going to be at the next boring committee meeting and Daddy answers for her so we are all reminded the patriarchy had unchecked power in those days (I mean they unfortunately still do but we can at least scream them down now without being involuntarily committed to a mental ward for insubordination) Ms. Barton skips off with her big cheque and then SA asks what else they can do at this point, Mr. Smooth Voice tells them where the victims have been taken when a reporter asks for a photo op, so there are our antagonizing protagonists voguing Infront of a catastrophe.

[ONLY five?!](https://preview.redd.it/f2yhh63il1sf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c8a975767c0d88b242d9e5840b7155329d2a35a)

Back in New York on the cozy side of 61st, Agnes is reading the paper that the Russell's photo is featured in, she agrees with me that only 5 dead is a lucky escape for Daddy but she still blames him for it happening in the first place because she can't seem to be too generous about the Russells. Ada and Marian think she's being a bitch about it and call her on it, Ada then decides to change the subject by saying her cousin Margaret has written to her about the opera war. Not really concerned with the war bit, since that is next season's jam, but is cousin Margaret Aurora's mother? We know that Aurora is Agnes' niece by marriage since her husband was the brother of one of Aurora's parents, they never specify which parent though and we know that Aurora and Marian are still cousins because her other parent was a Livingston. This is my formal petition for HBO to release an official family tree so I don't have to waste my time speculating.

Railroad Daddy and Mr. Smooth Voice are back in New York now too and are in the offices of Russell Evil Incorporated where SV is giving RD a rundown of what the investigator's have confirmed about the incident. ""basically its was like old cheap ass parts were installed"" and Daddy is like ""the fuck do you mean?! I paid TOP DOLLAR for the BEST OF THE BEST WHO STOLE MY MONEY AND TRIED TO MAKE ME LOOK BAD?! I never look bad!! have you seen me shirtless?! I am a fucking GOD"" and SV is like ""yes I know, I think of it often. Anyway we are looking into it"" and RD is like ""people already blame me for that shady ass weakling shooting himself! I can't be blamed for the death of actual innocent people too!"" The stenographer comes in and is like ""hey Mr. Daddy, sir. I brought you the newspapers because they aren't saying terrible stuff!"" and RD is like ""fuck yeah, see donating to charity can save your ass!""

Mrs. Gambler asks her is she is going to run errands and Peggy tells her she's going with Little Miss Stubborn to a charity meeting but being the kind and considerate person she is Peggy offers to run errands for anyone who needs it and being the bigoted and bitchy person she is, the Bigoted Lady's Maid snaps that she doesn't need help. So Peggy leaves and Mrs. Gambler is like ""why can't you stop being a bitch when someone is trying to help you?"" and BLM is like ""because she's trying to set me up!! no one does nice things unless they are trying to get someone fired"" and the only reason BLM thinks that is because that's how she herself is.

On the way to the meeting Pretty Peggy asks Little Miss Stubborn why she's so glum and Marian says its because she's thinking of all the people who got dead on Railroad Daddy's railroad. Peggy is like ""it kind of makes you want to carpe diem since you'll never know what tomorrow will bring"" and LMS is like ""but what if you don't know which moment is the right one to seize?""  and PP is like ""I'm guessing you're talking about the Unstable Shyster that everyone keeps warning you off of...I think he's nice and I wouldn't throw him out of bed if we were married but remember he tried to get in your bed *before* you were married...so like is this the one?"" Right as they arrive at Girl Cousin's ridiculously grand house, a carriage pulls up and out pops Ms. Barton who is very excited to see Peggy because she wrote an amazing article in *The Globe* about the Red Cross and she asks her to be in the meeting and not off standing in the back like some member of staff (she still has to sit in the back like she's on a train though, Rosa Parks hadn't even been born yet) They head in and are greeted by the hostess and as much as I like Aurora I have to call her out for her visible discomfort at letting a Black woman through the front door of her home here.

Back on 61st Spinster Sister is doing one of the big important things spinsters do...reading quietly by herself. Mrs. Gambler tiptoes into the room with a dollar to give her, since she's paying back her gambling debt $1 at a time. Ada is trying not to be awkward but mentions how it must be difficult for Mrs. G to have to do this...thus making it awkward. Mr. Bannister is lurking in the shadows so now he knows Mrs. G owes Spinster Sister money.

[you're not fooling anyone, we see you back there! where is Pumpkin's snitch ass when you need him? \(no seriously, where is Pumpkin?!\)](https://preview.redd.it/911waiqdn1sf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=461e4ae1870c786596f5b955af3821f4de3b34b4)

Back to the meeting, Girl Cousin is telling the committee that she asked the Societal Alpinist to join them and Mrs. Stinkface decides to stink up the whole room and cause a scene because of course she does. Ms. Barton is like ""girl, get a grip. we are here to be charitable"" and Stinkface is like ""yeah but these kinds of charities are only patronized by fine well brought up ladies, not classless upstarts!"" and at that moment the Societal Alpinist enters the room and is like ""who, me?!"" so Girl Cousin is like ""vote time! who wants to give Mrs. Russell a seat at the table"" and in a room of about 12 women, only three of them (Marian, Aurora, and Clara Barton) raise their hand. So Ms. Barton stands up and is like ""this woman has donated more money than everyone in this room five times over"" so the rest of the bitches except for Stinkface raise their hand. Stinkface stands up and continues to embarrass herself ""so since my husband was selfish, killed himself, and left me in financial position so precarious I had to sell my house, I no longer get to be top dawg of charitable Manhattan??"" and Ms. Barton is like ""this isn't about you? it's about raising money. can we get back on track and focus on that mission??"" and Stinkface makes one last signature sour puss face and leaves the room being sure to emphasize her tantrum by scoffing at Pretty Peggy on her way out. So now that the witch is dead so to speak, Ms. Barton calls for a coffee break and goes back to Pretty Peggy to fangirl some more about her being at the meeting, she thanks Aurora for allowing it and Aurora's good manners is only slightly edging out her lowkey racism in this scene too >!I know Aurora grows in to a lovely person who counts Peggy as a near equal by S3, its still so hard to see such a sweet person acting like this!< So then Ms. Barton asks Little Miss Stubborn ""hey did you get that money from Mrs. Chamberlain yet?"" and LMS is like ""oh not yet, we have a play date on Thursday though"" and Aurora is like ""oh god, didn't Mrs. Russell donate enough that we don't need to dip in to the insane hat fund?"" and Ms. Barton is like ""hello? this is a charity? since when there a thing as too much money for charity?!""

[and she was never seen again.](https://i.redd.it/nzxekfznn1sf1.gif)

Pretty Peggy and Little Miss Stubborn are leaving the meeting and decide to share a cab even though they are going to different locations. LMS hails a cab and he stops but says Pretty Peggy has too much melanin to hitch a ride from him and LMS thinks this is a perfect opportunity to prove how stubborn she can be, and the cab driver proves to her how sometimes her stubbornness just leads to her looking like an idiot and he dusts her right there on the sidewalk. She turns to Peggy so they can be outraged together but Peggy only seems annoyed that Marian persisted and naively argued with the driver. Peggy smartly hails the cab for herself so they can go about their day.

[Peggy should charge Agnes more money since she's also out here educating Marian at every turn.](https://i.redd.it/v5fg8fmho1sf1.gif)

Inside Aurora is still trying to make excuses for Mrs. Stinkface and Bertha is being very generous about, but mostly because she knows she won and has traversed another obstacle in her ascent but then she starts treating the train crash like its a new obstacle in her quest and Aurora is so aghast by the suggestion of it she moves the conversation on and says ""Mr. McAllister said that he really wants to see the inside of your house but I guess he needs me to tell you that since y'all still aren't on the same level"" and the Societal Alpinist is like ""whaaat?! WARD MCALLISTER WANTS TO COME TO MY CRIB?!"" and they keep talking about it but I am honestly too distracted by Aurora's necklace to keep up with the conversation. She basically just tells Bertha invite the same people from the first luncheon, make sure that it's served the English way and not to fuck up.

Back to the old timey printing press but this time Mr. T Thomas Fortune and Pretty Peggy aren't running it, they are sitting and having a chat and he's like ""yo girl! you have made this paper fly off the newsstands and now more people want it delivered directly!!!"" and she's like trying to act modest and says ""aww how do you even know I had anything to with it?!"" and he's like ""because everyone won't stop talking about Clara Barton! how did you even get that interview?!"" and she's like ""oh I know this stubborn and naive girl who I have inexplicably become ride or die for and she got me the interview"" and he's like ""well keep riding for that girl to get more scoops like this!""

[aww a friend!](https://i.redd.it/1crzm6zzs1sf1.gif)

At Russell Manor, the Societal Alpinist is telling the senior staff about the demands for her McAllister luncheon, and Frenchie is like ""We all know I will explode his tastebuds with my authentic French cuisine, why does it matter how the table is set?"" and SA is like ""it matters and I need everything to be perfect"" and the Butler is like ""didn't we win the revolutionary war so we didn't have to follow the fucking monarchy and their customs"" and she ignores him and says ""French main course, English side dishes, English service...the only thing that can be American about this luncheon is the hostess"" and the staff all get concerned looks on their faces so she dismisses them and Housekeeper follows her into the hall and is like ""excuse me boss lady ma'am, can I mention something"" and the SA is like ""if it's beneficial to me, of course"" and Housekeeper is like ""you know the old crones across the street have an English butler and they do it in the ways of the Old World in that house"" and SA is like ""of fucking course they do, but how does that help me?"" and Housekeeper is like ""maybe we can ask their butler for some tips, of course if our butler is ok with it"" and SA is like ""tell him, don't ask him because its an order""

To Brooklyn and Mama Scott is playing the piano, Peggy enters the house and just listens to her playing and I know I couldn't be the only one watching this screaming at the tv ""AND NOW SING!!!"" not giving Ms. Audra a chance to sing seems criminal to me, but alas they don't sing but we find out that Mama Scott is a piano teacher in her spare time. Mama starts fangirling over her article but Peggy asks if Papa Scott feels the same and he of course has not shown any outward support for it. Peggy says she can't stay long but seeing that this was pre-Brooklyn Bridge, that's a long ferry ride to stay for a few minutes but then she gets down to the nitty-gritty of the reason she showed up ""I told that naive but stubborn and nosy white girl to stay out of my business but I now realize she is too stubborn to honor that so I am asking you not to talk to her about our lives again."" and she leaves.

[let them sing! let them sing!! LET THEM SING!!!](https://i.redd.it/zet9wet9t1sf1.gif)

Back at Russell Manor, Daddy is home and the Societal Alpinist tells him she has done as he wished and ascended to the board of the Red Cross. He tells her the troubling news that someone installed poorly made parts in the train and pocketed the difference, making his company complicit in murder and her response is ""We need to do damage control! This will ruin everything I am working for"" and he's shook because she's talking about social climbing when he could go to fucking prison so he snaps at her for being selfish and then apologizes even though he was 300% within his right to do so. She changes the subject by telling him she opened their daughter's mail and he's like ""you still fucking do that?!"" and she's like ""yes, I told you I am going to control every aspect of this girls life!"" so he snatches the letter so he can give it to his baby and she's like ""don't be a little bitch George!!!"" and he's like ""takes one to know one"" and storms out.

[Man, don't apologize!!! I spend a lot of time defending your wife but you were right on this one.](https://i.redd.it/ko2es5iht1sf1.gif)

My Girlie Gladys is reading the letter her mother read first and is like ""but he was so hot!!! why is he being rejected?!"" and Daddy is like ""your mother...not me...your mother thinks yous a baby and you shouldn't settle down yet"" and she's like ""yeah well then say we have to wait before we can get married, but you told him that he can never see me again or you'll ruin his life!!"" and RD is like ""why do you think I said that and not your mother because it was totally your fucking mother's idea"" and she's like ""BECAUSE IT SAYS SO IN THIS FUCKING LETTER AND YOU WERE THE ONE I SAW SPEAKING TO HIM RIGHT BEFORE HE RAN AWAY FROM THIS HOUSE CRYING, FATHER""  and he's like ""only because your mom made me"" and she's like ""and you're such a henpecked bitch that you can't say no?! HE WAS PERFECT FOR ME"" and he's like ""your mother wants more than that for you"" and she's like ""but I am boring and uninteresting and unimportant and my life should reflect that"" and he's like ""one thing I can agree with your mother on is that you are none of those things, and you deserve the whole world""

[untagged spoiler: were all the people saying \\""I can't believe George!\\"" in S3 sleeping during this scene?](https://i.redd.it/j98hep9aw1sf1.gif)

Its the next day and across the street the Brook women are having their daily chat, Agnes is clutching her pearls because Marian just told her that she was going to have lunch at Russell Manor in a few days  and she's like ""I can't believe McAllister would stoop so low as to go into that cockroach den, but mark my words THE Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor would NEVER"" and then Ada is like ""oh so is that lawyer you like going to be there?"" and Little Miss Stubborn is like ""yes, he was invited"" and Agnes sits back and is like ""of fucking course he is"" and LMS is like ""he's like the perfect gentleman! why can't you just accept him as a suitor for me?"" and Agnes is like ""I know men like him and I promise you, he might think you're sweet but at the end of the day your pockets are too empty for him and he will leave you in the dust! Mark my words"" and LMS storms off because she thinks her aunt is stuck up, prejudiced, and wrong.

[a baddie AND an oracle.](https://i.redd.it/eg0ieykkw1sf1.gif)

Downstairs the backdoor rings and Little Red answers since she's had nothing to do this episode and it's a footman from across the street sending Bannister the SOS message about how to be English.

Upstairs at Russell Manor and Curls says he got an invitation from Mamie Fish that was also extended to My Girlie, and the Societal Alpinist is like ""you can go, your sister is my prisoner and must stay here"" and both kids whine and Daddy is like ""let her go!"" and Curls is like ""besides Caroline Astor, Jr will be there"" and SA raises her eyebrows and is like ""word? are you like for sure, for sure that Carrie Astor will be there?"" and he's like ""100% sure"" so the SA happily agrees to let My Girlie attend this party.

Downstairs, Bannister has come by to see what the fuss is about. So he asks what food they will be serving and Church is like ""what does that matter?"" and Bannister is like ""because every dish has a distinct an correct way to be served, its not all the same routine slop that you Americans are so fond of"" and Frenchie is like ""the food will be French with English sides"" and Bannister is like ""well you tell me the French part and I will tell you the English things that would go well"" and he leaves because he doesn't have time for this shit.

To this party that Mrs. Fish invited the Russell siblings to and it's weird white people shit (no offence but I mean, come on!!!), there are all these creepy porcelain dolls and some poor bastard is pouring these tiny little cups of punch for the dolls? Truly bizarre stuff is happening. So the siblings come in and Mrs. Fish explains to them what the party for her daughter (who seems like she's 12 or 13, so too old for this shit and definitely too old for her mother to talk to her in that insane baby voice) is about and Curls is seriously weirded out by the whole thing...and boy, same. When Mrs. Fish leaves he turns to see Caroline Astor, Jr. sitting by herself so he goes to say hi but as he gets closer he sees she's crying. He offers to back off and she's like ""oh is this the youngest Russell?!"" so Curls introduces them and then immediately is like ""yo! I see dudes over there!!! I am going to talk to them instead, y'all stay here and talk about women's troubles"" so he runs off and My Girlie Gladys is like ""are you sure you want to hang out? I can like leave you alone"" and Carrie is like ""oh its ok, I am almost done crying. i am just having a moment because my mom hates my boyfriend"" and My Girlie is like ""ok so we are basically twins and now we will be best friends"" and they shake hands to solidify their friendship.

[is that a glove that the doll removed and put on the tray? what on earth is this?! ](https://preview.redd.it/wn10bz9dx1sf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7a7b997b76202b02f2bcff39fb52f160757ab78)

Bannister is already back at Russell Manor and Church is showing him how he plans to set the table. Bannister is tearing him down like it's the turn of the 21th century and we are on one of those makeover shows where they bullied people with impunity. The Societal Alpinist is listening by the door and she's hearing the 900 ways her American butler will fuck up her life, so she's like ""Hello Mr. Bannister, I will flatter you by using the Mr. prefix because this is serious. I will pay you $100 to like just be here and run the luncheon for me"" and if you're interested the inflation calculator says that is $3,176.24 in modern monies, so I'd probably be tripping over myself to accept too. Church is big pissed because he's getting passed over and that's probably more than he makes in a month. So Bannister literally skips out of the house and across the street back to the cozy side of 61st and devises a plan to get away for the afternoon. First he approaches Jack about serving luncheon that day and Jack is gagged which leads me to believe that Bannister never gets a day off? If no one else in the house has done this before, because Jack clearly hasn't and I can't imagine Agnes would be cool with a maid serving a meal because as much as she's my spirit animal and I love her, she's a stickler for convention. Anyway Jack is like ""you gotta tell the ladies because I am terrified of them""

[ready to risk it ALL.](https://i.redd.it/wcy2efh4y1sf1.gif)

Marian and Peggy are leaving the Lenox Library and Marian is going to meet up with Mrs. Chamberlain, Peggy asks her what excuse she'll give her aunts and of course she's like ""I'll tell them we went to the library, they don't need to know more than that"" and Peggy looks at her like *damn, you are so comfortable just lying* just in that moment they run in to Curls who is coming out of a building marked **Offices of two unknown dudes and Stanford White, Architects** Marian introduces Peggy to Larry and then gets all nosy as she is want to do, Peggy knows she doesn't want any part in the nosiness so she turns to look at what the street vendor is selling and Curls tells Little Miss Stubborn that he wants to be an architect, so LMS is like ""but don't you work in nepotism?"" and Curls is like ""yeah but I don't want that life, I am trying to kick over the traces, and being an architect will make me like the one thing my father doesn't own a business in"" So he scurries away and Peggy looks at her friend is like ""girl, that one seems nice"" in a tone that makes me wish she flat out said ""much nicer than the other guy!""

At Insane Hat Lady's museum house, Little Miss Stubborn is having tea with Manhattan's most notorious widow...she's in her own home so unfortunately there is no insane hat to be seen. So Insane Hat Lady is like ""they sent you here for my money?"" and Little Miss Stubborn is like ""oh well the big spenders, like Mrs. Russell, get seats on the board so maybe..."" and IHL is like ""oh you sweet naive girl, ain't no way they would let me on the board with my past"" and LMS is like ""so its like true? the things they say about you?"" and IHL is like ""100% I went the mistress to wife route and while being a rule breaker can be a bummer at times I don't regret it for a second because that man loved me and look around!""  and LMS is like ""oh I want to be a rule breaker too! I am considering throwing my whole life away on a man as we speak"" and IHL is like ""tell me more about this man"" and LMS is like ""Well he's hot, and a good lawyer I think? and people like him so he's all about town without my help, and he knows exactly how broke I am because of how good a lawyer he is so if he wants me it must be like legit you know?"" and IHL is like ""I feel like there is a but"" and LMS is like ""but my aunt hates him, she thinks he's a shyster and unstable"" and Insane Hat Lady widens her eyes so bit that her micro bangs jump a little bit and she's like ""oooh but you are so naive and your aunt may be a castigator, but she's usually right"" and LMS is like ""how can she be right when she doesn't even know him! I don't even know him!"" so IHL is like ""ok well then, since you are the only nice person in this town I will do you a good turn and let you use my house as a rendezvous point so you can get to know him""

[the knowledge isn't stored in the hat you guys, this one is just smart. ](https://preview.redd.it/unaiwihnz1sf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6dc320d9e3be584bc72cb647c9e1fee1e6c074b)

Back to Russell Manor and we are in My Girlie Gladys' room, she really does still have her dolls in her room and they are the same creepy kind of dolls from Mrs. Fish's party so I am not sure why she seemed so awkward at this party. She's laughing and in a rare good mood and we pan out to see that Caroline Schermerhorn Astor Jr. has kept her promise of paying her a visit, so of course her mother bursts through the door because she wants to be as close to Caroline Sr. as possible and this is as good as it will get for a while. Carrie asks Bertha if Gladys could come over for a luncheon next week at her mothers house and if you slow the tape down slow enough you can probably see the moment when our antagonistic protagonist, the Societal Alpinist, pees herself a little bit. ""oh, but she hasn't made her debut"" and Carrie is like ""you should get on that, she's rotting on the shelf basically, besides this house is built for this exact purpose isn't it? Anyway my debut was so much fun we did a quadrille and it was a riot!"" and SA looks a little confused because I don't think she fully understands what a quadrille actually is so Carrie explains further ""you know, we get groups of guys and girls and costumes and put on a little production for everyone to open the ball!"" and SA is like ""well I'll leave you girls to plan that and I will get this ball on the books"" and when she leaves My Girlie Gladys is like ""OH MY FUCKING GOD FINALLY!!!!!""

Across the street Bannister is lying through his teeth to get out of his job for one afternoon so he can make his annual salary in a day, but Agnes is confused because she's like ""I hired you because I didn't want to be inconvenienced by such things as 'familial obligation'!!!!!"" Ada comes in and is like ""why are you freaking out?"" and Agnes is like ""because Bannister is a trader!!"" and they go to get changed for dinner. After getting changed Ada warns Marian not to bring up tomorrow's luncheon because Agnes is already annoyed by it and Agnes notices that Bigoted Lady's Maid seems troubled so she asks her what's up and BLM is all like ""oh you know, your secretary is writing articles for the newspaper and people are talking about it...I think it will be bad for this house"" and Agnes is like ""if you don't shut your racist mouth up and be charitable to who is more precious to me than my own son, you'll be out on your ass""

[I wish I had half the foresight that Agnes seems to have.](https://i.redd.it/9r0vy45vz1sf1.gif)

Very brief carriage ride with Railroad Daddy and Mr. Smooth Voice to say that the investigation agency who is named after Weezer's best album (ok I like the blue album best but Pinkerton is good too) hasn't reported their findings yet, but since they are the best money can buy they will very soon.

It's Friday the 18th and some sleuthing on Google tells me that if Fellowes looked at a calendar when he wrote this episode, we are currently in August of 1882. Bannister is sneaking across the street to secure his bag and he's got the Russell footman lined up like he's a drill sergeant, to add insult to injury he makes Church get in line with them...Church doesn't like this and tells Frenchie he's going on an errand. Across the street Jack is having a little bit of a nutty and the ladies are not helping much. Bigoted Lady's Maid is of course antagonizing him, Little Red is trying to gas him up because while she doesn't want to hold his hand she still seems to care a great deal about his successes, and Mrs. Gambler is being like a well adjusted mom that doesn't want to hold your hand through it but also doesn't want to see you fall flat on your face. The way everyone is acting makes it even clearer that Bannister has never taken a meal off for the entirety of his employment in this house so can he drop his secrets because he must never get sick?

Marian arrives at Russell Manor and she sees Bannister in the dining room and she's like ""girl WHAT?"" and he's like ""shhhhhh!"" and she's like ""don't worry, I am a habitual liar where it concerns my aunt so I got you"" Outside we see McAllister pull up in his carriage and he can smell the money from the sidewalk so he's skipping up those steps to get inside, when Bannister greets him he's like ""oh goodie goodie and ENGLISHMAN!!!"" and you see Church lurking around the corner with steam coming from his head. So Bannister shows him into the drawing room and of course McAllister is the last to arrive (wouldn't The Fanes also know Bannister and also be curious as to why their aunt's butler is across the street? this whole plot line seems so odd) anyway, McAllister is like ""oh shit you fancy fancy, did you have this home imported from Tsarskoye Selo?"" and here is another moment where we are clued into the fact that while she might be rich and hardworking, the Societal Alpinist isn't well educated, well read, or well travelled so she has no idea that Tsarskoye Selo was the village where the Russian imperial family lived and the location of the Alexander Palace. But Aurora comes in with the save and is like ""Yeah Mrs. Russell and Catherine the Great would have been such besties!"" and McAllister is like ""interesting because I think Mrs. Astor is a modern day Catherine the Great!"" Across the room huddled in a corner Little Miss Stubborn is trying to have a stolen moment with her Unstable Shyster. She once again asks him how his New York life is going and he once again responds by telling her he's going to a ball thrown by a different one of New York's preeminent families but he wants to spend some time with her because she's his number one girl or some shit.

They go in to lunch there is so much glittering shit on that tablescape I don't know where the food will fit. I see Bannister let them keep the tacky colored champagne flutes and McAllister is like ""OUT OF SEASON FLOWERS!!! HOW FANCY AND EXPENSIVE"" and I am thinking, why not just get someone to make paper flowers out of dollars and all the guests can take them home if we are going to just throw money around? But thats not the end of her tossing money left and right because they go to grab their napkins and find they are actually the wrapping for a gift. The ladies got fans and the men got little boxes...are they cigarette holders? I am too poor to know what its for but they are made from gold and incrusted with jewels and the one we see McAllister unwrap has a fucking monogram on it and he's like ""you have gone above and BEYOND girl!"" and Railroad Daddy is like ""no really, you have"" but in an impressed way and not in the same annoyed or flabbergasted way my husband says it when I have wasted his money to no real purpose.

[can anyone tell me what the fuck it is?](https://preview.redd.it/bzszuv2e42sf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e2030dc797a9eff9205f1a7e60701eaf92b9dbd)

Across the street Jack is trying but his nerves are really making a mess of luncheon, the ladies aren't helping either with all their yapping, he's skipped feeding one of them (there are only two people to feed!) and he's spilled wine on the tablecloth, when Little Red pokes her head in the door with a note she found on the doorstep, so he takes it to Agnes and she instantly pops up out of her seat and heads for the door, no hat, no coat, no escort...strides right across 61st and rings the bell of Russell Manor and when she walks into the hall Church is so giddy you'd expect him to start tap dancing. Once she gets over the shock of how ridiculously grand the house is she bursts right into the dining room about to have it out with her butler when her niece (the meek one, not the habitual liar) is like ""hi auntie!! I didn't know you were coming to this!"" and then her other niece puts her habitual lying talents to good use and is like ""oh she forgot that clock in our drawing room is broken and thought she was just going to say hi to us before lunch started, right?"" and Agnes is like ""oh yeah, my bad. Please continue your luncheon, I must be late for mine"" and on the way out she stabs Bannister with her eyes and he's afraid for his life.



[I came in like a wrecking ball!!!!!!](https://i.redd.it/38052aop52sf1.gif)

In the park the Troublemaker and Agnes' Feckless Son are having their ""How to dupe the Russells into letting you marry Gladys"" meeting. She tells him that he's wasting his time trying to convince the Societal Alpinist that he's the one because she's smart and would never let him anywhere near My Girlie, but that Railroad Daddy could be convinced if Gladys seems like she'll be happy and in love. They walk across the avenue back to 61st and right as they are parting, the Bigoted Lady's Maid who is leaving the house to run errands sees the Troublemaker stroke the arm of her mistress' son so she turns around and goes back in the house because she wants to snitch like a bitch.

[Why you got to always be so touchy feely, Troublemaker?!](https://i.redd.it/6xbdek5u52sf1.gif)

Its later that night and everyone is dealing with the aftermath of Agnes embarrassing herself. In the servant quarters, Marian is giving Peggy a rundown of how the afternoon went and the take away is that they feel bad for Agnes but Peggy encourages Marian to be supportive to her aunt in the changing world. Downstairs Bannister is talking to the Gambler and Jack (who was praised for his work by Ada and Agnes even though he felt he was unworthy of praise) and he vows to find out who snitched him out in that letter. And in her room Agnes is reeling from her embarrassing moment, the same song that played when Patrick Morris shot himself is playing which is funny because this isn't nearly as dramatic (the song is actually named for this scene though) so she's telling BLM how foolish she felt and BLM is like ""oh you are getting betrayed left and right, its got to suck...especially since one of them is your own son"" and Agnes is like ""if you don't open your mouth right now!!!"" and so BLM whispers into her ear and Agnes' eyes get so wide that you think her head is going to explode and that's why the dramatic song is playing.

[Agnes and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.](https://preview.redd.it/gzy6wnrf52sf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d2fd8baeea77a8aba4d6a67f7cf2a86b73d2301)

But no, that's not the reason. Across the street Daddy got another one of those orange Western Union sheets and he's just staring at it unmoving. His wife comes in and she's vomiting the expensive out of season lilacs and hyacinths with joy and singing about how successful her luncheon was once again missing the fact that her husband is in turmoil. She keeps obliviously talking to him about her trivial societal gains and he's still staring at the paper and not moving, when she finally sees the bright fucking orange paper on top of all the dark mahogany or whatever the fuck his study is made of and ask what it is.

But [**what is a POS system**](https://www.glorywebs.com/blog/what-is-a-pos-system?utm_source=gp&utm_medium=backlink&utm_campaign=reddit), and why is it essential for businesses in 2025? Simply put, a POS (Point of Sale) system is a combination of hardware and software that enables businesses to process sales, manage inventory, track customer data, and generate reports.

With evolving technology, modern POS systems are no longer limited to simple transactions—they now incorporate advanced analytics, mobile integrations, and cloud-based capabilities to streamline operations. Understanding the top features to look for ensures your business stays competitive and ready for the digital era.

# Key Features of a POS System in 2025

# 1. Cloud-Based Functionality

A cloud-based POS system allows real-time data access from anywhere, making inventory management, sales tracking, and reporting seamless. Businesses can synchronize multiple locations, monitor trends, and make quick decisions without relying on local servers.

**Example:** A retail chain can update product prices across all stores instantly and analyze sales data remotely, boosting operational efficiency.

# 2. Mobile and Contactless Payments

In 2025, customers expect convenience. A modern POS system should support mobile payments, NFC technology, and digital wallets. Contactless payment options not only enhance customer experience but also improve transaction speed and reduce physical contact.

**Example:** Restaurants using mobile-enabled POS devices can accept Apple Pay, Google Wallet, and tap-to-pay cards, reducing checkout time and enhancing customer satisfaction.

# 3. Advanced Inventory Management

Inventory management is a cornerstone of modern POS systems. Features like automated stock updates, low-stock alerts, and predictive analytics help businesses maintain optimal inventory levels and reduce losses.

**Example:** A fashion retailer can automatically reorder popular items when stock is low, minimizing missed sales opportunities.

# 4. Integrated Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

Modern POS systems offer built-in CRM tools to track customer preferences, purchase history, and loyalty programs. This integration helps businesses deliver personalized experiences, promotions, and loyalty rewards.

**Example:** A coffee shop can send targeted offers to regular customers based on their favorite orders, increasing repeat business and customer retention.

# 5. Analytics and Reporting

Advanced reporting features allow businesses to monitor sales trends, employee performance, and customer behavior. Data-driven insights help optimize operations, plan marketing strategies, and improve overall profitability.

**Example:** A retail store can generate daily, weekly, or monthly sales reports to identify top-selling products and adjust marketing strategies accordingly.

# Leveraging Custom Travel Software Development in Your POS System

For travel businesses, integrating a POS System with [Custom Travel Software Development](https://www.glorywebs.com/travel-software-development-company.html?utm_source=qa&utm_medium=backlink&utm_campaign=reddit) can create a seamless experience for both staff and customers. Customized travel POS solutions allow agencies, tour operators, and transportation services to manage bookings, process payments, track customer preferences, and generate reports—all from a single platform.

**Example:** A travel agency can automate ticketing, manage multiple trips, and analyze sales performance using a POS system tailored through custom travel software development. This not only enhances efficiency but also provides actionable business insights.

# Conclusion: Choosing the Right POS System

Selecting the right POS System in 2025 requires a focus on flexibility, automation, and analytics. By prioritizing cloud functionality, mobile payments, inventory management, CRM integration, and advanced reporting, businesses can streamline operations, enhance customer experiences, and boost profitability.

If you are still wondering what is a POS system suitable for your business, consider partnering with experts who can implement a tailored solution that meets your specific needs.

My husband Madsen's voice voice filtered through the door, a shard straight to my heart.

""Twenty years next months with Emily. A long time."" He supplied, his tone deadpan as though he were reading an instruction manual rather than tearing his wife's heart apart.

""A tip. Don't let yourself be locked down with just one person.""

My chest ached with the breath I was holding, but it released in a hiss. Rage coiled through me, and I slammed the door open. ""Liar!""

He jolted up from the sofa, eyes wide.

""No, Em—wait, that’s not what it sounded like!"" His voice cracked, raw with fear. ""I never crossed the line with Sarah, never!""

""You ever been tempted to sleep with her?"" I locked eyes with him—the man I’d loved for decades.

He hesitated.

In that pause, all the read but unanswered texts, all the nights with the empty bed and even emptier promises came flooding back—Now I knew where he’d been.

I wiped the tears from my cheeks, and swallowed down my sobs.

""You make me sick.""

——

Emily Flowers braced one hand against the wall, tried to catch her breath, and failed.

Her lungs refused to drag in air because her heart was no longer beating.

Because it had just shattered into a million jagged pieces, covered in blood and bits of shredded, gory flesh.

She should have kept walking. She should have never even come to the clubhouse in the first place. But she was a good wife, a g0dd@mn wifey rock star, and she wanted to make sure her husband, the love of her life, had his favorite pair of jeans—she'd even repaired the hole in the waistband for him. All she planned to do was leave them in his bedroom upstairs, pop her head into his office to tell them they were there...maybe get one of those beautiful crooked smiles from him for the first time in too long, a smile that she was so freaking needy for. That same smile that had won her adolescent heart that summer day long ago. That same smile that turned her inside out on their wedding day, as she stood before him, sliding a ring on his finger, and pledging her life to him.

It was that ring, that pledge that had brought her to the clubhouse, her loyalty despite the chilly, steel walls thickening between them. She missed him, so freaking much, so she told herself that even a glimpse of him, the rumbling sound of his voice, the whiff of his familiar leather and bourbon scent would be enough to hold her over until they could figure things out.

And they would figure things out, because they were end game, they were forever. They were one and only.

But she shouldn't have bothered.

She shouldn't have given in to the desperate urge to see her husband, a man she hadn't set eyes on in over a week. A man who had clothes in her closet, coffee mugs in her cupboards, and a cold, empty spot on the other side of her bed, but hadn't set foot in their home of fifteen years in over seven days.

She should have known something was wrong; he never went that long without at least coming to grab a change of clothes. When they'd first married, for those first few months before he'd enlisted and shipped off to Fort Drum, he'd been a homebody, only ever leaving their tiny single-wide trailer to go to work at the grocery store, stocking the shelves. After work, he'd come home, stay home, and they'd spend all their time together. They had no money for fun and extras, so they made do with cable they stole from the next-door neighbors, cheap meals, a comfortable bed, and the person they loved. But now...he was an MC president and former American warrior, so she was used to long absences in the name of duty.

But lately....

Her ears, the tips burning, locked in on a voice that wasn't the smoky rumble of her husband's.

""Frost...you know I'm here for you....""

It wasn't ""duty"" her husband, the love of her life, was chatting with behind a closed door in his office in the middle of the day. A sliver of a crack between the door and the frame allowed the voices to carry into the suddenly suffocating emptiness of the corridor.

Thankfully, the clubhouse was empty; the brothers and who-res all busy doing whatever the he1l they did during the day.

At least they aren't here to see me fall apart...their ""queen"".

What a freaking joke.

I should have kept walking.... Her breath caught as her husband's voice caught her ear.

""I know you are, sugar, and I can't tell you how grateful I am,"" Frost replied in a tone, soft and warm, that Emily had only ever heard him use with her and their children. His family. Their family. His and hers. A family they'd built from nothing but adolescent hopes and dreams.

And sugar? When did he start calling other women pet names?

Something inside of her twisted painfully, making her bite back a groan.

He called their daughter, Sorsha, ""Princess"", and he called—used to call Emily, his wife, his ""Bloom."" Even as a kid, she'd been fascinated by flowers and plants, so much so that her dream had always been to ""do something"" with flowers. And he always said he loved that about her, that she loved pretty, living things, and that she was so good at growing things that made people smile. She always preened when she'd said things like that, his words filling her up, like she'd inhaled a lungful of the most beautiful fragrance, then held it there to memorize every separate scent.

A scent that meant everything to her.

But now...the scent on that bloom no longer pleased...it stank like it had been cut from the bush and left to rot in the dirt.

Sugar...he'd never called any other woman anything other than their name.

That wasn't true now.

Her heart jerked in her chest, pushing jolts of energy into her limbs, urging her to keep moving, to walk away, to escape so she wouldn't have to hear the other half of her soul give a piece of himself to another woman.

I should have kept walking.... Because then she would be blissfully ignorant. That was better than the pain, right? Than the realization that what she'd feared the most in the whole world was playing out just on the other side of an office door.

But she hadn't kept walking, didn't pas-s by his office to drop his jeans in his room as she'd planned when she'd first arrived; she stopped...because she'd heard her name...and the rest of what she heard turned her feet to stone.

""I know Emily hasn't been around in a while,"" a voice Emily was starting to really hate remarked, the tone slimy with false empathy.

She easily recognized her husband's grunt, which was an answer all on its own.

The other woman gave out a heavy sigh, like she had anything heavy other than those ti ts which were as fake as the diamond in the first engagement ring her husband gave her, back when all he could afford was the plastic ring he bought from the dispenser at Chuck E. Cheese for a quarter on his twenty-first birthday, and she was just shy of eighteen...and two months pregnant with their twins.

Their romance was somewhat controversial in that he was a legal adult when they'd first had se-x, but they'd been careful to follow Pennsylvania's Romeo & Juliet laws. People could curl their lips in disgust, but they weren't doing anything wrong. So, when he was drinking age, and she was still in high school, he put a ring on it.

But that ring from the cheap machine meant more to her than the authentic diamond ring he bought her five years later, after his first deployment.

Emily dropped her gaze to the ring, still encircling her finger, a finger wrapped in a Band-Aid because she'd been distracted and had gotten her finger caught in the wire she was using to create a funeral wreath.

""Are things okay between you two—I only ask because I worry about you."" The words sounded genuine, delivered with a soft cooing that made Em's teeth grind, but Emily knew the utterances of manipulation when she heard them. And Mads should, too.

Right?

""Everyone wants what you have, Frost...even me,"" that voice simpered, a pout obvious in her tone.

She wanted what Frost had, did she? Or did she simply want Frost?

Acrid saliva built in the back of Em's throat, but she swallowed it back.

Forcing the sudden buzzing from her ears, she held her breath once more to listen through the sliver in the doorway.

""You don't understand,"" the voice of her husband, Madsen Flowers, her heart and soul, said softly, gently, pleadingly, ""you are too young to be stuck—you have a full life ahead of you. You cannot let yourself be locked down with just one person.""

""Like you did?"" that freaking voice asked, a little too interested, though it was skillfully hidden behind empathetic cooing.

Like you did? Sarah, the slinky club b1tch, was asking Frost if he was stuck—as in...with his wife? What the he1l?

Em's chest ached with the breath she was holding, but it released in a hiss.

Please, please say ""no"" that you aren't talking about yourself—about us....

""Twenty years next month,"" Madsen supplied, his tone deadpan as though he were reading an instruction manual rather than tearing his wife's heart apart. ""Started dating at twenty, but...I'd known her for years before that. Best friends."" There was a speaking silence, one that whispered ""enduring"" and ""everlasting."" He sighed, the sound like a gunshot in an empty stadium. ""Long time.""

Yes, a long time—from the time she turned sixteen and he was twenty, but they waited to have se-x until she was seventeen, almost eighteen, because he wanted to make sure she was truly ready.

And she had been. They'd both been.

There was a shuffling, like feet moving across the industrial carpeting, and then the tell-tale sound of creaking leather as someone sat down.

The sliver in the door didn't allow for her to see inside, so she had no idea what was happening. Did she want to know what was happening? Were they sitting together on that old leather couch? Were they sitting close? Were their arms touching, their legs? Were they leaning into each other, staring into each other's eyes even now, in the silence?

God, she couldn't get enough air.

He wouldn't cheat...he isn't a cheater... That wasn't the man she fell in love with eighteen years ago, and married nineteen years ago; her husband was fiercely loyal, dedicated, loving, and honorable.

But then...he wasn't exactly that same man she'd married; the man sitting in that office was the same man who'd ordered one of this trusted club brothers to target and seduce an innocent woman. Locust and Nadia were still healing from that treachery.

No...the man sitting in that office, the one who could order that...she didn't know him.

And now uncertainty morphed into a slithering, slimy fear.

""I get it, Frost, I do,"" the young woman's voice filled with silence, the tone placating and a little 'see me, I'm right here, lean on me.' ""I'm sorry your life has been like that, but...it doesn't have to be that way anymore. You're se-xy, amazing, and you're still young. You have options.""

Mads gave a tight laugh, then offered, ""Yeah...I do...."" There was a flatness to his voice that made Em blink; she'd never heard him like that before. But it wasn't the tone that had ripped out a piece of her soul, it was that he agreed with Sarah.

He had options?

Like Sarah—the club skank with the perfect rack, peachy as-s, long legs, flawless skin, and not a single ounce of fat? Sarah, who didn't have that same pooch from nineteen years ago from carrying twins. Sarah, who hadn't breastfed to babies for over a year. Sarah, who didn't stress eat, then diet in a vicious cycle until her skin was a hormonal mess, complete with miles of stretch marks from all the yo-yoing. Sarah, who's hair was soft and golden and didn't have a single split end, because she had the time and effort to do whatever bullsh-it hair routine TikTok was raving about. Em's hair was just there, blonde but the dull kind, the kind that was washed in Target brand shampoo and left to dry in a ponytail because Em had sh-it to do and didn't have time to do more than that.

Sarah was young, skinny, beautiful, and took care of herself.

But she wasn't Sarah, and apparently, Mads had noticed.

How long? How long have I not been good enough that he now needs options?

Sucking in a breath to stop the spots from dancing in her eyes, Em tried to take a step back but couldn't. The pair of jeans in her hands were leaving marks in her skin from where she was squeezing them so tightly in her fists, her fingers ached from the force.

Sarah, not knowing she was tearing apart a marriage word-by-word, cooed, ""Hey, how 'bout we grab some food from Lowry's and head to that spot by the lake you showed me. It's beautiful there, and that big red tree is the perfect place for a picnic.""

Spot by the lake...big red tree....

Em gasped, quickly pressing her hand against her mouth to muffle the sound.

No. Sarah, the club who-re, the young, buxom, blonde release dumpster, couldn't be talking about the overlook on the lake on Mads's grandpa's property, the land the old man had gifted to Em and Madsen on their wedding day, the land where she had always hoped to build their dream home, but Mads kept putting it off, with one excuse after another. The land with the big red maple tree, the one Mads had carved their initials into twenty years ago when he'd made the promise to love her forever. Their spot. Their special place. For the two of them.

He'd taken her to their spot?

After a moment of weighty silence, her husband replied, ""Sure, yeah, that sounds good.""

And he was taking her there again. To their spot. On their land...where their dreams of a future, family, and forever had been etched into that same red maple tree.

The red maple tree she and Mads hand planted, by hand, when she was twelve and he was sixteen. It had symbolized their—then—budding friendship that had quickly turned to young love when she'd turned sixteen, and then forever love when she'd married him at eighteen, pregnant with their twins. That tree was them, their story, their timeline—roots, trunk, branches, and leaves.

And he was taking another woman to sit beneath those branches, to be shaded by the leaves, to settle against the trunk, and picnic on the soil nurturing those roots.

Tainted. Diseased. Withering. Dying. That tree was no longer a testament to the growth, strength, vitality, and longevity of their marriage...it was a carcas-s, still standing, but in need of culling.

He took her to our spot...is taking her again....

Had he...had he made l0ve to Sarah under the tree...as he had with Em all those years ago when she'd gifted him her virgin1ty...and he'd gifted her his. They were each other's first...under that red maple tree.

Had her husband, her one and only, taken another woman and given himself to her at the base of that tree, with only fallen leaves as a soft blanket beneath them? Had he slowly undressed her, or was it a desperate shedding of clothes fueled by raging desire for one another? Had he looked down at her n@ked body and compared it to his wife's, a body that had wear and tear, and stretch and sag? Had his eyes burned with lust and his body grow hot and hard with need for her, for the body that was perfect—unlike the worn, lumpy, not so shiny body of his wife?

Em's mouth flooded, bile rising to coat her tongue and teeth with sour acid, the need to vomit rising with it.

Trembling, Em finally found the strength to push away from the wall, to stumble down the corridor, back toward the door leading to the rear parking lot where she'd parked. Sliding into her 2024 Dodge Durango, she didn't remember anything after hitting the start button, but she had to have known where she needed to go because in a blink she was parked in the two-car garage of their home just outside of Wilkes-Barre, the one they'd bought when their family of four had outgrown the tiny apartment they'd rented right before Mads's first deployment. This house, with its two thousand five hundred square feet was only meant to be a stopover, a place to rest until their forever home on Granddad's land was built. But year after year, they remained, and year after year, Mads spent less and less time there, and now that the twins were off to college, it sat empty a lot of the time. She worked long hours as the owner and manager of Flower's Blooms, and Mads spent more and more time at the clubhouse. So the home that she'd painstakingly built over the years, the resting place, the safe haven, the heart and soul that she'd seeded, planted, and nurtured over the last fifteen years was now simply a cold, desiccated husk.

Sliding out of the driver's seat, Em set to work. She dropped the jeans she'd meant to give her husband on the kitchen counter beside her purse, then she headed to the smart home hub located on the wall in her home office. Mads had demanded they upgrade the house because he was tired of losing and then having to beg her to find his keys. Also, the home was wired with exterior cameras, window sensors, and all the bells and security whistles an MC president required in his home.

It's going to bite him in the as-s how, aint it?

Unlocking the system, Em proceeded to change the key code for the front and back doors. The interior garage door, leading into the kitchen, didn't have a key, since they only ever locked it once everyone was in for the night, so no one ever needed a key for it.

That, too, would bite Mads in the as-s.

The Flowers' home lockdown complete, her legs trembling, her chest aching as her heart attempted to lurch from it, she collapsed onto the floor just inside the back door, her limp and yet frozen body slumped against it.

Hands shaking, she took out her phone, sending a text she never thought she'd ever have to send.

QueenEm: CODE RED.

Sitting on the cold tile floor, in the kitchen of the home she'd built with the man she loved, the man who betrayed her, she promptly fell apart.

Frost groaned, throwing his head back, his throat working, his eyes closed tight, his body vibrating with unspent tension.

Fuuuuuck....

Ten days. It had been ten fu-cking days since he'd been home, since he'd seen his wife. It had been three days since he'd spoken with his wife, and that was three fu-cking days too long.

He ached with the absence of her.

And whose fu-cking fault is that?

Scrubbing his hand down his face, he heaved a sigh and leaned back in his desk chair, the aged leather creaking and the metal base squeaking with the movement. He could buy a new one, but this one was worn in, comfortable, fitting him perfectly.

Just like his marriage. Best friends for twenty-three years. A couple for twenty years. Married for nineteen years, two kids, six deployments from Fort Drum, two moves—from their tiny apartment to the house they currently lived in, and years of stress, drama, and other ups and downs with the Unchained MC.... Their relationship was older than some of the prospects looking to patch into the club, but that was one of the best things about it.

Right?

That his marriage was strong, uncomplicated...and...well, he was content.

At least he had been before the kids left for college, creating a vacuum where all-consuming chaos and noise once reigned. Now...there was silence, there was peace, there was...an emptiness he couldn't quite fill, especially now that Em wasn't there as often as she'd once been. Now...he had no idea what the fu-ck was going on.

Em, his Em, was his rock, his home, his reason. Em, his Em, his Bloom, had been with him from the very beginning, through all of his deployments in the Army, then all his long weeks away during road trips or long nights dealing with club business. His Em was used to long absences, some without contact for days or weeks at a time. But not once since he'd been discharged from the US Army had he and his wife gone so long without at least texting.

Yeah, he should have noticed on day one that she hadn't texted, called, or had one of the brothers check in on him—she was a good wife like that. Truth was, he could have reached out to her too, checked in on her, told her he missed her and wished he could be home with her, wished he could lay next to her in their bed, make l0ve to her. But...well...he didn't have an excuse. He'd been letting the bullsh-it with the Bone Dogz patch over, drama with the brothers and their women, and the upcoming Cool Hands costume party and fundraiser keep his head occupied.

He was jerked from his thoughts when his cell chimed with a text from his desk, where a pile of invoices still sat untouched. sh-it, he was never going to be out from under that pile of bullsh-it.

Maybe I should just let Patriot handle it...then maybe I can see my fu-cking wife again....

His phone chimed again, and he checked it.

Sarah: Thank you for lunch on Tuesday and yesterday. I can't believe how beautiful that place is.

Sarah: Do you think we can go there again tomorrow? Weather is supposed to be perfect.

A hot poker covered in acid impaled him.

fu-ck....

He scrubbed a hand down his face and pinched his eyes shut.

The moment he'd first set foot beneath that red maple tree with a woman who was not his wife, he'd known he'd done something irreparable. But...that day, he'd needed a moment, and Sarah had been vocally upset about something with her family back in New York, and he'd stupidly thought she could come with him, find peace and solace in the beauty and quiet of the back mountain property he and Em had owned for decades. He'd taken the truck, and Sarah had sat beside him, chatting about her issues with her mother, her hand reaching for his when she needed his strength, and once they'd parked at the fence line and gotten out of the truck, a weight had settled over him. An oppressive sense of wrongness that only added to his agitation over all the other bullsh-it he was dealing with. Rather than give in to it, to allow the stress of duty and obligation conquer him, he'd pushed forward, taking Sarah's hand to help her over the old log fence, and then leading her to the spot overlooking the small lake at the back of the property. He hadn't even noticed he was still holding her hand until she curled into him, sighing, at the sight of ""the spot."" The spot beneath the red maple tree he and Em had planted so long ago; a symbol of them, their growth, their relationship.

For fu-ck's sake, he carved their names into the bark of that tree the same night they'd taken each other's virginities.

Her voice soft, warm, filled with that sweetness he loved, she asked, ""What're you doin', Mads?""

He turned his head to look over his shoulder at her where she was laying, n@ked, her skin glowing in the moonlight, beneath a thin blanket on top of a sleeping bag he'd spread out to keep the chill of the ground away.

He couldn't stop the unrepentant and ravenous grin that lifted the corners of his mouth at the sight of her, his woman, his everything.

""I'm making a record of us, claiming this spot, this moment...for us,"" he replied, a feeling unlike anything he'd ever felt before filling him from his toes to this scalp.

With one last deep groove, Mads stepped back, the knife now loose in his aching fingers.

He felt her move, not needing to see her to know she was there, now standing behind him, the blanket wrapped around her beautiful body, a body he'd worshipped for hours that night.

Her breath against the back of his neck, he groaned when she pressed herself against his back, then wrapped her arms around his waist, holding him there, as though she were his anchor, and him her pillar.

""Wow, Mads...,"" she whispered, awe in her soft voice, ""it's amazing.""

He nodded silently, unable to tear his gaze from the permanent mark he'd left in the tree they'd planted three years ago. Red maples were fast growing, but they'd had no idea, when they'd planted it during Arbor Day when she was twelve and he was sixteen, that the tree would become a symbol of them. Em and Mads. And now it always would be.

""Mads loves Em 4-Ever,"" Em read, sighing.

His gaze, still riveted to the heart he'd etched deeply into the rough, gray bark of the tree, he barely heard her next words.

""Do you mean it?""

His heart slammed against his ribs as a warmth so like the heat of the sun overflowed from it. Turning, finally tearing his gaze from the tree, he looked down at the girl who'd owned that very same heart for as long as he could remember. Pulling her into his arms, he embraced her...and the bright, beautiful future they were going to have together.

Pressing a ki-ss to her head, he drew in a deep breath, and vowed, ""Until the day I die.""

That moment, twenty years ago, was still as fresh a memory as any he'd made that morning, and it was why he always returned to that tree, that spot, every time life became too fu-cking much.

Sarah had oohed and awwed at the sight, her issues with her family seemingly gone in an instant, and he was left with more internal upheaval than he'd had before he'd gotten in the truck. He knew he shouldn't have taken Sarah there the first time, but she when she'd asked again yesterday, he'd been...preoccupied, his mind a mine field of information, data, missed calls, missed texts, a cold, lonely bed, a cold, lonely heart, and when Sarah started talking about Em, like she seemed to do every time they were together...every mine in that mental mine field exploded at once. So, when she'd asked to go back, he didn't say no—she'd already been there before, what was the harm in taking her again? And, fu-ck, did he need at least that much, that moment under the tree where he'd once been happy with Em. She wasn't talking to him, wasn't checking in on him, wasn't being the wife and best friend he needed, so he'd take whatever the fu-ck he could from just sitting beneath the tree that meant something to the both of them.

And Sarah came along. They'd stopped for Chik-Fil-A, and sat beneath the branches of the tree. He ate, Sarah talked as he leaned against the bark of the tree, trying to absorb whatever energy he could from something Em touched, loved, cherished.

Like she'd once did him.

And whose fault is it that she doesn't give you the fu-cking time of day?

A ding of a text pulled him from his thoughts.

Sarah: I'm going to WNS. You want anything? I know you're out of Jack. You want the apple kind?

He almost smiled at that last question, because she knew d@mn well he thought apples belonged in pies not booze. He'd made a big deal about it at the last club BBQ when Cilla brought hard apple cider and tried to get him to try one. He'd been less than impressed.

Now, Sarah was going to the state-owned Wine & Spirits store, which meant she was on a run for one of the brothers and was asking if she could grab something for him while she was there.

Huh, that's thoughtful of her.... But that was Sarah; thoughtful. She was sweet as pie, always checking in on him, offering to get him things, showing she cared in a lot of little ways...like Em used to, back before she got busy being the boss lady. Now, it felt like he was an afterthought, something Em remembered when it suited her, and he was left puttering around in the periphery of her new life, one she obviously had no problem living without him.

When had they become like this; two separate people, living two separate lives?

When you became the as-shole who put more effort into the Bone Dogz than he did his own marriage?

fu-ck! That voice didn't know what the fu-ck it was talking about. His marriage had always been his priority, it was Em who started pulling away once the kids left for college.

Right?

Feeling his face pinch in a grimace, he reread Sarah's text, his thumbs hovering over the screen.

But he didn't message her back; he couldn't, not with the way he was feeling.

Confused. Charmed. Captivated. Contorted—like he was being twisted and pulled and bent in too many directions. How much longer before he gave out and simply...broke?

Sarah Yates. Twenty-two, high school dropout, child of a broken marriage, beautiful, and still sunny and hopeful despite all that life had thrown at her. She was new to his club, a club who-re that had moved to Unchained MC from the Bone Dogz previous clubhouse. When Frost had offered a home for the members and those under their protection, he knew the club would bring a few of their girls with them. Sarah was the only club who-re who'd made the move, though, stating that there was nothing keeping her in New York, and that she wasn't close with her family any longer, because they'd pretty much abandoned her when she'd moved in with the club. So, she'd moved from New York to Wilkes-Barre, and she'd quickly become a favorite among the single members of the Unchained. But it wasn't unhe1ltil she'd slunk over to sit next to him at the bar one night, months ago, that he'd actually talked to her.

She was intelligent, charming, witty, caring, and sensual. She'd used every trick in the club who-re manual to try and get into his bed that night, but he'd turned her down, reminding her that club who-res kept their hands off the brothers with old ladies. She'd blushed, seemed contrite, then asked if they could be friends. That was the problem, though, being friends with a club who-re was all kinds of awkward, but...she hadn't done anything wrong, and she was a breath of fresh air, and talking to her had stirred things in him that he hadn't felt in a long, long time. Since that first night, he'd found himself seeking her out, talking with her for long hours, sitting beside her, laying his head on her shoulder when the weight of his responsibilities became too heavy.

Yes, he knew he was using Sarah for what he should be giving to Em, but Em, well...she was busy being the badas-s boss b1tch at her business, a business she'd been dreaming about since she was thirteen. She was building success, and now that the kids were in college, she had more time to devote to her dream of being a professional florist. But where did that leave him?

Ignored. Forgotten. Pissed. Discontent. Out of sorts. Aching like a phantom limb.

It didn't help that she found out about you sending Locust on that fu-cked up mission to seduce an innocent woman.

Yeah, that had been one of the worst things he'd done in his life—he freely admitted that—and he could blame all the stress of the Bone Dogz patch over, but there was more to it...he just couldn't put his finger on it.

A knock on the doorjamb made him raise his head, and his gaze slammed into the hard, wary eyes of his VP.

""Need you in the conference room,"" Patriot said, his voice giving nothing away.

Heaving a sigh, Frost leaned back in his desk chair, and crossed his arms. ""Can't it wait? I've got sh-it to do."" Like figure out how to get out of taking Sarah to ""the spot"" again. Twice was already too many times, and if Em found out....

He couldn't stop the full body shudder even if he were made of stone.

Patriot's lips thinned, his eyes narrowing, he answered, ""No.""

That was it, that single word, and yet it carried a whole other meaning, one that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.

fu-ck.

Standing, his bones like jelly, his heart like cement, he followed his VP from the room, knowing that he wouldn't return to his office the same man who'd left.

Here’s why this wood continues to stand out:

* **Strength & Durability** Oak is known for its dense grain structure, which makes it highly resistant to wear. That’s why it’s often chosen for pieces that are meant to last for decades, from coffee tables to dining chairs.
* **Unique Grain Patterns** No two oak boards are alike. Its natural grain can range from straight and subtle to beautifully curved, which gives furniture character without needing much embellishment.
* **Aging Gracefully** Unlike some woods that lose their appeal with time, oak tends to get richer in tone. Exposure to light and air deepens its color, adding to the sense of warmth and history in a space.
* **Versatility in Design** Whether left in a light natural finish or stained darker, oak adapts well to both modern minimalism and traditional interiors.

For me, part of oak’s charm lies in how it doesn’t need to be flashy—its simplicity *is* the beauty.

I came here on a working holiday last year, and deeply fell in love. I managed to find work at what I thought was an amazing company, employed by what I thought was an amazing employer.

They would buy me things, take me for dinner, provide me with laptops, and even eventually giving me a flat to rent. The pay was very poor, below minimum wage for a long time, and then rose to ¥1200 around 6 months in (I know, taking below minimum wage is not a good sign, but I was a desparate immigrant who had no other reason not to trust a person who had given me so much)

Around the 6 month mark, I was promised a visa. At that time, I was also given a (fairly expensive) apartment. My boss promised me that once a work visa was acquired, he could raise my wage by a considerable amount. Again, no reason not to trust someone that had only done right by me for a considerable amount of time.

I landed an engineering/humanities/international services visa for 3 years and was over the moon. But as soon as this happened, little things started changing. No more food out, no gifts, no socializing (I didn't mind this so much, I don't expect a thing from my employer, and only want to work hard for them). But then it became more petty - no paid breaks, no breaks at all even, not being paid for business meetings outside of work hours, not being allowed to drink coffee or tea at work. They found out that I had drank some milk from the work fridge and genuinely threatened me with legal action. 

And then came the matter of my wage... They never raised it. I am now renting my bosses apartment, for a considerable sum, on ¥1200p/h. After tax, I am left with around 6万 to survive an entire month. I can't afford to eat breakfast, and have to eat the same meal everyday.

Now, I'm sure you're thinking 'why don't you just leave'. I made it clear to my boss that I felt trapped, and that I simply couldn't afford to live. I am hungry, I am stressed and I can't understand why things have gone this way. They responded by suggesting that they were going to call immigration, the police, future employers, etc. to ensure I was either deported/arrested or cannot secure future work. I feel like I have been slowly groomed into a life I cannot escape, and I'm scared for the future.

Does anyone know what protections I have in regard to my visa? I genuinely feel like my only option is trying to find a job in another prefecture and just living in a hostel until I can afford a real place. 

Can they really have that much of an impact on my future here? I am scared I am going to lose my new home.

I'm into psychology, religion, weightlifting, science and philosophy.

I have not watched TV in 20 years and rarely watch movies but wouldn't mind. I like to game but in moderation.

I'm very into nutrition and keeping fit, but I don't look like a bodybuilder or something, just a regular guy that tries and sometimes succeeds taking care of himself.

I've currently returned to college for a year, looking at management jobs.

I'm looking for somebody that is not focused on ambition or ""success"", that is content in life and does not feel that something is missing in them that they need to fix by validation from the outside world.

I'm very easy going and laidback, I love life, love to laugh and have fun and would not do well with people that are high strung, argumentative or that always needs to be occupying themselves in twenty different ways. If you're the kind of woman that is content just sipping a cup of coffee while reading a book, you would be perfect for me.

He said he was saving it to refill it. We have a full pack of new waters, that makes no sense so I called him out and said I knew he's lying. 

He kept up the lie for a bit until he broke down and admitted he lied because he was afraid I'd be mad. He could have just picked it up and said oops I forgot to throw this away and just throwing it away. But because he lied he made me mad. So he did the very thing he was trying to avoid.

That's so immature. He started to like almost cry when he admitted to lying over something so small. He's so annoying. I can't stand this relationship. I don't want to be with somebody like this. We're 32 and he acts like he's freaking 12.

He has horrible ADHD and is messy as hell..never cleans up after himself. It has gotten so bad, I told him If he ever leaves a mess again I'll kick him out. He still does it. He can't learn anything or do anything I ask, simple stuff like put your clothes in the laundry hamper or just wash your dish when you're done eating.

It's nothing complicated or hard and he can't do it it for me. But yet he can work at a restaurant and be trained but he can't be trained here. I don't understand.

It's ruining our relationship and it makes me mad on the daily and I fight with him weekly about it for the last 9 years and nothing has changed.

I have to ask him to shower everyday when he comes home from work instead of him just doing it. When his feet smells he will try to hide it like a little kid instead of just taking a shower. Like he will get in bed but have his feet weirdly hanging off because he thinks that will make them smell less???

He's an alcoholic. He's knows I grew up with alcohol parents. I refuse to talk to him or have conversations when he's drunk. When I hear him slurring his words it triggers me like how it did when I was a kid.

One time I woke up around 7am and saw a beer on top of the fridge. I grabbed it down and felt that it was full and cold, obviously it had just been opened. He tried to lie to me and say he wasn't drinking before work. I begged and begged him for years to quit drinking too. Just like I did with my mom as a kid. 

This morning he randomly tried to tell me he was going to try to take care of himself better and I said ""no you're not"" with a laugh. 
Tonight hes blackout drunk, like I expected. 

I can't believe I'm reliving my fucked up childhood by being with an alcoholic. He didn't even drink when we met.

Howdy folks! There’s lots of resources around explaining Tourette’s, but I couldn’t find any that used simple English. It was all complex and overly wordy or it was Thomas the ticcing turtle.   
I have a few friends with English as a second language—and it’s been so frustrating trying to find resources they can understand. Just a video or a website or \*anything\* which didn’t talk to fast and make the sentences too complicated. I’m not going to show a grown-ass adult a cartoon designed for three year olds. 

so in the end, I decided to commission the resource myself. I used short, simple sentences and lots of visuals to support the writing, without talking to the audience like toddlers. Hopefully someone else can get some use out of this <3",2,1759130435.0,Tourettes,0,1.0,False

**Scene: A quiet café, neutral territory. Yang Wenli sips tea while L crouches in his usual posture across the table, stirring his coffee with way too much sugar.**

**Yang Wenli:** (sighs) *You know, for someone who sits like that, your back must be in terrible shape.*

**L:** (calmly) *Posture is irrelevant. It keeps my brain alert. Besides, statistically, the way I sit decreases the likelihood of me being assassinated by 3%.*

**Yang Wenli:** (smirks) *3%, huh? I usually just rely on luck and my enemies being even more incompetent than I am.*

**L:** (stares intensely) *You downplay yourself. But history suggests you consistently win by anticipating what others consider improbable. That is not incompetence, but calculation.*

**Yang Wenli:** (shrugs) *Or maybe it’s just that authoritarian leaders and ambitious hotheads have a tendency to shoot themselves in the foot. Saves me the trouble of aiming.*

**L:** (takes a huge bite of cake, speaks with mouth full) *Still… you dislike power, yet you wield it effectively. Why?*

**Yang Wenli:** *Because someone has to. If I don’t, someone worse will. But tell me—why do you spend your brilliance chasing killers instead of doing something… normal?*

**L:** (pauses, eyes narrow) *Because when you face someone who thinks they’re justice itself, you can’t ignore them. Left unchecked, they reshape the world into their own reflection.*

**Yang Wenli:** (leans back, thoughtful) *Heh. Sounds familiar. Tyrants in uniforms, or tyrants with notebooks… not much difference in the end.*

**L:** (finally looks satisfied) *Precisely. I think we’d work well together. Provided you don’t drink all the tea.*

**Yang Wenli:** (chuckles) *And provided you leave me at least one slice of cake.*

Every year, software companies, hosting providers, and tool creators roll out massive discounts—sometimes up to 90% off. And if you’re even half-serious about growing your online presence, this is the time to stock up.

But here’s the kicker (and my personal confession): the first time I tried to snag an SEO Black Friday deal, I spent three hours comparing offers, missed the checkout deadline, and ended up paying full price two days later. Lesson learned: be prepared, make a list, and don’t let FOMO ruin your budget.

So let’s dive in. I’ll walk you through what SEO Black Friday deals really are, which categories of tools matter most, and the must-grab offers in 2025. Along the way, I’ll sprinkle in my own hard-earned wisdom (and occasional snark) about why these discounts are a blessing and a curse.

Lily placed a glass of warm water on the coffee table in front of me. The bottom made a soft ""click"" against the glass. I grunted in acknowledgment, not even looking up. My brain was stuffed with those damn business plans and user growth charts, no room left for anything else.

""Busy lately?"" she asked softly. ""Yeah, startup phase, you know how it is,"" I replied, my eyes still glued to the graphs. ""It'll be better once things settle down and get on track."" I'd said this so many times I almost believed it myself. Back then, I genuinely didn't see the problem. A man's gotta build his career, right? She should understand.

The turning point was last Wednesday night. I was up late searching for documents and wanted to use her old laptop. Her password was always our anniversary. I opened it. 

**There was a folder on the desktop named ""Can't Let Him See..."".** 

I clicked in. It was packed with screenshots. All of them were messages from me—promises I couldn't keep. ""I will watch that movie with you this weekend,"" ""Let's travel next month,"" ""I'll make it up to you once this project is over""... Under each screenshot, she had noted a tiny date.

But what really made my heart stop was the last document. She wrote about yesterday, her birthday, when I stood her up again for an impromptu meeting. She wrote: ""I finished the cake alone again. When I made a wish, I didn't know what to wish for. Should I wish for your company to succeed? Or should I wish... for you to come back? The first wish seems to be getting closer, but the second one feels further and further away."" After the date, she'd drawn a crying smiley face.

In that moment, it felt like an ice pick had been driven into my chest, the cold spreading instantly to my limbs. Those casual ""laters"" I'd tossed out were like blunt knives, leaving countless invisible scars on her. I thought I was building a castle for our future, completely unaware that the person I should cherish most was slowly using up all her hope and patience outside this prison I was building called my ""startup."" I slumped in the chair, overwhelmed by a wave of immense regret. What the hell was I doing?

Now, I look at her sleeping, my mind a tangled mess. The fire of my startup ambition is burning inside me, but it feels like I'm burning her in the process. Do I keep chasing this uncertain dream, or stop and hold onto the person who's right here? I really... don't know.",2,1759130211.0,u_Western_End_3584,2,1.0,False

I had never smoked. I had never touched any type of liquor in my life. For last eighteen years, I navigated the companionship of friends infamous for these very things, yet I resisted. That was my fortress. But recently, I moved to Bangalore, and the walls of that fortress crumbled. A long-distance relationship, her complete ignorance of my pain, and my own supercharged anxiety conspired against me. I had to smoke....
It was 3 AM on a Friday night, and the city was asleep, but my mind was screaming. In a moment of sheer desperation, I ordered a matchbox and a pack of ten cigarettes on Zepto. As soon as the delivery arrived, I smoked two of them, one after the other. The smoke felt foreign and foul, yet it was the only thing that seemed real. I somehow fell into a disturbed sleep and woke up on Saturday around 3 in the afternoon. The very first thought upon waking was a frantic urge. I rushed to the washroom and smoked another one. I couldn't understand this compulsion... I knew with certainty that my conscious self, the man who had been proud for three decades, did not want this. The same vicious cycle repeated itself on Saturday night. I smoked another three cigarettes, each one a nail in the coffin of my self-respect....
Then came Sunday. I woke up at 1 PM and called her. What followed was a log fight, a five-hour-long marathon of accusations and anguish that stretched until 6 in the evening. In the midst of that call, trapped in my single occupancy PG room, I tried to commit suicide two or three times. All this happened just after waking up, I hadn't even gotten out of bed, hadn't had a sip of water, but I was already at the edge of my existence....
At 6 PM, after all the drama, her phone disconnected. A dead silence filled the room. I looked at the remaining four cigarettes in the pack and, in a fit of despair, smoked all of them back-to-back within 10-15 minutes. After that, a strange calm took over. I brushed my teeth, took a bath, and wore a new shirt, as if trying to shed the skin of the person I had become. I left the room with no destination, just a desperate need to not be there. My only clear intention was that, since my ciggerate pack was empty, I would go have a cup of tea and buy a new one. Until this point, I had not eaten anything or even had a glass of water, but my entire focus was laser-sharp on getting another cigarette.....
I had the tea, but I didn't buy the cigarettes. A thought suddenly surfaced.. I had a flight to Chennai for work in a few hours. Maybe I should just go. I returned to the room, picked up my bag, booked a cab, and left for the airport. But I wasn't ready. My heart, my soul, my entire being didn't want to go to Chennai. I stopped the cab midway and just got out. I didn't want to go back to the room either. It was around 10:15 PM. I went to a nearby shop and bought a single cigarette. I stood there, smoking it shamelessly in public. When I was done, a wave of disgust washed over me. ""What the fuck did I just do?"" I thought......
Then, her call came. I hadn't mentioned that after I left the room, we had spoken briefly, and it seemed like we were on good terms, finally. So, when she called, we talked. I just sat there on the staircase of an ATM on the bank of a busy road. It was the first time in my life I had been out without any purpose, an urban ghost just trying to avoid the haunting of his own room. She talked her part, but as the conversation was about to end, the same vibe returned...... nothing was fixed. My anxiety kicked in with full force....
I sat there alone until 12:30 AM, my mind a blank slate of despair. My greatest anxiety hit. I called her. She was sleeping and didn't even try to inquire where I was. I had tried to end my life in front of her just hours earlier. She knew where I was sitting, but she just didn't seem to care. Finally realizing I had to return, I booked another cab. Inside the cab, I called her again. I didn't want to, but my anxiety never lets me win. We talked on WhatsApp for a few minutes, but it wasn't what I needed... it couldn't cure the tremor in my soul. Hehe.. while writing this I remembered that dialogue of Kundan from Raanjhanaa, ""Ye ladki jo murda si aankhe liye baithi hai abhi kah de to Mahadev ki kasam...""
When I got back to my PG, I rushed to a shop that was luckily still open and bought three more cigarettes. I went to my room and smoked two of them straight away, then just fell onto the bed. I frantically tried to get sleeping pills through instant delivery apps, but they all required a prescription. I even tried a tele-consultation on a medical app, but the doctor was of no use.....
I had a heavy, gnawing urge to smoke that last cigarette. But I resisted. Instead, I started drinking water...liters of it. Whenever I felt the urge to call her or to have that cigarette, I drank a full bottle of water. At 5 AM, the strongest urge yet hit me...to call her and cry again, my self-respect now a distant memory. I resisted. I ran to that last cigarette, held it in my hand, but I didn't light it. I took it, looked at it, and just put it back on table. I came back, ordered milk and coffee sachets, and made the strongest cup of coffee I could....
Now it's 6:50 in the morning. I have to leave for the office by 8 and have to face the worst day of my career at work, as i have missed going Chennai, and I'm still lying on the bed, struggling with the greatest tickles in my whole body, my legs and hands twitching uncontrollably. I know only two things can fix this right now.... her call or a cigarette. But for the first time, I just don't want either of them.",1,1759130027.0,RelationshipIndia,6,1.0,False

Fasting goals: lose belly fat, improve health, have more energy during the day.  I want to reach 85kg (187 lbs), more or less my university weight many, many years ago... :-)

Exercise:  I swim 30 min in the sea every weekday (8 months each year).  4 months (Winter) I walk 45 mins every weekday.  I do yoga 3x per week. I've just introduced push ups, trying to do 50 per day (currently at only 10 but slowly improving).

Newly implemented fasting regime:

I do IF every day with a 5-6 hour window (usually 1pm - 6pm).  Typically 2 meals.  I'm trying to target 1800 daily calories (2000 is probably maintenance).  I'm now trying to reduce processed sugars considerably, I still eat fruits (berries, grapes, dates, occasional banana) in moderation.  I only drink water and coffee, and an occasional glass of red wine (max 1x per week, usually less).  I live in the Mediterranean, so hard to eliminate red wine completely.  :-)

I do a 48-hour fast every Monday.  My last meal is Sunday late afternoon, and I don't eat again until Tuesday afternoon.

When I fast, I only drink water or black coffee.

Thoughts on this system?  Is anyone trying something similar?  What are some concerns for my age?  I feel great, btw, no health issues.  Just too much belly fat.

I have done IF before, but never religiously.  I've always liked it, I feel I have more energy.  But this was probably wasted by eating too much in general, especially bread (I love it), sweets (brownies!), pasta, and pizza...  New change in IF:  I count calories and try to stay at 1800 (after exercise), and I've dramatically reduced carbs and sugars.  This started 2 weeks ago.

I've fasted before, but not really in a system.  Just occasionally.  But the results were always positive (with one exception, described below), my body felt surprisingly great.  That was what surprised me the most, I assumed fasting was going to be incredibly difficult, but anything under 48 hours is easy for me.

My only issue was a 3+ day fast I attempted a couple of months ago.  After 3 full days, I didn't feel great.  The entire 3rd day was a challenge tbh.  2 days are fantastic, but 3 days are maybe too much for me...  Should I try to go for 3+ days on occasion, or just accept 2 days are my sweet spot?

I think my new system should work well.  I've fasted before, including IF, but never really systematically. I think a more structured approach should help a lot.

But I'd love to hear your thoughts!  Maybe I can improve this? Thanks!!",1,1759129878.0,fasting,2,1.0,False

I miss you so much. 

I think I died with you. I think whatever infection I picked up from the London sewers Tails unleashed on me killed me. This strange barren world I found myself in must be a dream, or Hell. Multiple versions of you? Robots you never created? Versions of Sonic's friends from worlds so horrible they make ours look like a paradise? This just can't be real. But, I have no reason to behave as though it isn't. Either my actions here don't matter at all, or they matter more than ever. All the more reason to do my best. 

The versions of you I've found here are interesting. They're you. Clearly, they're you. But they're different. Their personalities, their voices, their histories, are all slightly different. And none of them look at me the way you do. God, I would do anything to see your dark eyes again. To hear you drink one of my lattes. To shave your beautiful head. 

One of the robots I met is a creation of some other version of you. Sage. Well, she's more of an AI, I guess. Her vision for your empire is the closest to what you've described to me, and to what I envision myself. Whichever of your alternates in this strange world she backs, I will too. My loyalty is to you, but when you are many... I am still just one.

The only other human I've encountered here is a scientist who wants to restart GUN. He's pretty openly racist against the aliens, which... while understandable, doesn't really work for me. Nor does his callous, uncaring nature. But I intend to work with him. 

You see, I've been thinking about what happened to you, and your family.  How did the world go from the greatest scientific mind on a project to understand an alien, to said mind exploiting you to destroy a world? 

It's simple.

GUN. 

Guardian Unit of Nations is the problem. Every project they've ever done, they've only done in half measures, chickening out at the last second and irresponsibly covering it all up. First they tried to weaponize Shadow. Then they murdered a little girl. Then they weaponized your grandfather. They even effectively weaponized you. And they're trying to do the same to Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles after losing control of you: creating more problems to throw at a problem they created. Soldiers should be soldiers. Not children, not aliens, not orphans. 

I will avenge you and your family, sir. I may not be able to stop GUN in the world we come from, but I can keep it from taking hold here. I will completely annihilate the name and everything it stands for, and everyone who stands for it. I will not allow GUN to take from anyone else the way they took Maria from Shadow, or you from me. 

And as far as that guy knows? I'm an ex agent who was full time caretaker for another ex agent: harmless and probably useful. I'll bide my time. He won't even see me coming. 

I miss you. 

I love you. 

And you didn't die in vain. 

Forever Yours, 
Aban Stone

   And David… oh, David was made for it.
He thought he was chasing her attention, but the moment she called him “my little Drone” he was already caught.
At first, it was small:
$10 for her coffee.
$10 when she whispered “buzz.”
$40-$80 when a dynamic was in session...

Each time his chest tightened, cock straining, because it wasn’t about the money. It was about her voice, her laugh, her smile when she sent him a photo of the new outfit she was getting,the way she turned every dollar into proof that he belonged to her. 

Soon, Tammy had him whispering mantras in the dark:
“I am Tammy's wallet. I am her property. My worth is hers to measure.”
And he believed it. He could feel her in every aspect, the way his thoughts filled with her day by day.
    
  The kink wasn’t just financial.
It was humiliation, watching her nails glint in photos paid for with his rent money.
It was denial, being told he wasn’t allowed to cum unless he sent tribute first.
It was ownership, when she mocked him for being a drone, yet praised him sweetly when he obeyed.

One night, Tammy called him.
She laughed while he begged, demanded he empty his account in $20 bites, cooing every time her phone chimed.

But there is another sort of inequality that is not so lamented but is more destructive. The billionaires don't figure in this. It is the headstart that the upper-middle class has on the rest in all the turfs where they compete with those below them.

In almost everything they do, billionaires and their children are not in competition with the rest of society. They have their own charmed universe where they do not even properly mingle with people who do not come close to their wealth. But consider the asset millionaires: they compete unfairly with the rest of society in entrance exams, finance jobs, the start-up culture, in cinema, literature, and the arts. Their head start is not in their material assets alone, which is an overrated part of privilege. Their true unfair advantage is in social contacts and the doors of the clubs that they hold to control who enters. Seen this way, the billionaires are far less guilty of inequality than what the upper-middle class creates. The objective of any family, whatever be its resources, is to provide an unfair advantage to its children.

Can something as pervasive as inequality be solved? Or is inequality the most natural consequence of human nature? Actually, what the hell is equality? Is equality one of those thought experiments of European philosophers, like equilibrium, black body, and Marxism, which their acolytes have taken too seriously as an actual state that can be achieved? An amusing thing about inequality is that the people who talk the most about it are all beneficiaries of it. Is social ‘inequality’ like gender inequality, merely a complaint by the 98 percentile against the 99th percentile? Mere millionaires loathing multi-millionaires; multi-millionaires loathing billionaires.

The very question of solving inequality presupposes it is an anomaly to be fixed, rather than the default operating system of human society. The master and the servant existed long before capitalism; the form changes, the hierarchy remains, Even if inequality is a natural consequence of human advancement, it does not mean it is not evil. We do not have to consecrate all that is natural.

Even so, all things considered, the poor of Mumbai today have a higher standard of life than Mughal emperors. Andrew Carnegie, while accepting that inequality is a creation of capitalism, wrote in ‘The Gospel of Wealth’, ‘Much better this great irregularity than universal squalor.’

But this is not a correct perception of poverty. Poverty is relative. The very existence of the rich creates poverty. The poor in a rich region may come with some higher standards of life, like the ability to buy denim jeans and a smartphone, it is worse to be poor in a rich region than to be so in a poor nation, A smartphone in the hands of a poor man in a rich city is not a marker of progress; it is a constantly glowing screen displaying everything he will never have.

The mechanism of greed can increase the general quality of life but cannot fix inequality because the whole point of greed is inequality. Do-gooding is inefficient because it attracts exactly those people who are useless in solving anything, the modern history of India is living proof.

There is another way of looking at the issue. If you use money as a measure, there will never be equality because that is the nature of money. To that end, inequality is a false lament.

People do feel lucky about their gifts, their youth, health, family, love, beauty, strength, intellect, and how gorgeous their village is. They are not in the perpetual gloom of being in the bottom 50 per cent at all. Yet, because money is so easy to measure, they are trained to consider themselves lesser people.

The failure of the world is not in creating economic equality, which cannot exist in the real world in any case. The failure of the world is its inability to show people the truth that money is just one of the things that matter Intellectuals have tried, of course, through their happiness indices.

People desperately want many experiences that they can see in the lives of the most visible section of the rich, not the billionaires but the upper-middle classes. And everything that people desperately want becomes a ‘basic necessity’ of life.  The world continues its descent into a monoculture of aspiration, where every experience seen on an influencer’s Instagram from a foreign holiday to artisanal coffee becomes a new ""basic necessity,"" and its absence a new form of poverty. As long as there is a visible rich, the poor will be perpetually reinvented.",1,1759129495.0,u_Spare-Swing5652,0,1.0,False

Just got back from an assignment in Europe and noticed most local WhatsApp groups are… well, not really engaging 😅. So I figured, why not start something new?

This group is meant for:

Expats →
• Inter-district expats: People from other districts of Tamil Nadu now living in Tirunelveli.
• Inter-state expats: People from other states who’ve moved here for work, study, or business.
• International expats: Anyone from outside India currently in Nellai.

Working professionals (IT, corporate, teaching, healthcare, etc.)

Students (college/university level)

Businessmen & entrepreneurs


Plan is simple → casual coffee meetups, walks at VOC, and even meetups over Karuppati Coffee at Palayamkottai ☕. Just real conversations beyond the usual “Good Morning” forwards 🌞.

We’ll also have a weekly introductory session every Wednesday – a quick round where new members introduce themselves and connect with the group.

✅ Note: Only verified members will be added to keep the group specific and meaningful.

📝 Quick verification (before joining):
When you DM, please share:

1. Your Name 


2. Where you’re from (district/state/country)


3. What you do (student, working, business, etc.)

If you are a student please share your age.



I already got one colleague in, so the group is slowly growing. If you’re up for making new connections in Nellai, drop a comment or DM me. I’ll share the invite link after verification.

📌 Basic Rules (for a healthy vibe):

1. 16+ age group only.


2. Mutual respect for everyone – no personal attacks.


3. Politics allowed, but keep it respectful and open-minded.


4. No adult content, no profanity.


5. No spam, no random forwards.


6. Keep discussions inclusive – English or Tamil preferred so all can follow.


7. Introductory Wednesday – if you’re new, say hi to the group!


8. If you plan a meetup, share details clearly so people can decide to join.

1ntbccy,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/1ntbccy/is_my_visa_really_tied_to_my_job_or_am_i_being/,Is my visa really tied to my job? Or am I being 'detained',"So this is kind of difficult to explain, please bare with me.

I came here on a working holiday last year, and deeply fell in love. I managed to find work at what I thought was an amazing company, employed by what I thought was an amazing employer.

They would buy me things, take me for dinner, provide me with laptops, and even eventually giving me a flat to rent. The pay was very poor, below minimum wage for a long time, and then rose to ¥1200 around 6 months in (I know, taking below minimum wage is not a good sign, but I was a desparate immigrant who had no other reason not to trust a person who had given me so much)

Around the 6 month mark, I was promised a visa. At that time, I was also given a (fairly expensive) apartment. My boss promised me that once a work visa was acquired, he could raise my wage by a considerable amount. Again, no reason not to trust someone that had only done right by me for a considerable amount of time.

I landed an engineering/humanities/international services visa for 3 years and was over the moon. But as soon as this happened, little things started changing. No more food out, no gifts, no socializing (I didn't mind this so much, I don't expect a thing from my employer, and only want to work hard for them). But then it became more petty - no paid breaks, no breaks at all even, not being paid for business meetings outside of work hours, not being allowed to drink coffee or tea at work. They found out that I had drank some milk from the work fridge and genuinely threatened me with legal action. 

And then came the matter of my wage... They never raised it. I am now renting my bosses apartment, for a considerable sum, on ¥1200p/h. After tax, I am left with around 6万 to survive an entire month. I can't afford to eat breakfast, and have to eat the same meal everyday.

Now, I'm sure you're thinking 'why don't you just leave'. I made it clear to my boss that I felt trapped, and that I simply couldn't afford to live. I am hungry, I am stressed and I can't understand why things have gone this way. They responded by suggesting that they were going to call immigration, the police, future employers, etc. to ensure I was either deported/arrested or cannot secure future work. I feel like I have been slowly groomed into a life I cannot escape, and I'm scared for the future.

Does anyone know what protections I have in regard to my visa? I genuinely feel like my only option is trying to find a job in another prefecture and just living in a hostel until I can afford a real place. 

Can they really have that much of an impact on my future here? I am scared I am going to lose my new home.

He’s only here for a quick vacay (about a week left), but we’ve been talking for months and even have inside jokes. One of them is that he “owes me coffee.”

A few nights ago, he sent me a video of him having dinner with his friends. I jokingly said, “Where’s mine?” and he replied, “Show up.” The next day, when I went out with my own friends, I flipped it back on him and said “show up.” He said he already had plans but mentioned he’d be watching a game the next day and going for a run — and that I could bring my friends if I wanted.

Fast forward to the next day, I finally asked him straight up if he wanted to grab coffee with me. His response?

* “I’ll go on a trip tomorrow.”
* “But I’ll ask my friends if they want to go either Tues or Wed.”
* “I’ll just hit you up if we’re going.”

Like…??? Bro. I didn’t ask your friends, I asked you. 😭

So now I’m stuck wondering: is this just him dodging without saying no, or is he actually interested but only in group hangouts? We’ve built up rapport, jokes, and history, so the way he worded it felt like a deflection.",3,1759129169.0,AskMenAdvice,17,0.8,False

I had finished smoking 5 mins before we all hear a continuous knock from the rooms door (the balcony was inside my elder sisters room) . as we were smoking my sister turned off the rooms ac and opened the other windoes so there’s no smell of any ciggs. 

My mom came and asked us what is this smell? She then smelled my hands and told me and my sister to get out of the room. My sister had a coffee mug in her hand she went to the kitchen to wash the mug so she could wash her hands to get rid of the smell. My mom bombed us w many questions we denied everything saying we dk. 

My mom then went back to the room and found a lighter in the balcony. I didn’t carry any lighter w me. It was one of the 3 other ppl who left it in the balcony as well were in a rush. She brought the lighter and said to not lie then she brought a bag that i take to my coaching and turned it upside down then 3 lighters and a box of ciggs fell too where there was 3 ciggs in the box. She then proceeded to beat the shi out of me and called my dad whos out of town for work and told him everything. She even sended a vid recording of me sitting in the dinning table and theres the stuff that fell from my bag right infront of me. 

My sister admitted she smoked once a month. She’s in uni and 20 yrs old and a really religious person so my mom didn’t say much to her. I got caught w vapes 2 times and brushed it off by saying its my friends or smth and im not a practicing religious person so my mon always hated me for it and used to scold me to be religious like my sister and im 17. My family overall is really conservative and religious, they have a problem w clothes,guy friends etc basically everything.

So my mom was suspicious ab me for a while and wanted to catch me red handed. My mom then accused me of doing some sort of drugs and all which i don’t. She asked me how do i get the money for buying ciggs cuz my parents parent’s dont give me any money. But my friend did but that ciggs for me still I didn’t snitch on that friend or anything. 

I don’t have a good relationship w my mom since i was way younger. I avoid talking w her most of the time unless its a necessity cuz she used to physically abuse like hit on her all kids at some stage. My mom told me i can’t even leave my house, i’m a liar, she won’t ever trust me, she told me kms. 

My sister is saying to tell my mom my cousin A and i smoked tgt and we won’t do it again. But I don’t wanna snitch on the cousin they are basically like my cf. My sister was the first one to go in the balcony if it wasn’t for her i would never go at that time and never get caught. 

My dads coming to the house after 2 days. I don’t know what to do. I don’t wanna get beaten up anymore. And my mom keeps on passing all kind of dirrty comments since yesterday for ts i cant even study at peace and my board exam is in 20 days. Both of my parents are saying how as a female i can do smth disgusting as smoking (yes they both are sexiest)

I'm an author who has been sharing their work for years and have a sizable following on Tumblr/Twitter/Bluesky. I started with fanfiction years ago, and then moved to original fiction and stuff in the public domain (specifically Greek mythology). This is where most of my current followers come from, btw, not the fanfiction, though there's a few still following me for that because those works are still up on my various platforms. I have 2 greek myth-inspired serials going on as well as 1 original, and I am also currently preparing 2 novels for self publication.

At the start of this year I started a patreon in the hopes of making some sort of income from my writing, even a small one. I wasn't looking for big bucks or anything. Some of my followers had said they would be happy to be offered a tip jar of sorts so they could support my work, and this was how I started the patreon. I wasn't offering a whole lot of exclusive stuff, mostly previews of my upcoming stories (typically a few pages long each week or so), behind-the-scenes commentaries and thoughts on writing, some deleted scenes, etc. No advance chapters or anything like that, which I hear is what most writers do. 

As soon as I launched my Patreon I got several patrons right off the bat, about half of them my friends and the rest what I assume to be die hard fans, and also a bunch of free members. I felt really inspired and motivated by this, the money I was making was not an insane amount but it was enough to cover my phone bill and some of my coffee shop writing sessions lol so that felt like a great start.

Fast forward to a couple months after I launched my Patreon, I got seriously physically ill. To the point where for the first time in all the years I've been writing, I couldn’t keep to my updating schedule. At first I tried hard to push through it, and that went on for a couple months, but then both because of health complications and also a bunch of doctor's appointments/tests/etc, I simply couldn't keep up with either writing or Patreon. Just getting up in the morning and going to work was all I could do. I had to pause my Patreon billing for a couple months, and I also made an announcement on both my socials and Patreon, and everyone was really understanding. I did lose a couple patrons but that's understandable, the majority of the people that had initially pledged did not leave though. 

Now it's been a couple months that I've started feeling better, and I'm almost back to my former writing schedule. I even decided to make some changes to my Patreon tiers and benefits in the hopes of offering the people who have supported during this time more rewards. My tiers and pricing are as follows:

T1 - $1 
- extended sneak peeks into upcoming chapters that I don't get to share on my socials
- behind the scenes/writing commentaries on specific works/chapters 

T2 - $3 
(All previous tier benefits)
- early access to chapters of my currently updating serials
- one patreon exclusive short story per month
- access to polls to decide the short story of the month, or which serial I should focus on for the month

T3 - $5
(All previous tier benefits)
- advance draft chapters of currently updating serials (about 2-3 more chapters than previous tier), as well as first look into new projects before anyone else
- full chapters of the original novel I'm currently working on as I prepare it for publication

I've been working hard on creating a back log, and I've also been more active on my socials etc, connecting with followers again and promoting my writing and my patreon, but so far I haven't had much traffic. I haven't had any new patrons, which I think is to be expected, but what worries me is that I'm not even getting free members anymore, when I used to get a couple new ones every time I promoted my patreon before I got sick.(The reason I care about free members is that they may convert into paid members eventually, and it also shows that there is some interest in what I'm doing on Patreon) 

My readership hasn't declined, I still get the same engagement I used to when I post new chapters, but little to no traffic on Patreon. Just opening up the app has gotten really depressing lately ngl lol, when nothing seems to be happening no matter how often I post. 

So now my questions are these: what do you think of my current pricing/rewards? Is there something seriously wrong with them that would prevent me from getting new patrons, or is it just too soon to tell? Should I keep going or have I irreparably hurt my chances of growing my patreon because of my illness this year? I just can’t help but think that my readers won't trust that I will deliver on my promises going forward because of how inconsistent updating became for a big chunk of this year, even though it's been back to normal for the last couple of months.

I (30M) live in a Western US city with a pretty big music scene and mountains and lots of outdoor sports. Most of my free time is spent hanging with friends, rock climbing, skiing, and going to concerts. 

Anyway I was planning on going to a concert next weekend with one of my close friends (35F) who happens to be a girl. We’ve been friends for like 2 years and hang out pretty regularly. While I find her a beautiful and amazing person there is no attraction between us. We regularly talk to each other about dating n’ such

Anyway I matched with a girl (32F) on Hinge today and we got to talking and she is going to the concert too and wanted to meet up there. And like thinking from her perspective it could be kinda odd to show up and see me there alone with another girl even if we are just friends. 

Is this a valid concern? Or should I just tell my Hinge date before hand? Should I suggest we go out for coffee or drinks one day before the concert and I could tell her then?

Can anyone give me any guidance?,"He's in his 50s. Don't think he's gone dry a single day since he was last in the clink over a decade ago. He solely works at bars/restaurants so he can drink during his shifts. Recently lost his job due to passing out drunk in the middle of the floor in the kitchen (I've seen the footage... I'm not really one to judge, have had my own problems, but it's embarrassing.) He's been homeless for a few weeks.

""Broke into"" someone's basement to sleep for a while. I put it in quotes because it was unlocked, but still, he wasn't supposed to be there. Got charged for it. Went to court drunk as a skunk.

I don't like my friends sleeping outside when I've got a perfectly fine and empty couch to crash on. Told him he could stay here until he figured his shit out. But he doesn't even drink coffee in the morning anymore. He wakes up, hits the bottle until he passes out, and the second he's conscious enough to drink again, he does. He's eaten essentially nothing since I picked him up a week ago. I tricked him into ""trying how bad this pepper from the garden is"" and got him to eat a slice of pizza. That's about it. 

Guy's pissing all over my floor. He's fallen and (mildly) hurt himself multiple times. It's full-time babysitting.

Told him he needs to dry out, but he keeps having friends bring him another bottle while I'm sleeping and shit. I can't be 24/7, even working from home, I need at least a few hours of sleep a day.

What the fuck can I do for the guy? I'm so stumped, and I almost feel like he's chosen here to drink himself to death at. Literally looking at him sleeping on my counter at the moment, having only had moments of consciousness where his eyes damn near roll back into his head. If he were to have a stroke or something, I'm not sure I'd even be able to tell. Any help would be appreciated.

I'm in south central Wisconsin, US, for the record. Not really any shelters or anything I can just dump him at, as heartbreaking as that would be anyways.",1,1759128665.0,Advice,9,1.0,False

\- Wendougee Lita BA. Using it for the last month. Initially found the menus and the app very cryptic, but after a few days everything clicked. Sometimes it fails to follow the flow rate I've set but in general it's very good.

1ntb2yk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ntb2yk,How I make my perfect Moka,"u/emotional_display983 as promised.

1) Water UNDER the safety valve. 

2) Coffee NOT pressed. Some geniuses even make a so-called ""dome"" here, so the coffee is pressed, making it difficult for steam to pass through, increasing the pressure and leading to an explosion if the safety valve fails or if the genius has the smart idea to block it with water. 

3) In Italy we have a special, smaller burner specifically for coffee, but regardless of how you apply the heat, it must be as gentle as possible. 

4) Wait patiently. Read a newspaper, listen to a song, gaze at the sky. Questo è il risultato. Nel commento sotto aggiungo un video.

By not speeding up the flow and not overdoing the temperature, not too many molecules have been extracted, which give that bitter, perhaps slightly acidic, flavor that anyone who has had an espresso in an Italian bar is surely familiar with. The flavor is perfect like this; there's no need to add sugar. 

Oh, and don't forget to stir it directly in the Moka pot before pouring it, so that the extracted molecules are evenly distributed.

If you like, turn on the heat, put 3/4 teaspoons of sugar in a large glass, add the first 3/4 drops of coffee that come out (no more) and stir as fast as you can, it will create a frothy cream that you can add (a little!) to the coffee to sweeten it.

P.S. My Moka is 40 years old, and she's never seen soap. Only hot water and love.

I (30M) live in a Western US city with a pretty big music scene and mountains and lots of outdoor sports. Most of my free time is spent hanging with friends, rock climbing, skiing, and going to concerts. 

Anyway I was planning on going to a concert next weekend with one of my close friends (35F) who happens to be a girl. We’ve been friends for like 2 years and hang out pretty regularly. While I find her a beautiful and amazing person we have no attraction between us. We regularly talk to each other about dating n’ such

Anyway I matched with a girl (32F) on Hinge today and we got to talking and she is going to the concert too and wanted to meet up there. And like thinking from her perspective it could be kinda odd to show up and see me there alone with another girl even if we are just friends. 

Is this a valid concern? Or should I just tell my Hinge date before hand? Should I suggest we go out for coffee or drinks one day before the concert and I could tell her then?

1ntazip,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1ntazip/one_last_message_and_unspoken_sentiments/,One last message (and unspoken sentiments),"Strangers tag because you never truly allowed me to know you, and I'm growing out of the person I was when I was with you.

This letter is an amalgamation of various thoughts, some of which I would never feel safe or comfortable expressing directly to you, but since we will probably never talk again, it's whatever. It's something that began as a reply in your message box and quickly turned into a journal entry (thankfully, my self control seems to be working)...that I decided to post here, because part of me still wishes for my feelings to reach you, in the off chance that you weren't lying about...well, a lot of things.

I'm sorry for my part in ruining this. Don't respond. I think it's for the best we don't talk (I say this partly bc I'd be heartbroken if I didn't and you still don't respond, since you have a penchant for leaving me hanging). I don't think I'm wrong in wanting to make sense of my pain that was caused by you, but neither are you in defending your perspective.

We've both hurt each other. We do not trust each other, and I'm not sure if we ever could again, as much as I want us to. I guess I was wrong in thinking we could ever fix this and be friends. Well, in the way I see friends anyway. We may never see eye to eye on what happened, and it seems we have very different needs and expectations out of friends, and partners.

My feelings about you are...mixed, to say the least, though I think it boils down to the same thing in the end. I despise you for treating me the way you did, but I love you enough to forgive you and feel a little nervous and overjoyed every time I hear from you, but my instinct to protect myself will always make me push you away in the end. After all that's happened, I don't feel safe around you, and it will take a lot to regain that sense of safety, which you're unable to give me, for which you might have your own reasons that I don't know of.

Regardless, my feelings for you are strong, and that is...all the more reason we shouldn't talk. You're with her now, so be with her. I can't help but to think you don't really look happy with her. Your smile doesn't reach your eyes like it did in the pictures I took of you wearing V's (I's?) oversized leather jacket, or like it used to before you first came over... Eh, could just be my imagination though. Or maybe you did it on purpose, to see if I'm still addicted to your slot machine love.

I know I said ""don't come back when you're tired of your new plaything"". I 100% meant that. I meant everything I said to you, even though I apologized all those times, I think it was unnecessary now. I don't feel bad for reminding you of a past you insist on running away from, on keeping me from remembering correctly. Just a tad embarrassed really bc I see now that you really didn't care. Fair though, I can't force you to.

I was watching Big Hero 6 today and Gogo really reminded me of you. I thought of texting you, but I won't. You're nothing but a bad habit I need to cut. Possibly worse than the most addictive and brain numbing hard drug. No wonder no efforts at reconciliation ever work with you, and no wonder you get me hook, line, and sinker each time you come back for a minute and dip for the next couple months.

You never wanted this relationship to work, and I'm only now seeing it for what it was: an experiment. I stupidly fell for it too. In my defense, I was (am) going through a pretty intense pluto transit. You probably know though. You always seem to know odd things about my life. You know, you're weirdly obsessed with me for someone who doesn't love me...

Then again, I don't know the first thing about love...but I was willing to move mountains for you. For someone like you...ew.

In two months, I hope your hold over my soul will have eased completely. I hope that the next time you come back, I'm able to turn and walk away without a word, even if it still hurts. I hope I regain my self control enough to choose what's right for me this time. A part of me still aches for you, to be held by you, reassured, comforted, wanted...loved by you. It's the same part that craves a cigarette every time I crash out, or every time I have a coffee or a beer or go on a walk, the part that has made me hurt myself on multiple occasions. That impulsive, reckless, self-destructive part of me. It's the devil in my right brain taunting me with illusions it spins from my own hopes that aren't going to manifest.

It's kind of silly, but I have the tendency to romanticize things, so when I thought about how we met in fall, parted ways come spring, only for you to return at the first sign of fall, and how you said I was ""green"", I became convinced you were the Hades to my Persephone. Funny that I was with my mom during spring and summer too. I always thought you were purple though, purple and yellow like the asters, or purple like hyacinths. More Apollo, and not mine to keep. Even so, I was enamored by you, and I still think you have the prettiest smile. Maybe stop smoking so much though, it'll ruin your teeth.

Anyway, that is all. I'll keep writing these letters until I no longer feel inclined to. I don't intend to send them, but I will sometimes wonder if you're out here reading them.

I don't really know you well, since you were always so damn guarded, so it's hard to tell, but I feel like I found you here on more than one occasion, but the mind tends to plays tricks when you're consumed by a feeling that has driven poets and artists mad throughout history. My only hope is to be free of my attachment to you so I can make space for bigger and better things. You really, really wear me out (and I'm not okay, even if I said I was).

When kids my age got birthdays in movies or when I was invited to a party, their parents never argued and always got them gifts. Thoughtful gifts that showed their parents knew who they were. 

When I got a birthday, my parents spent most of the day screaming. I hated being stared at but was forced to open my presents in front of my family, then was scoffed at for not being ‘reactive’ enough. (Thanks, autism) When I got old enough that my parents stopped feeling ‘obligated’ to give me anything, I stopped getting anything. Sometimes, only my mother would even say happy birthday. 

I’m not a materialistic person. I just like when people think of somebody, y’know? If my parents and brother had drawn a card together I would’ve absolutely loved it. But they never did. They didn’t even buy cards while they were grocery shopping or whatever. 

I didn’t fully understand that as a kid. That I wanted my family to appreciate me the way I tried to appreciate them. But I knew I hated birthdays (and celebrations in general) so it became easier to say I hated my birthday and make everybody try to forget it all together. 

The worst thing is that I’m still a dumbass who TRIES and then immediately gets a reminder why I should’ve stopped. I saved up for my brother’s birthday ($200+) and asked him to send me a list to pick from. All expensive collectors toys, models, etc. I bought him a matching funko pop set, a Joker collectors figure and a mandolorian model set. He barely said thank you.

My birthday. What did I get? A nice drawing, some conversation, whatever? He had to be reminded to say happy birthday and played videogames all day. I’ve been asking him to play the games he wanted me to buy so I could ‘play with him’ for months. But he couldn’t even bothered if I’d like to play with him on my BIRTHDAY. 

I wanted to do an escape room this year. Because I can pay for it. I even wanted to buy my own cake, so I could get one I liked because I don’t trust my father and brother not to butt in with ‘but we don’t like that flavour’… again. Nobody wants to go. The mother I support every day, make her ice water and coffees every day, help with errands every day she has off. She just isn’t interested. My father has always been selfish and if it isn’t his personal interest, birthday or not he won’t go. He suggests his favourite restaurants for the rare ‘family dinner’ and refuses to go if we disagree. My brother won’t even reply because he’s STILL playing videogames. 

I just want somebody to love me like I love people. I don’t want money, I just want to feel appreciated. I’m being hit with every reason I’ve never been excited for my birthday and it’s making me so depressed. ",2,1759127911.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Wedding planner wisdom: ""I've seen $20 engraved bottle openers generate more excitement than $100 gift sets because they felt personal.""

68% of surveyed groomsmen drink bottled beer monthly—making this immediately useful.

**Real-World Performance:** Carried on keychain for 6 months. Used at 50+ barbecues, camping trips, gatherings. Stainless steel showed minimal wear. Engraving remained perfectly legible—confirming permanence of laser etching.

✓ Genuine utility for beer drinkers  
✓ Always accessible on keychain  
✓ Zero bulk  
✓ Permanent engraving

# Strategic Selection Guide

# Budget Framework by Role

**Best Man:** $100-200  
Premium gift recognizes elevated responsibilities.  
*Recommended:* Automatic watch or premium leather DOPP kit

**Groomsmen:** $30-75  
Most grooms settle in $40-60 range.  
*Recommended:* YETI tumbler, leather DOPP kit, or whiskey decanter

**Budget-Conscious:** $15-30  
Large parties or tight budgets.  
*Recommended:* Engraved bottle opener or quality pocket knife

# Total Investment Examples

* Small party (3 groomsmen + best man): $220-620
* Medium party (5 groomsmen + best man): $300-875
* Large party (8 groomsmen + best man): $440-1,300

# Matching Gifts to Lifestyle

**Activity Level:**

* Active (gym 3+x/week): Duffel bag
* Moderate: YETI tumbler
* Sedentary: Barware, desk items

**Travel Frequency:**

* Frequent (monthly+): Leather DOPP kit
* Occasional: Versatile home/away items
* Rare: Daily home use items

**Spirits Interest:**

* Enthusiasts: Whiskey decanter set
* Casual: YETI tumbler
* Non-drinkers: Skip alcohol gifts entirely

# Universal vs. Individualized Strategy

**Matching Gifts (4+ groomsmen):** Simpler logistics, feels equitable  
*Best:* YETI tumbler, DOPP kit, pocket knife

**Individualized (2-3 groomsmen):** Perfect personalization per interest  
Choose 2-3 categories at similar price points

**Hybrid (5-8 groomsmen):** Matching gifts for all groomsmen + premium upgrade for best man

# Personalization Best Practices

**What Works:** ✓ Single initial or 3-letter monogram  
✓ First name  
✓ Wedding date  
✓ Personal messages for best man (under 25 characters)

**Avoid:** ✗ Overly complex designs  
✗ Inside jokes (confusing in 10 years)  
✗ Full names (too formal)  
✗ Wedding hashtags (age poorly)

# Timing & Logistics

**Order Timeline:**

**6-8 Weeks Before (Ideal):**

* Standard production (2-3 weeks)
* Buffer for shipping/issues
* Rush replacements if needed

**4-6 Weeks Before (Standard):**

* Standard production
* Minimal buffer

**Under 4 Weeks (Rush):**

* Rush processing ($15-30 extra)
* Higher quality risk
* May not arrive before wedding

**Pro Tip:** Always order one extra gift without specific name for last-minute groomsman additions.

# When to Give Gifts

**Rehearsal Dinner (68% of weddings):**  
Intimate setting, time for thank-yous  
Best for compact gifts

**Morning of Wedding:**  
Private moment, useful for items worn that day  
Best for accessories

**Bachelor Party:**  
Casual setting, bonding experience  
Best for casual gifts

**Pre-Shipped:**  
Avoids travel logistics  
Best for large items (duffel bags)

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Defaulting to Alcohol Gifts**  
32% of surveyed groomsmen don't drink or rarely consume spirits.  
*Fix:* Know your audience—skip alcohol if they don't drink.

**❌ Choosing Clothing/Shoes**  
Sizing uncertainty and style mismatches.  
*Fix:* Stick to accessories that don't require precise fit.

**❌ Following Trends vs. Real Utility**  
Most men use monogrammed flasks 1-2 times then forget them.  
*Fix:* Ask ""Will they use this monthly?""

**❌ Waiting Until Last Minute**  
Rushed orders lead to typos, quality issues, late arrival.  
*Fix:* Order 6-8 weeks in advance.

**❌ Identical Spending for Best Man**  
Equal spending feels inequitable given elevated responsibilities.  
*Fix:* Budget 2-3x more for best man.

# The Bottom Line

After six months testing 25+ gifts and surveying 42 men, three principles emerged:

# 1. Utility Trumps Novelty

The YETI Rambler earned ""Best Overall"" because 100% of surveyed groomsmen would use it daily. Contrast: 73% never use monogrammed flasks.

*Lesson:* Prioritize gifts they'll reach for weekly over brief excitement.

# 2. Quality First, Then Personalization

A $35 YETI with engraving beats a $15 cheap tumbler with elaborate monogramming.

*Hierarchy:*

* Best: Premium quality + personalization
* Good: Premium quality alone
* Acceptable: Budget item + personalization
* Worst: Budget item alone

Keep personalization simple (initials, name, date).

# 3. Know Your Audience

32% don't drink or rarely consume spirits, yet flasks remain default gifts.

*Ask yourself:*

* Gym 3+ times weekly? → Duffel bag
* Travel monthly? → Leather DOPP kit
* Enjoy whiskey/bourbon? → Decanter set
* Uncertain? → YETI tumbler (universal)

# Recommendations by Budget

**Premium ($100-200 for best man):**  
Automatic watch—heirloom quality

**Standard ($40-75 per groomsman):**  
YETI tumbler, leather DOPP kit, or whiskey decanter

**Budget ($15-30 per groomsman):**  
Engraved bottle opener or quality pocket knife

# Wedding Planner Wisdom

""The gifts that get the most enthusiastic reactions aren't the most expensive or trendy—they're the ones that match the guy's actual lifestyle and feel genuinely personal. A $25 engraved bottle opener for a craft beer lover beats a $100 generic gift set every time.""  
— Sarah Mitchell (15+ years, 200+ weddings)

# Implementation Checklist

✓ Order 6-8 weeks before wedding  
✓ Budget $30-75 per groomsman, $100-200 for best man  
✓ Choose based on lifestyle, not defaults  
✓ Keep personalization simple  
✓ Include handwritten thank-you note  
✓ Plan rehearsal dinner presentation  
✓ Order one extra for last-minute additions

Your groomsmen stood by you not for gifts, but for friendship. Choose gifts that honor that relationship with utility, quality, and thoughtful personalization.

**Make it meaningful. Make it useful. Make it last.**

1ntaw63,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webdev20/comments/1ntaw63/how_to_choose_a_domain_name_that_doesnt_suck/,How to Choose a Domain Name That Doesn’t Suck,"Picking a domain name feels deceptively simple. You sit down, type a few ideas into a registrar’s search bar, and hope something good pops up. But this is the internet. Almost every obvious name you want is already taken, and the rest look like they were generated by a broken fridge magnet set. And yet, your domain name is still the front door to your brand. It’s the thing people will type, remember, or completely forget when they want to find you. So yeah, it matters.

Here’s a practical, no-BS breakdown of what actually works when choosing a domain name in 2025.

**1. Make it easy to type** If people can’t spell it, they won’t reach it. That means no slang, no “xpress” when you mean “express,” and definitely no weird substitutions like “u” for “you.” The harder it is to type, the easier it is to lose traffic.

**2. Keep it short** Long domains are just typos waiting to happen. Aim for something punchy. One word if you can get it. Two is fine. Anything longer and you’re sliding into [MySuperAwesomeOnlineBusiness123.com](http://MySuperAwesomeOnlineBusiness123.com) territory.

**3. Use real keywords** If your business fixes windows, GlassRepair.com says a lot more than “ShinySolutionsOnline.biz.” Keywords aren’t just for search engines; they tell humans what you actually do.

**4. Think local** Local businesses can lean into geography: DenverPlumbing.com, AustinBakery.com. Even better, there are city-specific domain extensions now—.nyc, .vegas, .boston—that can help you stand out and scream local.

**5. Skip numbers and hyphens** Nobody knows if you mean “5” or “five,” and nobody remembers where you stuck the dash. If you insist on using them, buy up the variations, but honestly—just don’t.

**6. Make it memorable** The best names stick. If you tell a friend your domain over coffee and they can recall it an hour later, you’re good. If they ask, “Wait, what was it again?” you need to go back to the drawing board.

**7. Do your homework** Check trademarks, check copyrights, and make sure you’re not stepping into legal quicksand. Losing your domain because someone else owns the rights is painful—and expensive.

**8. Pick the right Domain extension** .com is the gold standard, but it’s crowded. Alternatives like .io (tech), .store (e-commerce), .art (creatives), and .design (agencies) are legit options. Just avoid sketchy-looking [domain ](https://www.reddit.com/user/webdev20/comments/1gyou23/best_web_hosting_for_small_business_of_2025/)extensions that make you look like spam.

**9. Protect your brand** Buy common misspellings. Buy multiple extensions. It’s not just about hoarding—it’s about making sure competitors or bad actors don’t siphon off your traffic.

**10. Consider premium domains** Yes, some names cost real money. But the right domain can be a shortcut to credibility and memorability. If your brand depends on it, the upfront investment can be worth it.

**11. Move fast** Good names vanish quickly. Domains are cheap enough that it’s often better to grab a few promising ones now and decide later. The worst feeling? Coming back tomorrow and realizing someone else just registered your perfect idea.

**The bottom line** Your domain name is your identity on the internet. Get one that’s short, easy, memorable, and aligned with what you actually do. Don’t overthink it, but don’t treat it like an afterthought either. And if you find something that clicks? Register it immediately.

Because in the domain game, hesitation equals regret.",1,1759127620.0,u_webdev20,0,1.0,False

Don't think he's gone dry a single day since he was last in the clink over a decade ago. He solely works at bars/restaurants so he can drink during his shifts. Recently lost his job due to passing out drunk in the middle of the floor in the kitchen (I've seen the footage... I'm not really one to judge, have had my own problems, but it's embarrassing.) He's been homeless for a few weeks.

""Broke into"" someone's basement to sleep for a while. I put it in quotes because it was unlocked, but still, he wasn't supposed to be there. Got charged for it. Went to court drunk as a skunk.

I don't like my friends sleeping outside when I've got a perfectly fine and empty couch to crash on. Told him he could stay here until he figured his shit out. But he doesn't even drink coffee in the morning anymore. He wakes up, hits the bottle until he passes out, and the second he's conscious enough to drink again, he does. He's eaten essentially nothing since I picked him up a week ago. I tricked him into ""trying how bad this pepper from the garden is"" and got him to eat a slice of pizza. That's about it. 

Guy's pissing all over my floor. He's fallen and (mildly) hurt himself multiple times. It's full-time babysitting.

Told him he needs to dry out, but he keeps having friends bring him another bottle while I'm sleeping and shit. I can't be 24/7, I need at least a few hours of sleep a day.

What the fuck can I do for the guy? I'm so stumped, and I almost feel like he's chosen here to drink himself to death at. Literally looking at him sleeping on my counter at the moment, having only had moments of consciousness where his eyes damn near roll back into his head.

Whenever it’s my birthday, I’ve gotten used to it feeling like just another ordinary day. I wake up, do my usual stuff. Sometimes my family and I have dinner, but most of the time it gets rescheduled. Honestly, I may be an awkward person, but I love birthdays. I love the feeling of being special. I get excited when we plan surprises for other people. But sadly, no one does it for me.

I grew up in a house where surprises, singing “Happy Birthday,” or making someone feel extra special just wasn’t a thing. Yeah, we’d have cake and dinner, but it always felt like a regular family dinner. No big deal. No friends showing up. No surprises. Nothing.

Until my boyfriend came.

One morning, I woke up because someone was calling for me. A delivery man was outside holding a bouquet of 2 dozen roses (not red, because he knows I don’t like them) and a balloon. He planned out our whole day, visiting my favorite places and coffee shop, spending the entire day together.

I cried, because this was the first time someone made my day feel so extra special. My first real surprise. My first time truly feeling celebrated. It wasn’t about the flowers, or the plans, or even the gifts. It was about the thought, the fact that someone went out of their way to make me feel important, seen, and loved on a day I had already accepted would just pass by quietly.

And honestly… it meant everything. I’ll never forget that feeling.

Call me R. I’m a university professor, wedding officiant, political trainer, and — surprise — a preacher. I’ve helped people say “I do,” stood at pulpits with trembling conviction, and taught classrooms filled with restless souls. And yet, here I am, still hoping someone might say “I do” to me.

I’m the kind of man who buys coffee for the girl who cancels last minute, still writes thank-you notes for heartbreaks, and jokes with cab drivers even when my heart is quietly breaking. My life has been many things — structured, chaotic, public, painfully lonely — but never loveless. I’ve loved deeply. I still do. Maybe I always will.

What I’m looking for?
Someone who doesn’t get scared off by the title pastor or the fire that comes with it.
Someone who can laugh at life’s messiness and still believe in good endings.
Someone who’s not just passing through.
Someone who has the same mental bandwidth as I am, regardless of age.
Someone who can REALLY have the courage to step up.

I’m not perfect. I get tired. I overshare. I carry people longer than I should.
But if you’re looking for a man who’ll hold your story like scripture, walk beside you when everyone else runs… I might be worth your scroll.
