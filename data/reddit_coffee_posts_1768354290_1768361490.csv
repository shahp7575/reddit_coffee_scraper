Im just struggling and cant talk to anyone i know about it and i need advice from strangers. Sorry if this post is unorganized, long or if i have misspelled words i suck at spelling.

So ive always known or thought i had mental problems.. i have lots of early childhood trauma and etc (it started around 3 or 4) im not sensitive about it and barely remember like anything before i was 10, but i notice that whenever i bring it up causally people get uncomfy and walk on eggshells around me after they know. Its not that i dont like that i just dont what people to feel sorry for me when i barely remember anything and i have no problems talking about my trauma but because of people's reactions i just dont talk about it unless asked (which rarely happens).

The main reason this is important is because with early trauma such as mine and the nature of mine (i want go into detail because i dont want to trigger or upset anyone) but i will say it involves grooming of a sexual nature at the age of 3 or 4 and again when i was more grown, and an abusive step father at 5 to 6. There are more things but again like i said i wont go into detail (unless yall ask me to ig) but those or the main things before i can remember.

So like i was saying. With early childhood trauma its very hard to know what is trauma-learned or already there. As i dont remember like anything before the age of 10 so i dont remember how i was before. Anyways. But to my original problem... i think i have combined adhd and autism.. please dont try to educate me about the basic stuff, i have done a lot of research.

But my main problem is i dont know is its just stuff i learned through trauma or i actually have and what to even do about it if i do have it. I know i mask like my entire personality with everyone and thats why i cant ask anyone in my life about this. And my mother is an OT and sometimes works with low functioning autistic people. So since im not like them to her i must not be autistic (btw my father is not in my life). And when i told her i want to get assessed for adhd she said she had adhd and diagnoses wont do anything, they will just give me pills and i just need to drink coffee and focus.

SO i dont know how to proceed because i think my adhd is starting to mess with my life more than ever and i am struggling and i just wont to get assessed and know how my brain works so i can focus and get shit done...

Does anyone have advise on this? (btw idk if this matters but im 15F)",1,1768361373.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False

Over that time he has had two women pursue him. One he casually dated, although he claims they didn’t, whilst there was no physical intimacy other than a couple of kisses, they went on dates and he met her son. She was upset when we got together (perhaps justified as he obviously hadn’t told her he wasn’t actually dating her in his mind) she was quiet rude about me to him, he was confused about this as he didn’t understand why she would be like that as a friend. I told him she obviously thought more of their relationship. He insisted that they were just friends and that he felt let down by her as she had been very kind to him when his mother passed away not long after they met. They continued interacting, mostly through sending reels via social media she continued saying subtly veiled nasty things about me which I said was disrespectful and that he should tell her to stop and tell her he was in a relationship. A few months later she contacted him as they had previously had plans to go interstate for a weekend to see a concert together and I told him that wasn’t an option, which he agreed with. She kept reiterating to him that she couldn’t wait to spend the weekend with him. This made me incredibly frustrated, he thought I shouldn’t be angry at him for what she was doing and that they were just friends  but I was frustrated at him for not putting a firmer boundary in place. It turned into a very big argument and he ended up telling her not to contact him again. At the same time there was another person pursuing him, they would occasionally see each other for a drink or a coffee, prior to me he used to spend a lot of time at her house and would go to a lot of music gigs with her. Again when she found out about me she was put out, she would ask him why he was dating someone who had what she referred to as “baggage” (meaning my son) would send him inappropriate messages and would proposition him sexually. She would comment negatively on me if he ever posted anything on social media about me. Again he said that I should just trust him and that he hadn’t done anything, she was his good friend (they had known each other for about 6 months by the time I met him). If we ever had disagreements she would say I was toxic for trying to “push his friends away” and he would accuse me of that too. About a month ago after we had, had another big disagreement about these two people, he ended up at her house, and I found out that they were in bed (he maintains ON the bed as a distinction) cuddling - he says it’s because they were just feeling sad and he needed to feel better, he says he was “thinking about me” and that it “didn’t mean anything it was just a cuddle”. He says that she ended up propositioning her and he got up and left. When she found out we were back together she sent him another disparaging message about me and he replied saying that it wasn’t fair of her to just treat him like some available thing and that she was supposed to be his good friend. Recently he’s been expressing to me a lot of discomfort about me having “made people go away” I never did this, all I ever asked for was boundaries and said that they were showing both me and him a level of disrespect that made me uncomfortable. He keeps bringing the topic up, if we ever disagree about anything, he brings it up and says I made him send friends away and that I’m controlling. I am very aware that I should likely just leave and leave him to it. What keeps me staying is that anything else we disagree about is normal and mundane, arguments are caused by the issues around these two people. I’ve said to him that he chose to completely cut them off, I never asked for that and that it’s not controlling to have expectations around boundaries that protect a relationship.

It never feels like there's enough people for the number of tasks that need to be done, sometimes I'm expected to be on front, and make my own drinks and my own warming plus mobile's and brew coffee every 10 minutes... it's just so overwhelming. And then I had to sit through a 3h meeting where I'm told I have to take time to chat with customers and write meaningful personal messages on their cups?? Wtf.

I'm also getting very tired of being talked down to every day by rude customers. Had an old man mock me for the way I pronounce a word (English is not my first language but I've been speaking it since 7 years old and nobody else has trouble understanding me), had people get mad because I almost missed their 10 cent personal cup discount... everyday there's someone to ruin my mood.

And lastly, when I interviewed I told the manager while I'm available all day, I'm only willing to do shifts of 4-5h maximum because I have a bad back and neck and long hours standing give me major back pain and migraines. She had agreed to this, and followed through for the first month, but now every week I have at least one or two 8h shifts that are destroying me. Both my physical and mental health have tanked since starting this job and I don't think I can do it much longer.

I have in the past had anaphylaxis resulting in hospitalization from water. The past few months I have noticed that water feels (moderatly) ""spicy"" . Obviously you cannot cut out water but I made the switch to Spring Water and it was monumental. My flushing was almost entirely gone and if it was there I did not notice it and it would not hurt or bother me. I can also now tolerate leftovers consumed within 24 hours which is INCREDIBLE progress for someone who is low income like me. I am also able to break my weight barrier and can finally start to lose more weight thank gd. 

  
Now I have a question...

This relates to coffee

I have heard that coffee can contain mold of some sort.

For example, I can tolerate carrots as is but not fermented. and water spring but not purified.

So for coffee, I switched to decaf...with what I had said above, would ditching coffee all together potentially improve my symptoms? 

  
I am currently on my period and that used to be a big MCAS trigger and it has been much less of one with the switch to spring water

1qccbvc,https://v.redd.it/t52wout9g8dg1,Is the Era of Physical Monitors Over?,"I’ve been spending way too much time lately thinking about my physical desk setup, and honestly, I’m starting to feel like my triple-monitor rig is becoming a relic of the past.

I was testing some new spatial computing workflows this morning, and it hit me: **We are witnessing the slow death of the ""rectangle"" as our primary way of interacting with data.** For decades, we’ve been confined to these glowing glass boxes—whether it’s a phone, a tablet, or a monitor. But after spending a few hours working with windows pinned to my actual physical walls and having a 3D model of a project sitting on my coffee table, coming back to a flat screen felt... claustrophobic.

# Here is what’s messing with my head:

* **The ""Weight"" of Reality:** I love the idea of an infinite canvas, but I’ll be the first to admit that wearing a ""computer"" on my face for four hours straight still feels like a chore. The tech is getting lighter, but the friction is still there.
* **Privacy vs. Presence:** In my spatial office, I feel more ""present"" in my work, but I also realize that the device is mapping every inch of my private room to make that happen. It’s a trade-off I’m still trying to process.
* **The Social Cost:** My wife walked into the room while I was deep in a ""spatial"" focus session. To her, I was just a guy staring blankly into space in a silent room. That disconnect is weird, right?

I’m genuinely curious about where you guys stand on this. I personally think we’re about two hardware iterations away from physical monitors becoming ""legacy tech"" for anyone who doesn't do high-end color grading.

**Do you think we’re actually ready to ditch our physical screens for good, or is the ""comfort"" of a traditional monitor something we’ll never truly give up?** I’d love to hear if anyone else has tried a ""monitor-less"" week and how it actually went for your productivity (or your sanity).",1,1768360755.0,MetaversePlanet2,0,1.0,False

2. Primo: lamb ravioli in lamb broth with citrus, fresh bread, salted Italian butter

3. Main: venison with dolceforte and blackberries and a grilled vegetable skewer

4. Dessert: chocolate hazelnut tourbillon

5. Another gift: vanilla gelato with sour cherries

A bit of a late post - I visited back in November. This was my first Michelin-starred restaurant and my first time in Italy, so I do not have much experience to compare this to but I quite enjoyed it.

I arrived a few minutes late (couldn't get a taxi) but they were very gracious. I arrived at 7:15 and the restaurant was mostly empty, but it filled up as the evening went on (I understand Italians tend to eat late). The staff was friendly and attentive, and my waitress spoke excellent English. The other staff spoke good English but were a bit more reserved, but not cold.

I ordered a la carte, in part to keep the cost down, but I wasn't made to feel at all odd or unwelcome for that.

I dined in the front dining room - there was another, larger dining room in the back and I think a third downstairs. It was a little bit dark. There were some paintings on the walls but overall it felt comfortable but nothing too out of the ordinary.

The food:

The amuse-bouche was a nice surprise. The Mozzarella was very delicate and milky. The pork belly had a good flavor. The other bites had a nice texture.

The ravioli was my favorite part of the meal. The citrus balanced against the meaty flavor of the broth very well. The butter was also excellent - maybe the best I've ever had. Bread was good but nothing to write home about.

The venison was maybe the weakest part of the meal, but still quite good. The cook was great and the dolceforte was good. I do question the use of blackberries - there were only three and they were tiny (at least compared to the blackberries I'm used to in the US). It was about 6 bites of meat, so you're couldn't get a piece of fruit in each bite, and even if you did have a whole blackberry with a bite of meat you couldn't taste it. The vegetable skewer was also good and the smokiness complemented the dolceforte very well. 

Tourbillon was also very good, crunchy and the hazelnut came through. 

The gelato was another surprise and also very good, probably the best I had on the trip. 

I didn't take a picture, but their espresso was good enough to convert me to an espresso drinker (I've never been a fan of coffee).

Overall I would go back. I left feeling full but not stuffed. The main negative that stood out to me was that it was a bit loud - I could hear sirens going by every couple of minutes the entire time I was there. Besides that it was a very positive experience.",15,1768360540.0,finedining,1,1.0,False

**What Makes Winter Hard on Tiny Noses?**

* The Dry Air

Cold air simply can’t hold onto moisture as warmer air does. When the heater runs nonstop, it makes the indoor air even drier. This can turn the normal mucus in their nose into thick, sticky goo that’s hard to clear out.

* The “Coffee Stir Stick” Dilemma

Adults have larger airways, but babies’ airways are more like tiny coffee stirrers. Even a little swelling or a small amount of mucus can make them feel like they’re gasping for air, especially at night or while feeding.

**A Simple Routine to Ease Winter Sniffles**

Step 1: Add Moisture

Consider using a cool-mist humidifier; a cheap humidity meter can help you maintain levels between 30-50%.

Step 2: Clear It Out

After the saline has sat for a minute, using suction is much more effective. If you're using [Grownsy SniffEase Nasal Aspirator](https://grownsy.com/products/adjustable-suction-nasal-aspirator-with-3-soft-tips?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=sns&utm_campaign=NasalAspirator_260114), try this simple method: start at the lowest suction level and only increase if necessary (there are three levels). Plus, the light and music features can help keep your baby calm for those essential 30 seconds, making it a lot less messy to manage.

In October, I bought an 1886 Queen Anne in my hometown because I missed my family and had had enough of big city life. Then, on Sunday, my aunt brought over the four granddaughters of the former owners (she's friends with them). They spent more than two hours walking through the house with me, telling stories about growing up here, and it was magical.

I’ve always lived in old houses, but I’d never had a connection to the people who lived in one before. Now I do, and the house will never feel the same.

Their grandparents lived here from 1947–1978, then one of their sons (uncle to the sisters) lived here until 1998, renting it out before selling in 2000. This is a family with deep emotional ties to the homes connected to their loved ones. When their father died, they kept his house for almost five years and would go there after church to make lunch, just to feel close to him. 

My house is no different. A few weeks ago, one sister drove by, saw my big Christmas tree in the front window along with the icicle lights on the front porch, started crying, took a photo, and texted her sister: “Finally, someone lives in the house who loves it.” (She’s correct, btw.)

The house has been through a lot in the past 25 years—severe tornado damage that nearly led to demolition, renters (ugh), an owner with severely questionable taste, and a flipper (ugh).

After this weekend’s visit, so many quirks suddenly made sense. The angled ceiling under the coat closet? Their grandfather removed the servants’ stairs and that was the underside of the staircase. The sidewalk that disappears under the garage? It used to lead to their grandmother’s vegetable garden. The oddly shaped first-floor bathroom? A last-minute addition when she could no longer climb the stairs and turned a parlor into her bedroom.

They described the original flowery Victorian wallpaper that covered the walls—and even the ceilings. They told me where the furniture sat. One sister sewed her wedding dress and bridesmaids’ dresses in what’s now my living room. Their uncle played Christmas carols the accordion by the light of the Christmas tree and set of glass light-up deer in the front parlor. They bathed in a metal tub in the kitchen as kids. Their grandmother made donuts every morning, and the town’s police officers and factory workers would stop by for coffee and donuts, parking on the side lawn because there was no driveway and no curb.

They even brought me banana bread made from their grandmother’s recipe.

It was magical...nostalgic for them and informative for me. And now, I don’t just live in this house...I feel connected to it.",29,1768360500.0,centuryhomes,3,1.0,False

Like I said the coffee itself was awesome, but the overall experience was soured when I heard a man, who I presume is the manager, verbally shunned one of the employees VERY loudly while I was in the cafe, almost as if to shame them in front of me on purpose. Personally, I believe in the idea of praising in public, correct in private, and trying to shame/embarrass an employee (seemingly on purpose) is not a good business practice. I’m hoping the owners are made aware of this behaviour, as it should be corrected. It’s very sad to see a young employee shunned for simply trying, and my experience here has been overall ruined. I will not be returning to this location, despite the good coffee, cause I cannot support a place where this is seemingly common practice. I just wanted to share.

1qcc658,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_macebooks/comments/1qcc658/oneonone_meetings_the_30minute_weekly_practice/,One-on-One Meetings: The 30-Minute Weekly Practice That Improves Retention by 8%,"A one-on-one meeting is a recurring conversation between a manager and their direct report, typically lasting 30 minutes and held weekly. Its purpose is to build trust, surface issues early, provide feedback, and support the employee's growth and performance.

Done well, one-on-ones are among the highest-leverage activities a manager can do. Done poorly or skipped entirely they create disconnection, missed problems, and higher turnover.

# Why One-on-Ones Matter: What the Research Shows

The case for regular one-on-ones isn't based on management theory. It's based on measured outcomes across thousands of managers and employees.

**On engagement:** Gallup research found that employees who have regular one-on-one meetings with their manager are almost three times as likely to be engaged compared to those who don't. Separately, 86% of companies with highly engaged workforces hold one-on-ones regularly, compared to only 50% of disengaged organizations.

**On retention and results:** Manager Tools studied over 175,000 managers and found that weekly one-on-ones improved both results and retention by an average of 8%. Biweekly meetings showed only about 3% improvement. Monthly meetings actually *decreased* results and retention compared to no structured meetings at all.

**On manager effectiveness:** Google's Project Oxygen research identified that managers who hold frequent one-on-ones with their team consistently score higher in performance evaluations than those who don't.

**On employee experience:** Research from O.C. Tanner found that employees who have weekly or biweekly one-on-ones are 157% more likely to believe their manager understands the realities of their day-to-day work. MIT Sloan research showed that employees with weekly one-on-ones reported feeling 20% less anxious about these meetings and 12% more successful in their jobs compared to those meeting less frequently.

The pattern is consistent: regular, well-run one-on-ones correlate with better engagement, better retention, and better performance. Infrequent or poorly run meetings often make things worse.

# The Core Principles

Before the tactics, understand what makes one-on-ones work:

**It's their meeting, not yours.** The employee should drive the agenda. This is their dedicated time to raise concerns, ask questions, get feedback, and discuss their development. Your job is to listen, ask good questions, and help them get what they need.

**Consistency matters more than perfection.** A reliable 30-minute weekly meeting beats an occasional hour-long conversation. Predictability builds trust. Canceling or constantly rescheduling signals that the employee isn't a priority.

**It's not a status update.** Project updates can happen in email, Slack, or team meetings. One-on-ones are for the things that don't fit in those formats: challenges, frustrations, ideas, career goals, feedback, and relationship-building.

**Trust compounds over time.** The first few one-on-ones may feel awkward or surface-level. That's normal. Real openness develops after employees see that you follow through, keep confidences, and genuinely care about their success.

# How to Structure a One-on-One

The Manager Tools method, validated across hundreds of thousands of managers, uses a simple 30-minute structure:

**First 10 minutes: Their agenda.** The employee talks about whatever is on their mind. This could be a problem they're facing, a question about priorities, something they're proud of, or something bothering them. Your job is to listen, ask follow-up questions, and understand.

**Second 10 minutes: Your agenda.** Share information they need, provide feedback, discuss upcoming changes, or raise concerns you've observed. Keep this focused—if you dominate the meeting, it stops being valuable for them.

**Final 10 minutes: Development.** Discuss their goals, career trajectory, skills they want to build, or growth opportunities. This doesn't need to happen every meeting, but it should happen regularly.

This isn't the only structure that works. Some managers prefer different formats. But the principle holds: the employee's needs come first, followed by the manager's needs, with ongoing attention to development.

# Practical Guidance

# Frequency: Weekly is the Standard

Research consistently points to weekly meetings as most effective. If weekly isn't feasible perhaps you manage a large team, biweekly is the next best option. Monthly meetings don't work; by the time you meet, issues have festered and the connection has weakened.

For a team of five or fewer, weekly 30-minute one-on-ones are manageable (2.5 hours per week). For larger teams, consider 30 minutes biweekly, or adjust duration based on role complexity.

# Duration: 30 Minutes is Usually Right

Thirty minutes is long enough to cover meaningful topics but short enough to stay focused. Some employees especially those in complex roles or who manage others may benefit from 45-60 minutes. But start with 30 and adjust based on need.

Shorter meetings (15-20 minutes) tend to stay surface-level. Longer meetings (60+ minutes) often lose focus unless there's specific reason.

# Scheduling: Protect the Time

Schedule one-on-ones as recurring meetings. Let employees choose from available time slots when possible this small act of control increases their investment.

Treat the meeting as nearly inviolable. Rescheduling occasionally is fine; repeatedly canceling or deprioritizing sends a clear message that the employee doesn't matter.

Avoid scheduling one-on-ones right before or after high-stress events (performance reviews, major presentations) unless you're specifically discussing those events.

# Location: Create Comfort

The goal is a setting where the employee feels comfortable speaking openly. A private office or conference room works. Some managers take occasional one-on-ones outside—walking meetings or coffee shops which can feel less formal and encourage more open conversation.

For remote teams, video is better than phone. Nonverbal cues matter for building connection and reading how someone is actually doing.

# Preparation: Come Ready

**For managers:** Review notes from the last meeting. Check on any action items you committed to. Think about feedback you want to share or topics you need to raise. Know what's happening with this person's work.

**For employees:** Set the expectation that they drive the agenda. Some managers ask employees to send agenda items in advance; others keep it informal. Either works—what matters is that the employee comes with something to discuss.

# During the Meeting: Listen More Than Talk

The biggest mistake managers make is talking too much. This is the employee's meeting. Ask open-ended questions (starting with ""what"" and ""how""), then listen to the full answer before responding.

Take notes—what your people say matters enough to write down. Note their concerns, commitments you make, and action items for both of you. Review these notes before the next meeting.

Avoid the trap of immediately solving every problem raised. Sometimes employees need to vent or think through something out loud. Ask ""Do you want me to help solve this, or do you just need to talk it through?"" before jumping to solutions.

# After the Meeting: Follow Through

If you committed to do something, do it. Nothing destroys one-on-one effectiveness faster than a manager who says ""I'll look into that"" and never does. Your follow-through teaches employees whether these meetings are worth their investment.

Keep a simple record of what was discussed and any action items. This doesn't need to be elaborate—a few bullet points work. The record helps you track patterns over time and ensures nothing falls through the cracks.

# Questions That Work

Good questions open up meaningful conversation. Poor questions get one-word answers.

**On their work:**

* What's taking up most of your time right now?
* What's the biggest obstacle you're facing?
* What would make your work easier this week?
* Is there anything you're stuck on that I could help with?

**On your relationship and their support:**

* How can I better support you?
* Is there anything I'm doing that's getting in your way?
* Do you feel like you're getting enough feedback from me?
* What's something you wish I understood better about your work?

**On their development:**

* What skills do you want to build this year?
* Where do you see yourself in two years?
* What part of your job do you enjoy most? Least?
* What would help you grow in your role?

**On the team and organization:**

* Is there anything happening on the team I should know about?
* How are things going with \[specific colleague or project\]?
* What's one thing we could do differently as a team?

Avoid questions that sound like interrogation or that you could answer yourself by checking their work. The point is to learn what you can't see from the outside.

# Common Mistakes

**Treating it as a status meeting.** If you spend the whole time on project updates, you've missed the point. Status updates can happen asynchronously.

**Doing all the talking.** If you leave a one-on-one having talked 70% of the time, something went wrong. Aim for the employee to talk at least half the time, ideally more.

**Canceling repeatedly.** Every cancellation signals priorities. Occasional rescheduling is fine. Patterns of cancellation tell employees they're not important.

**Avoiding difficult topics.** One-on-ones are the right place for difficult conversations—concerns about performance, behavior feedback, or tough organizational news. Avoiding these topics doesn't make them go away.

**Not following through.** If you say you'll do something, do it. Broken commitments accumulate into broken trust.

**Making it about you.** Venting to your direct report about your problems isn't appropriate for this meeting. They have their own concerns.

**Skipping development.** It's easy to fill every meeting with immediate work concerns. But employees also need to discuss their growth, goals, and future. Make time for it.

# For Employees: Getting More From Your One-on-Ones

One-on-ones are more valuable when employees approach them actively rather than passively waiting for their manager to lead.

**Come prepared.** Have at least one or two things you want to discuss. Don't wait for your manager to pull topics out of you.

**Raise important issues early.** Don't drop a significant concern in the last two minutes. If something matters, bring it up with enough time to discuss it properly.

**Be honest.** Your manager can only help with problems they know about. The meeting is private—use it to share what you might not say in a group setting.

**Ask for what you need.** If you need more feedback, clearer priorities, different types of work, or help with a colleague, say so. Managers aren't mind-readers.

**Give feedback upward.** If your manager does something that helps you, tell them. If they do something that makes your job harder, tell them that too. Good managers want to know.

# Adapting to Context

One-on-ones aren't one-size-fits-all. The approach should flex based on the employee and situation.

**For new employees:** Meet more frequently early on (possibly twice weekly) and focus on onboarding questions, clarity about expectations, and building the relationship. As they get established, move to standard weekly meetings.

**For experienced, autonomous employees:** The meeting can be shorter or less structured. You might focus more on development and strategic topics, less on day-to-day work.

**For employees who manage others:** Consider longer meetings (45-60 minutes) and include discussion of their team dynamics, management challenges, and leadership development.

**For remote employees:** Video is important—you lose too much without visual cues. Consider occasional in-person one-on-ones when possible, even if most are remote.

**When things are going well:** Don't skip the meeting. Use it for recognition, development focus, and maintaining the relationship. The meeting matters as much in good times as in difficult ones.

**When things are going poorly:** This is when one-on-ones matter most. Address concerns directly, provide clear feedback, and document the conversation. Difficult conversations are part of the manager's job.

# Making It Sustainable

For managers with multiple direct reports, one-on-ones can feel time-consuming. But consider the alternative: problems you don't learn about until they're crises, employees who disengage because they don't feel heard, and turnover that costs far more than the meeting time.

Some practices that help:

* Block one-on-one time together in your calendar (e.g., Tuesday afternoons for all one-on-ones) to reduce context-switching
* Keep the format simple—don't over-engineer with complex templates
* Use a simple note-taking system you'll actually maintain
* Recognize that the time you invest in one-on-ones reduces time spent on problems later

The math usually works out: managers who maintain consistent one-on-ones report fewer surprises, less firefighting, and more productive teams overall.

# Summary

Effective one-on-one meetings follow a few key principles:

* Hold them weekly, for about 30 minutes, at a consistent time
* Let the employee drive the agenda—it's their meeting
* Listen more than you talk
* Cover their concerns first, then yours, with regular attention to their development
* Take notes and follow through on commitments
* Don't cancel except when truly necessary

The research is clear: managers who hold regular, well-run one-on-ones build more engaged teams, retain more employees, and get better results. The investment is 30 minutes per week per employee. The return is a team that trusts you, communicates openly, and performs at a higher level.",1,1768360318.0,u_macebooks,0,1.0,False

I’m a male in early 30s spend most of my weekdays working in the downtown core.

I have been here a few years now. Career wise things are going well, but socially I realized i’ve been a bit too stuck in a work → home → gym loop.

I train BJJ and I’m a blue belt, though i’m currently taking about a month off because of a shoulder injury.

Even though I have a partner, but I strongly believe in having my own friends. 

Would love to connect with people in DT who are up for:
	•	Coffee or food around downtown
	•	Walks during lunch breaks or after work
	•	Low-key hangouts, good conversations, and decompressing from work/life

I’m pretty chill, easy to talk to, and not awkward (I promise 😄). Open to meeting people from any background.

And… another reason I study English is my bf, he is 33old, and I’m 21 old. He always compare me with his Xgirlfriend(same age with him). He said me ‘she can really speak English,better than you’. I was injured, from his talking. After that talk, I cried in front of him, and he said ‘it was just kidding and, I think it is just ‘true’ because she was English Instructor’.
So… I just said “okay,, I understand….”
But actually, I think I don’t understand at all. So when I study English, the statement is reminded in my brain. It’s painful but I have to do.

Whenever I bring up this matter he just tells me I’m over reacting and that he did everything he could for me to the point that I’m starting to question myself.

First of all, I’m always the one traveling to him, I study in university and I’m supposed to get my degree this summer so I’m very busy and it takes lots of effort to organize each time (+ the expenses) to meet him. He, on the other hand, is a freelancer and works from home with his laptop, making it easy to travel without having to stop working.

Another major thing that bothers me is that the best activities we’ve done together were always planned by me: hikes, concerts, sporty activities, amusement parks n other events...I’m a very adventurous person and although I love it when he brings me to the cinema, for a coffee or occasionally dinner, It‘s just always the same activities, in the same spots. We also have never went to holidays together (not even for a weekend), never did anything special for festivities like christmas or new year’s eve cause he doesn’t really care.

He also hardly ever buys me gifts, I‘ve never asked for anything pricey, I just like to b surprised w small things every now and then that make me feel like he thinks about me.

Also, during the time I go visit him we mostly stay at home and besides working and training, he spends most of the day w his laptop/watching tv/using his phone and playing video games.  I, on the other hand, love having long conversations or doing handmade activities but the few times I manage to convince him he just gets instantly bored.

I feel like his ideal relationship is simply spending time together, chilling, living the daily life without anything exciting happening and just avoiding conflict. Basically like a couple married for decades, but we’re in our 20s and just recently got together… it’s so boring! I just feel like I’m an accessory in his life,  where I’m just temporarily  filling a gap since he doesn’t do much to nurture our relationship compared to the effort he puts on himself and his job.

I‘m just so drained of my energy, I feel like on my side I’ve tried everything, I’ve tried to adapt to his lifestyle, tried lowering my standards. I’ve always communicated my needs and waited for him to change but after telling him clearly what I need so many times I just can’t help but end up arguing with him/crying for every minor issues out of built up frustration, which makes me feel so guilty and sad cause in the end it seems like he truly believes that he’s been doing his best and I feel like he does love me. After all the effort I put, he recently started talking about breaking up because of the arguments and because of him wanting to prioritize 100% his job, and I can’t help but feel used and like I’ve waisted my time. The only reason I ever complained is because I genuinely cared about us and instead of leaving him after the first red flag I wanted to help him open up and have a deeper/long lasting bond.

I am similar to Malvika a divorced single mom and let’s say earning in the same range - I also don’t have any support and am fully dependent on myself. However I have been very prudent in saving for a decade now. I don’t drink the fancy coffees, buy the designer bags or eat fancy meals out all the time (I am not saying I haven’t indulged occasionally). I have a fair estimate of what she should have saved by now and what kind of insurance back up she should have. What hurts is I’ve spent years watching these Instagram stories wondering what am I doing wrong? How come these people are buying fancy coffee machines, flexing designer bags and living this lifestyle whereas I do think of every expense.

Up until last month (I am sharing some pictures) she is still drinking fancy coffee,putting out fancy meals, flexing a fancy gym. So she chooses to live this lifestyle and when there is a rainy day, she gets to e beg from people. And she doesn’t even have the decency to stop posting her lifestyle a few days before the fund raiser. She is putting up meals she ate outside, the coffee she needs.

I don’t expect fairness from the world. But yes I am glad she is getting called out. And I do hope the necessary authorities look into what is essentially fraudulent fund raising.

This is a lesson that influencers show a lifetstyle but are running through their money like quick sand. 
 Don’t move to Dubai and act like going from a 3 bhk to 2 bhk is a compromise. What a joke!

Jack having more or less been more interested at this point in gnawing at the side of a donut he'd been given. The sounds he made trying to bite into it, more akin to the sound a canine might make working through a bowl of kibble. Even giving an off putting knock the moment the boy left it to drop atop the desk he sat. Seemed even the long bath it had been given did little to soften it's petrified exterior.

Plucking sound heard from the string that had been the boy's fishing line. Left to stare, to wait for whatever had been lurking within the murk that had been his drink. String now pulled, as the boy was left to stare upon the dripping bag that had been his bait. Left to watch it slowly spin a few times before dropping it beside the wig and bonnet left atop the desk. Mug nearly pressed against the boy's lips, to pause brief now that he stare down upon his pinkie that would slowly lift. Only now would the boy try this thing called tea.

Sip had all it would take for the boy to know the bitterness of this drink. Without warning the boy now stood, watching the man in blue now pass him by, sipping from a paper cup. Jack's own cup now placed beside the tattered, sludge covered gown he had been dressed. Left in only his muddy, wool pajamas. Left alone in the hall that lead one towards an exit. Left to stare upon the massive box that had been dangling countless treasures from hook like branches.

Reaching for the one he had wanted, only to be stopped by some unseen wall. Something that left the boy to stare, upon the spot his hand was left to  press, before staring down upon the large symbols that had been carved upon each wooden button. To press upon the one that matched the symbols carved upon the one he wanted. Just how long had this boy been left to stare down upon this pressed button with a blank expression. Only to try another, Only to be given the same answer.

Wasn't until this boy had come across the more curious thing, Etched within the side of this wall sized box, had been a picture that looked like his coin. One that had been pointing towards the narrow gap left just off to the side. Fickle was this old coin that appeared within his palm without warning. Curious had been the staring of this silver eagle. Stare broken once it had been pressed into the awaiting slot. Thunks, clunks, and all manor of sounds echoed from deep within the bowels of this great big wooden box. The boy left to stand, to follow the sounds that crawled up from the bowels of this treat filled box.

Soft had been the sound of cracking ice, cracking that now appeared out of thin air, upon the glass that appeared all the same. How Jack's eyes had been left to slowly follow these cracks that worked up along the glass, to spread, to crack, to splinter across the wooden frame. What cries this box would make, of small hook filled fingers left to slowly break, How violent had been the vomiting of it's treasures, to fill the floor with piles of rainbow colored splendor.

From one pile a single bar the boy would take. To ignore the rest of what had been ill-gotten gains. No sooner had the boy stepped away had this now empty box collapsed beneath it's own weight, to come crashing down upon the wall it would face. To gouge the very brick that would not break, the fall it made. Rush of wind felt as it slammed, To send splintering pieces every which way, Just how much force had been needed for coins to become lodged within the ceiling of this place. For one to have strayed far enough to shatter the very mug a man in blue had been holding.

Colorful as a rainbow had been the language of all those that had been left stampeding. Towards the very source of this sudden, Chaos, Destruction. Only to find a kid, caught holding his bar of candy. Kid that had been left staring blankly up at all those that had been swearing, glaring. Yet none having been directed towards this boy.

""Which one of you was suppose to be watching the kid!"" one cried, while another howled. ""Wasn't it your job!"" A finger had been left to point. ""What about him! He hasn't been doing anything productive!"" Quick had been this group to be lost amongst heated yelling, name calling. ""What a god damn mess"" heard from one that had been left staring. ""We just got that thing too"" another looked as if he was about to cry.  ""Any of you idiots check on the kid!""

Quickly had been these men in blue to kneel and squat down around the boy, to check him not once, not twice, but thrice over for any harm he might of suffered. Knew not the weight lifted once they found not so much as a scratch had been left upon this boy. ""Thank God, He's all right.""

Jack had been left to stare upon each one of their faces as they had been searching, Vacant had been his expression as he knew not why they made such strange faces. Two officers left standing over what had been left of the metal that had once been their brand new, snack machine. ""Anyone got any idea how this happened?""

Angered had been the expression of one of these over worked, and exhausted men. ""We don't got time for this, We're already behind as it is, How soon till we can get rid of this damn kid?!""

Wide had been the eyes that stared up at this angered man. Upon the tips of his toe's the boy had been left to stand, reaching up with his candy bar, one he now tried to offer, to press against this angered man's lips. Candy bar that would be left slapped away from, and out of the boy's hand. One the boy had been left to stare upon the spot it now rest.

Unaware had this man been of the one called Frank. ""My office, Now!"" Thick had been the plume of smoke that escaped the chief's lips. For how quick anger had turned to fear of the one now lead off to the office of the other. One sided had been the muffled yelling that echoed from behind closed doors.

""Come on kiddo, Let's get you back to your seat, Parents should be by to pick you up once they find a way to get through all that snow.""

Hand gently pressed upon the boy's back, leading him towards the spot he usually sat. ""Why don't you stay put, And enjoy this nice donut you have sitting there.""

Jack having been handed the donut he had been unable to break the skin of with his teeth. Left to stare upon what had not been a treat. Some point during the time the boy had been left to stare, the other officers had returned to there usual work, Ignoring the mess that had been left in the hallway floor. Abrasive had been the voice the boy soon heard.

""The hell happened here"" Detective left to stare, as sweeter smoke hit the air. Tapping the ashes of his cigar into the ashtray of his desk, the boy sat. To snuff out the very life it once had, before pocketing what had been left of the cigar he had on hand.

Whatever thought, or interest The Detective had of this mess had been brief, as it had been with the yelling that came from the office. ""Let's go kid, We've got a long night ahead of us.""

One never knew just how bright the night could be, Beneath the full moon that now shine down upon the ice that encased the town. One knew not where streets would end, and side walks would begin beneath this endless blanket of white, beneath this not so dark night. Crisp air left to sting with the slightest breeze. Crunch of snow heard beneath The Detectives long overdue, and worn out shoes. Left pulling the toboggan the boy now sat.

Wrapped in an emergency blanket, the boy would stare down at the doughnut held between the mittens that served as his hand prisons. Left to listen to the echo of every step The Detective made, The only thing one would hear upon the crisp air this night. To be drowned out after a time by the echoing of The Detective's words.

""Think we need to put a leash and collar on you kid, Anytime we take our eyes off you, We end up having to send out a search party.""

""It would really help if you weren't so tight lipped about all these messes you keep ending up in.""

""Between you, and those spooks, Can't get a strait answer out of anyone these days.""

""Though I have to hand it to you kid, you really know how to grab the spot light, With how many people have started asking around about you.""

Long had been the pause The Detective gave. ""Got anything to say for yourself kiddo?""

Answer had come in the form of an offering, one that had been the doughnut he had been left holding.

""Kid I don't know who keeps giving you those, but the only use those things have is for decoration."" Taken now from between the boy's hands, to be tossed across what might of been a street. From beneath the sea of snow a great beast would leap, To snatch this discarded treat, To land atop the snow with a mighty, belly flop.

Wide eyed had been The Detective nearly given a heart attack, as he had been reaching for his gun. More colorful then a rainbow had been the string of words that echo through out the night. Rex left to pull the sled now that The Detective needed a moment to catch his breath. One not given, as he watched the canine dart off across this endless field that had been snow.

Another sleepless night of those that had been left waiting at the boy's home. Boy now left placed before the talking box, to listen to the stories it now told. Canine laying down beside him, trying to gnaw his way through the discarded thing that seemed not even he could manage to eat.

📻 *Ho ho ho Santa here, Hope all you good boys and girls are ready for all those gifts I'm going to leave!*

Moving of chairs heard from within the kitchen, His mother had been the first one to speak, sounding as if she had still been in shock. ""I was only cleaning for a few minutes, and he was gone.""

📻 *And for all those parents out there, Just remember Super-Mart will still be open to fill all your Christmas needs, this Christmas eve!*

His Father would be the next, exhausted was his tone. ""As I already told you before Dad, The gate was closed and still locked from the outside.""

♪ *He's the little boy that Santa Clause forgot* ♪

His old man eyeing him now, before looking off into the other room the boy had been sitting. ""Feels like I've been working twice as hard during this little vacation. Really got our hands full with this one""

♪ *And goodness knows he didn't want a lot* ♪

Clicking of the Radio heard now that his mother had come to carry him off to his usual nightly scrub. Left to stare at all the stains left in his regular pajamas. One his mother had been left to scrub clean within the bath the boy now sat. Distracted by all the bubbles the boy had once more been given to pop. Bubbles left to scatter now that Rex had decided to dive into the depths of soapy waters.

Both Fathers left mopping up the bathroom floor now that his mother had been tucking him in for what was left of the night. Canine left wagging his tail from beneath the bed he lay. Eager for his new friend to come out and play. Slow had been his mother to close the door, For the moment it had, the boy had been left to listen to the slower popping of stitches.

1qcbt81,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1qcbt81/my_past_roommate_was_nuts_dont_be_like_me/,"My past roommate was nuts, don’t be like me!","Wanted to come on and tell my roommate story because Iv been free from her for months now.

Fun fact I originally posted about part of my situation on here and got called a bum… well now I don’t feel bad.

Back in the beginning of 2025 I was in a slumlord situation, ended up with mold poisoning because the landlord refused to fix a leak that caused mold all over the house. I basically got kicked out because I told the landlord that unless he fixed it I was going to turn it into a case. Lost my job that same month and was getting kicked out with no place to go and only about $400 to my name. I randomly went on my towns reddit and met a woman, 40s, who was in need of a roommate asap because her abusive ex was kicked out. We talked, she helped me move by getting a truck- let me pay off the first month in payments along with the next months rent. Over all she was extremely nice and I felt so in debt to her. 

I admit that I had two months while living with her I had slip ups, I was a week late on rent do to a bank issue and the she got pissed after I didn’t give her the last payment of $40 for that first months rent when she magically wanted it. 

I lived with here about 10 months, by the forth month she was treating me like shit. She told me that her lease was going to be up in October and she was moving with her daughter to another city. No problem, started working on getting myself options because I started a new job and had to save. 

Very quickly she started to get more and more nasty verbally. 

She became paranoid. She started to accuse me of stealing random things like light bulbs and opening her food. She got upset because I used toilet paper she left in MY bathroom from when I moved in, months after the fact. I used some of her coffee creamer which I offered to pay her back for- she blew up but then told me she actually bought me a container to be nice…turns out she laced it with stuff I was allergic too. Accused me of using her food stuff which she told me I could and then said she didn’t. 

She would corner me and cuss me out and tell me how much she hated me and never liked me and so on. That her abusive ex did more than I ever did. This would last from 20-30 minutes long multiple times a month.

After the whole almost poisoning me thing I knew I needed to get out and fast. One night I locked myself in my room and she had her friend over. The whole time I hear her talking shit about me, calling me a creep because I didn’t turn the light on in the kitchen at night ( her door was always open and I felt and so I wouldn’t turn the light on) telling her friend I was nasty because I ate my meals in my room. Because I wouldn’t come out to hang out with her (you can’t verbally harass and abuse someone and think they want to hang out with you). Find out that she lied about the lease being up and that it wasn’t going to be up until November and that she wasn’t even leaving.

My current roommate I found on facebook, helped me get a new place but sadly in the same apartment complex. My crazy ex roommate told me up and down that I would never be able to get an apartment here because of the requirements….well I did and it took less than three days. I had all my stuff out within three days- fully admit I didn’t pay that months rent because it was a few days into the month and i found out she wasn’t allowed to be renting me the room as is, I just needed a clean break. 

I had one last trip to get my stuff…she changed the locks on me. Acted paranoid over text saying “your playing a game with me and I’m not doing it” she waited another week that she wasn’t going to let me back into the apartment until I paid half the electric (she waited over a week just so the electric bill would come out) (this is where I came into Reddit’s because I didn’t know if she could legally lock me out and withhold my possessions over money- y’all are me up saying I was a bum for even questioning it) yeah well I did end up paying her…she then ghosted me for 5 days more and every day I sent her texts asking to at least put my stuff out if she wasn’t going to text me back a day and time to come pick up my items or clean. She texted back after 5 days to tell me “I know you’re trying to get out of cleaning and it won’t work your cleaning this shit up.” And “you’re not getting out of it and I have to be home because I’m not leaving you here alone” and threating to sue me if I didn’t clean…so hay if you don’t allow me back in by ghosting me with no instructions on a meet up, I can’t clean. She then sent me a picture of a bag of trash (no food just random garbage that I needed to take out since I was moving and cleaning the room before she locked me out) a picture of the rim of my toilet which was dirty, and proceeded to call me a “dirty bitch you nasty!!!” I ended up calling the police when she finally decided to give me a time and date to show up and she wanted to act like she was going to fight me the minute she opened the door but locked up when she realized I brought the cops. The room and bathroom were cleaned in less than 30 minutes and my stuff moved.

Never heard from her again.

That was until I almost ran into her a month later in the main office of our apartment building. She was trying to get someone (her daughter I believe) on the lease. I dipped before she saw me.

One day I was talking to one of the office girls who I have become really good friends with and I’m like “hey you know how I had that really bad roommate situation? Well I won’t get in trouble or the ex if I say I lived here before?” And she was like “nah I won’t say anything” and then she kinda laughed and was like “it would be some shit of if you said it was —-ex roommates name—“ and I just went wide eyed and nodded.

She then told me that apparently that same week her ex boyfriend, the “abusive” one that she kicked out, had showed up at the office to get his name taken off the lease. Turns out he was never take off the whole time I lived there for almost a year. He came in and the girl knew him form before he left, she ended up talking to him and he showed her texted and screen shots.

Apparently she was a cheater in the since that they where only together because she got him to cheat with her on HER FRIEND! Then it turned out that she wasn’t just verbally abusive to me but him as well and they had noise complaints about it, ultimately she verbally and physically abused him to the point he was thinking about taking his own life…he then found messages of hers on her phone where she was taking to people online (I guess these where the screenshots he showed the office girl) where she was telling people that she was purposefully wanting to drive him to self delete so he would do it on a special date (because apparently she thinks she’s a witch or something?) and it would clean her karmas or something… let that sink in.

A few weeks ago I started going to therapy, my therapist believes I actually developed a form of ptsd form living with this woman because of how verbal abuse and controlling she was of me because she knew I didn’t have any other option with my situation.

I don’t know what I can say, but just don’t be like me. Move out in your own if you can. If you move in with someone, at least try and get to know them for a while before moving in with them.

(I don’t need criticism on this anymore, I was very stupid and naïve during the whole situation. It is in the past and I’m in a better situation now.)",1,1768359354.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False

This was to replace a Delonghi Magnifica S, about 10 years old and prior to that had another Delonghi.  So, a switch to Jura was unexpected.... but wow, so glad I did... granted it costs much more... but you get:

1. Better tasting cup of coffee and espressos when you compare with the Delonghi 
2. Use less beans and it tastes better; the bean hopper is small but adequate
3. So damn quiet -you can make a coffee in the middle of the night and not wake up your neighbors. 
4. Easier to add ground beans w/o making a mess.

1qcboku,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qcboku/aitah_for_asking_my_dad_what_his_freaking_problem/,AITAH for asking my dad what his freaking problem is with my girlfriend,"I’ve always had a great relationship with my father but lately it feels like he’s lost his freaking mind. It all started a few weeks before Christmas he asked for me and my girlfriends wish lists which my girlfriend provided and a few days after he has a talk with me about some things on there that he was confused about asking for some more fem leaning clothes (for context i have begun transitioning and told him in October and if im going to receive clothes for Christmas as i pretty much always have i would like them to lean more feminine so i can have something to experiment with my look more) his response is that it felt like she was trying to dictate how i look i told him no i wanted a few things to expand what I had available to experiment with changing my look,

a few days later he sent a text message saying that he was uncomfortable with my girlfriends expectations for her wish list she explained that she wasn’t expecting anything specific and that she just sent a full wish list including everything from something pink to she could use a new computer. His husband responded by saying that my father has trauma around gift giving and this has stressed him out that he has often felt like he had to buy peoples love. I can see where this would come from as my mother is quite materialistic but had never heard anything like this from him as long as I lived! It was explained that there were no expectations and whatever they got would be more than enough.

Next week i have been invited to coffee with my mom as she was in town. She asked me if I could come alone as she wanted some 1 on 1 time. When I got there I found both her and my dad waiting for me what followed was alot of questions about my transition i feel they could have asked me in private alot along the lines of why did you decide to transition medically before socially, have you thought about how this would impact your fertility, and have you considered violence in that your going from the most privileged group into the group with the highest likelihood of being targeted for a hate crime . (a line of questioning I largely consider to be of the same calibre as have you tried NOT being gay and … are you sure?) in addition to this he brings up my girlfriend again in her role on the night i came out, she encouraged me and gently nudged me into the position of come out and my dad considered this to be pressuring me to come out i explained to him that I needed a nudge because I have a tendency to just not address bigger things and dance around things (he brought this up on the night and I explained to him he brought it up again a week later and now it’s being brought up and explained again a third time) on top of the wish list incident he said that it seemed like i was “her little pet project” which I found incredibly insulting to both me and her

on top of this on another occasion she had been talking to my grandmother and my grandmother asking how I was doing and my girlfriend replied that i had been struggling a little bit with my mental health due to stress and according to my dad this stressed her out so much that she was apparently sobbing asking him to check in on me but when I talked to her directly she responded that she worries a bit but she wasn’t pulling her hair out or anything and seemed chill about everything and was confused about what my dad had said I don’t fully believe either of them 100% but I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle here

After this i called him a day after “coffee and talking ” and said straight up asking “what is the bug up your butt about my girlfriend?” “It feels like you are willing to at the drop of a hat assume the worst of her” this isn’t limited to just these incidents i feel like it’s been a consistent pattern of behaviour over the years and i feel it’s unfair to someone i love i feel he’s being uncharitable to her and after all these years she should have earned some benefit of the doubt. (Especially because if i were to be equally uncharitable i could easily say it looks like his husband is attempting to stir up drama in an effort to isolate him from the family) he got incredibly upset at this and I did not show up to the yuel dinner they were hosting. The intent was if this is intentional then you need to cut the shit and if it isn’t you need to do some soul searching and find what place emotionally this is coming from

I didn’t see or speak to them until Christmas where they effectively club snubbed us (not starting anything but very noticeably actively not interacting) including the end of the night where we were waiting alone and he continued more or less ignoring me

I sent them a thank you text after Christmas for their thoughtful gift and no response. I sent a new years message no response… four days later I get the response that their basically going no contact with us “i am stepping away and will not be communicating with you at this time i need space” and my stepdad writing “i too am stepping away and i no longer want to be referred to as dad” this is a big deal because when he got married to my dad there was a big fight between him and my sibling about them not wanting to call him dad for context my sibling has trauma due to our first step father abandoning us

So from my perspective it’s hard not to feel like this is possibly some kind of unconscious transphobia on my dad’s part and he’s projecting it onto my girlfriend especially with what he said during that talk

Aitah? Im wondering if I was too harsh when I confronted him about his attitude but how else should I act when I feel someone i love is being treated unfairly. Or he could be upset at me talking directly with my grandmother about what he said about her being stressed During “coffee” he and my mother told me that I should be treating my grandparents “like toddlers” and try to not confuse them or add to their stress while they’re “on their way out “ which feels disrespectful and unkind to me so maybe by talking to her directly he saw that as me disregarding his wishes?

I stride through city alleys, heart ablaze,
A rebel poet scripting dreams in midnight haze.
Chaos King, my words ignite the silent night,
Each line a spark, each sentence burning bright.

In vinyl glow and coffee’s warming steam,
I chase the pulse of life, I hunt the dream.
Author’s hand and camera’s watchful eye,
I capture truth where fleeting moments lie.

Yet tender beats beneath my leather skin,
A longing to be seen, a flame lit deep within.
I carry a found-friendship in laughter’s rome,
Where solitude dissolves, and every soul finds home.
Chaos King, I stand—both storm and calm,
A lover’s touch, a poet’s psalm.

I write my legend—pain and hope, and boundless bliss.",1,1768358657.0,u_No-Appearance602,0,1.0,False

Here's what I learned:

**General life tips:**

1. Choose a coach. Essentially this is anyone who can keep you accountable.
2. Avoid conflict by educating people around you about ADHD.
3. Listen to feedback from trusted others. Similarly, try to be more self-aware and practice self-awareness
4. Give yourself permission to be you and break free from conventional everything.
5. Establish external structure.
6. Make your environment in itself stimulating. If you fail again and again to maintain a routine or structure, make the routine and structure stimulating. One example is to try color coding or adding creativity/fun to whatever you do.
7. Understand the concept of O.H.I.O - only handle it once. Respond to things immediately. Do not have a to do pile or to do list of things to do later that can be done now. Whenever possible, tackle things immediately rather than putting them off.
8. Set yourself up for success. Create an environment that rewards you for doing the things you need to do.
9. Understand your limitations by expecting some level of ""failures"". Account for some percent of things that will inevitably not get done or not work out. Don't beat yourself up about it.
10. Always make deadlines.
11. Break down tasks into smaller tasks. Then give those sub-tasks sub-deadlines.
12. Become self-aware of when you learn best and the odd conditions that allow you to get things done.
13. It's okay to multi-task and often people with ADHD are better at doing multiple things at once. Talk on the phone while creating your plan for the day. Jog and plan your essay outline in your head.
14. Leave time for transitions. Understand that it takes us longer to switch between tasks.
15. Keep a notepad with you at all times
16. Set time aside every week/every day for doing something you enjoy doing or for ""wasting"".
17. Learn how to name your feelings and try ""I feel... because..."" statements.
18. Take a ""time out"". Exactly like children do.
19. Advocate for yourself and your needs.
20. Exercise regularly. Schedule it into your routine.
21. Schedule activities with friends. Set social deadlines. Have a social calendar.
22. Compliment others. Spend time noticing other people.
23. Keep things out. Visual cues are the strongest cues. Put things you need for work by the door. Keep papers that need to be handled on a bulletin board. Put your empty coffee mug out to remind you to start the coffee pot.
24. Make it fun. Every activity you don't like - make it fun instead.
25. Habit stacking - Once you get one habit going... add habits onto it to create a routine. (ie. In the morning you normally get coffee, get dressed, and leave. If you want to add daily planning, then add the habit ""After I get my coffee, I will sit down at my desk and plan my day for five minutes. After planning, I will get dressed and leave."")
26. Know what times of day your biological clock works. Night owls do things at night; early birds accomplish things in the morning.
27. Use technology to get smart with the way you do things. Be creative with solutions. Stop doing things the hard way and let computers do it for you. Don't be afraid to use kids stuff to solve your problems.
28. Similarly, stop doing things you don't need to and ask for help. Learn to delegate things to people that are trusted and able to help.
29. Become friends with defeat and failure. Stop beating yourself up over failing.
30. Learn to say no. Stop over-committing.

1qcbg1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qcbg1r/the_emptiness_inside/,The Emptiness Inside,"My name is Richard Prater. I’m a 43 year old man, working as a cashier at Walmart, and I hate my life. 

It was a normal Tuesday. I got up at 10 A.M., to make it to my 11 A.M. shift, put on the cleanest looking clothes I could scavenge, that idiotic blue vest, and climbed into my shitty, beat up, reliable old Corolla and pulled out of the alley that I call a drive way. I stopped at Dunkin on the way and got some sort of craze something latte and 2 of the saddest little microwaved egg things I’ve ever eaten, I even scanned my stupid little reward points thing that I’ve never bothered to use. 

I got to the store at about 10:30 so I had a few minutes to kill. I walked through the entire store, to the dimly lit little dark hallway that contained our break room. I sat down, or you could say, collapsed into, the little brown faux leather couch and began to hyper analyze the stupid little employee motivation posters on the wall. I told myself if they made us do that obnoxious, humiliating chant today, I would come to this very room and hang myself with a rope from the hardware department. I even picked out the specific square in the ceiling grid that I would do it from. “Mark, go to 3.” Came plainly over the grilled intercom overhead. 

After walking up front to my assigned cash register of the day. I flipped on the switch, which lit up the yellow light above me, (16), “Just me and number 4 today.” I thought, looking back at the curly haired black girl who was wearing same blue vest, with different clothes on underneath. Chanel, or something like that. She was wearing a black hoodie with navy blue jeans, compared to my grey sweatshirt, and army green cargo pants. It was the middle of winter. 

A boy around 14 came to my line with a smug grin that I knew meant trouble. I immediately felt rigid and nearly lost my composure before he even said a word. “Hey man you’re that guy that lives in the shitty old apartment in the alley by Ridgeway High aren’t you?” “What are you doing working here?” His red hair contrasted greatly with his striped, different shades of green t shirt. “Well that’s a rude way of approaching an elder, isn’t it?” I snapped back, glaring at him questioningly. “Not when they are a cashier at Walmart.” He snapped back. 

I couldn’t believe this, all of the things I felt about myself being said aloud. I couldn’t tell if it was spiritually cleansing, or existentially destructive. The worst of it is, I still rang up his groceries. I still looked at him with the same vacant stare and said “Fourteen Dollars and Thirty Seven Cents.” Just as I would do with anyone else. Yet I felt humiliated, and I to this day cannot remember what he bought. 

Now, I knew all of these things about myself already. I knew I was a loser, I knew I was a 43 year old man, too old to be a cashier at Walmart. I knew my apartment was shitty, I knew I was the creepy guy living next to the old high school. But it broke me to realize with undying honesty that someone else realized it as well. I couldn’t stop moving, I had to go, I needed more. I don’t know of what, just of something. Something to take away this feeling that the world left me behind. That I didn’t really know what I was supposed to be doing. No one ever showed me. My Dad wasn’t around, and I don’t think my Mom really knew either. 

I went home hungry at the end of the day and sat by myself in complete silence; staring at my dark reflection in the little 24” television that was all I could afford. I had no face, I was just a body. A dark, empty, meaningless shape. I was nothing. 

My stomach growled but I had no urge to eat. I turned on the tv, picked up my phone and looked up, “what do people use as background noise when they are home alone?”, on Reddit. 
I started reading through a few different posts, mostly things like “Coffee Shop Jazz” “Travel documentaries”, you know, the things normal people think about. 

I got down a little more and something popped up that really peaked my interest. “I like to listen to Reddit horror stories on YouTube.” 

This caught my attention because I had never even thought of this idea before. I was always a fan of horror writers like Stephen King and Clive Barker, surely this was something that could fill some of the emptiness that had consumed my life. I began to listen and listen and listen. Stories of mothers gone insane, paranormal secrets of a family, people killed in cold blood. I loved it, I had a way to fill my time where people suffered more than I did. 

I began to want to be the creator of some of these stories, but I had no idea where to start, and my life wasn’t exactly a haven of inspiration. I started to come up with stories only to abandon them after a few paragraphs when my characters and plot began to feel shallow. I needed to get out of my house, and more importantly I needed to get out of my head. I needed to go out and find inspiration.

I began to frequent the midsize little downtown area where most of the bad shit in my city went down. At first it was the usual things every bar fly sees on a nightly basis, drunk guys screaming, bums angry because a man in a suit couldn’t spare a dollar, the endless catcalling of early 20s males with way too much confidence. 

Then I started to notice the darker corners of reality. The back alleys, under bridges, abandoned houses. I wanted to see what this underworld was about, I wanted to take it all in for myself and then go home and put it into words. Then I could truly create something meaningful. 

I saw a man stabbed on a street corner for no reason at all, I saw an abandoned dog tied to a tree whose short brown fur was stretched pathetically over its malnourished body, ribs and all. I didn’t cut it free. Quite frankly, I didn’t care. His life couldn’t be as bad as mine. 

I still went home and sat in front of my seedy little computer and couldn’t so much as come up with a word, I needed to live my stories. I couldn’t just pull something out of thin air. I needed to be the main character of the great story that I was going to write. I would go down in history, people would know me. It didn’t matter what is for. It didn’t matter if they hated me. They would know that I exist, I would know that I exist, and I would finally be able to be somebody. 

I walked out of my apartment into the perpetually damp cobblestone alley, with only one light for the whole way, it was rather dark. Good. My shoes didn’t even make a sound as I walked. I looked up at the old brick siding of Ridgeway high, it carried a certain dark serenity in the midnight glow, lit only by streetlights. There was movement near the front door, I stood next to the brick school sign out front, trying to cover my position. Why was a boy, alone, out in front of the school at night? 

I watched him as he made his way around the school, appearing to be looking for an unlocked way in. He found what he was looking for in a window on the west side, one of the teachers probably cracked it to let a little air in and forgot about it at the end of the day. I saw his feet slither in the window as he hopped in, grabbing with his hands and going in headfirst. I decided to follow. I came to the window, snuck a brief glance in, and when I didn’t see any sign of life, climbed in, feeling the handle of the knife in my waistband press into my stomach. 

I wandered through the unmapped halls of a high school I had never attended. Following a boy I had never seen. I passed through a set of open double doors into what appeared to be a large entrance hall, lined with glass cases full of trophies, important alumni, you know the drill. 

I heard a lock break to the right. I tiptoed as quietly as possible to the doorway of what looked to be a nurses office. Here was my Target. He had broken the medicine cabinet lock off with the end of a flashlight, and was sorting through the endless bottles and packets, not appearing to be satisfied with his findings. I took a quiet step back, not knowing what I had gotten myself into. “ Could I really go through with this?” I thought, but before I could even respond to my own thought the boy stepped through the door. I can do this, I thought, as I grabbed him and forced him to the floor. With my hands instinctively around his throat, I hadn’t realized that I couldn’t grab the knife and hold him down at the same time, so, like the animal that I am, I reacted. 

I began to lift his neck up, with my hands gripped around it as tight as I could manage, and I began to bash his head into the tile floor. I saw the light leave his body a little more each time it made contact. I expected a sharp, cracking sound, but instead it sounded soft. Like the sound of someone kicking a punching bag. I bashed his skull into the ground over and over again. I kept going after I knew that he was dead, I needed to be sure. After things went still I just stayed there, sitting on top of him for a while, he was already dead by the time I noticed he was wearing a green striped shirt, the same boy who started all this. “Dope fiend, no wonder.” I thought. 

There wasn’t as much blood as I expected. A small pool of it behind his head but that was all. I was able to clean it up with a couple of paper towels from the girls bathroom. I realized then that I wasn’t sure what I would do with the body. I hadn’t planned this. Or had I?

I found the janitors closet, grabbed a roll of black trash bags, a roll of duct tape, and decided that would be cover enough for me to at least get him home. It took two trash bags to cover him completely, he was 14 and hadn’t hit his growth spurt yet. There was one trash bag going over the feet up until about the waist, the other going over the head and meeting almost perfectly in the middle with the other. I unstuck a huge strip of duct tape, bit it off with my teeth, and began to seal the boy inside. When I was done, I picked up his lifeless body, which was lighter than I had expected. “Dope Fiend.” I thought, and laughed to myself. I carried him to the same window that I followed him through before, when we were both alive, and tossed his lifeless body out carelessly on the ground outside. There was a small cracking sound that I assume was his wrist breaking by the way he was on top of it when I scooped him up again. 

I arrived back to my home and looked at the digital clock sitting on my TV stand in the living room, 12:45, it read. “It all happened so fast.”, I thought. I could only think of one place that would make sense for a dead body, the bathtub. I laid him inside, left the trash bags covering him, and poured the tiny bit of ice I had in the freezer on top of him. “I will pick up a couple bags tomorrow.” I thought. 

The night continued on with no rest possible, the adrenaline in my system was like nothing I had ever experienced in my life. I couldn’t think of anything else, I know this was something I could get locked away for, but I no longer cared. I was like an animal. An animal that needed the kill. I needed more. I decided to wait until the following night and go back to the seedy little downtown area where I had started. 

When I stepped out of my Corolla onto the pavement downtown, I was a man on a mission. This time I wanted a woman, I had to even it out. One man, one woman, the perfect Union. I would know her when I saw her. So I walked the dimly lit streets and searched. I saw one woman after another yet none of them felt right. They all eyed me with the same suspicious eyes, like they could see through me, see why I was here. I got in line outside of a little club with loud music blaring from inside. I got up to the sweaty, meat head bouncer, and as I reached for my back pocket, I realized I hadn’t even bothered with my wallet. “Dont waste my time, fella.” He said, and promptly moved me off to the side to make room for the whorish looking women behind me. 

That was when I saw her. She was walking away from me, black curly hair, a black woman from what I could tell in the dark of night. She was carrying one of those department store paper bags with the handles in her left hand. This was the one. I felt it. I could feel the goosebumps stand up on my arm. My penis was halfway erect from the moment I saw her until well after she had died. I was aroused just at the thought of what I was going to do to her. I followed her down the street, keeping a safe distance so she wouldn’t distinguish me from any other bystander on the street. She turned left and went past a sign into a parking lot in a little square just behind the buildings on the Main Street. “$5 parking”, the sign said. I watched as she put her bags into her truck, and as soon as she closed it, I grabbed her. 

This one had a little more fight in her than the boy did. She screamed a little, trying to swat at my face with her long, fake nails, and even succeeded it a little, although I didn’t feel it until the next day. Finally, I reached into my waistband, pulled out my knife, and held it at her throat. She stopped, both hands raised slightly with her elbows level with her shoulders. “Please don’t do this!” She begged. “Shut your fucking mouth.” I told her, and slapped her full force across the face. God that felt good. I grabbed her by her hair, made her turn her back to me, and put my knife to her throat. “Please, no, don’t do this!” She pleaded, even more desperately than the first time. With that I slid my knife effortlessly across her throat. You never forget the sound of cutting someone’s throat open. Its subtle. The screams are not. I had to hold my hands over her mouth to avoid anyone else hearing. After a few seconds the blood rushed out of her mouth, and combined with her saliva it oozed through my fingers onto the concrete of the parking lot. She squirmed and squirmed but eventually she stopped. I let go of her hair and she flopped face first onto the ground, lifeless. 

I picked up her purse and felt around inside until I found her keys. I pressed the little trunk button on it, got it opened up, and forced her body inside. I used the new clothes she had bought while shopping to lay her on, in order to soak up the excess blood that was still oozing out of her throat. I wiped as much blood as I could off of my hands onto her shirt. 

I closed the trunk, took the keys and got inside the drivers side of her beat up Pontiac, deciding I would drive back to my car, transfer the body, and leave hers in the parking lot there. I did just that, I changed the station from hip hop radio. I couldn’t take any of that noise, after going through every channel, I turned it off, and rode the rest of the way in silence. 
 
I got to my car about 12:30 that night, wrapped her in 2 more of the trash bags from the roll I swiped from the school, the same technique I used for the boy. After I lifted her out of her trunk, and into mine, I decided to use another trash bag to clean up the blood stained clothing that I had laid her on. I picked them up with my bare hands, I figured, her blood is already on me, what more could it really hurt. After I picked up the clothes, I looked in the front and backseat, planning to wipe up any more evidence that I had left. Laying on the backseat, was a blue Walmart vest with a nametag attached that said “Janelle.” “Hot damn.” I thought, “I never even noticed.”

I drove her home, carried her heavy ass into my shitty apartment and tossed her in the tub with the boy. She fit right next to him, and her feet didn’t even come all the way out of the tub, this way I would be able to cover them completely with ice. This way I could keep them here with me as long as possible, a reminder of who I used to be, who they used to be. I wished I could have them forever, but I knew that this wasn’t the case, it couldn’t be the case. I’m a Walmart cashier, I can’t afford a deep freezer at the drop of a hat. I hadn’t decided what I would do with them, yet, I had a few thoughts at this point. I knew I could afford a hatchet, or a handsaw. Maybe I’ll toss them in a river, surely something would eat them. 

I walked into my warm living room, walked past my sad 24” television, and sat down at my computer. I began to type, the words began to flow effortlessly, there was no need to make up anything anymore. I had lived out my stories, and now it was time to tell them. Her blood had turned to brown under my fingernails as I pressed down on the keys. Word for word I typed out my stories, telling the internet everything I had done, and they all loved it. They ate it up. I presented it as a piece of fiction and they received it as a work of art. Now they all want a sequel.

I feel like I'm mourning these moments of connection with my partner and family and friends, even cooking ourselves. I'm mourning getting coffee and drinks and being a little tipsy. I feel like I'll never travel again. I had made it a big deal to start eating whole ingredients and cooking for myself but I have no clue how to do that without garlic, onion or tomatoes.

This has been a whirlwind year of discovering multiple limiting health problems and I guess I'm just feeling pretty defeated and like every last bit of joy in my life is being taken away from me. I'm only 27 and I'm feeling like I've suddenly stopped being fun to be around or do anything with. I know I'm being dramatic as many of us here are in the same boat but living fulfilling lives, so any words of comfort? Will I ever be able to indulge a tiny bit even as a cheat once in a while?

I do drink black coffee as well I just like a variety. I don't have stuff like the giant sugar loaded frappes they sell at Starbucks lmao.

Everyone talks about the benefits of doing day-week long fasts but I'm wondering do you still get positive effects from doing say low calorie days where you don't eat much at all. An example would be having something very nutritious like eating a couple of fruits and a high quality protein or fat source at some point. I'm plant based so I like a protein shake with banana, almond butter, grass fed milk (or plant milk). For the protein powder I get grass fed whey but have had some decent vegan ones before.

My question is basically do you to get benefits doing very low calorie days here and there or will it be still nothing compared to going fully fasted?",2,1768357839.0,fasting,2,1.0,False

Rationale for the potential purchase: I mostly drink dark roast filtered coffee, using a Clever dripper. But I often like to have a cappuccino or latte as well. For the espresso drinks, I have to go to the local coffee shop. I have small kids, including a newborn, so there won’t be many of those trips in the near future. Having a machine would be nice.

Mira looked like someone who lived inside a secondhand folk tale.

A mushroom-print dress swayed around her knees, cinched by a sunflower-colored sash that didn’t match — and somehow made everything match. Her glasses were absurdly large, thick enough to qualify as armor, and scratched to the point where you weren’t sure if they amplified vision or obscured it entirely. Maybe they were a filter. Maybe she preferred it that way.

Two messy buns of red hair made her look younger than she was, but the tattoos winding down her arms told a different story — fine-line creatures from folklore, geometric sunrises, ghosts made of vines. There was a kind of lived-in conviction to how she moved, like someone who didn’t need to be seen to know she was real.

She met Romy in a stairwell that smelled like wet plaster and broken promises. Mira had been squatting on the fifth floor for two weeks already — legally, according to no one. But she had turned the hallway into a greenhouse of scavenged plants and mismatched tea mugs. The building was supposed to be condemned, but Mira called it “pre-sanctified.” Said the city had only forgotten it because it wasn’t ready to remember it yet.

She offered Romy coffee made in a repurposed moka pot balanced on a camping stove and a stack of banned zines to read while it brewed.

“You’re not broken,” she said without preamble, like she’d been waiting to say it.

Romy blinked.

“I didn’t say I was.”

“You didn’t have to. Your silence is very articulate.”

---

Mira didn’t ask for backstory. She just listened to the static in between Romy’s answers. Said she could hear frequencies that weren’t words — pain shaped like detuned piano chords.

But she never treated Romy like a problem to be solved.

Mira believed in friction. She said healing wasn’t about going back to normal. It was about learning to walk differently with the limp.

And for once, Romy didn’t feel like a glitch in someone else's program. She felt like a signal — scrambled, maybe, but coming through.

He is quite impulsive (ex., kissing Harris in the club, running to say sorry to Harris). There are many moments where he describes a need to get energy out of his system (ex., running on the beach, in the gym after asking Harris to just be friends). There are times when he acts without having any thoughts (ex, when he asks for the apple pin from Kyle). He sometimes just stops talking in the middle of sentences, says things he doesn't mean to, and zones out of conversations. He is described as ""Blurting things out"" quite a bit. He has a waiting mode (ex., on Christmas waiting for Harris to reply to his text). He hyperfocuses (ex., always asking Harris about coming out). Constant fidgeting (ex., coffee cup, biting fingernails).

I found it really funny when Harris described him as weird when he would (literally) run away after bringing up an uncomfortable topic.

I think that this really adds to the mental health of his character. Although I don't think he has anxiety or depression, it is clear that his mental health isn't great, especially at the beginning of the book. He has low self-esteem and doesn't think he is ""normal"". I think some of these thoughts about himself stem a bit from his neurodivergence and trying to fit into a neurotypical world. It also contributes to the way that he regulates his emotions (ex., playing angry and having an outburst against the ref, bottling up his emotions for all of them to be let out after coming out to his dad).",6,1768357403.0,heatedrivalry,3,0.88,False

half a litre or rum down i was low enough to realise alcohol does not make me happy anymore, it’s no longer fun being drunk.

I am a disappointment to my son and everyone that loves me.

A short back story I am 34 years old and have an alcoholic father, I was always against drinking and would be forever tipping out beers from my partner at the time.

I did not accept drinking in my house not even 1 beer.

I grew up in an alcoholic home, with a father that would abuse my mother & vise Versa, plus all the other trauma threats of suicide, emotional manipulation, not knowing if you were getting the sober dad that could manage or the drunk lunatic.

I swore I would never become him or her.

My partner used to drink heavy, he wouldn’t get abusive or anything like my father, but, he would come home drunk from the club & I HATED the fact he needed to drink to be happy.

He would always try to get me to go into the liquor store with him or have a drink, he would say Im prudish & I need to let my hair down.

Well when our son was 2 my partner and sons father was in a horrific accident and died.

In the year of hes passing I started to form a relationship with alcohol, I got the taste for it, and initially it made me feel like I could cope, I could cry freely, feel again and the words ringing in head that I need to let my hair down.

I would hold my glass to the sky and say this one is for you my love.

It becomes a sickening reality.

the first time I got black out drunk i woke up to my friend pulling me out of my swimming pool. There have been too many times to count since that night that I have blacked out.

In the early days i were able to not drink again for however long, and it became an excuse oh Im just an occasional binge drinker, then again i would have friends over and before I knew it my alcohol free house had a bar and was always stocked with what ever you could want.

I developed a pattern, only drinking once a month then it became every weekend then every night.

For the past 10 years i have averaged 300-500mls of rum or vodka a night.

My appearance sucks, my life sucks & everyone seems to have moved on around me and I am stuck.

Even my son who used to enjoy my drunk antics, music on dancing. Just comes home sees me out the back drinking shakes hes head and shuts the door.

I have always made excuses for my drinking such as, well my son still attends school everyday, I still work full time and never miss a shift, the house is clean, I cook everyday, my house is paid off, you name it and I could excuse the fact that simply Im an alcoholic.

3 months ago I went to the doctor and my kidneys haven’t been working and I have protein in the urine and my liver is inflamed. My body is succumbing and I am killing myself mouthful by mouthful.

I had this realisation 3 days ago after I had thrown up again all over the shower floor knowing I had work to attend in 4 hours & now Ive got to come home and clean up my disgrace.

I have officially put down the bottle, I can’t say if it will be forever but I am hoping to god i never touch it again, it’s my first time of being this long without a drink in as long as I can remember.

Yesterday I sweated and had shakes I had sweat pouring off me. Today my skin is cold like Ice but my skin already looks shiner and even though I’m severely tired today was the first morning i have awoken to the birds and listened with clarity, I could pour a cup of coffee and drink it without feeling sick or spewing.

I feel motivated as ever today to keep going.

I guess I just wanted to put my admissions out there, one day I hope to repair with my son all the times he was embarrassed of me, hated me looked at me disgusting, just as I did with my father he has done with me.

I feel disgusting I never broke the cycle for him & he lost he’s father and I have been so fking selfish.

I just want this out there feel free to tell me Im horrible or share your own story.

I am only 3 days in, I can’t wait to be 30 years in if I get there.

Let me say what’s gone wrong so that I can tell you what’s gone right. These all use skim milk, sub a nondairy alternative of your choice. \*\*Skip to the end for a TL;DR\*\*

\*\*The wrong\*\* 😑 

\* Protein powder in hot coffee? Becomes chunky, cooks like scrambled eggs. 0/10

\* Protein powder into cold milk and pour into hot coffee? Comes out kind of chunky and makes the coffee VERY thick, unpalatable for some. 2/10

\* Ultra filtered high protein milk substitute? Increases your protein, but not as much as protein milk. Still can’t mix in protein powder. 4/10

\* Full scoop of protein powder? It’s definitely going to be thick. 4/10

\*\*The right\*\*

First, work your way up to a full scoop of protein powder. Start with 1/4 scoop. A ‘thin’ feeling protein powder will feel the most like a normal coffee, Transparent Labs being my favorite and Six Star and Ghost being my least favorite. Optimum Nutrition (ala Costco) is mid and to really have to lower your expectations to use this to start.

\*\*Ingredients\*\*

\* Milk frother, check online, about $20-30

\* Sugar free syrup, can be flavored if you want. I get this from a large retailer (used to be Cash & Carry) $4

\* 1C, Milk of choice (ultra filtered for extra protein)

\* 1 shot coffee (or strong instant)

\* 1/4 scoop protein powder, recommend Transparent Labs or a ‘thin’ protein of your choice

\*\*TL;DR\*\* Instructions: Mix 2T of sugar free syrup with the 1/4 scoop protein powder until like a paste. Froth milk. Pour frothed milk slowly over the paste while swirling. It should all mix in and be silky smooth. Once mixed, drop the coffee shot in. Should be silky smooth, creamy, and once you work up to a full scoop it can be up to 41g protein (28g Transparent Labs, 13g Fairlife skin) and 210 calories.

Allow me to repeat.... I hate vegetables.

Recently, while playing with a free access AI, I gave my health parameters and over 4 months, through trial and effect, created a nutrition plan that also rocks gut health. All based on science.

There is no ""off the shelf"" nutrition plan and working one with an AI and test/cross checking has worked great, improved my bloodwork (doctor is like WTF????) and I feel pretty friggin' good.

I do 2-3 smoothies a day with my regular meals.

Please bear in mind I’m working at consistency of intake, chugging it and getting it out of the way, and data backed interactions. I don’t like vegetable so these still taste ick for me but 10 seconds of ick vs. 5-10 minutes of chewing. It’s a win for me and my gut+overall health.

I provided the AI my age, medications, health issues and goals. This includes surviving prostate cancer (radiation). I also addressed any cautions or interaction “problems” (just stuff to watch for). Checked the science. Also popped it into other AIs to evaluate. 

No, I don’t care what data they save on me or use to train their AI, lol.  
Heck, throw in pointers if you want.

Yes, I eat like a boss. Example, breakfast, 1 egg, 50g egg white, scrambled with 15g shredded mozzarella, 35g of my homemade kimchi on top, 2 organic chicken sausages. Plus, a big ass cup of my homemade cold brew coffee with Silk soymilk and some sugar-free caramel coffee syrup (the only sugar-free product I allow myself). Oh, and yes, I use a food tracker. Makes it easy once you get going.

That sound like punishment? I chug my smoothie before I make breakfast so  I can enjoy the yummy stuff

Here is what it looks like. I am just sharing info.  
If you want, copy and past it to any AI and ask it ""what are all the health benefits and interaction benefits of these specific amounts spread out during the day"". Watch the data pile up :)

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.

I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere in the world)
* 20–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me: You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

1. One thing you’d love to do together on a lazy Sunday
2. Where you are right now (city/prefecture in Japan, or city abroad)
3. One question for me

I’m patient and only looking for one person.

This doesn't cover all of my thoughts but I think I want to put together a timeline before I try to put it into words :P

>!The town of gloaming is inundated with the Fae. Everything links back to Fae lore such as the links from Fig using Europa’s Fairy Tales ([https://www.gloamingcounty.com/down-down](https://www.gloamingcounty.com/down-down)) the videos from the scribe ([https://youtu.be/DX8kw0vYBRA?si=SHr3LbJsNxL2smAw](https://youtu.be/DX8kw0vYBRA?si=SHr3LbJsNxL2smAw)) and even the books on Shelly’s bookshelf ([https://shellyfennel.tumblr.com/post/775393632226312192/i-have-been-reading-copiously-to-pass-the-time-i](https://shellyfennel.tumblr.com/post/775393632226312192/i-have-been-reading-copiously-to-pass-the-time-i)) Then there are the time slips ([https://violetegress.tumblr.com/post/791162179273572352/time-slips](https://violetegress.tumblr.com/post/791162179273572352/time-slips)), like that’s just falling into the Fae realm that description is right out of Fae lore (I think this is also why Shelly’s body seemed to have decayed for years). it all leads back to the Fae. !<

>!Fig is a fae creature but not the queen which we know because of the story ([https://violetegress.tumblr.com/post/795235063934631936/lamb-eyes-ii](https://violetegress.tumblr.com/post/795235063934631936/lamb-eyes-ii)) from violet about the Well incident.!<

>!Does anyone know when she went missing? I thought it might be in 2013.!<

>!Since Violette is called the “child of the rotting queen” ([https://imgur.com/a/BpE4ECE](https://imgur.com/a/BpE4ECE) also note that the post is from 2013 a very important year from what we’ve seen) and we know she is the child of Winona from the Halloween takeover. Winona was taken to be consumed/become to Fae queen. Maybe, her taking was instrumented and then covered by the Reverend as they have a history of “picking targets” ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojt2HvLKq1g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojt2HvLKq1g)) one of whom I think was Winona and potentially Shelly.!<

>!Anyways, I think that maybe there is something in her bloodline that has an affinity for the Fae and that the Fae wants her for something like being the next Fae queen. The implication of a rotting queen might mean that there needs to be a replacement, that or that simply they are associated with the rot which is quite obvious given the symptoms from the symptoms page are basically Fae warning signs ([https://www.gloamingcounty.com/symptoms](https://www.gloamingcounty.com/symptoms)) what I find interesting about the symptoms of the rot are that the Unexplained noises show up twice with “singing or s…” having 14 responses and “choir music…” having 2. I am very interested on what that difference is. There seems to be a physical rot that has to be removed though, so maybe it’s a sickness. With the code from Trail Cams ([TAPE 5: TRAIL CAMS - WELCOME TO GLOAMING COUNTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdaGD6-Da4k)) using “it hurts” and “we are rotting” maybe the things consumed by the rot become thralls of the Fae as the deer walkers? I got a bit off topic.!<

>!I just don’t understand why Fig would have pulled her back up from the well and then apologize to the Queen if it was the Queen who told Fig to not drop violet. Unless there is some underlying motive for Fig to not drop Violet (because it definitely was not emotional attachment given how Fig speaks of her in certain posts such as the super secret blog), I think Violet might have influenced Fig. What if she has some kind of power or influence over the Fae and that’s why she was able to interact with Fig for so long without being consumed. Violet’s mother from 8 5 9 18 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rTeB4jdZ44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rTeB4jdZ44)) specifically mentions for Violet to not be afraid of ‘them’ and that she is the heir. The Scribe says in the FairytaleRead along video ([https://youtu.be/DX8kw0vYBRA?si=yk41aDLOoimIIUAg](https://youtu.be/DX8kw0vYBRA?si=yk41aDLOoimIIUAg)) that the Egresses, as in the bloodline?, are forever falling down rabbit holes of their own design. Maybe she wasn’t “ready” to become the next Queen and Fig was apologizing for pushing her too soon. I really don’t know what to think about this.!<

>!In addition I think that there is some kind of ancient accord with the Fae since during 2013 there was a legendarily good harvest ([https://imgur.com/a/nGSyU8K](https://imgur.com/a/nGSyU8K)) if this was the year that Winona went missing - though I am unsure of that - then that could be the reason that the Fae take people and “want more”. I think that there is a connection to the agriculture of the town and the Fae, maybe the introduction of a new Queen allowed for the nature in the area to thrive. A lot of the hidden text in the news pages reference harvests.!<

>!Also there is whatever is going on in the water. This could be connected to the agricultural benefits thing in which the Fae are messing with the water potentially to effect the agriculture. I think the idea of the Well being a vessel of the Queen ([https://violetegress.tumblr.com/post/795235063934631936/lamb-eyes-ii](https://violetegress.tumblr.com/post/795235063934631936/lamb-eyes-ii))  is a good indication of the connection between the Fae and the water. In addition The Scribe’s entire video on the Gator Grotto video which lambasts the archive on their redaction of parts of the video on the archive channel specifically mentions “It’s in the pipes, a disease with many arms and legs” (of note is the video within the pipes dated 03/12/2008 or 2006 I am unsure since it its blurry, this can be seen  at time stamp 0:10) ([https://youtu.be/Tj6a3yLeU6M?si=y8T02sBG\_iHFzSDQ](https://youtu.be/Tj6a3yLeU6M?si=y8T02sBG_iHFzSDQ)) I think there is absolutely something wrong with the drinking water and it has to do with the Fae, specifically what is unknown but again I posit it being agricultural or just infecting the town and strengthening the towns connection to the Fae (don’t eat Fae food style).!<

>!Extending on this: Who is The Scribe? From the photo google drive link ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tLa4NLuZD1BWfLZ1UzHAhviW0I1Z0b3c/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tLa4NLuZD1BWfLZ1UzHAhviW0I1Z0b3c/view)) on the LulaRay’s diner page ([https://lularays.carrd.co](https://lularays.carrd.co)) it refers to the coffee as escape. But in the super secret blog post Fig states in an alt text that “he sleeps in the bottom of your coffee cup” among other ominous statements ([https://super-specialsecretblog.tumblr.com/post/778142018366062592](https://super-specialsecretblog.tumblr.com/post/778142018366062592)). These seem to be conflicting at first but, if you think about the Fae and Fig’s connection to dreams it makes sense. Dreams seem to be a way for the Fae to influence an individual from the fairy tale read along ([https://youtu.be/DX8kw0vYBRA?si=yk41aDLOoimIIUAg](https://youtu.be/DX8kw0vYBRA?si=yk41aDLOoimIIUAg)) and when your coffee cup is empty you won’t be able to drink more and stay awake to escape Fig’s grasp. I could be reaching here though, but it seems like The Scribe has a good handle on what exactly is going on in Gloaming.!<

Anyways I think my next goal will be trying to piece together a timeline because tis very difficult to put together a story. >!Maybe once I make a timeline I’ll speculate on when the “bad gateways” to the Fae were opened and things like that from the references on Violet’s YouTube channel and blog posts.!<",2,1768356675.0,GloamingCounty,0,1.0,False

Listener! Yeah, you, Listener! Don’t you see me with all these heavy bags?! Didn’t your mother ever tell you to help a damsel in distress!

…

Haha, I’m just messing with you! Though, I really could really use some help with these bags…

…

You’ll help me? Oh, that’s great! All I need you to do is just put these on my kitchen floor – the door’s already unlocked. You can take these four, and I’ll take these three. You’re the big, strong man after all\~

*God, the way he looks when exerting himself is just-*

N-No, I didn’t say anything? What are you talking about?

…

\*doorknob clicks\*

…

Yeah, yeah, just right there. That works, thanks!

Man, I bought so much at the store this time around… Thank god you happened to be right around the corner, huh?

…

Well, would you like to stay for some tea? Coffee, maybe? It’s the least I can do to repay you, and hey, we’ve never had a chance to talk! We’ve been living in the same apartment block for what, almost 6 months now? So don’t be a stranger and come sit!

…

I’ve got oolong tea, earl gray, and peppermint, do you have a preference? Oh, and black coffee too! I don’t have any creamer, but if you like it black, you’re in luck.

…

\*brewing noises\*

…

Alright, here’s your drink!

I apologize if the taste is off, though – you know, with the apartment being old and all, the tap water isn’t exactly the cleanest tasting stuff around…

…

Oh, you like it? I’m glad! You’re welcome to have as much as you want.

So, what made you decide to live here out of all places? There’s like, more than 10 housing blocks around here!

…

Ah, yeah, rent prices aren’t the best right now, are they? I don’t blame you for that being your deciding factor… But hey, if your apartment is anything like mine, the kitchen is surprisingly modern, and you even get a bigger freezer than most other places I looked at…

*Not like I’d need that for anything in particular, though…*

A-Ahem! Well, I just don’t think it’s all that bad of a place to live!

…

Aha, I’m glad you agree. So, what do you do to afford the rent? Or are you a student in college?

…

I see, I see. That must be tough, studying and working at the same time. I’m lucky to only be a freshman right now… I’m sure once I get up to your level, I’ll be working a lot harder.

…

Now that I think about it, I swear I’ve seen you around campus… *Well, more than just on campus...*

…

What do you mean you feel..?

…

\*thump\*

…

Wow, and they’re out like a light!\~ I really didn’t expect the medicine to act this quickly, but I guess the pharmacists really weren’t lying to me. Now I’ve gotta drag the to the bedroom, and…

…

…

…

Awwwwww\~ Their sleeping face is just too cute… and the color of their eyes, it’s just so…

…

*Wait, the color of their eyes?*

You’re awake, not asleep?!

…

Ahaha, oh my, you didn’t say anything! You shouldn’t scare me like that, darling. It’s really not good for my heart…

…

Oh, no no no! Don’t struggle like that, you’ll just give yourself rope burn!

…

O-Okay, well, at least you stopped moving…

…

One question at time, slow down!!! I’ll explain everything in a minute, I promise! I just need you to be quiet so I can explain this at least semi-coherently.

…

Okay… to be as blunt as possible, *because you’re dense as shit,* I’m in love with you.

…

D-Don’t just look at me like that! God, urgh! Say something! Anything! Please!

…

Oh for Christ's sake- Yes, I’m being honest!! I’m not here to kill you, or torture you, or steal your organs, or anything like that, I’m here to make you mine, because other girls won’t stop laying their **grubby fucking hands on you!**

…

S-sorry. I didn’t mean to shout. I just… I’m a bit overwhelmed, ahaha. With you here, finally in my grasp, I’m ecstatic, but also really tense, because anything could go wrong. I can’t have you hate me, I absolutely can’t I can’t I can’t I can’t-

Ah! Um… Okay… breathe in, breath out… phew.

…

Darling. With all of my heart, I promise that I love you. Whatever I need to do to prove it to you, I will do. As cliché as it is, I would walk to the ends of the earth if it meant I got to be with you for a second longer. And with time… you’ll come to love me, too. I’m not expecting it to happen immediately, but the faster the better, right? Ahaha...

…

Oh, and you’re not going to be escaping, or calling for help. I trust you enough to not have gagged you, but that’s not an excuse to start shouting. So don’t push it. I’m not patient like you are.

…

Your expression is still… Well, whatever. Eventually, your eyes will look at me with love, not **this** expression that makes it feel like you’re trying to analyze my every thought and action…

…

Haah… I suppose if you’re already tied up like this, and you’re not going to talk, then I’ll look through your phone instead. If you’re with anybody right now, and I somehow didn’t know about it, then that’s about to change. Oh, and no need to tell me your password. I already know it\~

…

Oh? What’s this? A closed conversation with Haley…

…

O-Oh my… this is…

…

Ahaha… Oh my god, if I get my hands on her, I swear I’ll-! No, no, calm down! I’m not going to kill her! But wow, breaking up with you over text like this is really just the most douche bag move possible! Nobody has any idea how to act like an adult in relationships anymore...

…

D-Don’t look so down! You have **me** now, I’m here for you, and I promise I’ll be a thousand times better than Haley ever was to you.

…

I understand that it’s hard to move on. And with these texts being 4 months old, and you not having dated since then… there’s obviously some leftover emotions to sort out. So I’ll be here to help you through them. I promise. I know I said I wasn’t patient, but when it comes to you, I promise to try really, really hard.

…

W-wait, you’re..? Hold on, I’ll untie you now-!

…

C-come here, darling. On the bed. There there… I’m here, and I’m not going anywhere. So cry all you need to. Just let it all out.

...

*God, what did she do to you that made you like this?*

…

Do you want to talk about it at all? I’m going to listen to you no matter what, so you can say whatever comes to mind…

…

N-no? Okay, well, I’m just going to continue holding you then. I hope you don’t mind, but it really doesn’t look like you do…

…

What was that? “Thank you”..? Oh, uh, you don’t need to thank me, but… I’m really glad I can be here for you like this. I promise with all my heart that I truly had no malicious intentions when it came to kidnapping you… As long as I get to keep you, I’ll only do whatever you’re comfortable with. I won’t force anything onto you, or god forbid hurt you physically. So please… stay here, with me.

…

Y-you will?! Really?! Oh, you’ve made me so happy, darling!\~ I promise that I’ll never ever do anything to break your trust in me. My arms will **always** be a place you can return to, for as long as I walk this earth.

…

\*kiss\*

…

Aaaah… that felt really, really good. But you’re so emotional right now that I couldn’t forgive myself if I pushed you for more- mmpf!

\*kiss\*

…

Oh, wow… when you take the lead like that, I really just can’t control… n-no! I have to stay composed! Now is not the time to be doing this when your face is still stained by tears…

…

I’m glad you could return the favor. Truly, I am, but what you need right now is to go to sleep. It’s already late, and it’ll help to stabilize your emotions.

And don’t worry, I won’t be going anywhere. I’ll be right here beside you the entire night… So feel free to push into me or hug me tighter, I really won’t mind\~

…

*I’m so relieved that I have you in my possession now, darling… For as long as I live, I’ll never let go…*",2,1768356155.0,ASMRScriptHaven,0,1.0,False

Since we ended things he has been acting odd, somedays he is somewhat cold or extremely friendly with me but other days its the complete opposite, we go on late night calls til 3am, he has got me a gift unprompted, he invited me to a Spotify jam, sent me a message with ‘x’ roughly 7 times, and called me pet names like bae and sweetie.

An example of an message, I was out for coffee with a friend and I was texting the situation-ship, he asked what I was doing and I said I was out with a friend and we were catching up with life, he responded ‘hope you aren’t talking about me x’ (that was roughly the message, I can’t remember or see the message again) my friend read this message and said that it was flirting and its odd that he is doing it soon after ending things so soon.

I want to talk to him about this next time we see each other but I don’t know how to approach it, I still like him a lot and I have tried talking to other guys and move on but it hasn’t worked for me, I don’t want to hurt him, make him feel uncomfortable or lost the friendship that we have but I cant keep staying confused about what we are or stay stuck on the idea that we could possibly try again with a relationship when he has no interest in doing that.

1qcagzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/procurement/comments/1qcagzb/transitioning_from_eaoffice_manager_pe_to/,Transitioning from EA/Office Manager (PE) to Procurement | Seeking Advice & Feedback,"Hi everyone,

As the title suggests, I am looking to transition from an Administrative path into Procurement. I currently work at a Private Equity firm in Boston supporting 2–4 C-suite executives and a team of 20+. I also manage all office operations. In this role, I wear many hats that extend far beyond my formal scope, and I’ve realized I have reached the ceiling for growth at my current firm.

I am fully aware that this transition may involve a substantial initial pay cut. However, I believe the long-term growth potential and career trajectory in Supply Chain will far outweigh the short-term dip. I am drawn to Procurement because many of my current responsibilities involve transferable skills that I believe will give me a competitive edge, despite not having a formal ""Procurement"" title.

My daily responsibilities include (Indirect Procurement) sourcing, contract negotiation, supplier quality assessments, RFxs from different vendors for many different office related items, company related matters and company wide events. These, of course, are in a smaller scale of things given that it is a small team.  

For example: 

* Products that come into the office:
   * Office supplies, company gear (vests, umbrellas, specially made notebooks with company logo and apple smell embedded on the paper itself... yes really) and anything related to special items for investor events.
* Contract Negotiation/relationship
   * Vendors for the company gear, or event specific item
   * Venue contracts for these events. As well as keeping the relationship with each vendor/supplier for future work and more flexible terms based on relationship.  
   * RFxs from different suppliers to evaluate price, quality, and speed for delivery. 
* Supplier Quality Assessment
   * Again, at a smaller scale, but I have to make sure we are getting what we paid for and not getting ripped off in the process. So need to explore different options and do research based on what is available online, which can be a lot. 

All in all, I am eager to move into a field where I can leverage my full potential and avoid pushing this transition down the road since life just gets more complicated.  

My Plan (Now through August): I am targeting August for this transition, as my wife will be graduating and starting her full-time role then, providing us with more financial stability while I make the transition. Between now and then, I plan to:

1. Certifications: Complete the CourseCareers Supply Chain Procurement course to build a foundational knowledge base.
2. Technical Knowledge: Deepen my understanding of MSAs, SOWs, SLAs, supplier scorecards, and cost breakdowns.
3. Systems: Gain exposure to ERP systems.
4. Networking: Be interview-ready by July.

Profile Info: 

* 28M 
* HCOL Boston, MA
* Current full comp $130k (it goes up very slow from here since at my current firm there is no room to move into another department or title bump that would merit big $$ bump) 

The Big question is: Am i crazy for making this jump? I'm looking for honest, to the point feedback that can give me some clarity at this point. 

Also, if anyone in the Boston area works in Procurement, I’d love to buy you a coffee and pick your brain about the local market.

TIA.

I moved to Vancouver about 2 years ago and, while life is good, I genuinely miss having a solid group of friends. The kind with random hangouts, laughter, and just good vibes.

I’m 30, work in banking in Downtown Vancouver, and I’m really into fitness and combat sports (BJJ, Muay Thai, MMA). I train regularly, but also very chill outside the gym. Whether coffee walks, exploring the city, deep conversations, or just hanging out.

I’m in a relationship, but looking to build my own circle of friends. Regardless of gender and which is independent of my partner’s social circle.

Not to boast but i’m easygoing, friendly, and always down to try new things. If you also moved here, work around DT, or just want to expand your social circle, let’s connect. Even better if you’re into training, staying active, or just being a good human.

Feel free to comment or DM. Let’s make Vancouver feel a little more like home. 🌹

1qcae97,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1qcae97/i_was_in_a_gang_that_solved_mysteries_in_college/,I was in a gang that solved mysteries in college. Everything changed when we discovered who we really were.,"It was midnight when I stumbled into our office, two lukewarm coffees in hand.

Well, not exactly ‘our’ office.

Middleview North University didn’t recognize us as a real club. 

Apparently, “Investigative newspaper” didn’t cut it. 

When we pleaded our case to the dean, he relented and let us use the storage closet on the third floor of the arts building. 

Small victories. 

At the back of my mind, I knew exactly why we weren’t being taken seriously. 

We hadn’t solved one mystery. Our whole shtick was, “We will take any case!” Whether it’s small, like a cheating partner, or big like a kidnapping. 

We promised to solve them all. And then, we didn't.

After fumbling almost all of our cases, we had one last chance to prove ourselves.

This time, with a real mystery.

Four months ago, two 19 year old male MNU students went missing.

The only thing left behind was their right shoes. We were stumped. 

The local police were useless, so we took it upon ourselves to prove we weren’t just loser college kids trying to be Scooby Doo rejects.

As expected, the storage closet was the size of a prison cell—or maybe that was being generous.

The three of us managed to squeeze in a desk and a chair, and I still felt like I was stepping into Narnia every time I entered. 

Above my head, an old chandelier swung from a broken chain, like any day, it would fail like we had and come crashing down. 

I wanted to ask why a storage closet had a chandelier, but I had a feeling the answer would give me a migraine. 

Tonight was no different than any other. I was exhausted after spending my day off in the library researching the town’s local history. 

I gave up when my phone became too tempting, and I started doomscrolling TikTok. I only snapped out of it when a guy from one of my classes, sitting across from me, started talking about the missing boys. 

He asked me about the case, and I just shrugged and said, “We’re working on it.”

We were, in fact, *not* working on it. The police had already issued us a cease and desist, so we had no access to reports.

All we had was the tiny office we called home. Kicking off my shoes, I ducked inside, clutching the coffees to my chest. 

Only two people were allowed inside at once, due to safety hazards or whatever. 

The university really would rather we suffocate than give us actual damn space.

“I hope you like slightly warm coffee,” I said, squeezing into the closet.

“You’re late,” a voice grumbled from inside.

Piled on top of our desk were a laptop and a pile of unsolved cases. Sitting hunched over his MacBook sat Aris Caine, his squinty eyes illuminated in the sharp, fluorescent glow from our Ikea lamp.

Disheveled as usual, glasses perched atop thick blonde curls, hair a tangled mess hanging in overshadowed eyes. He’d spent all day running his hands through it. I knew him far too well.

He only took off his glasses when he was pissed or figured something out. I prayed for the latter.

For a British exchange student who exclusively wore sweater vests and spoke like a walking thesaurus, he was a prickly asshole. But he was also incredibly smart. Stupid smart.

“There was a line,” I lied, setting his (cold) coffee in front of him. 

In actuality, I had bumped into a group of “fans” who reminded me that we were useless. 

But of course I didn’t tell him that, instead offering Aris a smile and nudging his coffee toward him. 

I noticed his stance, furrowed brow, folded arms and leg jiggling, like he couldn’t wait to tell me something. Or maybe he just really had to pee.

It reminded me of when we first met, when we both signed up to edit the college newspaper; which was perhaps the only time I’d seen him smile. 

Aris only smiled when he had something tangible worth smiling about, which piqued my curiosity. I knew Aris like he knew me. Something was bothering him. 

And naturally, that asshole had wanted to wait for me to come back to gauge my reaction in person, instead of texting me a goddamn heads up.

I sipped my coffee while I tried my best to psychoanalyze him.

“You haven’t found them,” I hummed around the rim of my coffee cup. Ugh. The coffee tasted like burnt mildew. “But you’re getting closer?”

Aris simply cocked an eyebrow and turned his laptop around. I peered at the screen, a photo of a group of smiling kids.

It was an article from 2013 detailing Middleview’s Boy Scouts raising money for town hall renovations.

“Boy Scouts?” I murmured, leaning closer. I shot him an eyebrow right back. “Dude, I’m too tired to understand your brain.”

Aris’s lips pricked. “The cops said the guys had no connection,” he rolled his eyes.

He leaned forward and prodded the screen. “But, as you can see, both of them were in the 2013 Boy Scouts.” Aris traced the faces of the missing boys. 

“Which means, at some point, both of these boys have visited a Middleview resident.” He grabbed a printout and slapped it down in front of me. “They did these bake sales every year.” He explained. “I bet their kidnapper bought cookies from them.”

I scanned the article. “Hmm. So, the kidnapper targeted former Boy Scouts they bought cookies from?”

Aris shook his head, rocking back in his chair. His eyes found the ceiling. “I’m not there yet, Nancy Drew. May is pinpointing every resident who was a regular.”

My head jerked up. “You’re not serious.”

“If they bought cookies, we’re visiting them,” Aris muttered, massaging his temples like *he* was the one with a headache.

He groaned, tipping his head back and pinching between his brows. “What be their motive, though? That is what is so… logically indefensible.”

“It’s late, Aris,” I whined. “Can you please be NORMAL, for once?”

I mulled the information around in my head, kneeling uncomfortably on the cold wood floor in front of the desk.

No chairs, no beanbags. I drained my coffee as Aris sipped his own, made a face, and plonked his back down.  “But, why wait years to take them?” I pondered.  

“Why wait until they grew up?”

“Loneliness!”

An all-too-familiar voice startled me. Aris, as usual, was unperturbed, leaning further back in his chair.

May Lee, our third and final member, stuck her head through the door, bright orange hair igniting under the light. 

Korean American with the look of a runway model, May did not fit with us. 

That’s what I thought, at least. 

Don’t judge a book by its cover. 

When she showed up at our door donning a strawberry purse, skater dress, and a full notebook of suspects for our missing statue case, I couldn't take her seriously. 

Neither could Aris. In fact, our very own Sam Spade told her to fuck off. 

That was, until we found ourselves tied up in an old man’s basement, and it was that girl with the kitten heels who saved us from becoming Middleview’s next mystery.

But now, normally talkative May was strangely silent as she squeezed through the door. 

I took a moment to notice May was in pajamas, her hair still wrapped up in a towel. 

She held up her phone. “I’ve been on the phone with the former Boy Scout leader, and after a slight maybe-bribe, he gave me all of his customers' names. Past and present. And there were a lot of people.”

Aris raised a brow. “What did you bribe him with, may I ask?”

“That’s not important right now,” she rolled her eyes, speaking in a tangled rush of what I liked to call May Babble. “Anyway, to cut a long story short, after going through each customer, there was only ever one person who bought cookies every year.” 

May’s eyes found mine. “Jenny Pearson. 56 years old. She spent thousands of dollars on them. Like, she was OBSESSED.”

I nodded slowly, picking up on her words. “So, this is revenge?” I said. “For shitty cookies?”

“Perhaps they poisoned her?” Aris offered, cupping his chin. “Boy scout cookies are unfavorably mundane.”

May shook her head. “No. You've both been looking at this case from a perspective of malice. Jenny lost both of her teenage sons a year ago in a car crash,” she said. “Both of whom—”

Aris jumped up, his eyes wide. “Would be nineteen right now.”

May nodded grimly, folding her arms across strawberry-themed pajamas. 

“Loneliness,” she reiterated. “This woman lost her sons. So, what if she took two boys who were just like them? Two boys, whom she knew. Who she’d been buying cookies from since they were little kids.”

That would be the moment when any other trio of ragtag college detectives would… I don’t know, call the cops?

But this was our last chance to prove ourselves, a real kidnapping case with an actual criminal.

We’d spent our freshman year dealing with catnapping and missing statues, and this was an actual crime.

May insisted she was a lonely woman who was grieving, but there was a big difference between healthy grieving and kidnapping two nineteen-year-olds to replace her sons. It only took one look between us, and we were falling out of our closet-office faster than May could call us an Uber. 

Taking two steps down the stairs at a time, Aris was already ordering us around. 

“May, what’s the address?” he panted as we pushed through automatic doors and into the moonlit night.

Our Uber was already there, waiting. Aris jumped into the back, and I squeezed in beside him. 

He was already buzzing with excitement, almost vibrating in his seat, so much that May elbowed him. “Marin. I need the boys' names,” he said, snapping his fingers.

I pulled out my notebook, scanning my barely cohesive shorthand, grateful for the orangeade glow of passing lampposts.

“Prestley,” I said, squinting at the names. “Prestley and Beck.”

Aris’s head shot up. “Where have I heard that name before? Beck.”

His question hovered in the air like spoiled milk during a ten-minute drive where I was sweating, far too aware that we were actively interfering with a police investigation. 

Would this go on my permanent record? 

Mom made it pretty clear when I was hauled into the station for the third time that it would be the last time she would bail me out. 

The cops said this was our last chance—the next time we were caught, the three of us would be tried as adults. 

In my excitement, I kind of forgot about that part.  

A quick glance at Aris Caine, my partner in crime, whose expression was set in cartoonish determination, and I bit back a groan. 

Suddenly, the idea of confronting an actual kidnapper wasn’t such a good idea.

Once the adrenaline and dopamine rush had crashed and burned, I was left nauseous, and actually really fucking terrified I was going to die. My clammy hands dipped into my lap.

To distract myself, I stared out the window, watching the late-night traffic zip by in an aurora of cyberpunk colors. `

When we pulled up outside a regular suburban home, I really started rethinking my life choices.

Aris tilted his head, his eyes fixed on the “welcome home!” sign on the front door. 

He shoved his hands into his jacket pockets. 

Aris was the only one dressed appropriately for the occasion, in a sensible fur-coated jacket. It wasn’t a secret that his family was wealthy, but Aris wasn’t one to brag. 

“I was expecting a house of horrors,” he hummed. “This place belongs in a Hallmark movie.”

May, shivering and jumping up and down in her pajamas, nudged him. “Hallmark horror movies exist, y’know.”

“Let’s think about this,” Aris said, as it became clear we were just three college kids completely out of our depth standing on a random suburban street at 1am.

I dazedly watched my breath dance in front of me in white wisps.

Aris stared at Jenny Pearson’s house across the street. He was doing that thing again where he calculated everything in his mind, every possible escape route and every obstacle.

After a full minute of zoning out, swaying back and forth, and most importantly, not speaking, he finally turned to us. 

Aris had a plan. But from the look on his face, we were not going to like it. 

“I think I’ve got it,” he said. 

“So this woman kidnaps guys like her sons, right?” he hissed excitedly, zipping up his jacket. 

“So, I’ll knock and innocently ask if I can use her phone, she lets me in, and…bingo. I search the place, grab the guys, drag them out of the murder house, and we all go and grab coffee together.”

His grin was typical. 

Of course, Aris Caine was putting himself in unnecessary danger. He was just that kind of guy.

I already hated his plan.

May, of course, was against it.

“Are you serious?” she hissed. “You want to intentionally get kidnapped to prove she’s the kidnapper?” She rolled her eyes, “or we could just go over like three normal people and *ask* her.”

Aris laughed loudly. 

We were already attracting unwanted attention just by standing there. 

I shot him a warning glare, but of course he kept going because Aris Caine had to be right. 

“Oh, sure, that won’t ring any alarm bells.” Aris’s accent thickened with sarcasm. 

“Hi, lady! Sorry to bother you,” he said, mocking May’s squeaky voice. I bit my lip to hold back a smirk. “But are you keeping two nineteen-year-old students captive?” 

He turned to May, his lips curling. “I’m sure Mrs. Pearson will be completely honest with us.”

“I don’t sound like that,” May muttered.

“I know,” he sent her a rare teasing smile. “I was exaggerating for comedic effect.” 

Aris sighed. “Look, I know you don’t like it, but it looks less suspicious than three well-known detectives turning up.” He coughed. “I can also do a passable American accent that she’ll totally believe.”

“And what if *you* are taken too?” I hissed, blowing into my hands to keep them warm. “We have zero idea what state these guys are in and what she’s done to them—” I caught myself before I could let my emotions get the better of me. 

But they always won. “What if they’re dead?” I caught Aris’s raised eyebrow. “Even worse, what if she’s torturing them, like right now?”

Aris shot me a look. He folded his arms. “Marin, she’s a fifty-year-old mother,” he said, “not exactly Hannibal Lecter.”

“May I remind you both that Hannibal Lecter was really polite?” May hissed, hugging me for warmth. “Serial killers are actually known to be super chill! He ate with a handkerchief!”

Aris’s lip quirked. “You mean the *fictional* cannibal, Hannibal Lecter?”

May squeaked. “That’s not—”

“Yes it is,” he mused. “You’re talking about the TV show.”

“Shut up,” I hissed, noticing a window flicker behind us. The owner was watching. 

Which meant we had to make a decision.

I turned to Aris, a bad feeling already writhing in my gut. I had a choice. 

Let Aris sacrifice himself or get us all arrested. “Ten minutes,” I told him. “If you’re in there for a second longer, we’ll call the police, and all three of us are fucked.” Unable to stop my wandering hands, I fiddled with his hair in an attempt to hide his face. 

Aris squirmed, batting my hands away. Two months since we broke up; since I said we weren’t working.

He cared more about solving cases than about me. But that was okay because so did I. 

We were both stubborn, inexperienced introverts with a shared obsession with solving mysteries.

Of course we didn’t work. Opposites attract, but Aris and I repelled.  

Still, I cared for him more than I should.

I tucked a talkie into his pocket. “Use this when you can,” I said. “Don’t bother with pleasantries, and whatever you do, don’t accept any food or drink.”

“If she has weapons or you suspect any weird shit, get out of there,” May said, slapping him on the back.

“Relax,” Aris wasn’t a hugger, but he did bury his head in my shoulder. 

I appreciated his warmth, his proximity, which meant he was actually *trying*, his shuddery breaths dancing across the nape of my neck. I wanted him to stay longer before he pulled away and offered a two-fingered salute. “I’ll be fine!” he insisted. “I *promise* I won’t become a pod person.”

“Ten minutes,” I hissed before he darted across the road.

I couldn’t resist jumping to my feet. “Say it, Aris!” I whispered. “Ten minutes!”

“Ten minutes!” he hissed back, twisting around, his eyes sharp, lips curled. “Hide!”

I grabbed May, pulling her safely behind a car with me. I watched from a distance, scrutinizing every facial expression when the front door opened, revealing a middle-aged woman sticking her head out—purple hair and a bright green knitted sweater. 

Not what I was expecting. 

The woman didn’t seem defensive or suspicious, settling Aris with a warm smile. She didn’t *look* like a criminal mastermind. May passed me a pair of binoculars, and I focused on her facial expressions. Looking behind her, all I saw was a painting on the wall.

Aris stayed calm and collected, delivering his lines exactly as we rehearsed them. 

“Hi, I’m sorry to bother you, but I’m pretty lost. Can I use your phone to call someone? Mine is dead.”

Jenny Pearson’s lips broke out into a grin, and I caught May’s side-eye. She must have thought it was Christmas.

“Oh, of course!” Jenny Pearson sang, and my hands grew clammy around the binoculars. “Do you have any friends with you?”

Fuck.

May let out a hiss next to me. I wasn’t expecting that.

Neither was Aris, judging by his response. “Uh, no,” he said, maintaining his performance.  “No, it’s just me.”

“Well, come on in, sweetheart!” she said. “You can use my landline!”

“Do people even use landlines anymore?” May whispered. “It’s not the 90’s.”

Before I could respond, Jenny ushered Aris through the door and slammed it behind her, sending my heart into acrobatics.

Twenty minutes passed.

“He said ten minutes,” I gritted out. I jumped up, and she gently dragged me back down.

“Give him time,” May said, focusing on the upstairs, while I was glued to the door, mentally praying for the damned thing to fly open and for my idiot ex-boyfriend to come running out, two disheveled guys in tow. “Come on. Wasn’t that what broke you up? You didn’t *trust* each other.” 

She sighed. “You were cute. It sucks that both of you are insufferable.”

“I’m not stubborn,” I lied, exasperated. “He just sucked at being a boyfriend.”

May chuckled. “Which went both ways, you know,” she teased. “You also sucked at being a *girlfriend*.” She turned to me, grinning. “Didn’t you blow him off twice to go solo investigating?”

A warm rush of heat flooded my cheeks. “He did exactly the same thing to me,” I said.”

“Sooo, relationships are a competitive sport now?” May’s judgmental stare was burning a hole in my temple. “Aris scored a touchdown, and you played dirty, tackling him. You didn’t even give him a chance to reclaim the ball, didn't even explain your tackle, and you're both playing for the same team.”

“Sports metaphors?” I hissed, rubbing my eyes.

The Pearson door stayed shut. 

The welcome home sign on the door was beginning to look less like a greeting and more like a threat. “Sports metaphors that don’t even make sense in the middle of a life-or-death situation?”

May groaned. “I feel like my fingers are going to drop off and my butt is numb, so naturally, my brain is a mashed potato right now.” She sighed, adjusting her position to a light crouch.  “Anyway. Aris didn’t mean to blow you off.”

Something visceral erupted in my gut, twisting down my spine, the phantom legs of a spider scuttling along my vertebrae. 

And for a moment, I forgot about the Pearson house, the missing boys, and our stakeout. I twisted to May, my cheeks burning, my tongue in knots. “What?”

“He didn’t mean to blow you off,” May turned back toward the house. 

“That night, when you were on your date, I stupidly decided to confront the idiot who stole the town statue. I had all the evidence, but I didn’t tell you guys because I…” she trailed off. “Let’s just say he’s done this before.” 

She shuffled uncomfortably. “I went over to his dorm room, and after freaking out, he locked me inside.” 

May’s voice cracked. “I called Aris, who was on his way to meet you, and he came straight away.” She sniffled, swiping her nose. “It's dusty out here or something, stupid allergies.”

My voice came out tangled and wrong, suffocating my tongue. “Why didn’t he *tell* me?”

“I told him not to,” she whispered. “I was embarrassed. I didn’t want you to think I was reckless, and at first, he refused because he knew it would look bad. But I managed to convince him.” 

Her lip curled. “I’m actually still doing homework for him. That was part of our deal.”

I found myself laughing, but my heart hurt. I blew him off for nothing. I was unnecessarily cruel for nothing. “You’re both idiots.”

May spun around. “Soo, you’ll talk to him?”

I wasn’t sure if *talk* was the right word.

Maybe *scream*.

“Yeah,” I said, my chest aching. “Yeah, I’ll talk to him. But this doesn’t change anything. He fucks with mysteries, not people,” I couldn’t resist laughing. ""That guy gets off by solving cases. Do you know how many times we had sex? Zero.” 

I rolled my eyes. “Any time we were close, he’d get this weird look in his eyes, and say, 'Holy shit, I’ve got it!' like, he literally had his lightbulb moment right in the middle of making out.”

May burst into giggles. “That’s adorable.” She nudged me. “You loved it, though.” Her smirk caught me off guard. “You still like our boy, don’t you?”

“I don’t,” I said.

I did.

After half an hour, I started to lose circulation in my legs from crouching in the same spot.

Once the forty-five-minute mark had passed, I noticed the upper bedroom window’s curtains were suddenly pulled closed.

May nudged me, still peering through her binoculars. “Do you think we’re wrong?” she whispered. “What if she’s a grieving mother who just happens to like Boy Scout cookies?”

I didn’t take my eyes off the window. “If she’s just lost her sons, why is she closing the curtains to one of their rooms?” I said, “She lives alone, why bother?”

May shrugged. “She still tends to their rooms?”

“Nope,” I muttered, focusing on the front door. My heart started to stumble. “If I were a kidnapper and I just took another victim, the first thing I would do is make sure I have privacy.”

When an hour passed, panic began to creep in.

My hands were numb, my body stiff.  I stood to stretch my legs. I was starting to get restless. “If he’s not out in the next ten minutes, I’m knocking.”

Ten agonizing minutes passed quickly, and I finally stood up, my heart trying to burst from my chest. 

I marched over to the door, May by my side.

“Is this a good idea?” she hissed while I rapped on the door. “Shouldn’t we call the police?”

I jumped back in surprise as the door was yanked open.

“It’s quarter past three in the morning,” Jenny Pearson,  wrapped in a red robe, had a completely different reaction to us. “What on earth do you think you’re doing?”

I had half a mind to shove past her and see for myself. That’s what the cops would do.

Luckily, I had *some* self control.

“Hi there!” I smiled my best smile, trying to look past her. Mrs. Pearson blocked my way. 

“We’re Aris’s friends!” I said brightly. “We were just wondering where he is! He told us he’d be at this address, since his phone died.” 

The second Jenny Pearson’s expression crumpled with faux confusion, I knew this woman was the kidnapper, and she had just added my ex-boyfriend to her ranks of newly adopted sons. “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Jenny said. “Goodnight.”

Before she could slam the door on our faces, I tried to barge past her. 

“Let me rephrase myself,” I said. “You have kidnapped two students and just took our friend. We literally watched you welcome him inside your house.” When her expression soured, I smiled, closing the distance between us. “Open the fucking door, or I will *make* you open the fucking door.” 

Jenny’s eyes narrowed, and I knew what she was trying to do. Classic emotional manipulation.

Suddenly, she burst into loud, obvious sobs, trying to draw attention.

“My sons died three years ago,” she whispered. “I live *alone*, if you must know.” 

She emphasized *alone* before delivering the final blow. “Trespassing on my property and demanding to be let in is disgusting. Leave me alone, or I will be forced to call the police.”

May pulled out her phone with a sugary sweet smile. “It’s cool, I already called them,” she said. “They’re on their way.” She stepped forward, feigning innocence. “Mrs Pearson, I know you can’t let us check your home, but I’m sure you’ll let the cops, right?”

She stepped back just as a vivid array of red and blue lights arrived. Two police cars pulled up, one transporting my least favorite officer, Detective Henderson. 

I could already sense his death glare burning a hole in my skull.

But surprisingly, instead of ripping my head off, he turned to a frazzled-looking Mrs. Pearson. 

“Ma’am,” he croaked. 

I could tell he’d just woken up. Sleeping on the job, as per usual. “We’ve got a report of a domestic disturbance. Now, while we’re sure everything is *fine*,” he shot me a seething look, “we were issued a search warrant for this property based upon certain *allegations* made.”

“But—” Mrs Pearson’s protest crumbled when Officer Henderson pushed past her, gesturing the others to follow him.

May and I tried to push our way in, too, but of course, he shoved us back outside. “You two.” He gritted out. “Stay.”

I didn’t realize I was feverishly trying to force my way through an officer’s human barricade until I choked on a sob.

Henderson immediately backed down. He grabbed my shoulders gently. “Hey,” he spoke softly. “What’s going on?”

“Aris is in there!” I managed to get out. “She took him.” 

Suddenly, I was babbling; I couldn’t stop myself. “She’s kidnapping students who are the same age as her dead sons. Beck and Prestley were Boy Scouts when they were kids, and Aris…” I trailed off when he raised a brow.

“He’s the same age as the boys,” I said quickly. “So, naturally, she would go for him too.”

“Uh-huh.” Henderson dragged a hand over his face. We were already on thin ice with him. “And what exactly was Aris doing here in the middle of the night?”

I averted my gaze, avoiding his death-stare. May spoke up, her voice tangled in May-babble.  “Well, there was only one way to figure out if the boys are here—”

Henderson let out a frustrated hiss. “The only way to find out legally is to tell the police!”

When I tried to protest, he spun around. “Marin.” Officer Henderson spoke my name through clenched teeth, as if I were venom under his tongue.

“If this turns out to be nothing, you’re screwed. I’m not just talking about arrest; I mean, I will be personally sending the three of you to a juvenile detention center. Trespassing inside a police station, attempting to steal evidence, and now forced entry?” 

May grabbed my hand, squeezing tight. 

“It’s okay,” she whispered, leaning her head on my shoulder. “He’s okay.” 

But after a full hour of searching, even she was trembling against me.

Henderson finally came out for the final time.

“There’s nothing here,” he announced, and I felt my heart drop into my gut. I lunged forward.

May tried to pull me back, but I shoved her away, my face burning, my hands shaking. I was going to throw up.

“What are you talking about?” I demanded. People were watching, and I was screaming. I was the fucking crazy girl, the unhinged junior detective. “We watched him walk inside three hours ago!”

“She’s right,” May said, her voice teetering on the edge of hysteria. “Aris was here! She let him in!” 

She turned to Mrs Pearson, who was playing the victim act. “You hid them, didn’t you?”

The woman shook her head. “Sweetie, I’m very sorry, but I do not know where your friend is.”

“Then you can check doorbell cameras!” May hissed. “You can do that, right? Someone must have recorded Aris standing there!”

“I’m sure these two are just confused,” Henderson gritted out. “I’ll deal with you two in a minute.” He nodded to Mrs Pearson.

“Apologies for waking you up, ma’am. You have a blessed night, all right?”

No.

Ignoring the flood of officers bleeding out the door, I grabbed May’s hand and dragged her around to the back door.

I couldn’t breathe, my vision was blurry, and my head was spinning around and around. He had to be here, I thought dizzily. He fucking had to be. 

Because what if he *wasn’t*?

May was breathless at my side,  her wide eyes searching.

“You check upstairs,” she hissed to me, diving into the kitchen.

Then the lounge. I surged down the hallway, throwing myself upstairs. I checked each room. 

Empty. Frozen in time. Superhero posters and SAT revision books scattered the floor.

I stood frozen in the doorway, my gaze glued to a photo on the nightstand: a smiling blonde boy with his arms wrapped around a brunette boy.

My breath was sucked from my lungs. 

I blinked rapidly, but it was still there. Aris. I didn’t recognize the brunette, but the two of them wore wide grins, like they knew each other. 

Like they were friends. 

More so, this was a photo of nineteen-year-old Aris. Maybe even older.

Early twenties, judging by his slight stubble.

But how was that possible?

I stumbled forward on shaky legs, reaching for the photo.

“Marin!” May cried from downstairs.

Somehow, I forced my legs to move, stumbling back down the stairs with the photo frame pressed to my chest. I met a panting May halfway, who didn’t speak, only holding something up.

The talkie I’d pushed into Aris’s pocket.

May’s cheeks were sickeningly pale. 

“It was in the kitchen, smashed under the table,” she whispered. Her gaze snapped to the photo frame in my arms. “Are they the sons who died?”

Her words felt like pinpricks. 

“What? No!” I held up the photo. “It’s Aris!” I hissed. “I mean, it’s an older version of him!”

May frowned. “That’s not Aris,” she whispered. “Marin, I’m pretty sure they’re her dead sons.”

“What the hell do you think you’re doing?!” Mrs. Pearson snatched the photo frame from me, and I caught another glance.

Two smiling boys with their arms wrapped around each other, and definitely not a twenty-something-year-old Aris.

“Get out.” Mrs. Pearson spoke through a shuddering breath. 

She snatched the talkie from May. 

“Get out of my house, now!” she screamed, and we were immediately grabbed by officers on standby. “Disrespecting me is one thing, but going through my dead children’s belongings?”

There she goes again with the manipulation tactic.

We had no choice. Not even the argument of “That’s Aris’s talkie” would win over Officer Henderson.

She threw us out of the front door and into the waiting arms of the nearest cop. Then, we were unceremoniously shoved into the back of my favorite policeman’s cruiser.

May was deathly silent while Henderson lounged in the front seat on his phone. 

I leaned over, restless, my heart suffocating in my throat. 

“Our friend is *missing*,” I spoke through my teeth.  “Are you going to fucking *do* something? Because the last time I checked, cops actually do their *jobs*.”

Henderson, as if mocking me, pulled out his notebook, coughing loudly. “Oh, you want me to write a report?”

I resisted the urge to yell. 

Henderson was one of the more tolerable officers who actually spoke to us. But he was still a cop.

“Yes,” I whispered. “I’m officially reporting him missing.”  

Henderson chuckled. “All right!” He held up a fake pen, pulling off a fake lid. 

“Aris Caine,” he pretended to jot down. “Let me see! Nineteen years old. Glasses. Short blonde hair. Reasonably bright. Attitude. Insufferably pretentious.” He chuckled, flipping over a page.

“Not a very good detective. Actively trespasses on police property, and oh, yeah, I forgot. Mr. Caine had already violated a police order at the time of his supposed *disappearance*. Which was when the three of you hatched a genius plan to break into the home of a grieving woman who lost two sons.” He pocketed his phone with a yawn.

“He’s in there,” I said, refusing to let my voice break. “I know he’s in there. She’s hiding them all.”

Henderson twisted around, staring me down. “And exactly where do you expect her to be keeping three adult men against their will?” He laughed. 

“Okay, so, let's just hypothetically say you’re correct,” Henderson mused, flipping through his notepad. “Jennifer Pearson is a kidnapper,” his lip curled. 

“Don’t you think they’d overpower her? You know, three youngsters versus a woman with confirmed bad hip problems.” 

He shrugged when May sent him a questioning look. “Mrs. Pearson isn’t well, physically,” he said. “I can assure you she does not have the upper body strength to restrain anyone in your hypothetical, made up, magical imaginary room.”

“You mean a basement,” I said dryly.

“It’s been a long night, kids,” he said, watching us closely in the mirror. 

“If your friend doesn't come back tomorrow, I’ll submit a report.” Henderson shut off the lights, and before I knew what was happening, we were cruising away from Mrs. Pearson’s house. Away from Aris.

I had an idea.

Not a good idea, but it was an *idea*.

“I’m going to throw up,” I said, lurching forward. 

“Officer Henderson, I’m—” I spat all over the seats and my lap, forcing very lifelike heaving sounds from my lungs. 

May squeaked, playing along, shuffling away from me with a wink. I tumbled out of the car and let him uncuff me. “Just let me throw up on the side of the road,” I pretended to sob. “I hate fucking throwing up in front of people, I can’t stand it, I---”

“Just go,” Henderson growled. “No funny business, alright? Go do your—whatever you need to do and come back. I gotta take you to the station and write up this fuckin’ report.”

I took the opportunity, nodding. “I’ll just be over there,” I hunched over, clutching my stomach. “Urghhh, I think I’ll be a while. I had this, like, really bad-tasting hot dog. And it’s both ends—""

“Just go! I don’t need details!” I stumbled off as Henderson pulled a face, shooting one last look at May who was biting back a grin.

May, thankfully, immediately worked as a distraction, erupting into a conversation about current affairs.

“So, Officer Henderson,” she mused loudly, “what do you think about Bitcoin?”

His response was a grunt. “What-coin?”

I ran, throwing myself into a sprint before Henderson could notice. Getting back to the Pearson house was easy.

It was getting *in* that would be the hard part. Just as I thought, Henderson pulled up five minutes later looking for me. I ducked behind a trash can. 

After pacing up and down the road for a whole ten minutes, he jumped into his car and sped off in a cloud of exhaust fumes.

Emerging from my hiding spot, I slunk towards the back again, sneaking up the driveway and pink-panthering my way over the wooden gate. 

The back door was locked now, of course. 

But I had a burned metal coil I found on the sidewalk, and a vague memory of my ex-boyfriend whispering, “When in doubt and faced with a locked door, anything will do.” After three frustrating attempts and almost throwing a brick through the damn window, the lock *snicked* open, and I crept inside, pulling out my phone to use as a flashlight.

The kitchen lit up in front of me. Empty. Minimalist. There was a single empty bowl on the table, and an empty cup.

I picked up an apple from the fruit bowl, rolling it around in my hand.

Fake.

I started toward the living room, my flashlight beam illuminating the hallway and staircase. 

“Aris?” I kept my voice a low whisper, ducking into the living room. “Aris, are you in here?”

The television was on, I noticed. The sound was muted, a flickering screen casting light across the room, playing a commercial.

Two shadowy figures sat in front of the television, TV dinners on their laps.

I recognised the tangle of blonde curls and his stupid sweater vest.

I rushed forward, my breath stuck in my throat, but I stopped when Aris’s voice froze me in place.

“Don’t come…” he heaved out a breath. “Don’t come any closer.”

“Is she here?” a gruff voice split through the silence. The second figure was a towering brunette sitting stiffly. I knew him.

From the photo.

And the article.

Prestley. One of the missing boys.

“Yes,” Aris whispered to the boy. “Just… don’t say anything…” his voice was strained, and I couldn’t understand why. Moving closer, the way he was sitting sent shivers trickling down my spine. 

He was upright, but his head lolled onto his shoulder, wide, frightened eyes glued forward. 

“Stupid.”

He jerked suddenly, a cry escaping his lips. “We’ve got maybe five minutes.”

I found my voice. “I’m getting both of you out of here. Whatever she’s done to you—”

I stopped when I saw the back of him, saw his hollowed-out skull. 

Not just his head. 

His entire torso was nothing, just flesh and bone bound together. 

I reached forward to run my hands through his hair, but it was all strings, bloody scarlet slicked string.

“Saffron,” Prestley growled. “That’s the code-word. Tell her before they wipe her again.”

“Eve,” Aris whispered as I staggered back, tripping over myself. “There is no Jenny Pearson, this house—this stage—is empty right now.”

His voice collapsed into white noise, synchronizing with my screams.

“Just… listen to me, okay? Don’t freak out. Listen. When the time comes, you need to remember, all right? Saffron, Eve. You need to remember it.”

But I couldn’t listen.

I couldn’t breathe.

I couldn't stop screaming, blood all over my hands, bloody strings tangled between my fingers—

…

I woke up inside our office closet.

“Hey.”

The voice startled me awake, my head snapping up off our only laptop. I could feel the indentations of the keys pressed into my cheeks. Aris Caine eyed me as I groggily wiped the drool from my lips. 

He stood in front of me, a pensive expression on his face that softened into a tender, somewhat genuine, rare half-smile. 

“Thanks for yesterday,” he fumbled with his hair. “For saving me, or whatever.”

He cleared his throat, taking my hand and running his fingers through my hair, sending shivers up my spine. He leaned closer, his breath tickling the nape of my neck. “I miss us. You know that, right?”

Somehow, we worked like clockwork. I stood and let him sit down, straddling my lap. 

“But I guess you didn’t want me, after all…”

Aris pulled away with a sigh, and I tugged at his hair playfully, forcing his face back to mine. 

His lips found my ear, warm breath tickling the back of my neck. I shivered. 

“I’m *sorry*,” I said, breathless, “was that Aris Caine’s way of *thanking* me?”

Aris chuckled. “It's my way of saying I've been a shitty boyfriend, and being tied up with Prestley for seven hours made me rethink certain *choices*.” 

He kissed me, and I kissed back, warmth spreading through me. “Such as?” I whispered.

He rolled his eyes, adjusting himself on my lap. “Well, next time, I’ll try not to get kidnapped by a psycho.”

A sudden knock on our closet-office door made me jump, sending Aris sprawling. I dived to my feet, straightening my blouse. “Fuck. Is that a client?”

Aris tipped his head back with a groan. “Nope. *Worse*.”

“I know you’re in here,” a voice said from outside.

“Come in,” I said, ignoring Aris’s side-eye. 

The door flung open, a mousy head of reddish-brown curls sticking his head through.

Noah Prestley. The guy we saved, along with Beck and Aris. 

Ever since we pulled him out of that house, the guy was obsessed with us. 

He pulled out his notebook, letterman jacket sliding off one shoulder. “Okay, so I know you guys said you’re not recruiting, but I have like, a ton of possible cases—”

Noah stopped suddenly, his expression going slack. 

He dropped the notepad and slammed the door shut. 

“Saffron?” he whispered to Aris, who nodded, his eyes suddenly dark. 

Glassy. 

I could barely recognize them.

“Saffron.” Aris turned to me with wide eyes, and something cold crept down my spine, my nerve endings igniting. 

He stepped in front of me and gently took my hands, squeezing them, his eyes pleading.

1qcad2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/plassing/comments/1qcad2i/just_got_cleared_on_my_first_go_for_the_first/,Just got cleared on my first go for the first time ever!,"Just wanted to share this positive story because I know a lot of people struggle with this issue and you can get out. I’ve struggled with my heart rate being high while trying to donate for a long time. I’ve never once passed the vitals station first try. 

I tried deep breathing, water, the vasalva manuever, calm music, a vaso dialator, magnesium, almost everything but was denied close to every time I went. I almost hung up my hat. On my last try last year I basically had a tantrum in my dorm because of it, cried, punched myself and a pillow in the head, threw my glasses across the room, type of thing that I rarely do in the present day. I took a break for a few weeks because of the holidays. I slept a bunch and went to a convention. 

Today was the last day of my donation cycle. I knew I had to donate to keep my donor level. I slept close to 12 hours, drank a coffee and redbull at 12pm and was afraid that it might disqualify me. I’m also on my period so was worried about iron issues as well because I donated one day before my cycle once and it was low. Lost my stanley and was drinking from a 64 oz motivational bottle today. Drank down to the 7 pm mark.

I decided to take a new approach. I wasn’t going to do deep breathing, take vasodilators, or anything, I was just going to come early and chill. 7 something I get on my scooter and arrive over 20 minutes early.  The nurses suggested that I do I sit down and listen to some binuaral beats. I drew some random shit with my pen. I suddenly  got the urge to pray the rosary but I couldn’t find my favorite version. I checked my heart rate a few times with my fingers and it seemed ok. Stood up and filled out the questionnaire. 

Finally, I was in line and I started saying a rosary from memory. Told myself many times that I was going to make it. Got to vitals and the finger prick hurt about half as much as normal and they only took like a sixth of a stick of blood for it. I could feel a peak in heart rate. As he put on the cuff I was a bit nervous but a voice in my head said “don’t worry, you’re going to make it, trust me” and I didn’t really believe it but decided to just sit still and chill, no weird breathing or anything. The man looked at it and moved on, usually they remark that my heart rate is pretty high so I knew what that meant. I responded internally to the voice I was initially incredulous of and told it, “wow you were actually right” and it said “I told you you would make it”. 

I’m donating 973 milliters right now. Turns out that my solution was simple. Come in and chill, the nurses had told me to do so since I usually ride my electric scooter a mile and a half to come. I had cut it a little close when coming to many times. I also think that overthinking was also an issue.  Also, my diet and sleep schedule was fucked last month as I was eating one mcdonald’s meal a day(my meal plan ended), staying up all night and sleeping during the day, locked in my small college dorm room, and barely moving. Also a lot of soda. 

Anyways, moral of the story is, don’t give up and chill. Your hr problem is probably mostly a mental problem, reassure yourself and think happy thoughts. Arrive early to the office to allow yourself to sit down. Leave your phone alone. Don’t think about the money or what you need it for. Only listen to calm music. Trying too hard makes your body respond accordingly. The solution is usually quite simple.

1qcacms,https://www.reddit.com/r/mixedrace/comments/1qcacms/the_way_the_us_views_the_racial_system_compared/,The way the US views the racial system compared to my country kind of shocked me a lot 🤯,"Okay, let's go! As stated in the title, I'm really shocked by how mixed-race people are viewed in the US. To give some context: I'm Pétala, a Brazilian girl. My father is white and my mother is of indigenous descent, but overall, I literally have black, white, indigenous, and Asian blood. Just imagine! 😆

Anyway, here in Brazil, a person being mixed-race is nothing new; basically everyone here is kind of ""mixed,"" so to speak. To explain: Brazil is the country with the greatest miscegenation in the world. We have the largest number of black people outside the African continent, the third largest number of white people, the largest number of Japanese people outside Japan, the largest number of Lebanese people outside Lebanon, and millions of descendants of native peoples.


Anyway, we are diverse, and there are people of all kinds here. In Brazil, I am considered brown (that is, mixed-race). White people don't consider me white, but they don't consider me Black either; Black people don't consider me Black, and depending on the person, some think I'm white, others think I'm Indigenous. In short, I'm literally ""café com leite"" (coffee with milk) and I don't care. Around here, being mixed-race isn't a big deal. 🤷‍♀️

But I was really shocked by something: I have a friend who lives in the US and we were talking about cultural differences. He told me that, in the US, anyone who doesn't have 100% European features and completely white relatives isn't considered white, regardless of how light their skin is. My head was like: ""🤯"". I found it really shocking.

In Brazil it's totally different. Here, almost everyone with light skin is perceived as white, regardless of whether any of their relatives aren't white or whether the person doesn't have European facial features. We take skin tone very much into account. I got curious and researched the reason for this difference in perspective between the US and Brazil.

I discovered that, in the US, during the segregation era, there was the ""one-drop rule"" to separate white people from non-white people. They used this to exclude anyone who wasn't purely white. In other words: if you had a Black father, a Latino relative, or Indigenous features, it didn't matter how light your skin was—even if it was literally white—they would separate you. This shaped the mentality and society to this day, even with the end of official segregation. I found that very crazy!

Talking to my friend, I realized that in the US ethnicity is still very present in society, along with its prejudices, and this shapes their identity. Of course, we have problems with racism here, but I feel the dynamic is different. Anyway, I just wanted to bring up this point of view and see other people's comments about it. Sorry for any mistakes and thank you for reading this far! 💜",18,1768355432.0,mixedrace,7,0.95,False
1qcac4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/iems/comments/1qcac4h/og_hype_4_tea_produnu_davinciaful_52_from_someone/,( OG ) Hype 4 >>>>>>>>>>>> Tea Pro/Dunu Davinci/Aful 5+2 (from someone who almost exclusively uses v high end).,"



I had the Hype 4 as my knock abouts as I don't take the others out of the house & someone offered me some CA Supermoon for the Hype 4 + a little cash... I wanted those for my Dad, so I did it. 

I wanted another knock around pair to replace them & sadly I wish I'd just bought the Hype 4 again. 

Aful 5+2 were absolutely the worst. I've heard there are significant differences between units, but mine sounded awful every time there was a heavy snare. Just a non descript, high end noise. Even reducing the treble using the DSP on my Mojo 2 (I don't EQ - if you need to go beyond slight adjustments of the mid high/upper high/mid low/sub low, you're using the wrong set). 

The Tea Pro were really disappointing. I really enjoyed the Tea 2, a long time ago - I'm unsure if I still would, as things have moved on a lot, but they really stood out back then. Not sure what those 2 DD's are actually doing because the bass is crap & the overall tonality is SHOCKING. 

The Dunu Davinci are the best of the bunch - and if that really is your dead set budget... certainly not terrible. If we're talking about this price bracket, which I admittedly don't have much knowledge of... but based on the others I've mentioned & a few more... they're the best ones I've tried. 

BUT the difference of what, $100?, to get the Hype 4 is a disproportionately enormous upgrade. They're good all rounders - especially if you have a Mojo 2 or if there's anything else similar... or EQ, you'll be able to use these for pretty much anything & they can go very basshead if you push the bottoms up - obviously I mean with no distortion. I dint think this is a subjective viewpoint; I think this is a very good cup of freshly ground coffee vs instant stuff level of better. 

They sound a lot better than a lot of much pricier sets - although personally not close to any of my pricier ones, but I can very happily listen to them & not feel I'm making a huge compromise - I can't say the same for the others, unfortunately. 

Do yourself a favour & put that extra bit towards something which is genuinely phenomenal value.

1qca8zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/aussie/comments/1qca8zf/if_the_problem_is_integration_what_are_australian/,"If the problem is integration, what are Australian fellows doing to encourage that?","I see a lot of debate on both sides, the ones who make an effort to integrate criticizing those who don't, and those who don't integrate, complaining that they prefer to stay in their own familiarized circles.

I'll give me perspective as someone who has lived in Australia for 6 years. I came here mainly to travel, unfortunately, due to COVID, those plans got postponed. I ended up deciding to stay, making friends along the way, and feeling like I wanted to explore more of the country. I have now settled, and I have had several friends over the years, lots of dear ones who moved overseas again or interstate, but it all narrows down to: I have 0 Australian friends. And my friends of friends also aren't friends with Australians.

I have tried, just like I've tried making friends with other nationalities. People from my country make 70% of my friends, and the other 30% are people from Europe, or South/North America. Part of it is also familiarity, it doesn't matter how much you like another country, your culture and upbringing will always be a part of you wherever you go. So I do enjoy having friends from my country and that will never change. However, I would love to be able to feel like I am not seen as an outsider every time I try to connect with an Australian just because I haven't known them for 10+ years.

My partner, who is half Australian, has been here since a child, so all of his friends are high school friends. So this became clear to me: you can make friends, as long as you don't move here after your 20s. This is another thing that I find odd about the culture here, everyone is in their 30s still asking/talking about what school you went to. I personally couldn't care less nor does it make me see you in a better or worse light. His friends, and their perspective partners, are all friendly. We can spend a whole afternoon talking. There is no interest whatsoever in meeting up with a coffee, going for a walk, having a dinner night etc. We only talk during social gatherings. They are not my friends, and they make it very clear when I see them catching up without me. The secret? They've been friends for 10+ years.

Now, I'm not saying everyone has to want to be friends with me or vice versa, but it does stick out to me that having conversations with other immigrants, this seems to be a common denominator.

I'm genuinely just trying to understand, from an Australian perspective, if the issue is not integrating, what are Australians doing to encourage immigrants to actually integrate? I get that it's probably ""part of the culture"" to stick with the friends you made during high school, but as ever changing country, it would be nice to see Australians be the change they want to see as well and leave those cultural habits behind. I get that most of the effort should come from the immigrant, but it's quite hard to feel that way, when being in another country is already vulnerable and often times difficult. In the end, we all want the same thing: to feel like a part of a community.

  
Edit: this post isn't about *me* or how to make friends. This post is about what Australians are doing to stop the lack of integration from immigrants. This is specifically targeted at those who complain immigrants don't integrate, yet seemingly do nothing about it. I know how to make friends, don't worry about me being pleasant or not, I'm not asking you to be my friend either. This is a debate without involving me as a person, hope that clears any confusion.

So I was out with a friend drinking some coffee and I told them that sometime during the day I’ll have to go to a store to buy some stuff. After saying that I thought of someone I barely know. I felt like I might actually see them in that store, but didn’t really pay attention to this feeling. Then  when I was at the store looking for stuff to buy the same feeling came again but this time stronger. I thought  “what if X walked into that store right now…”, so unconsciously I turned my head towards the entrance and looked over there for a few secs. I was zoning out and then BOOM X came in..! I turned my head back so fast lol. After a few mins we were really close to each other and made eye contact. Mind you that I started seeing them a few months ago and since then saw them like 2-3 more times. The first time before seeing them,I had dreamed of them. When I woke up I thought hmm Why lol and then said to myself if it means something I’ll see them in the waking world(again). Then the next day I thought I saw the person from my dream while getting some coffee(couldn’t see their face). Then a few days later I happened to see them at the exact same location from the other day where I wondered if I really saw them. Weird? You might think oh yeah well they might be your neighbour and you just didn’t pay attention to them, but your subconscious did and after the dream the conscious self started too. It’s rational BUT their face has been familiar to me for a while. I used to have a crush on them  like 5+ years ago, but only for a little while, because I moved out to a different city. Why have I not spoken to them yet? Im shy lol. I feel like I’m overthinking it and maybe it doesn’t mean anything, but the last synchronicity was… surreal? Is it possible that it has a meaning?

1qca1eg,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qca1eg/rf_my_final_creation/,[RF] My Final Creation,"Ellie walked home after a long day. She was drained from work, and wanted nothing more than to get home, turn on her TV, and kick up her feet. She’d been feeling emotionally spent for the last few weeks. When she got to her building, she noticed a package on the floor by the mailboxes. She quickly glanced at the label as she passed by, and was surprised to see that it was addressed to her. She looked closer at the label, and then froze. The sender was listed as Chris. Chris had died three weeks ago from a long fight with cancer. She had just gone to his funeral the week before. She stared at the package unmoving for what felt like hours, until finally, she reached for it. It was about the size of a toaster, and she was surprised by the weight of it. *There must be something dense in here,* she thought. She took a deep breath and began walking up to her apartment.

\--------------------------------

“Do you understand the material?” a man’s voice whispered. Ellie looked to her left.

“I think so,” she replied. “At least the part about vectors. Matrix multiplication, I’m not so sure of.”

“Actually, I understand that decently well, I think. My name’s Chris, by the way.”

“Ellie.” Ellie reached out her hand in response to Chris holding his out. “What building are you in? Maybe we should study later.”

“I’m in Mercury hall,” Chris replied.

“Me too!”

“I’ll be working on this stuff around 4 if you want to join. Maybe we can teach each other what we’re not so solid on.”

“That sounds great. I’ve been really struggling in this class.” Ellie gathered her things and left the lecture hall. A few hours later, back in her dorm building, she knocked on room 4C. The door opened.

“Chris?” she asked.

“Hey Ellie, come in.” Chris opened the door wide. The room had a futon, a table, and a lot of random stuff on every surface. Chris moved some things off the table so they could put their textbooks and pages of homework on it, and they began to work. After about an hour, they had finished the homework. She felt like both of them understood the material much better than before.

“You’re in my chemistry class too, right?” asked Chris.

“Oh yeah, with professor Johnson, right?” Ellie replied. Chris nodded.

“Are you ready for the quiz tomorrow?” he asked.

“Tomorrow? Wait, what’s today’s date?” she said as she scrambled for her watch.

“April 19^(th), 2011,” he said with a grin.

“Shoot! I forgot about it. I have to study.” She gathered her homework and her textbook, but suddenly she noticed something. “What’s that?” she asked.

“It’s a puzzle box,” he replied, picking it up off the table. “I love these things. I haven’t done this one yet, but it looks challenging.”

“Oh, I’ve done a few of those.” She squinted at it for a moment, then confidently said “This one doesn’t look too bad.” Chris grinned.

“Give it a shot,” he challenged. Ellie smirked and grabbed it from his hand. She carefully examined every surface, and began trying different ways of getting it open.

“Need some help?” ribbed Chris.

“Hang on, hang on. I’ve only had it ten seconds,” Ellie replied. She continued working on it with the occasional suggestion from Chris. Finally, after about fifteen minutes, it popped open in her hand. “We did it!” she exclaimed. Chris laughed.

“Hang on, I have something to commemorate this occasion.” He stood up and began rummaging around one of his shelves. He came back with an old instant camera.

“Does that thing work?” asked Ellie.

“Of course! It’s a real antique but I take care of it.” He sat back next to her and held the camera out facing both of them. “Smile!” he said just before the camera flashed. The camera began to print a picture out of the two of them sitting on the futon grinning, with Ellie holding up the opened puzzle box.

“I’ll be putting this in here,” said Chris as he grabbed the puzzle box from Ellie. He put the picture inside of it and reset the puzzle. “I get new ones all the time. Swing by if you want to study math and do a puzzle!”

Ellie grinned. “I will,” she said, and left to go back to her dorm to study for her chemistry quiz.

\--------------------------------

Ellie walked into her apartment and set the box down on her counter. She took off her jacket and her shoes, set her keys in the bowl, and grabbed the box, taking it with her to sit down on her couch. She grabbed a pen and used it to cut the box open. As she pulled back the flaps, a wooden box revealed itself to her. It had intricate designs on it, with panels, indentations, and protrusions on every surface she could see. She grinned and let out a quick chuckle, and took a moment to compose herself. She took it from the packaging and set it on her coffee table. *Alright, Chris*, she thought. *Let’s see what you’ve got.* Chris had clearly made this box – he was an amateur woodworker, only ever plying the craft to make puzzle boxes he gave to his friends or sold online on the side. The surfaces were a little rough, and not everything fit together perfectly. But if she knew Chris’s puzzles, this one would be tricky. Ellie spent time pushing on various panels and trying to move different sections. One panel would slide one way and back, but not seem to achieve anything. Then she pressed into a section and a drawer popped out just beneath it. *Ah-ha!* she thought as she pulled out the drawer. She looked in the cavity where the drawer was but saw nothing but smooth surfaces. Inside the drawer there appeared to be a small magnet. She pulled it out of the drawer. *This I can work with,* she thought as she continued trying various possibilities.

Ellie passed much of the rest of the evening trying to make progress on the box, but she didn’t have much to show for it. Just a few more panels and switches that led to nowhere. She resolved to get a good night’s sleep and pick up after work the next day.

Ellie worked as a manager at a local coffee shop. The work could be hectic and tiring, but she knew before she went in that day that it would be slow. The weather was nasty, and would be nasty all day. As she bundled up in her rain jacket and boots and walked out of her apartment, she took one more look at the puzzle box sitting on her coffee table.

Apart from the occasional spurt of activity, Ellie had been right about the coffee shop that day. She carried around a napkin on which she sketched various possibilities she hadn’t considered with the box. Between orders and tallying bean inventory she would visualize the box, the possibilities she’d tried, and what she’d learned. As her shift drew to a close, an idea suddenly came to her. *I haven’t tried –* She waved and said good night to Jimmy, the closer for the day, and hurried home, pulling her jacket closer as the wind whipped raindrops around her face.

Ellie pulled closed her apartment door and kicked off her boots, haphazardly hanging her rain jacket up and loosely tossing her keys in the bowl. She approached the box, staring at it as she did so. *If I remember right . . .* she thought as she grabbed the drawer she’d taken out the night before. She placed the magnet on top of the box where she knew another magnet was, and then pushed a panel that wouldn’t move unless the magnet was right there. Then she flipped the drawer upside-down and re-inserted it into the cavity it had come from. She felt a satisfying *click* as another drawer sprung open. “Yes!” she nearly shouted as she pulled this second drawer out. She looked at the bottom and saw a small golden key with a red ribbon tied around it. *A key, eh? Now I just have to find the key hole.*

Ellie put on her fluffy socks, made herself a bowl of mac and cheese, and put on her show, spending the evening casually playing with the box, trying possibilities, and learning more. She found a sequence that would let her rotate a circular panel that had a slot in it, and much to her surprise, the slot revealed half of a keyhole. *There!* she thought. *Now how do I reveal the rest of it?*

\--------------------------------

“How many does this make?” asked Chris.

“I think . . . eight?” replied Ellie as she set down the latest puzzle box the two of them had solved. “To be honest, the last couple have been a bit on the easy side.”

“Yeah,” replied Chris, “they used a lot of tropes we’ve already seen.” He paused for a moment. “You know, I used to do a little woodworking with my dad. I’ve got a couple ideas that would stump you.”

“You’ll make a puzzle box?” Ellie replied incredulously.

“Sure!” Chris replied. “Maybe it’ll be big and clunky, but a six pack of beer says it’ll be at least a little challenging.”

Ellie grinned. “You’re on.”

Two weeks later, Chris and Ellie finished another study session. Their semester was coming to a close, and both of them felt their math finals would be their biggest challenge. But they felt a lot more confident since they’d started studying together, each of them gravitating towards different parts of the subject, and filling in the other where they were weakest.

Chris sighed as he set his book down. “My brain’s fried,” he said.

“Mine too,” replied Ellie.

“Good.” He stood up and reached under his bed. He pulled out a splintery wooden box that was nailed together and the size of a microwave, setting it on his table in front of Ellie.

“What . . . is this?” Ellie said, a grin spreading across her face. “I can fit my finger through here!”

“Well don’t! I haven’t done this in years. Anyway, your clock starts now.”

Ellie broke into a laughing fit before taking a serious look at the box. She tried to rotate it but it made a strange grinding sound on the table, which caused her to succumb to another laughing fit. Chris smiled and went to the fridge for a beer.

“Where’s mine?” Ellie asked.

“You gotta earn it,” replied Chris.

“Well, I’m pretty sure I just did.” Ellie stuck her pen in a gap between two slats and disengaged a locking mechanism, causing one of the sides to fall off of the box.

“Hey, that’s cheating!” protested Chris.

“The box was locked. Now it’s open. Where’s my beer?”

\--------------------------------

Ellie had the day off. Good day for it too, since the weather report was sunshine and warm breezes. She had been unsuccessful the evening before in making much progress on the keyhole, and decided she’d go for a walk to clear her mind and try to get some ideas flowing. She grabbed a small notebook that fit in her purse and a pen, and walked out the door.

She headed for the local park, a place where she would frequently go for runs or picnics. After meandering for some time, loosely thinking about the box, she wandered close to a cart that was selling coffee. She approached it and bought a cup. She took a deep breath, getting the aroma of her coffee, the fresh air, and gentle scent of plant life on the breeze. The sky was a vivid, rich blue, with just a few streaks of clouds accentuating it. She strolled with her coffee to a small table on the side of the path and sat down. She pulled out her notebook and her pen and began doodling ideas on how to reveal the rest of the keyhole.

After she had finished about a third of her coffee and scratched several diagrams on her notebook, a woman came down the path with a child in tow. The woman’s child, a daughter, held a flower in her hand and was happily skipping along, looking at the various flowers on the side of the path. When they neared Ellie, the girl stooped over and picked a vibrant purple flower. “Look!” she said as she held it up for her mother. She closed her eyes and began spinning, holding her two flowers in each hand.

“Watch out!” said the mother as the girl’s spinning hand struck Ellie’s coffee. The coffee spilled over Ellie’s notebook, covering her diagrams of the box. “Oh, I’m so sorry!” said the mother as she pulled her daughter away from Ellie. Ellie scrambled to shake coffee off of her notebook, but the diagrams were ruined. The girl stood still, looking at Ellie with her hands by her mouth.

“I’m sorry,” she said.

“It’s alright. I know you didn’t mean to,” replied Ellie.

“You have to be more careful!” scolded the mother as she pulled her daughter along.

Ellie looked down at her notebook and the ruined diagrams. She was stumped. She leaned back and looked at the sky.

\--------------------------------

“I feel ridiculous,” said Chris as he took off his cap. His blue gown flapped gently in the wind.

“I feel like I can’t believe we survived,” replied Ellie as she took hers off as well. Family members, friends, and classmates bustled around them as they left the auditorium and went to their cars. Ellie and Chris stood near a parking lot where Chris had parked.

“I know. That math class was no joke,” said Chris. “Oh hey, before you go, I have something for you.” Chris jogged to his car and popped the trunk. He grabbed something and jogged back. “No pen will fit in this one,” he said, grinning as he handed Ellie a smaller, more refined puzzle box. Ellie smiled and gave it a quick once over.

“Nope, I think you’ve worked out that little bug.”

The two of them stood in silence for a moment.

“Well, my parents are taking me to a restaurant to celebrate. I think a lot of drinks will be involved,” said Chris.

“Funny, mine told me to go home and start studying for my grad program,” Ellie responded. Chris laughed.

“I know we’re heading down different paths now. But if you send me your address, I’ll send you a puzzle box every now and then. Every one’s a little bit trickier than the last!” said Chris.

“Deal,” replied Ellie.

\--------------------------------

Ellie placed her coffee-soaked notebook and her pen back in her purse, and stood up. *He might’ve gotten me this time,* she thought. She began walking slowly home. Her mind began to wander, the feeling of walking and of the sun on her skin inducing a state of pleasant ease. She walked by people, plants, dogs, buildings. Then she felt a nagging idea arise. She froze. *What if I –* And with that she began a brisk walk back to her apartment. When she got to her building, she took the stairs two at a time. She practically kicked off her shoes and staggered to her couch. Her breath came at a rapid pace as she pulled one drawer out and stuck her magnet at a specific point. She began rotating the circular panel, when there was a sudden *pop* and it flew off, clattering to the floor. She sat up and looked at the now fully exposed keyhole. She froze and stayed still for a moment. Then she grabbed the key with the red ribbon and slowly inserted it into the hole. She rotated it and heard the *click* of the final lock opening. The whole front of the box opened. She held the box up and tilted it, and two small items fell out. The first thing she saw was the back of a picture, with the date “04/19/2011” handwritten in Sharpie. She grabbed it and turned it over and saw herself and Chris grinning at the camera on his couch in his old dorm room, while she held up a solved puzzle box. Beneath that was a piece of paper with a handwritten note:

“Ellie,

Thank you for solving my final creation.

1qc9zo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/eggfreezing/comments/1qc9zo2/complete_cycle_recap_36yo_amh_29/,"Complete Cycle Recap - 36yo, AMH 2.9","Hi there! I recently completed my first egg freezing cycle and wanted to share a full recap. I read several recap posts on here that were incredibly helpful as I prepared for my cycle - hopefully this is helpful to others out there! Full cost breakdown is at the bottom. 



**The Stats**

36yo, AMH 2.9, AFC 16 at initial ultrasound. I live in Houston, Texas. I'm lucky to live in a big city with excellent medical care, multiple clinic/doctor options, and no long waits to see a doctor. I don't have PCOS or endo or any other concerns related to fertility, at least none that I know of. I have never been pregnant or tried to get pregnant, so I started this journey really just trying to gain information about my own fertility since I didn't have anything to go off of. 

I’m single and live alone (with my dog!). My mom helped me financially and helped me on the day of the retrieval; otherwise I was on my own. I don’t have insurance coverage for fertility treatment, but did have some coverage for medication, bloodwork, and specialists visits.



**The Timeline**

Mid-September 2025 - initial telehealth consultation with doctor to learn about egg freezing process. 

Mid-October 2025 - bloodwork, ultrasound, urine sample. 16 follicles observed on ultrasound. Put on birth control to keep things stable. 

Early November 2025 - in-person consult with doctor to go over bloodwork results, which were mostly normal (low vitamin D, slightly high cholesterol which is normal for me), and discuss next steps. She said as soon as I paid, I could pretty much start right away, but I usually take a little while to process and consider things, especially things that cost over $10,000 :) 

Late November - committed and paid for the treatment cycle

12/2 - blood test and ultrasound, stopped birth control at doctor’s direction

12/7 - started treatment! 

  
**The Stims**

I did all my shots/meds between 8:45-9:15 pm. My monitoring appointments were in the mornings anywhere from 8:30-11 am, and I would get updated medicine instructions from the clinic around 3-4 pm after the doctor reviewed the results. Everything was communicated through messages in their online portal, which was helpful for remembering all the medication doses and details.

The shots really weren’t that bad! I have a nurse friend who agreed to facetime with me on the first night of stims to help me through it and make sure I did everything right. That was really helpful, and after that I felt confident doing it all myself. I would ice the injection site for a couple minutes before and after doing the shot. Honestly the worst part was mixing the menopur - so time consuming and irritating, like why can’t it just come in a pre-filled syringe like the other ones?? That one slightly stings as you inject, but doing it slowly helped, and I got used to it after a couple days. Cute lil band-aids helped too :) 

During stims, I tried to get 10,000 steps each day, eat 100 g protein, drink 80-100 ounces of water, and eat 1800-2000 calories. I stuck to it most days but not every day. I also didn’t drink any alcohol and limited myself to one cup of coffee each day. I felt totally normal for the first week or so. On day 8 or 9, I started to feel a little bloated and uncomfortable, and that came and went during the second half of the cycle. There was only one day where I was severely uncomfortable. I was more tired than usual and found myself wanting to rest when I got home from work, but only napped a couple of days. I was paranoid about falling asleep and missing my window for shots, but luckily that never happened!



**The Protocol**

Day 1 - follistim 150, menopur 150

Day 2 - follistim 150, menopur 150

Day 3 - follistim 150, menopur 150

Day 4 - monitoring appointment; follistim increased to 225, menopur 150

Day 5 - follistim 225, menopur 150

Day 6 - monitoring appt (11 follicles measuring between 4-7mm); follistim 225, menopur increased to 225, added dexamethasone 0.5 mg (oral tablet)

Day 7 - follistim 225, menopur 225, dexamethasone

Day 8 - follistim 225, menopur 225, dexamethasone

Day 9 - monitoring appt (18 follicles, most measuring under 10mm but 6 were measuring between 11-15mm); added ganirelix 0.25, follistim 225, menopur 225, dexamethasone

Day 10 - ganirelix 0.25, follistim 225, menopur 225, dexamethasone

Day 11 - monitoring appt (19 follicles, 9 measuring 12+); ganirelix 0.25, follistim 225, menopur 225, dexamethasone

Day 12 - ganirelix 0.25, follistim 225, menopur 225, dexamethasone

Day 13 - monitoring appt (27 follicles, 13 measuring 14+) ganirelix 0.25, follistim 225, menopur 225

Day 14 - ovidrel trigger (250 mcg) given at 8:00 pm, started Zpack

Day 15 - Zpack

Day 16 - retrieval day! 

  
**The Retrieval**

They retrieved 13 eggs, and only 5 were mature. Recovery was relatively smooth, I felt some pain when I woke up from anesthesia and managed the pain throughout that first day with a heating pad and alternating tylenol/advil. They prescribed tylenol 3 and zofran for nausea, but I didn’t end up needing either. Continued taking Zpack until pills ran out. Days 2-5 of recovery, I wasn’t in pain but was on and off pretty uncomfortable due to bloating and constipation. I took stool softeners and laxatives but it took about a week for my bowel movements to return to normal. I monitored my weight each day to watch for signs of OHSS - I gained about 2 pounds on day 2 and 2 more on day 3, then went down at about the same rate so I was back to normal by day 5 or 6. 

If you work from home or in an office where you can be sitting most of the day, I feel like it would be doable to return to work 2 or 3 days after the retrieval, but I’d highly recommend taking at least the day of and the next day off to rest and recover. I teach elementary music which is quite active, so I definitely wouldn’t have been able to return to work for several days. I timed it so my retrieval would happen over winter break, but if I do another cycle this spring I will likely use several personal days so I am fully recovered. I do think I probably should have rested more - the day after my retrieval, I had 12 people over for a holiday cookie decorating party, which in hindsight was not a great idea :) 

I found that my sleep was kind of weird for about a week after the retrieval. I would get tired very early in the evenings but then would wake up in the middle of the night absolutely starving and wide awake, so I’d eat a protein bar and drink some electrolyte water and then try to go back to sleep. 

I was advised to eat lots of protein and sodium in the days after the retrieval as well as to drink tons of electrolytes. I heated up and drank chicken broth to make sure I got enough sodium and ate protein bars + protein shakes, and I also drank lots of water and used liquid IV and similar powder packets to add electrolytes. Next time I will try to eat less Christmas cookies and more vegetables :) 

  
**The Follow-Up**

Today, about 3 weeks later, I finally had a follow-up call with my doctor, which probably should have been sooner but she was traveling over the holidays. She explained that they went ahead and froze all 13 eggs even though only 5 were mature. I guess that is clinic policy, in the event that maturation technology advances between now and when I want to use the eggs. But she said I should just count on having 5. 

She said based on follicle counts and sizes at my monitoring appointments, she would have expected to retrieve 16-17 eggs with 12-13 being mature. She was surprised that only 5 eggs were mature and said it’s possible my follicles need to be bigger than 15mm to produce mature eggs, maybe more like 17-18. Dr. said to get better results in future cycles, we could try going an extra day or two to allow more follicles to grow bigger than 15, and she also said we could try a different trigger shot like lupron, a dual trigger, or schedule the trigger for 36 hours ahead of surgery instead of 35.5, which is what they did in the first cycle. Seems crazy that half an hour could make a difference, but what do I know! 

  
**The Wrap-Up**

Overall, it was a really positive experience. I didn’t feel much pain, didn’t have major side effects or problems, and was able to live daily life as normal throughout the process. If the process was free, I could easily be convinced to do several more cycles. I really like my doctor - she is clearly brilliant, warm but also very matter-of-fact. She is honest about statistics, age-related concerns, and likelihood of success and doesn't sugar-coat things. I definitely feel like I am capable hands. 

I take a low dose of sertraline for anxiety/OCD, and I was worried that the hormone shifts would be challenging. Surprisingly I didn’t feel a second of anxiety throughout the whole process! I felt calm and grounded and even a little excited. I was slightly emotional a few times, like tearing up while petting the most beautiful and soulful golden retriever in the park (lol), but otherwise I felt totally normal and good throughout. I didn’t experience a big hormone crash after the retrieval. Other than the low amount of mature eggs, it felt like a really successful cycle. 

I am lucky that my mom was able to help pay for this and is willing to help a second time (""but not any more after that!"" she has clearly stated multiple times, ha). My particular clinic has a bundling option where you can do 3 cycles for the cost of 2, not including medication costs. So I would pay another $10,750 for two cycles instead of 1, and I’m estimating I’d spend around $3500 on medication and other fees over two cycles. So I am strongly considering this option. I asked my dr about preparing differently - should I wait several months to optimize my health as much as possible, lose a little weight, take more supplements, etc? My dr said it would be helpful to focus on healthy eating and daily exercise for 2-3 months coupled with a prenatal and COQ10, but that age trumps those things, so she wouldn’t recommend waiting more than 3 months to do another cycle. I’ll have to schedule around school concerts and other events, so I will probably take a little time to look over my calendar and process all of the information I got from my follow-up, and then will likely plan to do a second cycle sometime in March-April. 

  
**The Cost**

Copays for appointments (not including monitoring appts during cycle): $280

Initial bloodwork: $446.81

Genetic screening: $545.03 (They told me I didn't need to do this now because I was freezing eggs not embryos, but I wanted to do it to have the information. I thought it would be more like $300, so maybe I should have waited, but oh well...) 

Self-pay cycle fee: $10,750

Medication costs: $1490.40

Anesthesia fee for retrieval: $350

Parking for appointments: $65.92 (why does this cost irritate me more than all of the others...) 

**Total cost: $13,928.16**

It was definitely wildly expensive, but I was expecting it to be more like $17,000, so I am happy with this total cost. My clinic said that self-pay patients should plan on spending $4000-$7000 in medication costs, so I feel very lucky to not have had to spend that much. My insurance covered a lot of the medicine as “specialty” drugs with copays that were between $250-$400 per drug. My job just switched our insurance so I’m crossing my fingers that my new plan will have similar coverage!



**The End**

If you made it this far, thanks for reading! This was such an intimidating process before I started, and I relied heavily on this sub to learn about egg freezing. What a gift to have a safe space on the internet to ask questions, share info, and provide support to each other! 

If you have questions, feel free to leave a comment or DM me. Good luck to you all on your own journeys! ",6,1768354450.0,eggfreezing,0,0.88,False
1qc9z4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1qc9z4j/my_final_creation/,My Final Creation,"Ellie walked home after a long day. She was drained from work, and wanted nothing more than to get home, turn on her TV, and kick up her feet. She’d been feeling emotionally spent for the last few weeks. When she got to her building, she noticed a package on the floor by the mailboxes. She quickly glanced at the label as she passed by, and was surprised to see that it was addressed to her. She looked closer at the label, and then froze. The sender was listed as Chris. Chris had died three weeks ago from a long fight with cancer. She had just gone to his funeral the week before. She stared at the package unmoving for what felt like hours, until finally, she reached for it. It was about the size of a toaster, and she was surprised by the weight of it. *There must be something dense in here,* she thought. She took a deep breath and began walking up to her apartment.

\--------------------------------

“Do you understand the material?” a man’s voice whispered. Ellie looked to her left.

“I think so,” she replied. “At least the part about vectors. Matrix multiplication, I’m not so sure of.”

“Actually, I understand that decently well, I think. My name’s Chris, by the way.”

“Ellie.” Ellie reached out her hand in response to Chris holding his out. “What building are you in? Maybe we should study later.”

“I’m in Mercury hall,” Chris replied.

“Me too!”

“I’ll be working on this stuff around 4 if you want to join. Maybe we can teach each other what we’re not so solid on.”

“That sounds great. I’ve been really struggling in this class.” Ellie gathered her things and left the lecture hall. A few hours later, back in her dorm building, she knocked on room 4C. The door opened.

“Chris?” she asked.

“Hey Ellie, come in.” Chris opened the door wide. The room had a futon, a table, and a lot of random stuff on every surface. Chris moved some things off the table so they could put their textbooks and pages of homework on it, and they began to work. After about an hour, they had finished the homework. She felt like both of them understood the material much better than before.

“You’re in my chemistry class too, right?” asked Chris.

“Oh yeah, with professor Johnson, right?” Ellie replied. Chris nodded.

“Are you ready for the quiz tomorrow?” he asked.

“Tomorrow? Wait, what’s today’s date?” she said as she scrambled for her watch.

“April 19^(th), 2011,” he said with a grin.

“Shoot! I forgot about it. I have to study.” She gathered her homework and her textbook, but suddenly she noticed something. “What’s that?” she asked.

“It’s a puzzle box,” he replied, picking it up off the table. “I love these things. I haven’t done this one yet, but it looks challenging.”

“Oh, I’ve done a few of those.” She squinted at it for a moment, then confidently said “This one doesn’t look too bad.” Chris grinned.

“Give it a shot,” he challenged. Ellie smirked and grabbed it from his hand. She carefully examined every surface, and began trying different ways of getting it open.

“Need some help?” ribbed Chris.

“Hang on, hang on. I’ve only had it ten seconds,” Ellie replied. She continued working on it with the occasional suggestion from Chris. Finally, after about fifteen minutes, it popped open in her hand. “We did it!” she exclaimed. Chris laughed.

“Hang on, I have something to commemorate this occasion.” He stood up and began rummaging around one of his shelves. He came back with an old instant camera.

“Does that thing work?” asked Ellie.

“Of course! It’s a real antique but I take care of it.” He sat back next to her and held the camera out facing both of them. “Smile!” he said just before the camera flashed. The camera began to print a picture out of the two of them sitting on the futon grinning, with Ellie holding up the opened puzzle box.

“I’ll be putting this in here,” said Chris as he grabbed the puzzle box from Ellie. He put the picture inside of it and reset the puzzle. “I get new ones all the time. Swing by if you want to study math and do a puzzle!”

Ellie grinned. “I will,” she said, and left to go back to her dorm to study for her chemistry quiz.

\--------------------------------

Ellie walked into her apartment and set the box down on her counter. She took off her jacket and her shoes, set her keys in the bowl, and grabbed the box, taking it with her to sit down on her couch. She grabbed a pen and used it to cut the box open. As she pulled back the flaps, a wooden box revealed itself to her. It had intricate designs on it, with panels, indentations, and protrusions on every surface she could see. She grinned and let out a quick chuckle, and took a moment to compose herself. She took it from the packaging and set it on her coffee table. *Alright, Chris*, she thought. *Let’s see what you’ve got.* Chris had clearly made this box – he was an amateur woodworker, only ever plying the craft to make puzzle boxes he gave to his friends or sold online on the side. The surfaces were a little rough, and not everything fit together perfectly. But if she knew Chris’s puzzles, this one would be tricky. Ellie spent time pushing on various panels and trying to move different sections. One panel would slide one way and back, but not seem to achieve anything. Then she pressed into a section and a drawer popped out just beneath it. *Ah-ha!* she thought as she pulled out the drawer. She looked in the cavity where the drawer was but saw nothing but smooth surfaces. Inside the drawer there appeared to be a small magnet. She pulled it out of the drawer. *This I can work with,* she thought as she continued trying various possibilities.

Ellie passed much of the rest of the evening trying to make progress on the box, but she didn’t have much to show for it. Just a few more panels and switches that led to nowhere. She resolved to get a good night’s sleep and pick up after work the next day.

Ellie worked as a manager at a local coffee shop. The work could be hectic and tiring, but she knew before she went in that day that it would be slow. The weather was nasty, and would be nasty all day. As she bundled up in her rain jacket and boots and walked out of her apartment, she took one more look at the puzzle box sitting on her coffee table.

Apart from the occasional spurt of activity, Ellie had been right about the coffee shop that day. She carried around a napkin on which she sketched various possibilities she hadn’t considered with the box. Between orders and tallying bean inventory she would visualize the box, the possibilities she’d tried, and what she’d learned. As her shift drew to a close, an idea suddenly came to her. *I haven’t tried –* She waved and said good night to Jimmy, the closer for the day, and hurried home, pulling her jacket closer as the wind whipped raindrops around her face.

Ellie pulled closed her apartment door and kicked off her boots, haphazardly hanging her rain jacket up and loosely tossing her keys in the bowl. She approached the box, staring at it as she did so. *If I remember right . . .* she thought as she grabbed the drawer she’d taken out the night before. She placed the magnet on top of the box where she knew another magnet was, and then pushed a panel that wouldn’t move unless the magnet was right there. Then she flipped the drawer upside-down and re-inserted it into the cavity it had come from. She felt a satisfying *click* as another drawer sprung open. “Yes!” she nearly shouted as she pulled this second drawer out. She looked at the bottom and saw a small golden key with a red ribbon tied around it. *A key, eh? Now I just have to find the key hole.*

Ellie put on her fluffy socks, made herself a bowl of mac and cheese, and put on her show, spending the evening casually playing with the box, trying possibilities, and learning more. She found a sequence that would let her rotate a circular panel that had a slot in it, and much to her surprise, the slot revealed half of a keyhole. *There!* she thought. *Now how do I reveal the rest of it?*

\--------------------------------

“How many does this make?” asked Chris.

“I think . . . eight?” replied Ellie as she set down the latest puzzle box the two of them had solved. “To be honest, the last couple have been a bit on the easy side.”

“Yeah,” replied Chris, “they used a lot of tropes we’ve already seen.” He paused for a moment. “You know, I used to do a little woodworking with my dad. I’ve got a couple ideas that would stump you.”

“You’ll make a puzzle box?” Ellie replied incredulously.

“Sure!” Chris replied. “Maybe it’ll be big and clunky, but a six pack of beer says it’ll be at least a little challenging.”

Ellie grinned. “You’re on.”

Two weeks later, Chris and Ellie finished another study session. Their semester was coming to a close, and both of them felt their math finals would be their biggest challenge. But they felt a lot more confident since they’d started studying together, each of them gravitating towards different parts of the subject, and filling in the other where they were weakest.

Chris sighed as he set his book down. “My brain’s fried,” he said.

“Mine too,” replied Ellie.

“Good.” He stood up and reached under his bed. He pulled out a splintery wooden box that was nailed together and the size of a microwave, setting it on his table in front of Ellie.

“What . . . is this?” Ellie said, a grin spreading across her face. “I can fit my finger through here!”

“Well don’t! I haven’t done this in years. Anyway, your clock starts now.”

Ellie broke into a laughing fit before taking a serious look at the box. She tried to rotate it but it made a strange grinding sound on the table, which caused her to succumb to another laughing fit. Chris smiled and went to the fridge for a beer.

“Where’s mine?” Ellie asked.

“You gotta earn it,” replied Chris.

“Well, I’m pretty sure I just did.” Ellie stuck her pen in a gap between two slats and disengaged a locking mechanism, causing one of the sides to fall off of the box.

“Hey, that’s cheating!” protested Chris.

“The box was locked. Now it’s open. Where’s my beer?”

\--------------------------------

Ellie had the day off. Good day for it too, since the weather report was sunshine and warm breezes. She had been unsuccessful the evening before in making much progress on the keyhole, and decided she’d go for a walk to clear her mind and try to get some ideas flowing. She grabbed a small notebook that fit in her purse and a pen, and walked out the door.

She headed for the local park, a place where she would frequently go for runs or picnics. After meandering for some time, loosely thinking about the box, she wandered close to a cart that was selling coffee. She approached it and bought a cup. She took a deep breath, getting the aroma of her coffee, the fresh air, and gentle scent of plant life on the breeze. The sky was a vivid, rich blue, with just a few streaks of clouds accentuating it. She strolled with her coffee to a small table on the side of the path and sat down. She pulled out her notebook and her pen and began doodling ideas on how to reveal the rest of the keyhole.

After she had finished about a third of her coffee and scratched several diagrams on her notebook, a woman came down the path with a child in tow. The woman’s child, a daughter, held a flower in her hand and was happily skipping along, looking at the various flowers on the side of the path. When they neared Ellie, the girl stooped over and picked a vibrant purple flower. “Look!” she said as she held it up for her mother. She closed her eyes and began spinning, holding her two flowers in each hand.

“Watch out!” said the mother as the girl’s spinning hand struck Ellie’s coffee. The coffee spilled over Ellie’s notebook, covering her diagrams of the box. “Oh, I’m so sorry!” said the mother as she pulled her daughter away from Ellie. Ellie scrambled to shake coffee off of her notebook, but the diagrams were ruined. The girl stood still, looking at Ellie with her hands by her mouth.

“I’m sorry,” she said.

“It’s alright. I know you didn’t mean to,” replied Ellie.

“You have to be more careful!” scolded the mother as she pulled her daughter along.

Ellie looked down at her notebook and the ruined diagrams. She was stumped. She leaned back and looked at the sky.

\--------------------------------

“I feel ridiculous,” said Chris as he took off his cap. His blue gown flapped gently in the wind.

“I feel like I can’t believe we survived,” replied Ellie as she took hers off as well. Family members, friends, and classmates bustled around them as they left the auditorium and went to their cars. Ellie and Chris stood near a parking lot where Chris had parked.

“I know. That math class was no joke,” said Chris. “Oh hey, before you go, I have something for you.” Chris jogged to his car and popped the trunk. He grabbed something and jogged back. “No pen will fit in this one,” he said, grinning as he handed Ellie a smaller, more refined puzzle box. Ellie smiled and gave it a quick once over.

“Nope, I think you’ve worked out that little bug.”

The two of them stood in silence for a moment.

“Well, my parents are taking me to a restaurant to celebrate. I think a lot of drinks will be involved,” said Chris.

“Funny, mine told me to go home and start studying for my grad program,” Ellie responded. Chris laughed.

“I know we’re heading down different paths now. But if you send me your address, I’ll send you a puzzle box every now and then. Every one’s a little bit trickier than the last!” said Chris.

“Deal,” replied Ellie.

\--------------------------------

Ellie placed her coffee-soaked notebook and her pen back in her purse, and stood up. *He might’ve gotten me this time,* she thought. She began walking slowly home. Her mind began to wander, the feeling of walking and of the sun on her skin inducing a state of pleasant ease. She walked by people, plants, dogs, buildings. Then she felt a nagging idea arise. She froze. *What if I –* And with that she began a brisk walk back to her apartment. When she got to her building, she took the stairs two at a time. She practically kicked off her shoes and staggered to her couch. Her breath came at a rapid pace as she pulled one drawer out and stuck her magnet at a specific point. She began rotating the circular panel, when there was a sudden *pop* and it flew off, clattering to the floor. She sat up and looked at the now fully exposed keyhole. She froze and stayed still for a moment. Then she grabbed the key with the red ribbon and slowly inserted it into the hole. She rotated it and heard the *click* of the final lock opening. The whole front of the box opened. She held the box up and tilted it, and two small items fell out. The first thing she saw was the back of a picture, with the date “04/19/2011” handwritten in Sharpie. She grabbed it and turned it over and saw herself and Chris grinning at the camera on his couch in his old dorm room, while she held up a solved puzzle box. Beneath that was a piece of paper with a handwritten note:

“Ellie,

Thank you for solving my final creation.

How hard I tried for this, applied for more than 1k+ jobs and got rejected, ghosted.

I’ll start from the start. I did my BCA in 2024, and in my final year, I started an internship at a fintech company. It was very good and remote, but after 10 months they expanded the team and started their office in Mumbai. I wasn’t able to relocate because of some personal problems, so I had to leave.

I had CMAT as a backup, so I got admission to a government college in the last vacant seat round, almost at the end of the first semester (literally one day before the exams). So I started my MCA along with exams, assignments, viva, and all. My first-semester CGPA was low (6.1), and then I got only one semester to push it to 7. By the start of the 3rd semester, placements had started. Seriously, a master’s was so different from a bachelor’s (go for a prestigious university if you’re going for a master’s; else don’t go for a master’s).


Placements started, and I also prepared, but I was rejected by most companies because of my CGPA. Mine was 6.3 for two semesters; companies wanted 7, 7.5, or 8. Some companies didn’t have any CGPA criteria, and some allowed 6.

I was rejected by almost every company. I applied to more than 1k jobs off campus. I literally had a bookmark list of almost 30 different platforms. I had accounts on all of those platforms and applied on every fu_king platform - always ghosted, no callbacks, nothing. 
Then I started applying for lower packages; still the same condition. Then I even applied for unpaid internships, and I still got rejected. I was so stressed; I was having hair fall for the last two months 😭.

At this stage, my parents were expecting that I was doing a master’s and would get a very good package. I was a ranker in my bachelor’s (out of 200+), but I wasn’t even in the top 20 in my master’s (35 total). All my friends got placed. I was never able to sit in companies offering a good package.

The first time I got interviewed by a company, I had three interviews. One was technical (the role was web dev, but I was asked everything, literally everything), and my interview went very well. Even the second round (DSA round, yes, separately) and HR all went well. But then they only hired candidates who were originally from the city where the company was located.

The second time, I cleared the rounds and then went to another city for the final interview. Just before the interview, I asked some old employees on LinkedIn who were from my college. They told me about the company, and the reviews were so bad that I rejected the company.

Then I was just receiving emails like: unfortunately…not moving with application...not lack of your strength....

Then one day, I received a congratulations email. I was so happy and finished the initial interview. Then I was given an assessment, which I completed, and then the final interview. I received the email that I was selected and that they would onboard me with final confirmation. I waited for the next week. Finally, the reply came: sorry, we have temporarily paused the hiring for this role. And I was like.... wasted half of a month.

Soon, one company came through college, and I was invited. The first round was an aptitude, reasoning, and coding test, and I finished before everyone. The second round was communication, and again I finished and got selected for the next round before everyone. I was fully confident that I would surely get this one. Then we had a 3-hour coding test, and obviously I finished properly and submitted it. We were told that they would invite us after the results for the final interview. I had already spent 12 days in the process. When the final list came, I was selected for the final interview.
In the final interview, there were four people, and the CEO was also in the meeting. The interview went very well, and I was very good with communication. Then came the moment where I made a mistake. They asked if I had any questions. I had done my research very well and knew about their projects and work, so I asked some questions and suggested some things. From my perspective, I suggested some very good implementations and also questioned their working techniques. Then the CEO interrupted, he was an old CEO and was on a trip or somewhere. He got hurt and very smoothly answered and also said that they only hire people with good behavior and attitude. Then the interview ended. I was 100% confident that I would be selected. I waited and waited, then received a message from my TPO. My name was there in the first message, and they said this candidate is on hold, and then there were three names for the selected students. I was so furious, disappointed, and idk how sad I was. I had full confidence that I would get selected, but…

So now I was at a stage where all my friends were placed, even people with fewer skills. I was under full stress, not eating properly (I live with my brother far from our family). I was thinking of starting from zero and learning everything again, what should I do? Sending DMs to people asking for referrals, begging for internships, and what not.

Last week, one more company came for college placement. I didn’t receive a call for an interview. I approached the hiring person and told him, so he scheduled my interview. On Sunday, I had my technical interview with two senior engineers, and it went very well. They were impressed with my skills and experience. I’ll start my internship from Monday.
I’m not as happy as I expected. There was no excitement because I know how much I went through for this one thing.

I’ve learned so many things and many lessons. Job hunting is the worst thing.

Please, guys, make connections and networking (not LinkedIn). Meet people, share your knowledge, book a meeting with them, and tell your ideas or vision. Buy them a coffee and just go for a meet. Networking and connections will be very helpful.

I still have a long way to go, as this is not my final goal. 
My days are very productive these days.

Build skills, work on projects (there are millions of problems, guys just choose the right one and build something; that’s the best).

Thank you, everyone, for reading this. All the best with your job hunt.",3,1768354308.0,developersIndia,3,0.72,False
