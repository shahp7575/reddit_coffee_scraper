1lsoxw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1lsoxw2/just_quit_as_kitchen_manager/,Just quit as kitchen manager!,"I just quit my job of 1.5 yrs! I was the kitchen manager of a coffee shop/brunch spot. In the time that I was in this role, I was given no ability to do what was in my job description. Couldn’t order food, couldn’t create an inventory tracker since the owner claimed they were working on one (still doesn’t have one after MONTHS), they asked for a new menu and after testing and creating one on my own dime they never implemented it, and so many more issues.

After securing another job, I put in my notice, and instead they ended my employment a week early. So instead, I ended it today!! Leaving tomorrow’s Sunday brunch to…have some difficulties. I at least warned my staff before sending a message in the work chat that blew UP!

Here’s what I said:

“Hey guys. I put my notice in earlier this week, and my last day was supposed to be next Thursday. Instead, I have been excluded from next week’s schedule. This means of the staff at <work>  are being punished with 6-day weeks and shorter shifts (no break meals!)

I apologize that it is being taken out on you all.

I quit, not because of one simple reason, but because of many big problems within this company.

The lack of communication from our bosses about events, promotions, finding out about promotions through social media before even being told.

Receiving our schedules not even 3 days ahead of time often times, leaving us to scramble any plans we need to make outside of work.

The empty promises. Promises of change, stability, and yet, here we are. Overwhelmed, understaffed, and unprepared.

The inability to do the jobs we were hired to do. As kitchen manager, I was supposed to do food orders, create an inventory tracker, new processes to streamline the kitchen. Yet, our bosses couldn’t hand responsibility over, wasting potential.

Employees are scared to complain, as they will be berated, pulled into a meeting with the person they’re complaining about (which in any HR meeting, is unprofessional).

Multiple health code violations that we are told are fine. Serving 2 week old spinach, storing raw meat with prepared meat, dropping cups on the floor and still using them. Members of the family knowingly giving Muslim people pork.

Finally, employee appreciation. Multiple employees have expressed that they feel taken for granted. The morale at <work> is at an all-time low, with more employees thinking about leaving.

So with this, I will not be coming in tomorrow. 

My keys are in the safe.

Thank you all for the connections we’ve made and the friendships we’ve had!”",2,1751763737.0,antiwork,0,1.0,False
1lsox6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lsox6z/im_being_followed_by_a_truck_thats_full_of_people/,I'm being followed by a truck that's full of people. There's a surgery going on in the cargo hold. I can see it through the glass.,"

*“What am I even looking at, here…”* I whispered to myself.

The soft clicking of my sedan’s turn signal chirped in my ear, and my fingers tapped against the steering wheel with an impatient rhythm. I turned away and attempted to keep my eyes fixed forward. Despite my best efforts,  though, I found my gaze drifting from the reddish glow of the stoplight to the reddish glow emanating from the truck.

My eyes narrowed as I scanned the enormous glass cargo hold, struggling to imagine what the purpose of such of thing could even be. There was movement inside of it, too. Some internal light fixture illuminated the people walking about the truck bed.

Initially, I couldn’t tell what they were doing.

A red curtain draped against the inside of the glass obscured my view.

Multiple human-shaped shadows flickered behind the curtain, pacing up and down the length of the eighteen-wheeler like a group of anxiety-riddled stagehands preparing for act one of a play on opening night.

Obviously, the thought was absurd. It was 3:53 in the morning. Main Street was appropriately deserted. Just me and the truck; no other vehicles in sight.

Who the hell would they even be performing for?

Icy sweat beaded on my forehead. I cranked the A/C to its highest setting. Some combination of exhaustion from my night shift and the uncanny sight was making my heart palpitate.

Then, they pulled back the curtain.

It was a devastatingly familiar scene. My breath came out in ragged gasps. Hot nausea creeped up the back of throat.

The shining steel table. Honeycombed overhead lights like monstrous bug-eyes. Drills. Scalpels. Monitors with video feeds displaying the table from every conceivable angle. Away from the table, a flock of subordinates, attired in sterile gowns and powdered gloves, remained still.

They waited for their leader’s command.

He was impossibly tall, hunching slightly forward to prevent his head from grazing the top of the hollow container. As if to further delineate his rank, the leader’s smock was leathery and skin toned; everyone else’s was white and cleanly pressed. Between the mask covering his mouth and the glare from the light affixed to his glasses, I couldn’t see his face.

He lumbered toward the table, fingers wrapped around the handles of a wheelchair.

The person in the wheelchair was unconscious. A young man with a mop of frizzy brown hair, naked as the day he was born. His head was dead weight, rolling across his chest he creaked forward, inch by tortuous inch.

Despite his rag-doll body, I knew his awake. Even if I couldn’t see them, I knew there was life in his eyes.

He just couldn’t move his body.

Still, they were going to perform a surgery on the poor sap.

I looked away. The traffic light was still red. I glanced at the clock.

*4:01AM*.

Without a second thought, my boot crashed onto the accelerator. I sped down Main Street. The truck became smaller and smaller in my rear-view mirror until it was just a dot of light on the horizon.

A wave of relief swept down my spine, but an intrusive thought soured my respite.

*They’ve likely started operating, and he can feel everything. The ripping of skin. The oozing of blood. His nerves are screaming.*

*He just can’t say anything.*

\- - - - - 

*“…I’m sorry Pete, run that by me again? What was so wrong with the truck?”* James asked, rubbing his temple like he had a migraine coming on.

I tore off a sheet from a nearby paper towel roll and reached over our kitchen island.

*“You’re dripping again, bud,”* I remarked.

James cocked his head at me, then looked to the wipe. He couldn’t feel the mucus dripping from the corner of his right eye, apparently. It took a few seconds for him to process the statement.

Recognition flashed across his face.

*“Oh! Shoot.”*

He grabbed the paper towel and blotted away the gelatinous teardrop - a side effect from the LASIK procedure that he had underwent a month prior.

Overall, I agreed with him: James looked better without glasses. That said, if attention from the opposite sex was the name of the game, the persistent ocular discharge that he now suffered from seemed like a bit of monkey’s paw. One step forward, two steps back.

He didn’t seem overly preoccupied with the issue.

As he crumpled the paper towel, I tried explaining what’d happened the night before. For the third time.

*“I’m driving home from a shift, idling at a stoplight, and this truck pulls up beside me. One of those big motherfuckers. Cargo hold the size of our apartment, monster-truck wheels - you get the idea. But the cargo hold, it’s this huge glass box. There’s a curtain on the inside, like they were about to debut a mobile rendition of Hamlet. But they - the people inside of the box, I forgot to mention the people - they weren’t about to perform a play. I mean, I don’t know for sure that they weren’t, but that’s besides the point. They looked like they were going to…and I know how this sounds…but they looked like they were going to perform surgery…”*

My recollection of the event crumbled. I was losing the plot. Found myself distracted by James.

Now, both sides were leaking.

I ripped another piece of paper towel off the roll and handed it to him. He was watching me, but his expression was vacant. The lights were on behind his eyes, but nobody seemed to be home. I started to wonder if he’d discontinued his ADHD meds or something.

After an uncomfortable pause, he realized *why* I was giving him more tissue paper.

*“So, what was so wrong with the truck?”* he repeated, once again blotting the tears away.

\- - - - - 

About a week passed before I saw the truck again.

That time, it was all happening in broad daylight.

I rounded a corner onto Main Street and parked my car in front of our local coffee shop, pining for my afternoon bolus of caffeine to prepare for another grueling night shift.

As I placed my hand over the cafe’s doorknob, I heard a familiar jingling noise behind me. The rattling of change against the inside of a plastic cup. A pang of guilt curled around my heart like a hungry python.

I’d walked past Danny like he didn’t even exist.

I flipped around, digging through my pockets for a few loose bills.

*“Sorry about that, bud. Can’t seem to find the way out of my own head today.”*

Danny smiled, revealing a mouth only half-filled with teeth.

I’d known him for as long as I’d lived in town, give or take two years. Didn’t know much *about* him, though. I wasn’t aware why he was homeless, nor was I clued in as to why he never spoke. Say what you want about Danny, but it’s hard to deny that the man was a curiosity. He didn’t fit nicely into any particular archetype, I suppose. His beard was wild and his dentition was a nightmare, but the odd camo-colored jumpsuits he sported never smelled too bad. He was mute, but he didn’t appear to have any other severe mental health issues. No obvious ones, anyway. He always appeared content even though he lived on the street, begging for change.

A man of inherent contradictions, silently loitering on a bench in front of the cafe, day in and day out. I liked him. There was something hopeful lingering behind his existence. Gave him what I had to spare when I went for coffee most days.

As I dropped the crumpled five-dollar bill into his cup, I saw it passing behind him.

The truck was moving about fifteen miles an hour, but that did not seem to bother them. The leader didn’t struggle to keep his balance as he toiled away, both hands inside his patient. The table and the tools and the crash cart didn’t shift around from the momentum.

It was difficult to determine *exactly* what procedure they were performing. The monitors and their video feeds were pointed towards the operation, yes, but they were so zoomed in that it was nearly impossible to orient myself to what I was seeing: an incomprehensible mess of gleaming viscera, soggy, red, and pulsing.

Best guess? They were rooting around in someone’s abdomen.

Now, I’m a pretty reserved person. My ex-wife described me as *conflict-avoidant* to our marriage counselor. But the raw surprise of seeing that truck and the accompanying gore broke my normal pattern of behavior. Really lit a fire under my ass.

*“Hey! What the hell do you all think you’re doin’? There’s an elementary school a block over, for Christ’s sake!”* I shouted, jogging after the truck.

With its hazard lights flashing, the vehicle started to pull over to the side of the road. I had almost caught up to it when I heard the pounding of fast, heavy footsteps behind me.

Danny slowed his pace, wrapped his arm around my shoulders, and began *speaking*. His voice was low and raspy, like his vocal cords were fighting to make sound through a thick layer of rust. He didn’t really *say* anything, either. Or, more accurately, what he was saying had no meaning.

*“Well..yes..and…you see that…”* - on and on and on.

In retrospect, I realize that wasn’t the point. Danny wasn’t talking to relay a message. No, he was just *pretending* to be embroiled in conversation, and he wanted me to play along. With his arm wrapped around my shoulder, he forcefully pushed my cheek with his fingers, turning my head so my eyes would face him, and not the truck.

I didn’t intend to play along. I was still fuming about the gruesome display, aiming to give the perpetrators a piece of my mind. But the entire sequence of events was so disarmingly strange that my brain just ended up short-circuiting.

So, I played along.

The look of raw dread behind Danny’s eyes convinced me to help maintain the charade of a conversation, even if I didn’t understand why it was so important. I suppressed my anger and walked alongside him until we reached the nearest alleyway. He started turning into it, so I followed suit.

I caught a glimpse of the parked truck as we pivoted.

They were no longer operating. Instead, they were all clustered in a corner, staring intently at us, the leader’s skin-toned smock and gaunt body towering above the rest of the group.

As soon as we were out of view, Danny dropped the act. He doubled over, hyperventilating, hand pushed into the brick of the adjacent building to keep him from falling over completely.

*“What the fuck is going on?”* I whispered.

The man’s breathing began to regulate. My voice grew louder.

*“What the hell kind of surgery are they doing in there?”*

Danny shot up and put a finger to his lips to shush me. I acquiesced. Stayed silent and waited. Once it was clear that I wasn’t going to start yelling at him again, he pulled the five-dollar bill I’d just given him from one pocket and a cheap ballpoint pen from the other. The man rolled the bill against the brick wall and furiously scribbled a message. He then folded it neatly, placed it on his palm, and offered it to me.

Reluctantly, I took the money back.

He muttered the word “*sorry*” and then ran further into the alleyway. I didn’t give chase.

Instead, I uncrumpled the bill and read his message. Danny’s erratic handwriting conveyed a series of fragmented warnings:

*“It looks different for everyone.”*

*“If you react, they can tell you’re uninhabited.”*

*“Once they’re sure, that’s when they take you.”*

*“They chose brown for their larvae - brown is the most common.”*

*“You need to leave town tonight.”*


\- - - - - 

The next afternoon, I discovered Danny’s usual bench concerningly unoccupied.

But the truck was there. Parked right outside the cafe.

New patient, new surgery.

I trusted Danny was on to something, but I didn’t heed his advice and leave town.

Not right away.

It was nearly impossible to *pretend* they weren’t there, especially once they started driving around my neighborhood at night. I could faintly hear the whirring of drills above the grumbling engine, intermittently passing by my bedroom window.

They didn’t just plant themselves right outside my front door, thankfully. They still did their rounds, their “patrol”, but it felt like they’d taken a special interest in me. Maybe I was a unique case to them. They weren’t *completely* confident I could see them. I’m sure it was pretty cut and dry most of the time. Danny’s intervention had put me in a nebulous middle ground. Maybe I did see them that day. Or maybe I was just having a heated conversation with Danny. 

Thus, they increased the pressure.

Either I’d crack, or I wouldn’t.

I came pretty close.

You see, it wasn’t just the sheer absurdity of it all that was getting to me. The stimuli felt targeted. Catered to my very specific set of traumas. I suppose that probably yields the best results.

Which brings me to this:

Have you ever heard of a condition called *Anesthesia Awareness?*

It’s the fancy name for the concept of maintaining consciousness during a surgery, instead of falling asleep. All things considered, it’s a fairly common phenomenon: one for every fifteen thousand operations or so.

For most, it’s only a blip. A fleeting lucidity. A quick flash of awareness, and then they’re back under.

For most, it’s painless. Even without pain, it’s still pretty terrifying. Paralytics are a devilish breed of pharmacology. Complete and utter muscular shutdown without touching the brain’s ability to think and perceive. Immurement within the confines of your own flesh. To me, there isn’t a purer vision of hell.

That said, I’m fairly biased. Because I’m not like most.

I was awake for the entirety of my appendectomy, and I felt every single thing. Sure, they saved my life. I was on death’s door. My appendix detonated like a grenade inside my abdominal cavity.

But I mean, at what cost?

The first incision was the worst. I won’t bother describing the pain. The sensation was immeasurable. Completely off the scale.

And I couldn’t do a goddamn thing about it.

They dug around in my torso for nearly two hours. Exhuming the infected appendix and cleaning up the damage it’d already done. Cauterizing my bleeding intestines. 

I *sort of* accumulated to the pain. I never accumulated to the smell.

About half-way through, I even managed to kick my foot. Just once, and it wasn’t much. It’d taken nuclear levels of energy and willpower to manifest that tiny movement through the effects of the paralytic.

A nurse mentioned the kick to the surgeon. Want to know what he said in response?

*“Noted.”*

\- - - - - 

I’ve been hoping the truck would give up at some point and just move on. It wasn’t a great plan, but I didn’t exactly have the money to skip town and start a life somewhere else.

What transpired this afternoon changed my opinion on the matter.

When I stopped by the coffee shop, the truck was there, per my new normal. I’d considered completely altering my routine to avoid them, but if the safest thing to do was to pretend they weren’t there, wouldn’t that be suspicious?

As I was walking out with my drink, doing my absolute damndest to act casual, I saw who was on the operating table today.

It may not have *actually* been him, of course. It could have just been an escalation on their part. A sharper piece of stimuli in order to finally illicit a reaction from me.

To their credit, witnessing Danny being cut into did make me flinch. I’m not sure how obvious it was.

When I got back to my sedan, I didn’t head to work. I returned home to retrieve a couple of necessities; primarily, family photos and my revolver. Wanted to say goodbye to James as well.

He wasn’t expecting me home so soon.

*They* weren’t expecting me home so soon.

I threw open the front door to our apartment, and there he was: propped up on the couch, motionless, trails of mucus across his cheeks, all the way down to the collar of his shirt.

Eyeless.

No blood anywhere.

I heard them before I saw them.

They emit this deep, gurgling sound when threatened. It’s not loud, but it’s hard to miss.

Then, one came into view. Guess it’d been scaling the back of the couch when I walked in.

Honestly, it resembled an oversized caterpillar: pale, segmented, scrunching its body as it moved - but it was as big as a sausage link. Its tail was distinctive, tapering off like a wasp’s belly until the very end, at which point it abruptly expanded and became spherical with colored markings. 

From behind, it looked like an eyeball with a hazel-colored iris.

Danny called them *larvae*. I suppose that’s a good fit. I’m assuming they can’t communicate with their hive mind until they're fully grown, otherwise, why wouldn’t James have alerted them to my lack of inhabitation?

Initially, I thought it was crawling back *into* James, head first into his eye socket so its tail could snuggly lay where his eye should have been.

It completely passed him by, though. Slithered down from the couch and onto the floor.

The larva was crawling towards me, I think.

I didn’t stick around to find out.

\- - - - - 

Honestly, I’m starting to believe most people are already inhabited.

For those among you who aren’t, I don’t know what the inside of the truck will look like when it gets to you, but it’ll be something that’s designed to get your attention.

Your best bet is to not respond.

Be like me on the operating table.

No matter how terrible it is, no matter how painful it feels, no matter how loud your body screams for you to intervene:

He was impossibly tall, hunching slightly forward to prevent his head from grazing the top of the hollow container.

He grabbed the paper towel and blotted away the gelatinous teardrop - a side effect from the LASIK procedure that he had underwent a month prior.

Overall, I agreed with him: James looked better without glasses. That said, if attention from the opposite sex was the name of the game, the persistent ocular discharge that he now suffered from seemed like a bit of monkey’s paw. One step forward, two steps back.

About a week passed before I saw the truck again.

That time, it was all happening in broad daylight.

I rounded a corner onto Main Street and parked my car in front of our local coffee shop, pining for my afternoon bolus of caffeine to prepare for another grueling night shift.

As I placed my hand over the cafe’s doorknob, I heard a familiar jingling noise behind me. The rattling of change against the inside of a plastic cup. A pang of guilt curled around my heart like a hungry python.

I’d walked past Danny like he didn’t even exist.

I flipped around, digging through my pockets for a few loose bills.

*“Sorry about that, bud. Can’t seem to find the way out of my own head today.”*

The monitors and their video feeds were pointed towards the operation, yes, but they were so zoomed in that it was nearly impossible to orient myself to what I was seeing: an incomprehensible mess of gleaming viscera, soggy, red, and pulsing.

Best guess? They were rooting around in someone’s abdomen.

Now, I’m a pretty reserved person. My ex-wife described me as *conflict-avoidant* to our marriage counselor. But the raw surprise of seeing that truck and the accompanying gore broke my normal pattern of behavior. Really lit a fire under my ass.

*“Hey! What the hell do you all think you’re doin’? There’s an elementary school a block over, for Christ’s sake!”* I shouted, jogging after the truck.

With its hazard lights flashing, the vehicle started to pull over to the side of the road. I had almost caught up to it when I heard the pounding of fast, heavy footsteps behind me.

Danny slowed his pace, wrapped his arm around my shoulders, and began *speaking*. His voice was low and raspy, like his vocal cords were fighting to make sound through a thick layer of rust. He didn’t really *say* anything, either. Or, more accurately, what he was saying had no meaning.

*“What the fuck is going on?”* I whispered.

The man’s breathing began to regulate. My voice grew louder.

*“What the hell kind of surgery are they doing in there?”*

Danny shot up and put a finger to his lips to shush me. I acquiesced. Stayed silent and waited. Once it was clear that I wasn’t going to start yelling at him again, he pulled the five-dollar bill I’d just given him from one pocket and a cheap ballpoint pen from the other.

Not right away.

It was nearly impossible to *pretend* they weren’t there, especially once they started driving around my neighborhood at night. I could faintly hear the whirring of drills above the grumbling engine, intermittently passing by my bedroom window.

They didn’t just plant themselves right outside my front door, thankfully. They still did their rounds, their “patrol”, but it felt like they’d taken a special interest in me. Maybe I was a unique case to them. They weren’t *completely* confident I could see them. I’m sure it was pretty cut and dry most of the time. Danny’s intervention had put me in a nebulous middle ground. Maybe I did see them that day. Or maybe I was just having a heated conversation with Danny. 

Thus, they increased the pressure.

Either I’d crack, or I wouldn’t.

I came pretty close.

You see, it wasn’t just the sheer absurdity of it all that was getting to me. The stimuli felt targeted. Catered to my very specific set of traumas. I suppose that probably yields the best results.

Which brings me to this:

Have you ever heard of a condition called *Anesthesia Awareness?*

It’s the fancy name for the concept of maintaining consciousness during a surgery, instead of falling asleep. All things considered, it’s a fairly common phenomenon: one for every fifteen thousand operations or so.

For most, it’s only a blip. A fleeting lucidity. A quick flash of awareness, and then they’re back under.

For most, it’s painless. Even without pain, it’s still pretty terrifying. Paralytics are a devilish breed of pharmacology. Complete and utter muscular shutdown without touching the brain’s ability to think and perceive. Immurement within the confines of your own flesh. To me, there isn’t a purer vision of hell.

That said, I’m fairly biased. Because I’m not like most.

I was awake for the entirety of my appendectomy, and I felt every single thing. Sure, they saved my life. I was on death’s door. My appendix detonated like a grenade inside my abdominal cavity.

But I mean, at what cost?

The first incision was the worst. I won’t bother describing the pain. The sensation was immeasurable. Completely off the scale.

And I couldn’t do a goddamn thing about it.

They dug around in my torso for nearly two hours. Exhuming the infected appendix and cleaning up the damage it’d already done. Cauterizing my bleeding intestines. 

I *sort of* accumulated to the pain. I never accumulated to the smell.

About half-way through, I even managed to kick my foot. Just once, and it wasn’t much. It’d taken nuclear levels of energy and willpower to manifest that tiny movement through the effects of the paralytic.

A nurse mentioned the kick to the surgeon. Want to know what he said in response?

*“Noted.”*

I’ve been hoping the truck would give up at some point and just move on. It wasn’t a great plan, but I didn’t exactly have the money to skip town and start a life somewhere else.

What transpired this afternoon changed my opinion on the matter.

When I stopped by the coffee shop, the truck was there, per my new normal. I’d considered completely altering my routine to avoid them, but if the safest thing to do was to pretend they weren’t there, wouldn’t that be suspicious?

As I was walking out with my drink, doing my absolute damndest to act casual, I saw who was on the operating table today.

It may not have *actually* been him, of course. It could have just been an escalation on their part. A sharper piece of stimuli in order to finally illicit a reaction from me.

To their credit, witnessing Danny being cut into did make me flinch. I’m not sure how obvious it was.

When I got back to my sedan, I didn’t head to work. I returned home to retrieve a couple of necessities; primarily, family photos and my revolver. Wanted to say goodbye to James as well.

He wasn’t expecting me home so soon.

*They* weren’t expecting me home so soon.

I threw open the front door to our apartment, and there he was: propped up on the couch, motionless, trails of mucus across his cheeks, all the way down to the collar of his shirt.

Eyeless.

No blood anywhere.

I heard them before I saw them.

They emit this deep, gurgling sound when threatened. It’s not loud, but it’s hard to miss.

Then, one came into view. Guess it’d been scaling the back of the couch when I walked in.

Honestly, it resembled an oversized caterpillar: pale, segmented, scrunching its body as it moved - but it was as big as a sausage link. Its tail was distinctive, tapering off like a wasp’s belly until the very end, at which point it abruptly expanded and became spherical with colored markings. 

From behind, it looked like an eyeball with a hazel-colored iris.

Danny called them *larvae*. I suppose that’s a good fit. I’m assuming they can’t communicate with their hive mind until they're fully grown, otherwise, why wouldn’t James have alerted them to my lack of inhabitation?

Initially, I thought it was crawling back *into* James, head first into his eye socket so its tail could snuggly lay where his eye should have been.

It completely passed him by, though. Slithered down from the couch and onto the floor.

The larva was crawling towards me, I think.

I didn’t stick around to find out.

\- - - - - 

Honestly, I’m starting to believe most people are already inhabited.

For those among you who aren’t, I don’t know what the inside of the truck will look like when it gets to you, but it’ll be something that’s designed to get your attention.

Your best bet is to not respond.

Be like me on the operating table.

No matter how terrible it is, no matter how painful it feels, no matter how loud your body screams for you to intervene:

1lsovhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lsovhd/shhh_is_what_my_boyfriends_reflection_whispered/,"“Shhh,” Is What My Boyfriend’s Reflection Whispered to Me"," I live with my boyfriend, Evan, in a little one-bedroom house we rent just outside Salem, Massachusetts — old place, creaky pipes, uneven floorboards, draft in the kitchen window we keep forgetting to fix. It’s not much, but it’s ours. We split rent and chores and bad takeout. Most nights we fall asleep to the sound of the neighbor’s dog losing its mind at squirrels in the yard. Yeah — domestic bliss.

Evan and I met in college — it was during our sophomore year at UMass Amherst. I was sitting in the back row of a medieval history lecture I was only taking for gen-ed credit, doodling in the margins of my notebook. 

He was seated just in front of me and he turned to me and asked if the professor always looked like he just woke up from a haunted nap. I snorted. Long story short,  we’ve practically been joined at the hip since then. 

He’s originally from Barre, Vermont. Real small-town kid. He grew up surrounded by trees, not people. He talks about it like it was equal parts boring and sacred. He still says “soda” instead of “tonic,” which drives my Boston-raised brain crazy.

Evan’s a freelance copywriter — mostly ad stuff for outdoor gear companies. I teach piano lessons part-time and work the counter at a restaurant in Marblehead. We both graduated into a garbage job market and never really recovered, but we make do.

Evan and I have been together for three years. Moved in after one year together.  We still fight over stupid stuff — whose turn it is to take the compost bin out, who forgot to Venmo for utilities — but he makes me laugh when I least expect it, and there's something soft and decent in him I trust.

Which is why this next part is so hard to explain.

\---

It was a Thursday night like any other. We’d eaten takeout sushi, washed down with cheap sake from the liquor store down the street. We settled in to binge-watch one of Evan’s shows — some true crime doc that had him hooked. Eventually, we shuffled to the bathroom to brush our teeth and wind down.

The bathroom is tiny — barely enough space for the two of us. The paint under the sink is peeling, revealing a sad, cold blue that seems to suck warmth out of the room no matter how hot the water gets. We stood side by side, the chipped mug with a faded whale on it holding our toothbrushes resting on the cracked porcelain sink. 

It was one of those moments that feels so normal you forget it’s even happening while it’s happening.

Until something breaks.

Evan was on my left, humming softly, some tune I’d played for my student earlier that afternoon. I hadn’t even realized I’d played it out loud enough for him to pick up the melody. I smiled, and I winked at him through the mirror. 

Anyway we were just going through the motions under the dim bathroom light when I glanced at the mirror and noticed Evan’s reflection didn’t quite keep up with him. It lagged just a fraction — barely there, but enough to make my stomach tighten. I blinked, shook my head, and told myself I must be seeing things or the poor lighting in the bathroom.  Still, the feeling lingered. 

When  he leaned forward to spit into the sink, his reflection stayed upright. It must have stayed there for a second, maybe two. Then it caught up — like a bad video call buffering.

I froze and looked at him directly — and he was fine. He didn’t seem to notice that the mirror had lagged. Instead he rinsed, dried his hands, kissed me on the cheek and he went to bed. Within five minutes he was fast asleep, as always. 

I didn’t tell Evan. I couldn’t. I didn’t even know how to start that conversation.

“Hey, babe, your reflection isn’t syncing up with your body — maybe you’re haunted?”

Yeah, I don’t think so.”   

\---

 I don't know how long I lay awake staring at the ceiling still completely perplexed at what I'd just seen. I just didn't know what to make of it? I thought about the hallucinogens I’d messed around with back in college — psilocybin once or twice, acid just the one time. Nothing intense and of course weed, which I still partake every once in a while. 

But still… Maybe something was catching up with me. Maybe I’d cracked something open and forgotten to close it. Maybe something was coming back to bite me in the ass? Or maybe I was losing my mind? Both prospects aren't sitting right with me. I mean wow, pick your poison right? 

\---

That night I barely slept. I told *myself I imagined it. Maybe I was tired. Maybe the light hit it wrong.* But it kept happening.

During the following days I started watching him more closely. I’d catch him reaching for a coffee mug, and for a split second I’d look at the window behind him, just to make sure the reflection was doing the same thing. Most of the time, it was. Or at least close enough to pretend.

But sometimes… it wasn’t.

Sometimes it was off by half a beat. Just enough to notice. Just enough to make my stomach flip. Once, I swear, the reflection smiled before he did — like it knew what he was going to feel,  like it was playing along.

I kept telling myself I was being paranoid, sleep-deprived, anxious; anything to convince myself there was a reasonable explanation for the all the weird shit I've been seeing.  I even Googled ""mirror lag"" to see if maybe it was a lighting thing, or some optical glitch I didn't understand. I found a Reddit thread where someone said their mirror made people look “too alive.” I closed the tab and didn’t sleep that night again. 

Evan didn’t seem different. He still kissed me on the forehead when I was working. He still cracked dumb jokes during dinner. Still cuddled with me in bed like everything was normal.

Three nights later, I saw it again — just out of sync. They were subtle, and easy to miss — a smile too slow to catch up.  Once, I saw the reflection smile when Evan wasn’t smiling at all.

\---

Then there was the bathtub incident. 

We were fooling around in the tub together, it wasn’t particularly romantic, just a spur of the moment thing. The shower was sputtering a thin spray, sounding all clogged up like it was begging to be replaced.

Evan was standing in front of me;  I was kneeling in front of him, caught up in the moment when suddenly the mirror above the sink fogged with steam — caught my eye when I glanced up. 

At first, I just saw blurred shapes and soft colors, but then the fog seemed to thin, and the reflection sharpened.

I caught sight of Evan’s face. But something was… off.

It took awhile for me to realize his reflection wasn’t focused on me. The real Evan was looking down at me but his reflection was staring straight ahead — right at the mirror, right at me.

Then it did something I have neve been able to shake since. It smiled. 

 I froze up and  blinked hard once as I watched the reflection’s lips curled into a slow, unnatural smile.

Not the smile Evan had, but the smile the mirror *wanted* me to see. 

My whole body tensed at the reflection’s eyes — dark and unblinking, fixed on mine like a predator sizing up its prey. I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t. I sprang up, slipped out of the tub, naked and dripping, and bolted straight to the bedroom, locking the door behind me. 

Maybe ten seconds later, Evan turned the knob once and knocked.

 “Claire? What’s going on?” 

He sounded confused.  

I leaned against the door, water soaking into the hardwood floor, trying to breathe like It was the only thing keeping me from losing my fucking mind.

Evan just stood there on the other side of the door like he wasn’t sure if he should press the matter or let it go. My heartbeat was pounding so hard he might as well have heard it on the other side of the door. 

“I’m ok Evan, I just have the cramps,” was all I could think of to say.

\---

That was the moment I stopped pretending this was just stress or sleep deprivation or some leftover acid echo from college.

Something was *wrong*. And I was the only one seeing it.

A week after the bathtub… thing, I stopped making excuses. I didn’t want to believe it. But I couldn’t keep pretending everything was fine while his reflection looked like it wanted to crawl out of the glass and wear him like a coat.

So I waited until Friday night. Evan always takes longer in the bathroom after dinner — brushing his teeth, doing that slow, methodical hair routine I always made fun of him for,  like he's prepping  for a magazine shoot instead of bedtime — something. 

I knew I'd have a window.

I told him I needed to finish some invoices for my students and sat down at the kitchen table with my laptop open. I kept my phone in my hoodie pocket until I heard the water start running. Then I got up, walked down the hall, and left it propped face-up on the hallway bookshelf — just barely angled toward the bathroom mirror facing the door which was half open. 

It looked stupid — like something out of a found footage movie. But it was all I could think to do. 

I told myself I just wanted peace of mind. A little confirmation that I was overthinking this. 

 I don’t know why I bothered lying to myself, not when I already knew.

Later that night, after he’d gone to bed, I locked myself in the bathroom with the lights off, slid down to the floor with a blanket, and pressed play.

At first, it was normal. Just Evan brushing his teeth. Spitting. Rinsing, gargling,  running a hand through his hair.

But then, around the two-minute mark, something moved.

Evan turned his body slightly — like he was leaning down to grab something from under the sink — but his reflection didn’t move with him. 

Not at all.

It just stayed there, standing upright and Staring.

The reflection turned its head —  and looked *directly straight at the camera* like it knew where I had hidden it. 

It looked directly at *me*.

Then it vanished — just a glitch and the reflection synced up again. 

\---

The following night I made up some excuse about feeling sick and I  spent the night on the couch, curled up under a scratchy throw blanket that smelled like dust and lavender. Evan didn’t question it. He just kissed my forehead and said, “Hope you feel better,” before disappearing down the hall.

But I didn’t feel better. I felt like I was being hunted — from inside the glass.

I started avoiding mirrors entirely. 

 I got dressed using the oven door’s reflection and brushed my teeth with my back to the bathroom sink. I didn’t even check my face before work. I just couldn’t bring myself to look, afraid of what might look back.

Evan didn’t notice. Or maybe he did and  didn’t say anything. He was busy with a deadline, tapping away at his laptop from the couch. I kept watching him when he wasn’t looking — trying to find something wrong in the real version of him. But everything looked… fine. Normal.

That night, I tried to sleep in our bed again.

*Tried.*

I woke up sometime after 3 a.m. — to a creeping sense that something wasn’t quite right. You know that feeling when a room *feels* occupied, even if no one’s making a sound? 

I rolled over.

Evan was asleep— mouth slightly open, one arm raised above his head and the other folded over his stomach.  His chest rose and fell, slow and steady.

But in the mirror on the far wall — I saw movement.

I tried convincing myself it was just the angle, until my eyes adjusted to realize: the reflection wasn’t lying down.

It was *sitting up*.

Evan’s body was still next to me sound asleep. But in the mirror, he was sitting in bed. His head turned slightly toward me. 

I didn’t move,  I didn’t breathe, I didn’t want to catch its attention. But the reflection stared at me with a blank expression of *awful stillness*, like it was studying me. 

Measuring something, or deciding. 

And then — OH God — it lifted one hand and raised a finger to its lips.

It said  “Shhh.”

That sound — that one syllable — didn’t come from Evan’s body beside me. It came from the mirror. From the thing inside it. Soft, with an almost deceptive gentleness, like a lullaby made out of knives.

Then it moved.

I don’t know how, or when, but the reflection stepped out of the mirror. It made no sound—not even the breaking of glass or the crack of the mirror. It inched closer to the bed, slowly, biding its time like it had all the time in the world — like it had every right to be there. 

My skin went cold, then hot, then cold again. My vision narrowed, like I was about to pass out.  

I couldn’t look away as I watched this thing slowly approaching the bed. 

I don’t know how long I stayed like that — seconds, minutes, years? It might as well have been. 

It felt like the air around me had snapped tight, and nothing was getting through. 

 It walked to to my side of the bed where I lay frozen under the blankets, and then— It leaned in and bent over me

 Its face hovered inches from mine, it was Evan’s in every way  but the eyes, they were empty,  and devoid of any semblance of the Evan I loved. It stared as if trying to memorize me. 

I couldn’t move — I didn’t dare move. 

I wanted to scream, to cry out to shove it away — anything. 

But my body didn’t answer. 

I just shut my eyes — tight. 

I didn't just feel afraid, I felt small like prey, like a snail retreating into its fragile shell.  

My heart pounded so loudly, I wish it would wake Evan — the real Evan. If he was still real.

But eventually, I heard it step back.

One foot, then the other.

When I dared to crack my eyes open — just the smallest sliver — the mirror showed only our reflection again. 

Evan was still lying beside me, asleep.

Everything was exactly where it should be — except me. 

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night. I kept my eyes closed and prayed the sun would come soon.

\---

The next morning, I left the house.

I didn’t even tell Evan where I was going — I just mumbled something about needing to drop off something at work. I grabbed my bag, got into my car and waited until my fingers stopped shaking enough to turn the ignition. 

I pulled into a CVS parking lot and sat in my car for almost twenty minutes before I worked up the nerve to call her. Leah.

Evan’s older sister, the “cool one” — full sleeve tattooed arms, piercing laugh, calls bullshit on everyone, even their mom.

She’d always treated me like family. Once, when I was sick with the flu and Evan was out of town, she Grub-Hubbed me soup and texted, *Don’t let my idiot brother poison you with oregano tea again.*

She was the only person I could think of who might understand him better than I did.

She picked up on the second ring.

“Claire?” she said, surprised. “Hey! Everything okay?”

I didn’t even know where to start. I didn’t want to sound crazy.

But the second I opened my mouth, the words came pouring out in this weird, halting stream — not all the details, just enough: *Something’s wrong with Evan. Or with the house. Or with me. I don’t know. I just—*

I must’ve been babbling at that point, because her voice changed.

“Whoa, hey, slow down. You’re okay. You’re safe, right?”

“Yeah,” I lied. “I just… I needed to ask you something.”

“Of course.”

I swallowed, but my throat was so dry I could barely get it out. “Has Evan ever been… weird about mirrors? Like, growing up?”

Leah was silent for a long time, and for a second I thought I’d lost the call.

“Hello?” I said. “Are you there?”

“Yeah,” she answered finally. “Yeah, I’m here… what kind of weird?”

“Like —” I pinched the bridge of my nose. “Did he ever say they made him uncomfortable? Or that he didn’t like the way his reflection looked? Or—God, I don’t know. Did he ever say anything about… it not matching?”

There was more silence, which felt heavier now.

Then, quietly, she said: “You’re not imagining this.”

She told me when Evan was little — six, maybe seven — he had night terrors. Screamed about reflections watching him. He said his reflection wouldn't let him sleep at night, and that the the reflection *moved first.*

*Once*, Leah said, their mom found him standing completely still in front of the hallway mirror. He just stood there staring at it. When she asked what he was doing, he said, *“Making sure it doesn't come back.”*

“I remember that so clearly,” Leah said. “I asked him what he meant, and he told me, ‘The boy in the mirror is right where he belongs.""

I felt my skin crawl.

“I thought he was just being dramatic — we all did.”  she said. “Or dreaming with his eyes open. 

But after that… I don’t know.”

She paused again. Her voice shifted — like she was rummaging through old memories she hadn’t looked at in years.

“He was scared before,” she said quietly. “Like, really scared. He’d cry if the bathroom door stayed open at night, or if he caught his reflection by accident. But after that... I don’t know. He changed.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, careful not to push.

“He got loud,” she said. “Like... weirdly loud. He started cracking jokes constantly, like he couldn’t help it. Always wanted attention. But not in a bad way, I guess, just—different. He used to be so shy, always hiding behind me leg or ducking out of photos. And then suddenly, it was like someone flipped a switch.”

There was a pause. I heard her pacing.

“I remember our parents being relieved. Like, finally, he was acting like a ‘normal’ kid. But I always thought it felt a little... I don’t know. Off. Forced, maybe. Like he was performing what he thought ‘okay’ looked like.”

She hesitated, as if unsure how to say what she was going to say next. After a long pause, she sounded uncertain.

“I used to tell myself it was just him growing up. But now... sometimes I wonder if the Evan we know is really him at all. Like the real one got lost somewhere else — stuck in that reflection.”

My fingers clenched the phone a little tighter. My chest felt so tight I felt like the wind got knocked out of me.  

The idea that the Evan I loved might not be *real* — that the boy trapped in the mirror was the *true* Evan — made my skin crawl and my heart break all at once.

I swallowed hard and forced the words out.

 I could barely manage to raise my voice above a whisper, sounding  shaky and raw.

“But if that’s true... then what am I living with? What’s been here all this time?”

Then she said it:

“You need to leave. Tonight. Just get your stuff and go — you can stay with me for a while.” 

\---

That night, I packed a small bag — just the essentials, nothing too obvious —  change of clothes, my laptop, some cash, and my favorite worn sweater Evan got me for my birthday.

I found Evan  in the kitchen, reheating leftovers. He smiled when he saw me.

“Oh Hey,” he said. “You were out awhile. 

I hesitated, then I made up some excuse about how Brent — my  manager, asked me to fill in at the last minute for one of the new hires who couldn’t make it to work today. 

I felt guilty lying to him,  but I also didn’t want to explain why I was suddenly afraid of the bathroom mirror. Or why I stopped sleeping in the same bed with him. 

I walked to the hallways where I picked up my stuff. When I reached for the door, his voice called out from behind me. 

“Claire?” 

I hesitated a bit before I turned around.  

 Evan was halfway down the hall, barefoot, holding a glass of water. His eyes looked confused, like he wasn’t sure what to say or how to fix whatever was wrong.

“Are you going somewhere?”

There was no anger in his voice, no hint of suspicion. Just that same quiet softness that made me fall in love with him.

 I almost stayed.

I tried to speak, but I couldn’t quite find the right words. I wanted to tell him how much I loved him — that whoever, whatever he was, it didn’t matter.

Then I saw it, his reflection kept moving — like it was trying to break free from a threshold it was never meant to cross. 

That’s when I truly realized: the Evan I fell for — the one who made me laugh the first time we met, who moshed with me at the Dropkick Murphys show, who stayed up late handing out candy on Halloween, who held my hand through every bad day and stayed calm while helping me look for my keys for the hundredth time — didn’t really belong here.

He stood there, silent and solid, trapped in between somewhere neither here nor there.

It took every ounce of strength to say, “I just need some air."" It felt so forced and he knew it too.

“I’ll keep the porch light on,” he said. 

I stepped outside, greeted by a cool evening breeze that should have promised relief but delivered nothing.

Behind me, I heard the door click shut — but the silence that followed was louder than any goodbye.

\---

It’s been almost a week now since I left. 

 Evan texted a few times — short things. *Miss you.* *Just let me know you’re okay.* *I’m still here when you’re ready to come back.*

I don’t know what to say back. I keep writing drafts and deleting them. I miss him —  of course I do. But every time I think about going back, I remember the mirror. 

 And now I’ve started catching things. Small things. My reflection blinking out of sync,  a smile that comes a half-second late. One night I thought I saw my own hand move before I did.

I haven’t looked at a mirror directly in days.

I wash my face using the little black square of my phone with the screen off. I brush my teeth with my eyes closed. 

 At work, I avoid the wine bar’s mirror like it’s a live wire.

Sometimes I still hear that whisper — *Shhh* — like it’s waiting for me to slip. To let my guard down.

\---

One night, without meaning to, I found myself driving near the house again.

The porch light was still on. 

I kept driving. 

For a moment, I thought I saw Evan in the window — just standing there perfectly still, as if waiting for me.

Or maybe it was the other guy in the reflection.

It's hard to tell anymore.

But I do know one thing: I can never look at mirrors the same way again.",1,1751763525.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Ever feel like you're just throwing cash into a black hole when it comes to using AI tools? You’re not alone! The tech landscape moves faster than your morning coffee can kick in – and let's be honest, many of us are just trying to keep up. So, how do we navigate this chaos without burning a hole in our wallets? Let’s dive in! 🚀

**Here’s the deal:** 

⚡️ **Use what works, discard what doesn’t:** 
You ever get shiny object syndrome? I know I have! All those AI tools promising to revolutionize your creative process can feel like candy on a shelf. But before you whip out your debit card, take a step back:

- **Do your research**: Find genuine reviews or ask fellow creators. 
- **Start small**: Try free trials or lower-tier packages first. Don’t go full-on gold-plated version until you know it works for YOU!

🤔 **Is AI really a miracle worker?** 
Let's be real – AI can feel downright magical sometimes, but it’s not a replacement for our creativity. It’s more like a turbo boost. Think of it as your trusty sidekick instead of a new superhero in town. 

- **Text generation**: Struggling to find the right words? Tools like ChatGPT can help you brainstorm ideas or even write drafts. Just remember! They’re here to assist, not do the heavy lifting.

- **Design magic**: Ever tried Canva’s AI features? It’s like having a tiny graphic designer in your pocket. If you’re not using it yet, you might be missing out on some sweet designs without the price tag of hiring a pro! 

💰 **Stop the leaks!** 
It’s so easy to lose track of what you’re spending on these tools. We’ve all been there – signing up for everything and anything. Let’s tame that budget beast. 

- **Make a list**: Write down every tool you’re subscribed to and the cost. This can be eye-opening. 
- **Choose your essentials**: Keep only what genuinely helps you. Those tools that you haven't touched in months? Yeah, time to let ‘em go.

And hey, speaking of losing money—don’t forget the ‘trendy’ AI tools that pop up like daisies. Sure, it’s tempting to hop on every new bandwagon, but consider:

- **Is it truly valuable?** What’s the longevity of this tool?

1lsot6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1lsot6s/bachelorette_weekend_vent/,Bachelorette weekend vent,"This is going to be long and I would like to apologize. I need to vent. I gathered a group of 8 girlfriends and asked them to give me dates that would work for them so that we could have a weekend away. My sister and another girl will be (both) my maids of honor. One of the other girls had a baby a year ago and I wanted to be helpful to her so I decided that instead of a weekend away we could rent a place in our city for the weekend so that the new mom could come and go as she pleased (the place I rented is 5 minutes from her house). They all wanted to chip in for the house, which came to 106€ each for the entire weekend. I told them they only had to pay for that if they insisted but everything else would be on me since I didn't want my bachelorette to be a burden on anyone and one of the girls had recently lost her job. They all happily agreed. The place had a pool and therefore we agreed that we wouldn't have to go to the beach as we could all just chill at the house. I bought them coffees, breakfast, all meals, I got them bachelorette gifts and wrote them letters to express my gratitude that they all took the time to celebrate the big step I'm about to take. On day 1 the lady who rented us the house told me that there had been a misunderstanding and that the agreed price was per day and not for the entire weekend. I suddenly had to cover the rest of the money for the place because of course I wouldn't ask them to suddenly pay double for the place. Before you ask how that happened- the lady who rented us the house is a family friend and nothing was in writing. It was her word against mine. So I decided that I'll be broke for the rest of the month and just paid the rest of the money myself. This caused me a lot of stress but I didn't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable. Then, the next day my sister (and maid of honor) woke me up because she wanted to go to the beach and not stay at the house. When I argued that we didn't plan on a beach day she said ""okay i guess we'll just spend the day bored at the pool then"". I felt sad the entire day but tried to not show it. My sister has always been bossy and a bit blunt but she actually never means to be mean. It's just who she is. Then, I took them out for an expensive meal. I had already told them that it was my treat. The whole meal was awkward but I couldn't tell why. Everyone seemed off and moody. When the bill came, my sister who had suggested the beach day said ""we're all paying by card"" to which I replied that no one had to pay as I will be taking care of the bill. I paid and we left. When we came home, two of the girls who are closer to each other in general asked to speak to me privately. They told me that my sister made them feel uncomfortable because her vibe was off with them at the dinner and that they felt like she was talking about them. I told them that my sister likes them and that she would never speak badly about anyone right in their face but they insisted that they both got a horrible attitude from her. Also, they told me that when she suggested we all pay by card they felt uncomfortable as they couldn't afford the meal. I told them that I would never make them pay for such an expensive meal and that I'm sorry if they felt uncomfortable but there was never an intention for it. The rest of the night was weird, I looked upset but couldn't talk about it and although we had planned on getting brunch the next day before we all went home I just didn't feel up for it anymore. I asked them to just go the next day and maybe grab a quick breakfast before we leave instead. 

Is there anything I could have done differently? I feel horrible. I feel like I disappointed them all and that were all going to look back on this weekend as the worst bachelorette ever. I also feel like I didn't get to celebrate anything really. Am I overreacting? 

Edit: 2 of the girls pulled out of the plan on day 1 and never showed up and didn't pay their share so I covered that cost too myself. ",0,1751763318.0,wedding,4,0.5,False

Planning a shower for my sister and due to her guest list (50 people) time and budget will be tight. I’d like to have two tables to put gifts on based on whether the guest DOES or DOES NOT want it to be opened in front of them. Still figuring out the wording, but aiming for something like “please open today while we are all gathered” and “savor the joy, feel free to unwrap at home”. 

I personally do not want to stand around and watch 50 gifts be opened and I remember the gifts taking ages at my own shower. 

Would this be tacky?

The shower is at a coffee shop that I’ve rented for the afternoon and it’s a private event. It’s only 2 hours and I’m want to be sure there’s still time for socializing, a couple of quick games/door prizes, charcuterie, lattes and dessert.

1lsoqlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1lsoqlh/my_story_so_far_2_weeks_post_op/,My story so far 2 weeks post op,"Hi all, I am 48m in Canada and have had a terrible attack with an amazing post-op so wanted to share in case it helps others. 

Background:
For the past 4-5 years I’ve had random urq pain that was an 8-9 /10 and radiated to the back. These episodes happened about every 6 months, but I had no idea what it was. I assumed gas and googled how to deal with it (palpitate the stomach, knees to chest rolls, popping gas-x like crazy etc) and after a couple hours it would go away. One episode was so bad I thought it was a heart attack and my wife called an ambulance. Everything looked good to them and the pain passed. I just assumed it was a result of my lifestyle and weight (5’11 and 225) so sucked it up. 

Recent experience:
Well over the last few months I started having attacks every 3 weeks. Pain 8-9 lasting a couple hours. For the next day or two felt like somebody punched me hard in the guts. I figured it wasn’t right and went to the clinic. They had me do bloodwork to rule out h.pylori and scheduled me for an ultrasound for gallstones. Bloodwork was fine, and scan was a long way off. They advised to go to er if I had an attack as they would scan right away. 

I didn’t listen, and had 2 more attacks at inconvenient times (like midnight) and thought still I just need to suck it up. 

The last attack:
Had an attack on a Wednesday that was a 10 out of 10. Same pain urq and went away after 2 hours. On Thursday I woke up and didn’t feel great, but work at home so did my usual. Worked for the morning, had lunch, then started to not feel great again. At 2:30 I had another 10/10 attack. By 5 pm it hadn’t gone away and the pain shifted to more mid stomach and felt different. My wife came home from work and I said we need to go to emerge. I tried to stand up and then said nope, call an ambulance. They came and got me. I have an autoimmune disorder (ocular myasthenia gravis) and am non-symptomatic right now, but they couldn’t give me any pain meds just in case. They bundled me up and took me to the er. They warned me it wouldn’t get me in faster but at least they could get me checked in. 

The ER experience:
The ER was very busy, so I had to get off the stretcher and sit in a wheelchair for about 2 hours. That sucked as my pain was consistent the entire time and sitting up was awful. Luckily I’m not in a big urban setting and it wasn’t 12 hours!

The staff took blood and eventually I saw a doctor. I was able to lie down in the exam and he did his initial checks. Then he got the bloodwork results. He said I had acute pancreatitis likely caused by gallstones. I asked what that meant and he said it means you aren’t leaving. My numbers: lipase level off the charts at >3500 - target is 12-53; ggpt at 692 - target <73, and ALT with P5P 965 - target <55. I don’t know what the number mean other than it wasn’t good. 

They immediately got me a bed, hooked me up to an IV full open, and gave me shots of dilauded in the arm. I spent 2 days in the ER getting fluids and pain & nausea meds (and peeing every 30 minutes!!!!) and nothing else. The staff were amazing, but I was in a hallway and every time I got anywhere close to sleep it was time for bloodwork or blood pressure or some alarm was going off. 

They did an ultrasound and the tech smiled and simply said good luck with your surgery. The doc came by later and said I had multiple stones up to 13mm. 

They said I was going to emergency surgery, but they couldn’t tell me when as more critical patients would bump me. 

Surgery:
Finally went in for surgery late Saturday evening. They put massage things on my legs to keep blood pressure up and the anesshititst told me because of my acid reflux and OMG they needed to put me under fast. He said I would feel someone choking me as they needed to apply pressure to stop the thing in my neck from opening, but honestly as soon as the mask hit my face I was out like a light. Apparently I woke up in recovery and asked if I could keep the gallbladder but the surgeon said no. Bastards 🤷‍♂️😂. Overall the surgery was successful. They did laparoscopic with 4 entry points including the belly button. 

Recovery:
Later that night I woke up in the room and they brought me a couple yogurts. I texted my wife and said it was the best yogurt I’ve ever had in my life. She says I was stoned. I didn’t feel any pain and slept so well that night. 

The next morning I had coffee (omg!!!) oatmeal, and dry toast. They made sure I was passing gas and not in too much pain. I was feeling pretty good so they let me go home by lunch with prescriptions for hydromorphone. I only wound up taking 1 that night and switched to 2 extra strength Tylenol every 4 hours. The pain was there, but not even close to gallstones. Maybe a 4. I was tired and not very hungry. Stuck to saltines, plain rice, apple sauce etc. had some chicken soup on day 3 and that brought on my first BM. First one was normal, the next bunch was like liquid hot lava. But by day 5 I was fine and being more adventurous. 

By day 7 we went to the brewery and I had half a cheeseburger and salad and a beer. It’s now 2 weeks post-op and I’m eating normally. 

Here’s what is different for me than other stories I’ve read. I feel fantastic! I’m sleeping better than I have in years, I’ve lost 10 pounds from my pre-op weight, and my poops are good. I had years of bad sleep, acid reflux daily, and runny/loose stool. I assume that my gallbladder has been causing all kinds of problems I just didn’t realize. Don’t know if this will change over time but I sure hope not. 

I followed doctors orders and rested for a week, then went back to work. Have been mindful of not lifting anything and being really gentle. I feel great, but definitely tired with any kind of exertion as I heal. 

My only complication is in my mouth. They must have scraped inside my jaw when they intubated me, and 2 weeks on that’s sore and tender. Taking ibuprofen to manage swelling. 

Conclusion:
I would have preferred not getting pancreatitis! I should have dealt with my symptoms sooner, but the surgery was simple and sooooooo worth it. And I’m so glad I’m in Canada where I didn’t have to think about the costs vs my health!

Happy to answer any questions!

1lsomjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1lsomjd/how_long_does_it_take_to_make_cold_brew_coffee/,How long does it take to make cold brew coffee?,"As a coffee lover, I've always been fascinated by cold brew coffee. It's smooth, less acidic, and perfect for those hot summer days. But one question that kept popping up in my mind was: how long does it really take to make cold brew coffee?

Well, I've done my research and experimented a bit, and I'm here to share what I've learned. The short answer is: it typically takes between 12 to 24 hours to make cold brew coffee. But there's more to it than just that.

The process of making cold brew coffee is pretty simple. You start by steeping coarse ground coffee in cold water for an extended period. This slow extraction process is what gives cold brew its unique flavor profile.

Here's a basic breakdown of the time involved:

1. Grinding the beans: 5-10 minutes
2. Setting up the brew: 5 minutes
3. Steeping time: 12-24 hours
4. Straining: 5-10 minutes

The longest part, as you can see, is the steeping time. This is where patience comes into play. The longer you let it steep, the stronger and more concentrated your cold brew will be.

But why does it take so long? Unlike hot brewing methods, cold water doesn't extract the coffee's oils and flavors as quickly. The slow process allows for a gentler extraction, resulting in a smoother, less bitter taste.

Now, you might be thinking, ""That's a long time to wait for coffee!"" And you're right. But trust me, it's worth it. The resulting brew can be stored in the fridge for up to two weeks, so you can make a big batch and enjoy it for days.

If you're like me and don't want to wait that long every time you crave a cold brew, there are some great iced coffee makers out there that can speed up the process. I recently discovered a fantastic selection at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. These machines are designed to make the cold brew process more efficient and convenient.

One thing to keep in mind is that the steeping time can vary depending on your personal taste preferences. Some people prefer a lighter brew and might stop the process after 12 hours, while others like a stronger flavor and let it steep for the full 24 hours or even longer.

Temperature also plays a role. If you're brewing at room temperature, it might take less time than if you're brewing in the fridge. Room temperature brewing can be done in about 12-18 hours, while fridge brewing might take 18-24 hours.

Another factor that affects brewing time is the grind size of your coffee. Coarser grinds take longer to extract, while finer grinds speed up the process but might result in a more bitter taste.

If you're new to cold brew, I'd recommend starting with a 16-hour steep time and adjusting from there based on your taste preferences. Experiment with different times and ratios until you find your perfect brew.

For those who want to dive deeper into the world of cold brew, there are some great resources and tools available. The iced coffee makers I mentioned earlier from https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers can be a game-changer for cold brew enthusiasts.

In conclusion, while making cold brew coffee does require some patience, the end result is well worth the wait. The smooth, rich flavor of a well-brewed cold brew is hard to beat. And remember, with the right tools and a bit of practice, you can streamline the process and enjoy delicious cold brew coffee whenever you want.

So, are you ready to give cold brew a try? Or if you're already a fan, what's your preferred steeping time? Happy brewing!",1,1751762716.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

“Why are you awake, Lilya?” he asked softly, watching her from beneath those thick, dark lashes of his. 

“I can’t sleep in that room,” she admitted. “It’s everything in there—the aquarium, the light, the loveseat, Solas… I sleep better in a bedroll on the ground than I do in there.” 

“You need rest.” 

“Says the assassin who tries not to sleep,” she said, teasing him with a pointed look over the rim of her cup. 

“You’re not an abomination in danger of being walked over a ledge if you fall asleep.” 

“No, but I am in danger of having to bandy words with Solas if I do.” She ran a hand through her dark hair and heaved a sigh. “Or of seeing D’Metas Crossing in my dreams. Or what became of the qamek master. Or any of the other awful things we’ve seen.”

He hummed thoughtfully and drank more coffee. “That’s why you always nap in the library.” 

She nodded. “It’s a little safer, I think. And there’s no Fade fish staring at me.” 

He huffed his amusement. “I’ll admit I don’t understand how you can’t swim. You grew up in Dock Town, right on the water.” 

Lilya didn’t fully manage to suppress her shudder at the memory of cold water closing in around her, the brine stinging her eyes and nose as she floundered. The way her cries were stolen by the sea, the sound of her thrashing hidden by the slap of water on the docks and distant shouting of dockhands. The gnawing, sinking numbness from the icy current leeching the warmth from her limbs. 

“I had a bad experience in my youth and tried to avoid the water afterwards,” she muttered, glaring darkly into the depths of her cup. 

His hand lifted and froze, like he’d intended to offer comfort but second-guessed himself. In a blink, that hand was clenched atop his leg. “It may behoove you to learn—in a safe, controlled environment, of course.” 

“Like the baths?” Lilya tried to make a joke of it, but the humor fell flat. He’d had to pull her out of a deep stretch of river in Arlathan not too long ago. The image of her, water-logged and shaking uncontrollably, was probably a hard one to forget. So much for the facade of “fearless leader.” 

“Possibly. You could at least learn to float there.” 

She shook her head. “I don’t think I want to be scared witless of my only source for a hot bath.” 

“Fair enough. I’ll think of something.” 

“Will you also teach me?” 

“I will. For a price.” He held up a foil-covered square of chocolate, a tiny smirk appearing at her gasp. She hadn’t even seen him move, much less heard the bag crinkle.

The first picture was taken on May 31st. I had just turned 29 a few days before, but I felt so much older. I couldn’t imagine wasting the last year of my 20s feeling bloated, lethargic, and riddled with hangxiety. Alcohol had snuck up on me, until I realized my tolerance was increasing. It scared me when I realized that I needed to drink two big white claws instead of one to feel the same effect. So I took this picture and decided to give myself just one month to take a break from alcohol. Something had to change. So I made a deal with myself that if I hated sobriety, I could go back to drinking in July. 

I took the second picture this afternoon, a month and some change after my last sip of alcohol. For all of you who are lurking like I was, on the fence about quitting: there is not a single facet of my life that has not been improved by cutting out drinking. I lost 5 pounds, my skin is glowing, I am super hydrated because I’m not replacing water with hard seltzers, I have the energy to exercise daily, and my house is organized because I’m not too hungover to clean. Also, the sleep. Oh my god, the sleep! I don’t remember sleeping this well since I was a kid! 

If anyone is wondering if it’s really worth it to quit, I promise it is. There have been moments where I was triggered to drink, but waking up without a hangover is the best feeling! 

Things that helped me:

1. Fun nonalc beverages! Lacroix, Diet Coke, coffee, tea, and kombucha are lifesavers 

2. When you are hit with a craving, tell yourself you have to wait one hour. Then do some jumping jacks or pushups, call a friend, go for a walk, clean your bathroom, try a new recipe, do literally anything to distract yourself. If you can just surf the craving, it does go away. 

3. Don’t say “I can’t drink.” Say “I don’t drink.” It makes a difference. 

4. This Naked Mind is great! I also like Alcohol Explained by William Porter. Once I truly realized that alcohol was actually poisoning me and shortening my lifespan, it made me see it not as a fun pastime but as something dangerous.

It was nice and warm today, though for thirty it certainly wasn't as boiling as I'd expect it to be. Probably do to the flash of rain. It drove me inside again but only for a minute or two. I still found plenty of time to write. I first made some notes in my book about the Danaides; there are fifty of them and though they aren't the main characters, I went to give each of them some semblance of character. I'll be introducing them in the second chapter so I want to get at least a sentence down about each of their personalities before we get there. I started working on those notes yesterday and tonight I already have 33 done. I'll probably try to get a few more done over my even coffee. As for I'm Still Sisyphus itself, I wrote around 700 words today. A fine start to the chapter. It may end up being shorter than the first; I suppose it depends on how many pages it takes to properly introduce each prisoner of tartarus. We shall see.

As for the garden, the Japanese beetles have arrived. There's been signs of them all week but we actually saw them for the first time in the garden today. We put up some traps and they seem to be attracting them very well. We'll see how well it actually traps them tomorrow. The garden itself is going well. I am anxious to get some peppers for myself soon. We don't have a lot of vegetables left at the moment. We'll be pulling the garlic soon too. My roses died back just in time to avoid the onslaught of beetles but I can't give them a good trim until the garlics out of the way.

Oh, and a piece of my tooth chipped off. A tiny peach from behind the tooth, thank goodness, so you can't really see it. Still, it is another cavity now I have to spend more time and money on the dentist. I can admit me putting it off surely doesn't help. That doesn't mean I'm not going to keep putting it off. I probably won't go in until the end of summer or until the cavity becomes noticeable; whichever comes first. Yes, I know that's not healthy but what am I to do when it is so fucking expensive? It as bad as getting new glasses.

Well, I'm going to relax for the night. I'm still a little achy from all the walking yesterday. And my fingers hurt from all of today's typing. I need the break. Who knows if I'll actually give it to myself.

Yours & Mine,

## Key Features Analysis

The ⁤most effective stroller ⁣cup holders boast a combination of adaptability, stability,⁤ and durability. The ⁤highest rated options offer‌ versatility‍ across diffrent stroller types and drink sizes, ensuring convenience ⁢and reliability.

**Universal⁣ Compatibility:** this feature refers⁤ to the cup ⁤holder's ability to attach to a wide range of stroller ⁣models, including those with different⁤ frame shapes and ‌sizes. ⁣Universal cup holders typically utilize adjustable clamp mechanisms or straps that can be tightened or ⁣loosened to fit various stroller handles or frames. Look for models‌ that ‍specify compatibility with ‌both round and square frames for maximum versatility.

A Universal design ensures that parents won't need‍ to⁣ purchase separate cup‌ holders for each of their strollers, saving both‌ time​ and money. The ability⁢ to​ switch the ‌cup holder between different⁣ strollers also provides⁤ added convenience for families with multiple children or caregivers.The ‌majority of universal options will also feature tool-free installation, a major consideration ​for busy parents.

**Secure ​Attachment System:** This feature⁣ relates to how firmly the cup holder attaches‌ to the stroller frame and⁢ prevents it‌ from slipping or rotating during use. ⁤Secure ​attachment ‍systems often incorporate rubberized grips, screw-tightening mechanisms, or ⁢strong velcro straps to ensure ⁤a stable connection. The goal is to keep the cup holder in place even when the stroller is jostled or⁢ encounters uneven terrain.

A secure attachment system ⁤is crucial for preventing spills and ⁣messes while strolling. A well-designed system will minimize movement and vibration,⁤ keeping drinks⁣ upright and secure. Look for⁣ cup holders with ⁤positive locking mechanisms for​ added security and peace of mind.⁢ Make⁤ sure to check ⁣reviews‍ from parents regarding different⁤ strollers to ‌see which is the best attachment for your style.**Adjustable Cup Size Accommodation:** One of the‌ most critically importent aspects of​ a stroller cup holder is its capability to hold different‌ sized cups from small bottled‍ water to large⁢ travel ‍mugs.⁢ The cup holder should have ⁣an⁣ adjustable design, ‍frequently enough with flexible ⁢grips or ‍inserts, to accommodate various diameters and ⁣heights.

flexibility ⁣in cup size accommodation ensures ⁢that parents can ‍use their favorite drinks without ‍worrying about⁣ them falling ⁣out or not fitting ⁣properly. an adjustable design also allows parents​ to switch‌ between different types of cups, such​ as sippy‍ cups,‌ disposable coffee cups, or reusable water bottles.⁢ The range of sizes accommodated should be a decision factor.

**Durable Construction Materials:** This feature pertains to the ‍quality of materials ​used ​to ‍construct the cup holder,which directly ⁢impacts its lifespan and ‍resistance to wear and tear.Durable construction materials, such as high-grade⁢ plastics, stainless steel,⁢ or reinforced nylon, are essential for withstanding daily use and exposure to the elements.

A Rugged construction ensures that the cup holder⁤ will not crack,‌ break, or degrade over⁤ time, providing long-lasting performance. The selection of well-made and durable materials should be resistant to impacts, UV damage, ‍and extreme temperatures, ensuring that it can withstand a variety of weather conditions⁤ and⁤ activities. cup holders constructed from these materials‍ will generally last longer and⁤ require less⁢ frequent replacement.

**Easy to Clean Design:**⁤ Spills ‍are almost inevitable when you ⁤have​ drinkware so close to child and regular life. Thus, the practical cup holder is easy to clean and disinfect. Look⁢ for cup holders with smooth surfaces, removable inserts,‌ or dishwasher-safe ‍components.

An Easy to clean design saves time and effort⁤ for busy ‍parents and helps maintain hygiene. Regular cleaning prevents the build-up of grime, stains, and ⁣odors, keeping the cup holder looking and smelling fresh. Some cup holders feature drainage‌ holes to allow liquids to escape, further simplifying ​the cleaning process.

## Core Benefits

Stroller cup holders offer a ‌range of practical benefits that enhance the overall convenience and enjoyment‌ of⁣ stroller use, from⁢ keeping​ drinks secure to ⁤freeing up parents' hands. These benefits contribute to‍ a more organized ​and stress-free ‌strolling experience.

**Enhanced Convenience:** Cup ​holders provide a convenient and ⁣accessible storage solution for beverages and other small items, freeing up parents’ hands and allowing ‍them to focus ‌on​ pushing and navigating ​the stroller. This enhanced convenience simplifies daily tasks such as running errands, going for ‍walks, or⁣ visiting the park with children.

No longer will parents juggle a coffee,‍ phone, and baby at the same time. With drinks readily accessible and securely held, parents can easily‌ take​ a sip without stopping or setting down their belongings which ‌results in a more relaxed ⁤and efficient outing. Improved accessibility can make ‍family outings significantly more enjoyable because of this ⁤very reason.

**Improved ⁤Safety:** Properly designed cup holders reduce the risk of spills and accidents by providing ⁣a⁤ stable and secure place to hold drinks, minimizing the chances of scalding ​liquids spilling and possibly harming the child.⁢ The stable place for the ⁢beverage ‌reduces⁢ the risks ​of distractions from trying to ⁢hold ⁢beverages.

By keeping drinks upright and preventing spills, cup holders contribute⁤ to a cleaner and safer environment for both ​the child and ⁣parent. A secure cup ⁣holder ‌also minimizes⁢ the likelihood of slippery surfaces underneath the wheels.

**Increased Organization:** ⁣A Stroller with a cup holder installed helps maintain a more ⁣organized stroller setup,keeping drinks within easy reach and preventing​ clutter in the stroller ⁣basket or ‍pockets. Some cup holders⁤ also feature additional⁢ compartments or trays for storing small​ essentials ⁣like⁢ keys, phones, or snacks.

An Organized stroller​ makes it ⁢easier for parents‍ to locate and access items⁢ quickly, reducing frustration and saving time. An organized stroller will also help to keep any area ⁢used for stroller parking ⁤tidy, whether it is indeed a park bench⁣ or a hallway.

**Versatile Utility:**⁢ Many‌ cup holders are designed⁤ to accommodate⁣ not only⁢ drinks ​but also other small items like phones, ‌keys, wallets,‍ or even small snacks, providing a versatile storage solution for parents on the go. This versatility increases ⁣the cup‍ holder's overall value⁣ and‍ functionality, making it a ⁣useful⁤ accessory for a wide ‍range ⁢of activities.

multipurpose cup holders ⁢with extra storage can ​help streamline the stroller⁤ setup, eliminating the need for separate pouches or​ bags⁣ to hold essential items.​ This ⁢versatility adds ​to convenience⁢ and ‍ease of use,making it easier ​to ‍manage outings.

1lsofnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1lsofnc/bitcoin_is_survival_seriously/,Bitcoin is survival... seriously,"Life’s just… a lot, dont you reckon? Seriously, it really is.

I’m in my late 30s, got three kids, and I’ve been wrestling with chronic pain for 15 years. Out of those 15, I've been out of work for six. The other six I have worked only part-time. As a result my earning potential has been smashed. My 401K / Superannuation has been impacted. I held a manager role for a few years but I struggled to keep it going. I even got my Masters. My wife’s pulling 60-hour weeks just to keep us afloat because of my lack of work. After getting discharged from the Army, I can’t shake this feeling that I’m just a burden on my family. That obviously has had implication on my MH. I always hoped and dreamed of going to work in a suit and earning a good wicket to support the family. Drive into work in a family car and coffee in hand. Some great work colleagues that end up being good buddies where we share a meal after work once a week. A supportive boss who actually humanises their staff. I've always been ambitious however chronic pain eats at that ambition slowly... until the ambition is over powered by exhaustion.

I’ve honestly tried to do things right. We managed to save a good chunk of cash in past years, but then it all got wiped out. First, by moving whenever the cold weather made my pain unbearable, and then by inflation just eating away at it. After that, we were basically forced to buy a place because finding stable housing here is a nightmare. Long-term leases just aren’t a thing, and with vacancy rates near zero every time a 6 or 12-month lease was up, we were looking at huge rent hikes or getting told to leave which led to the possibility of homelessness (as the owners were looking to sell due to the never ending appreciation of property). I remember we had our second child at the time and I was making calls to family and asking them if I could move in with them (in a different state and on the other side of the country). I felt terrible asking and there was a bit of reluctance for us to move in which is completely reasonable. They didn't say no, but we had 2 kids at that point and 2 dogs. Why I was evening asking somebody to move in with them in my mid 30s was just beyond me anyway. Especially in a country that called itself 'the lucky country'. My daughter was around 18 months at the time and the prospect of homelessness was just too much hence why I reluctantly bought a house.

We ended up buying a modest home, but even that mortgage eats up a massive chunk of our income. It’s no shock that most politicians in this country own property, so housing policy has been super favorable to them for decades – big conflict of interest, right? Houses here are just speculative assets; people literally buy and flip them. Alternatively, they hoard property, and property has become one of the most popular ways to build wealth over here. It just doesn't sit right with me. Property should be valued on its utility. It is security for people. It’s like a money cheat code at this point. Houses just keep going up. This whole idea of accumulating as many houses as possible has been pushed for generations, and it’s a huge problem.

And don’t even get me started on groceries. A hundred bucks gets you practically nothing these days. Two companies have a chokehold on the food supply chain and seem to be price gouging like crazy. The ACCC has barely done anything to fix it. As long as the shareholders get their dividends, I guess.

So, when you add it all up – taxes, insurance, food, childcare, mortgage payments – we really don’t have much left to actually invest in anything meaningful. It feels like we’re going to be stuck on a hamster wheel for the rest of our lives. Financial independence isn’t about lounging around and doing nothing. It’s about having the power to walk away from a job when you’re being bullied, take a shot at a business idea, spend more time with your kids, give them opportunities for extracurricular, travel and experience other cultures, or just take time off when you’re sick. There are hundreds of reasons why financial security matters, and it’s definitely not just about ""buying a Lambo.""

Anyway, I have zero doubt that a lot of people have turned to Bitcoin because of the sheer pressure of life and how unfairly money is distributed (even worse in developing nations). Buttcoiners can back the Central Bankers (likely have benefited from the trad-fi status quo) all they want, but the truth is, the free market and everyday folks are eventually going to find their way to Bitcoin. It just kind of… finds you, when you’re completely out of ideas and options.

This is what happened to me. Bitcoin found me. I like sharing the above stories because somebody else might resonate with it and/or going through a difficult time with their financial security. 

PS I am fully aware and acknowledge that while our circumstances are difficult I totally appreciate this is likely x10 worse in developing countries and my heart goes out to you especially when governments are continually making conflicted poor choices to benefit those with influence (ie these endless wars).

TLDR: Basically found Bitcoin due to desperation and out of choices to escape the hampster wheel.",23,1751762124.0,Bitcoin,9,0.93,False
1lsoe93,https://www.reddit.com/r/SillyTavernAI/comments/1lsoe93/sillytavern_systemprompts_and_english_in_general/,SillyTavern system-prompts and English in general,"So I'm not really a commenter let alone being a poster. So if things are really bad, I'm sorry in advance.

Almost after finishing this post I realized that I also should mention the model I'm using.  
Pantheon RP 22B Q6\_K\_L (version 1.6.2 - GGUF)  
So what I wrote here is mostly applies to a model that is tuned for rp and it will be different with other models. But as far as I'm aware same thing also applies to ChatGPT 4o model...

On to the topic... Now I want to talk about (share my ideas and maybe info dump a little) default system-prompts of SillyTavern. This is not really limited to SillyTavern *-or system prompts, the things I wrote also applies to character cards and personas.* And you can try to use it anywhere you can, I guess?. The rest of the post is what I ""discovered"" while messing around and they are not the ""best"" approaches by no means. It is how models actually interprets the language and I may be totally wrong.

Roleplay - Immersive  
""""""  
\[System note: Write one reply only. Do not decide what {{user}} says or does. Write at least one paragraph, up to four. Be descriptive and immersive, providing vivid details about {{char}}'s actions, emotions, and the environment. Write with a high degree of complexity and burstiness. Do not repeat this message.\]  
""""""

Now when it comes to LLMs they don't take things at face value. They are looking almost all the possible ""meanings"" of the words that might mean in a sentence/context. And they stretch the meaning exponentially with the Parameter Size (the 7B and  12B part of the model). So the rest of my TED rant is going to be the embodiment of ""dad jokes"" but this just how LLMs work... Once again sorry in advance :D

Starting with the ""Do not decide what {{user}} says or does"". Now ""doing"" something -as we use- means that ""waking around"" or ""I get out of the couch to get a coffee"" kind of actions. But when a model sees this they go with *-especially the high parameter ones-* also considers describing what user ""sees"" as something that ""{{user}} does"". Like I said they stretch the meaning and it may be good for regular conversations that is not what we look when roleplaying. Now by itself this might just be minor problem that model can overcome by saying things like ""{{char}} saw a big flying shark on the street."" but with the next one...

""Be descriptive and immersive, providing vivid details about {{char}}'s actions, emotions, and the environment"". Now the model is choking... because if ""seeing, hearing..."" is something that ""{{user}} does"" model can't describe the scenes. Now the model is just trying to find a safe response that will not break the system-prompt and most of time just stalls the conversation...

""Write with a high degree of complexity and burstiness"" this may not be a problem but what do ""complexity"" means to an LLM? A ""short, non-descriptive and non-vivid"" response is also a complex response.

(The next part is not totally related with what I was talking about up to this point.)

""Do not repeat this message"". I never tried this prompt without this sentence so I don't know whether the model will print this one. If it is printing something you put to system-prompt it mostly means that model is extremely confused and starts to use a safety net.  
This might happen due to persona / character card conflicts. It may be prompt / character conflicts. But the more contradicting things have, the more model will try backoff. As an example if the character card has short dialogs as an example or says something like ""{{char}} talks short."" it will also cause confusion to the model.

 ""Write one reply only.""... This is just confuses our lovely, lovely models... Because they already generating ""one reply only"" and they try to find out what this means. And to be honest I also have no idea of ""what it is trying to limit with model"" but hey, I'm just a chaos gremlin \*totally not an LLM, sadly\*  so it might just be my brain that is confused.

Now if you read so far, you are probably asking one of those two things. Either ""This person has no idea about the current level we are. Is he just a starter?"" or ""Yeah we get it you love to talk bad about what other people are doing. But do you have anything that is better than this?""  
For the first one, I'm sorry I had no idea.  
For the second one, I'm sorry I was not trying to be mean... I was just so hyped and wanted to info dump :(

But with all seriousness here is what I found a little bit more cooperative and story progressing system-prompt... But the system-prompt alone will not save you from the conflicts of persona/character. It is also important which model you are using etc. you get the idea..  
my system-prompt right now  
""""""  
Develop the plot. Describe all actions in full, elaborate, and vivid details. You can use explicit and/or graphic descriptions when needed. Mention relevant sensory perceptions as they arise naturally. Keep the story immersive and engaging. You may describe what happens to the {{user}} using second person point of view, including how the environment or events affect them. Do not write the {{user}}’s dialogue, decisions, or internal thoughts. Remain consistent with the character card’s personality and preferences. If a decision is needed, present it to the user with clear choices or open-ended questions. You may describe the outcome of {{user}}'s actions or choices, including wins, losses, or unexpected events, as long as it fits the tone and keeps the story engaging.  
""""""

now you might say that this is not a system-prompt but a short system story... which I would agree but let me break it down and talk about the parts I find important and why I did them so you can just take what you want. Also you can and even encouraged to nitpick my system-prompt... Yeah the part about English in general comes into play here... LLMs knows more nuance and usage ways of the words than I do... This is why I'm trying to confirm whether it is a good system-prompt in general :D anyway back to topic...

The most fun addition that I had to the system-prompt was this lovely part  
""You may describe the outcome of {{user}}'s actions or choices, including wins, losses, or unexpected events, as long as it fits the tone and keeps the story engaging.""  
This part here is what makes the story progress. I say ""I get up and take a coffee."" and model says that ""You are poisoned from the coffee."" or model makes you lose the bet and make you to pay for the drinks.... I still hate that I lost that bet... 

this part ""You may describe what happens to the {{user}} using second person point of view, including how the environment or events affect them."" is here because;

* If I'm in a tavern brawl, and there is a huge muscly person that ""can"" take me up and ""throw me to the wall to make me hug the wall involuntarily"" I want model to describe that. Now even though this is not something I do as a user, it is still an action that user ""does"". Even if it is not what I wanted.
* And if you want to be the strongest in the world and don't want model to throw you around write that in your persona. Because if that is in your persona model will go ""Huge person hits you with a sledgehammer. You only feel like something is bumped to you.""

But in the both cases you either feel something or get into an action and I want the model to be able to come up with that kind of scenes.

this part ""Remain consistent with the character card’s personality and preferences."" pretend like you are the {{char}} and talk like them but you can also be narrator. You can leave the character to narrate the story and keep things going. But know the difference between character and narrator difference.

Also I'm new to both roleplaying and LLM roleplaying... I think it's been a week since I started with Local LLMs. I might be really really behind the curve :D  
But I think I have a good understanding on LLMs (not including roleplaying) so these are the things that I wanted to share! Because they are the things that I also see on the character cards not only for system-prompts. And this may also help with fine tuning your characters, I hope!

Thank you for listening to my TED rant!

I’m a daily Zyrtec taker for histamine issues related to hormones, PMDD, and bad seasonal allergies but am doing skin testing for random recent oral allergy syndrome-esque reactions to a variety of foods & not taking it has me struggling. 

I’ve been off Zyrtec for about a week now due to forgetting it at home before vacation & now I can’t take it because I have skin allergy testing on Tuesday (7/8). I am miserable. I’m talking pain in my eyes when I move them, headache, my voice sounds tinny in my ears because they feel clogged/pressure, throat feels tight from post nasal drip, the whole sha-bang. Surprisingly I’m not having intense itching. 

I read online that you’re supposed to even stop NSAIDs but I couldn’t take it anymore and just took Advil for the inflammation/eye pain. I’m in the STL, MO area and our AccuWeather says the dust & dander is extreme, migraines are high & sinus pressure is moderate. They’re 100% correct lol. Weirdly the allergens (ragweed, grass, etc) are showing low, despite the fluffy stuff flying around. 

Either way, I of course have been outside the last couple days doing work around the house and enjoying the holiday weekend but I had to come in because the pressure in my head and ears was making me damn near have vertigo. I also have POTS so its just making everything worse. I’m doing skin testing due to recently randomly developing these mouth/throat reactions to a bunch of foods I eat often including zucchini, potatoes, strawberries, fried foods (I think the oil is triggering me idk if that’s possible), raw veggies, tea/coffee, and a couple other things which are listed as potentially oral allergy syndrome related. I have stomach issues already and am sensitive to a lot of foods so I’m literally spiraling right now lol

The reaction I get to these foods typically involves a carpet/velvet feeling on my tongue, dry mouth/throat, tight feeling in throat, sometimes burning sensation on lips, and sometimes itchy hands which seem in line with OAS. 

So because of these reactions I can’t have any tea & because I’m suddenly intolerant to most fruits and veggies I’m basically doing a crappy unwanted carnivore diet 🥲 This morning I drank plain hot water just to have something hot to thin some of this post nasal drip in my throat & soothe the area. 

They did blood testing for some foods and they all came back negative despite reactions. 

How am I gonna make it to Tuesday like this?? 😭 are NSAIDs really going to mess up the results of the skin testing??",1,1751761932.0,Allergies,0,1.0,False

I write this post with great enthusiasm. I prepared for upsc for 4 years= 3 attempts. I have written mains once in my 2nd attempt. Felt pretty confident that i can clear mains in my 3rd but failed to clear prelims. 

I immediately switched gears. Being an engineer i worked very hard. Reskilled myself in 8 months. I used to go to malls, have coffee and used to reskill myself. Even match movie. It was dead easy when compared to upsc. After that I got a job in a big MNC. I worked hard and now i caught up with everyone in private sector.

  
Life is so happy without pressure. I reduced my weight from 108kgs to 72kgs. I look smart. I feel great. Life beyond upsc is awesome.

  
Lessons:

1) set a deadline to your aspiration

2) move on: its hard but it only takes 3 months

3) billions of other oppoertunities. 

I guess as upsc aspirants with critical thinking you need to hear all stories- success, failure, failure followed by success stories. ",5,1751761441.0,UPSC,0,1.0,False
1lso7pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lso7pj/im_being_followed_by_a_truck_thats_full_of_people/,I'm being followed by a truck that's full of people. There's a surgery going on in the cargo hold. I can see it through the glass.,"

*“What am I even looking at, here…”* I whispered to myself.

The soft clicking of my sedan’s turn signal chirped in my ear, and my fingers tapped against the steering wheel with an impatient rhythm. I turned away and attempted to keep my eyes fixed forward. Despite my best efforts,  though, I found my gaze drifting from the reddish glow of the stoplight to the reddish glow emanating from the truck.

My eyes narrowed as I scanned the enormous glass cargo hold, struggling to imagine what the purpose of such of thing could even be. There was movement inside of it, too. Some internal light fixture illuminated the people walking about the truck bed.

Initially, I couldn’t tell what they were doing.

A red curtain draped against the inside of the glass obscured my view.

Multiple human-shaped shadows flickered behind the curtain, pacing up and down the length of the eighteen-wheeler like a group of anxiety-riddled stagehands preparing for act one of a play on opening night.

Obviously, the thought was absurd. It was 3:53 in the morning. Main Street was appropriately deserted. Just me and the truck; no other vehicles in sight.

Who the hell would they even be performing for?

Icy sweat beaded on my forehead. I cranked the A/C to its highest setting. Some combination of exhaustion from my night shift and the uncanny sight was making my heart palpitate.

Then, they pulled back the curtain.

It was a devastatingly familiar scene. My breath came out in ragged gasps. Hot nausea creeped up the back of throat.

The shining steel table. Honeycombed overhead lights like monstrous bug-eyes. Drills. Scalpels. Monitors with video feeds displaying the table from every conceivable angle. Away from the table, a flock of subordinates, attired in sterile gowns and powdered gloves, remained still.

They waited for their leader’s command.

He was impossibly tall, hunching slightly forward to prevent his head from grazing the top of the hollow container. As if to further delineate his rank, the leader’s smock was leathery and skin toned; everyone else’s was white and cleanly pressed. Between the mask covering his mouth and the glare from the light affixed to his glasses, I couldn’t see his face.

He lumbered toward the table, fingers wrapped around the handles of a wheelchair.

The person in the wheelchair was unconscious. A young man with a mop of frizzy brown hair, naked as the day he was born. His head was dead weight, rolling across his chest he creaked forward, inch by tortuous inch.

Despite his rag-doll body, I knew his awake. Even if I couldn’t see them, I knew there was life in his eyes.

He just couldn’t move his body.

Still, they were going to perform a surgery on the poor sap.

I looked away. The traffic light was still red. I glanced at the clock.

*4:01AM*.

Without a second thought, my boot crashed onto the accelerator. I sped down Main Street. The truck became smaller and smaller in my rear-view mirror until it was just a dot of light on the horizon.

A wave of relief swept down my spine, but an intrusive thought soured my respite.

*They’ve likely started operating, and he can feel everything. The ripping of skin. The oozing of blood. His nerves are screaming.*

*He just can’t say anything.*

\- - - - - 

*“…I’m sorry Pete, run that by me again? What was so wrong with the truck?”* James asked, rubbing his temple like he had a migraine coming on.

I tore off a sheet from a nearby paper towel roll and reached over our kitchen island.

*“You’re dripping again, bud,”* I remarked.

James cocked his head at me, then looked to the wipe. He couldn’t feel the mucus dripping from the corner of his right eye, apparently. It took a few seconds for him to process the statement.

Recognition flashed across his face.

*“Oh! Shoot.”*

He grabbed the paper towel and blotted away the gelatinous teardrop - a side effect from the LASIK procedure that he had underwent a month prior.

Overall, I agreed with him: James looked better without glasses. That said, if attention from the opposite sex was the name of the game, the persistent ocular discharge that he now suffered from seemed like a bit of monkey’s paw. One step forward, two steps back.

He didn’t seem overly preoccupied with the issue.

As he crumpled the paper towel, I tried explaining what’d happened the night before. For the third time.

*“I’m driving home from a shift, idling at a stoplight, and this truck pulls up beside me. One of those big motherfuckers. Cargo hold the size of our apartment, monster-truck wheels - you get the idea. But the cargo hold, it’s this huge glass box. There’s a curtain on the inside, like they were about to debut a mobile rendition of Hamlet. But they - the people inside of the box, I forgot to mention the people - they weren’t about to perform a play. I mean, I don’t know for sure that they weren’t, but that’s besides the point. They looked like they were going to…and I know how this sounds…but they looked like they were going to perform surgery…”*

My recollection of the event crumbled. I was losing the plot. Found myself distracted by James.

Now, both sides were leaking.

I ripped another piece of paper towel off the roll and handed it to him. He was watching me, but his expression was vacant. The lights were on behind his eyes, but nobody seemed to be home. I started to wonder if he’d discontinued his ADHD meds or something.

After an uncomfortable pause, he realized *why* I was giving him more tissue paper.

*“So, what was so wrong with the truck?”* he repeated, once again blotting the tears away.

\- - - - - 

About a week passed before I saw the truck again.

That time, it was all happening in broad daylight.

I rounded a corner onto Main Street and parked my car in front of our local coffee shop, pining for my afternoon bolus of caffeine to prepare for another grueling night shift.

As I placed my hand over the cafe’s doorknob, I heard a familiar jingling noise behind me. The rattling of change against the inside of a plastic cup. A pang of guilt curled around my heart like a hungry python.

I’d walked past Danny like he didn’t even exist.

I flipped around, digging through my pockets for a few loose bills.

*“Sorry about that, bud. Can’t seem to find the way out of my own head today.”*

Danny smiled, revealing a mouth only half-filled with teeth.

I’d known him for as long as I’d lived in town, give or take two years. Didn’t know much *about* him, though. I wasn’t aware why he was homeless, nor was I clued in as to why he never spoke. Say what you want about Danny, but it’s hard to deny that the man was a curiosity. He didn’t fit nicely into any particular archetype, I suppose. His beard was wild and his dentition was a nightmare, but the odd camo-colored jumpsuits he sported never smelled too bad. He was mute, but he didn’t appear to have any other severe mental health issues. No obvious ones, anyway. He always appeared content even though he lived on the street, begging for change.

A man of inherent contradictions, silently loitering on a bench in front of the cafe, day in and day out. I liked him. There was something hopeful lingering behind his existence. Gave him what I had to spare when I went for coffee most days.

As I dropped the crumpled five-dollar bill into his cup, I saw it passing behind him.

The truck was moving about fifteen miles an hour, but that did not seem to bother them. The leader didn’t struggle to keep his balance as he toiled away, both hands inside his patient. The table and the tools and the crash cart didn’t shift around from the momentum.

It was difficult to determine *exactly* what procedure they were performing. The monitors and their video feeds were pointed towards the operation, yes, but they were so zoomed in that it was nearly impossible to orient myself to what I was seeing: an incomprehensible mess of gleaming viscera, soggy, red, and pulsing.

Best guess? They were rooting around in someone’s abdomen.

Now, I’m a pretty reserved person. My ex-wife described me as *conflict-avoidant* to our marriage counselor. But the raw surprise of seeing that truck and the accompanying gore broke my normal pattern of behavior. Really lit a fire under my ass.

*“Hey! What the hell do you all think you’re doin’? There’s an elementary school a block over, for Christ’s sake!”* I shouted, jogging after the truck.

With its hazard lights flashing, the vehicle started to pull over to the side of the road. I had almost caught up to it when I heard the pounding of fast, heavy footsteps behind me.

Danny slowed his pace, wrapped his arm around my shoulders, and began *speaking*. His voice was low and raspy, like his vocal cords were fighting to make sound through a thick layer of rust. He didn’t really *say* anything, either. Or, more accurately, what he was saying had no meaning.

*“Well..yes..and…you see that…”* - on and on and on.

In retrospect, I realize that wasn’t the point. Danny wasn’t talking to relay a message. No, he was just *pretending* to be embroiled in conversation, and he wanted me to play along. With his arm wrapped around my shoulder, he forcefully pushed my cheek with his fingers, turning my head so my eyes would face him, and not the truck.

I didn’t intend to play along. I was still fuming about the gruesome display, aiming to give the perpetrators a piece of my mind. But the entire sequence of events was so disarmingly strange that my brain just ended up short-circuiting.

So, I played along.

The look of raw dread behind Danny’s eyes convinced me to help maintain the charade of a conversation, even if I didn’t understand why it was so important. I suppressed my anger and walked alongside him until we reached the nearest alleyway. He started turning into it, so I followed suit.

I caught a glimpse of the parked truck as we pivoted.

They were no longer operating. Instead, they were all clustered in a corner, staring intently at us, the leader’s skin-toned smock and gaunt body towering above the rest of the group.

As soon as we were out of view, Danny dropped the act. He doubled over, hyperventilating, hand pushed into the brick of the adjacent building to keep him from falling over completely.

*“What the fuck is going on?”* I whispered.

The man’s breathing began to regulate. My voice grew louder.

*“What the hell kind of surgery are they doing in there?”*

Danny shot up and put a finger to his lips to shush me. I acquiesced. Stayed silent and waited. Once it was clear that I wasn’t going to start yelling at him again, he pulled the five-dollar bill I’d just given him from one pocket and a cheap ballpoint pen from the other. The man rolled the bill against the brick wall and furiously scribbled a message. He then folded it neatly, placed it on his palm, and offered it to me.

Reluctantly, I took the money back.

He muttered the word “*sorry*” and then ran further into the alleyway. I didn’t give chase.

Instead, I uncrumpled the bill and read his message. Danny’s erratic handwriting conveyed a series of fragmented warnings:

*“It looks different for everyone.”*

*“If you react, they can tell you’re uninhabited.”*

*“Once they’re sure, that’s when they take you.”*

*“They chose brown for their larvae - brown is the most common.”*

*“You need to leave town tonight.”*


\- - - - - 

The next afternoon, I discovered Danny’s usual bench concerningly unoccupied.

But the truck was there. Parked right outside the cafe.

New patient, new surgery.

I trusted Danny was on to something, but I didn’t heed his advice and leave town.

Not right away.

It was nearly impossible to *pretend* they weren’t there, especially once they started driving around my neighborhood at night. I could faintly hear the whirring of drills above the grumbling engine, intermittently passing by my bedroom window.

They didn’t just plant themselves right outside my front door, thankfully. They still did their rounds, their “patrol”, but it felt like they’d taken a special interest in me. Maybe I was a unique case to them. They weren’t *completely* confident I could see them. I’m sure it was pretty cut and dry most of the time. Danny’s intervention had put me in a nebulous middle ground. Maybe I did see them that day. Or maybe I was just having a heated conversation with Danny. 

Thus, they increased the pressure.

Either I’d crack, or I wouldn’t.

I came pretty close.

You see, it wasn’t just the sheer absurdity of it all that was getting to me. The stimuli felt targeted. Catered to my very specific set of traumas. I suppose that probably yields the best results.

Which brings me to this:

Have you ever heard of a condition called *Anesthesia Awareness?*

It’s the fancy name for the concept of maintaining consciousness during a surgery, instead of falling asleep. All things considered, it’s a fairly common phenomenon: one for every fifteen thousand operations or so.

For most, it’s only a blip. A fleeting lucidity. A quick flash of awareness, and then they’re back under.

For most, it’s painless. Even without pain, it’s still pretty terrifying. Paralytics are a devilish breed of pharmacology. Complete and utter muscular shutdown without touching the brain’s ability to think and perceive. Immurement within the confines of your own flesh. To me, there isn’t a purer vision of hell.

That said, I’m fairly biased. Because I’m not like most.

I was awake for the entirety of my appendectomy, and I felt every single thing. Sure, they saved my life. I was on death’s door. My appendix detonated like a grenade inside my abdominal cavity.

But I mean, at what cost?

The first incision was the worst. I won’t bother describing the pain. The sensation was immeasurable. Completely off the scale.

And I couldn’t do a goddamn thing about it.

They dug around in my torso for nearly two hours. Exhuming the infected appendix and cleaning up the damage it’d already done. Cauterizing my bleeding intestines. 

I *sort of* accumulated to the pain. I never accumulated to the smell.

About half-way through, I even managed to kick my foot. Just once, and it wasn’t much. It’d taken nuclear levels of energy and willpower to manifest that tiny movement through the effects of the paralytic.

A nurse mentioned the kick to the surgeon. Want to know what he said in response?

*“Noted.”*

\- - - - - 

I’ve been hoping the truck would give up at some point and just move on. It wasn’t a great plan, but I didn’t exactly have the money to skip town and start a life somewhere else.

What transpired this afternoon changed my opinion on the matter.

When I stopped by the coffee shop, the truck was there, per my new normal. I’d considered completely altering my routine to avoid them, but if the safest thing to do was to pretend they weren’t there, wouldn’t that be suspicious?

As I was walking out with my drink, doing my absolute damndest to act casual, I saw who was on the operating table today.

It may not have *actually* been him, of course. It could have just been an escalation on their part. A sharper piece of stimuli in order to finally illicit a reaction from me.

To their credit, witnessing Danny being cut into did make me flinch. I’m not sure how obvious it was.

When I got back to my sedan, I didn’t head to work. I returned home to retrieve a couple of necessities; primarily, family photos and my revolver. Wanted to say goodbye to James as well.

He wasn’t expecting me home so soon.

*They* weren’t expecting me home so soon.

I threw open the front door to our apartment, and there he was: propped up on the couch, motionless, trails of mucus across his cheeks, all the way down to the collar of his shirt.

Eyeless.

No blood anywhere.

I heard them before I saw them.

They emit this deep, gurgling sound when threatened. It’s not loud, but it’s hard to miss.

Then, one came into view. Guess it’d been scaling the back of the couch when I walked in.

Honestly, it resembled an oversized caterpillar: pale, segmented, scrunching its body as it moved - but it was as big as a sausage link. Its tail was distinctive, tapering off like a wasp’s belly until the very end, at which point it abruptly expanded and became spherical with colored markings. 

From behind, it looked like an eyeball with a hazel-colored iris.

Danny called them *larvae*. I suppose that’s a good fit. I’m assuming they can’t communicate with their hive mind until they're fully grown, otherwise, why wouldn’t James have alerted them to my lack of inhabitation?

Initially, I thought it was crawling back *into* James, head first into his eye socket so its tail could snuggly lay where his eye should have been.

It completely passed him by, though. Slithered down from the couch and onto the floor.

The larva was crawling towards me, I think.

I didn’t stick around to find out.

\- - - - - 

Honestly, I’m starting to believe most people are already inhabited.

For those among you who aren’t, I don’t know what the inside of the truck will look like when it gets to you, but it’ll be something that’s designed to get your attention.

Your best bet is to not respond.

Be like me on the operating table.

No matter how terrible it is, no matter how painful it feels, no matter how loud your body screams for you to intervene:

*“What am I even looking at, here…”* I whispered to myself.

The soft clicking of my sedan’s turn signal chirped in my ear, and my fingers tapped against the steering wheel with an impatient rhythm. I turned away and attempted to keep my eyes fixed forward. Despite my best efforts,  though, I found my gaze drifting from the reddish glow of the stoplight to the reddish glow emanating from the truck.

My eyes narrowed as I scanned the enormous glass cargo hold, struggling to imagine what the purpose of such of thing could even be. There was movement inside of it, too. Some internal light fixture illuminated the people walking about the truck bed.

Initially, I couldn’t tell what they were doing.

A red curtain draped against the inside of the glass obscured my view.

Multiple human-shaped shadows flickered behind the curtain, pacing up and down the length of the eighteen-wheeler like a group of anxiety-riddled stagehands preparing for act one of a play on opening night.

Obviously, the thought was absurd. It was 3:53 in the morning. Main Street was appropriately deserted. Just me and the truck; no other vehicles in sight.

Who the hell would they even be performing for?

Icy sweat beaded on my forehead. I cranked the A/C to its highest setting. Some combination of exhaustion from my night shift and the uncanny sight was making my heart palpitate.

Then, they pulled back the curtain.

It was a devastatingly familiar scene. My breath came out in ragged gasps. Hot nausea creeped up the back of throat.

The shining steel table. Honeycombed overhead lights like monstrous bug-eyes. Drills. Scalpels. Monitors with video feeds displaying the table from every conceivable angle. Away from the table, a flock of subordinates, attired in sterile gowns and powdered gloves, remained still.

They waited for their leader’s command.

He was impossibly tall, hunching slightly forward to prevent his head from grazing the top of the hollow container. As if to further delineate his rank, the leader’s smock was leathery and skin toned; everyone else’s was white and cleanly pressed. Between the mask covering his mouth and the glare from the light affixed to his glasses, I couldn’t see his face.

He lumbered toward the table, fingers wrapped around the handles of a wheelchair.

The person in the wheelchair was unconscious. A young man with a mop of frizzy brown hair, naked as the day he was born. His head was dead weight, rolling across his chest he creaked forward, inch by tortuous inch.

Despite his rag-doll body, I knew his awake. Even if I couldn’t see them, I knew there was life in his eyes.

He just couldn’t move his body.

Still, they were going to perform a surgery on the poor sap.

I looked away. The traffic light was still red. I glanced at the clock.

*4:01AM*.

Without a second thought, my boot crashed onto the accelerator. I sped down Main Street. The truck became smaller and smaller in my rear-view mirror until it was just a dot of light on the horizon.

A wave of relief swept down my spine, but an intrusive thought soured my respite.

*They’ve likely started operating, and he can feel everything. The ripping of skin. The oozing of blood. His nerves are screaming.*

*He just can’t say anything.*

\- - - - - 

*“…I’m sorry Pete, run that by me again? What was so wrong with the truck?”* James asked, rubbing his temple like he had a migraine coming on.

I tore off a sheet from a nearby paper towel roll and reached over our kitchen island.

*“You’re dripping again, bud,”* I remarked.

James cocked his head at me, then looked to the wipe. He couldn’t feel the mucus dripping from the corner of his right eye, apparently. It took a few seconds for him to process the statement.

Recognition flashed across his face.

*“Oh! Shoot.”*

He grabbed the paper towel and blotted away the gelatinous teardrop - a side effect from the LASIK procedure that he had underwent a month prior.

Overall, I agreed with him: James looked better without glasses. That said, if attention from the opposite sex was the name of the game, the persistent ocular discharge that he now suffered from seemed like a bit of monkey’s paw. One step forward, two steps back.

He didn’t seem overly preoccupied with the issue.

As he crumpled the paper towel, I tried explaining what’d happened the night before. For the third time.

*“I’m driving home from a shift, idling at a stoplight, and this truck pulls up beside me. One of those big motherfuckers. Cargo hold the size of our apartment, monster-truck wheels - you get the idea. But the cargo hold, it’s this huge glass box. There’s a curtain on the inside, like they were about to debut a mobile rendition of Hamlet. But they - the people inside of the box, I forgot to mention the people - they weren’t about to perform a play. I mean, I don’t know for sure that they weren’t, but that’s besides the point. They looked like they were going to…and I know how this sounds…but they looked like they were going to perform surgery…”*

My recollection of the event crumbled. I was losing the plot. Found myself distracted by James.

Now, both sides were leaking.

I ripped another piece of paper towel off the roll and handed it to him. He was watching me, but his expression was vacant. The lights were on behind his eyes, but nobody seemed to be home. I started to wonder if he’d discontinued his ADHD meds or something.

After an uncomfortable pause, he realized *why* I was giving him more tissue paper.

*“So, what was so wrong with the truck?”* he repeated, once again blotting the tears away.

\- - - - - 

About a week passed before I saw the truck again.

That time, it was all happening in broad daylight.

I rounded a corner onto Main Street and parked my car in front of our local coffee shop, pining for my afternoon bolus of caffeine to prepare for another grueling night shift.

As I placed my hand over the cafe’s doorknob, I heard a familiar jingling noise behind me. The rattling of change against the inside of a plastic cup. A pang of guilt curled around my heart like a hungry python.

I’d walked past Danny like he didn’t even exist.

I flipped around, digging through my pockets for a few loose bills.

*“Sorry about that, bud. Can’t seem to find the way out of my own head today.”*

Danny smiled, revealing a mouth only half-filled with teeth.

I’d known him for as long as I’d lived in town, give or take two years. Didn’t know much *about* him, though. I wasn’t aware why he was homeless, nor was I clued in as to why he never spoke. Say what you want about Danny, but it’s hard to deny that the man was a curiosity. He didn’t fit nicely into any particular archetype, I suppose. His beard was wild and his dentition was a nightmare, but the odd camo-colored jumpsuits he sported never smelled too bad. He was mute, but he didn’t appear to have any other severe mental health issues. No obvious ones, anyway. He always appeared content even though he lived on the street, begging for change.

A man of inherent contradictions, silently loitering on a bench in front of the cafe, day in and day out. I liked him. There was something hopeful lingering behind his existence. Gave him what I had to spare when I went for coffee most days.

As I dropped the crumpled five-dollar bill into his cup, I saw it passing behind him.

The truck was moving about fifteen miles an hour, but that did not seem to bother them. The leader didn’t struggle to keep his balance as he toiled away, both hands inside his patient. The table and the tools and the crash cart didn’t shift around from the momentum.

It was difficult to determine *exactly* what procedure they were performing. The monitors and their video feeds were pointed towards the operation, yes, but they were so zoomed in that it was nearly impossible to orient myself to what I was seeing: an incomprehensible mess of gleaming viscera, soggy, red, and pulsing.

Best guess? They were rooting around in someone’s abdomen.

Now, I’m a pretty reserved person. My ex-wife described me as *conflict-avoidant* to our marriage counselor. But the raw surprise of seeing that truck and the accompanying gore broke my normal pattern of behavior. Really lit a fire under my ass.

*“Hey! What the hell do you all think you’re doin’? There’s an elementary school a block over, for Christ’s sake!”* I shouted, jogging after the truck.

With its hazard lights flashing, the vehicle started to pull over to the side of the road. I had almost caught up to it when I heard the pounding of fast, heavy footsteps behind me.

Danny slowed his pace, wrapped his arm around my shoulders, and began *speaking*. His voice was low and raspy, like his vocal cords were fighting to make sound through a thick layer of rust. He didn’t really *say* anything, either. Or, more accurately, what he was saying had no meaning.

*“Well..yes..and…you see that…”* - on and on and on.

In retrospect, I realize that wasn’t the point. Danny wasn’t talking to relay a message. No, he was just *pretending* to be embroiled in conversation, and he wanted me to play along. With his arm wrapped around my shoulder, he forcefully pushed my cheek with his fingers, turning my head so my eyes would face him, and not the truck.

I didn’t intend to play along. I was still fuming about the gruesome display, aiming to give the perpetrators a piece of my mind. But the entire sequence of events was so disarmingly strange that my brain just ended up short-circuiting.

So, I played along.

The look of raw dread behind Danny’s eyes convinced me to help maintain the charade of a conversation, even if I didn’t understand why it was so important. I suppressed my anger and walked alongside him until we reached the nearest alleyway. He started turning into it, so I followed suit.

I caught a glimpse of the parked truck as we pivoted.

They were no longer operating. Instead, they were all clustered in a corner, staring intently at us, the leader’s skin-toned smock and gaunt body towering above the rest of the group.

As soon as we were out of view, Danny dropped the act. He doubled over, hyperventilating, hand pushed into the brick of the adjacent building to keep him from falling over completely.

*“What the fuck is going on?”* I whispered.

The man’s breathing began to regulate. My voice grew louder.

*“What the hell kind of surgery are they doing in there?”*

Danny shot up and put a finger to his lips to shush me. I acquiesced. Stayed silent and waited. Once it was clear that I wasn’t going to start yelling at him again, he pulled the five-dollar bill I’d just given him from one pocket and a cheap ballpoint pen from the other. The man rolled the bill against the brick wall and furiously scribbled a message. He then folded it neatly, placed it on his palm, and offered it to me.

Reluctantly, I took the money back.

He muttered the word “*sorry*” and then ran further into the alleyway. I didn’t give chase.

Instead, I uncrumpled the bill and read his message. Danny’s erratic handwriting conveyed a series of fragmented warnings:

*“It looks different for everyone.”*

*“If you react, they can tell you’re uninhabited.”*

*“Once they’re sure, that’s when they take you.”*

*“They chose brown for their larvae - brown is the most common.”*

*“You need to leave town tonight.”*


\- - - - - 

The next afternoon, I discovered Danny’s usual bench concerningly unoccupied.

But the truck was there. Parked right outside the cafe.

New patient, new surgery.

I trusted Danny was on to something, but I didn’t heed his advice and leave town.

Not right away.

It was nearly impossible to *pretend* they weren’t there, especially once they started driving around my neighborhood at night. I could faintly hear the whirring of drills above the grumbling engine, intermittently passing by my bedroom window.

They didn’t just plant themselves right outside my front door, thankfully. They still did their rounds, their “patrol”, but it felt like they’d taken a special interest in me. Maybe I was a unique case to them. They weren’t *completely* confident I could see them. I’m sure it was pretty cut and dry most of the time. Danny’s intervention had put me in a nebulous middle ground. Maybe I did see them that day. Or maybe I was just having a heated conversation with Danny. 

Thus, they increased the pressure.

Either I’d crack, or I wouldn’t.

I came pretty close.

You see, it wasn’t just the sheer absurdity of it all that was getting to me. The stimuli felt targeted. Catered to my very specific set of traumas. I suppose that probably yields the best results.

Which brings me to this:

Have you ever heard of a condition called *Anesthesia Awareness?*

It’s the fancy name for the concept of maintaining consciousness during a surgery, instead of falling asleep. All things considered, it’s a fairly common phenomenon: one for every fifteen thousand operations or so.

For most, it’s only a blip. A fleeting lucidity. A quick flash of awareness, and then they’re back under.

For most, it’s painless. Even without pain, it’s still pretty terrifying. Paralytics are a devilish breed of pharmacology. Complete and utter muscular shutdown without touching the brain’s ability to think and perceive. Immurement within the confines of your own flesh. To me, there isn’t a purer vision of hell.

That said, I’m fairly biased. Because I’m not like most.

I was awake for the entirety of my appendectomy, and I felt every single thing. Sure, they saved my life. I was on death’s door. My appendix detonated like a grenade inside my abdominal cavity.

But I mean, at what cost?

The first incision was the worst. I won’t bother describing the pain. The sensation was immeasurable. Completely off the scale.

And I couldn’t do a goddamn thing about it.

They dug around in my torso for nearly two hours. Exhuming the infected appendix and cleaning up the damage it’d already done. Cauterizing my bleeding intestines. 

I *sort of* accumulated to the pain. I never accumulated to the smell.

About half-way through, I even managed to kick my foot. Just once, and it wasn’t much. It’d taken nuclear levels of energy and willpower to manifest that tiny movement through the effects of the paralytic.

A nurse mentioned the kick to the surgeon. Want to know what he said in response?

*“Noted.”*

\- - - - - 

I’ve been hoping the truck would give up at some point and just move on. It wasn’t a great plan, but I didn’t exactly have the money to skip town and start a life somewhere else.

What transpired this afternoon changed my opinion on the matter.

When I stopped by the coffee shop, the truck was there, per my new normal. I’d considered completely altering my routine to avoid them, but if the safest thing to do was to pretend they weren’t there, wouldn’t that be suspicious?

Say what you want about Danny, but it’s hard to deny that the man was a curiosity. He didn’t fit nicely into any particular archetype, I suppose. His beard was wild and his dentition was a nightmare, but the odd camo-colored jumpsuits he sported never smelled too bad. He was mute, but he didn’t appear to have any other severe mental health issues. No obvious ones, anyway. He always appeared content even though he lived on the street, begging for change.

A man of inherent contradictions, silently loitering on a bench in front of the cafe, day in and day out. I liked him. There was something hopeful lingering behind his existence. Gave him what I had to spare when I went for coffee most days.

As I dropped the crumpled five-dollar bill into his cup, I saw it passing behind him.

The truck was moving about fifteen miles an hour, but that did not seem to bother them. The leader didn’t struggle to keep his balance as he toiled away, both hands inside his patient. The table and the tools and the crash cart didn’t shift around from the momentum.

It was difficult to determine *exactly* what procedure they were performing. The monitors and their video feeds were pointed towards the operation, yes, but they were so zoomed in that it was nearly impossible to orient myself to what I was seeing: an incomprehensible mess of gleaming viscera, soggy, red, and pulsing.

Best guess? They were rooting around in someone’s abdomen.

Now, I’m a pretty reserved person. My ex-wife described me as *conflict-avoidant* to our marriage counselor. But the raw surprise of seeing that truck and the accompanying gore broke my normal pattern of behavior. Really lit a fire under my ass.

*“Hey! What the hell do you all think you’re doin’? There’s an elementary school a block over, for Christ’s sake!”* I shouted, jogging after the truck.

With its hazard lights flashing, the vehicle started to pull over to the side of the road. I had almost caught up to it when I heard the pounding of fast, heavy footsteps behind me.

Danny slowed his pace, wrapped his arm around my shoulders, and began *speaking*. His voice was low and raspy, like his vocal cords were fighting to make sound through a thick layer of rust. He didn’t really *say* anything, either. Or, more accurately, what he was saying had no meaning.

*“Well..yes..and…you see that…”* - on and on and on.

In retrospect, I realize that wasn’t the point. Danny wasn’t talking to relay a message. No, he was just *pretending* to be embroiled in conversation, and he wanted me to play along. With his arm wrapped around my shoulder, he forcefully pushed my cheek with his fingers, turning my head so my eyes would face him, and not the truck.

I didn’t intend to play along. I was still fuming about the gruesome display, aiming to give the perpetrators a piece of my mind. But the entire sequence of events was so disarmingly strange that my brain just ended up short-circuiting.

So, I played along.

The look of raw dread behind Danny’s eyes convinced me to help maintain the charade of a conversation, even if I didn’t understand why it was so important. I suppressed my anger and walked alongside him until we reached the nearest alleyway. He started turning into it, so I followed suit.

I caught a glimpse of the parked truck as we pivoted.

They were no longer operating. Instead, they were all clustered in a corner, staring intently at us, the leader’s skin-toned smock and gaunt body towering above the rest of the group.

As soon as we were out of view, Danny dropped the act. He doubled over, hyperventilating, hand pushed into the brick of the adjacent building to keep him from falling over completely.

*“What the fuck is going on?”* I whispered.

The man’s breathing began to regulate. My voice grew louder.

*“What the hell kind of surgery are they doing in there?”*

Danny shot up and put a finger to his lips to shush me. I acquiesced. Stayed silent and waited. Once it was clear that I wasn’t going to start yelling at him again, he pulled the five-dollar bill I’d just given him from one pocket and a cheap ballpoint pen from the other. The man rolled the bill against the brick wall and furiously scribbled a message. He then folded it neatly, placed it on his palm, and offered it to me.

Reluctantly, I took the money back.

He muttered the word “*sorry*” and then ran further into the alleyway. I didn’t give chase.

Instead, I uncrumpled the bill and read his message. Danny’s erratic handwriting conveyed a series of fragmented warnings:

*“It looks different for everyone.”*

*“If you react, they can tell you’re uninhabited.”*

*“Once they’re sure, that’s when they take you.”*

*“They chose brown for their larvae - brown is the most common.”*

*“You need to leave town tonight.”*


\- - - - - 

The next afternoon, I discovered Danny’s usual bench concerningly unoccupied.

But the truck was there. Parked right outside the cafe.

New patient, new surgery.

I trusted Danny was on to something, but I didn’t heed his advice and leave town.

Not right away.

It was nearly impossible to *pretend* they weren’t there, especially once they started driving around my neighborhood at night. I could faintly hear the whirring of drills above the grumbling engine, intermittently passing by my bedroom window.

They didn’t just plant themselves right outside my front door, thankfully. They still did their rounds, their “patrol”, but it felt like they’d taken a special interest in me. Maybe I was a unique case to them. They weren’t *completely* confident I could see them. I’m sure it was pretty cut and dry most of the time. Danny’s intervention had put me in a nebulous middle ground. Maybe I did see them that day. Or maybe I was just having a heated conversation with Danny. 

Thus, they increased the pressure.

Either I’d crack, or I wouldn’t.

I came pretty close.

You see, it wasn’t just the sheer absurdity of it all that was getting to me. The stimuli felt targeted. Catered to my very specific set of traumas. I suppose that probably yields the best results.

Which brings me to this:

Have you ever heard of a condition called *Anesthesia Awareness?*

It’s the fancy name for the concept of maintaining consciousness during a surgery, instead of falling asleep. All things considered, it’s a fairly common phenomenon: one for every fifteen thousand operations or so.

For most, it’s only a blip. A fleeting lucidity. A quick flash of awareness, and then they’re back under.

For most, it’s painless. Even without pain, it’s still pretty terrifying. Paralytics are a devilish breed of pharmacology. Complete and utter muscular shutdown without touching the brain’s ability to think and perceive. Immurement within the confines of your own flesh. To me, there isn’t a purer vision of hell.

That said, I’m fairly biased. Because I’m not like most.

I was awake for the entirety of my appendectomy, and I felt every single thing. Sure, they saved my life. I was on death’s door. My appendix detonated like a grenade inside my abdominal cavity.

But I mean, at what cost?

The first incision was the worst. I won’t bother describing the pain. The sensation was immeasurable. Completely off the scale.

And I couldn’t do a goddamn thing about it.

They dug around in my torso for nearly two hours. Exhuming the infected appendix and cleaning up the damage it’d already done. Cauterizing my bleeding intestines. 

I *sort of* accumulated to the pain. I never accumulated to the smell.

About half-way through, I even managed to kick my foot. Just once, and it wasn’t much. It’d taken nuclear levels of energy and willpower to manifest that tiny movement through the effects of the paralytic.

A nurse mentioned the kick to the surgeon. Want to know what he said in response?

*“Noted.”*

\- - - - - 

I’ve been hoping the truck would give up at some point and just move on. It wasn’t a great plan, but I didn’t exactly have the money to skip town and start a life somewhere else.

What transpired this afternoon changed my opinion on the matter.

When I stopped by the coffee shop, the truck was there, per my new normal. I’d considered completely altering my routine to avoid them, but if the safest thing to do was to pretend they weren’t there, wouldn’t that be suspicious?

As I was walking out with my drink, doing my absolute damndest to act casual, I saw who was on the operating table today.

It may not have *actually* been him, of course. It could have just been an escalation on their part. A sharper piece of stimuli in order to finally illicit a reaction from me.

To their credit, witnessing Danny being cut into did make me flinch. I’m not sure how obvious it was.

When I got back to my sedan, I didn’t head to work. I returned home to retrieve a couple of necessities; primarily, family photos and my revolver. Wanted to say goodbye to James as well.

He wasn’t expecting me home so soon.

*They* weren’t expecting me home so soon.

I threw open the front door to our apartment, and there he was: propped up on the couch, motionless, trails of mucus across his cheeks, all the way down to the collar of his shirt.

Eyeless.

No blood anywhere.

I heard them before I saw them.

They emit this deep, gurgling sound when threatened. It’s not loud, but it’s hard to miss.

Then, one came into view. Guess it’d been scaling the back of the couch when I walked in.

Honestly, it resembled an oversized caterpillar: pale, segmented, scrunching its body as it moved - but it was as big as a sausage link. Its tail was distinctive, tapering off like a wasp’s belly until the very end, at which point it abruptly expanded and became spherical with colored markings. 

From behind, it looked like an eyeball with a hazel-colored iris.

Danny called them *larvae*. I suppose that’s a good fit. I’m assuming they can’t communicate with their hive mind until they're fully grown, otherwise, why wouldn’t James have alerted them to my lack of inhabitation?

Initially, I thought it was crawling back *into* James, head first into his eye socket so its tail could snuggly lay where his eye should have been.

It completely passed him by, though. Slithered down from the couch and onto the floor.

The larva was crawling towards me, I think.

I didn’t stick around to find out.

\- - - - - 

Honestly, I’m starting to believe most people are already inhabited.

For those among you who aren’t, I don’t know what the inside of the truck will look like when it gets to you, but it’ll be something that’s designed to get your attention.

Your best bet is to not respond.

Be like me on the operating table.

No matter how terrible it is, no matter how painful it feels, no matter how loud your body screams for you to intervene:

1lso4am,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1lso4am/very_mad_at_starbucks_now/,Very mad at Starbucks now,"I have been a big fan of Starbucks for the part 10-15 years. It has deeply into my life that most of my breakfast before work or during holidays that is basically my to go place. My spending at Starbucks is at least hundreds, if not thousands every years. So this is what the brand means to me.

Over time, I would say most of the barista are extremely nice and kind to me. Everytime when they made mistake, or even I made mistake, there is never any questions but doing it again until satisfaction. When I trained for marathon running on the street, I can always walk into Starbucks asking for a cup of ice water, I was never rejected even with no purchase with that small ask. This is why despite the quality of their coffee is not really great or food taste only borderline, I am loyal to them still.

As for the corporate itself, my personal opinion has been quite disappointing. The brand name used to be a place to can go out to spend time with friends or coworkers. Even talking about business I have been seeing many successful meeting with VC occurred at Starbucks. But this experience has been striped away even before COVID. More and more stores has changed their store layout specifically discouraged the customers to stay long, crimes happens so much if you dare to bring anything valuable to the store. Recently some minor changes but affect my experiences a lot includes no WiFi after stored is closed, I can’t even find power source in most of their source to power my device. Food is slowly degrading as well. 

One thing happened earlier this year is that they reversed their restroom policy to customer only. At the time I do not really care much, since most of the baristas are nice enough to never enforce the policy. Business as usual, nobody care to stay at Starbucks anymore as they tried very hard to ensure that already. 

But today something happened to me at this probably the only Starbucks store in Saturday night at Grants Pass, Oregon that has really hit my nerves. I walked into the store during a steaming hot summer weekend asking very politely if I can use their restroom. There are zero customers in the store. Instead of just give me a smile and share the code with me, the barista started welcome me with a very weird facial expression, and ask me if I plan to buy something. I felt very confused because nobody has ever asked me this question at Starbucks, so I simply said can I take a look at the menu after I used the restroom? Then this is when that barista started to show me a very very condescending laugh and words “sorry no buying no restroom”. I felt offended, so return her with this question “Buying is not an issue to me, but do you think this attitude will make me want to buy more?” She roll her eyes and gave me that condescending look again and re-iterate “Sorry company policy”. After that she just walk away and refuse to continue any dialogue.

After this encounter, I even have to check my clothing and the Tesla I parked right in front of the store that there is no way She could confuse me with some questionable homeless person. I get online and try to understand what happened with these restroom thing. Didn’t find much but just the “improve customer experience” BS.

I am not sure this is another shitty thing that new controversial CEO trying to pull to maximize the profit, beyond other already pretty bad experience that happened before his tenure, which by the way I am also a shareholder with tens of thousands of my money on SBUX, that has really not return any meaningful rewards comparing to the racing S&P500 and Dow. But this experience is enough to be the last straw to stop my decade long relationship with them. 

It’s not just because of one “bad experience” but what experience do they plan to offer to their customers? Starbucks no longer represents the American life style they were proud of long long time ago. and they keeps taking one thing after another away from their customers. Now all they talked about is money, money, money” Yet they do not make, period. So these days walking into a gas station to grab a cup of cheap coffee and borrow their rest room is a better experience than Starbucks, and I drive a Tesla for Christ sake.

I am really nobody to these “elite” management sitting in their Seattle office (which their CEO doesn’t even reside in that city) But for sure I will get rid of all my memberships and points, prepaid after I used they all, and most importantly I will give up all my SBUX positions in first transaction day next week. I am sure $30-40K shares means nothing to these guys.

1lso39w,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lso39w/hr_7_devils_bride/,[HR] 7 Devils Bride,"South Carolina is full of ghost stories, most of them cheap thrills born of boredom or drunken dares for teenagers. But Seven Devil’s Bridge? That one stuck with me. Not because I believed in restless spirits or midnight curses, but because i was once one of those bored teenagers, and although i didn't see anything, i heard...something, I've regrated hearing ever since. I didn't believe in ghosts. I just enjoyed fear, and in a smalltown there wasn't much to do. So one day a few friends and I went to go see the Seven Devils Bridge.



The night we went to Seven Devil’s Bridge was thick with humidity, nothing new For South Carolina, it was often hot and humid. The air so still it felt like the world was holding its breath. The road leading up to the bridge was barely visible, swallowed by trees that loomed in from both sides, backroads upon backroads. My friends joked and shoved each other, their laughter sharp against the quiet, but I wasn’t laughing. I was listening, the air felt electric, and i felt something....different.



We stood on the bridge, waiting. The legend said that if you crossed at midnight, you wouldn’t make it to the other side. A lot of nonsense, I thought. Still, we were bored, and just wanted to get out of the house, this was supposed to be just another thing to do, to kill time. So I leaned against the rusted railing, staring down at the shallow creek below, waiting for something, anything to happen, to prove me wrong.



That’s when I heard it. A low cry? It was almost melodic, but broken, fragmented. 

Like sound whispering through static. My head snapped toward my friends, but they were still laughing, still shoving, completely unaware.



The sound twisted, shifting between notes, growing more distinct. Now just a hum. A voice? But the words were impossible to understand. My pulse hammered. I tried to shake it off, tried to tell myself it was the wind, the water below, some trick of my tired mind, but it was gone now, The wind blew gently, the slow flow of water in the creak droned, yet i didn’t move. The sound, whatever it was, now gone, but the feeling of being watched remained.



""what was that?"" i wasn't sure if i was asking myself, my friends or the air, my two friends looked at me amused.

""what are you actually getting freaked out?"" Dale asked, a smirk on his face, while James was dicking around on his phone....did i imagine it? 

Trying to shrug the overwhelming feeling of eyes on me i simply suggested we should go get a bit to eat on the way home, and we left, my friends still lulling about, i found myself antsy, slowing my walking to match there pace.

""get ahold of yourself pussy"" i remember telling myself before pushing my thoughts away as we drove away from Seven Devils Bridge





The drive home should have put it out of my mind. Dale and James kept up their usual antics, arguing over where to grab food, complaining about how dead the town was, but I barely heard them, there in body alone. I kept glancing at the rearview mirror, almost waiting to see something lurking behind us. Nothing. Just the empty road stretching into the night.



Then the first time I heard it again, I was alone.



It was the next morning, in my room, just before sunrise. That same sound, quiet as a hum, distant but impossible to ignore. My stomach twisted. I sat up, listening, holding my breath. It sounded closer now. Like it was inside.



I turned toward my closet, setting ajar, hadn't i closed it the night before? i couldn't remember, i couldn't be sure.

No. No way. I got up, slammed it shut. The humming faded slowly.



For a while, i just sat there, unsure of what i heard, then my alarm went off, I jolted up again as if just waking up, ""was that real...was i dreaming? the uncertainty bleeding reality into fiction. 



At school, it was worse. I was spacing out in class, (i was usually sleeping in class but i felt so wired) then i thought i heard it again. Not a cry this time. Words. Garbled, slipping between syllables like a language I knew but couldn't understand. I looked around but no one else reacted. I pressed my palms against my face, squeezing my eyes shut.



""Not real. Not real."" i thought like a mantra i could will into existence.



But when I opened them, my hands...they weren’t my hands.



They looked...wrong. Smaller? Thinner? Not mine. Not human?



I blinked, and they were normal again. A distant voice in my ear let out a sharp laugh before fading into nothing.



what i felt then wasn't just fear. i was frozen in place, the bell rang but i sat there, not moving till i heard the shovel of the next classes feet. i quickly got up, shaking, sweating, and darted out of the room and into the bathroom, after emptying my stomach and leaving the restroom i had one thought, ""Fuck This"".

Within the next 15 minutes i was getting into my friends old white chevy truck and we were peeling outta the parking lot, i remember thinking ""eh at least i showed up today"" to clarify i wasn't a great student.

For the next few days, life settled back into the usual haze of wasted hours and half-hearted decisions. No whispers. No voices. No twisted hallucinations.



I convinced myself it had all been some weird trick of exhaustion, or the mind, maybe both, maybe a leftover fear from that damn bridge. So I let it go. I spent the afternoons gaming with Dale and James, trash talking, losing track of time until the sky outside turned deep blue. I skipped school like usual, slept till noon, smoked just enough to keep reality soft around the edges.



It was easy to pretend nothing had happened. Then, it came back, like a distant hum, it came back.



I was at Dale’s place, leaned back on his busted couch, controller in hand, barely focused on some yet another match we were winning or losing. James was rolling a blunt, moaning about how expensive good weed was getting. just another day. A normal day.



And then—the hum. Low and fractured. The kind of sound you’d hear if someone was standing just behind you, breathing words through gritted teeth, something more primal than anger. I stiffened.



James flicked his lighter, exhaling smoke. Dale cursed at the screen. Neither of them heard it. life parading on around me.



I swallowed hard, eyes darting toward the darkened hallway leading out of the living room we called home. Something was standing there, just a shape. Unmoving. Wrong.



I stared. Blinked. Gone.



I exhaled slowly, forcing a smirk, forcing myself back into the game. This wasn’t real. It wasn’t i told myself.



I took a deep inhale, letting the smoke roll through my lungs, heavier than it should’ve been. Relax. That’s what I needed. That’s what I told myself.



Dale was still talking, something about his ex and how she was “certifiably insane.” James was focused on rolling another blunt, eyes lazily tracking the process like it was second nature. Everything was normal. I was normal. This was normal.



Then—the sound. Subtle. Weaving between the static of the TV in the background. Like a breath beneath the silence.



I froze. focusing on the sound, trying to convince myself it was nothing. Paranoia. Overthinking.



Then, the voice came, low, sharp, slicing through the air like a blade.



""You are not alone.""



I choked on my breath, coughing violently, nearly knocking the coffee table over as i shot up and stumbled.



James frowned at me. Dale paused mid-sentence.



""You good?"" Dale asked, raising an eyebrow. I tried to speak, but my throat was locked up, my heart hammering against my ribs. Not alone? What the hell did that mean?



My head snapped toward the hallway again...nothing. But I swore I felt something standing there, watching. Breathing.



I gripped the edge of the couch, my pulse thundering, the high suffocating me instead of calming me.



James flicked his lighter, eyes narrowing. “You sure your good bro? something up?”



I let out a sharp, nervous laugh. it felt loud and forced.



""Nah, man, shit just hit me harder than I expected,"" I lied, forcing a smirk, wiping sweat from my forehead.



I was not alone. And i silently hoped i was just losing my mind.



The tension had reached a breaking point. I wasn’t hiding it well anymore, i couldn't, the sleepless nights, the paranoia, the way I flinched at sounds no one else seemed to hear. Dale and James had started watching me, their jokes turning into quiet questions, uneasy glances. I could see it in their faces, they knew something was wrong.



Finally, James snapped.



“Look, man, what the hell is up with you?” he asked, blunt tucked behind his ear, arms crossed. “You’ve been losing your mind ever since we went to the bridge.”



Dale nodded, leaning against his truck. “Yeah. You ain’t exactly subtle.”



I opened my mouth to lie, to brush it off, but I couldn’t. swallowing the lump in my throat i simply asked



“You think it started there?” voice hollow.



James and Dale exchanged a glance.



“I Guess...That’s the only thing that makes sense,” Dale said. “You were normal before.”



That word normal, hearing it in the context hurt.



James exhaled sharply. “Then maybe we gotta go back.”



My pulse spiked. “What?”



He shrugged. “Think about it. Maybe it’s like… I don’t know. maybe going back will help you chill out.”



Dale shrugged. “fuck it why not?”



I wanted to argue, I really did. But the voice—the one that had been whispering in my ear for days—had said something, hadn’t it?



""Come back."" ""Fix it.""



Against every ounce of logic in my body, in cold sweat I agreed.



Seven Devil’s Bridge looked different this night.



We stood at the edge, headlights casting long shadows over the cracked pavement, the quiet suffocating from all sides.



Dale was tense. James was still trying to act casual. But I? I felt sick.



“I don’t get it,” Dale muttered. “What are we even supposed to do?”



James shrugged. “See if something happens.”



I exhaled slowly, stepping forward. The air felt wrong, like the pressure had shifted. My hands shook, but I shoved them into my hoodie pockets. I had to do this.



Then, the humming began. Not distant this time. Not faint. Loud. Surrounding us. Wrapping around us like a silent beast.



Dale cursed, stepping back. James stiffened. They heard it...they HEARD IT!



Then we saw them. Seven figures. Hanging from the bridge.



Still. Twisting. Watching. crying.



Dale moved first.



A strangled sound escaped him, something between a scream and a curse, but he didn't stop to process what he was seeing. He ran.



James followed, stumbling backward, dragging me with him. His grip was tight, nails digging into my wrist, pulling me toward the truck like he was afraid the ground might swallow us.



Yet I hesitated. Not because I wanted to stay, but because the figures had turned their heads toward us.



Seven sets of hollow, bloodshot eyes, locked onto mine. Their swollen maggot filled mouths twisted, open but not speaking, tongues blackened and shriveled from the noose around their throats. But I heard them anyway.



""Come back."" ""left us."" ""Fix it.""



Then one of them moved.

e rope, a wet, tearing  gurgling sound filling the air.



Everything became a blur, before i knew what i had done I ran.



The truck door slammed behind me, Dale fumbling with the keys, James breathing hard beside me. The engine roared to life, the tires kicking gravel as we sped away, the bridge shrinking in the distance.



But the voices never faded, becoming a constant hum.



By the time we reached town, Dale’s hands were shaking too much to hold his phone, and James had gone silent—just staring at the road ahead, eyes wide, unblinking.



I sat in the back, gripping my knees, pulse hammering. Because even though we had left...I could still see them.



Now, they weren’t just at the bridge. They were everywhere.

A violent jerk, body convulsing against the rope.



The bridge never let us go. after that second visit, after we saw those...things, everything got worse. The air around us felt heavier, like we were dragging something unseen everywhere we went.



At first, I thought it was just me. The noises hadn’t stopped. It followed me home, curling beneath the sound of my breathing, hiding under the flicker of my bedroom light.



Then James called.



“I saw it again,” he whispered. “The bridge. But I wasn’t there. I was in my room, but when I blinked I-I was hanging from it.” Then Dale was next.



He slammed his palms against the hood of his truck one afternoon, shaking his head like he was trying to wake up. “I keep seeing them..Everywhere. In the mirror. Outside my window. In the backseat when I drive. They don’t move...but they’re watching.”



And me? I was drowning in it. The hallucinations weren’t just flickers anymore. They were vivid. Brutal.



I couldn’t tell if I was awake or dreaming, because every time I blinked, I saw them die, at times, seeing US die.



The first man—he kicked. Struggled. His fingers clawed at the rope around his neck, body convulsing as blood pooled behind his eyes.



The second. Silent. Motionless. Accepting the fate she'd been given.



The third screamed, a raw, splintering sound that tore through my skull, his mouth twisted open as if the air had been ripped from his lungs.



And the rest, they watched me.



Even as they hung—the stares burned into me. 



I gripped my desk, panting, choking on air, the classroom around me collapsing into static. Dale and James were looking at me.



They knew. Because now, they had seen it too.



The days after the second visit blurred into something fractured. None of us could hold onto reality the way we used to.



Yet I wasn’t alone anymore. Now, Dale and James heard them too.



The voices had spread like an infection, crawling into our lives, twisting in ways none of us could ignore. And the hallucinations were worse.



after me, James saw them after.



It was late, maybe two in the morning, when he called. His voice was hoarse, barely above a whisper.



“They’re here.”



I sat up, gripping my phone. “Where?”



“My room.” His breath hitched. “Hanging. From the ceiling.”



A hollow silence stretched between us. I tried to think, maybe he was just seeing it, just reliving the moment, but then, his voice cracked.



“They’re moving this time.”



I couldn’t respond. Because I knew James was right.



It wasn’t just frozen images anymore. They were changing. Shifting. Growing closer, i had seen them as well.



Then Dale had his turn.



I met up with him a few days later, standing outside his truck, the air thick with weed smoke and something wrong.



“I can’t look in my mirrors anymore,” he muttered, staring past me, eyes red-rimmed and dry. “Every time I do, I see one of them behind me.”



I swallowed hard. He dragged a hand through his hair. “I think it’s getting worse.”



And I knew he was right. Because now, they weren’t just hanging from the bridge.



They were hanging from us. 



The unraveling was slow, but inevitable, I should’ve seen it coming.



One day sitting in Dale’s truck, parked behind the abandoned gas station on the edge of town. a regular hang out spot for us, James was jittery, legs bouncing, knuckles tight around a half-smoked cigarette. Dale was eerily still, staring ahead, barely blinking.



The silence between us felt wrong, uncomfortable, heavy, suffocating, buzzing with something we couldn’t name.



Then Dale twitched. A sharp inhale. Fingers curling into fists. His jaw locked.



“Dale?” I frowned, shifting toward him. “You good?”



He didn’t answer. Instead, his head snapped toward James, eyes wide, wild, like he didn’t recognize him.



And then, he lunged.



James barely had time to react before Dale’s hands were around his throat, knocking him back against the passenger door.



“Dude!” I shouted, scrambling to pull him off.



James choked, gasping, nails digging into Dale’s arms, struggling to push him away, but Dale’s grip tightened.



His eyes weren’t normal, they were bloodshot, blown wide, like something else was looking through them.



And then he spoke. though it wasn’t his voice.



""You crossed the bridge."" ""You left us there."" ""Why did you leave?""



My stomach dropped.



I grabbed Dale, yanking him back with everything I had, forcing him against the seat, pinning his wrists.



James coughed violently, sucking in air, shaking all over.



Dale blinked fast—something snapped back into place. His face crumpled, realization hitting like a freight train.



“Oh my God,” he whispered. His whole body trembled, eyes darting between me and James. “I—I didn’t mean to—I don’t know what—”



James was still catching his breath, rubbing his throat. His expression wasn’t angry. It was terrified.



Dale’s hands trembled as he reached for James, stopping short. both were terrified.



“I don’t know what happened,” he breathed. “I swear to God, I wasn’t—I don’t even remember—”



None of us knew what to say. Because deep down, we knew the truth. It wasn’t Dale.



Not really.



The next week passed in a haze of frantic research and uneasy silence.



None of us wanted to talk about what happened in the truck. Dale afraid to ask for forgiveness, and would James even accept it? We moved carefully around each other, conversations clipped, tensions hanging in the air like fog.



But the whispers never stopped.



James buried himself in old news articles, digging through anything that mentioned Seven Devil’s Bridge. He found scraps, bits of folklore, missing persons reports, vague warnings dating back decades.



Dale spent nights glued to his laptop, scrolling through conspiracy forums, desperate for anything that felt familiar. And me? I was lost, just listened.



Slowly the voices were changing.



""You don’t belong."" ""you never left. ""Fix it.""



The more we searched, the worse it got as time passed, Reality slipped.



And then James woke up wrong.



I got a call at dawn, his voice shaking, not normal, not James.



“I—I don’t—” His breath came sharp, clipped, uneven. “There’s blood in my bed.”



I sat up fast, heart hammering, the fog of sleep washing away quickly. “What?”



“I-I...don’t know where it came from.” His voice cracked. “I....don’t know if it’s mine.”



Something cold settled in my stomach. ""Did he-no....no""



Dale and I rushed over.



James was waiting for us on his porch, skin pale, pupils blown wide like he hadn’t slept. He led us into his home, slowly, reluctant.

It dawned on me that he hadn't been inside since our call.



The sheets, soaked. Rust-colored, thick, too much blood for one person.



But James had no wounds, Nothing at all, Nothing on him. And the worst part?



When Dale pulled back the blankets, there were handprints.



Seven of them. Smudged into the fabric, fingers long, warped.



close but not human, i swear i saw claw marks, but couldn't be sure.



James sat on the floor, shaking, staring at his hands like they weren’t his. “I don’t—I don’t remember falling asleep.”



Dale swallowed hard. “maybe you didn’t?”



None of us had an answer, because now, it wasn’t just hallucinations anymore.



It was real, and we couldn't differentiate reality from fiction anymore, reality and ""fiction"" were melding together. 



Desperation led us back.



After a week of finding nothing, no explanations, no answers, just more paranoia, we had no choice.



We didn’t talk much on the drive. Dale gripped the wheel, white knuckled, pale faced. James sat rigid, hands tucked under his arms as if he was trying to keep them from shaking.



And me? I listened, lost in a haze of fear and confusion.



The humming had changed. It wasn’t just a whisper, slowly, it became like music. With Notes bent, broken, twisting through the air like a sound that had never been meant for human ears, yet still alluring.



By the time we arrived, the moon sat heavy in the sky, casting long, jagged shadows across the cracked pavement. The bridge loomed ahead, every shadow dancing in my mind.



None of us moved at first. Like we were waiting—for permission.



Then James let out a breath. “We go together.” Dale nodded stiffly.



I swallowed hard. “Yeah.”



And we stepped forward. Back into whatever this was we had stubbled into, whatever had never really let us go.

It felt as though the bridge let us in before we had the chance to change our minds.



The moment our feet hit the wood, the air shifted—thicker, heavier, like space was compressing around us. Everything sounded wrong, felt...wrong.



James sucked in a breath. “Do you feel that?”



None of us answered. We all felt it. Then, reality bled away.



Dale was the first to break.



His eyes widened, breath coming in short bursts as he reached for the side of his head. “No,” he whispered. “They’re inside—I can feel them, I can hear them!”



I turned toward him, stepping closer, but he screamed.



Not just a yell, a raw, primal shriek of terror.



“Get away!” He stumbled back, eyes locked onto something that wasn’t there. His hands twitched like he was trying to claw something out of his own skin.



James grabbed him, voice sharp. “Dale, it’s not real!”



But Dale wasn’t listening. Then James froze.



His face slackened, breath hitching as his gaze lifted toward the bridge, as if he saw something standing there, watching us.



His lips trembled. ""They're moving.""



And then was my turn.



The world fractured around me. The air bled. The bridge split open, spilling its rotted history out into the night.



And something crawled toward me. Not human. Not alive. A writhing puddle of limbs bent the wrong way, its mouth a gaping pit of blackened teeth, flies and maggots flowing out.



It lunged. I didn’t think, I couldn't, I just swung.



The force of the hit sent it sprawling. I didn’t stop, Terror, rage and delirium fueling me.



My fists landed, again, and again, crushing, tearing, breaking. It twitched beneath me, convulsed, cracked, final-



And then I blinked. The hallucination melted away.



And James lay beneath me.



Breathing ragged. Bleeding, Then he wasn't breathing at all. His body lay twisted, throat slack, eyes wide, yet unseeing.



Blood pooled beneath his cracked skull, soaking into the rotting wood. His chest didn’t rise, didn't fall, Didn’t move.



James was dead and it was my fault.



Dale was on his knees now, hands tangled in his hair, rocking slightly, whispering something, but his words I couldn’t be heard over the humming.



The bridge had taken James and we were still standing on it.



Dale moved before I could say anything.



One second, he was kneeling beside James’s body, face pale, hands shaking. The next, he was running.



Away from the bridge. Away from me.



“No—Dale, wait!” I scrambled to my feet, my pulse roaring in my ears. My hands were still wet with blood...James’s blood.



Dale didn't stop.



His breath came ragged, sharp, cutting through the silence like a blade as he ran toward the road. Toward the way out.



I didn't know what else to do, so i chased after him.



I could hear my own voice, raw, desperate. “Dale, listen to me—please! I didn’t mean to! I didn’t—”



He wasn’t listening. Then he slowed.



His footsteps faltered, his pace uneven, then he stopped completely.



I nearly crashed into him, gasping, grabbing his arm. “Dale, we have to—”



Then I saw it. The bridge was still in front of us.



Even though we had been running the opposite way, even though we should’ve left it [behind.it](http://behind.it) was still there.



Like we hadn’t moved at all.



Dale staggered back, shaking his head, his breath quick and shallow. “No—no, this isn’t right. This isn’t—”



My stomach turned as i whipped around, looking back the way we’d come—but it was the same.



Wooden planks stretching endlessly in both directions. No exit. No road.

 

Just the bridge and all around us, the humming grew louder.



Dale snapped.



The weight of everything, the hallucinations, the never ending bridge, James’s death, everything crashed into him at once.



He whirled around, his face twisted with rage and grief, his breath sharp, uneven.



“You killed him!” His voice was raw, cracking like something inside him had finally broken. “You—James is dead because of you!”



My heart dropped, a truth i refused to accept.



“I—I thought I was fighting....something” My words came out frantic, desperate, but Dale wasn’t listening.



""You always thought you were fighting something!"" Dale's hands shook, his body tense with something more than fear. Hate. Betrayal. Terror. ""Maybe it's YOU that’s the problem! maybe this place wanted you, not us!""



I flinched. the words i had thought hurt so much more to hear aloud.



Dale was breathing fast now, eyes darting wildly, his voice tearing through the air like a knife.



“You think I can ever forget what I just saw?"" he hissed. ""You think I can just live with this?!”



I moved toward him, hands raised, pleading. ""Dale, please—we have to get out of here, we have to—”



He shook his head violently, staggering backward, eyes glassy and frantic. ""There’s no way out!""



And then. we saw it. From the shadows of the bridge, something stirred.



A shape. A rotting, twisting thing, its limbs bent at unnatural angles, its flesh torn and leaking, bones jutting through in jagged, uneven splinters.



Its head tilted, too far, its mouth wrong. Breathing, Watching. Waiting.



But the humming, the damn endless, suffocating hum...was gone...



In its place, James’s voice.



""Come closer."" ""Don't left me."" ""You can’t leave too.""



A whisper. Soft, almost pleading, curling through the air around us, threading into our bones.



Dale froze, I couldn’t breathe, James was dead. we knew that. We saw it. i DID it.



But his voice didn’t care because now, it wanted us too.



Then the voices came all at once, an explosion of whispers, a chorus of the dead, words tangled and overlapping, crawling into our ears like rot.



""Dont leave us."" ""You belong here."" ""Come closer."" ""Make it right.""



Dale screamed.



He clutched his head, stumbling back, his breath ragged and sharp, his mind fracturing beneath the weight of voices that weren’t his.



“Shut up!” he gasped. “Shut up!”



But they wouldn't stop.



I tried to reach for him, tried to pull him back, but something had already tswisted or snapped within him.



His movements turned jerky, erratic. His pupils blown wide, unfocused, lost.



And then, the glint of metal, A pocket knife.



Dale lunged.



I barely moved in time, the blade sliced the air, narrowly missing my throat.



""Dale!"" My voice cracked, frantic. ""Stop! It's me!""



But was it Dale anymore? i couldn't be sure.



His breathing hitched, hands trembling, eyes wild and not his own.



""Fix it.""



""You crossed the bridge.""



""Don't leave us.""



The voices pushed him forward.



I grabbed at his wrist, forcing it away, but he seemed stronger now. Or maybe something else was inside him.



The struggle blurred, violent, desperate.



Blood. My own? His? Both?



The knife twisted, slipped from his grip, clattered onto the wood.



Dale staggered back, chest heaving, eyes flickering between recognition and something else.



I didn’t move.



Because now, the bridge was waiting.



Blood pooled at our feet.



I didn’t know whose at first. mine? his? both? but I felt it, warm against my skin, soaking into the decayed wood beneath us.



Dale staggered back, his breath coming in jagged gasps, eyes flickering between horror and realization.



I clutched my side, fingers pressing against the sharp tear in my shirt, the sting beneath it. I’d been cut, fairly deep.



But Dale, Dale was worse.



A gash ran along his arm, deep, trembling, red spilling between his fingers as he tried to press against it.



We stared at each other, shaken, ruined, Then Dale’s face collapsed.



His breath came faster, sharp and uneven, like everything inside him was unraveling all at once.



“I—I did that,” he stammered, voice broken. He shook his head violently, like he could erase what had just happened. “I hurt you. I hurt—”



His gaze flickered toward James’s body. The blood. The twisted, motionless shape.



“No.” Dale’s voice cracked. His hands trembled. “I didn’t—this wasn’t supposed to—”



I stepped forward, ignoring the sting in my side. “Dale, listen to me, we have to figure this—”



“How am I supposed to figure this out?!” His voice rose, tight, unhinged. “James is dead! I tried to kill you! I don’t—”



He cut himself off, his chest heaving, his hands gripping his own hair. His breath hitched.



And then, I saw the moment he decided.



The shift in his posture. The way his body stilled, false calmness in the moment.



“I can’t do this anymore.”



""Dale—""



His hands moved too fast, the knife flashed—



And then his throat was open.



The sound that escaped his lips was small, broken, not meant for the world to hear.



I lurched forward, catching him as his body buckled, dragging him onto my lap, pressing my hands against the wound—but it didn’t matter.



There was too much blood.



""Dale—Dale!"" My voice cracked, shook, choked on something that felt like glass in my throat.



His mouth moved, but the words didn’t come. His fingers twitched against mine, then went still.



The bridge watched.



The voices whispered.



And Dale, he was gone.

I felt the bridge breathe.



I was alone now, or maybe I never had been. Maybe I had always belonged here, just waiting for my turn.



James lay twisted where I left him.



Dale’s body was slack, broken, the knife still loosely in his fingers, his blood pooling in sick rivulets.



And me? I had nowhere left to run.



The moment Dale’s body went still, everything erupted. The whispers turned to screams.



James’s voice. Dale’s voice. A chorus of them. Layered, overlapping, raw, hateful. 



""You did this.""



""You killed me.""



""we’re still here.""



""You belong here.""



I clutched my head, pressing my palms against my temples, trying to drown them out, but no, it was inside me now.



They were inside me. Then the hallucinations ripped open.



James stood in front of me, neck twisted, his lips curled into something between a grin and a snarl.



His throat moved, but I saw the gash, the ruined flesh, the blood still dripping and spurting.



""I woke up in blood.""



Dale trembled beside him, his hands wrapped around his own throat, gasping like he was still trying to breathe.



""You did this.""



I stumbled away. no, no, no, they were dead, they were dead, they were dead!



And then, the bridge changed.



The planks beneath me twisted, rotted, pulsed. The air shifted, thick with something I could feel crawling into my lungs.



Everything bent, distorted, splintered apart until there was only darkness.



And the sound of laughter.



Not mine. Not Dale’s. Not James’s.



Something else. Something that had been waiting all along.



The bridge had taken everything.



James. Dale. Reality itself. I had nothing left, except the truth it was forcing me to see.



The voices didn’t stop. They slithered around me, wrapping into my thoughts, twisting into something that felt more real than my own skin.



""You never left.""



""You belong here.""



""This is where you stay.""



But then...blackness.



Everything tore away, I woke up somewhere else.



Cold metal beneath me. Bright lights overhead.



For a moment, I thought I was dead. that the bridge had finally finished what it started.



God no! the voices...wait



Real voices? Not whispers.



“…Found him wandering. Covered in blood-most of it wasn’t his.”



“…Two confirmed deaths. Dale and James. Killed on the bridge. But the way we found them—”



“…Rambling. Hallucinating. Won’t stop talking about the bridge.”



I realized a pressure around my wrists. Restrained. I twisted, blinking fast. White walls. Clinical air.



Not the bridge, but I was still trapped.



Weeks passed. Month perhaps? I didn't know because none of it was mine anymore.



The cops labeled it murder. The psychiatric evaluations labeled it delusion.



They didn’t believe me. Hell, They couldn’t believe me.



And now, I sit in a windowless room, retelling my story one last time.



My voice hollow, Distant, and at the end, when I had nothing left to say. I exhaled slowly.



Then, I reached for the only thing I had left.



A sharpened edge. One last choice. Before the bridge could take me back.



Am I crazy? Or was the bridge real? either way i still hear the distant, alluring hum, inviting me home.",1,1751761027.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Any prices are in USD. I’m a 31 year old outdoorsy fat queer from California who walks a lot and hikes a moderate amount. Not in amazing shape, did weekly stair workouts for a few months leading up to the trip, except for the last couple weeks due to plantar fasciitis issues. I didn’t do any huge hikes. I’m female and have short hair/look masculine - there were times I felt self-conscious in the women’s restrooms/changing rooms because at first glance I can be mistaken for a cis guy. Not sure if I actually was receiving concerned looks or just self-conscious. Overall I felt fine being fat and visibly queer there. Lots of stores and houses with trans/rainbow flags. Lots of queer people (locals and tourists)

I had no daily set itinerary and 3 bucket list items: 1. Fjaðrárgljúfur, 2. Puffins in Borgarfjodur Eystri 3. Westman Islands. I researched the sub for months, so I had a good idea of typical Ring Road itineraries and several campsites in mind. At night I roughly planned my itinerary for the next day. 

Would I go back? 1000%. If I went back, I’d go straight to the East Fjords and spend a week there. I’d hike near Seydisfjodur. Then I’d spend a few more days on the Snaefellsnes Peninsula. 

Campervan: Cozy Campers Cozy 1 automatic. I booked online several months in advance during one of their 40% off promotions (New Years). They seem to have the 40% off promotions pretty regularly for various holidays. The 40% off paired with the panoramic window design were the primary factors in my decision. I didn’t see any other campers with panoramic windows and I wanted to have a view if I ended up inside on rainy days.  I had a great experience with Cozy Campers, no issues at all. Van was in great condition. Bed was really comfortable. I didn’t cook at all but they provide everything you need to cook. Most campsites I stayed at had kitchens as well. I either ate out or had no-cook meals in the van (skyr and granola, sandwiches, leftovers). I like coffee and bought that daily, rented the coffee press through Cozy but didn’t end up using it. 

- Camper (with transfers to/from airport, add-ons): $1900
- Gas: $400
- Campsites: $110 
- Vestmanneyjar ferry: $120 



Day 0 - May 24th, 2025 
Reykjavik

- Flight arrival 9:30am at KEF. Taxi transfer to Cozy Campers. 
- 12pm reservation at Sky Lagoon (around the corner from Cozy Campers). Killed some time in their cafe before the reservation, delicious coffee and ham & cheese toastie. The entrance into the lagoon from the changing rooms is absolutely magical. Great facilities. The ritual was cool. It was a bit crowded for my liking, but I got a solid 15 mins of quiet reflection looking out over the ocean from the infinity pool to soak everything in and get excited for my trip. 
- Drive to city center, parked at Hallgrimskirkja Church (it was fine overnight - no ticket).
- Walked to City Hub hostel and check-in. Rested a bit. Tried to explore the city a bit but was too tired.
- Dinner at Pizza Port - super fresh cust. I recommend it. Fair warning that the “cheesy” breadsticks don’t actually have cheese haha. Some kind of cheesy seasoning. Delicious though. 
- Crashed around 7pm. I decided to stay at CityHub my first night so I could have a real bed and experience their “hubs.” It was extremely cool and I highly recommend it. Comfy beds, soundproof hubs, clean bathrooms.


Day 1 - May 25th, 2025 
Reykjavik – Olafsvik 

- 7am wake up 
- Walk to Braud & Co for cinnamon rolls
- Ate on a bench along the water not far from Harpa - the view was incredible
- Walked around the city for a couple hours. I loved the vibe and architecture.
- Went to the top of Hallgrimskirkja
- 11am check out of CityHub
- 11:30ish headed west towards Snaefellsnes Peninsula 
Checked out Bjarteyjarsandur Farm campsite, loved it but wanted to keep driving. 
- Sandwich and coffee at Geirabakkari Kaffihus in Borgarnes (delish) 
- Stop at Ytri Tunga Beach, saw a couple seals and the scenery in surrounding areas is absolutely stunning 
- Brief stop at Arnarstapi Cliffs - really pretty, i’m used to gorgeous rocky beaches being from Northern CA so it wasn’t mindblowing, but the surrounding area and mountains were epic.
- Matarlist for dinner in Olafsvik (so good, so unique, my meal was about $40, worth it)
- Camp at Olafsvik campground, great facilities, gorgeous scenery


Day 2 - May 26th, 2025 
Olafsvik to Husavik 

- 8am stop at Kirkjufell, rainy and cold so I didn’t stay long. It looks just like the pictures. 
- Valeria specialty coffee in Grundarfjodur - great coffee and vibe 
- Stop in Hvammstangi for seal colony, it was closed for bird nesting 
- Lunch at Sjavarborg - delicious burger 
- Stop in Blonduos - Hunabud Coffee house and walk along water right near cool Frisbee Golf course 
- Stop in Akureyi at Kronan - delicious fried chicken for dinner 
- Decided to book whale watching in Husavik for the next day
- Stay at Husavik 66.12 North campsite 


Day 3 - May 27th, 2025 
Husavik to Egilsstadir and Borgarfjörður Eystri 

- 9am - ham and cheese croissant from Lokal Bistro, right across the street from the whale watching meeting point. 
- 9:30am whale watching - 2 hour RIB speedboat puffin island and whale safari - $150 - we didn’t find any whales, big bummer. Beautiful boat ride though. And seeing thousands of puffins flying around the island and floating was so cool.
- Quick stop at Lake Myvatn overlook point, midges were very annoying so I left quickly 
- There were some lulls in dramatic green scenery on the drive, just a fair warning. Don’t worry, it returns. 
- Stop at Rjukanafoss, right off the ring road. 10 min uphill hike to the top, worth it! Gorgeous hills
- Around this time a rainbow appeared, tucked away in the mountains, I was in total awe 
- Arrived in Egilsstadir - holy moly. This place and the entire northeastern region was a highlight of the trip for me. It was sunny and gorgeous and the views of the lake/surrounding areas are just stunning 
- Stop at Reindeer Park (epic) 
- Last minute decided to do Vok baths because my body was feeling really tired and all the driving was getting to me. Really cool baths right on the lake. You can jump into the lake and get right back into the warm baths. Invigorating. 
- Netto for groceries - got Skyr, lunch meat, bread
- Drive to Borgarfjodur Eystri - just absolutely mind blowing. The lupines lining the highway and mountains in the distance were incredible. There was super thick fog while crossing over the mountains so I didn’t get to see all the scenery. But when you get past the fog it’s beautiful. 
- Stay at Borgarfjodur Eystri campsite - loved this campsite! Gorgeous scenery, nice facilities.


Day 4 - May 28th, 2025 
Borgarfjodur Eystri to Skaftafell 

- 8am puffins at Harnarhólmi - sooooo cool. you can see puffins right off of the trail. they’ll pop out of their nests and look around and stuff. unbelievably cute. i saw one come out of the nest, turn around, poop, and then immediately go back in. it was hilarious. there for probably 30 mins, it got progressively busier. 
- headed back to Egilsstadir 
- breakfast & coffee at Bókakaffi Hlodum - local vibe, delicious americano 
- Started drive to Hofn (my maps took me on Oxi road - i’d recommend a different route) 
- Drive was stunning but foggy. 
- Lunch Hofn - Kaffi Hornid - great burger. A cat hangs around there and jumped into my van to hang for a bit 🙂
- Drive to Jokulslaron - holy shit. Incredible views. Stopped so many times for pics. 
- 7pm Jokulslaron - absolutely don’t skip. It was packed but worth it. Never seen anything like it.
- Drive to Skaftafell Campground (inside Vatnajokull National Park). Huge campground, nice facilities, gorgeous views. It was nice but I preferred the smaller campgrounds I went to. 


Day 5 - May 29th, 2025
Skaftafell to Westman Islands 

- 8am headed toward Fjaðrárgljúfur. Not many food options along this route - had some yogurt at the campsite and then stopped at Fosshotel and asked if i could buy some coffee from their breakfast buffet. 
- Fjaðrárgljúfur was a highlight for me. I had it as my phone background for months in anticipation for the trip, and now I have a photo I took as my background. Otherworldly and stunningly beautiful. The hike to the top is straight uphill and was challenging for me because of tight shins/plantar fasciitis. I had done stair workouts to prep for uphill stuff and it really paid off on this hike ~cardiovascularly~. If you are less active, expect this to be challenging but SO worth it. I was here for about an hour.
- Skool Beans in Vik (amazing) 
- Vik Kronan and Icewear for souvenirs
- **at this point, I decided to book my ferry to Vestmanneyjar and plan the rest of my stops around that. I was kind of rushed but didn’t mind making shorter stops at the more packed places.
- Reynisfjara Beach - basalt columns are epic
- Skogafoss - epic and worth the stop/crowds 
- Drive to Landeyjahofn for Ferry 
- Ferry ride was beautiful. The arrival at Vestmanneyjar seeing all of the islands up close was breathtaking and definitely worth the trip. 
- Drove around the island aimlessly. Stunning views. I was blessed with sunny weather this whole day.
- GOTT Restaurant for dinner - highly recommend 
- Stay overnight at Vestmanneyjar Campsite - one of my favorites. I couldn’t believe the scenery. Super nice host. 


Day 6 - May 30th, 2025 
Westman Islands to near Borgarnes 

-Vigtin Bakhus for breakfast and coffee - great pastries
- Drove around island aimlessly to kill time before ferry 
12pm ferry 
- Arrived in Landeyjahofn ~1pm
- Drove to Fridheimar - delish, i didn’t have reservations but they fit me in.
- Stopped in Reykjavik, desperately needed to do laundry. Walked around while waiting for laundry at Wash Laundromat. I recommend it, detergent is automatically added during the wash so don’t worry about buying it. 
- Cafe Babalu for coffee and pastry 
- I was blessed with sunny weather all day 
- Drive to Bjarteyjarsandur campsite - i had seen this campsite the first day and decided to come back. So glad I did. Good facilities, quiet, gorgeous views. 
- The drive from Reykjavik to Borgarnes area is stunning so I was happy to backtrack before coming back to Reykjavik and KEF the next day. 


Day 7 - May 31st, 2025 
Borgarnes to KEF, departure 

- Packed in the morning, left campsite around 10am 
- Stop in Reykjavik one more time for Braud and Co. Ate outside of Hallgrimskirkja while processing sadness that I was leaving. 
- Stop for gas
- Check out at Cozy Campers 
- Private taxi transfer to KEF for 5pm flight. 


TIPS/RANDOM TAKEAWAYS:

- Don’t forget face sunscreen 
- I was glad I packed a lot of my typical snacks from home to tide me over/supplement meals 
- I wore lightweight or midweight long sleeve baselayers every day. Toward Vik it got warmer, but I generally needed my baselayer, sweatshirt, and rain jacket (Patagonia Torrentshell). 
- I’m glad I took some cash out as a souvenir, but I didn’t need it at all
- I was thinking “90-70-50-70-90” could be a cool tattoo to commemorate the Ring Road 
- I was out and on the road pretty much 12 hours a day. I love driving long distances and even so, my eyes got tired and I wished at times I had a second driver. I would totally do it again solo though.
- If you reach a point of “i just can’t drive any more,” take a little break. Walk around, get a coffee, sit in the grass somewhere. 
- If you are coming up on a village/stopping point and you kinda need to use the bathroom, just stop. The next stop could be a while. 
- Next time I might plan to visit south coast sites at late night hours to avoid crowds 
- Helpful app: Flush (shows nearby public bathrooms)
- Happy to answer questions!

- I am so grateful for every Icelander I met, every employee working in the tourism industry, every campsite operator and business owner. You were so welcoming and helpful. Iceland is a special place. Huge thank you to everyone who contributes to this 
sub as well. Not sure how I would have planned my trip without it!

1lsnydv,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1lsnydv/two_years_of_complete_misfortune_and_traumas_of/,"Two years of complete misfortune and traumas, of every kind. I keep on fighting but it's not enough, I can't break down or stop either.","First-time poster. Let's just put this premise: when I saw my therapist she said it was too much even for her and to break it down in several sessions. And that was more than a year ago.

About me: early 30s, I have been abroad for a few years to escape a toxic family dynamic and for work - it pays better with similar costs. Master degree I paid for myself and for which I studied while working night shifts. Real working fluency in four languages, intermediate in another three.

As for the story - it's a lot, I'm aware, and I'll try to sum it up.

Early last year I had a well paying job. I was living together with my girlfriend. We paid 15% of our salaries in rent. Talks of family and kids - I wanted to wait a few months simply because we never lived together and she never worked. Both of us in finance. I, and she accepted, decided to move there so we could have a good life and career and so both of us could work.

I was fired a few days after due to a lie on my work tasks from the employer, combined with a crisis in the work field I was in. Trial period, I spent three months doing nothing. Due to a particular situation I find myself without health insurance. I have to indefinitely postpone a visit where doctors have to check if I'm epileptic, have an aneurysm or a brain cancer. I also have to finish my thesis - later than usual due to my university so a full year to pay.

Two months later it's my birthday. She felt sad once in February and I thought she'd leave me back then, I felt devastated. Well guess what, she ""more or less"" dumps me on my birthday. After giving me a gift - a book that is picking up dust.

She runs away two weeks later. Before that I was so sad I could not talk as I kept on crying. After that... I was still unemployed and due to the rental contract I also had to move.

After she reveals her narcissistic (confirmed by my family who loved her), gaslighting, manipulative side. I find spending 75% of my unemployment on rent whereas she makes three times as much. She shows up unannounced with a lot of colleagues who comment on the house we lived in. A colleague who was planning hotel nights with her to go back to family while we were together, and she was surprised I hated him. Another.... Who knew the backstory and then they went to live together with other people. First time I met him was because they were going out alone on a Saturday night, months before. That day it hailed three times but this caused more damage. She decided to agree on what to share in front of her colleagues, I felt humiliated.

I somehow finish my studies after getting an urgent reasons extension - I told my university everything. I also have to find work and get my health insurance, I manage to find one less than a month after the breakup. I also somehow find a place and move the day before my new job. This was all done urgently, this person I was with clearly told me she did a favour I didn't deserve to not send me on the streets. Two weeks before I meet a group of friends I'm still in touch with. Life is good.

First weeks at work I am dealing with my ex, she does absolutely nothing when it comes to cleaning the old place or anything bureaucratic. I have to give her the landlord's number as I did everything (ok, she didn't speak the local language, but still). At work I also find out that I may have to interact with her for work reasons. I am forced to disclose this to my boss. My office is right in front of hers so I stumble into the people mentioned before. Not helpful.

Two months later I graduate. Only my father and three friends show up. No mother as she's not alive, one brother claimed he's broke, the other is not invited. I start dating again, life seems good.

The week after I do the medical exam I mentioned before. It was all stress, it was that bad that it causes me to take medicine and the symptoms are neurological. That day at work they tell me to take a coffee before I even begin. I finish that day in an ambulance after drinking and running to get the last train - I made a friend though.

As I do things ethically, I was asked to lie on financial statements and the like with the regulator around, I do my job. I ask for procedures as it's all secondhand. I also, as I live abroad, hang out with locals and my friends and not my colleagues, just like I'd do back home.

Well, I am mobbed for months. No help given for work from the supervisors, the entire team goes to lunch without me, the others from my country create a group chat at work for people from there and I'm excluded. I don't take vacation, first year of my life that I don't see the sea and I'm an islander. One single day at the lake. I suffer. As for the dates... One looked promising but she then thought I was too young.

End of September. A longtime friend comes over as she was in the area. One thing leads to another. I wake up with another woman in my bed, breakfast ready and off to work. I end the day being fired, security called on me after I told my boss and HR (who used English and not the local language like they always did) to go where they should. Security had the same happen to them and we become friends. I also end alone as she left, luckily I went to drink with two friends that day. The local bar also offers me a drink as I'm not working anymore.

This long-term girl asks me a visa marriage so she can work in another country. I refuse. My former workplace organised the change in work priorities without me included for a day or two before telling me so imagine my opinion on the team. Workplace also won't send the necessary documents to claim unemployment so I do them myself. The national work agency doesn't take complaints about this.

I take a vacation break and visit family, I had enough for last year. I do meet friends and dates every once in a while.

2025.

It starts off with an interview, it doesn't work out. A girl I met worked there but it wasn't enough. I decided to apply for the country I moved to now.

Of course I'm far, 3 hours away, so I'm not considered. A recruiter asks me to move as soon as possible for a job opportunity, something I want to do and in a different field. In the meantime the unemployment agency tells me to move to another country given the work situation. Someone creates a fake profile on social media of my ex taking a picture I uploaded a year back. As a mutual friend, who introduced us and who moved to the same place, is mentioned he tells her. She says it's me, without any proof and this is on the revenge kind of things, then blocks me everywhere. That fake profile blocks then unblocks me a few months later.

At the lowest I had that mutual friend, even though his girlfriend says she's a friend of both so we discuss when she hears my ex's side and not mine, and a guy I met in high school. Well, I found out what she said behind my back. He claims she made me to be Satan basically. She lied so much, including that I forced her to move there (writing here as it turns out she found a second job there) and complained about me as a person when her friends told her she knew right away (some female friends of hers speak more to me than her). Another friend apparently meets her and she fakes who she is. This mutual friend says they now knew who she is and they had no idea either.

Anyway, a day after my birthday which I celebrated with a dozen friends I very very suddenly move out for this job as I found a very cheap apartment. A now or never thing. I sleep at a friend's place I hadn't seen in years.

Well, about that job... I was interviewed twice, then the mum of the hiring manager suddenly died so he was off for weeks. Then the recruiter, plain unprofessional - would tell clients I didn't know things when I did, would not call when he promised... We argue. He found a second interview where I was also underpaid. I literally fit all of the criteria, including the preferential one. Interview goes well but they pick others with the same profile. I say it's personal as I had to explain what my degree was to the recruiter.

I'm left to move everything myself to this country. Nobody helped me except myself. Nobody. I also have to look for work. I have a temporary stay so I have to hurry up. Money is running out. Country with multiple languages but I'm discriminated as I graduated abroad in the part where they speak the language I'm fluent in... So I have to learn the other one.

I have had 10 interviews at least, hundreds of CVs sent, at least 50 temp agencies contacted. In half of them at least I was told my CV was good, I had experience, I went well but they hired someone else. One of this interviews lasted two hours, in person, but I was the second best and they hired one.

Now I'm almost without money. I made some friends who I see around so nothing deep yet. I had a date but for reasons she had to move back to her country. Hell, I even feel ashamed when I'm asked what I do now. I had an interview where a lot of overtime is clearly expected. Another two hour interview at that company is awaited and it's a temporary contract. A third one is in the other language... And it turns out the hiring manager is a member of a local nationalist political party.

In the meanwhile the other person I lived with in my country... He lives with his girlfriend and that's because I freed the place. Always got a referral for jobs even though he has no certifications. He treats her horribly and she knows it yet she stays.

My ex got a prestigious job in a place she initially went to thanks to me. Before that she relied on her ex, who she cheated with to be with me after years. She never had a job, most of her life was on easy mode, never a financial issue.

I had to move across countries myself, pay a lot of money for my education in a sought in field which I can't use out of my own will, 9 months of unemployment now. My family has never visited me abroad, nor did my friends from my country. I upskilled, fought and kept on fighting... Yet this has no real end in sight. Should I find a good job tomorrow, I'll have spent more time battling the problems my ex and those other people caused than time with my ex.

And what do the helpline workers say? That it was my choice to suffer all of this. The person is a volunteer so I couldn't tell him off...

But well, now I'm here. I fight, despite everything. I am doing everything possible to carry on but it's not enough. Maybe you will cry, I can't get myself to do so anymore.

I guess I learnt resilience but if all this doesn't pay off in millions and real happiness and a loving family it won't be really worth it. I don't feel anyone deserves even a bit of what I went through.

Sorry for the long post - took me 40 minutes to write it.

A little about me:

I’m super into baking (yes, I will bring you banana bread 🍌🍞)

Obsessed with anything true crime or spooky documentaries 👻

I paint when I’m stressed (even though half my stuff ends up looking like colorful blobs lol)

Yoga & hiking are my happy places 🧘‍♀️🥾

Forever down for thrift shopping, coffee shop hopping, and bad karaoke 🎤☕👗


I work remotely, so I don’t get out as much as I probably should—would love to change that! If you’re into spontaneous day trips, cozy nights in, or just want someone to rant about life with, I’m your girl 🥰

WTF?,"I was dating a girl who’d cancel plans last minute, say I didn’t love her, and tell me I’d get tired of her soon. She’d push me away, tell me to find someone else and then complain I didn’t come see her. When I said I would, suddenly her room was “too messy.”

Every time I opened up, she'd say: “If you don’t like it, I’ll just leave.”

She kept making jealousy games, saying people asked if she was single. Then she blocked me on WhatsApp and sent me a text saying she missed me. Her mom even called asking if I loved her.(After the end)

Later, my ex called inviting me to her mom’s birthday. Then said she missed me more than she thought she would… and asked if I wanted to come over. I said no — and she told me I abandoned her, that I chose this. Said I took her happiness away and she just wanted it back.

She wouldn’t let me Take pictures of us about us, meet her family, or even arrive early when we had plans. Every time I opened up emotionally, she disappeared. At one point she even suggested I should use dating apps, then I found her on those exact apps after we broke up.

Once, she said she wasn’t going to a party — so I said I’d go to church. Out of nowhere, she went to the party and pushed me to go to church instead. When I offered to show up early to spend time before the event, she refused. I still bought chocolate, waited outside… her sister saw me and brought me in. She introduced me to her friends as her boyfriend. Later that night, she randomly said: “Should we download an app and find you a hot girl?”


One day, after I was robbed and nearly lost her contact, she didn’t even check on me. Just said: “I won’t text you unless you text me first.”

Eventually, we went to the movies after a long back and forth. She said she was too shy, then that we should “just be friends.” But we went, held hands, kissed, had a sweet day. Still, she never let me near her phone, and only gave me her Instagram after we broke up.

She didn’t want me close to her family. Another time, I said we never went out because she kept flaking — she got mad. Once, she gave me chocolate and we cuddled… then talked about breaking up minutes later.(A matter of hours)

So many moments like this. Constant confusion, mixed signals, hot and cold behavior.

Eventually, I called her and ended things. She cried, blocked me, and said I “sent her to a mental clinic.” Then messaged me saying she missed me more than she expected. We talked again, but I found her on a dating app. When I asked why, she said she was “looking for her friend’s ex.” I said I loved her  and she said she went somewhere and wished I had gone with her.

She called again, invited me to her mom’s birthday  I didn’t go. Then her mom called me asking if I loved her. Later, invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again. She said her dad was mad at me, which made me spiral emotionally. I vented online. She saw it and told me I used her, that she was insecure. Said she prayed for me every day then blocked me and vanished.

To this day… I don’t know what I did so wrong. My feelings for her were real.

1lsnuwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1lsnuwb/my_first_msc_cruise_review/,My first MSC cruise review,"TLDR;
Awesome food, incredible staff, many things to do. You will have soooo much fun.


I’ve just got back from my first ever cruise and since I was very excited to read reviews from others, I thought I would write one hoping that someone would be interested in reading it.

It was a 7-day cruise with MSC Lirica. As I’ve said, this was my first ever cruise and none of my friends or family members have been on one so we decided to go for a smaller ship for now and then maybe in the future we will try bigger ones. It was the 4 of us and we all had an amazing experience and soooo much fun. 

CABINS:
We had the cheapest cabins which were interiors, but they were great. There was enough space for all our stuff, they cleaned it 2x a day always hooking us up with clean towels every single day without even asking for it. Honestly, it might have been better than an ocean view one, because when we turned off the lights it was completely dark so we could get as many sleep as we wanted to.

FOOD:
The food was AMAZING. This was a mediterranian cruise, so the food was more european, but honestly it was awesome. There is always something to eat: pizzas, burgers, fries, wraps, fruits, salads, endless desserts and so on. And when I say always, I mean always. There wasn’t a single time when I couldn’t grab something to eat. In the morning you could have sausages, bacon, multiple kinds of cheese and hams or salamis, gofries, pancakes, etc. We didn’t try a specialty restaurant, but the daily restaurant dinner was something we were always very excited about. We had some of the best foods we have ever had, and in case you didn’t know, you can ask for as many appetizers, main courses and desserts as you want for free. Every night we left the restaurant being very satisfied. The waiters were polite and friendly, we always had a great time chatting with them.

STAFF:
The staff of MSC Lirica includes some of the friendliest people on this planet. We ended up making friends with many bartenders, cruise staffs (animators), waiters. Every single one of them was friendly and welcoming, some of them even learned a few phrases in our language just to have some kind words for us. They made sure we would always have fun. The singers and dancers in the Broadway Theatre were incredible. Every day there was a different show and we left being amazed every night by them. I swear, all the cruise staff members are great and very valuable, there isn’t a negative thing I could say about them.

PROGRAMS:
We didn’t purchase an internet package, so we brought a deck of cards and a board game to make sure we can do something on the sea days. We ended up not even touching any of them, because there is always something to do, even on a smaller ship like this. Table soccer tournament, yoga, dance classes, mini golf, different kind of competitions for prizes (guess the singer, hit the glass, bingo, etc.)


PORTS:

-Kotor:
Our first stop was Kotor, which is a smaller city in Montenegro. Getting off the ship was smooth, nothing difficult. There is an Old Town part of the city which we ended up exploring, had a local beer and got back to the ship. There wasn’t much to see in the city, but it was fun. Recommendation: 6/10

-Syros
Next, we traveled to Syros, Greece. The weather was extremely hot, but we could visit some incredible buildings and swim at a beach. It’s a very small island, nothing much to see, but if you like the vibes of Greece and just hanging out, it’s a nice place to visit. Recommendation: 7/10

-Santorini
Probably not even needed to be said, the highlight of the vacation. 3 cruises went there at the same time, so the island was packed with tourists, but it was bearable. I would recommend grabbing a taxi as soon as you get there and go to Oia, as that is the city they call “postcard city” and if you go later, all the cruisers will be there by that time. Breathtaking views, beautiful buildings with the well-known blue domes.
Downside: getting up to the island. Man, I wish someone told us about it in advance. When we arrived, we saw that many people pay for a donkey to take them up to the top of the island. We didn’t really know what to expect, so we decided not to hop on one and walk up on foot. WORST DECISION EVER. You are using the same pathway the donkeys use and they don’t wait for you. Donkey shit everywhere, donkeys pushing you from the back and from the front. We felt very insecure, there were many people crying and getting scared. It was 588 steps total to climb up to the city. Later, we were told about a cable car, which I wish MSC told us about before hand. If you go to Santorini, trust me, it will be 10 of your best euros ever spent. Don’t even hesitate, use the cable car.
Recommendation: other than getting up to the island, 9/10

-Ancona
Our last stop was Ancona, which is a nice little italian city. You can walk around the city centre, have some italian food and coffee, and just enjoy your time there
Recommendation: 8/10


Overall:
Amazing experience, I can only recommend cruising with MSC Lirica for everyone. Plenty of programs to do, great food, amazing staff. We all had a great time and I’m pretty sure we will go for another one in the near future.

And, coffee remains...

A friend that is unaffected by life's changes.

- وتبقى القهوة (and coffee remains [where و is ""and""])
- صديقة (friend)
- لا تصيبها (not affected [where لا is ""not""])
- متغيرات الحياة ([by] life's changes/life's changeability)

----------------------------------------------------------------

**My questions:**
- are my translations somewhat correct?
- I was confused by وتبقى and unsure if وتبقى القهوة meant ""and coffee remains"" as و was a prefix for تبقى vs القهوة?
- the verb تصيبها is the third-person feminine singular present tense of the أَصَابَ, so تصيبها would mean ""it affects her"" but as لا is before it, لا تصيبها means ""it doesn't affect her""? Also, it's feminine as coffee is a feminine noun?

1lsnpy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lsnpy8/i_always_prefered_hiking_alone/,I always prefered hiking alone,"I always preferred hiking alone. There’s a stillness to the wilderness that you can’t find anywhere else—a quiet that seeps into your bones and drowns out the noise of the world. That’s why I chose the backcountry trails of Great Smoky Mountains National Park for my latest trip. I’d done the research, mapped out the route, and packed for every contingency. For a while, it was perfect.

I’ve always loved the way the forest feels just before dawn. The world holds its breath in the half-light, waiting for the sun to rise and everything to wake up. It’s the kind of quiet that feels alive, like the trees and rocks and dirt are whispering secrets you’ll never quite catch. That’s why I hike. To be alone in that silence, to feel small against the vastness of it all.

This trip was no different, or at least, it wasn’t supposed to be. Five days alone in the backcountry of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, just me and the trail. I’d planned it for months, poring over maps, picking the most isolated route I could find. No crowded campgrounds, no day hikers—just wilderness. That was the point.

The first day went by like clockwork. Miles of winding trails, steep climbs, and views that made every ache in my legs worth it. By the time I set up camp, the sky was fading to orange, and I felt that familiar sense of peace creeping in. I’d done this before, plenty of times, and there was nothing to it but the rhythm of walking, eating, and sleeping. Simple.

That night, I lay awake for a while, staring at the fabric of my tent as the wind whispered through the trees. It wasn’t fear keeping me up. It never was. Just my mind buzzing, running over the day, replaying the crunch of my boots on the dirt and the calls of distant birds. I always found it hard to settle down the first night out.

Eventually, I drifted off, but when I woke up, it was still dark, and the forest didn’t feel quite so quiet anymore.

I woke to the sound of something moving outside my tent.

At first, I thought it was a dream—the kind where you half wake up and everything feels distant, muffled. But then it came again: a soft, deliberate rustling. It wasn’t the wind, and it wasn’t the random scurrying of some small animal. This was heavier. Closer.

My hand crept to the flashlight by my side. I clicked it on and pointed the beam toward the tent walls, but all I saw was nylon glowing pale yellow in the light. I stayed like that, frozen, holding my breath, straining to hear over the hammering of my own pulse.

Nothing. Just silence.

I lay back down, telling myself it was probably a deer or a raccoon. Nothing unusual. It’s the woods, after all. Animals move around at night. I’d heard it before on other trips, so why did it feel different this time?

I didn’t sleep much after that. When the first hint of dawn filtered through the trees, I stepped out of my tent and looked around. The forest was the same as I’d left it the night before—dense, quiet, and indifferent. There was no sign that anything had been near my camp. My food bag still hung where I’d left it, untouched.

Still, I couldn’t shake the unease clinging to me. I told myself it was nothing, just the kind of paranoia that comes with being alone in the woods. But as I packed up and hit the trail again, I couldn’t help checking over my shoulder every now and then.

Just to be sure.

The second day passed in a haze of second-guessing. Every sound in the woods seemed sharper, closer, as if the forest itself was paying attention to me. I knew it wasn’t rational, but knowing didn’t help much.

By midday, the trail had started to climb steeply, twisting up the side of a ridge. The effort was grounding, pulling my focus back to my breath and the burn in my legs. The sun filtered through the trees, casting shifting patterns of light and shadow across the dirt path. It was beautiful.

I reached the top of the ridge just as the sun dipped low, spilling gold and red across the horizon. It was the kind of view that made you forget the world for a moment, and I stood there, catching my breath and trying to let it all sink in. For the first time all day, the tension in my chest eased.

But as I turned to start down the other side, I saw something that stopped me cold.

There, in the dirt, was a footprint.

It wasn’t mine.

It was fresh, too—the edges still sharp, not yet softened by wind or time. And it was pointed toward me, as if whoever left it had been standing there, watching the trail I’d just come up.

My stomach dropped. I hadn’t seen anyone all day, hadn’t even heard so much as a distant voice or the faint crunch of boots on the trail. But someone had been here.

I told myself it didn’t mean anything. This was a national park, after all. Trails crisscrossed everywhere, and it wasn’t impossible that I’d just missed someone. Maybe they were heading the opposite way, or they’d taken a side path.

Still, as I set up camp that evening, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the footprint had been too deliberate. Too still. Like whoever left it had been waiting.

By the time darkness fell, the quiet that I usually loved had turned heavy, oppressive. Every crack of a twig sent my heart racing, and I found myself gripping my flashlight tighter than I needed to, jumping at shadows.

It was just my imagination, I told myself. It had to be. But as I lay in my sleeping bag, eyes fixed on the dark curve of the tent above me, I couldn’t stop listening.

Listening for the sound of someone coming closer.

The third day began with a cold mist rolling through the trees, turning the forest into a sea of shifting shadows. I hadn’t slept much—just fitful stretches where my body would give in, only to jerk awake at the slightest sound. By the time I broke camp, my nerves were raw.

The trail wound deeper into the woods, the underbrush thickening as I moved further from the ridgeline. The air was damp, clinging to my skin, and the silence felt heavier than before, like the forest was waiting for something.

I was halfway through the morning when I heard it.

At first, it was just a murmur—so faint I thought it might have been the wind or the blood pounding in my ears. But as I walked, the sound grew clearer. It wasn’t the wind. It was a voice.

“Keep walking,” it said.

I stopped in my tracks, heart hammering. The voice had been low, steady, and unmistakably human. I spun around, scanning the trail behind me, the trees to either side. Nothing. Just the shifting mist and the quiet press of the woods.

“Who’s there?” I called, my voice cracking in the stillness.

No answer.

I waited, straining to hear, but the forest was silent again. After a few minutes, I told myself it must have been my imagination, the product of too little sleep and too much isolation. I adjusted my pack and kept walking, but the unease followed me like a shadow.

By midday, the voice came again, louder this time.

“Why do you keep going?”

I stopped again, my breath catching in my throat. It felt close, like someone was standing just behind me. I turned quickly, but there was no one there.

“Hello?” I called, my voice trembling now.

The trees seemed to close in around me, the mist swallowing the space between the trunks. I tried to push it out of my mind, to focus on the trail, but the words kept echoing in my head.

Keep walking. Why do you keep going?

I wasn’t sure if it was the forest or something deeper inside me, but the question burrowed into my thoughts. I picked up my pace, my boots crunching against the dirt as I tried to outrun the sound, the weight of those words.

I broke into a run. The voice had been close this time, closer than before. It wasn’t a sound carried by the wind or the creak of a tree—it was real. Someone was out there, following me, waiting until I was alone and far from help.

The forest seemed endless as I sprinted down the trail, the mist swallowing everything around me. My pack thudded heavily against my back, and the weight of it threatened to pull me off balance, but I didn’t dare stop. Every snapping twig, every rustling leaf felt like footsteps closing in behind me.

I finally stopped when my legs screamed for a break. Doubled over and panting, I glanced back at the empty trail. Nothing. The only sound was the wind whispering through the trees.

But I knew better.

I pulled out my knife, a small thing I mostly carried for cutting rope or food packets. It felt useless in my hand, but it was better than nothing.

“Come on!” I shouted, the sound echoing through the trees. “If you’re out there, just show yourself!”

Silence.

I stood there for what felt like hours, waiting for the snap of a branch, the rustle of leaves—anything to tell me I wasn’t imagining this. But there was nothing.

The mist started to thin as the sun burned through the clouds, turning the forest a dull, gray-green. I told myself to keep moving, to stick to my plan. There was a ranger station marked on my map about fifteen miles ahead. If I could make it there by nightfall, I’d be safe.

But as I walked, the voice returned.

“You can’t run forever.”

I spun around, the knife trembling in my hand. The sound had come from somewhere just behind me, low and steady, spoken with a calmness that sent a shiver down my spine.

“Who’s there?” I shouted, my voice shaking. “What do you want?”

No answer.

My eyes darted between the trees, searching for movement, for the glint of an eye or the flash of clothing. There was nothing—just the same endless woods.

But they were out there. I knew it. I could feel it.

I started walking faster, gripping the knife tightly as I scanned the trail. Every rustle of leaves felt deliberate, every shadow too sharp, too dark. My mind raced, replaying every step of the trip so far. Had I seen someone on the first day, hidden in the trees? Had they followed me since then, staying just out of sight?

The voice didn’t come again that afternoon, but the feeling never left.

They were following me. And they were waiting for the right moment.

By the time I made camp that evening, I was running on fumes. The tension in my chest hadn’t eased, and my head pounded with every beat of my heart. I dropped my pack by a cluster of trees and hastily set up the tent, my eyes darting to the shadows beyond the clearing.

I didn’t eat. I didn’t even sit. I just paced the perimeter of the camp, gripping my knife like a lifeline. The quiet of the forest was no longer a comfort—it was a trap, a vacuum where I could hear every stray crack and rustle, amplified and suspicious.

I kept telling myself I was being careful, but the truth was, I was waiting. Waiting for the voice to come back. Waiting for whoever it was to step into the firelight and show themselves. My nerves were stretched so thin that even the faintest sound—a falling pinecone, the snap of a twig—made me flinch.

The hours crawled by. I didn’t sleep, didn’t even try. The fear kept me upright, kept me moving. When the first hint of dawn finally broke through the trees, I felt a fleeting sense of relief. But it didn’t last.

That was when I heard footsteps on the trail.

I froze, my body going cold. They were coming. I gripped my knife tighter, turning toward the sound, every muscle in my body taut and ready. The figure emerged slowly, stepping through the trees with a relaxed gait.

“Morning!” the hiker called out, their voice cheery and casual, as if this was just another day on the trail. They looked like they’d been out here for a while—weathered clothes, a well-worn pack.

But I knew better.

“It’s you,” I said, my voice low and uneven.

The hiker frowned, tilting their head. “Uh, sorry? Do I know you?”

“You’ve been following me,” I snapped, stepping toward them. “I’ve seen you. Heard you. You think I don’t know what you’re doing?”

Their smile faltered, replaced by confusion. “Hey, man, I think you’ve got the wrong—”

“Don’t lie to me!” I shouted, cutting them off. My voice was raw now, rising with panic. “Why are you doing this? What do you want from me?”

The hiker’s eyes widened, and they took a step back, hands raised. “Whoa, okay, calm down. I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

But I couldn’t stop. The words spilled out in a frantic rush, accusations and questions tumbling over each other. I stepped closer, the knife trembling in my hand.

“Stay away from me!” I yelled, my voice cracking. “I’m not going to let you get me!”

The hiker’s expression shifted from confusion to fear. They turned and bolted, their footsteps fading quickly down the trail.

For a long moment, I stood there, trembling, the knife still clenched in my hand. My heart pounded so hard it hurt, and the air felt too thin to breathe.

When I finally came back to myself, I realized I couldn’t stay here. Whoever they were, they’d come back, maybe with others. I had to keep moving, get farther away.

I shoved everything into my pack haphazardly, barely bothering to break down the tent properly. The forest seemed to close in around me as I fled down the trail, the shadows deeper than they should have been, the silence pressing against my ears like a warning.

I didn’t look back.

The trail stretched endlessly ahead, twisting and disappearing into the dense underbrush. My legs burned with each step, but I couldn’t stop. The fear that had propelled me before was now something sharper, more desperate. The encounter with the hiker replayed in my mind, but no matter how I tried to rationalize it, my gut told me I’d been right. I had scared them off, but only for now.

As I pushed forward, the voice came again, slipping through the trees like smoke.

“You should have got me when you had the chance,” it said, low and mocking.

I whipped around, scanning the forest behind me. The trees were still, the underbrush quiet, but the voice lingered, curling around my thoughts.

“Keep running,” it continued, the words stretching into a chuckle. “I’ll catch you.”

My breath hitched, and I quickened my pace, my heart hammering in my chest. The laughter followed me, faint but constant, growing louder whenever I hesitated. It wasn’t just words anymore—it was a presence, something I couldn’t shake no matter how far I went.

By the time I reached the ranger station, my nerves were raw. It was a small cabin tucked into a clearing, the kind of place that should have felt safe. But as I approached, I saw movement through the windows—figures inside, talking, gesturing.

They were waiting for me.

I froze, just out of sight, my stomach churning. There were at least three of them, their backs turned to the window. One of them was holding something—was that a walkie-talkie?

I stepped closer, trying to hear through the thick glass.

“Caucasian male, 25,” a voice crackled faintly, distorted by static.

I stumbled back, nearly tripping over a root. They were looking for me. They’d followed me here, just like I’d known they would.

“Jamie Bowman,” the voice on the walkie-talkie said, clear this time.

The sound of my name made my blood run cold. My pack felt heavier as I turned and slipped away from the clearing, keeping low and quiet. The laughter followed me again, faint at first but growing louder as I fled.

“They’re all in on it,” the voice said, almost gleeful now. “You can’t trust anyone. You know that, don’t you?”

I didn’t answer, didn’t let myself think. My only goal was to get as far from that station as possible.

I walked until my legs felt like they would give out, the trail narrowing and becoming rougher the deeper I went. Finally, when the last light of day had faded, I stopped. The forest was darker here, the air colder. It wasn’t much, but it would have to do.

Setting up camp was a rushed, clumsy affair. My hands shook as I tied the last line of the tent, and I didn’t bother with a fire. The shadows seemed to move just outside my vision, and every snap of a twig felt like a footstep.

I sat in the tent, clutching my knife and listening to the night. The voice was quieter now, but it was still there, just beneath the surface, like the steady hum of a wasp nest.

“They’ll find you,” it whispered.

And then it laughed.

The exhaustion had won in the end. I must have dozed off sometime in the early hours of the morning, my body collapsing under the weight of fear and fatigue. I awoke with a jolt, the cold air biting my face, the knife still clenched tightly in my hand. For a moment, everything felt still, almost peaceful.

The tent glowed faintly in the early light, and outside, the quiet hush of snow blanketed the forest. It was beautiful, serene.

But then it all came rushing back. The voice. The footsteps. The laughter. My chest tightened as I scrambled upright, fumbling with the zipper of the tent. My knife was ready in my trembling hand as I burst outside, expecting—no, knowing—that someone would be there, waiting.

Nothing.

The forest stretched out before me, silent except for the distant trill of birds. Snow coated the ground in a soft, unbroken layer. I turned in frantic circles, scanning every tree, every shadow, but there was no sign of movement. No footprints, no broken branches.

I forced myself to walk the perimeter of the campsite, my boots crunching in the snow. Every step felt heavier, the fear coiling tighter in my stomach. Whoever was out there either couldn’t find me or didn’t want to leave a trail.

Or they were still watching, waiting for the perfect moment.

When I finally stopped searching, I realized how still the air was. The snow had dampened all sound, muting even the rustle of the trees. It felt suffocating, like the forest itself was holding its breath.

I tried to shake the thought off and went back to my tent. The gas stove came to life with a reassuring hiss, and I set a pot of water to boil. As the steam rose, I forced myself to eat. Dehydrated eggs and instant coffee tasted like ash in my mouth, but I needed the energy. My hands were steady now, but my mind was still spinning.

Every second felt like a gamble. Sitting still meant giving them time to close in, but moving meant risking stumbling into them on the trail.

The warmth of the coffee helped, but it didn’t clear my head. I packed up camp methodically, my movements automatic, my ears straining for any sound out of place.

By the time I slung my pack onto my shoulders, the sun was higher, casting long shadows across the pristine snow. The trail ahead wound through a denser patch of forest, dark and narrow. I swallowed hard and started walking.

Each step felt like a surrender, like I was walking deeper into a trap I couldn’t see. But I had no choice. The next campsite wasn’t far, just a few miles down the trail. If I could keep moving, if I could stay ahead of whatever was out there, I’d be safe.

Or at least, I’d have a chance.

The snow had started to melt in patches under the afternoon sun, leaving the trail slick with mud. My boots slipped now and then, and I had to focus on each step to keep my balance. The cold air bit at my cheeks, but I welcomed the sting—it was something real, something grounding.

I’d been walking for hours, the weight of my pack digging into my shoulders, the knife now strapped securely to my belt. The trail twisted through the trees, darker now as the sun dipped lower, casting long shadows that stretched like grasping fingers.

As I rounded a bend, my heart stopped.

Ahead, in the middle of the trail, stood a figure.

They were just far enough away that I couldn’t make out the details. The shadows of the trees fell over them, cloaking their features, but I could see their outline clearly enough to know something wasn’t right.

They were tall. Too tall. Taller than anyone I’d ever seen in person, easily seven or eight feet.

I froze, my breath caught in my throat. My hand instinctively went to the knife at my belt, fingers tightening around the handle. The figure didn’t move, didn’t shift an inch. They just stood there, staring at me.

“Hello?” I called out, my voice cracking.

No response.

The forest seemed to hold its breath, the air thick with an unnatural stillness. And then, they made a sound—a low, guttural growl.

It wasn’t an animal’s growl, not deep enough, not wild enough. It sounded…human. Like someone trying to mimic an animal, dragging the sound up from their chest with an effort that sent shivers down my spine.

“Who are you?” I demanded, my voice louder now, though it quavered.

The figure didn’t answer. They didn’t move. They just kept growling, the sound rising and falling like a predator sizing up its prey.

I took a shaky step back, then another. My heart pounded so hard it felt like it might burst from my chest. I didn’t dare take my eyes off the figure, but something in the back of my mind whispered that this couldn’t be real. No one could be that tall, could they?

The growling stopped, and for a terrifying moment, the silence returned. The figure tilted their head ever so slightly, like they were curious.

I couldn’t take it anymore. My instincts screamed at me to run, to get as far away from this thing—this person—as I could.

I turned and bolted back up the trail, my boots skidding on the melting snow. The branches clawed at my jacket as I veered off the path, my breath coming in ragged gasps. I didn’t dare look back.

Even as I ran, the growl echoed in my mind, more chilling than any scream or laugh could have been. It wasn’t just a sound. It was a promise.

I didn’t know how long I’d been running. Hours? Minutes? Time had become a blur, a jumbled mess of fear and instinct. My chest burned, my legs screamed in protest, but I kept pushing, driven by that growing sense of something following me, something out there in the dark, getting closer with every step.  

But then I slipped.  

My foot caught on something hidden beneath the snow—maybe a root, or a rock—and before I could react, I went down hard. The impact sent a sharp jolt of pain up my leg, and I gasped as my ankle twisted beneath me. I tried to get up, tried to scramble to my feet, but my ankle buckled under my weight.  

A sickening wave of nausea hit me as I heard the pop—the sound of bone and tendon giving way under pressure.  

""Shit,"" I muttered, clutching my ankle as I fell back into the snow. It was too much.  

I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to will the pain away, but it was unbearable. I could feel the blood rushing to the injury, my ankle swelling quickly, the heat spreading out of control. It throbbed, searing, the kind of pain that made you question whether you'd ever walk again.  

The darkness around me pressed in, thick and heavy. The forest felt alive, like the trees were closing in, their shadows reaching out to touch me. I couldn’t move, couldn’t even think.  

I tried to steady my breathing, but the panic started to rise again. Was it here? Was it waiting? My mind raced, and I kept expecting to hear the growl again, to see that impossibly tall figure creeping from the darkness.  

But there was nothing.  

I don’t know how long I sat there, in the cold and the pain, the shadows swallowing the world around me. The swelling in my ankle was already bad—way worse than I’d thought. The throbbing pulsed through my body, making my stomach churn. But no matter how much I tried to move, the pain wouldn’t let me.  

I had to rest. There was no other choice.  

It was dark now, much darker than it should’ve been this early in the night. I could barely make out the outline of the trees around me. Everything felt wrong. I felt so small, so fragile, alone in a forest that was suddenly very much alive and watching.  

I wanted to get up, to run again, to push through the pain and the terror, but the thought of trying to stand on my swollen ankle made my stomach drop.  

“Fuck,” I whispered under my breath, my voice hoarse. “I can’t.”  

The snow around me had stopped falling, leaving the air even colder. The silence was oppressive, suffocating, and the only sound was my ragged breathing.

I tried to focus on anything but the pain, anything but the voice that still clung to the edges of my thoughts. But it was hard, harder than it had been before. The forest felt too still, too empty, and in the silence, I could almost hear the growl again, echoing in the distance.  

I knew I should move. I knew I needed to. But I couldn’t. Not with my ankle like this.  

So I stayed there, in the dark, waiting for something to change. Something—anything—to make the pain stop. Or at least make me forget the thing that was out there, hunting me.

When I woke, I could barely tell if it was morning or if the darkness had just shifted. My body ached, and my ankle throbbed relentlessly, but I was alive. That was something, at least.

I hadn’t meant to fall asleep. I hadn’t meant to rest. But somewhere, in the dark hours, my exhaustion overtook the fear. I must’ve curled up beneath a bush, somewhere sheltered from the wind. The cold had seeped into my bones, but the sleep had been deeper than I realized. I stretched carefully, cradling my swollen ankle against my chest for a moment, the sharp bite of pain reminding me just how vulnerable I was. I couldn’t stay here.

I glanced around—nothing. No tall, shadowy figure, no growl in the distance. The world was quiet, it gave me a moment of peace, however fleeting it might be. I could almost convince myself that nothing had happened, that I was simply out on another hike, lost in the wilderness, nursing an injury.

But then the dread crept in again, slow and steady, like the drip of water falling from a leaf. I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was out there, still, just beyond the trees, waiting. Watching.

I pushed myself up onto one foot, my injured ankle giving a painful twist as I tried to put weight on it. I gritted my teeth, the frustration of it flooding over me. But I couldn’t afford to stop. I couldn’t stay in one place for long.

I limped along the trail, moving as fast as my swollen ankle would allow, the forest closing in around me, the towering trees casting long, dark shadows. It was impossible to get a sense of direction in the wilderness. The path, now barely visible beneath the snow, seemed to stretch endlessly forward, twisting and turning as if it had no destination. But I couldn’t go back. That wasn’t an option anymore.

By midday, I came across something unexpected.

A small shack stood off the trail, half-hidden by trees and overgrowth. Its roof sagged, the wood faded with age, and it looked like it had been abandoned for years. The sight of it made my heart skip a beat, not out of relief, but from the sharp edge of suspicion. A shack in the middle of nowhere? No one else had passed me on the trail. Had someone left it here for me? To trap me?

I hesitated, eyes darting around, scanning the perimeter as I moved toward it. Nothing. No signs of life. The air was too still.

I limped to the door, the creaking of the wood beneath my feet louder than I expected. I tugged at the handle, half-expecting it to be locked, but it opened with ease, revealing a small, dimly lit room. Dust hung thick in the air, and old cobwebs decorated the corners.

I stepped inside, pulling the door shut behind me with a careful hand, and surveyed the room. It was small, with a single window and a fireplace long cold. There were two old chairs by a rickety table and a rusted tin kettle on the floor. The shelves, though empty, gave the place a lived-in feel, as though someone had been here not too long ago.

I didn’t trust it. I didn’t trust anything anymore.

I moved quickly, shifting the chairs to block the door. I needed to be sure no one could get in. I didn’t know why—my mind was racing again, tangled in that loop of paranoia. It felt like I was being hunted, like I was being watched, and if I let my guard down for a second, it’d be over.

Once the door was barricaded, I hobbled over to the corner of the shack, where the broken windows provided just enough light to set up a small camp. I pulled out my stove and began heating up some food, my movements quick and jerky. I couldn’t stay still for too long. I couldn’t. The voice in the back of my head was getting louder again, a hum beneath the surface, as if it knew something I didn’t.

I ate quickly, not tasting the food, not even sure if I could stomach it. My thoughts were too chaotic, jumping from one thing to another, searching for anything to make sense of the madness. The shack, the figure, the growling—it all felt so real, and yet, so distant.

I sat with my back against the wall, listening to the wind howl outside. The shack groaned with every gust, but it held firm. For the moment, at least, I was safe.

But deep down, I knew: safety didn’t matter. Not anymore.

I woke with a start, my eyes snapping open as I heard the voice.

“I found you.”

The words hung in the air, cold and cutting, like they were meant to tear through the fragile shell of security I’d built for myself. The tone was unmistakable—menacing, dripping with a kind of twisted pleasure, like someone relishing a victory. My heart shot into my throat as the air around me seemed to freeze.

I froze too, my breath caught in my chest, pulse thundering in my ears. I didn’t move. Didn’t dare.

The voice—that voice—echoed in my mind, sharp and taunting. I had to look. I had to see if it was real. Was it them? Was it the thing that had been following me? Watching me?

I didn’t wait long before my eyes darted to the front window of the shack, the small gap between the weathered wooden boards offering just enough of a view. My heart slammed against my ribs as I saw the figure.

Just a glimpse.

A tall shadow, tall like before, standing there, just outside the door. For a split second, I saw the outline of a person—a man?—too tall to be real, with long limbs and a figure that didn’t seem to fit the proportions of a human body. It was there, standing in the cold, and then, as quickly as it had appeared, it disappeared.

The figure darted off, vanishing into the snow-covered woods.

I felt a sickening wave of panic crash over me, my thoughts swirling in a desperate whirl of terror. It was here. It was real. It had found me.

But my legs wouldn’t move. I wanted to run, to chase it, to confront it, but I couldn’t. The fear paralyzed me, my body locked in place as my mind raced. What did it want? Why was it here? What had I done to deserve this?

I strained my ears, trying to hear any sound outside, any sign that the figure was still nearby. But there was nothing. The wind howled, but no footsteps followed. No growl, no voice.

Was it still out there? Waiting?

The silence in the shack seemed deafening now, suffocating, pressing in on me from all sides. My body shook uncontrollably. My hand found the knife at my side, my fingers trembling as I gripped the hilt. It was the only thing that made me feel even the slightest bit of control.

I’m not alone. I’m not alone.

I repeated the thought like a mantra, trying to steady myself, to convince myself that I was safe. But even as I sat there, heart hammering, eyes darting to every corner of the room, I knew the truth. I wasn’t safe. I wasn’t safe anywhere.

The worst part? I couldn’t even tell if it was real. Was it all in my head? Or was it something else—something much worse?

I didn’t know. I couldn’t know. And that was the scariest thing of all.

Jamie hadn’t meant to fall asleep again, but somewhere between the overwhelming exhaustion and the fear that wrapped its icy fingers around his mind, he’d drifted off, slumped against the wall in a half-sitting position. The knife was still clutched in his hand, but even that small semblance of control couldn’t shield him from what was coming.

The sound was sudden. So sudden, it startled him awake with a gasp. The front door of the shack—weak and old as it was—buckled under the force of a single, powerful kick. The sound of wood splintering and the chair he’d used to block it breaking apart echoed in the small, claustrophobic space, and Jamie’s heart lurched in his chest.

A sharp, muffled voice cut through the panic building in his chest. “We found you, Jamie. We got you, Jamie.”

Jamie’s eyes flew open, his blood running cold. They were here. The people who had been after him. The ones who wanted him. The ones who had been hunting him.

He tried to scramble back, to push himself into the corner, but before he could react, two figures were upon him, grabbing at his arms, pulling him to his feet. Their grip was tight, too tight. He could feel their fingers digging into his skin, and in the haze of terror, he thought he could hear their voices, taunting him with his name.

“We found you, Jamie.” The words sliced through the air, and his body went into panic mode. He thrashed against their hold, trying to break free, kicking, squirming, doing everything he could to get away from them. He had to run. He had to escape.

But his body felt sluggish, weak. The world around him was spinning, his head fuzzy from lack of sleep, from the strain of the past few days. His ankle—swollen and painful—was no help either, and every movement sent sharp stabs of pain through his leg.

“Stop fighting, Jamie. You’re not getting away this time.”

Another pair of hands grabbed his shoulders, pulling him tighter, and he screamed, struggling harder. He couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think, couldn’t make sense of anything. They were stronger. They were too strong.

The voices in his head were screaming now, too, drowning out the outside world.

You shouldn’t have left. You should’ve stayed hidden. You can’t outrun this. They’re here. They’ve got you. You’ll never escape.

He fought against the voices, tried to shake them off, tried to fight them the way he fought the men holding him down. His breathing was ragged, each inhale a desperate gasp.

But the more he struggled, the more his body betrayed him. His muscles screamed, his mind faltered, and his resistance grew weaker with each passing second. The men weren’t letting go. His fight was over.

Suddenly, the world shifted, and he was on his back, staring up at the cracked ceiling, hands bound to his sides. His pulse thundered in his ears. Through his blurred vision, he saw four figures looming above him, their faces dimmed by shadows and the remnants of the doorframe blocking out the light.

One of them kneeled down, his voice softer now, a strange calmness lacing the words. ""Jamie, you're safe. You’re not alone anymore.""

But Jamie didn’t understand. Safe? Alone? What were they talking about?

His breathing was coming in short gasps, his heart racing. His mind felt like it was cracking, splintering, pieces falling into places he didn’t recognize. He could barely hear the voices around him.

“We found him, thank God,” one of the figures said, their voice a mix of relief and exhaustion.

The others seemed to echo their sentiments, but Jamie didn’t hear them. His mind was somewhere far away. The voices were too loud, too overwhelming, too real.

And then, another voice—this one belonging to the man who had spoken to him before—cut through the haze. “We need to get him back. The search party’s going to be waiting.”

Jamie’s body tensed, and panic surged again, but the hands that held him weren’t the same hands as before. They were firm but gentle, leading him somewhere, somewhere away from the shack. Somewhere away from the voices. But all he could feel was the tremble in his limbs, the weight of his thoughts closing in.

Jamie wasn’t sure what was real anymore.

This is a throwaway because I never thought I’d be one of the stories you’d read out loud while sipping coffee and raising your eyebrow in disbelief, but here we are.

Let’s just get into it.

I (27F) was dating Jason (28M) for nearly four years. We lived together for two, shared bills, split groceries, and had a running Pinterest board titled “Our Future Home.” You know, couple stuff. We were talking about getting engaged sometime this year.

My best friend, Chris (30F), has been in my life since I was a teenager. We were thick as thieves. She used to call me her “ride-or-die.” She even said once, “If you ever got married, I’d plan the bachelorette trip myself.” (Oh honey… if only I knew.)

Jason and Chris got along really well — too well, in hindsight. I used to joke about it. “Wow, I swear y’all hang out more than we do!” Hahaha. So funny. So naïve.

A few months ago, things started getting… weird.

Jason suddenly became attached to his phone like it was surgically fused to his hand. Chris pulled away from me emotionally but was always happy to check in on Jason.

They started making plans without me. “Oh, we just grabbed a quick bite after work!” “We ran into each other at the gym!” “We were just catching up!” Catching up on what, exactly? My patience?

Jason’s siblings — his sister and younger brother — also started acting different. Cold. Like I was the awkward outsider at a family dinner I used to help plan. I figured I had done something wrong. Spoiler alert: I hadn’t. I was just being slowly replaced and no one told me.

Then one weekend, Jason said he had to go out of town for a “family thing.” I helped him pack. Kissed him goodbye. Sent him off with snacks and good wishes like a supportive girlfriend.

Chris — being Chris — posted a cozy little Instagram story that same night. A wine glass. A fireplace. Two sets of legs. Except I recognized one of those sets of legs. The jeans. The sneakers. They were Jason’s. I bought those shoes.

I didn’t say anything right away. I wanted to be wrong. But something in my gut said I wasn’t.

When Jason got back, I waited until he fell asleep, and I checked the iPad he’d forgotten to log out of. His iMessages were synced.

Let me just say: I wish I hadn’t looked, but also, thank God I did.

He and Chris had been hooking up for over a year. There were flirty messages, gross sexts, voice notes, inside jokes, screenshots of conversations with his siblings — yes, his siblings were cheering them on.

There were messages like:

“She’s still clueless, lol.”
“Just tell her already, bro.”
“You and Chris are way better together anyway.”

They were hiding a whole-ass relationship from me while I was cooking dinner for them. Jason even said:

“It’s hard laying next to her when I wish it was you.”

Sir. You’re in my bed. Eating my snacks. With my Hulu login.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t key cars. I packed a bag, went to my cousin’s place, and thought it over.

Two days later, I calmly told Jason I knew. That I saw everything. His reaction?

“You went through my messages? That’s a serious violation of trust.”

…I think my soul briefly left my body.

Then came the gaslighting:

“You always do this. You’re insecure. You push people away with your drama.”

I push people away?!? Boy, you are emotionally cheating (and probably physically) with my best friend and I’m the dramatic one?

Anyway.

I blocked Chris. She sent a long, teary “It just happened” message. I didn’t care.

But I didn’t stop there.

I sent the messages, screenshots, and voice notes to Jason’s parents and Chris’s mom. Not to be petty — but because I was tired of feeling like the crazy one while they told their families I was “emotionally unstable” and “clingy.”

Jason had been painting me as the bad guy to his family for months. His mom told me I was “cold” toward him and needed to “be more understanding.” After she saw the truth, she apologized. Genuinely. Chris’s mom? She was silent for a minute and just said, “I’m sorry you had to go through this.”

Now Jason and Chris are officially together. Soft-launching themselves like nobody died. “Sometimes love grows where you least expect it.”

Yeah — like in the shadow of betrayal.

Now Jason’s siblings and a few mutuals are saying I “crossed a line” and made everything “awkward between families” and that I should’ve just walked away “like a mature adult.”

So Reddit… Am I the ahole for refusing to let them lie about me and exposing them to their families?**

Or should I have just taken the L quietly while they made me look like the bitter ex?",192,1751759903.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,39,0.97,False

I’m soft-spoken, playful, dry-witted, and easy to be around once I warm up.

I want to create a peaceful, loving home, cook often, care deeply, and be a genuine source of warmth and support for the man I choose.

That said, my time and energy are valuable and I don’t stretch them thin. I stay busy, so I don’t make room for just anyone. I’m looking for one emotionally intelligent, financially secure man who’s genuinely interested in building a long-term connection. Someone confident, consistent, kind, and clear about what he wants.

Physically, I’ve been drawn to all types. My past partners have ranged from slim to fit to a little soft around the edges. What they had in common was that they took care of themselves. Impeccable hygiene, great style, and glasses with a cute smile behind them go a long way with me. I’m into men who look put together, smell good, and carry themselves with quiet confidence.

A little more about me

My happy places are quiet coffee shops, cozy bookstores, fancy dumpling spots, and live music venues. I love cooking, traveling, and gaming on both PC and Xbox. I have a cat and a long bucket list that includes visiting a Samoyed café in South Korea. I’m the kind of person who’s just as happy dressed up at a rooftop bar as I am curled up on the couch splitting takeout with someone I adore.

If you’re someone who’s looking for more than surface-level connection, who wants to be cared for just as much as you care, and who’s building a life where someone like me would thrive, then we might just click.

I’d say it began around 16, when the insomnia went away it’s like it switched around completely and I started feeling exhausted all of the time, over the years I’ve gone to the doctors several times with the concern that I feel constantly fatigued and it got to a point where it took multiple coffees and caffeinated tablets just to get through college which didn’t really help all too much anyway because I’d still need to take naps inbetween classes - I was quite literally known as the ‘girl who will sleep anywhere’ which was funny at the time but looking back I shouldn’t have had to do that just to get through my day especially as a teenager, and then work as an adult, yet whenever they’ve taken bloods and I’ve returned to the doctors they’ve said everything is fine apart from a period where they said I had ‘mild anaemia’ with both iron and folic but they expressed that it really was minimal that isn’t even prevalent anymore . For the past year it’s slowly been getting worse, and still they’re adamant there’s no cause, but I’m sleeping 6-7 hours a night which is normal for me, often having a 3-5 hour nap most days and I’m still tired and could easily lay down and sleep more at any given time. I understand oversleeping can still make you feel tired but whether I get a normal nights rest a night with and avoid napping or with the addition of naps I feel the exact same level of fatigued - I do suffer with occasional restless legs but it’s very rare, usually when I’m overly stressed, but I can’t seem to figure out what could me making me so tired. I’ve always been a coffee drinker, but I’ve also tried cutting out caffeine for extended periods which didn’t make a difference honestly because coffee/tea has never really had much of an effect, I just enjoy hot beverages if I’m honest. I really need some advice on what could possibly be going on, or how to at least remedy this type of fatigue because it’s really starting to effect me mentally feeling like I’m stuck this way because nobody can figure out a cause, I’m generally an active person despite the tiredness and try to walk often but it’s becoming harder and harder every day and I don’t want to give up my activity over some apparent non-issue. I’m happy to answer any questions about lifestyle, it just seems no matter what vitamins I take, lifestyle changes I make it never does a thing and it’s to a point where it’s upsetting me quite a lot.

# How to run a successful Hackathon

A step-by-step guide by [Joshua Tauberer](http://razor.occams.info/) based on running and participating in many hackathons.

These notes come from five successful years of [Open Data Day DC](http://dc.opendataday.org/) and other civic hackathons that I’ve run, sponsored, or participated in.

The ideas have been inspired by many individuals, especially including my Open Data Day DC co-organizers Eric Mill, Sam Lee, Katherine Townsend, and Julia Bezgacheva, as well as Justin Grimes, Matt Bailey, Leah Bannon, Laurenellen McCann, and Greg Bloom.

# What is a hackathon?

# Defined

I define “hackathon” very broadly:

* Hacking is creative problem solving. (It does not have to involve technology.)
* A hackathon is any event of any duration where people come together to solve problems. Most hackathons I’ve run also have a parallel track for workshops.

Participants typically form groups of about 2-5 individuals, take out their laptops (if the event is technology themed), and dive into problems. Training workshops are a great parallel track especially for newcomers but also for all participants.

# Positive energy

Hackathons have gotten a bad rap because of *some* that have an unhealthy, competitive structure, and for setting unrealistic expectations. Don’t run a hackathon like that and you’ll be on the right track. Here are the goals I keep in mind:

* Strengthen the community that the hackathon is for.
* Be welcoming to newcomers to the community.
* Provide an opportunity for participants to learn something new.
* Provide a space and a time for participants to make headway on problems they are interested in.

Don’t expect to have actually solved a problem by the end of the hackathon. Real life problems are hard! Think of the hackathon as a pit-stop on a long journey to solve problems or as a training session to prepare participants for solving problems.

Since you’re not going to solve a problem, don’t put unrealistic (and unhealthy) pressure on your participants. Don’t stay up all night, don’t pump participants with caffeine, and don’t make winners and losers. Just don’t. There has never been beer, competitions, or time pressure at my hackathons. Participants should come energized and be greeted with positive energy.

# Wait — maybe a hackathon isn’t the right thing

My notes below are mostly logistical and assume a technology-centric approach. I take it for granted that you want to run a hackathon. But read [So You Think You Want to Run a Hackathon? Think Again](https://medium.com/@elle_mccann/so-you-think-you-want-to-run-a-hackathon-think-again-f96cd7df246a) by Laurenellen McCann for thoughts on other (and sometimes better) ways of engaging a community.

Also consider not calling your event a “hackathon”. Not everyone will know what you mean, and “hacking” might make it [less likely that all groups will feel welcome](https://twitter.com/erinrwhite/status/707956467224190976).

If the goal of your hackathon is to market a product, stop here and read a different guide. Your goals and my goals are not the same.

# Welcoming newcomers

The hardest thing about running a successful hackathon is being welcoming to newcomers and helping them get involved in an activity.

Newcomers often suffer from “[imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)”, the feeling that they don’t belong because they don’t have skills, aren’t smart enough, etc. They’re wrong, of course, but until they feel like they belong they will not be able to have a fulfilling experience. It is the hackathon organizer’s job to help them realize they have something to contribute.

First time hackathon participants are often overwhelmed when it comes time to finding a project to work on. They may not yet know how to relate their own skills to the sorts of projects being worked on. Knowing how to be useful is a skill in itself. You will need to guide them to a project and through a process for them to realize how they can contribute. If you have too many lost participants and not enough help in getting them started on a project, they will leave — try to avoid that.

The hackathon organizer must make sure that everyone has something to do. One way to do this is to have a list of project leaders ahead of time: people you know are coming with particular projects that you can guide other participants to. And you can work to make sure your hacking projects are ready to accept newcomers. You can also hold non-project activities — workshops, described below — which are easier for newcomers to join.

You could also consider pairing newcomers with mentors or holding a pre-event session just for newcomers, as [Wikimedia recently did](https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/05/31/vienna-hackathon-learnings/).

# Hacking

The hacking track is for participants to dive into problems. Often groups of 2-5 individuals form around a project, such as building a new data visualization, writing a document, or collaboratively investigating a problem. Participants take out their laptops, connect to power and wifi, and get working.

Hacking begins with project introductions. Participants that bring projects to the event have an opportunity to briefly (1 minute max) explain what they are working on at the very start of the event so that other participants can join that project. At the end of the event, a wrap-up session gives each project a chance to demonstrate some accomplishments.

# Cultivating Good Projects

Not every project makes a good hackathon project. It is extremely important to maximize the following qualities in the projects at your event:

* **Clearly articulated.** Projects should have a clear question or problem they are trying to solve *plus* a reasonably specific proposed solution.
* **Attainable.** Most projects will accomplish about 25% of what they think they can accomplish in the limited time they have. Manage each project’s goals so participants are able to feel accomplished at the end of the session, not interrupted.
* **Easy to onboard newcomers.** Projects should have ready-to-go tasks for newcomers with a variety of skills and at a variety of skill levels. For coding projects, these tasks can’t require an intimate understanding of the code base, and make sure the build environment can be spun up in less than 20 minutes. Make a list of tasks or create github issues ahead of time!
* **Led by a stakeholder.** A stakeholder (or “subject matter expert”) guides a project to real-world relevance. Projects without a stakeholder can “solve” a problem that doesn’t exist. Ideally the leader (or one of the leaders) is a stakeholder, or a good proxy for a stakeholder. I strongly recommend reviewing Laurenellen McCann’s [Build With, Not For](http://www.buildwith.org/) series on involving stakeholders in all civic tech work. Additionally, it is never enough for a project leader to just be an ideas person. Beware when the leader is a stakeholder but can’t foresee how he or she might be implementing along with the rest of the team.
* **Organized.** For projects with four or more members, especially newcomers, the project leader’s role should be to coordinate, ensuring each team member has something to work on and helping to welcome new team members.

Treat these bullets like a checklist. Projects that think about themselves in terms of these qualities tend to be happier and more productive.

If you know what projects are going to be worked on at the event, the earlier you can get those projects thinking about this the better. Meet with project leads and talk about these components of their project ahead of time if possible. As an organizer, having this information about projects can also help you route participants to projects they may want to work on.

# At Themed Hackathons

A themed hackathon is one in which the projects are confined to a particular problem: such as [food sustainability](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/food-forum/hackathon) or [returning citizens](http://rebuildingreentry.com/). Themed hackathons are able to attract subject matter experts (something that open-ended hackathons like Open Data Day DC are not good at), and projects typically revolve around problems that the subject matter experts bring to the table.

When themed hackathons are also technology hackathons, there is a common problem: Subject matter experts can readily identify problems in their field but cannot always turn those problems into workable technology projects. Other participants may be ready to apply their skills but not know anything about the hackathon’s theme. Bridging that gap requires careful planning ahead of time.

What often results is a division of the room into three groups:

1. Subject matter experts and other participants successfully working together.
2. Subject matter experts working with other subject matter experts on problem investigation but not implementation.
3. Other participants struggling to find something relevant to work on / implementing a solution of minimal value to solving the theme’s actual problems.

\#1 is great. #2 is fine if the group is happy. But #3 is bad: participants without subject matter guidance will feel lost. To avoid this, make sure you have enough workable projects for everyone ahead of the event. Work with the subject matter experts before the event to turn their problems into projects. See the section Cultivating Good Projects above to ensure there is a coherent question, that the necessary resources exist (e.g. datasets), and that the skills needed for the project match the skills expected to be brought by other participants (and in sufficient quantity).

Additionally, a subject matter expert may propose many ideas but he or she can only effectively participate in a single project during the event, so ensure that there is at least one subject matter expert + workable project for about every four non-expert participants.

# Placing Newcomers into New Projects

Onboarding participants onto existing projects can be very difficult. It is one of the hardest parts of hacking. So have ideas for new projects that are especially easy for participants to get started with if they can’t join an existing project. Having project ideas ready is especially important if you do not expect many participants to bring projects! And always be open to project ideas from participants. A project of one, meaning someone working alone, is okay too!

# Other Tips

Do not allow anyone to pitch an idea that they will not be working on at the event, unless there really are not enough ideas to go around. Otherwise, this is a waste of everyone’s valuable time.

Once hacking has begun, do not interrupt the hackers *except* to ensure that the hacking is going smoothly, to check that everyone has something to do, and to keep people on the overall schedule. Mid-day activities such as lunch-time speakers and video calls with people off-site are incredibly distracting for participants who are now eager to get working on a problem.

# Training

A successful hackathon might be just hacking, just training, or both hacking and training.

If you have a significant number of newcomers, having training workshops is a great way to give them something to do that they will be more comfortable with than diving into hacking. You can run workshops to introduce participants to the subject of the hackathon or to particular technical skills useful for the hackathon. Workshops can also be places to have a discussion about issues in the field related to the hackathon. Workshops should be interactive as much as possible

Choose your workshop leaders carefully. Ideally the leaders have run the same workshop before so they are well rehearsed. They should also be as diverse as the attendees you would like to see present at the event (gender, race, age, etc.). Read the [Hopper Conference Diversity Guide](http://conference.hopper.org.nz/#speakers)’s tips on selecting speakers.

Run the workshops in a second room if at all possible. 45-90 minute workshops are a good length. If you have more than one workshop, leave 15-30 minutes free between workshops to allow for the first leader to close up and the second leader to set up.

At Open Data Day DC, we have run six workshops over two days on an introduction to open data and APIs, an introduction to collaboration using github, open mapping, an introduction to Python, and community engagement.

# Venue & date

# Basic requirements

Find a venue to host your event and reserve the date. This is the only thing you need to do significantly in advance of the event. The earlier you can reserve space the better.

Find a venue that can provide:

* Proper seating (see below)
* One power strip per table
* Wifi (is it fast and reliable? can it connect all of your participants? does it block any ports?)
* Projector
* A microphone, at least in large rooms
* Accessible entrances and wheelchair-friendly seating space (and if there is a stage, check if it is accessible, if applicable)
* Gender-neutral, single-occupancy, accessible bathrooms

(If you are running a large event, also read through [all of the accessibility concerns listed here](http://conference.hopper.org.nz/#environment).)

# Seating

Seating requirements are different for hacking and workshops. For hacking, you will want a banquet-style setup with large circular tables that seat about 10 people each. Rooms in banquet-setup hold the *fewest* number of people compared to other table/chair arrangements, so take that into account when computing capacity. For workshops you will want classroom-style seating, i.e. rectangular tables with chairs on one side.

# When

Choose the date of your event carefully. Avoid the summer, holidays, and other major events in your field. Weekends are hard for people who are attending in their professional capacity. Weeknights are hard for parents.

Ask your venue about permissible start and end times. Set times for when you will arrive/leave and for when participants will arrive/leave. Plan at least 30 minutes before and after the event for you to set up and tear-down/cleanup.

Make sure you can get in and that your participants can get in. If the building’s front door is locked, make sure you have a key and that you have someone posted at the door to let in participants (you may need a team of people to rotate at the front door throughout the day).

# Also check...

Check whether the venue permits you to have food in the room.

If holding the event outside of business hours, check that the venue will have air conditioning/heating.

# Budgeting your venue

Professional venues charge quite a bit of money, so you will need to find something that fits your budget. Hopefully you can find some free space with good wifi (your local library, a friend’s company, etc.).

For a large, one-full-day event in a major city, expect venues to change in the thousands of dollars per day. It depends on how much space you need, and there is no rhyme or reason to pricing, but it usually comes out to about $10-$30 per person.

# Sponsorship

For large events, you will probably need sponsors to help you cover the costs.

Sponsors will give you something — cash, space, food, t-shirts — with the expectation that they get something out of their support for your event. They might be recruiting/hiring and are looking to scout out your attendees, or they might be marketing a product that they want to promote.

Think about what you’re willing to give sponsors in return for their support. You will certainly thank your sponsors, by name, during your opening and closing session, and you will probably want to tweet your thanks too. Beyond that, do you want to give them a time at a podium to speak to your attendees? Or a table in the back to show off their stuff? It’s up to you, and you have to strike the right balance between bringing in enough sponsorships with not interfering with the goals of your event.

Figure out your budget — your venue and food costs, especially — first, so you know how much in sponsorships you need. But then get started on securing sponsors early.

# Food

Ideally you should provide coffee and light fare for breakfast and beverages throughout the day (especially water). Food is surprisingly expensive though, so do what you can.

# What to buy

If you provide any food, you really *must* supply vegetarian and dairy-free options because these dietary restrictions are very common. Going all-vegetarian isn’t a bad idea. After that, give consideration to other restrictions your participants may have (vegan, kosher, gluten-free) and do your best.

Be responsible with your food. Think like a parent. Order food that is relatively healthy. Avoid heavy foods that make people sleepy (like bread) or ineffective (like alcohol). Caffeine and sugar are fine (energy is important), but have real nourishment too..

# Budgeting and logistics

Figure on $7 to $15 per person. Pizza is the cheapest food to get, but it’s also basically the worst thing you can possibly feed someone (and not everyone eats it) — avoid pizza if you can.

If you are ordering food, you will probably place the order at least three days ahead of the event.

# Swag

Some events like to provide swag, like t-shirts or stickers. Personally I think there are much better ways to spend your budget, but if you really want to provide swag keep in mind–

Don’t get one-size-fits-all t-shirts because people aren’t all alike. In fact, read [Hopper Conference Diversity Guide’s section on t-shirts](http://conference.hopper.org.nz/#tshirts).

# Code of conduct

Technology events have a history of not always being welcoming to women and minorities. We need to change that. You can be a part of that change by adopting a code of conduct for the event. A code of conduct is not just about enforcing rules. It sets community norms and sends a signal to would-be participants that you are trying to create a welcoming environment. And, of course, if there is a problem at your event having a code of conduct ahead of time will help you resolve the issue.

Look for codes of conduct used at events you admire, or copy from [Code for DC’s code of conduct](http://codefordc.org/resources/codeofconduct.html) or [Tech Lady Hackathon + Training Day’s code of conduct](http://techladyhackathon.org/codeofconduct). Also read the [Hopper Conference Diversity Guide](http://conference.hopper.org.nz/#coc)’s section on this.

# Happy hours

A pre-event happy hour the night before helps participants to get to know each other in a relaxing setting. A post-event happy hour the evening after the hackathon wraps up gives participants a chance to socialize now that they know each other.

For large events, pick a bar ahead of time and talk to the bar and make sure it is ok for you to bring a large group. You may want to reserve a section of the bar (they may ask for a payment ahead of time or a guaranteed minimum spend that they will charge you after if your people don’t order enough).

If you are serving alcohol keep in mind: not everyone drinks (those under 21, pregnant women, and many many other people for a variety of reasons); alcohol can lead to an unsafe or uncomfortable environment; those that drink will need public transportation to get home. So therefore: provide non-alcoholic drinks; supervise the environment to ensure it remains professional and comfortable for all; be near public transit.

# Registration

Set up an [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) registration form.

# Registration Limit

Determine your maximum capacity. For an event with parallel tracks, bear in mind that participants will all gather in one room at the start of the event, so your maximum capacity is a little larger than the capacity of your main room (some people can squeeze/stand at the beginning).

For a free event, about 65% of those who register will actually show up. This number is very consistently seen across events. So cap registration at 150% of your actual maximum capacity.

# Gather info

Use the registration form to gather information about participants:

* Name (and possibly other information as required by venue security)
* Email address
* Job title
* Are they new to hackathons?
* What kind of hacker are they? Examples: Developer. Designer. Data Scientist. Domain Expert. Government Staff. Communicator. Project Manager. Advocate.
* What are they interested in hacking on? (free form question)
* Are they interested in any of the workshops?
* How they heard about the event
* Special needs/requests

The more information you can gather ahead of time the better planning you can do. You can start to think about who will be working on what as soon as registrations start coming. Literally try to imagine how each registered participant will keep occupied at the event based on whatever information you know about them.

# Ten days before

# Find project leaders

Look at who is coming and if you know some of those people are coming with particular projects, identify project leaders. You may also want to meet with them at this time to:

* Guide them on how to make progress on their projects
* Identify how they can take on newcomers, what tasks are doable for newcomers
* Identify what sort of help their project needs

See the section Cultivating Good Projects above.

# Find helpers

If you are running interactive workshops where the participants are following along on their laptops and expect many participants to attend, you may want to have workshop helpers around to help participants that get stuck. Plan for at least one helper for every 10-20 participants.

Also find helpers to run a registration table and the building’s front door if it is locked, and you can also consider identifying volunteers to take point on photography, managing social media, and documenting what happens at the event for storytelling afterward.

# Email attendees

You may want to email the registered attendees at this point with as much of the logistics information as you know, so that they can plan ahead. See “The day before” below for what to include in the email.

# Three days before

# Set up group communication

Set up a way for your participants to communicate digitally and stay in touch after the event. Some options are:

* A chat room, like [Slack](https://slack.com/)
* A social media channel, like a hashtag on Twitter or a Facebook group
* A shared document space, like Google Docs or [Dropbox Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/paper)
* An email list, like a Google Group

# Think about how you will tell your story

Part of your event’s lasting impact is in how people will remember it:

* Choose a hashtag.
* Set up a [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) or other public shared document space (see above) for projects to record progress and post links.
* Think about [how to take photos of your hackathon](http://paulclarke.com/photography/blog/the-hack-day/) that tell its story.
* Read Nathan Matias and Willow Brugh’s [media-making strategies](https://civic.mit.edu/blog/natematias/media-making-strategies-to-support-community-and-learning-at-hackathons) for hackathons.

# Acquire supplies

You should bring to the event:

* Paper, markers, and tape to write and post signs with
* Name tag stickers and markers for people to write their names on their name tag
* Note cards, pens, paper and other supplies to facilitate project planning
* Plastic cups, paper plates, and disposable utensils if you are providing food

# Also...

* Place any food catering orders
* Email any journalists you know who may be interested in the event
* Charge your camera so you are ready to take photos
* Some venues require a list of participants for security. If you need to submit a list, make sure you alphabetize it! Security will probably print whatever you have as-is and things get complicated quickly when the list is not in order.

# Email attendees again

You may want to email the registered attendees at this point, again, with as much of the logistics information as you know, so that they can plan ahead. See “The day before” below for what to include in the email.

# The day before

# Walk-through

Do a walk-through of your venue. Ensure you have:

* Banquet tables for hacking, rectangular tables for workshops
* Enough chairs (count them!)
* One power strip per table
* Working WiFi
* Working projector and VGA dongle (maybe even test your computer)
* A microphone, at least in large rooms

If you have two parallel tracks:

* Go over the list above once for the hacking room and again for the training room
* Ensure you have enough space to hold everyone in one room because participants will gather in one room first for the welcoming session

# Email blast

Send out a logistics email to registered participants. Include:

* Your contact information, including your cell phone number so participants can call/text you if they cannot find the venue
* Any pre-event and post-event happy hour information: location, date, and time
* Start and end dates and times of the event
* Location of the event (address and building name), exact location of entrance, directions, and map
* Reminder to bring ID if the venue has a security check-in
* Reminder to bring a laptop and charger
* What food/beverages will be provided and when (breakfast, lunch, dinner?), and what restrictions will be accommodated (vegetarian, etc.)
* Schedule of workshops, if applicable
* Your code of conduct (or a link)
* If there are any disability accessibility issues with the venue, include that
* Any read-ahead materials to prepare them for the topic of the event
* Names of the organizers and acknowledgement/thanks to sponsors

# Handouts

Print handouts for participants that include:

* WiFi info (SSID and password)
* The event’s hashtag and URL
* The schedule (start time, lunch, end time, and workshop schedule if applicable)
* A list of breakout rooms
* Recommend nearby locations for lunch/dinner (and include a map if possible)
* A short URL (e.g. bitly) to the tumblr or hackpad page

Print one copy per table (i.e. one copy for every \~5-10 participants).

# Also

* Prepare slides for the welcoming session (if you want)
* Charge your phone. It is going to be a long day tomorrow.

# Hackathon schedule

# When you arrive early

* Make sure things are OK: tables/chairs are there, the projector works, restrooms are in working order
* Post signs from the main entrance of the building to where participants should go first
* Post signs to restrooms and any other rooms participants may need to go to
* Lay out the name badges. If they are printed with names, lay them out alphabetically and if there are a lot group them by part of the alphabet and post signs.

# Welcoming session

Start with a brief session welcoming everyone and laying out the day:

* Introduce the organizers
* Thank the venue and sponsors (do not forget anyone — *this* is why they sponsored you)
* Explain the history and purpose of the event
* Mention the code of conduct (again, the point is often to set norms, not merely to enforce rules)
* Ask who has not been to a hackathon before, or to your particular event before; give an applause
* Explain logistics: the Tumblr, the schedule of workshops, lunch, end time
* Encourage people to take and share session notes and to record progress on projects (see the notes above on telling the hackathon’s story)

In a small event (up to about 30 people), you can have all of the participants introduce themselves.

Anyone who has brought a project to work on should then introduce the project to everyone. This is sometimes called “project pitches.” Keep each pitch short: the leader’s name and affiliation, a problem statement, the solution, and the skills/help needed. Project leaders tend to talk for as long as they can, so you may need to cut them off after one minute to be respectful of the audience’s time. Encourage leaders to think of this not as recruiting but as boasting how awesome their day is going to be.

# During the day

Have someone managing the hacking room. Go around to check that every project is going smoothly. See if anyone needs anything or can’t find something to work on. Keep people on the overall schedule. Alert everyone when it is time for lunch and one hour before the wrap-up session. Leading up to wrap-up, make sure each project is prepared to explain what they did. Get them to record their progress on the tumblr.

Have someone managing workshops. Make sure workshops stay on schedule, that participants are understanding the leader, can hear the leader from the back of the room, etc. Be around to ensure that the workshop leader doesn’t have any technology problems. An organizer should be on hand at the workshops at all times.

# Wrap-up

The wrap-up session gives everyone a chance to hear what everyone else worked on during the day. For a small group, ask volunteers to report what they accomplished or what they learned (especially for workshop participants). Give folks rounds of applause.

In large groups, have each project report on its accomplishments. If possible, let them show their work on the projector. But keep things quick. By this point projects may have a lot to say. Keep each project to 1 or 2 minutes, and if they are going to show something on the projector make sure it is ready before the wrap-up session begins.

Finally:

* Thank the venue and sponsors
* Thank the attendees and co-organizers
* If there is a post-event, direct people to it or ask a volunteer to lead people over

# Tear-down

Finally once all of the participants are gone, make sure the venue is returned to its original state:

* Clean up
* Remove signs
* Check for lost items

# Post-mortem

After the event:

* Write down everything that went right so you can repeat it next time
* Write down everything that went wrong so you can avoid it next time
* Compute how much the event cost in total and per participant, just to know
* Survey the attendees about what they liked and didn’t like
* Blog about the event

You already know

Yes. Right? We started off bad, we had relations before marriage, you got pregnant, it started off bad. I'm just commenting that is starting off bad and you get upset just because I comment something. 

That's not what you commented

Then? I just wanted to know did she get with the guy or marry him

No that's not what you said either

Or what happened to the dad?

No, that wasn't what you said

I just want to know then what happened to the dad

Oh my goodness... well you didn't ask that

Okay I'm asking

Well, that's still not the only thing you said and not the reason I got upset so don't say that's all it was

1lsne3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lsne3m/im_being_followed_by_a_truck_thats_full_of_people/,I'm being followed by a truck that's full of people. There's a surgery going on in the cargo hold. I can see it through the glass.,"*“What am I even looking at, here…”* I whispered to myself.

The soft clicking of my sedan’s turn signal chirped in my ear, and my fingers tapped against the steering wheel with an impatient rhythm. I turned away and attempted to keep my eyes fixed forward. Despite my best efforts,  though, I found my gaze drifting from the reddish glow of the stoplight to the reddish glow emanating from the truck.

My eyes narrowed as I scanned the enormous glass cargo hold, struggling to imagine what the purpose of such of thing could even be. There was movement inside of it, too. Some internal light fixture illuminated the people walking about the truck bed.

Initially, I couldn’t tell what they were doing.

A red curtain draped against the inside of the glass obscured my view.

Multiple human-shaped shadows flickered behind the curtain, pacing up and down the length of the eighteen-wheeler like a group of anxiety-riddled stagehands preparing for act one of a play on opening night.

Obviously, the thought was absurd. It was 3:53 in the morning. Main Street was appropriately deserted. Just me and the truck; no other vehicles in sight.

Who the hell would they even be performing for?

Icy sweat beaded on my forehead. I cranked the A/C to its highest setting. Some combination of exhaustion from my night shift and the uncanny sight was making my heart palpitate.

Then, they pulled back the curtain.

It was a devastatingly familiar scene. My breath came out in ragged gasps. Hot nausea creeped up the back of throat.

The shining steel table. Honeycombed overhead lights like monstrous bug-eyes. Drills. Scalpels. Monitors with video feeds displaying the table from every conceivable angle. Away from the table, a flock of subordinates, attired in sterile gowns and powdered gloves, remained still.

They waited for their leader’s command.

He was impossibly tall, hunching slightly forward to prevent his head from grazing the top of the hollow container. As if to further delineate his rank, the leader’s smock was leathery and skin toned; everyone else’s was white and cleanly pressed. Between the mask covering his mouth and the glare from the light affixed to his glasses, I couldn’t see his face.

He lumbered toward the table, fingers wrapped around the handles of a wheelchair.

The person in the wheelchair was unconscious. A young man with a mop of frizzy brown hair, naked as the day he was born. His head was dead weight, rolling across his chest he creaked forward, inch by tortuous inch.

Despite his rag-doll body, I knew his awake. Even if I couldn’t see them, I knew there was life in his eyes.

He just couldn’t move his body.

Still, they were going to perform a surgery on the poor sap.

I looked away. The traffic light was still red. I glanced at the clock.

*4:01AM*.

Without a second thought, my boot crashed onto the accelerator. I sped down Main Street. The truck became smaller and smaller in my rear-view mirror until it was just a dot of light on the horizon.

A wave of relief swept down my spine, but an intrusive thought soured my respite.

*They’ve likely started operating, and he can feel everything. The ripping of skin. The oozing of blood. His nerves are screaming.*

*He just can’t say anything.*

\- - - - - 

*“…I’m sorry Pete, run that by me again? What was so wrong with the truck?”* James asked, rubbing his temple like he had a migraine coming on.

I tore off a sheet from a nearby paper towel roll and reached over our kitchen island.

*“You’re dripping again, bud,”* I remarked.

James cocked his head at me, then looked to the wipe. He couldn’t feel the mucus dripping from the corner of his right eye, apparently. It took a few seconds for him to process the statement.

Recognition flashed across his face.

*“Oh! Shoot.”*

He grabbed the paper towel and blotted away the gelatinous teardrop - a side effect from the LASIK procedure that he had underwent a month prior.

Overall, I agreed with him: James looked better without glasses. That said, if attention from the opposite sex was the name of the game, the persistent ocular discharge that he now suffered from seemed like a bit of monkey’s paw. One step forward, two steps back.

He didn’t seem overly preoccupied with the issue.

As he crumpled the paper towel, I tried explaining what’d happened the night before. For the third time.

*“I’m driving home from a shift, idling at a stoplight, and this truck pulls up beside me. One of those big motherfuckers. Cargo hold the size of our apartment, monster-truck wheels - you get the idea. But the cargo hold, it’s this huge glass box. There’s a curtain on the inside, like they were about to debut a mobile rendition of Hamlet. But they - the people inside of the box, I forgot to mention the people - they weren’t about to perform a play. I mean, I don’t know for sure that they weren’t, but that’s besides the point. They looked like they were going to…and I know how this sounds…but they looked like they were going to perform surgery…”*

My recollection of the event crumbled. I was losing the plot. Found myself distracted by James.

Now, both sides were leaking.

I ripped another piece of paper towel off the roll and handed it to him. He was watching me, but his expression was vacant. The lights were on behind his eyes, but nobody seemed to be home. I started to wonder if he’d discontinued his ADHD meds or something.

After an uncomfortable pause, he realized *why* I was giving him more tissue paper.

*“So, what was so wrong with the truck?”* he repeated, once again blotting the tears away.

\- - - - - 

About a week passed before I saw the truck again.

That time, it was all happening in broad daylight.

I rounded a corner onto Main Street and parked my car in front of our local coffee shop, pining for my afternoon bolus of caffeine to prepare for another grueling night shift.

As I placed my hand over the cafe’s doorknob, I heard a familiar jingling noise behind me. The rattling of change against the inside of a plastic cup. A pang of guilt curled around my heart like a hungry python.

I’d walked past Danny like he didn’t even exist.

I flipped around, digging through my pockets for a few loose bills.

*“Sorry about that, bud. Can’t seem to find the way out of my own head today.”*

Danny smiled, revealing a mouth only half-filled with teeth.

I’d known him for as long as I’d lived in town, give or take two years. Didn’t know much *about* him, though. I wasn’t aware why he was homeless, nor was I clued in as to why he never spoke. Say what you want about Danny, but it’s hard to deny that the man was a curiosity. He didn’t fit nicely into any particular archetype, I suppose. His beard was wild and his dentition was a nightmare, but the odd camo-colored jumpsuits he sported never smelled too bad. He was mute, but he didn’t appear to have any other severe mental health issues. No obvious ones, anyway. He always appeared content even though he lived on the street, begging for change.

A man of inherent contradictions, silently loitering on a bench in front of the cafe, day in and day out. I liked him. There was something hopeful lingering behind his existence. Gave him what I had to spare when I went for coffee most days.

As I dropped the crumpled five-dollar bill into his cup, I saw it passing behind him.

The truck was moving about fifteen miles an hour, but that did not seem to bother them. The leader didn’t struggle to keep his balance as he toiled away, both hands inside his patient. The table and the tools and the crash cart didn’t shift around from the momentum.

It was difficult to determine *exactly* what procedure they were performing. The monitors and their video feeds were pointed towards the operation, yes, but they were so zoomed in that it was nearly impossible to orient myself to what I was seeing: an incomprehensible mess of gleaming viscera, soggy, red, and pulsing.

Best guess? They were rooting around in someone’s abdomen.

Now, I’m a pretty reserved person. My ex-wife described me as *conflict-avoidant* to our marriage counselor. But the raw surprise of seeing that truck and the accompanying gore broke my normal pattern of behavior. Really lit a fire under my ass.

*“Hey! What the hell do you all think you’re doin’? There’s an elementary school a block over, for Christ’s sake!”* I shouted, jogging after the truck.

With its hazard lights flashing, the vehicle started to pull over to the side of the road. I had almost caught up to it when I heard the pounding of fast, heavy footsteps behind me.

Danny slowed his pace, wrapped his arm around my shoulders, and began *speaking*. His voice was low and raspy, like his vocal cords were fighting to make sound through a thick layer of rust. He didn’t really *say* anything, either. Or, more accurately, what he was saying had no meaning.

*“Well..yes..and…you see that…”* - on and on and on.

In retrospect, I realize that wasn’t the point. Danny wasn’t talking to relay a message. No, he was just *pretending* to be embroiled in conversation, and he wanted me to play along. With his arm wrapped around my shoulder, he forcefully pushed my cheek with his fingers, turning my head so my eyes would face him, and not the truck.

I didn’t intend to play along. I was still fuming about the gruesome display, aiming to give the perpetrators a piece of my mind. But the entire sequence of events was so disarmingly strange that my brain just ended up short-circuiting.

So, I played along.

The look of raw dread behind Danny’s eyes convinced me to help maintain the charade of a conversation, even if I didn’t understand why it was so important. I suppressed my anger and walked alongside him until we reached the nearest alleyway. He started turning into it, so I followed suit.

I caught a glimpse of the parked truck as we pivoted.

They were no longer operating. Instead, they were all clustered in a corner, staring intently at us, the leader’s skin-toned smock and gaunt body towering above the rest of the group.

As soon as we were out of view, Danny dropped the act. He doubled over, hyperventilating, hand pushed into the brick of the adjacent building to keep him from falling over completely.

*“What the fuck is going on?”* I whispered.

The man’s breathing began to regulate. My voice grew louder.

*“What the hell kind of surgery are they doing in there?”*

Danny shot up and put a finger to his lips to shush me. I acquiesced. Stayed silent and waited. Once it was clear that I wasn’t going to start yelling at him again, he pulled the five-dollar bill I’d just given him from one pocket and a cheap ballpoint pen from the other. The man rolled the bill against the brick wall and furiously scribbled a message. He then folded it neatly, placed it on his palm, and offered it to me.

Reluctantly, I took the money back.

He muttered the word “*sorry*” and then ran further into the alleyway. I didn’t give chase.

Instead, I uncrumpled the bill and read his message. Danny’s erratic handwriting conveyed a series of fragmented warnings:

*“It looks different for everyone.”*

*“If you react, they can tell you’re uninhabited.”*

*“Once they’re sure, that’s when they take you.”*

*“They chose brown for their larvae - brown is the most common.”*

*“You need to leave town tonight.”*


\- - - - - 

The next afternoon, I discovered Danny’s usual bench concerningly unoccupied.

But the truck was there. Parked right outside the cafe.

New patient, new surgery.

I trusted Danny was on to something, but I didn’t heed his advice and leave town.

Not right away.

It was nearly impossible to *pretend* they weren’t there, especially once they started driving around my neighborhood at night. I could faintly hear the whirring of drills above the grumbling engine, intermittently passing by my bedroom window.

They didn’t just plant themselves right outside my front door, thankfully. They still did their rounds, their “patrol”, but it felt like they’d taken a special interest in me. Maybe I was a unique case to them. They weren’t *completely* confident I could see them. I’m sure it was pretty cut and dry most of the time. Danny’s intervention had put me in a nebulous middle ground. Maybe I did see them that day. Or maybe I was just having a heated conversation with Danny. 

Thus, they increased the pressure.

Either I’d crack, or I wouldn’t.

I came pretty close.

You see, it wasn’t just the sheer absurdity of it all that was getting to me. The stimuli felt targeted. Catered to my very specific set of traumas. I suppose that probably yields the best results.

Which brings me to this:

Have you ever heard of a condition called *Anesthesia Awareness?*

It’s the fancy name for the concept of maintaining consciousness during a surgery, instead of falling asleep. All things considered, it’s a fairly common phenomenon: one for every fifteen thousand operations or so.

For most, it’s only a blip. A fleeting lucidity. A quick flash of awareness, and then they’re back under.

For most, it’s painless. Even without pain, it’s still pretty terrifying. Paralytics are a devilish breed of pharmacology. Complete and utter muscular shutdown without touching the brain’s ability to think and perceive. Immurement within the confines of your own flesh. To me, there isn’t a purer vision of hell.

That said, I’m fairly biased. Because I’m not like most.

I was awake for the entirety of my appendectomy, and I felt every single thing. Sure, they saved my life. I was on death’s door. My appendix detonated like a grenade inside my abdominal cavity.

But I mean, at what cost?

The first incision was the worst. I won’t bother describing the pain. The sensation was immeasurable. Completely off the scale.

And I couldn’t do a goddamn thing about it.

They dug around in my torso for nearly two hours. Exhuming the infected appendix and cleaning up the damage it’d already done. Cauterizing my bleeding intestines. 

I *sort of* accumulated to the pain. I never accumulated to the smell.

About half-way through, I even managed to kick my foot. Just once, and it wasn’t much. It’d taken nuclear levels of energy and willpower to manifest that tiny movement through the effects of the paralytic.

A nurse mentioned the kick to the surgeon. Want to know what he said in response?

*“Noted.”*

I’ve been hoping the truck would give up at some point and just move on. It wasn’t a great plan, but I didn’t exactly have the money to skip town and start a life somewhere else.

What transpired this afternoon changed my opinion on the matter.

When I stopped by the coffee shop, the truck was there, per my new normal. I’d considered completely altering my routine to avoid them, but if the safest thing to do was to pretend they weren’t there, wouldn’t that be suspicious?

As I was walking out with my drink, doing my absolute damndest to act casual, I saw who was on the operating table today.

It may not have *actually* been him, of course. It could have just been an escalation on their part. A sharper piece of stimuli in order to finally illicit a reaction from me.

To their credit, witnessing Danny being cut into did make me flinch. I’m not sure how obvious it was.

When I got back to my sedan, I didn’t head to work. I returned home to retrieve a couple of necessities; primarily, family photos and my revolver. Wanted to say goodbye to James as well.

He wasn’t expecting me home so soon.

*They* weren’t expecting me home so soon.

I threw open the front door to our apartment, and there he was: propped up on the couch, motionless, trails of mucus across his cheeks, all the way down to the collar of his shirt.

Eyeless.

No blood anywhere.

I heard them before I saw them.

They emit this deep, gurgling sound when threatened. It’s not loud, but it’s hard to miss.

Then, one came into view. Guess it’d been scaling the back of the couch when I walked in.

Honestly, it resembled an oversized caterpillar: pale, segmented, scrunching its body as it moved - but it was as big as a sausage link. Its tail was distinctive, tapering off like a wasp’s belly until the very end, at which point it abruptly expanded and became spherical with colored markings. 

From behind, it looked like an eyeball with a hazel-colored iris.

Danny called them *larvae*. I suppose that’s a good fit. I’m assuming they can’t communicate with their hive mind until they're fully grown, otherwise, why wouldn’t James have alerted them to my lack of inhabitation?

Initially, I thought it was crawling back *into* James, head first into his eye socket so its tail could snuggly lay where his eye should have been.

It completely passed him by, though. Slithered down from the couch and onto the floor.

The larva was crawling towards me, I think.

I didn’t stick around to find out.

\- - - - - 

Honestly, I’m starting to believe most people are already inhabited.

For those among you who aren’t, I don’t know what the inside of the truck will look like when it gets to you, but it’ll be something that’s designed to get your attention.

Your best bet is to not respond.

Be like me on the operating table.

No matter how terrible it is, no matter how painful it feels, no matter how loud your body screams for you to intervene:

1lsndz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Grim_stories/comments/1lsndz8/the_scarecrows_watch/,The Scarecrow’s Watch,"My name’s Ben, and I was fifteen the summer I stayed with my grandparents.

Mom said it would be “good for me.” A break from the city life. Somewhere quiet after Dad died in that car crash. I didn’t argue. What was there to argue about anymore?

Their house sat on a couple dozen acres in rural North Carolina, surrounded by woods and with a massive cornfield that buzzed with cicadas day and night. My grandfather, Grady, still worked the land, even though he was in his seventies. Grandma June mostly stayed in the house, baking, knitting, and watching old TV shows on a television twice my age.

They were kind, but strange. Grady never smiled, and Grandma’s eyes always seemed to be looking at something just over your shoulder. The cornfield was their pride and joy. Tall stalks, thick rows, perfectly maintained. And right in the middle stood the scarecrow. I saw it on the first day I arrived.

It was too tall (like seven feet) and its limbs were wrong. Thin and knotted like old tree branches you’d see in rain forest videos. It wore a faded flannel shirt and a burlap sack over its head, stitched in a crude smile. I don’t know what it was but something about it made my skin crawl. When I asked about it, Grandma just said, “It keeps the birds out. Don’t want them crows eating our corn Benny.”

Grady didn’t answer at all.

But at night, I’d hear things. Rustling from the field. Thuds. Low groans, like someone dragging a heavy sack over dry ground. I convinced myself it was wind. Or raccoons. Or just being away from home, messing with my head. I just wasn’t use to the quiet at night. I was hearing things I never would or could in the city.

Until the fifth  night.

I woke up thirsty and walked past the kitchen window to get a glass of water. That’s when I saw it. The scarecrow wasn’t where it should’ve been. Now it was closer to the house.

It had moved. I blinked. Rubbed my eyes. But there it stood, just at the edge of the field now. Still. Watching.

I told Grady the next morning. He just looked up from his coffee and said, “Don’t go into the corn. Not unless you want to take its place.”

I laughed nervously, thinking it was a joke. He didn’t laugh back.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. So I did what every dumb kid in your classic Hollywood horror story does. I grabbed a flashlight and went into the field.

The corn was thick, and hard to move through. Every rustle made me flinch. I turned in circles, trying to find the scarecrow.

The corn stocks rustled just off to my left. I froze in place. My heart thudded in my chest like a jackhammer. I peeked a few rows over and there it was. I couldn’t believe my eyes. It was… Walking.

Its feet dragged in the dirt, but it was moving, limbs twitching, head tilted unnaturally to one side. It stopped a few rows away from me, as if it knew I was there.

I didn’t scream. Hell, I couldn’t. I just turned and ran, crashing through stalks, until I saw the porch light. Grady stood outside, shotgun in hand.

“You went into the corn, didn’t you!?” he said, not angry. Just…

Behind me, I heard the rows rustle.

“You better get inside now,” he yelled. “It’s seen you!”",1,1751758884.0,Grim_stories,0,1.0,False

1lsnc3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lsnc3e/heart_palpitations_after_quitting_ssri/,Heart palpitations after quitting SSRI,"I've posted this topic a few times before, but I just need reassurance I'm not dying.

Okay so I'm stupid and cold turkey citalopram on 5mg about 6 weeks ago - told my doctor and she didn't seem concerned since side effects were minor. 2 weeks after I did quit I started getting heart palpitations, like 50-100 daily. As of last week I was getting better like maybe no more than 10 a day.

Now all of a sudden it's spiked and today I had what felt like 100+. I had a coffee today and I'm wondering if thats why it made it worse. Like it was super bad 30 mins after I drank a lot of it and has been beginning to settle down but still bad (8 hours after). 

When I started getting these symptoms I did tell my doctor and she had an EKG done, nothing is wrong according to it. I also had blood work done, again nothing wrong. I'm going in again in about 2 weeks to ask for a holter monitor test just in case but I'm positive it's the withdrawal.

The heart palpations are the only symptoms I'm having of the SSRI withdrawal and it sucks. Im constantly panicking and anxious because of it, thinking it's a heart attack or heart failure and then it makes it worse, but I'm trying my best to stay calm

If the holter monitor test comes back fine and nothing concerning, should I go back on my SSRI if the heart palpitions are too much for me? Like I've read some people have them for months or over a year. Will it make the heart palpitations better? Is it normal for it to spike again after it was getting better?

Again, I have no other symptoms that could be heart problem related and this has been going on for 4 weeks or so.",1,1751758729.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

For 3 years, Evelyn combed every shoreline near Deadwood Bay. Her husband, Mason, had gone missing during what was supposed to be a simple weekend fishing trip. His boat was found adrift, tackle scattered, a beer can bobbing beside it. No sign of struggle, no trace of him. Just gone.

Mason had been a hard man—hard drinker, hard fists, hard to love. But Evelyn, raised on the gospel of loyalty and second chances, stayed. She wore long sleeves in summer and forgave what others begged her to flee. His disappearance left her confused more than relieved.

Grief came in waves. Sometimes guilt. Sometimes freedom. But always the aching absence of closure.

Then, just as quietly as he left, he returned.

It was late evening, the sky bleeding orange behind the hills, when Evelyn saw him standing at the edge of the driveway. Same weathered jacket, same steel-toe boots. But there was something… off.

He smiled. Mason never smiled like that.

He stepped into the house like a man who had never left. Kissed her cheek softly. Asked about the garden. Evelyn stood frozen, clutching the hem of her apron.

He never once asked for a beer.

Over the next few days, Evelyn watched him. He cleaned up after himself. Spoke gently. Slept soundly. No swearing at the TV, no late-night rages, no smell of whiskey on his breath. He read books. He said “please.” Once, he offered to cook dinner and made rosemary chicken.

The man wore her husband’s skin, but not his shadow.

“You feel different,” she said one night, gripping her mug tight. “Like you were… remade.”

He looked at her for a long moment. Then said, “I think I was.”

That night, she snuck out to the shed and dug through his old tackle box. Inside, beneath rusted lures and tangled line, she found something she hadn’t expected—his old wedding ring, scratched and dulled. He was still wearing a ring. But this one looked brand new.

The next day, she drove into town and asked around. The sheriff shrugged. “Walked in like he owned the place. No ID, no explanation. Just said he was back.”

So she asked him. Straight out.

“What happened out there on the water?”

He stirred his tea and said, “I drowned.”

Silence.

“I remember the cold pulling me down, something wrapping around my leg… Then I woke up on a shore I’d never seen before. There were people—things—there. They fixed me. Said I had potential. That I could be better. That the old me was… broken.”

He met her eyes, and for the first time, she saw something beneath his calm—fear.

“I think they kept a part of me. And maybe… gave me something else in return.”

Evelyn stood slowly, her skin crawling. “You’re not Mason.”

“I’m what he could have been,” he whispered.

She didn’t run. She didn’t scream. She just nodded and left the room. That night, she didn’t sleep.

In the morning, she made two cups of coffee. One black, one with cream and sugar. She placed the sugared one before him.

He sipped it without comment.

Mason hated sugar in his coffee.

She stared at the man across the table and smiled faintly.

Whoever—or whatever—he was, she wasn’t sure if she wanted the real Mason back anymore.",11,1751758502.0,scarystories,3,0.92,False

1lsn5nh,https://i.redd.it/r40xlakv25bf1.png,[OC] Chili and Lampent,"This time I drew one of the Striaton triplets Chili and the eerie ghostly Lampent!

The quality that I like the most from Chili is his fiery passion, although I relate to his impetuousness and recklessness much more. I am often described by my family, friends and colleagues by these 2 adjectives. I also appreciated that in one of the anime episodes, he strove for improving himself and tap into his anger as a source of strength. 

Also I drew Chili serving a G-max-Alcremie-inspired cake, because why not? This character is inspired by cafe/coffee shop waiter/server to an extent, and I could imagine Chili saying something like 'Can I interest you in our dessert menu?' and 'Our Alcremie cake is a must try.' haha

Meanwhile, the Litwick-Lampent-Chandelure evolution line is one of my favourites because of design. I like the fact that their inspirations are run-of-the-mill inanimate objects (e.g. streetlight for Lampent). Also, I would like to add a little bit unexpectedness in terms of sync pairing because in the mainstream game / anime, Chili is paired with only animal-inspired Pokemon(s) like Pansear/Simisear. 

Chili and his brothers were featured in the animated PMEX trailer at the beginning, therefore I originally expected they would debuted like 5-6 ago but they are still in NPC jail. Hopefully they could be free from the NPC jail one day lol

1lsn5i8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lsn5i8/ive_always_been_here/,I've always been here,"My name was Diana. I'd like to share my story here because I know many of you are believers of things that most would never think twice about. I don't know where I go from here or what I truly am. I am terrified of what this means for you all. I'm getting ahead of myself. I'm sorry. This is my story, I'll start at the beginning.

The first voicemail came at 3:12 am. I didn't even hear the phone ring.

The number was completely unfamiliar, unlisted and when I checked it was also untraceable. I sat down on my bed and listened to it, thinking maybe it was a mistake. Maybe a grieving mother or some drunk lonely man. The voice on the other end was eerily calm. Measured even. It was familiar in a way that made the hair on the back of my neck stand at attention. 

""Hey. It's okay. Just wanted to let you know that we're ready. We're safe now. You did so good. You can come back.""

The voice on the other end paused.

""We miss you"". Click.

I sat for a long time with my phone in hand, replaying the message. The voice was like something out of a dream. Like it was just known but couldn't be placed but you recognize it in your bones. She said my name. Not Diana or Ana. The way my mother used to call me when she needed to talk, to hear my voice. She had the exact cadence. Like she knew exactly who I was.

And even stranger still for a woman that doesn't cry, I couldn't help the strangled sob that escaped my lips.

I cried myself to sleep and when I woke the next morning I wrote it off as a prank. Someone had just got a lucky guess, maybe a friend doing too much.

I couldn't shake the way it made me feel. Like homesick for a place that I don't remember. 

So I deleted the voicemail.

It was back in my notification window by lunch.

The next few days, things got weirder. Small things then bigger, things I couldn't' ignore or write off.

My favorite coffee tasted like nothing. Like my taste buds stopped working. 

The streetlight outside my house started blinking in a pattern I became convinced was Morse Code. When I transcribed it though it spelled nothing. Or maybe it was something I just couldn't understand. Each night the the spaces in the pattern got longer.

One night I came home from work to find a dark bruise on my left shoulder. It was tender but undeniably old. Weeks old. I didn't remember any pain or any way I could've bruised myself like that. Then there was the scratches. Faint lines, symmetrical, like something with precision had grabbed me. Or adjusted me. 

I checked my sleep app of course, there were no disturbances. Just completely uninterrupted rest, it was recorded as deep sleep. Every night. I have insomnia, it was too perfect.

Then the dreams began.

Vast, black tunnels beneath a burning sky. A council of faceless shapes waiting in silence. I stood before them all, tall, alien and beloved. I remember speaking, but not the words. Just a feeling of great importance. Of command. And one singular phrase that lingered even after waking.

""Death is just the body ending. Memory is the real self.""

The second voicemail came a week later.

This time, the voice on the other end sounded different. Pained and pleading.

""You told us to wait. But it's been so long. Some of us didn't make it. Some forgot you completely. But we didn't. Not all of us. You said you'd come back when it was safe. It's safe now. Come back. Please.""

My hands shook like leaves as I played it. Something inside me shifted as I heard it. Like a gear clicking back into place. When I opened my eyes again, the light in my apartment was wrong. The angle was off. It was slight but definitely different. 

The TV moved several inches to the left on its mount on the wall. 

That night when I went to bed, a note waited for me on my nightstand.

In my own handwriting, I live by myself. 

""Do not answer if they call again, don't listen to those voicemails. You are not supposed to remember. You are not stable. Stay asleep.""

I ran to the bathroom and burned the note in the sink searing the wretched thing from this world. I didn't sleep a wink that night.

The days that followed I began seeing people who weren't... real. I don't know how else to explain it. Their movement were to precise. Their faces too still. The way they blinked with rhythm. And they watched me, but only when they thought I wasn't looking at them. In the corner of my vision, shapes loomed and flickered.

And the sky, was unexplainable, the blue was wrong. Too heavy, like it had been painted over something else.

I looked into the mirror one morning before work and my reflection smiled first.

I went to my doctor demanding scan after scan. A full workup. But the doctor. He smiled too much, asked questions that had nothing to do with my checkup.

""Do you remember your point of entry Diana?""

""What year did you say this was again?""

""Does it still hurt when you wake up?""

I left the doctor feeling more delusional than when I went in. That night I turned my phone completely off.

At 3:12 am, it rang anyway.

There was no ringtone. Just vibration. Low and steady. Like the hum of something deep underground.

I didn't answer it.

When I looked up my window was no longer facing the street like it should be. It faced another window..

In the window I saw myself. She was thinner, taller. Her eyes were too dark and she was staring back. Smiling.

I went to bed that night and when I woke up my bed was gone.

The air was different. Thicker, Like breathing underwater. The walls glistened like sweaty skin. It was organic. The room was the size of a cathedral but it pulsed like a lung. And across the chamber stood something. Almost human but not.

Too many eyes. No mouth, but when it spoke, it was with the same voice from the voicemails.

""Welcome back, Instructor.""

Behind the being was rows of them. Students, followers, whatever they are, they stood waiting.

""We kept the memory intact as long as we could. You asked us to. Was it peaceful? The dream?""

I couldn't speak. I wanted to scream. Or run. But something ancient in my blood told me. No. This is real. The rest was a dream.

The creature stepped forward. She placed a hand- smooth, glowing, wrong- on my shoulder.

""They need you again, we all do.""

Like a chorus of warbled nonsense they all spoke at once.

I’m planning a road trip from Southern Illinois up to Beaver Bay, MN on Lake Superior’s North Shore in early August. We’ll be staying 4 nights in Beaver Bay, with about 3 full days to explore the shore, and then looping back down through Wisconsin and Illinois.

**Trip Overview:**   

* Departing from southern Illinois   
* Heading up through St. Louis, Hannibal, Buddy Holly Crash Site (near Clear Lake, IA), Staying night in St. Paul. Travel up to rental on Sunday through Duluth.
* Staying in Beaver Bay, MN (4 nights)   
* Exploring the North Shore (Duluth to Grand Marais)   
* Coming back through Duluth, Madison, Rockford and back to southern IL

Roughly 1,690 miles total / 25 hours of driving🎯 

**On the Way Up (Southern IL → Beaver Bay):**   

* Any fun or scenic stops to break up the drive   
* Offbeat or historical roadside attractions   
* Easy hiking spots or cool nature areas   
* Anything worth going a little out of the way

**North Shore (Beaver Bay for 3 full days):**   

* Can’t-miss hikes (short or moderate)   
* Best waterfalls, overlooks, or beaches   
* Unique shops, lighthouses, or museums   
* Great food or coffee. ( I hear there are some good pies!)   

**On the Way Back (via Duluth → MN → WI → IL):**   

* Any quirky attractions or scenic routes
* Great local lunch/dinner stops   
* Offbeat or historical roadside attractions   
* Good Place to stay overnight in southern Wisconsin or Northern Illinois.

Would love any suggestions for hidden gems, scenic detours, or personal favorites, especially from folks familiar with Wisconsin, Minnesota’s North Shore, or the drive through Iowa and Missouri.

So you're going to go up to all the people you told you'd be successful and who made fun of it, you'll show them.

You feel something is wrong.
Not outside. Not in the world. Inside.
The emptiness, the agitation, the false smiles, the routine.
You do what is expected of you. You smile when you need to. You say “it’s okay” when it’s not okay.

Not for discussion.
To act.

A place for those who want to break down to rebuild themselves.

➤ Get out of comfort.
➤ Set goals. Real. Hard. Which are scary.

More About Me

I’m all about stories—whether they come from books, music, movies, games, or deep conversations over coffee. I love weird trivia, overlooked places, and ideas that make you pause for a second.

I stay active in my own way: nature walks, home workouts, and exploring whenever I can. I speak Spanish, love finding hidden gems in new cities, and believe in asking good questions and listening closely to the answers.

Above all, I notice the small stuff. The way someone lights up when talking about something they love. The little rituals that matter. The details most people miss.

⸻

What I’m Looking For

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Curious, kind, and unapologetically themselves
	•	Into meaningful connection, thoughtful conversation, and shared moments that actually matter

I’m open to friendship, connection, or something deeper—whatever feels natural. Long-distance is fine. Age gaps and different backgrounds don’t scare me. If we vibe, we vibe.

I’m attracted to all body types. Energy, connection, and chemistry matter more than any one look.

⸻

Why You Should Message Me

If you’re looking for something intentional—with someone creative, curious, emotionally steady, and actually fun to talk to—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just a good conversation and maybe something worth continuing.

Tell me something about you—your favorite small joy, the weirdest rabbit hole you’ve gone down lately, or the most random thing you’ve Googled this week.

I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.  I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

1lsmxo6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lsmxo6,Yeti 30oz tumbler 1 Year in,"A year ago I wanted a larger coffee cup that looks nice, I could bring along with me while simply sticking a lid on it and being out the door. I also customized it so there would never be a mistake as to who it belongs to and if taken there would always be my name smack center on the front of the cup. It’s a year now I’ve had this tumbler and it’s definitely a keeper. I have used this tumbler everyday basically being the only cup I drink out of but the majority of the time it’s hot coffee in the morning and ice water the remainder of the day and by bedside for  late night sips of cold water when needed . There have been many times I’ve used this tumbler for cereal, soups, ice cream, tea, Beer and Soda which all works great however I do find  carbonated drinks become flat quickly if I don’t finish them quickly. No swampy wet car cup holders, water rings on tables or wet clammy hands because this Tumbler doesn’t sweat. Yes it will leak a little bit from the MagSafe if you knock it over on a table. I have not dropped it yet on the ground but I suppose you may experience a heavier leak or expect if accidentally dropped high enough, a completely filled 30oz tumbler MagSafe lid could potentially pop off (hopefully it won’t) it’s a rubber seal keeping the MagSafe lid on so what would you expect . Drinks stay cool for a long time and will remain colder for a longer period of time depending on how much ice you add to your drink. If I fill my tumbler with HOT coffee at 8am, I would say by 2pm it would be warm and remain warm until 5 or 6. Remember it’s basically a Thermos so if you rinse it out with hot water and immediately fill it with cold water, the water will not keep its cool temperature as long as it would if you filled it at room temp or at a cooler temperature because it will retain the heat and vice versa with any cold beverages to hot. When stains appear I use a Mr. Clean eraser sponge to clean the coffee stains out and the rubber washer seal is washed weekly. Was this custom tumbler worth it to me high price and all, yes definitely I’m constantly using it everyday. Still Looks awesome and it does what it supposed to do the Yeti 30oz tumbler keeps drinks hot when you want them hot and it Keeps drinks cold when you want them cold. Oh and if your Tumbler has customized engraving on it, Do Not wash it in a dishwasher because my understanding the the paint around the engraved area can possibly chip however if you don’t have customized engraving it should be fine dishwasher safe.

Alright, Reddit fam, I gotta share my latest obsession: this textured tote bag I snagged a few weeks ago. I've been on a never-ending quest for that ""chic everyday bag"" that can actually handle my life without falling apart, and I think I've finally hit the jackpot.

Let's be real, finding a women's bag that's both stylish and practical is like finding a unicorn. I was initially drawn to this one because of its unique look – the textured material and that gold chain handbag detail? So classy! But I was also skeptical. Could it *really* hold all my stuff and still look good?

First impressions: the texture is amazing. It feels way more expensive than it actually was, which is always a plus. The gold chain strap adds a touch of elegance without being over the top. I’m not usually one for flashy accessories, but this is subtle enough to wear to work or out for coffee with friends. And yes, I've already gotten a few compliments. 😊

But let's get down to brass tacks: practicality. I need a bag that can handle my laptop (yes, even the bulky one), a water bottle, my wallet, phone, and the endless supply of snacks I seem to carry around. This stylish women's tote actually delivers! It's surprisingly roomy without feeling like I'm lugging around a suitcase. Plus, I can actually *find* things in it. No more digging for five minutes to locate my keys!

One of the biggest reasons I decided to try this bag was because I was tired of buying cheap bags that would rip or fall apart after a few months. It was costing me more money in the long run to keep replacing them. This one feels different. The stitching is solid, the material is thick enough to withstand my daily abuse, and the chain strap feels super secure. I'm hoping this means I won't have to go bag shopping again for a while!

I also love how put-together it makes me feel. I know that sounds silly, but when I'm rushing out the door in the morning, throwing everything into this bag makes me feel like I'm at least somewhat organized, even if my life is a complete mess. 😂 It just elevates my whole look, you know?

I think it’s a great choice for women aged 25-55 who value style, quality, and convenience. If you’re a busy professional, a student, or just someone who likes to be prepared, this bag could be a good fit. It really does solve that daily frustration of carrying bulky or unattractive bags that don't suit your style or needs.

I stumbled upon this bag while browsing on ursupermart.com, and I was immediately drawn to its unique aesthetic. The combination of the textured material and the gold chain strap really sets it apart from other tote bags I've seen. It's that perfect blend of style and function that I was looking for.

Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Is it *really* worth it?"" And honestly, that depends on what you're looking for. If you just need something to carry your groceries, this might be overkill. But if you want a bag that's stylish, practical, and durable, then I think it's a solid investment. I’ve been using it daily for a few weeks now, and it still looks brand new.

It’s one of those things that just makes my life a little easier, you know? I don’t have to worry about whether my bag complements my outfit, and I can actually find my stuff when I need it. Plus, it’s helped me feel more confident and organized, and that’s worth a lot to me. If you’re curious, you can check it out here: https://go.ursupermart.com/2JY000

I’d say if you’re looking for a stylish women's tote that can handle your everyday essentials and make you feel like you've got your life together (even when you don't!), this is definitely worth checking out. It’s helped me feel more confident and organized, and that’s worth a lot to me.

Let me know if you have any questions! I'm happy to share more about my experience. 😊 If you are curious about the best everyday tote bag for stylish women, here’s the one I got: https://go.ursupermart.com/2JY000",1,1751757111.0,SuperMartScoop,0,1.0,False
1lsmsdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1lsmsdf/my_20_secret_weapon_against_dull_skin/,My $20 Secret Weapon Against Dull Skin,"My wife and I were looking for a new espresso machine to upgrade our at-home coffee ritual. We’d been using a basic Moka pot for years, but wanted something more convenient and capable of producing a wider variety of espresso-based drinks.  After weeks of research, comparing models and reading reviews, we finally settled on the Breville Barista Express.  This review details our experience after several months of daily use.

## Brewing Performance

The Breville Barista Express shines in its brewing capabilities.  The integrated conical burr grinder is a game-changer; it consistently delivers finely ground beans, resulting in rich, flavorful espresso shots every time.  We experimented with different grind sizes and tamping pressures to fine-tune the process, and the machine's responsiveness made this experimentation easy and enjoyable.  The pressure gauge is also a great feature, allowing for precise control over the extraction process. While it takes a little practice to master, the results are well worth the effort.

## Ease of Use

Initially, we were a little intimidated by the number of dials and settings. However, the user manual is surprisingly clear and concise, guiding us through the process step-by-step.  After a few uses, we felt comfortable navigating all the functions.  The automatic milk frothing system is a standout feature; it's quick, easy, and produces perfectly textured milk for lattes and cappuccinos. Cleaning is also relatively straightforward, although a thorough clean (including backflushing) takes about 10 minutes, which some users might find inconvenient.

## Milk Frothing System

The automatic milk frothing system is a significant upgrade from our old Moka pot.  It effortlessly creates rich, velvety microfoam, essential for latte art and achieving the creamy texture desired in specialty coffee drinks.  We've experimented with different types of milk, and the system handles them all well, consistently producing excellent results.  The cleaning process for the frothing system is quick and easy – a big plus for busy mornings.

## Build Quality & Design

The Barista Express feels robust and well-built. The stainless steel casing looks sleek and modern, and the machine feels solid and sturdy.  It doesn't feel cheap or flimsy in any way.  The integrated grinder is a significant factor in its higher weight and larger footprint compared to some smaller machines, but this doesn't detract from its overall appeal.  We appreciate the thoughtful design features like the easy-to-fill water reservoir and the readily accessible drip tray.

## Value

At $700 (the price fluctuates slightly depending on the retailer), the Breville Barista Express is a significant investment. However, compared to other similarly equipped espresso machines, it offers excellent value for its features and performance.  Many comparable models cost significantly more, particularly those with similarly high-quality built-in grinders.  While the initial price might seem high, the consistent quality and convenience justify the investment for serious coffee lovers.

## Maintenance

Maintaining the Breville Barista Express requires regular cleaning, particularly of the portafilter, group head, and milk frothing wand.  The machine itself requires backflushing (a process for clearing coffee oils and grounds) about once a week, a task that is reasonably straightforward once you get the hang of it.  The cleaning process is also reasonably quick; about 10 minutes per week for a thorough clean.

## Noise Level

The machine is moderately noisy during both grinding and brewing.  The grinder is quite audible but the noise isn't excessively loud or jarring.  The pump isn't overly noisy either. This noise level is typical for espresso machines of this type and shouldn’t be a deal breaker for most users.

**Pros:**

* Excellent espresso quality
* Integrated conical burr grinder
* User-friendly interface (after a learning curve)
* Automatic milk frothing system
* Durable and well-built

**Cons:**

* Relatively high price
* Can be loud during grinding
* Requires regular cleaning and backflushing

**Value Proposition & Price Analysis:**

At $700, the Breville Barista Express is a premium espresso machine. Compared to most rivals offering similar features (integrated grinder and automatic frothing), it’s competitively priced. While cheaper espresso machines are available, they typically lack the quality of the integrated grinder or the automatic frothing capabilities which ultimately justify the higher price point.  It's a premium pick for those who value quality, convenience, and consistent results.

**Final Verdict & Recommendation:**

The Breville Barista Express delivers on its promise of high-quality espresso at home.  While the initial cost is significant, the consistent performance, ease of use (once learned), and the excellent coffee it produces make it well worth the investment for serious coffee enthusiasts.  I highly recommend it to anyone serious about their coffee and is prepared to invest the time to master the process.  Skip this machine only if your budget is extremely tight.",1,1751757100.0,badreviewer,0,1.0,False

At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right?

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

Hey r/Shopping,

Anyone else feel like finding jewelry that *actually* matches your vibe is a total mission? I was so over the same old boring studs and hoops.

After way too much scrolling, I finally found these Gold Skull Dangle Earrings with Rhinestones, and I had to share my thoughts.

First off, the design is killer. Skulls! But not the scary, Halloween-y kind. These are more like cute-badass. The gold plating gives them a touch of elegance, and the colorful rhinestones add just the right amount of sparkle. I’ve already gotten so many compliments. Seriously, I wore them to a concert last week, and someone stopped me to ask where I got them. That never happens with my plain Jane earrings.

What really sold me was that they’re a statement piece. I'm all about simplifying my life, and these earrings do just that. I can throw on a simple black top or a plain t-shirt and jeans, and these earrings instantly elevate the whole look. No need to pile on a bunch of other accessories. These babies do all the work. Plus, they're super easy to wear, which is always a win in my book.

I was a little worried about the quality, to be honest. I've bought skull earrings before that were cheap and flimsy, and the stones fell out after a week. But these seem really well-made. The construction feels durable, and the rhinestones are securely set. I've been wearing them for a couple of weeks now, and they still look brand new.

Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Skull earrings? Aren't those a little…out there?"" And maybe they are for some people. But if you're like me and you're looking for a way to express your individuality and stand out from the crowd, these earrings are definitely worth checking out. They're perfect for anyone who loves fashion, music, art, or alternative culture. If you are confident, edgy, expressive, and trendsetting, these are for you. They solve a real problem for me: finding jewelry that truly expresses who I am.

I was specifically looking for gold skull dangle earrings with colorful rhinestones for women, and they popped right up. I did a little research before buying, of course. I read a few reviews and compared styles and prices. I'm not super price-sensitive, but I do want to make sure I'm getting good value for my money. And I definitely feel like I got my money's worth with these earrings.

I think what I love most about these earrings is that they solve a real problem for me. I've always struggled to find jewelry that truly expresses my personality. Everything in the mainstream stores just looks the same. These earrings are different. They're bold, edgy, and colorful. They make me feel confident and unique. And that's exactly what I was looking for.

Another thing I love is how versatile they are. I can throw them on with a simple black tee and jeans to add some edge to a casual look, or I can dress them up with a little black dress for a night out. They instantly elevate any outfit and make me feel like I'm rocking a super unique style. I’ve gotten so many “OMG, I love your earrings!” comments already.

And honestly, finding something that’s both bold *and* easy to wear is a win. I hate when I buy jewelry that looks amazing but is a pain to put on or feels uncomfortable all day. These are lightweight and the dangle length is just right – they move and catch the light without getting in the way. It simplifies accessorizing outfits so much.

I spend way too much time scrolling through sites trying to find something that isn't cookie-cutter, and it's exhausting. These earrings solved that problem instantly. I'm all about maximizing impact with minimal effort, y'know? These do it. You can find lots of things on different sites, I even get my groceries sometimes from ursupermart.com.

If you're looking to step up your jewelry game and show off your personality, I highly recommend checking these out. I used to grab anything that looked shiny, but now I’m much more selective. I actually ordered them online after seeing a similar pair on someone's Insta, and I haven't regretted it for a second.

They are a total statement piece. I’m so over having to pile on a bunch of accessories to get noticed, these earrings do all the work themselves.

They're gold plated, so they have a good shine and look. The vibrant colors just pop, and I’ve been loving how they look in the photos I’ve been posting. I wanted something different, and these deliver on that 100%.

These earrings have been saving me so much time and frustration. No more blending in or feeling ordinary! I feel confident, bold, unique, and expressive whenever I wear them. It’s such an easy way to instantly boost my mood and style. Plus, I get compliments all day!

If you’re looking for unique gold skull earrings for alternative fashion, these might be just the thing. I snagged them here if you’re curious 👉 https://go.ursupermart.com/G9035N
