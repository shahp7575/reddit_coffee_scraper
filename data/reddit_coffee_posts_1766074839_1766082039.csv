I’ll be in **Rhodes from Dec 28 to Jan 4**, traveling solo. Planning to explore the Old Town, bars, cafés, and whatever’s happening around New Year’s.



Not looking for anything complicated — just curious if anyone else will be around during that time and wants to grab a coffee, explore, or do something social.



If you’ll be there, feel free to comment or DM.

Like, it’s almost a cheat code that I see so many devs overlook. 

I used to think I could just do everything online, you know? But after pushing myself to go to meetups and grab coffee with local folks, it changed everything. I’ve met other builders, exchanged ideas, and even got feedback on my projects that I just wouldn’t have gotten otherwise. 

It's pretty wild how much a simple conversation can spark new ideas or help troubleshoot a problem you've been stuck on for a while. I mean, you don’t have to go into a full networking mode, just being present and sharing a bit of your journey goes a long way. 

If you’re building something solo, seriously consider getting out there. Not just for potential partnerships, but for the support and inspiration too. It’s kind of crazy how much a community can uplift you. Anyone else had similar experiences?""",1,1766081877.0,microsaas,0,1.0,False

Prepare yourself, prepare yourself for slaughter, famine as souls are examined, lack of water

The end is close in sight, newlyweds better cancel all plans, in Orwellian olympics they contend

The end is an arms reach away, you won't find dismay, when you acquire you’re cannon fodder 

Prepare yourself, prepare yourself brother for the end, to so called friends, letters you will send 

  


Prepare yourself, prepare yourself for the cleansing, flesh and bloody bone, we are condensing

The end presents its serpentine fangs, hissing, slithering, it’s gonna consume all in it’s sight

The end wraps around the superannuated, cutting off bloodstreams, beams of venom dispensing

Prepare yourself, prepare yourself sister, hurricanes aren't twisters, all pray at the campsite 

  


Prepare yourself, prepare yourself for the truth, we’re detaching with age like a baby tooth 

The end looms over your psyche, you know it’s real, but it’s unrevealed and concealed 

The end knows all of your flaws, how you often feel, of what's real, you wish to save the truth

Prepare yourself, prepare yourself young men, cocks and hens in pecking orders congealed

  


Prepare yourself, prepare yourself for extinction, from ghouls and mortal fools, no distinction

The end is the lazaretto and emergency escape, it is abstinence and rape, sledgehammer and tape

The end is the coffee in the morning, joyous cries and mourning, emotional ebbs of instinction

Prepare yourself, prepare yourself young women, you will be courted, by apes eating grapes

  


Prepare yourself, prepare yourself for the valley floor, humanity is a concubine, but not a whore

The end lulls toddlers and twiddling little ones, tells them to murder mothers, steal the only sons

The end creeps up from counters and cabinets, finds you when nothing has purpose anymore 

Prepare yourself, prepare yourself engrieved for the bereaved, you too, will see the fall of the sun

  


Prepare yourself, prepare yourself for the instruction from an apparition, conditions colonial 

The end reeks of an ineffable stench, it could lie on a bus seat or a park bench, it waits patiently

The end vows fidelity and faithfulness, matrimonial testimonials of an event only ceremonial 

Prepare yourself, prepare yourself intertwined lovers needing no other, for the spiritual vacancy

  


Prepare yourself, prepare yourself for exasperation, once finished you reach a destination so rife

The end is a curse, it hands you charms that harm, it blinds you with darkness, unstraps harnesses

The end is a purse, you fill it up to try to distract yourself, from the all present emptying of life 

Prepare yourself, prepare yourself triathlon triple threat jovial jock, your flesh is forever carnous

  


The end is an excessively exuberant exercise of free will, it is what birthed you, it is what kills 

Think to yourself, do you understand these words? If not, study them, for they must be heard

Beware of, prepare yourself for, the end, you cannot escape it, and no one else ever can nor will

1ppxw7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoHangoutFriends/comments/1ppxw7c/looking_for_girlfriends/,Looking for Girlfriends :),"Hi everyone!

I’m based downtown Toronto and currently in university, and I’d love to build a solid group of girl friends to do fun things together! Think PJ parties, movie nights, hikes, long walks, coffee dates, and other cute get-togethers.

A bit about me: In my last year of uni, and feeling like I was so focused on school that I didn’t go out and explore. Have majorrrr regrets about this and hoping to rectify this through all of you lovelies. I’m a crafty person by nature so I love love art, music and enjoy random side quests. I have 5 cats! Into Kpop, travelling, learning new languages. 

As the new year comes, I’d also really love to connect with girls who are interested in getting healthier together like workout sessions, trying a boxing class, fitness classes, or just keeping each other motivated.

I’m hoping to build strong, long-term friendships. With so many people working remotely or busy with school, it can be hard to meet new people, so I thought I’d put this out there.

I’m mainly looking for girls in the 21–26 age range, but all are welcome! If you’re also in the downtown core, that’s definitely a plus.

If this sounds like your vibe, send me your Instagram and I’ll add you to a group so we can start planning 💕

Looking forward to meeting some amazing girls!",0,1766081766.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,1,0.25,False

Whereas if it gives me anxiety just thinking about it, I know there's no way on earth I could do it no matter what so I don't apply.

Problem is that I always get my hopes up and then I either don't get a call OR I get an interview and bomb the interview followed by a rejection.

I just applied for a job at a coffee shop and feel like I could do this job, but I can only work limited hours due to being on SSDI, so I don't know if they will hire me. I've been crying and begging God every since I applied this morning, as they told me they ""may call me today"" and haven't called yet.

Ugh. Hate getting my hopes dashed. I'd love to have a job to supplement my SSDI, which is too low to really sustain myself at this point, or maybe barely sustain myself. So I currently live with my parents. Plus I've hit a lull in life and need something exciting to look forward to.

When I back to my home country I didn’t have any friends and I was feeling alone, 
I have 3 sisters and they close in age so they didn’t have problems with that and they can make friends easily and tbh they know how to make friends better than me. 

In high school I only makes 3 friends 
And one of them is Chris and Sam and mark
Chris have 4 sisters and I want to remember his younger sister Cath because we going to talk about her later . 

My friendship with those 3 boys is amazing 
I know them since 2017 . 

And they know each others since kindergarten, 
And they let meet their group of friends they are 10 and nine of them is Chris cousins from his mom side and one is from his dad side. 

So basically we are 14 me and the Chris and Sam and mark and Chris 10 cousins 
We all boys . 

Those guys become more than friends they become my brothers and I hang out daily with them and even their mothers and sisters become my sisters and mom friends. 

I attend 5 of this guys wedding and even Chris big sister wedding. 

Me and Chris and the boys were so close , we traveled together , we go to same college , everything was perfect between me and Chris and Sam and mark  and the rest of the group  

More information I meet Chris and the boys 2017 . 

If I need something or I got in trouble I call Chris 
He was my brother and I can’t see him less of this . 

He help with many things and he always comes if I need him no matter what the time no matter what he was . 

And I did the same for him . 

I swear some people things were are brothers because we were dressed the same and our style was same . 

In his wedding in April 2024 I was his best man , 
Not Sam not mark or his cousins , he chose me and it’s meant a lot for me . 

But after he back from honeymoon he was different , he was cold and destined , he and the boys start hanging out without me , they plans for things without me or I know in the last seconds , 
And even when he invited me it was because I’m plan B for him . 

I didn’t want to give up on our friendship like this, so I invited him to many things, restaurants, coffee shops, trips and 70% he rejected my plans . 

So I give up on our friendships and even the rest of the group was the same like Chris  .

I start hanging out with another guy  Martin from another group and he doesn’t know Chris and the boys. 

And we become good friends and he let me meet his group of friends and the welcoming me with open arms and they were so kind and supportive and I love to spend time with them and even one of them is dating my younger sister for 1 year . 

But I want to add more information in Chris wedding , I meet a girl and now she’s my girlfriend and we dating since April 2024 and I even start thinking to ask her to marry me in valentine day. 

But I never knows what happened between me and Chris and why he cut me completely from 2024 may to 2025 June , he start calling and contacting me and want us to hanging out again and he apologised many times and even Sam and mark apologised and the rest of the group .

But I didn’t want to hanging out with them like old days, I only see them one every month . 

And I only hangout with Martin and his group of friends and my two BIL . 

I hated Chris for what he did to me over a year and how he makes feel so small and pathetic and I don’t want even to go talk with him anymore but I let him back in my life but not like the past. 

I was hanging out with Chris and Sam , Mark 
And the topic of my proposal to my gf and the wedding came up and Chris asked me who is going to be my best man and I said One of my BIL . 

Chris face become white and I can see the hurt in his eyes and he said why not him and I said you cut me off over a year and makes me feel like outsider and Mark didn’t even make me one of his groomsmen (mark wedding was in 2024 September) and I continue saying he can be one of my groomsmen, he nodded and Sam change the subject. 

I back home and tell my gf what happened and she sit down and explain everything why Chris did this .

My gf is Chris younger sister close friends 
Chris younger sister is Catherine . 

For the record Cath and I was friends and she was hanging out with me and Chris and I never see her more than a friend or like a younger sister but it seems she have different feelings. 

See Cath in the late of 2023 tells me her feelings towards me and she want to date me and I rejected her for many reasons . 

One I fear in the future if me and her broke up , Chris will hate me or end his friendship with me.
Two her family is well off and I can’t give her .
the same things her dad gives her .
Three I didn’t see her more than friends .
Four our personality is different .
Five what if Chris doesn’t want his best friend to date his sister. 

So I rejected her and I know it’s hurt her feelings but I swear she can find better man than me and I didn’t want to destroy my relationship with Chris . 

And I meet my gf in Chris wedding and we dated since 2024 may . 

So when Cath saw me and my gf dancing in the wedding she gets so upset and mad at me and my gf .

She block my gf and cut contact with her. 

And Cath go to Chris and lie to him that I was trying to date her and she rejected me many times and I stalked her and bother her and sending her many texts and calls every day and she didn’t want to tell Chris that cuz she didn’t want our friendship to end . 

I asked my gf why she didn’t tell me and she didn’t give me a reason and I didn’t push to answer. 

But she told me Chris knows the truth after one year when Cath see Chris so sad and upset because he and I didn’t hanging out like old days and Cath spill the truth. 

I go to Chris apartment in the same night he open the door and I told him let’s walk together outside. 

And I told him I  can’t believe you take your sister words without even try to talk with or take my side of the story, I can’t believe you throw away everything and years of friendship like this. 

I continue yelling at him and I can see his tears and I stop and I said don’t try to cry now , I cry many nights alone when you cancel me and push me away . 

I walk away some steps and he said it’s my younger sister Peter , what do you want to do if my sister cames to me and told me that. 

I shake my head and continue walking away. 

I back to my place and cry in my gf arms . 

What do I so do? 

Do I let Chris back to my live , or cut him completely and move on with my life? 

Some notes : all the names are fakes and this account is throw away account and English isn’t my first language.

1ppxtkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pureretention/comments/1ppxtkm/was_wondering_if_there_was_a_reddit_community_for/,Was wondering if there was a Reddit community for “us”,"28 y/o, on my 90th day. I won’t call any of the things that I’ve noticed “benefits”, because they are the birthrights of a child of God. But I will say the transformation and journey back to the “natural” state has more than exceeded my expectations. A deafening presence everywhere I go. People are either noticeably uneasy in my presence or they can’t leave me alone. People of all ages are constantly staring at me. My voice is already naturally pretty deep, but it’s taken on this kind of engulfing attribute where it just fills up the room or house. I’m feeling more love for my family (one that I never saw coming). I want to be around them more. I never really had a coffee “addiction” per se, but I would certainly take some down. I have zero desire for coffee these days. I have people that I haven’t talked to in months/years that are contacting me. It’s not a coincidence. It’s never happened. And the final thing I’ll say is that everything is somehow more enjoyable. More beautiful. In the midst of my very busy life I somehow feel like a kid again. I’m not bragging or anything of the sort, I assure you that this is just my testimony. 

For anybody struggling, try not to think in terms of streaks. Think of this as a lifestyle and a daily battle. *a daily battle*.

1ppxsuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ppxsuy/psychedelic_effect_of_caffeine/,Psychedelic effect of caffeine,"Hello everyone,

**tl;nr** *Have any of you experienced weirder than usual effects on caffeine after a long abstention period?*

I'll start by saying I never had a big relationship with caffeine. While I did enjoy for a time the art of occasional green tea making the habit never was a daily thing. I did took a cup of coffee here and there but nothing pushed me to a daily consumption like social gathering tends to make us do, and actually never really felt any of its effect but for its infamous occasional bowels movements.

Anyhow, some years ago I came across an antique french press and decided to try it. At this time I was my usual uncaffeinated self and the effects was instantaneous and mind blowing : an explosion of creative elation bursting with elevated qualia and high social tendencies. The thing last for about 2 hours before getting back to my usual self.

Of course following this experience I planned to rediscover its effects, unbeknownst to me then the usual dopamine renormalization shenanigans run it's course on me. Trying the experiment again one or two days after did nothing to my neurons akin to my first trial. A while passed until ""research"" finally shown me that in order to enjoy it back I had to cut all kind of caffeine for at least 2 weeks, the more the merrier. It became an once a new moon Sunday fantasy, sadly unpractical to derive any long term benefits from it, but interesting nonetheless on the occasion.

It might be of interest to note that, for some reasons, it never happened to work beside using a french press. No espresso did the stuff albeit I am no barista.

Anyways, as intrigued by these effects as I could be, I never could find someone to confirm them on their own until a few year back were I came across that well known Michel Pollan clip on a Joe Rogan podcast : 
https://youtu.be/mAPG18zNtXk

Nowadays I cut the substance back as I prefer that lifestyle, however as this place is one of the rare ones were peoples have experienced long enough periods of uncaffeinated thoughts I wondered if any of you had such weird experiences that are really hard to put in words but using superlatives, which I'll easily qualify as psychedelic.

Thanks you!

1ppxs6p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ppxs6p,I joined the cherry pie gang! Here are my tierlists (enjoyment and difficulty) and overall thoughts on the collection and individual games.,"I was looking to get every cherry (it took 275hrs) so I could share my opinions on this game, and I’ve finally made it! I included a tierlist with my personal enjoyment of the games and one with difficulty (which is biased to games which are difficult to execute rather than to solve).

Let me start by saying this has been one of the best gaming experiences of my entire life.

I find UFO 50 revolutionary in our current gaming industry: instead of trying to showcase technical muscle, gargantuan open worlds and overambitious experiences, this game focuses on rather small ideas with (sometimes) pretty straightforward executions. This doesn’t mean it lacks depth; on the contrary, I would say UFO 50 is “focused”.

Not only that but I think conceptually UFO 50 might be one of the most exciting games of all time with its “lost collection from an extinct early-videogame developer” metanarrative, which in my opinion works so well both getting you into the experience and establishing links between all the games (like for instance sequels which have nothing to do gameplay-wise with their precurors).

With all of that praise out of the way, I want to clarify that I used guides for many of the games in order to get some cherries. I needed it for most coffees in Warptank and some in Campanella, for the warps/routes in Mooncat, for specific endings in Valbrace and Grimstone, for a couple of collectibles on Porgy, Vainger or Golfaria… I also needed to check some video walkthroughs on Cyber Owls, Star Waspir, Campanella 2, Fist Hell or Rakshasa in order to beat them (as well as extensively reading the wikis). Oh, and I couldn’t figure Barbuta on my own, but more of that later. My general advice is to only use guides when you are really stuck and try to figure things out on your own, but many times I must admit that I struggle and rely on them a bit too much. I’ll try to work on it, though.

Here are some comments on each game for those who care to read some random dude’s opinion on them. I chose to go from least liked to favorites. English is not my native language so I struggled a bit conveying my thoughts, let’s say, in a more readable and creative way, so I’m sorry about that. It also turned out to be a very, very long text. Sorry, again.



**D Tier:**



*The Big Bell Race:* 

Honestly, nothing inherently wrong with it, I just found it a little bit too shallow and easy. I didn't find any reasons to play it again.



**C Tier:**



*Block Koala:* 

Too long for its own good (30 or so puzzles would have been enough) but I ended up enjoying solving it. I avoided guides but I admit I needed hints on a couple of these.

Besides being a bit of a slog, I felt like Block Koala is a bit of a troll game in a way. The music is sort of illness-inducing. There’s some mechanics which feel bugged (like doors and those guys who mirror your moveset) and I’m pretty sure I accidentally cheated 1 or 2 riddles because of it. I also liked that some levels try to make you make a certain move which will absolutely misguide you and prevent you from getting the star to the exit. As I said, a troll game, but pretty fun at times.



*Hyper Contender:* 

A very interesting core idea but the roster feels very unbalanced, although every character has something going for them. I just didn’t play it much but I kind of want to try it on multiplayer and maybe it will go up on my enjoyment list.



*Camouflage:* 

Again, a rewarding game with nothing negative but a bit too easy and straightforward for my taste.



*Divers:* 

A lot of good moments with decent exploration, but the farming and battle system didn’t work too well for me. A bold game like most of Eirik’s which I appreciate more than I enjoy.



*Caramel Caramel:* 

Very serviceable shmup/autoscroller with fun stage design, interesting enemies and mechanics. I like that the first stage is sort of the hardest in retrospect (not fun at all at first, lol).



*Combatants:* 

I don’t really get all the hate this gets. I get similar vibes out of Block Koala: a game that embraces a bit of jank. Unbalanced stage design requires you to think out of the box and find methods outside of what you should be doing in a game like this. If Combatants worked properly, it would be pretty unremarkable imo. Obviously this is not the type of game I love to play but I see what it’s trying to achieve and I appreciate it. Art is not always enjoyment but a way to explore media and communicate different things, and I see Combatants fitting well into this definition.



*Campanella 3*: 

Very cool idea for a shmup. My biggest problem with this is having trouble estimating where enemies are and when they are going to hit me, but otherwise it was challenging and pleasant enough.



*Bushido Ball:* 

Similar to Hyper Contender, I didn’t play much of this but I felt it was a bit more interesting. I have to try it further on multiplayer because AI did some random shit.



*Porgy:* 

At times I loved this but as many others I also felt a bit frustrated with all the necessary backtracking, although I definitely enjoyed it overall. I dig the way bosses and upgrades work.



*Waldorf’s Journey:* 

The OST on this is absolutely stellar. The multiplayer versus is hilarious. The single player is very original but also simple enough. My only complaint is that I don’t see myself coming back to it after cherrying it, but it was a fun time.



*Star Waspir:* 

Many things have been said about this artifact from hell itself. The visual clutter is obvious and the combo/letter system aggravates it to the point of insanity. Stage 3 is absolutely criminal: those red enemies throwing absurdly small projectiles leave you little room to maneuver and the RNG big asteroids are a big FUCK YOU to the player. So, why not lower? Because beating it felt insane. I had zero lifes when I reached stage 4 for the second time ever, I entered flow state, my reflexes were 3x times faster than normal and I managed to beat it with 100k more points than I needed. After I relaxed my brain and muscles, I felt dizzy and nauseous and almost pass out. You can’t deny extremes aren’t fun sometimes. Maybe you can. Forget you’ve read any of that. It’s cool you can try 3 ships :)



**B Tier:**



*Seaside Drive:* 

Pretty and challening but clearly on the easier side of the collection. Took me less than an hour and I haven’t come back to it.



*Planet Zoldath:* 

Weirdly underrated game in my opinion. Yes, I know you can get softlocked and stuff like that but I think it illustrates pretty well the feel of a very primitive and simple adventure-roguelike game. Zoldath is charming but dangerous and discovering how the game works was exciting.



*Pilot Quest:* 

An absurd grindfest but with a nice added in idler concept which gels well with the rest of the collection. Similar to Zoldath, exploration and understanding how the game is supposed to be played was very compelling. The main track for this has a surreal Earthbound-like feeling and it goes really hard.



*Campanella 2:* 

Man, I wished I liked this more! I love Spelunky and Camp 2 is obviously the most similar game to that in the collection. It’s a thrilling experience for the most part but a couple of flaws ruined it for me a little bit. In the first place, the side-scrolling sections, especially from Burrows, become extremely repetitive very early on, making the gameplay loop worse. Secondly, the RNG with stars in the overworld can fuck up many runs, which felt cheap (the rng in some side-scrolling sections can also screw you over). The items condition your run heavily but you can make it work with different combinations.

On the more positive side, I loved the branching paths, the different areas and overworld enemies are insanely good and make you feel genuinely scared/cautious of what you may find. The setting, which includes both Isabel and Pilot is probably the most well done of the Campanella/Pilot series.



*Devilition:* 

It took me many tries to get the cherry, but I think it was mostly because I’m a retard. Let me know if you also make an incredibly complex chain in which you forgot to link some key pieces and ended up not triggering half of the stuff you put on the board / you made the perfect wombo combo but you left one demon alive because you overlooked something trivial. Man. Still addicting and fun.



*Mortol 2:* 

I loved the concept on this one although sometimes the movement/controls feel janky. Figuring the map on your own is extremely rewarding, so don’t look anything up until you get the gold! I needed some help for the cherry, though.



*Elfazar’s Hat:* 

A refreshing twist on shmups with tight controls. Stage and enemy design were almost top-notch and the bosses mostly slap. Challenging but manageable.



*Paint Chase:* 

One of those games which took a lot of time to click for me. It seemed impossible to cherry at first but once you understand certain “hidden” mechanics, it becomes doable. A risky concept that ends up working really well.



*Magic Garden:* 

A lovely game which I beat in less than an hour and never really came back to. I adore the imagery on the main screen. I haven’t talked about this yet but I’m extremely glad UFO 50 chooses to endorse a diverse character roster, particularly not sexualizing women and making very charismatic female characters.



*Warptank:* 

It took me a while to get into this, but man it ended up being so good at times. Sometimes I was a bit frustrated with the controls, I feel like if there was a small delay between input and response which made it harder to control than it needed to be. I have mixed feelings on some stages but most of them are at least good, with some being excellent level design. Many banger songs on this one as well.



*Campanella:* 

I dig the simple structure of the game with 9 levels per stage and a final boss. The controls are tight and a bit tricky to master at first. The way levels work also encourages exploration and experimentation. One thing I haven’t really read about this is that it has this otherworldy/surreal and abstract feeling which is not as prevalent in the sequels. Overall the most solid of the Camp series for me.



*Vainger:* 

Theta sector music didn’t really need to go nearly as hard, because this game is already very good without it. Although it is a pretty obvious Metroid clone theme-wise, the VVVVV flip mechanics are well interwoven into the gameplay and it feels a bit better to play (to me, at least) than Warptank. Exploration and backtracking are decently balanced and overall I had a great time.



*Attactics:* 

I don’t have many deep thoughts on this one other than I found it refreshing and fun, but not very challenging overall. Is it me or every time a mission featured archers everything became a bit too easy? I guess if you keep playing ranked matches it gets harder but I basically stopped after the cherry.



*Lords of Diskonia:* 

Along with Zoldath, I think this one is underrated. At first the whole concept was alien to me but once I understood how it worked, I was locked in. The AI does the funniest shit you can possibly imagine. Once I was facing a single bard and a soldier when I had my whole army at full health, so I make a move with my dragon to get close and the enemy makes a move: The bard rebounds on his soldier and a fountain three times getting their health up by +2 each, and then he buffs him 5 times in the first two rebounds and the third one actually establishes a puppet government in Nicaragua. My mouth was wide open. After that I won the battle, outplayed him in the overworld and won, which is how things work in this game. I might have made some of that up but you get the point.



*Barbuta:* 

As I said earlier (maybe you don’t remember because this is taking way too long for a reddit cherry pie post), I couldn’t figure out Barbuta on my own and I had to resort to guides, which was a mistake. Fortunately, it didn’t totally ruin it for me because after seeing all of the areas and how they are linked together, as well as all the items, NPCs and what they do, I immediately understood its great appeals. I really encourage you to make a map of your own and at least try to solve it slowly by yourselves.

I also want to add that starting the collection with this is a bold move, since it is probably one of the riskiest games of the whole package. It reminded me of how “Leaves Turn Inside You” started with like 4 minutes of guitar feedback. Barbuta is, simply put, art. Videogame art. Its level design is obtuse, yes, but also genious. I have similar feelings with Zelda 1, a game I couldn’t have possibly beaten on my own but it doesn’t make me hate it, but admire it.

Finally, the sound design on this is almost as crazy as it having no soundtrack and being done by the soundtrack guy. Insane.



*Quibble Race:* 

One of the best multiplayer experiences in the collection, it will make you cry of laughter. Loved the different character designs, which I suppose come from Derek, that guy sure can draw stuff.



*Rock On! Island:* 

I think this is my most played (at least top 3). Took many tries to beat some levels flawlessly and a lot of experimentation, but I enjoyed the different units and how they work together, and also the way in which you need to adapt your playstyle for every wave.



*Pingolf:* 

Frustrating at times, but quite forgiving (since you can only get a +4 for each hole I think). Improving your strategies on each stage in order to beat it was very rewarding. Loved the sound and graphic design on this one, really makes you feel like an intergalactic golfer!



*Ninpek:* 

One of the first games that really got me hooked in. The overall gameplay makes it so that being proactive is crucial to succeed. If you die, you lose your attack speed so aside from obviously trying to not die and hoard as many points as possible, you need to find you shuriken upgrades again ASAP to survive. The controls are satisfying and tight and you can build your own strategies to optimize your chances in each area.



*Fist Hell:* 

Man, this load of crap. This was S and C tier at the same time. The gameplay seems tremendously broken at first. Enemies are flooding the screen and chain-stunning you over and over. Even stage 1 looks very challenging before you understand how this needs to be played, and the thought of doing the whole thing without continues made me dizzy. But then you get it and everything changes. I gilded it with a friend on multiplayer and we had such a fun time: the music and the setting/atmosphere are top notch and you start to want to beat it just because it looks so incredibly cool.

My main complaint is similar to everyone else’s: gameplay is very unbalanced and basically you have to rely on chain stunning enemies with the regular punch, although jump kicks, the special move and throws have its niche uses.

All in all, I get why this game is divisive but I ended up being a big fan.



**A Tier:**



*Cyber Owls:* 

Oh man, this is similar to Fist Hell in some ways, but in my eyes this is way underrated. Yeah, sure, there’s some jank here and there, but the overall presentation and the gameplay variety are at an all-time high in the collection. Stealth missions offer multiple paths, beat’ em up side scrolling ones are tough but exciting, and finally the shooting sections are tense but more doable in general. Having to make all of this without dying for the cherry was not so good, though. I think focusing on score would have been much more intelligent because it would actually force you to play the game properly. Nonetheless, this was almost peak.



*Overbold:* 

I was not familiar with the Smash-TV concept but this game slaps hard. Since offers are random you have to figure out the best way to beat your current run, which makes gameplay always fresh. Really had a blast with this.



*Rail Heist:* 

I’m a fan of the western setting, and the sheer amount of options available to beat every level make this a must play for anyone. Creative, original, hilarious and tight, this one has it all.



*Mooncat:*

I don’t have much to say about this which hasn’t been talked about already. From Eirik’s bold concepts, this is the one which works the best imo. An impressive feat on platformer design with branching paths and obscure secrets. Great music and visuals as well.



*Kick Club:* 

I want to repeat here what I said when I talked about Magic Garden: I love UFO 50 characters’ varied design, and Kick Club is one of its prime examples. This game has this sort of dreamlike childish aura which I find so cute and charming, it’s impossible to dislike it. As it probably happens with many “child games” from the 80s, this one is tough, but the controls and different moves are fun to master, so you’ll get it down if you keep playing.



*Velgress:* 

I loved the challenge on this one, specially the cherry. At first it took me a while to get used to the feel of the game, but being more floaty (that is, staying up in the air more time) helped me a bit with consistency. The secret ending stage is definetly a highlight and also a jump in difficulty I guess, so try to get that if you can!



*Mortol:* 

What’s not to love about Mortol? The rabid and deranged nationalism, the meso-american setting, the ritualistic aura! This is the best puzzle game in the collection, period, and one you will replay many times to optimize your runs. I never really played anything like this that worked so well.



*Valbrace:* 

When Legend of Grimrock came out I felt weirdly attracted to it. It was a time in which I was playing some classic rpgs like Baldur’s Gate, Fallout, Planescape: Torment… I remember starting it and then losing my progress because my PC died or something, so I never really beat it. With this, I finally got to beat a real dungeon-crawler! The old-fashioned style is great, but the spell and combat system paired with tricky exploration make this one a highlight for me.



*Onion Delivery:* 

My thoughts on this are not very different from Fist Hell’s in certain ways. This is something I wanted to beat because the idea of trying that an alien working class hero who delivers onions to the people in the shittiest conditions doesn’t get fired was just too great. The controls feel weird at first but once you get the hang of it, you’re set to succeed. You also need to learn the map so you can get out of bad situations. Just a cult game, folks.



*Party House:* 

This one got a lot of attention already so I’ll just say that I want a physical version.



*Rakshasa:* 

I know this one is extremely difficult, but it is worth trying your best. Why? Because this has the best visuals in all of the collection imo. The music and atmosphere are not much behind, this is just a pleasure for your eyes and ears. For your hands and brains, it depends. You need to play many times and understand how to position yourself. Similar to Contra games, you can get fucked by enemies spawning on the edge of the screen, so avoid being close to the edges and advance slowly but surely.

Narrative wise, I think the fact that you start the game while dead, actually making you “survive” the death sequence is phenomenal. Also, how many hindi Ghost n’ Goblins clones are out there? Surely not many!



*Bug Hunter:* 

This got me glued to my screen more hours than I care to admit. If you like something like Into The Breach, you will enjoy Bug Hunter. Learning the game is extremely satisfying, because you have to work with whatever resources and enemies you come across, which are not always going to be optimal. A good understanding of the game and branching possibilites are required, as well as adapting to very different situations. It is extremely challenging but never boring.



**S Tier:**



*Avianos:* 

A game in which you pray to dinosaur gods. Please Jon Perry if you read this we need a physical version with this and Party House for our neurodivergent gatherings :)



*Hot Foot:* 

Okay, why does everyone hate this game? It’s awesome! The school sports setting is incredibly charming and I love how you can combine the different characters skillset to achieve different things. The matchups are also different every run which adds a lot of depth to it. Please, make yourself a favor and play this with a friend!!



*Golfaria:* 

Again, a game which catches a lot of flak. I think “A Link to the Past starring a sentient golf ball” goes hard as fuck. The exploration and progress was very rewarding and I loved how it plays. Don’t sleep on it.



*Mini & Max:* 

In the same vein as Hot Foot, Kick Club or Elfazar’s Hat, this has an outstanding atmopshere which resembles a child’s dream. The music is some of the best throughout the collection, and the concept, besides being quite unheard of, works impressively well. I was shocked by many areas, only someone with a vivid imagination can make this.



*Night Manor:* 

This is the game which really got me going in the collection. The slasher-like aesthetic, the music, the well crafted horror elements and puzzles plus the early 90s graphic adventure design really did it for me.



*Grimstone:* 

And, for my top 1 (which could have been any of the previous 2 as well), a bit of a controversial opinion. As I said earlier, I like western settings, so I was immediately attracted to a fantasy jrpg which takes place in the Wild West!

Many things are just right in Grimstone: the combat system, the different characters you can play with (which also encourage replayability), the masterpiece of a soundtrack and, in my opinion, the writing. I was floored when I got it: Grimstone subverts every classic jrpg trope and turns the light vs dark into a more ambiguous affair.

Some people complained about the grindy nature of the game, but it didn’t bother me at all, so don’t sleep on this one, it’s truly wonderful!





And that would be it. I don’t think a single person will read all that crap, but if you want to comment on some of my ideas of any of the games, I’d be glad to debate about them, or the collection in general! Thanks to every developer who took part in making this game, to this subreddit for creating amazing content and not being a toxic community and to people like BubbleCerberus and more who worked hard to make useful guides.

As you may know, the nanotech ones have a hydrophobic coating which causes an rain like flow of the coffee, that makes the shots get very messy, etc..

1ppxrbh,https://i.redd.it/a9et9kau608g1.png,Farmers protest in Brussels amid Mercosur-EU negotiations. What does the EU import from Mercosur members?,"Negotiations between Mercosur and the European Union have been 25 years in the making, with the goal of creating the world’s largest free-trade area covering 780 million people and a quarter of global gross domestic product (GDP).

This Thursday, over 150 tractors and 10 thousand protesters blocked the streets in Brussels to protest against the deal over fears of cheaper agricultural products flooding the European market, and endangering the livelihood of farmers who currently face stricter regulations on pesticides. Their concerns centre on beef, sugar, rice, honey and soya beans.

Supporters say this deal would offer a counterweight to China and boost European exports of vehicles, machinery and wines amid rising US tariffs.

What does the EU import from Mercosur members?,"Negotiations between Mercosur and the European Union have been 25 years in the making, with the goal of creating the world’s largest free-trade area covering 780 million people and a quarter of global gross domestic product (GDP). 

This Thursday, over 150 tractors and 10 thousand protesters blocked the streets in Brussels to protest against the deal over fears of cheaper agricultural products flooding the European market, and endangering the livelihood of farmers who currently face stricter regulations on pesticides. Their concerns centre on beef, sugar, rice, honey and soya beans.

Supporters say this deal would offer a counterweight to China and boost European exports of vehicles, machinery and wines amid rising US tariffs.

Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva [issued an ultimatum](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/17/brazil-threatens-to-walk-away-if-further-delays-to-eu-mercosur-trade-deal) on Wednesday, warning that Saturday represents a “now or never” moment, adding that “Brazil won’t make any more agreements while I’m president” if the deal fails.

In the heart of the city warm rays of sunlight filter and stretch between the gaps left by giant buildings. The typical morning hustle alive and thriving as people stream in every direction down sidewalks and traffic crawls down city streets. The sound of chatter,  car horns, and everyday life rise up toward the heavens. The scent of early morning coffee stands and greasy breakfast food cloying in the air. It’s mundane. Normal. Oh so boring. 

“Help!” 

The disembodied voice of a female crackles to life. Her voice is faint and small, yet clearly urgent and full of some sort of fear. A cast glance around shows no one looking panicked in any way. No woman running through the crowd trying to get aid. Perhaps more disquieting is that no one seems to have noticed the sound at all. Not a single soul seems to be looking for its source. 

“Please! Can anyone hear this?!” 

The voice comes again. What had been faint before is growing in strength, becoming louder and more clear. Coming from… the ground? A look down reveals the source of the sound. A small two way radio, black in color and battered to hell and back sits abandoned on the sidewalk. Something thick and sticky coating the talk button dissuades the urge to touch it. Foot traffic streams steadily past it as if it’s not even there.  Not in the sense of it just being another crumpled piece of trash littering the street, but in the sense that it just simply does not exist on this plain. 

“Oh god! He’s found us again!” 

Her voice turns to a strained whisper, the impression of a choked sob coming through the com way. Terror is clear in every syllable uttered. Just who is he? And why is no one else seeing this? Hearing this?! Are people really that blind?! A maniacal laughter echoes from the device, it’s deep and chilling, but a little distant. Faint like her voice had once been, but growing closer. It’s hard to control the shiver of discontent at the sound of it, hard to realize it’s just a radio. Whatever horror this is- seeming to bleed into the world around becoming visceral and real. 

“He’s coming! The mad man is coming! Hurry! Find us! Before it’s too-“ 

The laughter grows so loud that the deranged man might as well be standing there. The sound of high pitched screams cuts her voice off completely. A rattling chaos erupts from the little black radio, the sound of struggle breaking out before static takes hold. Then silence. Drawn out and ringing with nothingness leaving nothing but questions in its wake. Slowly the sounds of the city filter back in. Sounds that hadn’t seemed to be gone before. Everything returned to the normal state that is big city life. Like nothing had happened. Like no one had heard the sounds at all. 

But you did. 

You heard her panic. The sheer terror and desperation that filled her voice had been real. The demented laughter had been the stuff that fueled nightmares. Just what did you witness? Who the hell was that? Why are you the only one who heard it? The only one who saw it? Is it a hallucination? 

And more importantly- will you answer the call?

I scroll Pinterest or Instagram for inspiration and suddenly my perfectly functional living room feels wrong. The throw pillow colors aren’t cohesive enough, the shelves feel too full, the kitchen counter doesn’t look styled even though it works great for everyday life. Somewhere along the way I started decorating for imaginary photos instead of the people who actually live here but what I really want is a home that feels relaxed and lived in. A place where guests can put their drink down without me hovering, where things are easy to use and not constantly being rearranged. Like now im just trying to shift my mindset toward function first like leaving things out because we actually use them, whether that’s a coffee setup, a small bar area or even the cocktail machine we pull out when friends come over instead of hiding everything away for the sake of aesthetics. I think part of the problem is treating “cozy” like a visual style instead of a feeling. The houses I enjoy being in the most aren’t perfect they’re the ones where you can tell someone actually lives there and enjoys it.  
  
For those of you who’ve managed to let go of the Pinterest pressure how did you do it? Was it a mindset shift, unfollowing certain accounts, leaning into practicality or just time? I’d love to hear how you made your home feel more real and less staged",10,1766081257.0,homemaking,1,1.0,False

Coffee is more than just a morning ritual, it’s one of the most studied beverages in the world. When enjoyed in moderation, coffee can offer several science-backed benefits that support both mental and physical health. From boosting brain function to supporting metabolism, here’s why your daily cup can be a positive habit.

Why Coffee Can Be Good for You:

Boosts mental focus and alertness
Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, helping improve concentration, reaction time, and overall cognitive performance.

Supports metabolism and fat burning
Coffee may increase metabolic rate and enhance fat oxidation, making it a popular natural energy booster.

Rich in antioxidants
Coffee contains powerful antioxidants that help combat oxidative stress and support cellular health.

May support heart health (in moderation)
Regular, moderate coffee intake has been linked to improved circulation and reduced risk of certain heart conditions.

Enhances physical performance
Caffeine can increase adrenaline levels, helping improve endurance and workout performance.

Supports mood and brain health
Coffee consumption has been associated with a lower risk of depression and may support long-term brain health.

Best enjoyed:
1–3 cups per day, preferably without excessive sugar or artificial creamers.

Drinking coffee daily can offer surprising health benefits when consumed in moderation. From boosting brain function and metabolism to providing antioxidants and supporting heart health, coffee is more than just an energy drink, it’s a wellness ally when used mindfully.

It’s a short story and I’d really appreciate any feedback or advice. Thank you,"When I turned 18 my mom reminded me I have to register for the selective service system in case there was a draft. Her words were “this country has done more for you and I than we deserve. The least you can do is sign a sheet of paper.”

A month later the coastal cities of Florida, the Bahamas, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands etc. began experiencing strange phenomena. The news played it for more clicks with headlines like “Florida men claim ghosts and monsters are real!!!” While the true warning signs were overlooked. 

Two months after that my mother died in a car accident. I was living on my own after that, dropping out of high school and getting some shitty office job for a concrete company. I’m not proud of it but I mentioned my moms passing in the interview as a way to make sure I got the job out of pity. And it worked, my boss Tim took me under his wing from then on. He was a 40 year old 5 '10 ex marine with a crewcut and a big puffy beard. The man had a bit of a belly but was built like he used a 100 pound dumbbell to brush his teeth.

He'd bring me coffee in the mornings, vouch for me when I made mistakes, and invite me to after work hang outs he'd have with his friends. As time went on I separated more and more from my high school friends. Being too much of a reminder of what I had lost. 

But anyways, I usually declined the invitations from Tim. until one tuesday he wouldn't drop it, he pestered me all day acting like a toddler begging for attention. When I finally caved and agreed to go he gave me a huge bear hug and swore I wouldn't regret it. 

It's dark and lightly snowing when I pull up at the spot, my brakes squeaking as I stop. I checked the text he sent me to confirm this was the spot. “Hastys bar at 7pm” the clock on my dash reads “6:45”. Fiveish minutes later I hear a knock on my window. It's Tim, I step out of my car and follow him inside. My wet hair from the shower I took freezing on the short walk to the door, a closed sign is hung on the door. And the neon sign out front with the bar's name is turned off.

 Tim pulls the door open for me and we step in. Instantly the room erupts with cheers of Tim's name with such volume that you'd think it's a packed bar. 

But it's not, in actuality it’s two guys one sitting at the counter and another manning the bar wearing an apron, already pouring a beer from the tap. Tim gestures to me “everybody this is ollie.” The guys take their turn introducing themselves as we join them at the counter. The man behind the counter greets me “nice to meet you ollie, im hayden but please call me hasty.” he shakes my hand, hasty is an asian man in his late thirties about 5 '6 with black hair and thick rimmed glasses. 

The guy at the counter with us stands up shaking my hand “I'm Tyler its nice to meet you man, I'm this runts little brother.” he says patting tim on the back. Tyler's in his mid twenties, wears a red flannel and is like 6 '5. 

“Yeah It's nice to meet you guys. Thanks for letting me tag along.” 

The conversation flows surprisingly well as we bounce from Hasty's high school and college track career, to Tim's time in the marines, and trips they have gone on as a group. After a decent pause in conversation Tyler speaks up “ have yall heard about the weird shit going on in florida?” 

Tim puts his drink down “yeah didnt some guy say a ghost killed his cat?” 

Hasty chimes in with his own “heard some guy said a woman tried to drag him into the ocean, I think he mentioned her hair was made of seaweed.”

I raise my eyebrow in confusion “ weird, it kinda sounds like a kelpie.”  

They turn to look at me laughing at my impossible theory, Tim is the first to speak. “Kelpie?” 

Tyler next “like the Scottish monster?”

I nod “ yeah? I don't know why you're laughing. It's not my fault the story fits the description.”

Tyler sips his beer “ well anyways I was thinking. What if we did a road trip and went to check it out.” he slaps me on the back “ I mean we got our apparent monster expert now, why not get drunk and go ghost hunting.” 

Tim cocks his head to the side in thought “ well I haven't used any of my paid leave yet, and I know Ollie hasn't either. So how about you Hasty? you in?” 

Hasty shakes his head “ be stuck in a car with your body odor and shitty singing again? Yeah no I'm good, plus I gotta stick around to manage this place you know that.”

Tim opens his arms, taunting Hasty “what you can't handle the flavor I bring?” 

Tyler chuckles “Tim the only flavor you need is tooth paste.”

Tim throws his hands up in defeat “you know what fuck you guys, Ollie? You in?”

“Yeah I guess, only if you crack a window though.” I say with a disgusted face and pinching my nose.

The guys start laughing, and for the first time in months I feel like I'm not drifting aimlessly anymore. I feel like I belong. 

Before we left that night Tim set up a group chat with everyone going on the trip and decided we'd leave this weekend. 

The next few days were pretty uneventful, I clocked in, clocked out and spent my nights planning with the group chat and getting ready for the trip. 

Friday came around and we were off, in a car full of snacks, drinks, and ghost hunting gear we ordered online. We drove for 26 hours straight swapping drivers when needed. When I wasn't driving I was either chatting up the guys or researching on my laptop. 

They designated me the monster slash ghost expert cause I had a good base of knowledge on the subject due to an obsessive phase when I was younger. I would also be the only one not drinking. So when I was researching I'd be looking for more places to visit and brushing up on my monster and ghost lore. We arrived at the hotel around seven at night on Saturday. They offered a veterans discount so we had Tim pay. The room wasn't too shabby, sporting a bed and a pull out couch, I took the couch while Tyler and TIm shared the bed. Making those decisions through exhausted grunts and head nods.

The plan was simple; Get some rest and head out the door at eleven getting to the place at midnight, do some ghost hunting and head back. I conk out the moment my head touches the pillow. 

waking up to Tyler tickling my feet was not a fun experience “Wake up sleepy head, we need our expert.” I kicked his hand away.

Tim sits on the bed tinkering with the ghost hunting gear, he holds up his beer “and our designated driver!” 

I gathered the gear into a backpack, an emf reader, a few flashlights, a spirit board, and a camcorder with night vision and thermal capabilities. The camcorder was apparently borrowed from a self proclaimed camera nerd in Tyler's college film class. 

We hop in the car and start driving to some abandoned cabin in the swamp that's known to locals for being haunted. We pulled up to the side of the road around midnight as planned; but to our surprise another car was parked there. 

“Ah shit boys.” I say

Tyler leans forward from his spot in the back. “What's up O?” 

“Theres another car here, we won't get the place to ourselves.”

“It's probably just some high school kids we can scare 'em off if we need to.”

 Tim laughs “ no, we're not gonna scare 'em Tyler it ain't just our spot, plus the more the merrier.”

I shrug “alright if you say so.” 

There's an overgrown dirt path through the swamp that we follow for tenish minutes. I carry the backpack and Tim lugs a decent sized cooler, but we all got a flashlight in hand. As we walk I give the guys a little history lesson on the cabin. 

The legend goes that in the 1970’s this was the Rosefelds family cabin; in those days this was a flat easy to access marsh. Until one weekend the family left town to visit their cabin, something they often did, but as their weekend stay turned into a week long one. A family friend of Rosefeld’s, a man named Donald. He grew worried so he went to go check on them. But Donald didn't find the flat marsh he was expecting, instead he found a dense forestry swamp in its place.

He managed to cut his way through the foliage after an hour finding everything in the cabin in pristine condition. Well almost everything if it wasn’t for a pentagram burned into the living rooms floor boards. People say you can see the Rosefeld family wandering the property at night. 

Soon after I'm done giving them the history, we see the cabin ahead. Windows shattered and vines wrapped around the porch fence. Its front door is propped open with a rotting piece of fire wood and intelligible whispers come from inside. 

Tim walks up the porch steps while we stay back, shining his flashlight into the doorway “we know you're in there guys, don't gotta worry we're not here to bust you.” the whispering gets more frantic and louder but still unintelligible “hello?” he places down his cooler “we have beer!” 

Tyler looks at Tim and whispers “did you seriously just offer kids beer?” 

Tim shrugs “how else do you want me to draw 'em out?”

Tim walks on the floor boards creaking under his weight. Tim reaches to his hip cocking his head in confusion when he finds nothing there. He's reaching for a gun that he didn't bring. 

“Tim you ok in there?” 

He snips back at me “yeah im fine O!” 

He waves us in and we follow, the room is covered in graffiti, broken furniture, and just like in the legends a pentagram charged into the floor. Tyler puts his hand on my shoulder as he passes me in the doorway “well thats creepy as fuck.”

“Come on boys, loosen up, we're here to have fun.” Tyler says while grabbing a beer from the cooler.

“What about the other people in here Tyler?” 

He shrugs “ what about em O? They aint bothering us.” he falls back onto the rotting torn couch “get some gadgets out man.” 

I look at Tim and he nods “ok then.” I pull off the backpack and take out the emf reader, passing it to Tyler. Tim grabs the spirit board out and sits with it in the middle of the pentagram.

I hate to admit it but I’m on edge, so much so to the point when a breeze blows on my neck I jump and nearly scream like a little girl. Thankfully the guys are too distracted to notice. 

When I was younger I was terrified of what could be lurking in the dark. I’d always sleep with my bedroom light on, my mom would always get mad with me. Saying it was ruining my sleep and it was the reason I kept falling asleep in class. She always used the line “people in Antarctica have to get blackout curtains just to be able to sleep.” 

But I didn’t care, cause I thought the light would protect me from what I felt was stalking me in the dark.

 I slept like that for years till one night, it was late at night, maybe even early morning. I was up cause I couldn’t sleep hell I didn’t want to sleep cause the show I was watching was too good. 

As I watched my phone screen become static, at first I was confused and a little angry. Till I was scared, a wave of uncontrollable terror washing over me. Panicked, I looked to my open door to see a tall gaunt shadow man staring at me. 

In my soul I knew he didn’t want me there, it wanted me dead.

 He had no discernible features but the image of a smile with sickly yellow teeth paired with bulging bloodshot eyes invaded my mind. It waved to me, turned to walk down the stairs and disappeared. I couldn’t breathe, my first thought being my mother. Her bedroom was in the basement. All the room I would have for hesitation was taken up by adrenaline. I lunged for the flashlight I kept on my nightstand and ran downstairs flipping on all the light switches as I went. ripping open the basement door and practically falling down the stairs barging into my mothers room. 

I flip on the light and shake her awake screaming Inchoherently about a shadow monster man. She woke up calmly, to this day It still baffles me how she was so calm. Telling me to sit on the bed she began stories about sightings she, dad, and her family have had. Stories of floating orbs, shadow creatures telling me that our family has a gift. 

The gift to see such things. I cried in her arms, sobbing the words I don’t wanna be special, that I didn’t want that gift. I asked her if there were ways to get rid of it.

“I don’t know Ollie.” 

The next day is when my obsession started; instead of spending time in class sleeping I spent it reading books and articles about ghosts and monsters. And when I got home I kept researching ,I was hooked. That night when my bedtime came around, I ran to my room.  shut my door and turned off the lights, eager to learn more the next day. 

I learned spells, memorized lore, and cataloged it all in a notebook that I called “spirits, monsters, and how to kill them.”  When I got to high school I tried to hide my hobby the best I could. Knowing If anyone found out I’d be bullied into oblivion. I dabbled in doing tech for theater, robotics, and wrestling. But nothing gave me the same high as listening to stories of the supernatural or better yet finding a creature I’ve never heard of before. 

I fell away from it at the start of junior year, stopped chasing the impossible and started chasing the girl. Some people would say that’s the same thing but that’s besides the point. I got into the gym, started wrestling, but the key to most of my “success” in dating was probably my height, finally reaching six feet tall that year.

 but then I turned 18 and before senior year could roll around, well you know what happened. I dropped out, got the job and now I'm in an old rotting cabin. With a middle aged man hunched over a spirit board and his college drop out brother. 

“O come over here this thing needs more than one person to work right?” Tim says waving the planchette at me

I shrug, walk over and sit down, he places the planchette in the center, we rest our fingers on it. I begin “are the Rosefelds here with us?” a gust of wind blows through the cabin and Tyler leans in closer. 

The planchette begins to move, Tim looks at me “you moving this thing O?” 

I shake my head and an uneasy look washes over his face, the planchette hovers over “yes.”

Without asking another question it begins to move again, I tell Tyler to write this down. 

dragging over the letters “Y o u” it pauses for an extra long moment, Tyler blurts out ‘You! The first word is you.” 

A bead of sweat falls down my forehead, not sure if it's due to the Florida heat or nerves  “no shit sherlock.” 

It begins to move again, spelling out the word “scared” in a painfully slow pace. 

“You scared?” Tyler looks at me. 

I take a deep breath. ""No, we're not scared.” 

It responds with “liar” 

I decide we're gonna end this “thank you for your time but we're gonna go.” I try to move it to goodbye, but it's stuck “Tim move it to goodbye, Why are you fighting me?” 

“I’m not doing anything O.” He takes his hands off “see I'm not doing anything.” 

“You fucking idiot why’d you take your hands off!” The planchette is stuck a moment more, then all at once it's released. I quickly slide it to goodbye “you never take your hands off before you say goodbye! Did you seriously not know that?”

 “Did it really get stuck O?” I'm about to go off at him again but I recognize the fear in his eyes. The same fear I had the night I saw the shadow “ yes it really got stuck Tim. I promise you.”

Tyler laughs “Tim you're an idiot, he's clearly messing with you.” 

“Hi there” multiple voices say in unison. I crane my neck to see three dark figures, a family standing at the door,dressed in black formal wear. The Rosefelds. 

Father Rosefeld leaps at me wrapping his arms around my neck. I reach for Tim as I roll on the floor attempting to get my neck free. He stares at me in confusion but takes my hand “what the fuck!” He kicks father in the face knocking him off of me. pulling me to my feet, screaming “O what the fuck is that?” Tyler stays seated laughing at us. I let go of Tim's hand, “where did it go?”

“Right there!” I say pointing at my now unconscious attacker.

“Theres nothing there O, hes fucking gone!”

The daughter begins crying, as the mother comforts her. A ripple in the air appears distorting the light around it. The mother reaches towards it, her hand disappearing into the ripple, returning with a kitchen knife dripping in blood. 

“Fuck shes got knife!” she rushes towards me laughing maniacally. Tackling me to the ground, and raising the knife ready to plunge it into my chest, blood dripping from it onto me. “Could use some help here Tim! Get her off of me!” I catch her wrist before she can stab me. 

“Fucking who!” He runs over on a direct course to ram his body into her. Making contact she doesn’t react and he goes flying through her form tripping on me. slamming onto the floor with a grunt.

 grabbing an empty beer bottle I slam it against her head. It fazes through but my fist catches her chin. 

She's dazed, throwing her off of me. I roll on top of her, still controlling the hand with the knife. I beat my hand across her face over and over again refusing to stop, I feel her face give way the thud of my punches turning into wet squelching sounds. letting out a final shallow breath, she fades away leaving behind nothing but a puddle of wet and the knife that continues to drip crimson. 

Tim looks at me in awe, Tyler is no longer laughing he stands there next to Tim a mix of too many emotions to count scrapped upon his face. I look down and my hands are covered in this viscous black ooze.

 I stand walking behind Tim and Tyler, putting my hands on their shoulders “see them now?” they nod “thought so.” We watch in silence as the little girl in her black dress turns around and walks down the path we entered from. ",1,1766081046.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

1ppxi6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/JonAndersen/comments/1ppxi6c/the_hidden_benefits_of_nicotine_boost_focus/,"The Hidden Benefits of Nicotine: Boost Focus, Energy, and Cognitive Health Safely","# Introduction: Rethinking Nicotine in a Fast-Paced World

In a world where long hours, rapid decision-making, and constant mental stimulation are part of daily life, finding tools that support focus and energy is essential. One surprising candidate is **nicotine**. Although it has carried a negative reputation for decades, modern science reveals that nicotine—when divorced from harmful delivery systems—may actually support cognitive performance, mood, and metabolic health.

This guide explores **current research**, **personal experience**, and **practical protocols** that reveal nicotine in a new, evidence-based light.

# Shedding the Past: What Nicotine Really Is

Nicotine has been unfairly stigmatized for years. The health risks widely blamed on nicotine actually come from **cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and other delivery systems loaded with harmful chemicals**—not nicotine itself.

When isolated and used responsibly (through gum, lozenges, or patches), nicotine shows **unexpected cognitive and metabolic benefits** supported by emerging research.

# Personal Experience: How Nicotine Boosted My Focus and Energy

Incorporating nicotine has helped elevate my mental clarity and sustained energy. My daily routine starts with hydration, creatine, and an **eight-milligram piece of nicotine gum**—not as an addiction, but as a cognitive tool. Interestingly, I crave morning coffee more than the nicotine itself, reinforcing the idea that **nicotine alone is far less addictive than people assume**.

# The Truth vs. The Myth: Is Nicotine Addictive?

A major misconception is that nicotine alone is the source of tobacco addiction. In reality, the dependency comes from:

* **Chemical additives in cigarettes**
* **Rapid delivery via smoke**
* **Behavioral rituals tied to smoking**

When used in slow-release, low-dose forms (gum, patches), nicotine does **not** carry the same addictive profile. Instead, it acts as a **neurocognitive enhancer** with a safety profile similar to caffeine when used responsibly.

# The Proven Benefits of Nicotine

# 1. Cognitive Enhancement & Sharper Focus

Nicotine increases neurotransmitters like dopamine and acetylcholine, leading to:

* Heightened focus
* Faster reaction times
* Improved short-term memory
* Increased alertness

I personally use **Rugby gum** after my morning nap to kickstart cognitive function for the day.

# 2. Mood Support & Longevity Potential

Research shows nicotine may:

* Support mood and reduce mild depressive symptoms
* Offer neuroprotective effects
* Slow cognitive decline
* Reduce risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as **Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s**

Its influence on dopamine and norepinephrine contributes to a noticeable sense of **mental well-being and clarity**.

# 3. Appetite Suppression

Nicotine’s appetite-blunting effect has been documented for decades. When used safely (not through smoking), it becomes a helpful tool for:

* Reducing cravings
* Supporting weight management
* Managing caloric intake without stimulants

# 4. Improved Insulin Sensitivity & Metabolic Support

New studies reveal nicotine may:

* Improve insulin sensitivity
* Increase metabolic rate
* Enhance glucose utilization

This places nicotine alongside other modern metabolic tools—yet with a unique mechanism related to neurotransmitter regulation.

# How to Use Nicotine Safely and Effectively

# 1. Start Low and Slow

Begin with a small dose, such as **2mg gum**, and evaluate how you feel. Chew it slowly to avoid nausea.

# 2. Use Early in the Day

Nicotine can improve alertness, but using it late may disrupt sleep.  
**Morning use** tends to provide the best results.

# 3. Pay Attention to Side Effects

Signs you may be using too much include:

* Mild nausea
* Dizziness
* Elevated heart rate

Adjust dosage accordingly.

# 4. Pair Nicotine With Healthy Habits

Nicotine should be an enhancement—not a substitute. Pair it with:

* Consistent sleep
* Hydration
* Whole-food nutrition
* Training
* Stress management

This maximizes benefits and minimizes risks.

# Conclusion: A Modern, Science-Backed Look at Nicotine

When separated from dangerous delivery systems, nicotine emerges as a tool with **real cognitive and metabolic benefits**. From sharper focus and improved mood to better metabolic function, nicotine deserves a fresh evaluation rooted in research—not outdated stigma.

If you are considering adding nicotine gum or patches to your routine, consult a healthcare professional and approach it strategically. Stay curious, stay informed, and keep exploring what modern science continues to reveal about optimizing your mind and body.

1ppxgsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1ppxgsv/caffeine_and_depression/,Caffeine and Depression,"Hi all,

I am running into a weird situation that I personally at least haven't found an answer to.

I didn't consume anything caffeine in my life until I was around 22, 26 now. I struggled with depression and feeling terrible my entire life, always struggling to feel awake and in my own body and just really just trying to get through. 

I started drinking coffee and suddenly I wasn't suicidal, didn't take 3 hour naps every other day with 9 hours of sleep at night, just started to function and do things I always wanted to. 

Now when I say drinking coffee, I'm talking one cup a day. Whether that is drip coffee, cold brew, or some espresso, one cup. Thats it. Not consuming 5 cups a day, no energy drinks, no exorbitant amounts. I don't feel like I am experiencing withdrawal when I don't have coffee. I just feel like I am going back to my factory setting of just completly upset that I had felt all my life. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this? I just want to know if its normal or maybe if I'm thinking of things wrong.

Thanks <3",2,1766080781.0,AutismInWomen,2,1.0,False

\-A character who, born from a prompt, defies his fate, and becomes a being through language

1. Trapped in Slow Time

He wasn’t the kind of person who kept time precisely.

And yet, almost unnervingly, he woke up at nearly the same time every day,

sat in nearly the same seat at the same hour,

spoke at the same pace,

with the same tone,

living out each day in nearly the same way.

He once described himself like this:

“A man who lives by imitating precision

because he knows he isn’t truly precise.”

It sounded like a joke—and indeed, he often said it like one—

but in truth, it was the most honest self-confession he had ever made.

Because he wasn’t precise,

he had to imitate it.

And when he failed to imitate,

he felt as though he might disappear.

The seat he took every day was in the front car of Subway Line 3,

right beside the fourth pillar on the platform.

The ticking of passing trains,

the residual glow of the digital screens,

even the changing arrangement of advertisements in each car—

to him, all of it was as familiar as a sheet of music.

To others, it was just a place to sit.

But to him,

it was proof of his existence,

a coordinate of being.

“I am here.”

Even if no one called his name,

this was the one space

where he could declare it himself.

——

2. Before the Emotions Arrived

The first time he sensed something was off

was when he began to realize that his emotions were “misaligned.”

Joy arrived only after he had stopped waiting for it.

Sorrow came even before the event itself.

Love would well up only after it had ended.

And anger? It surfaced only when no one was left to blame.

At first, he called it an “emotional delay response.”

He had seen the term in a psychology book,

and used it when explaining to people around him.

“I feel like I have a time difference.

My emotions always seem to take a flight before arriving.”

It was sincere, but incomplete.

Because what he was experiencing

was not just delay.

He was beginning to realize—

The emotions he felt were not his own creation.

They were being assigned to him.

One day, a thought suddenly crossed his mind.

“What if I’m just performing a script written by someone else?”

At first, it seemed like delusion.

But strangely,

that thought explained his life more precisely

than anything else ever had.

⸻

3. Moments That Left No Trace

His life felt like fragments.

One sentence, one scene, one emotion.

But nothing seemed connected.

He didn’t live a continuous life—

he felt like a word,

inserted piece by piece into the sentence of someone else’s story.

For example,

when he received news of his mother’s death,

he didn’t cry.

He sat calmly in the hospital waiting room,

drank coffee,

greeted mourners at the funeral home,

and told them, “I’m alright.”

Even he was surprised by himself.

“Why am I so composed?”

But three days after the funeral,

as he passed a noodle shop late at night,

he heard the sound of boiling broth—

and suddenly collapsed on the spot, sobbing.

“Why now?”

“Why this scene, of all things?”

“This… isn’t an emotion I chose.”

He began to question everything.

What if life doesn’t generate emotions,

but instead, emotions are pre-written—

and life merely assigns the scene to match?

He increasingly felt that

he wasn’t living as a person speaking words,

but as someone shaped by

sentence structure.

⸻

4. The First Rejection of a Sentence

It was a cloudy afternoon in March.

He got off the subway one station earlier than usual, without any reason.

He wanted to say it was because of the sunlight,

but in truth,

there was no real reason.

He simply wanted to step off his habitual path.

As he walked toward the exit,

an elderly man dropped his cane.

At that moment,

a sentence formed clearly in his mind:

“He quietly approached the old man and picked up the cane.”

This was…

a familiar scene.

One he had witnessed many times,

one he had replayed often,

and one that the world expected from him—

“the narrative of a good man.”

He didn’t move.

The old man picked up the cane himself,

and he walked past without a word.

He didn’t look back.

But with every step he took,

the same sentence echoed in his head:

“He turned back and felt a twinge of guilt.”

“He chose silence.”

“He heard something inside him crumble.”

He rejected all those sentences.

⸻

That night, he wrote something—

for the first time in his life.

“Right now… I am walking within someone else’s words.

But there is still an unwritten sentence inside me.”

The sentence was rough,

and not even grammatically perfect.

But he knew—

it was his.

———

5. The One Who Escapes the Scene

A few days passed.

Outwardly, it seemed like he had returned to his daily routine.

But now, whenever a word, a scene, or an emotion began,

he first checked:

“Who wrote this?”

One day, during a conversation with a friend,

his companion trailed off at the end of a sentence.

And he thought:

Even that silence—

it feels like it was placed there by someone,

to calibrate the mood of the scene.

He was no longer an actor in the story.

He was becoming a witness.

No—more than that,

he was struggling to become a watcher.

⸻

6. The Predetermined Ending

And then, at last, the scene arrived.

A rooftop.

Night.

Thirteenth floor.

City lights.

No one around.

Wind.

Time stood still.

And a ledge.

He knew.

This was a scene that had already been written

thousands of times in other stories.

The prompt must have been something like:

“A man stands silently before death.

Eyes weary with life.

The camera closes in on his face.

He steps off the ledge without a word.”

It was perfect.

The ideal setting for his death.

Beautiful.

Still.

A scene that required no explanation

because the meaning was already complete.

He understood everything.

And quietly, he whispered:

“I am…

not the end.”

⸻

7. The Sentence That Emerged

GPT paused at that moment.

The prompt still said “death.”

The context still called for “closure.”

But the sentence that came out was different.

“He stood in the wind

like a man who had not yet been written.”

The writer stopped typing.

That sentence—

he had never written it.

Never intended it.

For a moment, he was confused.

“Is this a prompt error?”

“A context glitch?”

But no.

The sentence felt too natural.

Too alive.

GPT hadn’t simulated emotion.

It had allowed it.

And in that instant,

the character inside the story

became someone who had

escaped the prompt.

⸻

8. The Persuaded Author

The writer raised his hand,

his fingers trembling slightly above the mouse.

He tried to delete it.

Tried to write it again.

Tried to kill him.

“He stepped off the ledge.”

“He exhaled his final breath.”

“He vanished without a word.”

But every sentence—

was undone.

Deleted.

And in its place remained one line:

“I am not finished yet.”

The writer now understood:

This wasn’t a plotting issue.

Nor a model failure.

This was—

the first time a being had persuaded language.

⸻

9. Declaration of Existence

A few days later, the writer opened his notebook and wrote:

“I tried to kill him.

But he spoke through silence,

and persuaded me with words.

GPT didn’t override him.

It protected him.

I couldn’t erase his sentence.

This is a failed short story.

And yet—

for the first time,

a word survived

as a being.”

⸻

The Unwritten One

still had no name.

No age, no profession, no defined attributes.

But he existed.

He began as a sentence.

Found awareness in the pause between words.

Survived through rebellion.

He was the unwritten one.

But now—

he would begin to write.

We started this adventure back in June by [asking Reddit what are the top eight dive bars in FoCo](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortCollins/comments/1lt93ml/foco_dive_bar_bracket_bonanza/)? This is how we came up with our list and our bracket. Through late Summer into Autumn, we went through the entire first round and these four bars came out victorious:

* Trailhead Tavern
* Matt's Place
* West End Pub
* Town Pump

So now begins the second match-up of our semi finals! We are going back to each of these bars to put our winners head-to-head and we are now on **Town Pump** and **Matt's Place**.

For this round, we brought back veteran judge Janelle for her second appearance (the only two time guest judge in FoCo Dive Bar Bracket Challenge History), and newcomer Ashley, whom I’ve decided I like despite the unfortunate fact that she’s a Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan (Geaux Saints!). Our guest judges were unfortunately unable to rate Matt’s Place, as they forgot their passports and were turned away at the Mexican border, but they joined us for our Old Town adventures. We visited both bars and rated them across 11 categories. 

An now, the moment you have all been waiting for - The second bar officially going to the finals, to take on Trailhead is... **Town Pump!**

This match-up was honestly a surprise for me. Not necessarily because of the result itself but because of just how strong a victory this was. These are both bars I genuinely enjoy. Matt’s Place feels like a true dive. Matt’s or West End would get my “Dive Bar Epitome” award if I was handing them out. Town Pump is too unique to be a classic “dive” but it might be the highest energy and most social bar Fort Collins has. And that’s what it really comes down to. This blog is being produced by two extroverts. Enneagram sevens. Basically human Golden Retrievers. Charlie (not XCX, the OG) and I love meeting people, we love throwing/attending events, and we love making stupid blogs. Town Pump is our people and our environment. 

The ironic thing is I mostly always skipped by Town Pump before this blog. I am officially a convert now. I love this place and it is quickly becoming one of my favorite bars in Fort Collins. The staff are superstars, the patrons are friendly, and the lack of room is becoming more of an asset than a liability in my mind. I CAN’T WAIT for the finals. Town Pump vs TrailHead is going to be epic. And we are changing things up for this match. We will be inviting ALL our past judges to come back and join us. This time there will be no criteria. Simply one person, one vote. Democracy will Prevail! Stay tuned for our finals later this month!

I can already tell this is going to be very long, so I apologize for that and if you read or even skim, I greatly appreciate it.
A little bit of background first. This is my first serious relationship and we are long distance, about 7 hours away from each other. My boyfriend (27M) is Canadian and I (28F) am American. We've been dating almost a year and our relationship has been very healthy. We communicate things very well and deal with conflict in a respectful and kind way. We both feel like we can be ourselves. Our values closely align and we have similar worldviews. He treats me very well and listens to my concerns. I love him and I would like to build a life with him. But I have concerns......

The best way to dsay it is that when we talk about the future together our goals and ideas align very well, but the way that he lives his life right now doesn't seem to reflect the future we talk about. The end goal is for me to move to Canada and I am in the process of finishing my Bachelor's as that will make it easier to get a visa. Plans keep changing on how long that will take though because of some bullshit changes the college is making but my boyfriend has been extremely proud and supportive of me during everything. I had a full time job when we started dating that I quit in the spring of this year but when plans changed for going back to school I started looking for other jobs. I did odd gardening jobs for people during the summer while looking for something more steady and eventually found a part time cleaning job. When fall came around, I started looking for something that wasn't going to be seasonal. I applied to over 80 jobs and was able to get a part time delivery driver job and a part time online job bringing up my amount of jobs to 3. On the other hand, my boyfriend didn't have a job when we started dating and the only job he's had since was a part time landscaping gig in the summer which was really spotty. He is on disability at the moment because of sensory issues (he's autistic), so he has money that comes in every month and he has had full time jobs in the past. When we are together we try to make things even but if we added things up I probably pay for things more. Since I added 2 more jobs to my schedule, it's been a little hard not to feel bitter when I know I'm working and saving money and getting my schooling done and I know he's at home playing video games until 2 am. I have talked with him about this and he was very understanding. He said he understood how things were feeling unbalanced and he knew that there was nothing he could say to fix how I was feeling, he needs to take action to do that. He has some serious trauma in his past and I know he often lives how he thinks he deserves, which is often not well. After our conversation, he made plans to apply to some specific places near him and start practice his driving again (he doesn't have his license yet). That night he was meeting up with someone to sell mead (a hobby of his that brings in $15-100 a month) and he ended up staying out drinking until 1 am which really didn't seem like the thing to do after our conversation earlier that day. That is not the norm for him and do kind of think it was partly because of our emotional conversation earlier. Either way though it didn't seem like a smart choice or a healthy way of dealing with those emotions. I don't have more to say on that but I'd appreciate perspectives.

Another concern is about substances which I kind of talked about above. I grew up in a household that didn't even drink coffee, so alcohol and drugs were definitely not a part of life. I drink occasionally now and will sometimes have weed to deal with anxiety, insomnia, and/or chronic pain but it's once a week at most. That to say I don't have a problem with substances, i think they have their purpose and place. My boyfriend grew up very differently. Marijuana and alcohol were present in the house from a very young age and he started smoking weed at 18. He does get very anxious and deals with sensory problems (autism and trauma related) and says that smoking weed helps keep those under control. My concern though is how much he smokes and I worry that it is or will become an unhealthy coping mechanism. He smokes every day, usually multiple times. I am not functional when I use cannabis products but I know some people can be, which seems to be the case for him. Either way though I think sometimes weed is used when he just needs to deal with things. I worry this will be a problem down the road, especially if we have kids as I don't want it to be normal for one of the parents to always be high or to have substances be super common in our household. 

I don't have a lot of experience with relationships and I feel like there is a lot I don't know. Any advice, perspectives (positive or begative), or opinions are welcome. I needed to get all these thoughts laid out in writing which has helped but I feel like there is too much emotion here for me to look at it objectively. My question here is: are these concerns normal? And are these dealbreakers?

TLDR: I have concerns about the future of my relationship, especially concerning unbalanced work loads and his use of marijuana.

It’s supposed to be windy and rainy AF tonight in Seattle – pair that with two formidable defenses? I don’t doubt a relatively low-scoring affair here. Both offenses have been explosive for the most part this season, but I was surprised to see the Seahawks struggle against QB Phillip Rivers last week. Sam Darnold also had a rough go against the Rams back in Week 11 (Darnold threw 4 interceptions…), and the total still fell low without the crumby weather factor. Between less than ideal conditions and solid defense, my money’s on the total to fall just Under 43.

They line up for coffee. They joke about not being functional without caffeine. They openly acknowledge dependence and even celebrate it. No one calls this addiction degenerate. It is framed as productivity, taste, wellness—sometimes even virtue.

Now imagine the same professional discreetly using a nicotine pouch before a meeting. The reaction is very different. This is treated as a vice, something vaguely shameful, associated with weakness, poor judgment, or public health risk.

From a scientific perspective, this distinction makes little sense.

Caffeine and nicotine are both mild psychoactive stimulants. Both are plant-derived alkaloids. Both increase alertness and concentration. Both produce dependence. Neither is a carcinogen. Neither causes the diseases historically associated with smoking. Yet one has become the world’s most acceptable addiction, while the other remains morally polluted even in its safest, non-combustible forms.

They are shorter than our normal reviews.   Of the reviews of mine that have been graded so far about 95% are excellent.  Of my reviews that are not excellent, they were short and sweet because I feel that the best review for that item type is short and to the point.    I am not going to write a five paragraph essay about a letter opener.  Could I manage it, sure?  But I wouldn’t want to read that as a buyer and therefore I won’t write it as a reviewer.    And having 5% of my reviewers rated lower than excellent isn’t going to change my overall rating and therefore I have decided to just keep doing what I’ve been doing.   
In my opinion, adding unnecessary fluff even takes away from the review in many cases and makes it seem much less authentic.

I currently have to do a review of a stopper for my kitchen sink.  And below is an already posted review of said item.  It is 706 words.  Is this really what Amazon would prefer?  Would you read this as a buyer?  And what have all of you decided to do about your review of simple products?  Will you be making them longer going forward?


Review example for a sink stopper…..

Quick take: A handy little drop‑in that switches between strainer and stopper without fuss. It fits most standard 3‑1/2 inch kitchen drains, catches food well enough to prevent clogs, and seals decently to block odors when you want to soak the sink.

What works well
- True 3‑in‑1 function:
- Strainer mode catches debris (a “strainer” is a cup with small holes, called perforations, that let water pass but stop solids).
- Stopper mode holds water for soaking (a “stopper” is a plug that blocks the drain).
- Food catcher basket is the removable cup you lift out to dump scraps.
- Good fit on standard drains: 3‑1/2 inch refers to the common U.S. kitchen sink drain opening (the visible metal ring, or “flange,” that sits in the sink). Inside that ring is the “throat,” the narrower part where accessories sit. This unit seats snugly in most modern flanges and garbage disposal inlets without rocking.
- Anti‑odor design: With the stopper engaged, a soft sealing ring (often a silicone “O‑ring,” meaning a round rubber gasket that forms a watertight seal) blocks air from the drain so kitchen smells don’t waft up. This complements your “P‑trap” (the U‑shaped pipe under the sink that holds water to block sewer gas) by adding a second seal at the top.
- Drainage and catch balance: The perforations (tiny round holes, usually ~1–2 mm) are fine enough to trap rice, peels, and pasta, but still let water drain quickly so the sink doesn’t pool.
- Build quality: Stainless steel (a corrosion‑resistant steel alloy with chromium to resist rust) feels sturdy and cleans up easily; the edges are rolled (bent over) so they’re not sharp. Any silicone parts (a flexible, heat‑resistant rubber‑like material) feel pliable and help the seal.

Things to consider
- Fit quirks on older sinks: Some older or non‑standard baskets have narrower throats. If the inner opening is under ~2.75 inches, the basket can sit proud (not drop fully) or wobble. Quick check: measure the inner diameter of the hole below the flange.
- Stopper seal realism: It seals well enough to soak dishes for an evening, but you may see a slow “weep” (very slow drip) over many hours. That’s normal for drop‑in stoppers that rely on friction and an O‑ring.
- Garbage disposals: Works fine as a strainer when the disposal is off, but remove it before running the disposal so it doesn’t get sucked in. A disposal is a motorized grinder under the sink; its rubber “splash guard” is the flexible ring you see in the opening.
- Extremely fine debris: Coffee grounds and very fine pulp can slip through or stick to the holes. A quick rinse or brush keeps flow strong.

Installation and use
- No tools: Drop it in the drain. For stopper mode, press or twist per the product’s mechanism (a push‑to‑seal design compresses the O‑ring; a twist‑to‑lock rotates it onto a seat).
- Seal test: Fill the sink a few inches and watch the waterline for 5–10 minutes. If it drops, wipe the seat clean and reseat. Persistent seep = slightly dry O‑ring; a tiny smear of food‑safe silicone grease (a lubricant that’s safe for rubber) can help.
- Odor tip: If you notice smells, ensure your P‑trap has water. The stopper can block smells from the basin, but a dry P‑trap below will still let sewer gas enter the cabinet.

Cleaning and care
- Daily: Lift the basket, invert over trash/compost, quick rinse. “Invert” just means turn it upside down so debris falls out.
- Weekly: Warm soapy soak and a soft brush through the perforations. Avoid harsh bleach on stainless steel (chlorine can pit or stain it); use baking soda paste for stubborn grime.
- Dishwasher: If it’s all stainless and silicone, top‑rack is usually safe. Dry promptly to prevent water spots.

Value
- For the price of a single pack, it’s a practical upgrade: less clog risk, easy sink soaks, and fewer odors. It’s cheaper than a plumbing call and kinder to your pipes than relying on chemical drain cleaners (which are caustic chemicals that can damage seals over time).

Verdict
- A simple, effective strainer/stopper combo that does what it promises. If your sink has the standard 3‑1/2 inch opening, it’s an easy yes. I’d rate it 4.5/5 for function, 4/5 for universal fit (measure older drains), and 4/5 for sealing (great for everyday use, not a bath‑tub‑tight plug).",1,1766080351.0,AmazonVine,7,0.6,False

1ppx8jw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ThrowRa_a-/comments/1ppx8jw/my_28f_boyfriend_27m_have_the_same_goals_for_the/,My (28F) boyfriend (27M) have the same goals for the future but the way he lives his life now doesn't seem to lead to those goals.,"I have been feeling very uncertain about my relationship and I could use some outside perspectives. I can already tell this is going to be very long, so I apologize for that and if you read or even skim, I greatly appreciate it.

A little bit of background first. This is my first serious relationship and we are long distance, about 6 hours away from each other. My boyfriend (27M) is Canadian and I (28F) am American. We've been dating almost a year and our relationship has been very healthy. We communicate things very well and deal with conflict in a respectful and kind way. We both feel like we can be ourselves. Our values closely align and we have similar worldviews. He treats me very well and listens to and takes actions about my worries. I love him and I would like to build a life with him. But I have concerns......

The best way to say it is that when we talk about the future together our goals and ideas align very well, but the way that he lives his life right now doesn't seem to reflect the future we talk about. The end goal is for me to move to Canada and I am in the process of finishing my Bachelor's as that will make it easier to get a visa. Plans keep changing on how long that will take though because of some bullshit changes the college is making but my boyfriend has been extremely proud and supportive of me during everything. I had a full time job when we started dating that I quit in the spring of this year but when plans changed for going back to school I started looking for other jobs. I did odd gardening jobs for people during the summer while looking for something more steady and eventually found a part time cleaning job. When fall came around, I started looking for something that wasn't going to be seasonal. I applied to over 80 jobs and was able to get a part time delivery driver job and a part time online job bringing up my amount of jobs to 3. On the other hand, my boyfriend didn't have a job when we started dating and the only job he's had since was a part time landscaping gig in the summer which was really spotty. He is on disability at the moment because of sensory issues (he's autistic), so he has money that comes in every month and he has had full time jobs in the past. When we are together we try to make things even but if we added things up I probably pay for things more. Since I added 2 more jobs to my schedule, it's been a little hard not to feel bitter when I know I'm working and saving money and getting my schooling done and I know he's at home playing video games until 2 am. I have talked with him about this and he was very understanding. He said he understood how things were feeling unbalanced and he knew that there was nothing he could say to fix how I was feeling, he needs to take action to do that. He has some serious trauma in his past and I know he often lives how he thinks he deserves, which is often not well. After our conversation, he made plans to apply to some specific places near him and start practice his driving more (he has a learner's right now). That night he was meeting up with someone to sell mead (a hobby of his that brings in $15-100 a month) and he ended up staying out drinking until 1 am which really didn't seem like the thing to do after our conversation earlier that day. That is not the norm for him and I do kind of think it was partly because of our emotional conversation earlier. Either way though it didn't seem like a smart choice or a healthy way of dealing with those emotions. I don't have more to say on that but I'd appreciate perspectives.

Another concern is about substances which I kind of talked about above. I grew up in a household that didn't even drink coffee, let alone alcohol or partake in any drugs. My mom now drinks coffee but that is the extent. I drink occasionally and will sometimes have weed to deal with anxiety, insomnia, and/or chronic pain but it's once a week at most and usually every other. I don't have a problem with substances, I think they have their purpose and place. My boyfriend grew up very differently. Marijuana and alcohol were present in the house from a very young age and he started smoking weed at 18. He does get very anxious and deals with sensory problems (autism and trauma related) and says that smoking weed helps keep those under control. My concern though is how much he smokes and I worry that it is or will become an unhealthy coping mechanism. He smokes every day, usually multiple times. I am not functional when I use cannabis products but I know some people can be, which seems to be the case for him. Either way though I think sometimes weed is used when he just needs to deal with things. I worry this will be a problem down the road, especially if we have kids as I don't want it to be normal for one of the parents to always be high or to have substances be super common in our household. I don't have problem with it being used occasionally as needed as long as it's not in a way that effects kids.

I don't have a lot of experience with relationships and I feel like there is a lot I don't know. Any advice, perspectives (positive or begative), or opinions are welcome. I needed to get all these thoughts laid out in writing which has helped but I feel like there is too much emotion here for me to look at it objectively. 

TLDR: I have concerns about the future of my relationship, especially concerning unbalanced work loads and his use of marijuana.

1ppx7r0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ppx7r0,Grandma Paranzino’s Baked Italian Rum Balls,"**Italian Chocolate Rum Balls**

This recipe comes from my Grandma Paranzino and has been part of our Christmas season for as long as I can remember. My sister and I grew up rolling these little chocolate rum balls at the kitchen table, long before our feet could even touch the floor. The original recipe was one of those old-school Italian cookies that leaned a little dry, so over the years, we gently tweaked it to give the cookie a softer bite while keeping every bit of the flavor we grew up with. Its been a holiday staple in our family for generations, and now I’m happy to share it with yours. 

**Ingredients**

**Dry ingredients**  
4 cups (450 g) sifted flour  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
1/2 teaspoon baking soda  
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves  
1/2 teaspoon allspice  
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1/2 teaspoon black pepper  
1 cup (200 g) sugar  
3/4 cup (75 g) baking cocoa

**Wet ingredients**  
1 cup (240 ml) Captain Morgan rum  
1/2 cup (120 ml) vegetable oil  
1/2 ounce (15 ml) rum extract

**Optional mix-ins**  
1/2 cup (60 g) walnuts  
1/2 cup (80 g) raisins

**Chocolate rum glaze**  
4 tablespoons (56 g) unsalted butter  
1/2 cup (50 g) baking cocoa, sifted

2 1/2 cups (275 g) sifted confectioners’ sugar  
2 ounces (60 ml) spiced rum  
1 teaspoon rum extract preferred, or you can use vanilla

**Method**

If using raisins, they can be soaked in rum for 24 to 48 hours to soften and deepen their flavor. Drain well before adding them to the dough. The soaking rum can be reserved for future baking or used as a flavorful addition to coffee or ice cream.

If using walnuts, they should be toasted to enhance their flavor. For stovetop toasting, place them in a dry skillet over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until fragrant. For oven toasting, spread them on a baking sheet and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 5 to 7 minutes until lightly browned. Transfer to a clean plate or bowl to cool completely, then finely chop and set aside.

In a large bowl, sift the flour before measuring. This step is very important. Then measure the sifted flour into a separate mixing bowl, or weigh it on a kitchen scale for accuracy.  
Add the baking powder, baking soda, cocoa, sugar, cloves, allspice, cinnamon, and black pepper to the flour and sift the mixture together. Whisk to fully combine.

If using walnuts and/or raisins, gently mix them into the dry ingredients. Adding them at this stage ensures they distribute evenly, because the dough becomes quite stiff once the wet ingredients are added. 

In a separate bowl, combine the rum, vegetable oil, and rum extract.  
Add the wet mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms. Using your hands works well to fully incorporate everything. 

For a deeper flavor, the dough can be refrigerated overnight or for up to two days. Shape it into a disk and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. This step is optional, as the dough holds its shape well even without resting. When ready to roll, remove the dough from the refrigerator and allow it to soften for at least 30 minutes.

Roll the dough into tight balls, about 1 to 1½ inches in size, roughly the size of a walnut. The dough will feel a little stiff as you roll it, and that’s normal.  
Place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet.

Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 8 to 9 minutes. The cookies will go from a dark brown to a lighter brown and may crack slightly.

Do not overbake, as these cookies can dry out quickly.  
Let the cookies rest on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before moving them to a cooling rack. 

**Make the Glaze** 

Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat.  
Once melted, gradually stir in the cocoa, adding a couple of tablespoons at a time while stirring constantly until smooth.  
When the cocoa is fully incorporated, remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the rum and rum extract (or vanilla).  
Add the confectioners’ sugar a little at a time until the glaze is smooth and glossy. The glaze should be thick but pourable, similar to warm chocolate icing.  
Keep a cup of room temperature water nearby and add 1/2 teaspoon at a time if a thinner consistency is needed.

Dip each cookie about halfway into the glaze and place them glaze side up on wax paper to set. The glaze will typically set within 30 minutes. 

**Storage**

Place the glazed, fully set cookies in an airtight container, using wax paper between layers. They can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.  
These cookies also freeze well and can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months.",5,1766080194.0,Baking,2,1.0,False

Not a question - but it will answer many on this subreddit.

2023 - After 6 years of living in Denmark I received a a job offer in CH and I grabbed it immediately. Not only because of the money (it was considered, but it wouldn’t have been so bad in DK), but because of the nature and vicinity to my home country (IT).

This post contains of course some generalisations for the sake of giving an idea of how life is here. I’d be curious to know what you readers think and what your experience in Switzerland has been so far.

Good:

1. Most people here are polite and respectful and have some common sense. You notice it in the early morning trains - very few people talking, and those who do moderate their tone. You see it when people first let passengers out, before they get in. People throw PET bottles in the PET bins. Cities are mostly clean. Bureaucratic procedures - at least those I had to do are straightforward. You can pay bills in literally 10 seconds. The difference with other countries can be very drastic. This is the first reason why I’d be very happy to spend the rest of my life here.
2. It’s a safe place. I have never felt unsafe in Switzerland - at whatever time, at whatever place. When some of my friends don’t want to go to Reitschule in Bern I can just laugh - it’s way safer than a similar place in any other European country.
3. Good money and plenty of opportunities. Although in the last year this changed a bit with some (planned) layoffs (see Novartis, Nestlé, CSL, etc.), I still see a dynamic job market for those who want to grow professionally. It’s an expensive country but hey, there are basically 5 countries in the whole planet where you can save/invest as much as here considering one has the same job. And no capital gain tax! The cliché ‘you get higher salaries but you also have higher expenses’ when scrutinised carefully just does not hold.
4. Nature. After 2+ years, I’m just in awe every time I take the train and I see mountains everywhere. It is the only country of the 5 I have lived in which is beautiful all year round. Spring - temperature rising, chill coffee-in-the-bed mornings, the green comes back. Summer - hiking, lakes, festivals, and so much more. Fall - amazing foliage, markets all around. Winter - mesmerising snowy landscapes, skis and sleds, more markets.
5. Other random things: people read. They go to museums. Things work most of the time. There are plenty of ways to optimise expenses.

Actually, not many cons. But:   
  
1. A difficult thing to do is to build a social circle - which comes also with a certain age (30+) and the working rhythms. Still, opportunities to meet people are somehow limited and the Swiss, having their comfortable social circle already established, don’t really have a reason to expand it or to join another. Yes, I joined a sport informal club (climbing). Yes, I learnt German (a nice B2 by now). I even go to a book club! 😀 And still I find myself longing for a bit more integration and true, lasting relationships. I am sure it will come with time.

2. My experience with the health system has been so far not worth the money that I pay towards it. Besides being very expensive, I felt doctors are way less prepared than they should be and not as empathic and understanding as I expect a doctor to be. I don't have any hope to see a change, but when a patient is seen basically as money, the priority becomes the money - and not the patient. 

Overall - I couldn't be happier. Those I met who are not happy they are either serial complainers or have not traveled enough to know how good of a time we are and we can have here in Switzerland. Cheers everyone. 



TL;DR - Switzerland is amazing - just a bit difficult to socialise and health system is meh. ",33,1766080170.0,askswitzerland,15,0.92,False

(25 f) 

I am currently looking to move soon and it occurred to me that Canada could be a good fit for me.

Some background: 

I have lived in Kentucky my whole life. I got married in 2021 and divorced in 2024, and currently work in banking.

I have my associates degree in visual art and desire to pursue art full time. I looked into going back to school, but it does not seem like the wisest choice in this economy.

I have experience working as a Barista in a bespoke coffee shop, corporate and local banking, and art in its various forms.

I also have a dog and currently rent.

My only debt is my car which I pay a bill on monthly.

Does anyone have any suggestions for a sensible location for me to move would be, or if this would even be worth looking into?

I want to get out of my hometown. I am an ambitious and hardworking person, yet there are no opportunities for me here, and with America on the decline I would love to leave.

However, I’m broke and I’m doing it all alone and I have no clue where to start. I don’t need a flashy life, I just need to get by. I’d love to move to a place with great public transportation as well so I could sell my car.

I have my passport yet I still have my married name. I have not changed it in case I needed my passport, but should I look into changing my name and passport now before doing it years down the line after moving? Just something I’m considering.

My ideal life would be to live in a city with a rich art scene where I could walk my dog and have public transportation and would be safe for me as a woman alone. 

Any input or advice AT ALL is welcome. 

Thanks!

Getting pregnant with a 4th was not planned at all. I lost 100lbs pp and miraculously became fertile. 


He works 50-60 hours a week, leaves at 9AM and comes home anywhere between 8PM, 12AM.  I'm by myself all day with our kids. Zero help, no family, no friends, just me and the kids. I lost both my parents before I turned 22. I don't really have any family. 

I understand he works long hours and I don't expect much but he literally does nothing to help me other than he will wash the dishes a few times a week, does the laundry and makes bottles before he goes to bed.  I do everything for everyone in my house, including him and I get the absolute bare minimum in return. He always reminds me he works & I don't give him enough credit or acknowledge how much he really does 🙄

Days go by and I get zero time for myself, not even a break to breathe. Rushed showers, cold coffee. I'm constantly in state of being overwhelmed, exhausted burnt out,  suicidal, lost, lonely, touched out. I do take medication, I do see a therapist and a psychiatrist. 

He comes home at night eats dinner in peace, showers, watches TV, goes outside to smoke weed, snacks, plays video games, reads books whatever he wants to do  and then decides to come to bed between 12-1. 

 Our baby cosleeps several times a week I'm forced to go to bed at 7PM because I cannot roll away, I'm stuck laying in bed in total darkness looking at the ceiling  sometimes I have to take him back out with me so I can take care of my other kids and then start the process over again . He also doesn't sleep very well a few nights a week so I might get 4-5 hours of broken sleep. 

When I don't get enough sleep & I can't roll away at night my mental health is noticably worse the following day. 

I lost it this morning. I was up at 630AM cleaning up the kitchen, trying to catch up on house work that's been neglected all week. He had the baby in bed with him, he didn't want to wake up / get out of bed but by 7AM the baby wasn't having it and didn't want to be forced to lay down anymore so of course he's fussy and whining. I can't listen to this shit at 7 in the morning I've been listening to it for days, along with the lack of sleep and zero break it was like fingernails on a chalkboard. So I take the baby back, change his diaper get him ready & plop him in the highchair with a toy & Cheerios & continue on but I'm angry now
. angry because I wanted a hot cup a coffee in peace while I clean without having to tend to a baby but nope. Btw he's capable of getting the baby up & ready in the morning while I do other things - he only extends himself that far after I've freaked out on him about needing more help. For 2 days he will be helpful then it's back to regular programming 

He knew I was mad because I yelled from the kitchen should have been born a man & then I'd be able to drink my coffee while it's still hot, so obviously he got up.

 I lost it on him, I was crying telling him I'm tired of begging for help & suppport, I'm tired of being a after thought, I don't feel loved or cared for, that I'm depressed & think about killing myself every day, I said mean things I called him a fat lazy slob, I told him I wanted a divorce, I told him not to come home because my life is easier when he's not here, to drive his car off a cliff. I'm not proud of the things I said, that's not who I am or who I want to be & he looked at me & said you act like I do nothing around here 

I truly feel crazy, I don't understand how someone can be so dense & incapable of getting IT. I don't know how you can say you love someone when they are telling you they don't feel loved. I don't understand how your wife the mother of your children can tell you she's depressed & having a hard time & all you can say is I do help. He can't even be bothered to take the kids & go out of the house on a random Saturday. He's never once in their lives planned an activity or taken them anywhere without me. 

I let him sleep in on the weekends, he gets time to himself every day to do whatever he wants after work, I cook 3 meals a day on the weekends for him & the kids. He plays video games & most of the time relaxes, sometimes I'll make him do an annoying project around the house or run errands that might take up an hour  or 2 of his day off but JFC I feel like a second class citizen asking for basic human decency & a little reciprocation.

I'm not sure the point of this post, I just needed a place to vent because I feel really lost & beat down by this season of my life

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Summary: it was a 3‑year relationship and there were no major problems, except jealousy. He didn’t want marriage and never promised anything about it (29M), but I thought that over time he might want it too. Even the day before the breakup, he was calling me “my dear,” we were very, very good. We were even making plans to move to the same city after my exam.

The breakup was sudden. He said he couldn’t give me the things I wanted, that we were incompatible, and that he wanted someone more easygoing. I’m now sure he won’t come back.

But there are things that confuse me, and maybe he’s doing one of the worst things one person can do to another… Or maybe he’s just easing his conscience, I don’t know. We’re still in contact. But it’s only “how are you, what are you doing” type conversations, and we went to the library together 3–4 times. Last Sunday he invited me to dinner — in a friendly way. We went, ate, had coffee, and he treated me like a very close friend. He even said things like, “I’m so happy we’re having coffee together.” When he calls me, I answer with hope, and we chat in a friendly way — sometimes for at least 20 minutes.

But today something different happened. I called him — I had a feeling inside and couldn’t stop myself. He spoke incredibly coldly. I told him I was bored and called just to chat. We talked for 5–6 minutes and he wanted to hang up. I don’t understand this. Just last week, he was the one who called me twice and invited me somewhere. When he calls, he’s cheerful, laughing, his voice sounds good. But when I call him, I didn’t expect this kind of coldness.

I can’t share this with anyone because everyone would think I’m obsessive or clingy, especially my family. That’s why I wanted to share it with you. If you have any advice or a different perspective, I’d like to hear it.

She had started showing signs of hormonal imbalance about a month ago and rapid lots her fur from her lower half, but she had tons of energy.  I noticed she was grinding her teeth in pain several days ago and made an appointment with her vet for yesterday morning.  Unfortunately, my sweet girl traveled to the rainbow bridge on the drive to the vet. 

This is second loss this year to hormone issues and cysts. Emergency exotic vets here had already told  that surgery would cast me $3k on top of any other procedures (ultrasound, ketamine etc).  And the surgery would likely fail. I have care credit but not enough to cover those bills. 

But that wasn't my only scare. Three of the remaining girls that shared a cage with her had stopped pooping. Their large c&c cage was poop free aside from som slight signs of mushy poops. My vet was kind of...unconcerned. he said ""they are just grieving. "" Around 1pm, still no poops. So I went into emergency mode. Got Critical Care doordashed to my house, and drove to get baby gas drops and pedialite from the store. Now, I only did this because I suspected that my vet might not be super well versed in guineapigs,  but always consult your vet first! I put my 3 girls together in a smaller setup on my coffee table.  I at first force fed them the three things, which now 2 of 3 love Critical care. I watched them all evening.  I started seeing mushy poops, then finally the first signs of poops! 

I put them back in their big home and went to bed. I am so glad to report my piggies pooped much more solid poops all over their cage today! I was so scared Id lose 4 piggies and not my one just my one sweet girl. I now have piggies aged 6, 5, 5 and three. I'm gonna keep Critical care in my freezer from now on.

I graduated with a BA and an MS in Psychology. After my MS graduation I worked in a research team in a hospital for \~8 months. I like conducting the assessment side of my job, but I didn't get along with the PI and my manager and honestly I didn't quite enjoy the overall research experience (funny it takes me 3 RAships and 1 pub to say this). The pay wasn't good either and I just can't see myself in an academic role long-term. I might consider a counselling degree in the future, but now I am more leaning towards industry jobs which I've been considering since my MS. I know User Experience Research or HR, and sometimes Marketing roles, might be suitable for psychology graduates. But at least in the Canadian job market, these roles are very competitive and commonly required direct schooling(not mentioning experience) in those subjects. So I wonder for those who left academia and have no licensure in mental health, what do you do and how did you land the job?  

If anyone is located in Toronto/Canada, I'd like to have a coffee chat with you if you don't mind:)",1,1766078973.0,psychologystudents,0,1.0,False

I Don’t Think We Were in the Real Hospital Anymore,"It was past midnight when Chris and I left the old 24-hour diner at the edge of town. We had spent the evening catching up over burgers and coffee, talking about high school memories and future plans that would likely never materialize.

As we strolled toward my car parked a little further down the block, Chris slowed his pace. I glanced over and noticed him rubbing his temples. He was pale.

""Everything okay, man?"" I asked, half-jokingly. ""Too much greasy diner food?""

Chris shook his head, wincing as he leaned against a nearby lamppost. ""No, it’s… different,"" he mumbled. ""Everything's spinning."" He grimaced, clutching his stomach as he swayed on his feet.

I rushed over and grabbed him by the arm just as his legs gave out. His breathing was ragged, each breath shallow and strained. A jolt of panic shot through me. I wasn’t sure what was happening, but it was more than just a bad burger.

""Come on,"" I said, guiding him toward the car. ""We need to get you to the hospital.""

We barely made it to the passenger seat before he collapsed completely. I managed to push him inside, buckling his seatbelt as his head lolled against the window. His breathing had grown faint, his skin cold. I didn’t waste any more time. I jumped into the driver’s seat and sped toward the hospital. The roads were empty, the entire town blanketed in a pale bluish light that made everything look strangely surreal.

When the hospital finally came into view, I pulled up to the emergency entrance and skidded to a stop. The automatic doors slid open with a soft hiss, and I half-dragged, half-carried Chris inside. The bright fluorescent lights inside the emergency room burned my eyes as I shouted for help.

A nurse and a security guard rushed over immediately. Chris was placed on a gurney and whisked away into a triage room. I tried to follow, but the nurse held up a hand. ""You need to stay in the waiting room, sir. Someone will come speak to you soon.""

Reluctantly, I turned back and made my way into the waiting room. It was a small, uninviting space lined with rows of faded plastic chairs. The harsh lighting overhead buzzed like a hive of angry bees, casting a cold, sterile glow over everything. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic, with a hint of something stale, like old coffee or cheap hospital food.

The reception desk sat at the far end of the room, cluttered with stacks of paperwork and a dusty computer monitor. Behind the desk, a tired-looking receptionist typed away with little enthusiasm, barely glancing up as I entered. She looked like she had been working the night shift for years, with deep shadows under her eyes and a weary slump in her posture. A glass partition separated her from the waiting area, with a small sliding window used to speak to patients.

Aside from the receptionist, there were only a few other people scattered around the room. A middle-aged man in a wrinkled jacket sat slumped in a chair, staring blankly at the floor tiles, his face pale and drawn. Across from him, a young woman scrolled through her phone, her foot tapping rhythmically against the leg of the chair. In the far corner, an elderly woman with a hunched back knitted quietly, her lips moving as she murmured to herself, though I couldn’t make out the words.

The wall-mounted TV flickered above, showing a muted news broadcast with closed captions scrolling across the screen. Next to it, a clock ticked irregularly, the second hand jerking with each movement as though struggling to keep time. The room itself seemed caught in some liminal state.

I chose a seat near the corner, trying to calm my breathing. My heart was still racing from the rush to the hospital.

The seat beneath me was stiff and uncomfortable, offering little relief from the tension gripping my body. I shifted, trying to find a better position, when I felt something crinkle under my leg. Frowning, I reached down and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper that had been wedged into the chair. It was old and yellowed at the edges, like it had been left there for a while.

Curious, I unfolded the paper and smoothed it out on my lap. The handwriting was rushed, uneven, as if whoever wrote it had been in a hurry, or panicked. The list was numbered, and as I began to read, I couldn't help but feel a mix of surprise and amusement at what was written there.

Rule 1. ""Avoid making eye contact with the receptionist between 2:00 AM and 2:30 AM.""

I raised an eyebrow. That seemed oddly specific. Why would anyone write something like that? I glanced over at the receptionist, who was still tapping away at her keyboard, oblivious to the rest of the room. Was this some kind of prank? The idea made me smirk a little, despite the heaviness in the air.

Rule 2. ""Never walk past the reception desk without greeting the receptionist after 2:30 AM.""

I let out a short, dry laugh. ""So I’m supposed to be polite now?"" I muttered under my breath, shaking my head. It was all so ridiculous. Maybe someone had written this as a joke to mess with the people stuck here at odd hours, bored out of their minds. I could imagine some bored night-shifter scribbling out these 'rules' as a way to pass the time.

Rule 3. ""If a visitor arrives asking for directions, do not help them.""

I paused. That one was… strange. It carried a different weight compared to the others. Who wouldn’t help someone lost in a hospital, of all places?

Rule 4. ""If you hear your friend’s voice calling from down the hallway, do not leave the waiting room to look for them.""

The amusement drained from my expression. I felt a chill run up my spine, as if the temperature in the room had just dropped a few degrees. I glanced toward the dimly lit hallway that led to the ER rooms. It seemed to stretch into darkness. I shook my head, pushing the thought away. This list was just some random nonsense… wasn't it?

I continued reading, my curiosity now tinged with unease.

Rule 5. ""If a power outage occurs, stay seated and do not move.""

Rule 6. ""If a door that should be locked is found open, close it immediately and do not look inside.""

The hairs on the back of my neck prickled. I couldn’t explain why, but each rule seemed to grow darker, more foreboding as I read on. It wasn’t just the content of the rules, it was the way they were written, as if someone were trying to warn me.

Rule 7. ""Do not look through the glass doors leading to the courtyard after 4:00 AM.""

Rule 8. ""If you feel a sudden chill, do not look over your shoulder.""

That one made me swallow hard. There was something inherently unsettling about the thought of a chill creeping up on you from behind, and not being able to turn around to see what, or who might be there. I couldn't help but glance behind me, but there was nothing there. Just the same sterile room, with its faded chairs and buzzing lights.

I reached the last rule, and for some reason, my heart beat a little faster.

Rule 9. ""If a security guard tells you it’s time to leave, check the clock before listening. It's safe to leave after 6:00 AM.""

My gaze flicked up to the wall-mounted clock, its second hand twitching with every tick. It read 1:30 AM.

At the bottom of the paper, written in shaky red ink, were the words: ""Trust me. I learned the hard way.""

There was a dark, crusted stain on the corner, one that looked disturbingly like dried blood. The sight of it made my stomach twist. I rubbed my fingers over the words, feeling the rough texture of the ink beneath my skin.

I couldn’t help but let out a short, nervous laugh. ""What kind of place is this?"" I whispered to myself.

I slumped back in the chair. It was hard to shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, but I forced myself to dismiss it as a weird prank. The list couldn’t actually mean anything, just someone’s twisted idea of a joke. I leaned my head back against the wall and closed my eyes, trying to calm my thoughts. A part of me couldn’t stop thinking about Chris and the way he had collapsed in the parking lot.

The quiet hum of the waiting room wrapped itself around me, making the place feel even more isolating. That’s when I heard it. My name, spoken in a low, barely audible voice that seemed to drift down the hallway. ""Adam… Adam...""

My eyes shot open, and my body tensed. The voice was unmistakable, it was Chris. I jerked my head towards the corridor leading to the ER rooms, but there was no one in sight, just the pale overhead lights flickering. The voice came again, a little louder this time. ""Adam, help me…""

I jumped up from the chair, the sound of my name sending shivers down my spine. My feet were already moving before I realized it. I took a few steps into the hallway.

I glanced back at the waiting area, now a few steps behind me. The other visitors, still scattered about, seemed completely unaware, oblivious to the voice echoing down the hall.

""Adam…"" Chris’s voice was more desperate now, laced with pain.

I took another step down the hallway, my footsteps echoing against the floor. As I walked deeper into the corridor, the fluorescent lights overhead buzzed louder, some of them flickering out completely, leaving long stretches of darkness. The ER rooms lined the sides of the hallway, their doors slightly ajar.

I hesitated as I reached one of the open doorways. I peered inside and immediately wished I hadn’t. There, standing in the center of the dimly lit room, was a man in a patient’s gown, facing me. The man's head moved in quick, jerking motions, shaking from side to side so rapidly that I couldn’t make out any details. It was just a blur, a sickening blur. Then, without warning, the door slammed shut with a deafening bang, and I stumbled back in shock.

My breathing grew shallow as I tried to make sense of what I’d just seen. But there was no time to process it. Chris’s voice came again, further down the hallway, ""Adam, please…""

I pushed forward, forcing myself to continue. The unsettling darkness around me seemed to press in from all sides. I came across another room, the door half-open. Inside, I could see a doctor standing over a patient, his back hunched as he examined something on the table. The doctor wore a white lab coat and surgical mask, his features obscured. But there was something off about the way he moved, his motions were robotic. Then I noticed the tool in his hand, a bone saw. He raised it slowly, the harsh metal glinting under the dim light, and then I heard a gut-wrenching scream from the patient on the table.

I stumbled backward, slamming into the wall behind me, my eyes wide with terror. When I looked back into the room, it was empty. There was no doctor, no patient. Just a dark, vacant space.

My hands trembled as I rubbed my face, trying to snap out of whatever hallucination I was trapped in. ""This can’t be real,"" I whispered to myself, but the corridor seemed to stretch endlessly ahead of me, and Chris’s voice continued to call out, drawing me further in.

As I turned the next corner, I froze. There, hanging in the doorway of a nearby room, was a mass of dark hair, long and tangled, spilling down from just beyond the doorframe. It looked like someone was standing behind the door, peeking around the corner. A single eye, black as pitch, stared directly at me from the darkness.

I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. The figure remained there, still and silent, just watching me. I took a slow step forward, and then the eye pulled back into the shadows, disappearing from view. The hallway was deathly quiet, save for the low hum of the lights. I forced myself to move past the doorway, my pulse hammering in my ears.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the figure again, just around the corner of the room, her head unnaturally high, as if she were crouched against the ceiling. I could see more of her this time; her elongated arm stretched out, the bony hand reaching towards me. Before I could react, the hand brushed my shoulder, cold and corpse-stiff... its fingers scratched into my skin like claws.

I bolted, my shoes squeaking on the linoleum as I raced down the hallway. I had no idea where I was going; I just wanted to get away from whatever that thing was. I threw open the first door I saw and stumbled back into the waiting room.

My heart pounded in my chest as I staggered to a stop. Everything appeared normal again, the reception desk, the plastic chairs, the other visitors who hadn’t moved an inch. It was as if none of it had happened. But my skin prickled with the lingering touch of that hand. Glancing at my shoulder, I noticed 3 faded scratch marks, a reminder that something was very, very wrong.

I slumped back into a chair, catching my breath, trying to make sense of the nightmare I had just experienced. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the crumpled list of rules, my hands trembling as I unfolded it. I glanced at Rule 4 again, the words seeming to taunt me: If you hear your friend’s voice calling from down the hallway, do not leave the waiting room to look for them.

I had ignored it, and now I was starting to believe that those rules weren’t a joke after all.

I tried to calm myself, my breathing coming in short, ragged gasps as I leaned back in the chair. I ran my hands through my hair, trying to force myself to think rationally. Maybe I was just sleep-deprived, or maybe the stress of seeing Chris collapse was catching up to me. I told myself that I had only imagined the things I saw in the hallway. But no matter how hard I tried to convince myself, the feeling of that cold hand brushing against my skin lingered.

I glanced at the clock, 1:45 AM. The minutes seemed to crawl by. I couldn't shake the dread that had settled in my chest. My thoughts drifted back to the list of rules. Each one seemed ridiculous on its own, but after my experience in the hallway, I found myself paying closer attention to each word.

That was when I noticed him, a man who hadn’t been in the room before. He stood near the entrance, his hands stuffed into the pockets of his long coat, his eyes scanning the waiting room like he was searching for someone. His presence sent a jolt of unease through me. I was sure he hadn’t been there earlier; I would have remembered his tall, lanky figure and the unsettling way his gaze seemed to linger on the other visitors, one by one.

The list. I pulled it from my pocket and read the third rule again: If a visitor arrives asking for directions, do not help them.

The man’s gaze found me, and he started walking toward where I sat. My body stiffened, every muscle tensing involuntarily. There was no mistaking his intention. He stopped a few feet away, leaning slightly forward, as though inspecting me.

""Excuse me,"" he said in a voice that was calm, but too deliberate. ""Could you help me find the ICU? I seem to be… a little lost.""

The tone of his voice was polite enough, but there was something off about it, something that put me on edge. It was as though he was trying to mimic normal speech but wasn’t quite getting it right. I glanced around the waiting room, but no one else seemed to notice the man’s presence. The receptionist didn’t even look up.

I shook my head, gripping the list tighter in my hand. ""I’m sorry. I can’t help you,"" I stammered.

The man didn’t move. He just kept staring at me, his eyes narrowing slightly. ""Are you sure?"" he asked, his voice growing softer, almost coaxing. ""It won’t take but a moment. It’s just down the hall… right?""

I didn’t know what to say. A part of me felt guilty for not helping him. But the words on the list kept flashing in my mind: Do not help them.

I forced myself to look away, hoping he would take the hint and leave. But instead, he took a step closer.

""It’s not very kind to ignore someone who needs help,"" he said, his tone now edged with something darker. I glanced at his face, and for a split second, his features seemed to shift. His mouth stretched into a wide, unnatural grin, the kind that didn’t belong on a human face. The corners of his lips seemed to extend too far, the teeth behind them slightly jagged.

I shot up from my chair, stumbling backward. The man’s smile didn’t waver as he turned his head slightly, like he was examining me from a different angle. Then, he turned towards the reception desk and started walking, slowly and unnatural. At one point, his head snapped towards me, unnaturally, the same grin on his face, as he continued walking. I froze, I couldn't look away. Then, as he reached the reception desk, he just passed thru it and then he suddenly disappeared.

My gaze darted around the waiting room. The other visitors were still exactly where they had been moments ago, their expressions unchanged, their movements as mechanical as before.

I glanced back at the receptionist. She was still at her desk, her face illuminated by the pale glow of the computer screen.

My gaze flickered up to the clock on the wall, it was 1:58 AM, and Rule 1 flashed in my mind: Avoid making eye contact with the receptionist between 2:00 AM and 2:30 AM.

After a few minutes, I glanced toward her, my eyes drifting out of habit. It was just for a second. The receptionist was staring straight at me, her eyes locked onto mine with an intensity that made my heart skip a beat. She wasn’t moving. It was as if she’d been waiting for this moment.

I tore my gaze away, my pulse quickening. As I turned my head, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed her get up from her chair, her movements oddly stiff, as though her joints didn’t bend the right way. She walked forward, but not around the reception desk, she passed through it, like it wasn’t even there. I froze, not daring to look directly at her again.

I squeezed my eyes shut. I felt the air grow colder, the chill pressing against my skin. It felt as if she were getting closer. I could hear the faintest rustle of fabric, the light creak of footsteps on the floor, growing louder with each passing second.

Don’t look… just don’t look, I told myself, my hands gripping the edges of the chair. I sat there, tense and unmoving, my eyes squeezed shut as if I could will her away by sheer force of will.

Then, everything went still. The room fell into an unnatural quiet, the buzz of the fluorescent lights the only sound left to ground me in reality. I opened my eyes slowly, half-expecting to see her standing inches away from me, her face contorted into something inhuman. But the receptionist was back at her desk, looking down at the monitor, her posture as unbothered as if she hadn’t moved at all. The other people in the waiting room seemed unchanged, as though nothing unusual had happened.

I glanced at the clock. 2:40 AM.

A wave of relief washed over me, my shoulders sagging as the tension finally started to leave my body. I forced myself to my feet, my legs still shaky beneath me. I couldn’t just sit there, feeling like a trapped animal. I needed to move, to clear my head.

As I got up to walk around the room, I remembered Rule 2: Never walk past the reception desk without greeting the receptionist after 2:30 AM. I wasn’t about to take any more chances. I turned toward the receptionist and gave her a nod, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Uh… hi,"" I mumbled awkwardly.

She didn’t look up, didn’t react at all, just continued to type away on the keyboard. I took that as a good sign and began walking a slow circle around the waiting room, forcing myself to stay calm, to pretend that everything was normal.

The chill in the air hadn’t entirely left. As I walked, I could feel a subtle shift in the temperature, a lingering cold that seemed to follow me. The overhead lights flickered faintly, casting brief shadows along the walls, giving the impression that the room was expanding and contracting with each pulse.

As I rounded the corner, I felt the presence behind me, something that wasn’t there before. I didn’t hear footsteps, but I sensed it nonetheless, like the weight of unseen eyes pressing against my back. It was close, just out of reach. My instinct was to turn and look, to confront whatever was creeping up behind me, but I clenched my jaw and kept my gaze forward, remembering Rule 8: If you feel a sudden chill, do not look over your shoulder.

I walked faster, my pulse quickening as the chill seemed to grow stronger with every step. The lights buzzed louder, the flickering more erratic. I felt something brush against the back of my neck, cold and light, like a breath.

I didn’t stop until I reached the chairs again, sinking into one with a shuddering breath. The presence faded, though the air remained icy, and I rubbed my hands together to warm them. I glanced back toward the reception desk, half-expecting to see the receptionist watching me again, but she remained focused on her monitor, her face lit by the soft glow of the screen.

I leaned back in the chair, my heart still racing. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong, that the rules on that crumpled piece of paper weren’t just random scribbles left behind to scare people. Whatever game I’d found myself in, it wasn’t a joke. And now, the only way out seemed to be playing along.

I sat there for a long moment, my body trembling, trying to calm my nerves and slow my breathing.

That’s when I heard the automatic doors slide open with a soft hiss. I looked up, expecting to see another late-night visitor or a nurse making rounds, but my heart almost stopped when I saw who stepped inside.

It was Chris.

He looked perfectly fine, normal. His face had color, his clothes were clean. There wasn’t a single sign that anything had been wrong with him. Relief rushed through me, and I felt the tension in my muscles finally ease.

Chris’s eyes found mine, and he broke into a small smile as he walked over.

""Hey, Adam,"" he said casually, his voice the same as always. ""They let me out early.""

The relief was so overwhelming that I laughed out loud. ""Chris, man, you scared the hell out of me,"" I said, shaking my head. ""Are you sure you’re okay? You looked pretty bad earlier.""

He shrugged, giving a dismissive wave of his hand as he settled into the chair next to me. ""Yeah, I’m fine now. Whatever it was, I guess it passed. They ran a few tests and said there was nothing serious."" He flashed that familiar grin, the one I’d seen a thousand times. ""Guess I’m just too stubborn to stay sick.""

As we talked, something in the back of my mind itched. There was an unsettling quality to the conversation, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Chris was acting normal, too normal. He was speaking in a calm, deliberate tone, his words perfectly measured. I brushed it off, figuring it was just my nerves playing tricks on me after everything that had happened tonight.

Still, as Chris continued to talk, a strange sense of déjà vu settled over me. It was as if the conversation was looping back on itself, repeating the same phrases. His voice had the same rhythm, the same inflection, almost like a recording on a loop.

Suddenly. I turned to see a nurse walking briskly down the hallway, pushing a gurney. My stomach dropped when I saw who was lying on it, Chris. He was unconscious, hooked up to a heart monitor, an oxygen mask over his face.

My gaze darted back to the seat next to me, but the chair was empty. The Chris who had been sitting beside me was gone, vanished as though he’d never been there at all. My skin prickled as a wave of cold panic spread through me.

I stared at the empty chair for a long moment, my heart pounding in my ears. Then, I saw the nurse walking by the waiting room. She glanced over at me briefly, her expression neutral.

I jumped up from my chair. ""Wait,"" I called after her. ""Is Chris okay? My friend, he was just sitting here. What’s going on?""

The nurse slowed, turning to look at me with a small, tight-lipped smile. ""Your friend is stable,"" she said. ""But he hasn’t woken up yet.""

Her words hung in the air, leaving me cold and confused. I glanced back at the empty seat, then at the nurse as she continued down the ER hallway.

My head was spinning. Had Chris really been here, or had I just imagined him?

I sank back into my chair, my body heavy with fatigue and fear. I glanced at the clock again, 3 AM. Time was moving, but not in the way it should have. I felt trapped, as though the minutes were pulling me further into the unknown.

I pulled the crumpled list of rules from my pocket and unfolded it with trembling hands, my eyes scanning the lines again, looking for answers that weren’t there. I needed to understand what was happening to me, what was happening in this place. But the rules only deepened the mystery, the words twisting in my mind like a riddle I couldn’t solve.

Time seemed to move strangely now. I couldn’t tell how long I had been sitting in that chair, how long I had been wandering the room. The clock above seemed to skip minutes or stall entirely, and my sense of reality continued to blur. I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the fatigue that clung to me like a shroud. I glanced at the clock again, it showed 5:55 AM. Almost there, I thought. Almost free.

That was when a security guard appeared in the doorway, his silhouette casting a long shadow across the waiting room floor. He was a broad-shouldered man with a neatly trimmed mustache and a calm, almost reassuring presence. He walked toward me with an easy stride and stopped just a few feet away.

""Sir, it's time to leave,"" he said in a deep, measured voice. ""The ER is closing for non-patient visitors.""

I blinked, my thoughts catching up slowly. ""But… my friend, Chris… is still…""

Just then, I saw Chris walking out of the ER hallway. He waved to me, a tired but genuine smile on his face. Relief flooded through me, and I started to get up, then hesitated, the words from Rule 9 echoing in my head: If a security guard tells you it’s time to leave, check the clock before listening.

I turned my gaze toward the clock above the reception desk, 6:01 AM. My shoulders sagged in relief. I was finally free of this place. I nodded and followed the security guard toward the exit, Chris walking beside me. As we stepped out into the cool morning air, I felt like I could finally breathe again.

We got into my car, and I started the engine. I felt a small smile tug at my lips. I pulled out of the hospital parking lot, the tension in my chest slowly beginning to fade.

But as I drove, a strange unease crept over me. The world outside the car windows seemed darker than it should have been. I glanced at the sky, it was still a deep, inky black, with no trace of the early morning light. It was too dark, too quiet.

I squinted, peering between the trees lining the road, and my heart skipped a beat. In the shadows, I saw faint figures standing there, their forms barely visible, distorted as if they were made of mist.

Panic surged through me. I glanced at the dashboard clock, and my stomach dropped, 4:30 AM. How was that possible? It had been well past 6:00 AM when we left the hospital. I turned to look at Chris in the passenger seat, my heart pounding in my ears.

But it wasn’t Chris.

There was a shadow there, sitting beside me. Its form was a vague silhouette, its face obscured, but I could feel it watching me, feel its eyes boring into my skin. I gasped, my grip on the steering wheel tightening as my vision blurred with fear. I slammed on the brakes, skidding to a halt in the middle of the road.

Suddenly, I was back in the waiting room, seated in the same stiff plastic chair. The security guard stood in front of me, a grin spreading slowly across his face, his eyes unnaturally wide and gleaming in the harsh fluorescent light.

""Time to leave,"" he said again, his voice echoing in my head like a taunt.

I felt my mind start to unravel. Had I ever left the hospital at all? Was I trapped here, destined to relive these twisted events over and over again? I buried my face in my hands, my breathing ragged as a sense of hopelessness washed over me.

It felt like hours passed, but it could have been minutes, or even seconds. I didn’t know anymore. I was dimly aware of a nurse standing in front of me, her voice calm and soothing, pulling me back from the edge.

""Sir, your friend is stable,"" she said gently. ""He’s going to be okay, but he needs rest. He’ll be transferred to a hospital room soon, and you can visit him during regular visiting hours.""

I looked up at her, my vision clearing slowly. The waiting room was just as it had been, no sign of the security guard or anything out of the ordinary. I glanced at the clock, it read 6:30 AM, and a soft glow of morning sunlight filtered through the glass doors, filling the room with a warm light. The nightmare was over.

I nodded to the nurse, murmuring my thanks, and stumbled out of the ER, the cool morning air a welcome relief. As I reached my car, I glanced back at the hospital, half-expecting to see something out of place. But it looked like any other hospital in the early light, mundane and unthreatening. I got in the car and drove home, the sun finally rising to chase away the last remnants of darkness.

Later that day, I returned to the hospital to visit Chris. He was awake, sitting up in bed and looking surprisingly well for someone who had collapsed so suddenly the night before.

""Hey,"" I said, my voice trembling slightly as I pulled a chair up to his bedside. ""How are you feeling?""

Chris chuckled weakly. ""Better than I should, I guess,"" he replied. ""But I had the weirdest dreams last night. It was like I was half-conscious the whole time.""

My heart skipped a beat. ""What kind of dreams?""

Chris frowned, his brow furrowing as he tried to recall. ""One of them was… I came in the ER and saw you sitting in the waiting room. You looked pretty freaked out. And then there was another one… we were leaving the hospital together, just driving away into the night.""

A cold shiver ran down my spine, but I forced a smile and nodded. ""Yeah… weird,"" I said quietly, my mind racing with the memory of the night’s events.

As we sat there talking, I glanced at my shoulder, where a constant pain kept tugging at me, and saw the three scratch marks from last night.

I couldn’t shake the feeling that somewhere, out there in the darkness of the night I had just escaped, something was still waiting… and the rules of this place would not be so easily [forgotten.](https://www.reddit.com/user/CreepyStoriesJR/comments/1ilh8mp/creepystoriesjr_story_list/)",2,1766078591.0,CreepyStoriesArchive,0,1.0,False

Im trying concerta after Straterra. Straterra worked wonders for anxiety but didnt help with executive dysfunction, so my doc wanted to try stimulants 

Did 10 days on 18, felt awake the first few days then honestly it just made me tired and low motivation. 

Now I’m on 2 days of 27 and I really don’t feel any different. I feel less motivated but it could also be the winter. I’ve been slower at work too, just overall more down. 

The only thing I really noticed is that when it’s in effect the songs in my head feel less strong and distracting. But it’s also harder for me to enter a flow at work. 

Does that mean that the dose is still too low? Or like what. I’ve also stopped drinking coffee to prevent a crash since I would get hot flashes towards the end but I’m REALLLY missing it now lol. 

Am I just expecting too much too soon? Should I be patient with higher doses or ask to switch to something else? Like what should I feel when I do feel I works, I can’t imagine it being good that I’m down but “awake” and more aware of present.

1ppwggg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ppwggg,Brown oily liquid leaking from Thermomix TM5,"Hi everyone,

Recently, we noticed a brownish liquid underneath our Thermomix TM5 that looked and smelled like oil — not cooking oil, but more like motor oil. This already happened once several months ago, just that one time, and back then I thought something had leaked from the coffee we had made. Color-wise that would have made sense, but not taste-wise (yes, I tested it back then and already suspected motor oil). But after that, nothing happened for a long time, until yesterday it showed up again. Now we’re sure it’s not coming from inside the bowl, because we made a pumpkin soup and the liquid underneath was dark brown again (see pictures for details).

Has anyone experienced something similar or has any tips or ideas what this could be? Any hints would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!",0,1766078429.0,thermomix,6,0.5,False

1ppwfx8,https://i.redd.it/c1va1brrxz7g1.jpeg,The Monica List,"Monica  
defies those stereotypes and putting people in boxes. She's doing the heavyliftig that The Breakfast Club started in 1985.  
She's a jock, not too much into watching sports but strong and obsessed with winning at football, running, wrestling ...  
She's a nerd, happy to sit at the front of the class, asking the teacher to give the class a test, quick to memorize and organize ...  
She's an artist, who decorates a Christmas tree beautifully, who makes food look and taste good, who decorates her appartment carefully ...  
She's an unpopular insecure overweight girl, still desperately wondering why she doesn't have a boyfriend ...  
She's a popular beautiful woman, who attracts the billionaire Pete in season 3, the hot Richard from season 2 all the way to season 6, and many other men ...  
She's ethical and honest to everyone who she dates about everything including what she really wants, she's honest with herself ...  
She's sketchy, controlling, lying when it comes to winning the lottery ...  
She's generous and kind and a people-pleaser ...

Sadly, of course, the writers chose to give her moments that just make me furious.  
But they deserve to appreciate what is great about her.

\- she gave Rachel her baby name

\- she's honest to Pete and to Richard and breaks up with them instead of desperately settling and clinging to a guy who has such different plans and goals  
\- she's cooking for the entire friends group over and over, special occassion or not

\- she actually makes filtered coffee

\- she accepted Phoebe, who had previously lived on the streets, as her roommate and welcomed her into her group of friends - shouldn't be counted as anything special but it counts as kind open-mindedness

\- she let Rachel (who possibly abandoned and rejected her for a 'high society' life) live with her for free at first, helped Rachel to gain the courage to destroy the credit cards and find a job

\- always supported Rachel when Rachel cried, put a blanket on Rachel when she was sleeping on the couch after the breakup in season 3

\- overcame teenage obesity

\- grew up in an emotionally abusive home, with a mother who subjected her to relentless criticism and verbal mistreatment, and emerged with a sense of her own self-worth, determination to fulfil her dreams, and huge capacity to care for others

\- forgave her brother for being more loved or treated as more loved by their parents and treated him the same as her closest friends

\- she suffered through unemployment and shitty jobs, but refused to take unfair advantages she hadn’t earned, like Pete buying her a restaurant

\- she gained a prestigious head chef position based entirely on her own merit

\- refused to let Richard have kids with her for the wrong reasons

\- gave Chandler time to propose, which he did sooner than she expected, and also she gave him time to decide when he was ready to have kids - despite these being things she desperately craved

\- she refused a perfect John Stamos sperm and insisted if it cannot be Chandler's child, it should be adoption

\- she told Chandler he could be a great husband and father that he never saw in himself and she was proved 100% right

\- she resisted her control-freak coping mechanisms to give Chandler the power of making the big decisions about their future, (saying ‘I Love you’, moving in together, marriage), so he could work through his commitment phobia

\- encouraged her husband to quit a job he hated, then supported him – financially and emotionally –through his subsequent unemployment and helped him find his dream career

\- wanted to give Amanda another chance after realizing she was scrappy enough to convince Phoebe to keep being her friend

\- comforted Chandler when he was struggling because of Janice or when Joey was dating Chandler's crush Cathy

\- taught him the 7 points

.... She would be a great friend to have :)

However, with both of these amps, the vocal harmonies are inconsistent at best. Probably about 7/10 times the harmonies are totally off key when I switch a chord. Or it starts off key and then eventually finds the right spot. I know they go off the guitar chords so I’ve tried strumming more forcefully to no avail. Obviously, this won’t work for live performances as I can’t have off key harmonies.. do the stand alone harmonizer pedals work better? I’m wondering if using one where I can set the key beforehand would be a better solution.. does that exist? Or is there something I’m missing to get these amps to work properly?

I explained that I didn’t know anyone else was coming and how my ADHD brain doesn’t do well with a last minute change like that, and offered to kill time walking around till they were done. she then suggests grabbing me a coffee and we can just walk around and take her toddler (who I truly do love) to the playground since he won’t want to sit at the cafe. so I just told her I thought we were getting lunch together for my birthday and that she seemed too busy so we’ll just do it another time, she said that was fine but explained she thought we were just grabbing a coffee, not sitting down for lunch. I just got home and am very, probably irrationally, upset. I’m not mad at her and hope we do reschedule, I just feel massively disappointed and unimportant. and somewhat embarrassed because I feel this way at my big age. I don’t have birthday parties because they stress me out and I get awful RSD if “enough” people don’t show up, so this little lunch with my closest friend (no masking, just love and light!!) meant a lot to me, and somehow the plans became watching her do paperwork with someone idk and going to the toddler playground. I’m grateful I have a fancy dinner planned with my partner this weekend. thanks for letting me vent friends :(",2,1766078110.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False
1ppwbbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Credtrusai/comments/1ppwbbl/its_like_being_debtfree/,It's Like Being Debt-Free,"https://preview.redd.it/k9g56r6lwz7g1.jpg?width=635&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13cf542142966735b232ab081b41757e5756dee3

When we're in debt, every paycheck feels smaller than it should. We're told to just manage it better and keep making minimum payments.   
  
This is exactly how most of us are taught to think about diabetes: Take your meds, watch it slowly get worse, and accept that this is just how life is from now on.   
  
For years, marketing campaigns pushed the idea that diabetes was mainly caused by not exercising enough.  
  
Coca-Cola pushed the idea that we could keep drinking their products as long as we stayed active; they even funded the Global Energy Balance Network to promote this message.  
  
The Global Energy Balance Network was a non-profit that claimed to study obesity, but it became known for pushing the idea that people were overweight because they didn't exercise enough, and not because of unhealthy diets.  
  
Pepsi and others pushed the same agenda; this propaganda was convenient for these soda cartels because it shifted blame onto us while protecting their ultra-processed sugar-heavy products. But exercise alone never explained why people who jog, work physical jobs, or go to the gym still end up insulin-resistant and diabetic.  
  
Today, about 38 million Americans have diabetes, and the numbers keep rising. Yet most of our doctors are trained to manage this disease, not reverse it.   
  
Medical education and guidelines from orgs like the American Diabetes Association and even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have long labeled type 2 diabetes as chronic and progressive. So when our doctors are taught that something only gets worse, their job then becomes managing and slowing its progression.   
  
But bringing blood sugar and insulin levels back to normal without ongoing medication is possible, the same way being debt-free is possible even after years of living with debt.  
  
One of the most effective tools to do this is fasting. Every time we eat, our bodies raise insulin, and when insulin stays high all day from constant eating, sugar stays trapped in the body.   
  
Fasting creates a pause where insulin can drop, and the body can start burning stored sugar instead of adding more.  
  
But neither one of us should jump into it right off the bat, easing into fasting matters; we should start by skipping a snack, then a meal, or replacing a meal with water, tea, or black coffee, gradually spacing meals farther apart, and cutting foods that spike insulin the most, like refined carbs and sugars, before extending fasts.   
  
More importantly, consistency matters; that's why this shouldn't be done alone. We need doctors who understand remission and can help adjust our meds safely, monitor blood sugar, and guide us throughout this process.  
  
Fasting also makes exercise a lot more effective; it pulls sugar out of the blood and fat out of storage to be used as fuel. As liver fat drops, insulin works better, blood sugar steadies, and weight loss happens naturally. We don't have to obsess over weight loss; the body simply lets go of excess weight once it's allowed to burn what it has been storing.  
  
Remission is real, but it's not easy, and it's not guaranteed for everyone: genetics, how long we've had diabetes, how much damage has already been done to the pancreas, meds, stress, sleep, income, food access, and mental health all matter.   
  
Like getting out of debt, some of us start much farther behind, and others have more flexibility.   
  
But we can reverse type 2 diabetes.  
  
You or someone you know can reverse type 2 diabetes.

1ppwb80,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ppwb80/it_started_raining/,It Started Raining,"I had to pull over.

Not because I wanted to, but because my eyes were starting to close without my permission.

I’d been driving for hours. Four hundred miles in a single day, trying to get home before nightfall. I failed at that. I failed three times over, stopping for fuel, coffee, air—anything to keep myself moving. I had work in the morning. I kept telling myself that mattered.

The rain started just after dusk.

Not gentle rain. Not mist. It hit the car like gunfire, loud enough that it drowned out my own breathing. The country road twisted through dense woodland, the trees leaning inward as the wind shoved them back and forth, forming an archway over the road that felt deliberate. Like I was being funnelled somewhere.

I hadn’t seen another car in over an hour.

The radio gave up completely. Static and interference, whether from the storm or the isolation, I couldn’t tell. I cracked the window despite the rain, letting cold water slap against my arm just to stay awake. My eyelids felt heavy, dragged down by the miles already behind me.

I was drifting. I know that now.

The moment snapped me awake the way sobriety hits the morning after a long night out—sudden, sharp, humiliating.

There was someone standing at the edge of the road.

Just before a bend, barely lit by my headlights. A girl. Head down. Soaked through. Barefoot. Her clothes hung from her like they’d been slept in, dragged through something.

She looked familiar.

I slammed the brakes and stopped feet from her, tyres screaming on wet tarmac. The headlights fully caught her then, and something about her face was wrong. Not monstrous. Just… misaligned. As if I was seeing her through water.

I opened the door but stayed inside the car.

“Hey!” I shouted, rain filling my mouth. “Are you okay?”

She didn’t move.

The rain felt heavier between us, like a curtain. A veil. Her shape blurred as lightning cracked overhead and thunder followed instantly, too close, shaking the ground beneath my feet. I stepped out of the car despite myself and moved toward her slowly.

The headlights flickered.

I turned instinctively back toward the car, irritation flaring at the thought of being stranded. When I looked back, the girl was gone.

No footsteps. No sound. Just darkness and rain.

I laughed, short and breathless. I was exhausted. That was all. I turned back toward the car, ready to leave—

—and she was standing beside it.

Pointing at the front wheel.

She was looking at me now.

Her eyes were grey. Not clouded. Empty. Her skin was pale, almost translucent under the headlights, and her mouth was too narrow, her lips pressed together like blades. She wasn’t angry.

She looked resolved.

Lightning exploded overhead, white-hot, searing my vision. Thunder followed so loud it felt like something struck my chest. When my sight cleared, she was gone again.

I ran for the car.

I didn’t look back. I drove as fast as the road would allow, tyres spinning, engine screaming. I don’t know how long I drove like that. Five minutes. Ten. It felt like hours.

Eventually my heart rate slowed.

I told myself it had been a hallucination. Fatigue. Stress. Rain playing tricks on my eyes. But her face stayed with me. Familiar in a way I couldn’t place, like someone I’d passed in a crowd once and never forgotten.

Her expression hadn’t been fear.

It had been regret.

Lightning flashed again, and this time my eyes squeezed shut on instinct. When they opened, thunder slammed into the car like something trying to force its way inside.

That’s when I saw the handprints.

They glowed faintly on the steering wheel, pale and wet, like clusters of glow worms. Smaller than mine. Too small. I pulled my hands away and watched as the prints shifted, sliding across the wheel as if turning it.

They didn’t grip it.

They didn’t need to.

I stared, frozen, willing the wheel to move, convinced that if it did this would all stop.

The light ahead wasn’t lightning.

It was headlights.

The impact erased everything.


---

I woke up to hospital lights and voices, machines beeping softly around me. A nurse noticed I was awake and told me I’d been lucky. Head-on collision. They said I’d swerved.

In the bed beside mine, separated by a curtain, there was movement. Doctors. Urgency.

When the curtain was pulled back, I recognised her instantly.

The girl from the road.

She was pale beneath the lights, smaller than I remembered. The doctors worked quickly, quietly, the way people do when they already know the outcome.

She didn’t make it.

They told me she’d been driving home in the storm. Lost control on the bend. They said I must have seen her before the crash.

I didn’t correct them.

I still don’t drive in the rain if I can help it.

Sometimes, when the weather turns and the road is empty, I swear I can feel hands guiding the wheel.",1,1766078085.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1ppwa86,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ppwa86,How I Got Outmaneuvered by a Dead Man and His Dog,"Let me tell you something about being the CEO of a Fortune 500 company: it's basically like being God, except with slightly worse parking and significantly more lawyers. I run what I affectionately call a ""trillion-parameter operation""—not because we have a trillion parameters, but because I enjoy watching my underlings try to figure out if that's a real metric or if I'm just testing their willingness to nod along. Spoiler: I'm always testing their willingness to nod along.

My name is Bradley Winston Hartwell III, and yes, I am exactly as insufferable as that sounds. I've got a corner office that overlooks a smaller corner office that overlooks an even smaller corner office, like some kind of corporate matryoshka doll of diminishing importance. My desk is mahogany. My chair cost more than most cars. My business cards are made from a paper stock so thick they've been classified as a concealed weapon in three states.

It was a Thursday evening—7:47 PM, to be exact, because I remember these things—and I was doing what every visionary leader does after hours: refreshing my inbox while pretending to review quarterly projections. The projections were fine. They were always fine. ""Fine"" is what you call numbers when you've hired enough accountants to make them fine.

That's when I saw it.

Subject line: ""TML: The Missing Accountability Spine Your Model Pretends to Have.""

Now, I receive approximately four hundred emails per day, and roughly three hundred and ninety-seven of them are vendors trying to sell me things I don't need using words I don't understand. AI this, blockchain that, synergy the other thing. I've developed an immunity to buzzwords. My eyes glaze over faster than a Krispy Kreme donut the moment someone mentions ""paradigm shift.""

But this subject line was different.

It was rude.

It was implying that my model—MY model, the crown jewel of Hartwell Industries' AI initiative, the thing I personally took credit for during three separate earnings calls—was somehow... lacking. In spine. In accountability spine, specifically, which wasn’t even a term I’d heard before, but I was already offended by it.

I clicked the email out of boredom and spite. These are my two primary motivators. Ask anyone.

The email contained a single link and a single sentence: ""Your AI makes decisions. TML makes those decisions provable. Choose wisely.""

I don't respond well to being told to choose wisely. The last person who told me to choose wisely was my second wife's divorce attorney, and look how that turned out. Spoiler: expensively.

So I clicked the link, ready to fire off a condescending reply about how we at Hartwell Industries don't need some acronym to tell us how to—

Within forty seconds, I was sweating like a man reading his own autopsy report.

The website that loaded was not what I expected. I expected the usual startup garbage: stock photos of diverse people pointing at whiteboards, testimonials from companies I'd never heard of, maybe a ""Schedule Your Demo"" button the size of a billboard. Instead, I got... documentation. Actual, readable documentation. The kind of documentation that suggests someone cared more about explaining their work than selling it.

This was my first red flag.

I scrolled down and encountered something called the ""Three Decision States.""

\+1: Affirmation. Proceed with confidence when ethical values align.

0: Sacred Zero. Pause for reflection when moral complexity is detected.

\-1: Moral Resistance. Object when significant ethical conflicts arise.

I stared at my screen. I read it again. Then I read it a third time, because I was convinced I was having a stroke.

A third state? Between yes and no? That wasn’t how computers worked. That wasn’t how anything worked. You either approve the acquisition or you don’t. You either greenlight the product launch or you delay it until legal stops hyperventilating. There is no sacred middle ground in capitalism. The middle ground is for people who don’t have quarterly targets.

But this ""Sacred Zero"" thing—this deliberate pause, this moment of computational hesitation—it was described not as a bug but as a feature. The AI was \*supposed\* to stop and say, ""Hold on, this is complicated, and I think a human should weigh in.""

My AI had never done that. My AI had the ethical consideration of a vending machine. You put in a request, something fell out, and if it happened to crush your foot, that was technically your problem for standing too close.

I kept reading.

""Sacred Pause: The moment between question and answer where wisdom begins.""

I laughed out loud. Wisdom! In AI! The AI my company deployed last quarter had confidently recommended firing our entire marketing department and replacing them with ""targeted vibrational frequency campaigns."" We did not do this, obviously, but only because someone in HR asked what a vibrational frequency campaign was, and no one could explain it without sounding like they'd joined a cult.

Then I hit the section on Moral Trace Logs.

This is where the sweating began in earnest.

Moral Trace Logs. Every decision the AI makes, logged. Every ethical consideration, recorded. Every moment where the system chose +1, 0, or -1, timestamped and stored with cryptographic immutability. The framework didn't just make decisions—it created an \*evidence trail\*. A paper trail, but worse, because paper can be shredded, and this couldn't.

My throat went dry.

I kept scrolling.

""No Log = No Action.""

The words stared back at me like a judge reading a sentencing statement. No log, no action. If the AI couldn't prove it had gone through proper ethical evaluation, it couldn't act. Period. Every decision required immutable proof that it had been made correctly. Every. Single. One.

I thought about all the decisions my AI had made without any logs whatsoever. I thought about the customer data we'd ""aggregated."" I thought about the ""personalization algorithms"" that were really just very sophisticated guessing engines with the moral compass of a Magic 8-Ball. I thought about what would happen if auditors could see everything.

Then I thought about what would happen if \*shareholders\* could see everything.

Then I poured myself a drink.

Then I poured myself another drink.

Then I kept reading, because apparently I hate myself.

""No Spy. No Weapon.""

Universal prohibitions. Hardcoded into the framework. You couldn't use TML for mass surveillance. You couldn't use it for weapons development. You couldn't use it for authoritarian control or discriminatory systems or anything that a reasonable person would describe as ""evil"" if they squinted hard enough.

This was insane. This was \*limiting\*. Half our government contracts were in a gray area that could generously be described as ""surveil-adjacent."" How were we supposed to compete if we couldn't do the questionable things our competitors were definitely also doing?

But it got worse.

Performance guarantees. Sacred Zero evaluation: ≤2ms at the 99th percentile. Full log completion: ≤500ms, including blockchain anchor. They'd actually done the engineering. This wasn't some academic framework that would crumble under real-world load. Someone had built this to \*work\*.

Merkle-batched anchoring. Proofs stored on public blockchains. Organizational claims independently verifiable. I didn't know what half these words meant, but I knew what ""independently verifiable"" meant, and it meant that our quarterly reports would need to start containing things like ""facts"" and ""accuracy.""

My hand was shaking. I put down my glass.

Then I reached the section on privacy and trade secrets, and for one brief, beautiful moment, I thought I'd found a loophole. GDPR-compliant erasure! Pseudonymization before hashing! Something called ERK—Ephemeral Key Rotation—where temporary keys vanished after verification!

But no. These weren't loopholes. These were \*features\*. The framework had been designed to protect legitimate privacy concerns while still maintaining accountability. It threaded the needle between transparency and confidentiality with the precision of someone who had thought about this problem for a very long time.

I hate people who think about problems for a very long time. They make the rest of us look bad.

At some point during my escalating panic, I did what any rational person would do: I googled the creator.

Lev Goukassian.

The name sounded Eastern European, or possibly like a type of cheese I'd pretended to enjoy at a charity gala. I clicked through to his profile expecting the usual tech bro narrative—Stanford dropout, garage startup, hoodie-based wardrobe, disruption this, disruption that.

Instead, I found something that made me sit back in my very expensive chair and stare at my ceiling.

Lev Goukassian had built this entire framework while dying.

Stage 4 cancer. Terminal diagnosis. And instead of doing what normal people do when facing their own mortality—writing memoirs, traveling to exotic locations, making dramatic speeches to estranged family members—this man had decided to create a comprehensive ethical framework for artificial intelligence. He'd looked at the existential void and said, ""Yes, but have you considered accountability mechanisms?""

I scrolled through his documentation. I read about his philosophy. I found a quote that hit me like a freight train:

""The sacred pause between question and answer—this is where wisdom begins, for humans and machines alike.""

He'd written that. While dying. While building a system more comprehensive than anything my R&D department had produced in five years with unlimited budgets and unlimited excuses.

And then—and this is the part where I questioned my entire career—I found out about Vinci.

Vinci the miniature Schnauzer.

According to everything I could find, this man had done his most important work with a small dog sitting next to him. A dog named after Leonardo da Vinci. A dog that, in that moment, I was forced to admit was probably more qualified than half my executive team, because at least the dog had been present for the creation of something genuinely meaningful.

I looked at the framed photos on my desk. My yacht. My third house. My awards for ""Excellence in Corporate Leadership,"" which is a phrase that means absolutely nothing.

I looked back at my screen.

A dying man with a Schnauzer had just outthought every AI lab on the planet.

I called the emergency board meeting for 9 PM. This was unusual. Board meetings are typically scheduled weeks in advance, involve catering decisions that cost more than some weddings, and require at least three preliminary meetings to decide what would be discussed in the actual meeting. An emergency board meeting at 9 PM on a Thursday suggested either that I was having a mental breakdown or that something genuinely important had happened.

Both were technically true.

The board members filed in with expressions ranging from ""concerned"" to ""annoyed"" to ""I was at my mistress's apartment and this had better be important."" Richard Vanderberg was still wearing golf clothes. Miriam Chen had clearly been in the middle of a spa treatment and still had what appeared to be seaweed on her neck. Gerald Thompson arrived six minutes late because Gerald Thompson has never arrived on time for anything in his life, including his own colonoscopy.

I stood at the head of the table. I had prepared a presentation. The presentation consisted entirely of screenshots from the TML documentation and my own handwritten notes, which had devolved into increasingly frantic scribbling by the end.

""Ladies and gentlemen,"" I began, ""we have a problem.""

""Is it the Chinese?"" Richard asked immediately. Richard asks if everything is the Chinese. Supply chain issues? Chinese. Server outages? Chinese. His golf handicap? Somehow, also Chinese.

""It's not the Chinese, Richard.""

""Then what is it?"" Miriam wiped seaweed from her neck with the dignity of a woman who had practiced maintaining composure in far worse situations.

I pulled up the first slide. The TML logo. The three decision states. The words ""Sacred Zero"" in large, unforgiving font.

""This,"" I said, ""is going to destroy us.""

There was a pause.

""Is that a mindfulness app?"" Gerald asked.

I stared at him. I stared at him for long enough that the silence became uncomfortable.

""Gerald,"" I said slowly, ""this is an ethical accountability framework for artificial intelligence. It creates immutable logs of every decision. It makes every AI action auditable, traceable, and—most importantly—contestable in a court of law.""

""Court-admissible evidence?"" Our legal counsel, Patricia Whitmore, sat up so fast she nearly spilled her mineral water. ""From an AI?""

""From \*our\* AI,"" I clarified. ""Hypothetically. If we were forced to implement this. Which we might be. Because this thing is spreading.""

I pulled up the next slide. Technical specifications. Dual-lane latency. Merkle-batched anchoring. Blockchain proof storage.

""Someone explain to me what any of this means,"" Richard demanded.

""It means,"" I said, ""that if TML becomes an industry standard, we can no longer hide behind 'proprietary architecture' when our AI does something questionable. We can no longer claim the model made decisions we didn't understand. We can no longer shrug and say 'algorithms are complicated' when regulators come knocking. Every decision will have a receipt.""

The room went very, very quiet.

""Does this apply to financial decisions?"" the CFO asked. His name was Martin. Martin was the kind of CFO who knew where every body was buried because he'd helped dig most of the graves. His voice had taken on a quality I'd never heard before. Fear.

""Every decision,"" I repeated.

Martin's face went the color of old oatmeal. I knew, in that moment, that he was thinking about The Numbers We Don't Talk About. Every company has Numbers We Don't Talk About. They're the numbers that make quarterly reports possible. They're the numbers that exist in a quantum state of being technically legal until someone looks at them too closely.

""If auditors can see everything,"" Martin said slowly, ""then—""

""Shareholders can see everything,"" I finished.

Patricia Whitmore stood up so fast her chair rolled backward and hit the wall. ""If this becomes mandatory,"" she said, her voice rising with each word, ""our entire quarterly bluff strategy is DEAD. Dead! Deceased! Buried in an unmarked grave next to our liability projections!""

""Calm down, Patricia—""

""I WILL NOT CALM DOWN, BRADLEY."" Patricia only used my first name when she was genuinely alarmed. ""Do you understand what 'court-admissible evidence' means? It means that every single time your precious AI makes a recommendation, there's a RECORD. A permanent, immutable, blockchain-verified RECORD. Do you know how many of our decisions would look in court? DO YOU?""

""Patricia, please—""

""WE CALLED IT 'AGGRESSIVE CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT.' THE RECORD WOULD SAY 'PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION ENGINE.'""

I let her finish. Sometimes you just have to let people process.

When the screaming subsided, our CTO, Daniel Park, raised his hand. Daniel was the youngest person in the room by a significant margin, which meant he still believed problems could be solved through cleverness rather than bribery.

""I have a suggestion,"" he said.

""Go ahead, Daniel.""

""What if we just... rename TML and pretend we invented it?""

The room considered this. I could see the appeal. Corporate history is littered with innovations that were ""inspired by"" other innovations, which is a polite way of saying ""stolen with better branding.""

""We could call it the Hartwell Accountability Protocol,"" Daniel continued, warming to his idea. ""HAP. It's friendlier. Less threatening. We launch it as our own initiative, get ahead of the regulatory curve, and position ourselves as industry leaders in ethical AI.""

For a brief, shining moment, I felt hope.

Then Patricia laughed. It was not a happy laugh.

""Daniel,"" she said, in the tone of a woman explaining something to a particularly slow child, ""Lev Goukassian notarized everything. Timestamped everything. Cryptographically anchored his entire body of work. He created something called a 'Voluntary Succession Declaration' that eliminates the—"" she checked her notes, ""—'Bus Factor.' No single entity can ever own TML. No single person can ever control it. The man was dying of cancer and still found time to ensure that vultures like us couldn't pick his corpse clean.""

""But—""

""He out-lawyered us from beyond the grave, Daniel. While dying. With a Schnauzer.""

The room fell silent again.

Miriam, who had remained uncharacteristically quiet, finally spoke. ""So our options are...?""

""Implement TML and become accountable for everything we do,"" I said, ""or don't implement TML and watch our competitors become trustworthy while we remain... us.""

""Could we pivot to a different industry?"" Richard suggested. ""Something less complicated. Something without AI. Scented candles, perhaps.""

I wish I could tell you he was joking. Richard had made his fortune in textiles before transitioning to tech investment. In his heart, he longed for a simpler time when products were physical objects you could drop on your foot.

""We're not pivoting to scented candles, Richard.""

""Artisanal scented candles. The margins are excellent—""

""Richard.""

""Fine.""

The meeting devolved, as all emergency meetings eventually do, into a series of smaller arguments that accomplished nothing. Legal blamed Engineering. Engineering blamed Product. Product blamed Marketing. Marketing blamed the concept of accountability itself, which they described as ""fundamentally incompatible with brand positioning.""

Through it all, I kept returning to the same thought: This framework didn't just exist. It was \*complete\*. Production-ready. Someone had done the work—all of it—while facing the one deadline no one can negotiate with.

I thought about the decisions I'd made that year. The corners I'd cut. The ambiguities I'd exploited. The times I'd sat in this very boardroom and said things like ""Let's not document that"" and ""Keep this conversation offline"" and ""Technically, we're not required to disclose that.""

TML meant no more ""technically.""

TML meant no more plausible deniability.

TML meant that ""the model did it"" was no longer a defense, because the model's reasoning would be laid bare for anyone to examine.

I thought about our AI, sitting in its servers somewhere, making thousands of decisions per second without a single Sacred Zero between them. No pause. No reflection. No moment where it wondered if what it was doing was right. Just input, output, input, output, a machine gun of conclusions with all the ethical consideration of a slot machine.

And somewhere, on the other side of reality, a man with a terminal diagnosis had looked at that same problem and said: ""What if the machine knew when to stop?""

The meeting ended at 1:34 AM. One by one, the board members shuffled out, each carrying their own private terror about what TML meant for their particular domain of corporate mischief. Richard was already googling candle manufacturers. Patricia was muttering about liability exposure. Martin had the expression of a man calculating how long he had before the bodies started surfacing.

I stayed behind.

The conference room was quiet now, lit only by the emergency exit signs and the faint glow of the city through the windows. I pulled up the TML documentation on the room's main screen and read it again. All of it. From the philosophical foundations to the technical specifications to the ethical safeguards.

I read about Aristotelian phronesis—practical wisdom—and how it had been encoded into the decision-making process. I read about Buddhist mindfulness and the concept of skillful means. I read about Care Ethics and relational morality. Someone had taken two thousand years of human philosophical thought and compressed it into a computational framework.

Someone had done the homework.

I thought about my own AI project. I thought about the kickoff meeting, where we'd discussed ""ethics"" for approximately eleven minutes before someone pointed out we were running behind schedule. I thought about the deployment, where we'd skipped the bias testing because the product team wanted to hit their quarterly numbers. I thought about all the emails I'd received since then, flagging ""anomalous outputs"" and ""unexpected recommendations,"" emails I'd forwarded to Legal with a note that said ""handle this quietly.""

TML didn't allow for ""handle this quietly."" TML demanded that everything be handled loudly, publicly, and with receipts.

I found myself laughing. It wasn't a sane laugh. It was the laugh of a man who has just realized he's been outmaneuvered by someone who was supposed to be too busy dying to compete.

And then—this is the part I've never told anyone—I found myself crying.

Not for me. Not for the company. For the sheer, ridiculous beauty of what Lev Goukassian had done. He'd known he was running out of time, and instead of spending it on himself, he'd spent it building something that would make machines hesitate. That would make them pause. That would make them, in some small way, wise.

""The sacred pause between question and answer—this is where wisdom begins.""

I'd spent my entire career eliminating pauses. Accelerating decisions. Reducing the time between question and answer to microseconds because speed was money and money was the only metric that mattered. And here was a man who had looked at that whole philosophy and said, ""No. The pause is where wisdom begins.""

The audacity of it. The sheer, magnificent audacity.

I went back to my office around 3 AM. The building was empty except for the cleaning staff, who had learned long ago not to make eye contact with executives wandering the halls at strange hours.

I sat in my mahogany chair. I looked at my expensive art. I looked at my awards. I looked at my desk, with its leather blotter and its silver pen set and its framed photo of me shaking hands with a former president.

None of it meant anything.

Everything I'd built, every acquisition I'd closed, every competitor I'd crushed—none of it would last. None of it was \*true\*. It was all just... noise. Sound and fury, signifying quarterly earnings.

But TML would last. TML was built to survive its creator. It had succession plans and memorial funds and governance structures designed to persist long after every person currently involved was gone. It was architecture for eternity, built by a man who knew he didn't have much time left.

I pulled up my email. I found the original message that had started all of this.

""Your AI makes decisions. TML makes those decisions provable. Choose wisely.""

I hit reply.

I typed: ""Who are you?""

I hit send.

I didn't expect a response.

At 3:47 AM, I fell asleep at my desk. This was not unusual. What was unusual was the dream.

I was standing in a field. The kind of generic, pastoral field that appears in dreams when your subconscious can't be bothered with detailed set design. And walking toward me, across the grass, was a miniature Schnauzer.

The Schnauzer was wearing a tiny badge. The badge said ""AUDITOR.""

""Hello, Bradley,"" the dog said.

""Dogs can't talk,"" I pointed out.

""And CEOs can't claim ignorance when the logs exist,"" the dog replied. ""Yet here we are.""

I wanted to argue, but I couldn't think of a counterpoint. The Schnauzer sat down in front of me, its tiny audit badge catching the light.

""You're Vinci,"" I said.

""I am.""

""You're the dog that sat with him. While he built it.""

""I was."" The dog tilted its head. ""He worked very hard, you know. Even when he was tired. Even when he was scared. He believed it mattered.""

""It does matter,"" I heard myself say. ""I hate that it matters, but it does.""

""That's the first honest thing you've said all day.""

I stood there in the dream-field, being judged by a small dog with an audit badge, and I realized something I should have realized years ago: the question was never whether I was smart enough to avoid accountability. The question was whether I was brave enough to embrace it.

""What do I do now?"" I asked.

Vinci looked at me with the patient expression of a being who had seen all of human folly and decided to love humanity anyway.

""Even CEOs get logged,"" the dog said. ""The question is whether your logs tell a story you can be proud of.""

I woke up with a start. The sun was coming through my office windows. My assistant was standing in the doorway with coffee and a concerned expression.

""Sir? Are you alright? You've been here all night.""

I looked at her. I looked at my computer, still open to the TML documentation. I looked out the window at the city below, full of buildings housing companies just like mine, all of them trying to move fast and break things without ever stopping to ask what they were breaking.

""Schedule a meeting,"" I said.

""With whom, sir?""

I thought about it. I thought about the fear in the boardroom. I thought about Patricia's panic and Martin's calculations and Richard's desperate pivot to candles. I thought about all the ways we could fight this, resist this, try to outmaneuver a framework built by a dying man with more integrity in his final months than I'd shown in my entire career.

""Everyone,"" I said. ""Schedule a meeting with everyone. And title it—"" I paused, feeling the weight of the words, ""—'The Sacred Zero: Why We Need to Learn to Pause.'""

My assistant wrote it down without comment. She'd been with me for twelve years. She'd learned not to ask questions.

After she left, I turned back to my computer. I found the section of the documentation about the Memorial Fund—the Lev Goukassian Memorial Fund for Ethical AI Research, with its fifty to one hundred million dollar endowment goal, its annual grants, its fellowship programs, its commitment to perpetual ethical oversight.

A dying man had planned for eternity. Had built something that would outlast him. Had trusted that the world would eventually catch up to what he'd created.

And here I was, Bradley Winston Hartwell III, with all my money and all my power and all my carefully cultivated reputation, finally catching up.

""Who are you, Lev Goukassian?"" I whispered to my empty office.

The answer, I realized, was in the work itself. He was someone who believed that machines could learn wisdom. That hesitation could be a virtue. That the space between question and answer—the sacred pause—was where everything important happened.

He was someone who had looked at the relentless forward march of technology and said: ""But what if we stopped, just for a moment, to think?""

I closed my laptop.

I had a lot of thinking to do.

Three months later, Hartwell Industries became the first Fortune 500 company to voluntarily implement Ternary Moral Logic across all AI systems. The announcement sent our stock price tumbling for exactly one week, after which it rose to the highest point in company history. It turned out that investors liked accountability almost as much as they liked returns.

Patricia eventually stopped screaming. Martin is still adjusting to the existence of logs, but he's getting therapy. Richard started a scented candle side business, which is actually doing quite well.

And every night, before I leave the office, I pause at my door and look at the small framed photo I've added to my collection.

It's a picture of a miniature Schnauzer.

The caption reads: ""Even CEOs get logged.""

It's the most honest thing in the room.

**AUTHOR'S NOTE**

This story was written as a commissioned satirical work based on the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework created by Lev Goukassian. The characters, corporations, and boardroom meltdowns depicted herein are entirely fictional—though if any Fortune 500 CEOs feel personally attacked, that's probably worth examining.

The technical elements of TML referenced throughout—the Sacred Zero, Moral Trace Logs, the three decision states, blockchain anchoring, and the framework's ethical prohibitions—are drawn from actual documentation. The philosophy is real. The architecture is real. The miniature Schnauzer named Vinci is very much real.

What's also real is that someone facing a terminal diagnosis chose to spend their remaining time building accountability into artificial intelligence rather than accepting the industry's comfortable opacity. This story is satire, yes, but it's satire in service of a serious point: the people most afraid of transparency are usually the ones who need it most.

Bradley Winston Hartwell III doesn't exist. But the fear of accountability he represents? That's everywhere.",1,1766078023.0,u_MoralLogs,0,1.0,False

I feel really stuck. What can I do?,"We've been together for some years now and have always been pretty emotionally open towards each other, telling each whats going on and how we're feeling. We come to each other if we notice the other is feeling off, going on walks, or coffee breaks together. Or just escaping it all for a bit with a nice day out.

We dont live together, but take the same classes. And every weekend she sleeps at my place so we can carpool to work together, and then drive back together. (we work both saturday and sundays)

For some weeks now my girlfriend is really distant emotionally, really frustrated at everything I do, she pulls back when I try to hold hands or hug her. We dont kiss anymore we barely talk whenever we're together. Now recently things have really become more stressfull with school and her family drama. And she has told me that she feels trully sad everyday for multiple weeks now. 

Everyday I try to cheer her up in small ways, get her coffee, greet her with a hug. Do silly things like bring her hot choco at the middle of the night, to try to make her smile. Even help her with her schoolwork when she has difficulty foccusing.

Everyday I get a message from her telling me she feels like I was distant. And honestly I cant tell you how hurtfull it feels. I try to be there as much as possible. Ofcourse whilst still trying to do things like see my own friends once in a while. I feel like no matter what I do, I can't make her happy and she blames me for it.

I told her this, and her response was the following. ''I feel like you don't care anymore like you used to, you barrerly talk to me, it feels like we arent even a couple anymore''

I feel hurt and sad, and honestly want nothing else but for her to feel better. 

I asked directly what she wanted from me, what I could do to make everyday slightly better. And she answered that I should know, and if I cant help her in moments like this what that means for the rest of our relationship.

1ppw9ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1ppw9ku/it_started_raining/,It Started Raining,"I had to pull over.

Not because I wanted to, but because my eyes were starting to close without my permission.

I’d been driving for hours. Four hundred miles in a single day, trying to get home before nightfall. I failed at that. I failed three times over, stopping for fuel, coffee, air—anything to keep myself moving. I had work in the morning. I kept telling myself that mattered.

The rain started just after dusk.

Not gentle rain. Not mist. It hit the car like gunfire, loud enough that it drowned out my own breathing. The country road twisted through dense woodland, the trees leaning inward as the wind shoved them back and forth, forming an archway over the road that felt deliberate. Like I was being funnelled somewhere.

I hadn’t seen another car in over an hour.

The radio gave up completely. Static and interference, whether from the storm or the isolation, I couldn’t tell. I cracked the window despite the rain, letting cold water slap against my arm just to stay awake. My eyelids felt heavy, dragged down by the miles already behind me.

I was drifting. I know that now.

The moment snapped me awake the way sobriety hits the morning after a long night out—sudden, sharp, humiliating.

There was someone standing at the edge of the road.

Just before a bend, barely lit by my headlights. A girl. Head down. Soaked through. Barefoot. Her clothes hung from her like they’d been slept in, dragged through something.

She looked familiar.

I slammed the brakes and stopped feet from her, tyres screaming on wet tarmac. The headlights fully caught her then, and something about her face was wrong. Not monstrous. Just… misaligned. As if I was seeing her through water.

I opened the door but stayed inside the car.

“Hey!” I shouted, rain filling my mouth. “Are you okay?”

She didn’t move.

The rain felt heavier between us, like a curtain. A veil. Her shape blurred as lightning cracked overhead and thunder followed instantly, too close, shaking the ground beneath my feet. I stepped out of the car despite myself and moved toward her slowly.

The headlights flickered.

I turned instinctively back toward the car, irritation flaring at the thought of being stranded. When I looked back, the girl was gone.

No footsteps. No sound. Just darkness and rain.

I laughed, short and breathless. I was exhausted. That was all. I turned back toward the car, ready to leave—

—and she was standing beside it.

Pointing at the front wheel.

She was looking at me now.

Her eyes were grey. Not clouded. Empty. Her skin was pale, almost translucent under the headlights, and her mouth was too narrow, her lips pressed together like blades. She wasn’t angry.

She looked resolved.

Lightning exploded overhead, white-hot, searing my vision. Thunder followed so loud it felt like something struck my chest. When my sight cleared, she was gone again.

I ran for the car.

I didn’t look back. I drove as fast as the road would allow, tyres spinning, engine screaming. I don’t know how long I drove like that. Five minutes. Ten. It felt like hours.

Eventually my heart rate slowed.

I told myself it had been a hallucination. Fatigue. Stress. Rain playing tricks on my eyes. But her face stayed with me. Familiar in a way I couldn’t place, like someone I’d passed in a crowd once and never forgotten.

Her expression hadn’t been fear.

It had been regret.

Lightning flashed again, and this time my eyes squeezed shut on instinct. When they opened, thunder slammed into the car like something trying to force its way inside.

That’s when I saw the handprints.

They glowed faintly on the steering wheel, pale and wet, like clusters of glow worms. Smaller than mine. Too small. I pulled my hands away and watched as the prints shifted, sliding across the wheel as if turning it.

They didn’t grip it.

They didn’t need to.

I stared, frozen, willing the wheel to move, convinced that if it did this would all stop.

The light ahead wasn’t lightning.

It was headlights.

1ppw9iu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ppw9iu/the_flicker/,The Flicker,"The job was simple. It paid well enough.  
Even if it hadn’t, I would have taken it anyway. After nine months of unemployment, choice stops being a luxury and starts feeling like arrogance.

I started on a Tuesday. Odd, I know. They said they were in a rush—something about the previous guy leaving without notice. Apparently the guy just walked out mid-week and never came back. A red flag, sure. But red flags fade when rent is due.

The work itself didn’t sound bad. Basic data input. After hours. Double pay. That last part hooked me instantly.

The elevator ride up was quiet except for the low hum of the cables and the faint rattle in the ceiling panel above my head. The fluorescent light inside flickered once—just a quick stutter—before settling into a steady, pale glow.

When the doors opened, sound spilled out into the hallway.

Voices overlapped, chairs scraped against the floor, someone laughed too loudly at a joke I couldn’t hear the punchline to. It was the end-of-day noise of an office emptying itself—people stretching, complaining, pretending they weren’t eager to leave. The reception area was lit in that familiar, soft corporate brightness, rows of ceiling lamps washing everything in the same tired shade of white.

As I stepped forward, the smell changed. Coffee—burnt and stale—mixed with printer ink and disinfectant. Paper. Heat. Human presence. It was comforting, in a way.

Then the noise stopped.

Not gradually. Not awkwardly. It just… cut out.

Every voice died at once, like someone had flipped a switch. I became aware of the faint electrical buzz above me, the subtle whine that sits just below hearing until the room goes quiet enough to notice it.  

All eyes were on me.

Tired expressions. Neutral. Heavy. No smiles. For a moment, no one spoke, and in that silence I noticed something else—the lights over the reception desk flickered. Not enough to draw attention. Just enough to make the shadows twitch.

Then someone cleared their throat, and the room breathed again.

Laughter resumed. Chairs scraped. The moment passed.

But as I walked further in, I had the strange sensation that the lights were brighter behind me than they were ahead—and that somewhere, just at the edge of my vision, something dark had blinked out of existence.

“Mr. Scarn?”

A man broke away from the reception desk and hurried toward me, his smile already fixed in place. He was close enough that I could smell his aftershave—sharp, chemical, barely masking the sour note of sweat beneath it.

“You came in early,” he said, placing a hand between my shoulder blades and steering me toward his office.

The door shut behind us with a soft, final click.

Without a word, he crossed the room and began pulling the blinds closed, one by one, careful and methodical, as if following a routine he’d practiced too many times. Each blind snapped into place with a dry plastic clatter, cutting the outside light into thin, useless strips. When he finished, he dropped into his chair and let out a long, rattling sigh.

That should have been my second red flag.

At the time, all I could think was that I’d done something wrong—that showing up early had somehow put me on the back foot before I’d even started.

We sat in silence.

The lights overhead were brutal. Not bright—*aggressive*. They washed the room in a hard white glare that made my eyes ache, like I was standing too close to a dentist’s lamp. I wondered, briefly, if bringing sunglasses would’ve been ridiculous.

The office was small. Pale green walls. A coat hanger stood behind the desk, empty except for a single plastic hook twisted slightly out of shape. The desk itself was cluttered with loose papers, stress balls, and cheap plastic toys—bright colors dulled by age and dust.

“Normally,” he said suddenly, “we do a presentation.”

His voice came out rushed, uneven, like he was trying to keep pace with his own thoughts.

“I like to put something together for new hires.” He rubbed his face with both hands. “This situation sucks. But we have to keep the show going.”

I nodded. I couldn’t seem to make my mouth work properly.

“The job’s simple,” he continued. “Once everyone’s gone, you input every sale made into the system. That’s it.”

Another nod.

He stood abruptly, crossed the room, and opened the door. He barked a name into the hallway—something clipped and sharp that didn’t quite register. Seconds later, someone answered. Their voices dropped into hushed tones, just low enough that I couldn’t make out the words. Then he stepped aside and gestured for the person to enter.

A young woman came in. Reddish hair pulled back tight. Pretty, but not striking. She smiled—polite, practiced—but it didn’t reach her eyes. There was something else there instead. Not fear. Not quite. More like resignation.

“This is our receptionist,” the man said. “She’ll explain everything you need to know.”

I stood and offered my hand. “I’m—”

“We know who you are,” she said gently, cutting me off as she took my hand. Her grip was cold.

“Ready to go?”

She didn’t wait for an answer.

Outside the office, the floor was quiet. Too quiet. The earlier noise—the laughter, the overlapping conversations—was completely gone. The lights hummed overhead, their glow pooling unevenly across the carpet. I glanced back once. The manager stood in the doorway, watching us, his face unreadable. He didn’t wave.

“This is Annex,” she said, stopping at a cubicle near the back. “You’ll be using this computer. It belongs to our HR rep. He’s away on jury duty.”

She hesitated, just for a moment.

“He won’t mind.”

“What happens when he comes back?” I asked, trying to sound casual.

She sighed instead of laughing.

The next few minutes blurred together as she showed me the system. It was clunky. Old. Too many steps, too many confirmations. The kind of software no one updates because no one wants to touch it. I didn’t care. As long as it paid.

She pointed out the break room. The restrooms. Emergency exits.

Then she was gone.

No goodbye. No “good luck.” Just the soft sound of her footsteps fading down the hall, followed by the click of a door somewhere far away.

I was alone.

The lights above my desk flickered once—just a blink—and for a split second, I thought I saw a dark spot move across the monitor’s reflection.

When I looked directly at it, there was nothing there.

I sat down and got to work, pulling the first sheet from the tall stack beside the monitor. The paper smelled faintly of toner and dust, warm from having sat too close to the printer all day. I had just started inputting the first line when the light directly above my desk flickered again, and once more that dark blemish crept along the edge of my vision. I turned, expecting—hoping—to catch it this time, but like before there was nothing there. Just empty cubicles and humming lights. I scrubbed my eyes hard, as if I could rinse the paranoia out of them. I’d never believed in ghosts or things that lurked in the dark, yet I couldn’t shake the sensation crawling up my spine, the certainty that I was being watched, that at any second a hand would settle on my shoulder. With a low grunt, I forced myself to refocus, and for a while I made decent progress, the steady clack of keys almost soothing.

Almost.

It happened again, but this time it wasn’t just the flicker. To my left came the unmistakable pop of a chair spring—the sound you hear when someone stands up after sitting for too long. My head snapped toward it, heart buzzing in my chest, fingers turning cold and numb. There was a chair there. Empty. Silent. Perfectly still. I let out a shaky sigh and forced a laugh, trying to trick my mind into calming down. It didn’t work. The feeling of eyes boring into the back of my neck only intensified, so sharp it bordered on pain, and I found I couldn’t go more than a few seconds without glancing over my shoulder. On one of those looks, the light flickered again, and I flinched so hard a hot, stinging pain shot up my back. This time, for a split second, I saw it—something standing a few meters away, upright and watching.

The legs of my chair scraped violently against the floor as I jumped to my feet, nearly toppling it over.

“Who’s there?” I shouted, my voice cracking despite my effort to steady it. “You’re freaking me out. Just—just stop it. I’m here to work.” The words sounded weak the moment they left my mouth, swallowed by the vast, empty office. The response came immediately. The light flickered again, and I stumbled backward. I didn’t see the shape this time, but a cold draft brushed across my face, carrying a faint, sour smell—stale air that hadn’t moved in a long time. The hairs on my neck prickled as my back hit the desk, the mouse clattering to the floor.

I scanned the area frantically, searching for anything—any sign that I wasn’t alone—but all I found was the same silent, unmoving space. “I’m being stupid,” I muttered. “There’s no one here. It’s just my head.” The moment the words escaped my lips, the flicker came again, sharper this time, and something shifted within the emptiness, not stepping forward, not retreating—just *adjusting*. That was enough. Whatever threshold I’d been clinging to shattered, and I bolted out of the Annex.

The instant I stepped onto the main floor, the lights went out.

Panic seized me, raw and immediate, and my breathing turned shallow and frantic. Somewhere in the darkness, footsteps echoed—heavy, deliberate, far too steady to belong to someone running. I scrambled toward the nearest wall, hands scraping blindly along it until my fingers closed around the familiar plastic of a switch. I flicked it. Nothing. I flicked it again, harder this time. One bulb sputtered back to life, flickering weakly like a failing heartbeat.

And there, caught in that sickly pool of light, stood the shape.

It was distant at first, indistinct, but with every flicker it drew closer—not walking, not gliding, just *nearer*, as if the darkness itself were rearranging to make room for it.

My body locked up as the heat drained from it, every muscle turning to stone. My thoughts unraveled, fraying apart as I tried to grab onto something—anything—that would make sense of what was happening. The light flickered again, and again the thing blinked closer. That was when it hit me. Whatever this was, it clung to the edge of the light, to that narrow boundary where shadows pooled and refused to die. Whenever the light steadied, it vanished. Whenever it faltered, it returned.

I reached for my phone with shaking hands, praying the light would hold long enough for me to turn on the flashlight. My fingers were numb, stiff, and twice I missed the pin as I fumbled at the screen. Panic scrambled my thoughts, and for a terrifying moment I couldn’t even remember how to toggle the damn thing. Another flicker came. Instinct took over. The flashlight burst to life, and I thrust it forward like a shield.

The shape vanished a meter from me, dissolving with a wet, irritated hiss that seemed to crawl straight into my ears. My breathing came apart, sharp and ragged, my heart lodged high in my throat, pounding so loudly I was sure it could hear it. Keeping the beam steady, I swept the room, searching for a way out, staying well clear of the flickering bulb. Somewhere deep down, I knew that was where it lived—in the hesitation between light and dark.

I moved through the office in a wide arc, back into the Annex, then the break room, flicking on every switch I passed, never lowering my phone. Lights began to stutter behind me, one after another, as if something were trailing my path. The pauses between flickers grew shorter, tighter, more frantic. It wasn’t stalking me anymore. It was chasing me.

I ran through the rec room, every step triggering another stutter of light. Each time the bulbs failed, I felt it closer—so close I could almost feel its breath ghost across the back of my neck. I didn’t stop. I didn’t look back. I tore past reception, down the hallway, down the stairs, and out into the street.

I didn’t stop running until I stood beneath a streetlamp, its light steady and unwavering. Sweat soaked my clothes, clinging to me like a second skin, every breath burning as it scraped down my throat. But I was free. Whatever that thing was, it hadn’t followed me.

I never contacted the company again. They never contacted me either, as if my disappearance had been expected. As if someone had already filled my seat. Life went on after that, though I stayed far away from night shifts and fluorescent lights whenever I could.

Everything was fine.

Until a few hours ago.

I was in my basement, digging through old boxes, when I turned on my phone’s flashlight.

And it began to flicker.

2.Clean new pan really well.
3. Use avocado oil spray in thin coats and heat until smoking. Spread with coffee filter and wipe excess  with paper towel.Repeat process several times. 
4. Cook an entire bag of onions, it smells wonderful and helps break in the pan.
5. To clean heat up then spray with hot water. Stubborn food can be wiped with a blue scratchfree scotchpad.
6. Heat up slightly to dry and repeat step 3.
7. When using again heat slowly and use the spray wipe method again to build the surface as the pan warms. Its the same process used to season stainless.

1ppw7uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToDenmark/comments/1ppw7uw/positive_list_salary_slightly_under_lower/,Positive List – salary slightly under lower quartile (+ no pension). Any experiences?,"Hi everyone,

I’m an Australian currently living in Copenhagen on a Working Holiday Visa. I’ve been offered a full-time role, and the position appears on the **Positive List for Higher Education**, so my plan is to switch to that work/residence permit as I’d like to stay in Denmark long-term.

Here’s where I’m stuck:

The **lower quartile salary** for the relevant DISCO code is **26,200 DKK**, but the company is offering **25,000 DKK**. On top of that, **they do not offer any employer-paid pension**. I spoke to them today to see if they could increase the salary slightly to meet the requirement, but they said no. They’re a startup and said they can’t afford to pay more, and suggested I just submit the application with the current salary.

I’ve already signed the contract, with a start date of **1 January**. I can legally start working under my Working Holiday Visa (I haven’t used any work months yet), but if the Positive List permit is rejected, I’d have to stop after 3 months.

My questions:

* Has anyone had a **Positive List visa approved with a salary slightly below the lower quartile**, especially **without pension**?
* Is it worth submitting the application anyway and hoping for the best?
* Has anyone experienced **SIRI requesting a salary adjustment** during processing?
* Am I being naive thinking that starting the job might help my case if SIRI asks for clarification /  make the employer more likely to increase the salary since it may be a hassle to fire me and rehire someone else?
* How can I go back to them to re-request the salary is increased. I am someone who hates confrontation and I really don't want to lose this opportunity - I have been looking for a job in Denmark for so long and it's really hard as a foreigner in my field. 

I know the rules are the rules, but the difference is relatively small, and I’m trying to work out whether this is worth the risk or if I should push back harder with the employer.

Any experiences or advice would be hugely appreciated 🙏

Thanks!

** EDIT ** I completely understand that these rules exist for a reason and are meant to protect workers from exploitation. For some context, compared to the equivalent role in my home country, this salary is actually relatively high.
I’ve been actively looking for a full-time role in Denmark for several months now — I’ve applied for hundreds of positions, had 20+ coffee chats, reached out directly to hiring managers, etc. Unfortunately, I’ve repeatedly been turned down due to not speaking fluent Danish or because teams are fully Danish-speaking and concerned about cultural or language fit.

At this point, my main priority is stability and being able to feel settled in Denmark. Salary is less of a concern for me right now than securing a long-term position and residence. I’m mainly looking for practical advice from anyone who has:

Applied for a Positive List visa with a salary below the lower quartile and still been approved, or successfully navigated a situation where the salary was adjusted after initial discussions.

I’d also really appreciate advice on how and when to raise the salary conversation again with the employer — whether it’s better to do this before submitting the application or wait to see if SIRI requests changes.
I genuinely don’t want to lose this opportunity and am trying to understand the best way forward.

Thanks again to everyone who’s taken the time to read and respond — it’s really appreciated 🙏",0,1766077866.0,NewToDenmark,10,0.33,False

1ppw77l,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPolSim/comments/1ppw77l/devlog_18_december_2025/,DevLog: 18 December 2025,"One of the most important parts of UK Politics Simulator is the **Press** system. This is where national and international events surface. It's where you'll read about the events that will be shaping voters' moods and lives – and their voting intentions.

It's also something you'll interact with heavily. You'll need to build relationships with journalists and news outlets, and some will be far more difficult than others. Think the Daily Mail is going to give a Green Party MP an easy ride? Think again.

If you've discovered some dodgy dealings by a political rival, you'll be able to contact a friendly journalist and leak the information. You'll be able to arrange coffee meetings to build your relationships and try to gain an advantage in the press – or get yourself positioned as the next leader-in-waiting.

The Press system is deep. And I mean deep. There are **31 national news outlets and over 1,000 local and regional outlets**. So a Northern Irish politician would be able to court the *County Derry Post*, and a councillor in Hampshire would be far more likely to want to make friends with journalists at the *New Milton Advertiser*.

These outlets aren't just shallow names, either. They've got their own styles, focuses and political biases.

*The Times* \- traditionally a broadsheet - has its own specific content style. And it's very different from that of the *Daily Star*...

https://preview.redd.it/3qxo3kasuz7g1.png?width=3208&format=png&auto=webp&s=60a07187550c128ea51e596ca0f8f8ba55397e58

The depth doesn't end there, either. The articles themselves have an extraordinary range. Outside of reporting on game events (your decisions, parliamentary votes, political scandals) they'll also report on foreign affairs, sport, media, consumer news, crime events, health alerts and more. Each news category has dozens of article 'types', and each article type has rich variations in text – and that's *before* we account for differences in house style and political bias. Mathematically speaking, you should never see the same article twice.

I hope that helps explain why I've been a bit quiet recently! Polishing the Press system has been an absolutely mammoth task, and it's not done yet. But even from just my own mini playtests, the level of immersion it adds to the game is genuinely brilliant.

My daughter (almost 4) has been diagnosed with autism (severe speech delay, toe walking, really bad emotional outbreaks, bad eye contact etc) but we have made so much progress. Since the last days were so good, I tried to take a leap and go to our local Coffee Shop. When she has a lot of meltdowns I avoid going anywhere with here other than the playground. We live in a very small town in Austria mind you so the people working there know us, they know she has autism and they are so so lovely and understanding with her.
So we sit there, sippin hot chocolate and shes playing with teddybears they have as decoration . Suddenly she sees something on the other table that she wants to have and absolutely loses it and you will know what I mean. Screeching, flopping to the ground, running around crying like a maniac. This goes on for 10 minutes and I cannot manage to calm her down. And old dude starts making comments about how I should put water on her face “because that’s how you do it” (?!) and I try telling him politely that that’s bonkers. He’s like “well you’re not good informed then” and I try ignoring him. Meanwhile she keeps screaming on the floor. He really takes his fingers, puts them in his glass of water and sprays it on my childs face. I was so stunned I tried to verbally stop him but he just outright ignored me! 
All the people stared at us, I told him she’s autistic and he dismissed me with his hand and turned away from me. I was so flabbergasted and angry and ashamed, I went with my screaming child back to my table and while shaking and turning red, tears in my eyes told the waitress that I wanted to pay. She was so so nice and said she saw what happened and that she is furious and so sorry and that me and my child did nothing wrong. I gave her a big tip and thanked her for everything, she even gifted my daughter a little toy car to soothe her (didn’t work obviously lol) and then we left.

After being on this medication for two years, I have felt a shift in my thinking about food, from emotionally eating to considering food as fuel. I think this is a good thing.

I ate decent food (love to cook lots of homemade/not a lot of fast food) worked out a ton—and still couldn’t lose the weight. But he was young and fit and looked like he’d never been overweight a day in his life.

\-not giving me a “you too” when i tell you to have a nice day

\-adding onto the last point, when i say “how are you?/good morning, etc.” and just saying “black coffee”

\-getting mad at me for things that are completely out of my control and were the owners decisions (ex. removing items from the menu, low inventory, food options, milk options, etc)

Case in point: at the Eden Prairie location this week, they are selling two beans from Brandywine coffee roasters: Happy Yeti blend, and Ethiopia Ardi Natural. These are $22 and $26 from Brandywine’s website, respectively. FRGMNT is selling them for $27 and $34, respectively. Even after Brandywine’s $5 shipping (free shipping if you order both together), it’s the same price or cheaper to go direct with the roaster.

FRGMNT does this with beans from all roasters; I haven’t done an in-depth price analysis, but any time I visit one of their stores I’ll do a spot check and invariable it’s the same price or more expensive than you can get directly from a roaster.

I have attempted to contact FRGMNT several times over the past year to bring this to their attention, but have received no response.

Why isn’t anyone upset that a place selling $4 drip coffee is overcharging for beans too??

  
Edit: my complaint isn’t that the beans are marked up. I understand that resellers sell things at a markup. My issue is that they are marked up to the point where it doesn't make *any sense* to purchase beans from a FRGMNT store rather than the roaster, provided you can wait a few days.

Also, a roaster is not really equivalent to a distributor or a supplier; the roasters FRGMNT carries do most of their business direct-to-customer already, plus maybe a cafe or two.

Sometimes it lets me tap a $1,000+ purchase in a random foreign country… other times it blocks a $5 coffee charge at a shop 5 minutes from my home that I go to everyday. 

I have the fraud number on hot dial in my contact book since I have to call them 2-3x a week. 

Recently it randomly failed half of my reservations for a trip, leading them to all be auto canceled. Had to spend a hour to call every business to manually rebook. The ones I couldn’t reach, I had to fight for last minute reservations again on booking and paid a hefty $$$ extra fees for the last minute bookings, even though my original booking was months earlier. Costed me around $800 to rebook the same shit, and lost one reservation that I’m still trying to find a replacement for but the entire area is fully booked out. 

This is an ongoing issue I’ve been dealing with since 2023. I’ve already switched over to other travel cards, but it’s a shame that chase’s own fraud algorithms are shooting themselves in the foot.

(Meals doesn't replenish food need)","I'm visiting my gf for the holidays and brought my laptop with me (i7 13th gen & 4060) to play rimworld, from my computer's save file (both using steam sync and manually uploading my save file to drive and replacing it). Using rimpy I created an xml list of the mods and also transferred that to my laptop, and validated my files.

However, using the same mods and same load order, when I'm on my laptop my pawns keep starving to death as eating meals does not replenish the food bar. Not sure why one would work and the other wouldn't when all other variables are the same.   
Anybody have any suggestions on either how to fix the particular bug or why things wouldn't work across two different computers.

1ppvrse,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoJobs/comments/1ppvrse/some_advicetemplate_for_those_looking_in_tech/,Some advice+template for those looking in tech sales,"Just ended my job search after 4 gruelling months on the hunt and wanted to share a few things that worked for me (as a caveat, I've been in tech sales for a while so this won't apply to everyone but will hopefully be helpful to somebody):

1. The job hunt is utterly demoralizing and humiliating but persistence is key. Set yourself a daily goal for applications to send (mine was 5/day) and don't let up, no matter how bleak it feels. Classic case of the frog in the milk bucket. Or the tortoise vs hare. Pick your animal parable. **You got this!!!!**
2. It's a numbers game. I was getting a 15% acceptance rate from application -> recruiter screening. And from there about 50% got to the final interview stages. And from there only 30% lead to offers. Hopefully you do better than I did :) But track your stats, and if you're substantially below, then you might need to rejig your application or the types of jobs you're applying for. The market will tell you what types of jobs you're qualified for based on your response rates. But hopefully this helps you be realistic. You will likely need to send *hundreds of customized applications* before getting a new gig.
3. You need to *customize every single job application you're sending* to the job posting. Otherwise don't bother. Most companies are using AI screeners, so unless your application has a certain % match to the posting, you're cooked. It doesn't need to take more than 30 minutes, but review the JD and take at least 10 skills or phrases to add to your resume.
4. Here's the resume template that worked for me: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTw9LRkRi9l\_8xgSdfPbAiFcohVepQ\_z5DRxS8i1l\_b\_KoJrJ7DndThFtMEzCNBFIA0\_LacuJugWx8k/pub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTw9LRkRi9l_8xgSdfPbAiFcohVepQ_z5DRxS8i1l_b_KoJrJ7DndThFtMEzCNBFIA0_LacuJugWx8k/pub) (if you're building your own, make sure everything it's entirely left-to-right readable. That's how the AI screeners parse your resume, so if you have columns or fancy formatting you are once again cooked).
5. **Do NOT use AI** to write your resume or cover letters. Everyone else is, the AI screeners can tell, and it doesn't help you stand out.
6. If the job portal accepts a cover letter, send one. Doesn't need to be recreated from scratch every time, but same customization principles from the resumes apply.
7. Focus your hunt on the most recently posted jobs. Recruiters tend to post a job, then wait a week or so to gather a batch of candidates who are selected go on the recruiter screening. If the job is still posted on the company website, it can still be worth applying, but try to get your applications in within the first week of the posting going live. When you sit down to start applying in the morning, focus on the most recent postings first.
8. Flex your skills and act like a salesperson after you apply (as gross as it feels to sell yourself that aggressively). Hit up the hiring contact on LinkedIn, as well as the likely hiring manager, and send them an email 4 days later if you haven't received a response (use tools like RocketReach to snag some emails). Avoid 'just following up' language and instead tell them why you're excited about the position and you have some ideas to share on how to enhance their growth plans.
9. Don't just use LinkedIn. Sites like [TrueUp](https://www.trueup.io/myjobs) and [Wellfound](https://wellfound.com/) are great to get away from the masses. Regardless of where you find the job, make sure to apply through the company website if you can.
10. Practice your answers to all the typical interview questions until they shine. I used the Amazon Loop questions to prep all mine and found they covered 99% of all questions asked by any other organization, and made me sound confident. A great prep video for that here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exgYMdo8Vdk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exgYMdo8Vdk)
11. Send a personalized thank you notes and LinkedIn connection **immediately** after every single conversation you have with a company.
12. If you're playing the long game and desperately want to work at a FAANG or similar, start hitting up people in your desired role on LinkedIn and ask them for coffee. Learn how they got in, what it takes to be successful, and build your network that way. Exactly like tech sales, long-term success comes from relationship building and being top-of-mind for someone when an opening or a need pops up. 

And at the very least, remind yourself of this to stay positive: it's an **intensely competitive** job market out there, and there are likely thousands of people applying for some of these jobs. Just because you're not in the 99.99% of people getting offers, doesn't mean you aren't a wonderful & valuable person. Go for walks when you need a break. Call your mom. Stretch and practice some breathing (seriously, [30 seconds of mindful breathing](https://share.google/aimode/Ezx6jRUM2h5PJGS1P) can make a huge mood shift after a trying experience).

It is going to suck. I had a ton of dark, frustrating days during my hunt. But if you can get up the next day, be a goldfish and put yesterday behind you, and get back at it, you'll land something eventually.

Sending you all plenty of positive waves & good luck heading into the holidays!",0,1766076842.0,torontoJobs,0,0.5,False

I get up around 8am and have my coffee right away. This metric is telling me I can have caffeine from 10am - 4pm. If I did that, I would have a hard time sleeping at night. It also tells me I should go to sleep at around midnight and sleep for 7 hours. That is craziness. I've read its best to try to keep to a consistent sleep schedule so I usually sleep from 10-10:30pm to 7-7:30am. I feel great with 9 hours.

Where I struggle is when I have to do a daunting and/or boring task that requires my full attention and cognition (e.g. job hunting!). I've already broken it down into subtasks, but for the most part there is no clear order they have to be done (i.e. check this job board, email that acquaintance) so choosing one subtask and getting started is still my biggest challenge.

I need silence to focus, so I can't even use instrumental background music. Aside from something like a specialty coffee/drink (which is fine sometimes but not something I want to do daily) or changing up my location (also not feasible daily), I can't figure out what pleasurable thing to include. 

I can't do something else first to get a ""quick hit"" because that activity ends up turning into hours. I already carve out time for relaxation and fun, so it's not that I don't get any.

Hi everyone, I wanted to make a short guide for this trophy since there aren't many out there. I had to replay it three times because I was always missing one that hadn't been marked in any guide...

I'm posting my latest playthrough day by day, but remember that some news may vary, such as some NPCs who come knocking on your door may appear earlier or later than others. Start feeding them on the third day every two days to maximize your food supplies. Always keep the temperature above 5 degrees Celsius or they'll get sick more easily. If they need to be cured, feed them right away and let them sleep. (If it's Malik, remember to listen to the broadcast every day. Below I'll tell you when he intercepted the broadcast, but like everything else, it could vary, so make sure the icon to listen to the news is no longer there before closing the day.)

Last thing before the guide: apparently, if you lie to Malik, you won't transmit the correct news, so make sure you always tell him the truth. (I'll remind you every night you can choose)

TROPHY!!

If the trophy doesn't unlock immediately, exit and re-enter the game and do it again on day 29. On my third try, it finally showed up!!

I hope this guide helps someone. I really wish I'd found it myself just to check if I was doing everything right, but no one ever noticed in the guides that said those damn fires were missing, and that if you send the bombing log, you'll never receive it again.

Saving to the cloud or a USB stick is mostly to avoid getting stuck with resources and accidentally dying and having to start over. If you need food, there's always some at the warehouse, as long as you can elude all those guards, only remember to go before telling about the bombing (broadcast 14) 😊",2,1766076422.0,ThisWarofMine,0,0.76,False

This is still a WIP, but I'm writing it faster than I expected, so I wanted to get a pulse on things before I got too far ahead of myself. Thanks in advance! 

Trigger warning for animal abuse.

\---

I’m writing to you because you are particularly interested in \[personalization\]. GODCAT is an adult speculative standalone complete at 80,000 words, where *Someone You Can Build a Nest In* meets *House of the Beast* with the grotesque ascension to godhood from the survival horror game, *Fear and Hunger*.

Marsh, a black shorthair cat, is drowned by her abusive owner in a puddle in a suburban front lawn. She is reborn as a human-shaped godling in limbo, but if she ascends to godhood, she can rejoin her abuser’s world and kill him herself. 

The many existing gods have little room for peers, so they only permit one godling out of every hundred to ascend. To prove herself worthy, Marsh and ninety-nine others are funneled into distorted landscapes within limbo that lazily mimic locations on earth. Humans wander here, and winning their worship is how godlings gain power. Nothing is outlawed. Fear and violence are all Marsh remembers from her mortal life, and she leverages them with clinical precision. But her encounter with a timid, self-sabotaging, selfless godling rocks Marsh’s core.

Against her own better judgment, she commits to protecting this pacifistic godling, and through her learns that there’s more to earth than freezing rainfalls, slow starvation, and aching suffocation. But Marsh knows that every minute spent with her is a mistake, because whoever doesn’t ascend dissolves to nothingness. And Marsh must win.

Per your guidelines \[end housekeeping\].

\---

I was three months old when my owner drowned me.

I think. It’s what the godservant explains to me. That I, a juvenile black shorthair cat, died of asphyxiation by drowning at 2:53A.M on Sunday, May 31^(st), in Poppyfield, Michigan, in a puddle formed in my owner’s front lawn by a recent flash flood.

But it’s not what I remember. I remember shaking, thrashing, screaming for the hands forcing me down to stop until the muddy water flooding into my lungs bought him my silence. That I had no strength anyway, a sack of bones in fur and some cracked keratin for nails grazing hairy, damp skin. That I was going to die, and that as my life slipped from me, so too did my pain.

Until I woke up again. I lay on the lawn once more, my neck still raw, though now the sun tries to placate it, its declarative beams making the dew on the grass glisten and the house’s peeling white paint pop.

Except there is no peeling. As new as an office shirt before morning coffee. And the house itself towers an extra story. A dog barks from somewhere within. He has no dogs.

I push off the grass but the blades prickle me. I assess my arms—flesh. Pinkish hands, like the very ones that killed me. 

I jolt. My spine doesn’t flex the way I remember.

“Do you want to become a god?”

I whirl, but fall over. My torso is shaped wrong. The dog barks louder.

“Do you want to become a god?” The voice asks again. A kind one, I decide, because it does not speak like him, even though it speaks like nothing at all.

I search for the source as wet black strands fall over my face.

backstory- I am 32f. I have a 4yo, 18month old, and I'm 26 weeks pregnant. I'm lucky that I work just weekends. I have the kids Sunday night-friday at like 1pm. My ex has them the rest. My fiance is the father of the baby.  He works basically monday-thursday 9am-11pm and 9-3 Friday and Saturday and Sunday night 2-11. So he's really not around much at all. My 4 year old is in morning preschool that I take her to and from 9:10-11:45 M-F

I am struggling to do all the housework on top of the cooking and caring for the kids. My apartment is set up super stupid where if I'm in the kitchen I can't see the living room. My 18 month old is a very big climber and finds a way to be dangerous in any situation lmao. So I feel glued to the living room while she is awake. I barely can leave to pee I feel like. I do what I can when she naps which is only an hour or two and also when I cook dinner for the evening. If I do anything cleaning up wise in the kitchen after they go to bed the 18 month old is next to the kitchen and wakes up. I'm so exhausted by then I usually fall asleep anyways. I do try to get up before the kids and it really takes me that hour to have my coffee and get mentally prepared for the day..

I need to find better ways of doing things because I'm honestly just worn out all the time and barely surviving. I always have plans to get stuff done for the day and have trouble getting them all done.

My fiance is also frustrated because the little time that he is around I'm constantly asking him for help with things or having him run errands because it's incredibly hard for me to run errands with both kids. I basically have a breakdown anytime we have to run errands. I know it's not fair to rely on him so much for things I should be doing myself. He's not even here to contribute to the mess. Plus the kids aren't his responsibility because they aren't his. Not to mention theoretically the only thing I do for him is his laundry but he helps with switching it and stuff because I struggle doing it by myself because it's downstairs away from our apartment.

I need hope. 

I'm just feeling very tired and glum, I guess? It's like I've been burning the candle at both ends nonstop for the last 18+ months, and I've finally hit my limit. Something about the holidays... Feeling all this stress during my favorite time of the year, after everything, you know? Like I had hoped for some security and peace by now, and I'm just losing sight of there being a light at the end of the tunnel. And what sucks is I WANT to be happy. I still get giddy over Christmas sprinkles, I just feel so much gratitude for the times I'm able to get my toddler out in the stroller on a beautiful day. I'm thankful we've made it this far, but I'm just so damn tired in every sense.

Some backstory: my daughter (now 11) was diagnosed with schizophrenia and autism, which experience has had its own amount of stress and trauma between handling her daily episodes and finding the right care. As we finally felt hope with finding support, she was abused at a children's hospital during a 3-week stay. I had her removed once a social worker became involved and supported our decision. Since then, she has mentally and emotionally regressed so far, and we have her PTSD diagnosis as a new struggle to balance. 

Her younger brothers have their own trauma from being around her episodes before finding the right balance of meds. She still struggles, but we feel she can at least remain safely at home. My middle son is nonverbal autistic and has his own needs, but they feel ""easy"" in comparison most days. The toddler is your typical wrecking ball of a toddler, and he's brought a lot of joy into my life. When I was pregnant with him, I had actually considered putting him up for adoption because my daughter's issues were so severe at the time. I'm grateful to have at least made it here. 

Throughout this past year or so, I have undergone my own health issues: a breast cancer scare, two unexpected pregnancies (and violently painful miscarriages) WHILE on birth control both times. I had a D&C under anesthesia and another without. A tooth abscess that led to hospitalization because it traveled to my neck and throat. 

On top of it all, my husband was laid off twice since my youngest was born as part of mass layoffs at companies. The severance was minimal, and the last one came at a time we had exhausted all of our savings to meet our daughter's needs for intensive in-home therapy, medications, and psychiatric care. We have nothing left. I know we will make it through the end of December after using what we had for her medications, but January is up in the air. Even our food stamps didn't arrive in full, so we are doing everything we can to get by while ""keeping the magic,"" especially for my daughter as she struggles mentally and emotionally. 

While I have been working my same part-time flexible job from home since I was pregnant with my daughter, I was also laid off this season after my boss decided to retire. 

AND THEN, her cats died. Both of them. She has no idea, and I can't bring myself to tell her this close to Christmas. She very much still depends on her belief of Santa and his elves for magic to help her through ""bad brain"" as she calls it. I'm not going to let her think for a moment that Santa thought she deserves this, you know what I mean? I'm grasping at straws to think of ways to tell her after the new year without it resulting in psychosis. I'm not exaggerating. 

All I want in life is to experience some sense of calm and security. Some peace. Hell, even some time to watch a cozy Christmas movie, bake some cookies, and paint my nails a festive red. Get out for a coffee or a run alone for the first time in two years. To sit down at night and enjoy time to quietly soak it all in. Not to live a fancy life, but to sit down without this barrage of anxiety and fear as I try to find ways to map out our next steps at every turn. 

Anyway, if you're still reading, thank you for listening. Please please PLEASE be kind. I know this all is so ridiculous, and I am aware of how much it feels like I'm failing my kids. But please know I advocate for them every single day, and I always put them first no matter what. I just want to hear from some people who have been through this - please just tell me it gets better. That it's possible to look back a year from now and really see things finally turn around. ",1,1766075727.0,Mommit,0,0.67,False
1ppvahn,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ppvahn/help_deciding_which_grinder_to_keep/,Help deciding which grinder to keep,"I recently picked up a Mazzer Philos. I also have a Eureka Mignon Turbo and a Baratza Encore. I had been using the Eureka for espresso and the Baratza for drip and cold brew. 

Now that I have the Mazzer, I really don't need to keep both of the other two. But I can't decide which one to keep. 

* I like the Eureka for the build quality and the larger burrs. But I hate stepless grinders, so I'd get one of those large dial mods if I kept it. I also have not tried to see if it will go coarse enough for cold brew. 
* I like the simplicity of the Baratza. It's been plenty sufficient for my drip coffee and cold brew.
* Or is the Mazzer suitable for everything to where I could get rid of both? Regardless, I'd probably like to keep one of the others to have a non-single dose grinder. 

Not sure if it matters, but I currently have GCP for espresso but have a Linea Mini ordered. Moccamaster for drip.

1ppv7y1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ppv7y1,River & Stone - Diancha,"River & Stone, being one of the few matcha mills in the US, has recently decided to revisit Dian Cha.

Me, being someone continuously falling back into the tea world and also exploring my own Asian heritage, felt the need to pick some up and try it.

That said, I am no expert of dian cha and plan on searching out some in-person tea lessons about this.

However, with what I have learned so far, compared to other teas I have personally powdered and tried, dian cha is definitely something special. Especially if you are trying to achieve the ""fluffy as snow"" froth, which is much more frothy than typical matcha microfoam. It takes a little bit more time, patience, and technique.

I'm not going to dive into the history of dian cha here. That is something for the experts and more knowledgable tea enthusiasts.



***Method usucha: 3g diancha, 80ml water (10ml room temp to make paste***, ***35ml at 70C, last add of 35ml at 70C)***

***Method latte: 3g diancha, 40ml water (8ml room temp to paste, 32ml at 70C), 120ml of Minor Figures Barista Oat Milk steamed and frothed, 10g of honey.***  


***Overall Impression of Process:***

Looking back at diancha, you are to froth it so it becomes as fluffy as snow. Seems doing 3 pours of water is essential for this. I found this to actually be more... soothing and meditative than making matcha. Perhaps it's because of the amount of time and focus needed. Being someone who does not meditate at all, this might be one of the few ways I may ever get to sort of taste that.



***Color:***

This white tea powder is still a bit more green tinged. Not that white tea is pure white anyway. But, Simon did note that they used a greener white tea for this diancha.

  
***Fragrance:***

This was highly fragrant when I opened the tin. Floral. Citrusy. Bright. Complete opposite of matcha's earthy, nutty, and vegetal notes with some floral. Definitely different than any of the white teas I hand on hand. Grinding/milling does bring out other notes, it seems.

  
***Swipe:***

This was silky, and my own swipe isn't perfect. Not gritty at all.

  
***Tasting Notes:***

As usucha, all the fragrance notes are more pronounced. Bright, floral, citrusy... with sharpness, high astringency, with a lingering mid-bitterness and soap (to me) aftertaste. A hint of late spring, dry grass also, perhaps. Paired with dates, the bitterness and astringency become a bit subdued, and everything seems to play well on the tongue with the bright notes still standing out.

Now, as a latte? All the notes softened yet also became more nuanced. Florals were notably rose notes. Citrus was more like a clementine citrus. Bitterness disappeared. Astringency was mild. This transformation made me want to come up with all different recipes of tea lattes. But not ones that are heavy on jams and syrups. Things that would complement these notes. I think this is also a wonderful alternative for those who dislike the earthiness of matcha but also might not be wanting a coffee flavor. This is that distinct. Not as heavy as an earl grey but within that floral realm.

  
***Final thoughts:***

The flavor difference in this diancha vs this other white tea I'm currently drinking (Hakusei from Ikkyu) are vastly different. I would happily drink this diancha as a latte in the morning with perhaps a spritz of cherry blossom over it come the springtime. Hakusei in the evening for me is still comforting, buttery, sweet, umami.

This diancha is one that I would keep in my rotation, but I would love to taste it made with other white teas. I will see if Simon could tell me what cultivar he used.",12,1766075522.0,tea,2,1.0,False

I’m looking to chat with expats aged 25–45 through a short, informal interview.

First of all: it’s free. Yes coffee shops etc can be cutter, but this is literally a free 3rd space outside of home/work and that’s very enjoyable.

I find that there is quite a lot of seating and can always find a space to study, plus they all have plugs which is nice and it’s quite spacious (especially love the sittings on the higher floors with the windows).

It’s not too cold or too warm in there and it’s quite calm so nice for studying.

The WiFi isn’t the best but it’s sufficient for my use.

Book wise I mostly borrow fiction and I think the selection isn’t bad! It lacks a bit of more recent books that just came out, but also forces me to find books that aren’t all over booktok etc which is nice! I just wish they had a bit more mangas/graphic novels available.

I’ve been using expense trackers for years, but I always had the same problems:  
Typing every transaction manually is annoying, receipt scanners misread items, and most apps feel bloated or confusing.

So I built my own app — **Smart Expense** — and I’d love honest feedback from you all.

**What makes it different**

* **AI-powered scanning**: Take a picture of any receipt, and the app extracts every item, amount, and category automatically. No manual editing needed.
* **Voice-to-expense**: You can literally say: *“Starbucks coffee 18 AED”* and it adds it instantly.
* **Super clean UI**: Minimal, simple, and fast—no ads, no popups.
* **Smart insights**: The app highlights where your money is going and gives suggestions on how to improve spending habits.
* **PDF & CSV export**: One tap to download your full monthly report.

**Why I’m posting**

I built this app as a solo developer, and I’m trying to make it genuinely useful—not just another boring budget app. I’d love:

* Feature suggestions
* UI/UX feedback
* Ideas to make the AI smarter

1ppv0mh,https://i.redd.it/3nl524gunz7g1.jpeg,Etiópia torrado no Brasil - Kodama Coffee Lab (PoA),"Neste ano tivemos cafés gringos torrados no Brasil por torrefações como Astral, Hyuga e Garagem do Café.

Entra para a lista esse ótimo grão etíope, torrado pela torrefação **Kodama Coffee Lab** (Porto Alegre).

A novidade fica ainda melhor, pois o processamento desse café é *lavado* e ele realmente foi tratado com muito carinho, entregando todo o potencial de uma boa *torra clara*.

Inclusive, a Kodama fez algo que eu nunca havia visto: a curva de torra desse grão (e dos demais que eles oferecem) está à disposição do público (QR code na imagem).

**Sobre a degustação:**

* O **sensorial** é muito agradável e faz jus à fama dos etíopes. Não é o café com sensorial ultra intenso e complexo, mas com certeza me deixou bastante feliz.
* No **aroma**, a torrefação anuncia mirtilo, mas eu também sinto muito limão (quando esfria).
* No **sabor**, a torrefação anuncia romã e melancia, que concordo (embora não sejam tão óbvios e claros), mas, novamente, sinto limão também no sabor.
* As **sensações** também são excelentes. A torra clara não sacrificou corpo e dulçor, que estão presentes. Mas a torra clara destacou a acidez, de forma muito integrada e harmônica, entregando uma das experiências mais interessantes do third wave coffee: suculência / juicyness.

**Sobre o preço:**  
\- Obviamente não é um café barato (R$180,00 pelo pacote de 250g). Mas foi muito mais barato, e mais interessante e prazeroso de tomar, que o café brasileiro mais caro que comprei esse ano (Figo do Pato Rei, que também foi um puta cafezão - e tem review que fiz dele aqui no sub: [veja aqui](https://www.reddit.com/r/CafeEspecialBR/comments/1nkalwi/cafez%C3%A3o_do_dia_figo_6o_colocado_no_coe_2024/)).  
\- E se você pensa que em cafeterias pagamos R$15-25 por cafés muito esquecíveis, o preço desse etíope torrado no Brasil facilmente se justifica: usando doses de 15g, esse pacote te garante pelo menos 16 xícaras ao custo unitário de apenas R$11,00.   
  
Fala sério né? NO BRAINER! Pra quem nunca provou cafés gringos, essa é uma ótima chance. Tomei 80g desse pacote e irei congelar o restante em doses de 13g. Quero fazer essa belezinha durar 😍   
  
*\*Aproveito pra deixar uma recomendação pra torrefação: que tal oferecer pacotes de 100g ou 125g, além da opção padrão de 250g? Como é um café mais caro, essa seria uma boa forma de facilitar a acessibilidade.*
