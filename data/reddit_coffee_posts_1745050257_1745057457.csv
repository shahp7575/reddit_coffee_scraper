Okay so, me and my best friend have been friends since primary school, I have had a crush on her dad basically forever. He was a single parent to her, and the crush started when I was around 12, and by the time I was like 16ish i was infatuated with him, I was always asking my friend about him and she would get kind of annoyed by it, but she knew i was into him. She thought it was gross, understandably. As we grew up I naturally saw him less and less, but would still see him occasionally at family events, big parties and stuff, and god every time i saw him I felt just like I did when I was a teenager.

Anyway, recently following a breakup my best friend has moved back home with her dad, so I've been seeing him a lot more often when I'm there to hang out with her, or pick her up to take her out, etc. And god the feelings are still there, and so strong. A couple of days ago I went to pick her up, and she wasn't ready yet, she had to shower and get dressed and do her makeup, so I hung out with her dad for a while. He made me a coffee, we chatted, and holy shit was I flustered as fuck. I swear he was into me too, maybe I'm delusional, but I really think he was flirting with me. Just the way he looked at me, gently touched me on the shoulder. The smiles he gave me, I was melting on the floor. But maybe I'm reading too much into it bc I want him so bad???

But, I think I need to make a move. I'm honestly falling for him hard. I've always been into him, and I feel like he  is genuinely the one for me. I am just worried about how my friend is going to take it, like is it an asshole move to date your friends dad? Are there rules about this? IS THIS OKAY???? IDK!!! I just want him so bad.

1k2szei,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1k2szei/mourning_cafe/,Mourning Cafe,"In the quiet town of Craven Hollow, nestled between misty woods and forgotten paths, stood an unassuming little caf√© called ""Mourning Brews."" Its charming facade, adorned with fading paint and ivy-clad walls, whispered secrets of a grim past. The locals seldom spoke of it, often lowering their voices and averting their eyes when it was mentioned. Yet, the legend drew curious visitors like moths to a flame.

Rayu had always been fascinated by tales that lingered in shadows. As an aspiring paranormal investigator, he traveled the world seeking the uncanny and the unexplained. When Rayu heard about the haunted caf√© with a history steeped in mystery, he knew he had to visit.

The story behind Mourning Brews was chilling. Decades ago, it had been the site of sinister happenings. People vanished without a trace, and strange occurrences were attributed to the caf√© itself. Some claimed the espresso machines would turn on by themselves and pour cups of thick, black liquid at midnight; others heard whispers when no one was around.

Rayu arrived on a crisp autumn evening, the air thick with the scent of fallen leaves and something unnameable. As he stepped into the caf√©, a bell above the door chimed softly, and the warm light inside contrasted with the gloom outside. The caf√©, though empty, felt alive, as though every piece of furniture listened intently.

He set up his equipment‚Äîa digital recorder, infrared camera, and a thermal scanner. As he settled into a corner booth with a cappuccino, a sense of unease pricked at his skin. The air was heavy, a palpable presence.

Hours passed with nothing extraordinary, until the clock struck midnight. The temperature plummeted, and the lights flickered ominously. Rayu‚Äôs heart pounded like a drum. He gripped his camera, aiming it around the room.

In the lens, a faint, shimmering form materialized. A woman, translucent and sorrowful, stood behind the counter. Her eyes were pools of darkness, filled with unvoiced lament. Rayu‚Äôs breath caught as he realized he was no longer alone.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù he whispered, his voice barely audible over the static hum of his equipment.

The specter opened her mouth to speak, and a soft, melodic whisper filled the room. ‚ÄúI am Elyse‚Ä¶ trapped by the choices I made, by the secrets that bind me.‚Äù

Rayu listened intently, capturing every word. Elyse was the owner of the caf√© during its darkest days. She had witnessed atrocities she could not prevent, bound by fear and an unbreakable silence. The mournful brew wasn‚Äôt just coffee; it was a potion of despair, a concoction that masked her sorrow.

A tear slipped from her ghostly eyes. ‚ÄúHelp me find peace, so that the caf√© may be free from its chains.‚Äù

Rayu, moved by her plight, promised to uncover the truth. The night wore on as Rayu delved deeper, guided by Elyse‚Äôs spectral presence. He uncovered hidden diaries buried beneath loose floorboards, revealing secrets of greed, betrayal, and redemption. The caf√© had been a meeting ground for illicit affairs, and Elyse had been the unfortunate custodian of their cursed legacy.

With dawn‚Äôs arrival, Elyse‚Äôs figure slowly faded, her form lightening as if relieved of a heavy burden. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she breathed, her voice like the gentle rustle of leaves.

Rayu watched as the caf√© seemed to exhale, the oppressive atmosphere lifting. The legend of Mourning Brews was rewritten that day, from a place of horror to one of healing. The caf√©, no longer haunted, became a beacon for those seeking solace and remembrance.

Rayu departed, his heart full, his story complete. Craven Hollow‚Äôs mystery had been unraveled, and a soul had found tranquility at last.",1,1745057318.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

Hope it gives you strength and courage, especially the Pinays here, and those who are approaching the dreaded 13w safe timeline for MA. 

Apr 12 Sat. I used the s2c chat bot on their website and answered their questions. I got FPOP's contact number. It's the PH's biggest and oldest nongov family planning org. I sent a text message.

Apr 12 Sun. Someone replied saying FPOP doesn't provide MA pills, but she knows a legit source. She asked for a transv through the same number but on WhatsApp. I sent it, she calculated it, said I need three Miso doses, asked for my shipping information and gave me the total which is 3,100 + 200 JRS same-day shipping fee (North Luzon). She also gave me instructions on taking them.

Apr 14 Tue. Parcel got sent and shipped out.

Apr 15 Wed. Parcel arrived.

Apr 16 Thu. I took Mife at 3:00 PM

Apr 17 Fri. I have to meet my husband and my son (6yo) so I couldn't wait until 3:00 PM. I promised my son a date and I don't want to disappoint him. I don't suggest going earlier than 24-48 hours for the Miso unless needed. Always be on the safe side as much as possible. 

11:30 PM. I took Paracetamol.
12:30 PM. I took the first dose, four Miso under the tongue. I watched a Netflix movie to forget the time.
12:45 PM. Cramps on my lower pelvis started. 2/10 pain. Had LBM and spotting.

1:00 PM. I swallowed the remaining pills. I ate Skyflakes Flaxseed to get rid of the taste. Had LBM again with some slimy blood. Cramping in the same spot with the same intensity.

1:30 PM. Another LBM. Small strings of blood but not much. When I went back to bed, the pain started to crawl from the lower pelvis to the upper, the left, the right, but the pain remains at 2/10.

2:00 PM. Pain was 4/10. Another urge for LBM. I went to the bathroom and sat on the toilet for my LBM. I washed and sat on the floor to pee (PH thing maybe) and get rid of more blood before I changed into a new pad. I just let the blood flow on the floor as I squat. The old diaper is still on me, on my knees. When I stood up, something came out of me with force/pressure. I couldn't help but utter ""Uuuhhh!"" because of the very sudden coming out of that thing. When I looked at my diaper, it was the little one. Pain came back to 2/10. If you're as far as me, be mentally and emotionally prepared for what you could see. Google Images helped me a lot on what to expect. 

2:25 PM. Still in the bathroom. Blood started flowing nonstop on me after the little one came out. I put him aside while I cleaned. I dug a hole in the yard and buried him with apologies and prayers. 

I came back to bed in a diaper and with a pee pad on me. I took some rest before I prepared for our date. 

3:30 PM. I took the second Miso dose, four tabs, and went to the bathroom to get dressed up. Cramps came up to 4/10 again. I squatted on the floor again to get rid of the blood when something meaty came out of me. I think it was the placenta. It's got veins and stuff. I finished dressing up and went out.

Period-like amount of bleeding here and there. Pain played around 2 to 3 out of 10. LBM stopped.

6:30 PM. We're back home. (Luckily) Because cramping pain came back and increased to 8/10. I couldn't move I only curled on my seat. This was also the only moment I felt the headache and dizziness. Cramping subsided and then I had the LBM urge again. Went to the bathroom and when I was about to wash (sitting on the toilet) I touched something midway out of my V. I didn't know what to do. I read mixed stuff before, some say it's okay to pull stuff, some say no. I was scared to pull so I tried to push but it didn't help. I changed to a squatting position and luckily it helped. It slid out of me, as big as a lemon. 

After this point, bleeding became like a normal period and pain came back to 2/10. I filled in only two full overnight napkins throughout the night.

Apr 19 Sat. Bleeding became like my last period days. Very light and very seldom. Got a lot less cramps as well with very low pain.

To my little one, I'm so sorry I had you at the wrong time. This decision is not just for me, but for you as well. You'll be forever in my thoughts. 

To my co-Pinays, NEVER fall for local sellers on the blue app, on the orange shopping app, etc. that says ridiculous pre-MA preparations like use primrose for two weeks along with drinking black coffee and pineapple juice, and a lot more. That's just to make them sound legit and knowledgeable. And so they can blame you for failed MA if you didn't rigorously follow them. Theeeen they will sell you another round of MA pills. I fell for one before I learned about s2c, and I already paid the full 4k because I didn't want to send my ID for their COD and partial payment methods. I received their meds the same day I received FPOP's but of course I used FPOP's. Charged to experience üòÖ",1,1745056874.0,abortion,1,1.0,False

Now he‚Äôs mad at me for being upset about it.,"I hope this title isn‚Äôt too long. I‚Äôm looking for advice‚Ä¶ Have I done something wrong here and not realised it? Is there something here I could‚Äôve done differently or better? I don‚Äôt understand how this has backfired onto me. 

So tonight me and my boyfriend are meant to be going out with a group of his old school friends. I‚Äôve met them all before, they‚Äôre all nice people and fun to hang around with. There is one girl however‚Ä¶ for the purpose of this post I‚Äôll call her Dee (24 F), I don‚Äôt dislike her, I‚Äôve just always been uncertain around her, maybe due to her really flirtatious and reckless nature and the fact that she doesn‚Äôt mind seeing other men despite having a bf too. But other than that, she‚Äôs always been nice to me. 

This morning in bed me and my bf were looking over some old photos from before I met him. School/college photos. Amongst them all there were selfies of just himself and Dee. I jokingly said ‚Äúoh there‚Äôs that one, did you have the hots for her? You‚Äôve got so many pictures with her?‚Äù. I know I technically set myself up here I just wasn‚Äôt expecting him to actually say yes, in a way? 
He laughed and said ‚Äúyeah I would‚Äôve dated her if she‚Äôd given me the chance‚Äù. He must‚Äôve quickly recognised the sad look on my face and immediately tried to make up for it by saying ‚ÄúBut I would‚Äôve dated anyone back then‚Äù.

We didn‚Äôt argue, I didn‚Äôt make a scene, I just rolled over in bed and he did the same. After about 10 mins of laying in silence I got up and went downstairs to start my day, made a coffee and sat in my usual spot in the kitchen. 

After 30 mins, he came down. Really mad. Questioning me. Accusing me of taking his ‚Äúpast out on him‚Äù, kept telling me how lonely his childhood was and that now he can‚Äôt tell me anything because I‚Äôve made him feel guilty for it. I tried to deescalate things, tried to get him to sit down, he wanted me to apologise but was just getting angrier that I wasn‚Äôt and started swearing. Eventually I apologised but told him that he was invalidating my feelings too. He refused to apologise to me, said that my feelings weren‚Äôt valid because ‚Äúof course I love you‚Äù.

Kinda just sat here now. Questioning what to do, he‚Äôs asked me to leave. I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm really the bad person here.

So yea If u had seen my previous post, I just visited the Emergency Doctor again and was told that the prednisone that I took would have had no effect on what I felt on Tuesday. So I asked him if it‚Äôs cuz of the poor lifestyle habits I was having- drinking coffee, energy drinks, sleeping late and drinking very less water last week. To which he responded that that could be the only reason he can diagnose of.

However, I‚Äôve been through military and have been put in situations where I was operating with barely an hour of sleep, very little water, barely eating anything and all but came out alive. Nothing during that time made me go through that hell of an episode on Tuesday. I walked around my university campus for straight 3 hours so that I can ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù. We even did a blood test today and it came out all right. Idk why but I feel so impacted by the incident and just can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. Even now if I‚Äôm not distracting myself with something, I go back to the same jittery feeling. I asked the doc this but he just told me to go back to health eating and sleeping habits.

How a Saving Marriage Book Can Transform Relationship Dynamics
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Unlocking New Perspectives with a Saving Marriage Book

Relationships often face challenges that can feel overwhelming. In moments of tension and misunderstanding, it‚Äôs easy for couples to drift apart rather than come together. A saving marriage book serves as a powerful tool to guide couples through these tough times. By offering practical advice, communication strategies, and emotional insights, such a book can transform the way partners interact and resolve conflicts.

When you open a saving marriage book, you‚Äôre inviting in a resource designed to help you see your relationship from a fresh angle. It‚Äôs not just about putting out fires; it‚Äôs about learning how to build a stronger foundation for long-term happiness. This kind of book encourages self-reflection and honesty, which are key ingredients for any healthy relationship.

### How These Books Foster Better Communication

One of the most common problems in troubled marriages is poor communication. Couples often find themselves stuck in cycles of blaming, misunderstanding, or silence. A saving marriage book often includes exercises that teach you and your partner to listen actively and speak with empathy. Improving communication skills can reduce arguments and increase emotional intimacy.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
When you develop better communication, everything else improves ‚Äî from how you solve problems together to how you share joys and dreams. The book may offer specific scripts or phrase suggestions that help you express yourself without triggering defensiveness in your partner. Learning these techniques creates a safe space where both of you feel heard and valued.

### Rebuilding Trust and Emotional Connection

Trust can be fragile, especially after a betrayal or a series of broken promises. Saving marriage books provide tools to rebuild trust step-by-step. They emphasize the importance of transparency, patience, and consistent effort. You might find guidance on how to apologize sincerely and make amends, which helps heal old wounds.

These books also highlight the power of emotional connection. Through daily practices like gratitude journaling or shared rituals, couples can rekindle the warmth and affection that first drew them together. Focusing on positive interactions helps rebuild the emotional bank account you share with your partner.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
### Encouraging Personal Growth Alongside Relationship Growth

One key insight found in many saving marriage books is that the health of a marriage is deeply linked to the health of each individual. When you work on your own self-awareness, emotional regulation, and stress management, you become a better partner. Sometimes, the greatest change happens within, which then naturally shifts the relationship dynamic.

Books centered on saving marriages often include exercises for personal reflection or mindfulness. They might encourage you to explore your values, past experiences, or communication style. This personal growth creates a ripple effect, making your marriage more resilient:

- You communicate more clearly and calmly.
- You become more patient with conflicts.
- You foster deeper empathy for your partner‚Äôs feelings.

### Practical Strategies to Implement Daily

What makes a saving marriage book especially valuable is its focus on actionable steps. The advice isn't just theory; it‚Äôs practical, doable actions that can be integrated into everyday life. From setting weekly date nights to practicing forgiveness, these easy-to-follow strategies help you steadily improve your relationship.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
Many books recommend creating rituals to nurture your connection. This might be a morning coffee together without distractions or a shared hobby that brings joy and teamwork. Having these routines anchors your relationship, making it a priority even when life gets busy.

### Understanding the Role of Empathy and Compassion

A saving marriage book often stresses the significance of empathy ‚Äî the ability to understand and share your partner‚Äôs feelings. When you learn to view your partner‚Äôs actions through a lens of compassion rather than judgment, conflicts become opportunities to deepen your bond instead of reasons to separate.

Developing this mindset can transform how disagreements unfold. Instead of escalating conflicts, you might pause to ask yourself, ""What is my partner really feeling?"" or ""How can I support them right now?"" This attitude fosters patience, reduces hostility, and encourages nurturing responses.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
### Making the Commitment to Long-Term Change

Reading a saving marriage book is just the start. The real transformation happens when you commit to applying what you learn consistently. Change in relationships takes time and effort, and these books remind couples that setbacks are normal and growth is an ongoing journey.

By making a joint commitment to personal and shared growth, couples can break unhelpful patterns and embrace healthier ways of being together. This renewed dedication helps marriages become not just stable, but truly thriving relationships where both partners feel loved, respected, and fulfilled.

Practical Exercises From Saving Marriage Books to Strengthen Emotional Bonds
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Daily Check-In Rituals to Build Connection

One of the core practices found in popular saving marriage books is creating a daily check-in routine. This is a simple yet powerful exercise where couples set aside a few minutes each day to share their feelings, thoughts, and experiences. This habit helps partners stay connected emotionally and prevents misunderstandings from building up over time.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
Try setting a specific time, like after dinner or before going to bed, to sit down without distractions like phones or TV. Use this time to ask open-ended questions such as, ‚ÄúHow did your day make you feel?‚Äù or ‚ÄúIs there anything on your mind that you want to share?‚Äù Listening attentively and responding with empathy strengthens the emotional bond. The daily check-in ritual promotes trust and shows that each partner‚Äôs emotions are valued.

### Gratitude Journaling as a Shared Activity

Saving marriage books often highlight gratitude as a key ingredient in emotional closeness. Couples can improve their relationship by creating gratitude journals, either individually or as a pair. This practice encourages you to focus on positive aspects of your partner and your relationship, helping to counterbalance negativity or conflict.

You might each write down three things you appreciate about your spouse daily or weekly. Sharing these entries aloud creates moments of affirmation and encouragement. This kind of exercise reminds partners of what initially brought them together and fosters a deeper appreciation for each other‚Äôs efforts.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
### Effective Communication Exercises

Miscommunication is a frequent cause of tension between couples. Many saving marriage books recommend specific exercises to enhance how partners talk and listen. One such technique is ""active listening,"" where one person shares their feelings without interruption while the other repeats back what they heard to confirm understanding.

This process can be formalized in sessions where each partner takes turns being the speaker and listener. By focusing fully on what your spouse is saying, you avoid assumptions and judgments that can lead to conflict. Practicing this regularly helps couples develop patience and empathy, key to a healthy emotional connection.

### Love Language Discovery Fun

Identifying each other‚Äôs love language is another strategy recommended in relationship repair books. The five love languages‚Äîwords of affirmation, quality time, receiving gifts, acts of service, and physical touch‚Äîdescribe how people prefer to give and receive love.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
Couples can complete love language quizzes together and discuss the results in a lighthearted way. Once you know what makes your partner feel most appreciated, you can intentionally express your love in those ways. This clear expression of care helps bridge emotional gaps and reduces feelings of neglect or misunderstanding.

### Shared Goals and Future Planning

Working towards shared goals is a bonding activity that creates a sense of partnership. Most saving marriage books encourage couples to identify common interests, dreams, and values, and set achievable goals together.

- Plan a weekly or monthly ‚Äúgoal-setting date‚Äù where you discuss your visions for the future.
- Break down big goals, like improving finances or planning family trips, into smaller, actionable steps.
- Celebrate progress regularly to build momentum and positive reinforcement.

These exercises help couples feel united in purpose and create a positive momentum in the relationship. Knowing you‚Äôre teammates working towards mutual happiness enhances your emotional connection.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
### Conflict Resolution Practice

Even the strongest couples face disagreements, but how you handle conflict can make or break your emotional bond. Many saving marriage books introduce structured conflict resolution strategies to help couples manage arguments productively.

One effective exercise involves setting ground rules for conflict:

- No yelling or name-calling.
- Focus on ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements to express feelings, not accusations (‚ÄúI feel hurt when‚Ä¶‚Äù).
- Take breaks if emotions run too high and agree to resume calm discussions later.

Practicing these guidelines during disagreements teaches respectful communication. It helps partners feel safe and heard instead of attacked, deepening the emotional bond even during tough times.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
### Physical Connection Activities

Saving marriage books frequently emphasize physical closeness to reinforce intimacy and emotional bonds. Simple activities like holding hands, hugging, or spending time cuddling on the couch release oxytocin, the ‚Äúbonding hormone.‚Äù

Scheduling regular date nights or couple‚Äôs massages can also foster physical connection. Moving together through activities like dance classes or walks in nature increases shared experiences and reduces stress.

Remember, the goal isn‚Äôt just physical intimacy but emotional availability through touch, which builds trust and comfort between you both.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
Putting these practical exercises from saving marriage books into action can do wonders for nurturing and strengthening your emotional bond. Regular communication, gratitude, understanding love languages, goal sharing, respectful conflict resolution, and physical connection create a solid foundation to revitalize your marriage. With deliberate effort and genuine care, you can transform challenges into opportunities for deeper love and connection.

### Conclusion

A saving marriage book offers more than just advice; it provides a roadmap to transform your relationship dynamics in meaningful ways. By guiding you through common challenges and offering proven strategies, these books help couples rebuild trust, improve communication, and deepen their emotional connection. When you apply the lessons consistently, you begin to see changes not only in how you interact but also in how you understand each other on a deeper level.

The practical exercises included in many saving marriage books play a vital role in strengthening your emotional bonds. These activities encourage honest dialogue, shared vulnerability, and active listening‚Äîall crucial ingredients for a lasting marriage. By making time for these exercises, you and your partner can reconnect, resolve conflicts more effectively, and create new, positive patterns together.

If you're feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or unsure about the future of your relationship, a saving marriage book might be the supportive tool you need. It encourages you to take positive steps forward and offers actionable solutions that fit your unique situation. Remember, saving a marriage isn‚Äôt about perfection but about growth and commitment. With patience, effort, and the right guidance, your marriage can become a source of joy and strength for both you and your partner.

I M21 and my gf F20 have been together since we were 16, but met when we were 15. We have a great relationship tbh, we have our ups and downs but communicate very well. However there's always been one issue.. travel. 

Now for some backstory, I grew up with very little money, as did she. However I'm very lucky that my parents (a rock climber and mtbr) would take me traveling with them all over the country in the back of their old car as a kid. We would go rock climbing, mountain biking with old bikes my dad put together with old parts he found working at a bike shop, hiking, sneak into hotels to use the pool/showers etc. They would find ways to travel for incredibly cheap and I've grown up that way. My gfs parents on the other hand were very much homebodies and spent there money on streaming subscriptions and coffee (nothing wrong with that tho) and she never left her hometown except on one or two occasions and it was a bad experience as she tells me :( .

Now these last 4.5 years with her have been amazing, however it's always been a dream of mine to travel in a van/car around the country. Since I've been a little kid I've wanted too and I've saved up money to do that. I was going to travel my gap year but gave it up so we could be together. However now im almost done with my second year of college and I'm about to buy a vehicle i can sleep in and have enough money to dirtbag travel this summer. I'm not sure I'm willing to give this summer up and I feel selfish about it. I've tried to get her to travel with me on very short trips before, and I plan accommodations for her to be more comfterable like plenty of extra clothes,  hotel rooms so she can have a nice bed/shower and place to do her makeup, resteraunts and shopping, local attractions i know she will like etc. She never seems interested and so we end up not going, and im talking about just the next town over not even another state, but she acts like all travel is expensive and unobtainable. We seriously do not go ANYWHERE, even to go camping 30mins away. I feel like im losing myself a little bit and wonder what I should do.

I‚Äôm writing here because I‚Äôm carrying something heavy, and I don‚Äôt really know what to do with it anymore. Maybe just putting it into words will help. Maybe someone out there will recognize what I‚Äôm going through.

So here‚Äôs my story:

I was deeply in love with someone ‚Äî let‚Äôs call her P. We shared something intense, emotional, full of depth and beauty, but also of instability. Our relationship had its cracks, and eventually, we fell apart.
But we didn‚Äôt fully let go. She kept messaging me. Almost every day. She‚Äôd say she missed me, that I was on her mind, that she wasn‚Äôt feeling well. She‚Äôd send pictures of her new apartment, ask how I was, check in with tenderness. She even told me she loved me.
But here‚Äôs the thing: she also told me ‚Äî eventually ‚Äî that she‚Äôs seeing someone else. And not just casually. She‚Äôs going to meet his parents.
I‚Äôve been spiraling since.
Not because I‚Äôm angry.
But because I just don‚Äôt understand.
How can someone tell you ‚Äúyou‚Äôre in my heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúI miss you deeply,‚Äù but still choose to build a new life with someone else? Is she lost? Is she confused? Am I just the emotional cushion while she transitions?
I want to believe that she‚Äôs sincere.
I want to believe that maybe she really is torn.
That maybe she still loves me in a deep, buried way.
But I also know that actions matter more than words.
And the truth is ‚Äî she hasn‚Äôt made a move toward me. She says she‚Äôs scared. That it‚Äôs ‚Äúall weird.‚Äù She tells me she misses me ‚Äúlike crazy,‚Äù but avoids seeing me. Even a coffee is too much. So I try to accept. I try not to force. I‚Äôve said all I could, and I‚Äôve done everything I know how to do.
Now, I‚Äôm just walking.
Trying to heal.
Trying to stop holding on to something that‚Äôs maybe only alive in me.
But in my heart of hearts, I still love her.
I‚Äôm not waiting. I‚Äôm not chasing.
But I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt hope ‚Äî that something might shift, someday.
That if this love is real, it will find its way.
And if not, then maybe letting go is the only real form of love I have left.
I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.
Is she being sincere but unstable?
Or am I just holding on to a ghost dressed in sweet words?

I intended this as a ""practice"" trip for them since they havent been to Japan in over a decade, and I wanted a relaxing and chill trip for them with no overly planned itinerary. Unexpectedly, my partner's mum's medical condition took a turn. Its not terminal yet but she will not be the same and travel might not be possible anymore. Trip is in a few days and I'm just feeling stressed out because I want to give her the best final (hopefully not...) trip, I dont want regrets and things/experiences that she would miss out on just because I initially planned this with the mentality that there would be a lot more future trips to Japan.

Kamakura (2 nights)
First day will be settling in, we will hang around Ginza in the afternoon, still not sure what to eat there, then settle down in accomodation. Next day early morning I'm not sure if I should do Kamakura then Enoshima or other way round. Sunset at Enoshima sounds nice. 

Fuji (2 nights)
I hope she gets a beautiful view of Mt Fuji, I've been searching for less crowded places with beautiful view on google maps. If anyone has something in mind but dont want it to be known to many, please dm me. Booked a beautiful airbnb with fuji view so we may chill and cook at least 1 meal, maybe grocery store wagyu beef?

Ryokan (1 night)
So glad I incorporated a ryokan stay with meals included.

Tochigi (2 nights)
Accomodation is around the lower part of Tochigi. I plan to visit Ashikaga flower park for the wisteria bloom and night illumination. Next day I'm thinking if I should slot in Nikko since I heard about it but have not done any research yet. Before flying back, will visit Hitachi seaside park for flowers.

Must eat: Sushi omakase, yakiniku, sukiyaki, ramen, udon, soba, tempura, coffee, matcha, traditional japanese sweet, mochi/dango, unagi, takoyaki

Must do: Mega donki, bookoff super bazaar, 1 of those big outlet shopping with uniqlo, GU, 3coins etc, japan grocery stores, 2 or 3 shrines, sunrise/sunset, buy matcha set and premium matcha

The bakery display case is the unsung hero of any successful bakery, cafe, or pastry shop. It's not just about keeping your delectable creations fresh; it's about showcasing them in a way that entices customers and drives sales.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The ideal bakery display case combines functionality, aesthetics, and durability. It should not only preserve the quality of your baked goods but also present them in an appealing manner that captures the attention of potential customers.

**Temperature Control:** A consistent and accurate temperature is crucial for maintaining the freshness and quality of perishable items.

Modern bakery display cases are equipped with sophisticated temperature control systems. These systems typically allow for precise adjustments to maintain the ideal temperature range for various types of baked goods, usually between 36Êé≥F and 40Êé≥F for refrigerated models and slightly warmer for non-refrigerated models. Digital displays and electronic controls ensure accurate monitoring and adjustments, preventing temperature fluctuations that can compromise the freshness of your products.

**Humidity Control:** Maintaining the right humidity level prevents baked goods from drying out or becoming soggy.

Humidity control is another vital aspect of bakery display cases, especially for delicate pastries and cakes. Some high-end models feature built-in humidity control systems that automatically adjust the humidity levels within the case to prevent moisture loss or condensation. These systems often utilize a combination of cooling coils and air circulation to maintain the optimal humidity range, typically between 50% and 60%. This helps to preserve the texture, flavor, and appearance of your baked goods for longer periods.

**Lighting:** Proper lighting enhances the visual appeal of your products and draws customers' eyes.

Lighting plays a significant role in showcasing your baked goods effectively. LED lighting has become the standard for bakery display cases due to its energy efficiency, long lifespan, and ability to provide bright, even illumination. LED lights also emit minimal heat, which helps to prevent temperature fluctuations within the case. Many display cases feature adjustable lighting systems, allowing you to customize the brightness and color temperature to highlight specific products and create a visually appealing presentation.

**Shelving and Display Options:** Versatile shelving configurations allow for optimal product presentation and space utilization.

Shelving options are crucial for maximizing the display space and showcasing a variety of baked goods. Adjustable shelves, tiered displays, and rotating shelves are common features that allow you to customize the layout of your display case to suit your specific product offerings. Glass shelves provide a clean and elegant look while maximizing visibility, while wire shelves offer better air circulation for certain types of products. Some display cases also feature built-in risers or platforms to elevate certain items and create visual interest.

**Materials and Construction:** Durable and high-quality materials ensure longevity and ease of maintenance.

The materials used in the construction of a bakery display case are important for both its durability and aesthetics. Stainless steel is a popular choice for the exterior due to its resistance to corrosion and ease of cleaning. Tempered glass is used for the display windows to provide a clear view of the products while also being resistant to breakage. The internal components, such as the cooling system and insulation, should also be made from high-quality materials to ensure reliable performance and longevity.

**Accessibility and Cleaning:** Easy access for restocking and cleaning simplifies daily operations.

Accessibility and ease of cleaning are essential considerations for any bakery display case. Sliding or hinged doors provide easy access for restocking and cleaning, while removable shelves and trays simplify the cleaning process. The design of the display case should also minimize the accumulation of dirt and debris, with smooth surfaces and rounded corners that are easy to wipe down. Some models also feature automatic defrost cycles to prevent ice buildup and simplify maintenance.

 ## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality bakery display case can yield significant benefits for your business, from increased sales to improved product quality.

**Increased Sales:** An attractive and well-organized display case can entice customers to purchase more items.

A visually appealing display case can significantly impact your sales. By showcasing your baked goods in an organized and attractive manner, you can capture the attention of potential customers and entice them to make a purchase. A well-lit and properly maintained display case creates a sense of freshness and quality, which can encourage customers to try new items or indulge in a treat.

**Improved Product Quality and Freshness:** Proper temperature and humidity control preserve the quality and extend the shelf life of your baked goods.

Maintaining the optimal temperature and humidity levels is crucial for preserving the quality and freshness of your baked goods. A high-quality bakery display case can help to prevent your products from drying out, becoming stale, or spoiling prematurely. This not only reduces waste but also ensures that your customers are always receiving the freshest and most delicious products possible.

**Enhanced Brand Image:** A stylish and well-maintained display case reflects positively on your bakery's overall image.

Your bakery display case is an important element of your brand image. A stylish and well-maintained display case can create a positive impression on your customers and reinforce your commitment to quality. A clean and attractive display case can also help to differentiate your bakery from competitors and create a memorable experience for your customers.

**Reduced Waste:** Proper storage conditions minimize spoilage and reduce food waste.

By maintaining the ideal temperature and humidity levels, a high-quality bakery display case can help to extend the shelf life of your baked goods and reduce waste. This not only saves you money on ingredients but also helps to minimize your environmental impact.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions can help potential buyers make informed decisions.

**What size bakery display case do I need?**

The size of the bakery display case you need depends on the volume of products you intend to display and the available space in your bakery. Consider the number of different items you offer and the quantity of each item you want to showcase. Measure the available space carefully, taking into account any obstructions or limitations. It is generally better to err on the side of a slightly larger display case than a smaller one, as this will allow you to accommodate future growth and offer a wider variety of products.

**What type of refrigeration is best for a bakery display case?**

There are two main types of refrigeration systems used in bakery display cases: self-contained and remote. Self-contained systems have the compressor and condenser built into the display case, making them easier to install and maintain. Remote systems have the compressor and condenser located separately, typically in a back room or basement, which reduces noise and heat in the display area. The best type of refrigeration for your bakery will depend on your specific needs and preferences, as well as the layout of your space.

**How often should I clean my bakery display case?**

Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining the hygiene and appearance of your bakery display case. You should wipe down the interior and exterior surfaces daily with a mild detergent and water. Removable shelves and trays should be washed thoroughly at least once a week. It is also important to clean the condenser coils regularly to ensure efficient operation of the refrigeration system. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning and maintenance to avoid damaging the display case.

**What is the average lifespan of a bakery display case?**

The lifespan of a bakery display case can vary depending on the quality of the materials, the type of refrigeration system, and the level of maintenance. With proper care and maintenance, a high-quality bakery display case can last for 10-15 years or longer.

I follow you from France and I recognize myself in many of the testimonies. (Especially on the harm that this poison can cause)
I tried to stop I don't know how many times only to start again!
There was always a good (or bad) reason to drink and in France it is almost an Art.
In any case, it‚Äôs part of our culture.
I have a long background in the hotel and catering industry which doesn't help matters. It is indeed a professional environment where we drink a lot!
I never really considered myself an alcoholic because I never woke up with the desire to start my day with alcohol rather than with coffee...
But I started earlier and earlier in the day and until the bottle was empty, I didn't stop...
At the time I drank wine or beer...
For about 2 years it was only strong alcohol (whiskey, vodka, rum, mixed with fruit juice but still I really had a big problem that I hid from myself)
What happened?
I realized that it was because my life didn't suit me and that I had lost faith...(Big realization since March)
I prayed a lot and you may not know it but reading your personal experiences helps me immensely.
Anyway, I haven't had a single drink since April 3!
I went food shopping yesterday and when I saw a bottle of vodka, I really wanted to vomit... I assure you that it's a profound change in me because 16 days ago I would have bought this bottle and emptied it during the day!!!
In just 16 days, my mind is so much clearer, my skin is more beautiful, I have deflated too (my jeans are less tight), no more night sweats, the desire to stay in bed, anyway I sometimes couldn't stand up for 24/48 hours)
And above all, already 130‚Ç¨ in savings in just 16 days!
 So you who read this, I tell you, if I can do it, Everyone can do it!
The main thing is to keep trying even if you relapse.
I think this time it's the right one because the simple sight of a bottle disgusts me!!!

Thank you for existing!

Eventually, she told me (according to her) that she had autism.

Most of our conversations felt pretty one-sided. We once planned to meet at the park, but she canceled last minute, saying she had hurt her leg. After she told me about her autism, she often claimed I was treating her differently.

She opened up about her past, telling me her ex had left her, and that another guy she had been seeing replaced her not long after. I remember one day I got mugged and nearly lost her number ‚Äî oddly enough, she barely reacted and told me she wouldn‚Äôt text unless I messaged first.

She used to talk about her cats all the time, and she mentioned her nephews were also autistic. I recall she once got really mad when her cousin brought up the fact she used to drink with her ex.

At one point, I invited her to go to the movies, since she was always saying we never went out. She refused at first, saying she was too shy, but after I insisted, she agreed. The very next day, she asked me: ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be better if we were just friends?‚Äù

Still, we ended up going to the movies. We met there, bought some candy, kissed during the film, and later spent the afternoon cuddling. She never let me check her phone, always stayed distant, and only shared her Instagram with me after we broke up.

Another time, we went to the mall. She gave me some chocolate, and we ended up at a motel. Once there, she said she was feeling too embarrassed and asked to keep the lights off. I said it was fine, but her mood shifted completely and she became defensive.

Before that, we had spent an afternoon kissing at the park, and when it was time for her to leave, I offered to walk her home. It always felt like she was avoiding introducing me to her family. I walked her back and left.

On another occasion, her sister dropped her off at my place. I mentioned we didn‚Äôt go out much because she was always making excuses, and she got really mad at me for saying that.

One day, we were gaming together, and I criticized the game ‚Äî she got upset and stopped playing. Later, she brought me chocolate, we hung out for a while, and soon after she brought up the idea of breaking up.

She once invited me to a party, but later said she wasn‚Äôt going anymore, only to change her mind at the last minute. I got annoyed and asked if she even wanted me to go with her. I told her I‚Äôd go, and asked if I could arrive a bit earlier, but she made it clear I should only show up at 6 PM.

I went earlier anyway. Her sister saw me on the street and invited me upstairs. Later we went to her friend‚Äôs party, and she introduced me as her boyfriend. Out of nowhere, she looked at me and said, ‚ÄúShould we download an app to find a hot girl for you?‚Äù

After the party, we went back to her place. She asked me to stay the night, but I ended up leaving.

After all these situations, I called her and ended things. She started crying and blocked me. Later, she told me I had pushed her into therapy and that I had stolen her happiness.

Even so, she texted me later, saying she missed me more than she expected. We started talking again. One day, while we were still talking, I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she claimed she was actually looking for her friend‚Äôs ex.

In the end, I told her I loved her. She said the feeling would pass and told me she had gone somewhere and wished I was there. Later, she called and invited me to her mother‚Äôs birthday party, but I didn‚Äôt go. Her mother even called me, asking if I loved her. Later, her mom invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again, and she told me her father was extremely mad at me. I felt awful and ended up venting about it online. She found out, confronted me, and said I had lied to and used her ‚Äî that her behavior was all because of her insecurities and autism ‚Äî and that she had prayed for me every single day. After that, she blocked me and disappeared.

**How can I maximize the burn time and scent throw of my Bao Bao candle?**

To maximize the burn time and scent throw of your Bao Bao candle, it's essential to trim the wick to about ÂΩï inch before each use. This helps prevent smoking and ensures a clean, even burn.

1k2s66x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1k2s66x/my_friend_called_me_pedophile_what_should_i_do/,My friend called me pedophile. What should I do ?,"Last time I posted on Reddit, I received some wonderful advice, and I even suggested my friend do the same. She‚Äôs using my throwaway account now.

I (29F) moved into my current apartment two years ago. We have an elderly neighbor (in her late 70s) who mostly keeps to herself. She gets her groceries and medicines delivered every week, but the newspaper delivery boy only drops the paper on the ground floor. Before I moved in, she used to pay some neighborhood kids to bring it up to her, but they moved away shortly after I arrived. So, I started bringing her the paper every day. I usually ring the bell and leave it at her door, but when the door is already open, we sometimes have a little chat. She often insists I come in for coffee and always thanks me warmly.

I noticed her apartment is filled with pictures of her grandson‚Äîprobably more than 20. To be honest, I thought he was the cutest baby I‚Äôd ever seen. The photos ranged from his baby days to what looked like his 21st birthday. I assumed he was around that age but never asked, and she never mentioned it.

About a year after I moved in, I saw an incredibly attractive guy in our building. I was about 70% sure it was the same kid from the pictures, though he looked older than I expected. When he introduced himself, I found out I was right. We started talking whenever he visited his grandmother, and soon we began dating.

We‚Äôve been together for 8 months now. He‚Äôs met my parents, and everything has been going well. Last week, I wanted him to meet my college friends and my twin sister, who‚Äôs currently in town. We all went out to dinner. Although it wasn‚Äôt explicitly discussed, it was kind of assumed that I would cover the bill‚Äîusually, when someone introduces their boyfriend to the group, the couple pays.

The dinner went really well. My friends (a group of four) and my sister all seemed genuinely happy for us. I was sharing the story of how I met him and his grandmother. At some point, my boyfriend stepped away to take a call. That‚Äôs when my friend Sara suddenly called me a pedophile.

I was honestly shocked. When I asked her if she was serious, she just said, ‚ÄúI know a pedophile when I see one.‚Äù I was so disturbed by her words that I excused myself. I paid the bill‚Äîexcept for Sara‚Äîand left with my boyfriend.

Later, she messaged me saying that besides being a pedophile, I‚Äôm also petty and cheap. It really hurt. I absolutely despise abusers, especially child abusers, so being called something like that has taken a serious emotional toll on me. I‚Äôm disgusted by her and the whole situation.

What‚Äôs been bugging me even more is that Sara was abused by a family member as a child. So now I keep questioning myself. Did I do something wrong?

My sister and two of my friends are standing by me. Another friend said she doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a pedophile, but she finds it ‚Äúa bit creepy‚Äù that I saw him as a baby before we met.

My boyfriend (30M) actually found it funny at first, but after seeing how upset I‚Äôve been, he‚Äôs been reassuring me and telling me it‚Äôs not weird at all.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I know I‚Äôm not a pedophile, but it‚Äôs been really upsetting to be seen as one by someone I once trusted.

Settemmezzo - S7B5 - Carciofo! Really good. Vegetal, light cola, orange. Delish.  

Blu Amaro - S7B4 - Strong whiskey flavor to start. Mint, licorice. Never had a whiskey based amaro before and it‚Äôs interesting, but probably wouldn‚Äôt get again.  

Estense - S7B5 - The unofficial amaro of Ferrara. Roasty on the palate, baking spice, bitter orange. Good!  

Scuppoz - S6B7 - Bitter! And a little sweet. Strong gentian. Baking spice. Lingering bitterness.

Sabbenerica - S7B5 - Carciofo, cinnamon. Super well balanced and delicious.

Petrognola Bestia Rara - S6B5 - Strange one. Made with stout as the base. Almost has a tequila flavor. Roasty malt. Coffee.

Has anyone ever faced a problem with their machine's lever getting stuck when opening it? I can handle it if I go from below (from the capsule holder place) and like do a little push with my finger and it releases. But it's happening everytime I pull it up again, it seems like a mechanical problem like something is not ""clicked"" into the right position.
But when I make the coffee, I even have to keep my hands on the lever because it starts pushing up itself due to high pressure I guess. I also realized that the amount of coffee is much less, like half of the original size and the remaining half is going to the capsule holder.
My machine is De'Longhi CitiZ&milk, it's around 13 years old, never had a problem with it. 
I am moving soon so I was planning to replace it with a new one either way, but that one I intend to use only in my new home.

Do you have any tips? 
Do you think it's worth to bring the old one to repair it even if it's only for ~6-8 months use?

1k2s3al,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k2s3al/aitah_for_not_paying_for_my_friends_dinner_when/,AITAH FOR NOT PAYING FOR MY FRIEND'S DINNER WHEN SHE CALLED ME A PEDOPHILE,"Last time I posted on Reddit, I received some wonderful advice, and I even suggested my friend do the same. She‚Äôs using my throwaway account now.

I (29F) moved into my current apartment two years ago. We have an elderly neighbor (in her late 70s) who mostly keeps to herself. She gets her groceries and medicines delivered every week, but the newspaper delivery boy only drops the paper on the ground floor. Before I moved in, she used to pay some neighborhood kids to bring it up to her, but they moved away shortly after I arrived. So, I started bringing her the paper every day. I usually ring the bell and leave it at her door, but when the door is already open, we sometimes have a little chat. She often insists I come in for coffee and always thanks me warmly.

I noticed her apartment is filled with pictures of her grandson‚Äîprobably more than 20. To be honest, I thought he was the cutest baby I‚Äôd ever seen. The photos ranged from his baby days to what looked like his 21st birthday. I assumed he was around that age but never asked, and she never mentioned it.

About a year after I moved in, I saw an incredibly attractive guy in our building. I was about 70% sure it was the same kid from the pictures, though he looked older than I expected. When he introduced himself, I found out I was right. We started talking whenever he visited his grandmother, and soon we began dating.

We‚Äôve been together for 8 months now. He‚Äôs met my parents, and everything has been going well. Last week, I wanted him to meet my college friends and my twin sister, who‚Äôs currently in town. We all went out to dinner. Although it wasn‚Äôt explicitly discussed, it was kind of assumed that I would cover the bill‚Äîusually, when someone introduces their boyfriend to the group, the couple pays.

The dinner went really well. My friends (a group of four) and my sister all seemed genuinely happy for us. I was sharing the story of how I met him and his grandmother. At some point, my boyfriend stepped away to take a call. That‚Äôs when my friend Sara suddenly called me a pedophile.

I was honestly shocked. When I asked her if she was serious, she just said, ‚ÄúI know a pedophile when I see one.‚Äù I was so disturbed by her words that I excused myself. I paid the bill‚Äîexcept for Sara‚Äîand left with my boyfriend.

Later, she messaged me saying that besides being a pedophile, I‚Äôm also petty and cheap. It really hurt. I absolutely despise abusers, especially child abusers, so being called something like that has taken a serious emotional toll on me. I‚Äôm disgusted by her and the whole situation.

What‚Äôs been bugging me even more is that Sara was abused by a family member as a child. So now I keep questioning myself. Did I do something wrong?

My sister and two of my friends are standing by me. Another friend said she doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a pedophile, but she finds it ‚Äúa bit creepy‚Äù that I saw him as a baby before we met.

My boyfriend (30M) actually found it funny at first, but after seeing how upset I‚Äôve been, he‚Äôs been reassuring me and telling me it‚Äôs not weird at all.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I know I‚Äôm not a pedophile, but it‚Äôs been really upsetting to be seen as one by someone I once trusted.

1k2s2vf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k2s2vf,Inner Mongolia - Ordos City Travel (2-3Days),"Hi everyone! I recently visited Ordos City for two days as I wanted to explore something new. I been in China for a few years and can speak mandarin. 

To get started, I recommend having these apps down! 
1. DianPing - China‚Äôs Yelp and TripAdvisor. You can find restaurants, bars, actives etc. 
2. WeChat - Absolutely necessary. 
3. Alipay - Best for foreign card use and transportation if you use the buses for Inner Mongolia. 
4. Didi/Dida Chuxing. WeChat and Alipay has Didi, but for long haul trips Dida is cheaper 
5. XiaoHongShu - best for finding trendy places by wannabe social media influencers, but I found that it‚Äôs mostly difficult to find anything on here for Ordos City. 
6. Baidu maps / Amap. You will need a Chinese maps app because Apple and Google do not cut it for this region. 

Day 1: Arrival
I got to Ejin Horo at night, and booking a didi was easy. I Booked a hotel at the Dong Sheng district called Jinsha International Hotel. Èî¶Âé¶ÂõΩÈôÖÂ§ßÈÖíÂ∫ó‰∏úËÉú„ÄÇThe didi was 140yuan on an upfront fare discount express (1 hour) 

If you want to book a tour guide, this hotel will can give you a WeChat contact, and you can usually choose between XiangShaWan (desert amusement park), the grasslands, and the Genghis Khan Mausoleum. I chose xiangshawan because only starting in May are the grasslands green. I contacted the hotel through Trip. com and got the hotel‚Äôs WeChat, and they gave me the tour guides WeChat. 

If booking, they will ask for a passport photo, DOB, name, etc to register for China Tourism. very smooth booking, and it cost 450rmb a person including (carpooled) carfare, insurance, and admission ticket. 

At the hotel, I WaiMai‚Äôd (ÁæéÂõ¢Â§ñÂçñ) delivery for some Mongolian Dumplings ËíôÂè§ÁÉßÈ∫¶and Lamb offal soup ÊùÇÁ¢éÊ±§„ÄÇsuper awesome.  

Day 2: Desert Time 

Xiangshawan was fun. I met up with the tour guide and the rest of the small group. Drove there, did some desert activities, and they have a lot of food options, so it‚Äôs not a bad place to hang out at. 

I chose to do a tour guide because while it might be easy to get to XiangShaWan (1 hour drive from dongsheng), coming back would most likely be a metered fare, and might cost as much as the whole tour anyway. 

Returned to DongSheng district. 

I reserved a restaurant on DianPing and booked a didi to eat at ÈÑÇÂêâ‰ºòÁâßÈ•≠Â∫ó, and ate some lamb stomach stuffed with lamb meat ËÇöÂåÖËÇâ,blood sausage, and a fried meat pie. Their menu has pictures too. Very good! 

Then I went to a cocktail bar called Enjoy Âç∞ Bar, and their cocktail program is awesome. Highly recommend it. They have various milk washes and good ideas. Easy to find to book on Didi. 

Then slept. 

Day 3: Kang Bashi 

I checked out of the hotel and booked a didi to the Kang Bashi district (45 minutes) 
It‚Äôs not really a ghost town haha! It‚Äôs actually quite beautiful with the recent development. 

I went to eat at Iron Man Barbecue ÈìÅ‰∫∫ÁÉßÁÉ§, and ordered a whole roast goat leg ÁÉ§ÁæäËÖø„ÄÇFor about 350 RMB, you get a 2kg leg, yogurt, veggies, etc. Super delicious and well worth the 45 minute wait for the cook time. 

I then visited the Â∫∑Â∑¥‰ªÄÊñ∞Âå∫‰ºäÂÖãÊïñÂåÖ ÔºàKang Bashi Ovoo) which is a huge monument that has a few flights of stairs. But at the top you can see the entirety of Ordos city. Wonderful view! It was free admission when I went, and not a lot of people.

I then went to a chain called ‰øèÂï§Â∞èÁâõNaughty Calf, for some skewers and on Draught Craft Beer. Honestly their vanilla coffee stout, at 17rmb per pint was spectacular. Really good! 

Then I headed back to the airport and went back to PVG. 

I unfortunately missed the fountain show that evening, but I‚Äôm still grateful for what I got to see!!!

If you have any questions please let me know!!! 
It‚Äôs hard to put everything into one post.

Around age 22 I had an endoscopy/colonoscopy plus biopsys. Gastro found absolutely nothing at all wrong with me in any of those areas but diagnosed me with GERD and started me on 40mg pantoprozol once daily based off my symptoms.
My symptoms at the time were: chronic gas build up in chest, excessive burping, painful hiccuping, daily regurgitation, horrible chest pains, lump in throat, hoarse voice, acid in mouth often, burning in esophagus, excessive sweating, heart palpations.
Being on pantoprozol changed my life! For the first time in years I felt amazing! I could even eat whatever I wanted! I was a whole new person!
Untill I wasn't...
Around 2 years ago (age ~25) my acid issues began to come back and with a vengeance. All the same issues as before but including new issues as well such as dizziness every time I felt acid build up, horrible sinus and ear issues, post nasal issues like never before, and chest pain that seems to extend out into all my limbs. I've been battling this hell consistently non-stop since the start of 2025 trying to find an answer before the end of the year for insurance reasons. I've seen 3 ENTs, an Allergist, a Neurologist, my primary care doctor, and gone back to my gastro.
ENTs all sucked. They litterally had LPR flyers in their offices and when I'd try to talk to them about it they were like deer in headlights, had no clue what I was on about. We never found any issues with my eustachian tubes or anything after countless testing and throwing antibotics and steroids at me.
Allergist was helpful a little. I officially have zero allergies and turns out my life-long asthma diagnosis was WRONG, I tested negative for asthma, she said I have something called Vocal Cord Dysfunction which she said was likely caused by acid issues.
Gastro blamed my issues on my weight (I had gained 40lbs in the last 5 years since I'd seen her last) and she upped my pantoprozol 40mg to twice daily. That helped at first but it's not good enough still, even once small bite of trigger food will send me into a vomiting spree 

Other things to note: I sleep on a wedge pillow, that helped my ear issues imo. I am on a GERD savy diet that I only slightly go off of during social dinners. My main trigger seems to be heavily processed foods, onions, tomatoes, corn syrup, citric acid. Coffee never bothers me.

Looking for any sort of insight at all. I'm 8k in the hole with medical bills and I'm just feeling lost, like where do I go next? Tonight I woke up at 3am from how intense the chest pain was and I had to ask myself for the 100th time ""is this a heart attack???""",1,1745052503.0,GERD,2,1.0,False

Morning strain for pain relief and IBS stomach related issues 

I've had this in a jar for a week now with a boveda pack. 
To be honest the smell is still quite muted but there is something, kind of like creamy kees but something else too. Fruity/citrus type and reminds me a little of Tripoli when it was good.
When holding the bud up to my nose I'm not getting much smell at all.
The moisture content is spot on for me and isn't too harsh on the throat when vaping, there is a bit of bounce in the bud when squeezed and has a good solid feel to it. 
They are well trimmed and look really nice,  fresh with the odd purple fleck running through and covered in trichomes. 
What lets them down is the size, the whole 10g pack is basically smalls and popcorn size.
The tastet isn't too bad and tastes better than it smells,a kind of creamy floral taste, nothing to rave about just alright. Certainly not unpleasant.
The effects are not bad at all, better than vanilla ice and on par with creamy kees, it's a nice mellow old school feel, great for ""wake n bake"" if you medicate first thing in the morning, it's enough to feel and take the edge off but not enough to couch lock you. So I'm able to have a vape and a coffee and get on with my day. 
For ¬£5.50 it's priced accordingly and it's consistent with safricanna quality. A not bad budget daytime strain.

Eventually, she told me (according to her) that she had autism.

Most of our conversations felt pretty one-sided. We once planned to meet at the park, but she canceled last minute, saying she had hurt her leg. After she told me about her autism, she often claimed I was treating her differently.

She opened up about her past, telling me her ex had left her, and that another guy she had been seeing replaced her not long after. I remember one day I got mugged and nearly lost her number ‚Äî oddly enough, she barely reacted and told me she wouldn‚Äôt text unless I messaged first.

She used to talk about her cats all the time, and she mentioned her nephews were also autistic. I recall she once got really mad when her cousin brought up the fact she used to drink with her ex.

At one point, I invited her to go to the movies, since she was always saying we never went out. She refused at first, saying she was too shy, but after I insisted, she agreed. The very next day, she asked me: ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be better if we were just friends?‚Äù

Still, we ended up going to the movies. We met there, bought some candy, kissed during the film, and later spent the afternoon cuddling. She never let me check her phone, always stayed distant, and only shared her Instagram with me after we broke up.

Another time, we went to the mall. She gave me some chocolate, and we ended up at a motel. Once there, she said she was feeling too embarrassed and asked to keep the lights off. I said it was fine, but her mood shifted completely and she became defensive.

Before that, we had spent an afternoon kissing at the park, and when it was time for her to leave, I offered to walk her home. It always felt like she was avoiding introducing me to her family. I walked her back and left.

On another occasion, her sister dropped her off at my place. I mentioned we didn‚Äôt go out much because she was always making excuses, and she got really mad at me for saying that.

One day, we were gaming together, and I criticized the game ‚Äî she got upset and stopped playing. Later, she brought me chocolate, we hung out for a while, and soon after she brought up the idea of breaking up.

She once invited me to a party, but later said she wasn‚Äôt going anymore, only to change her mind at the last minute. I got annoyed and asked if she even wanted me to go with her. I told her I‚Äôd go, and asked if I could arrive a bit earlier, but she made it clear I should only show up at 6 PM.

I went earlier anyway. Her sister saw me on the street and invited me upstairs. Later we went to her friend‚Äôs party, and she introduced me as her boyfriend. Out of nowhere, she looked at me and said, ‚ÄúShould we download an app to find a hot girl for you?‚Äù

After the party, we went back to her place. She asked me to stay the night, but I ended up leaving.

After all these situations, I called her and ended things. She started crying and blocked me. Later, she told me I had pushed her into therapy and that I had stolen her happiness.

Even so, she texted me later, saying she missed me more than she expected. We started talking again. One day, while we were still talking, I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she claimed she was actually looking for her friend‚Äôs ex.

In the end, I told her I loved her. She said the feeling would pass and told me she had gone somewhere and wished I was there. Later, she called and invited me to her mother‚Äôs birthday party, but I didn‚Äôt go. Her mother even called me, asking if I loved her. Later, her mom invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again, and she told me her father was extremely mad at me. I felt awful and ended up venting about it online. She found out, confronted me, and said I had lied to and used her ‚Äî that her behavior was all because of her insecurities and autism ‚Äî and that she had prayed for me every single day. After that, she blocked me and disappeared.

I know this is far more than a lot are getting on here and I almost feel bad for posting but I guess the dead bedroom is defined by the satisfaction and fulfilment right? No kids or pets, moved into first home a month ago.

Well once a week and only on my initiation. It's not just thr need for sex, it's the need to feel wanted, to actually feel like your partner lusts for you and wants to rip your clothes off.

4 days ago I was finishing up cleaning the kitchen after cooking a meal and came up behind my partner and kissed her neck and hugged her tight from behind, kissing her ears and whispering how I want to fuck her here on the counter. She shrugs me off and says later. Of course later doesn't come because I don't initiate later, thinking the onus is on her now. She does say how she would have had sex with me in the kitchen earlier if hadn't outright said about it. Tbh I kinda get that, seems more spontaneous and passionate. I was kissing her neck and holding her from behind thoogh so it wasn't as if I said it out of nowhere.

Queue the next day and I'm sitting on the sofa having a coffee and she comes into the room saying ""come to bed and get naked"". I tell her I'm tired from work so that's that. I know if I went it would be then me injecting any sort of passion into it. It'd be straight to penetrative sex with little to no foreplay while she uses her vibe to get off and I try to time to finish with her.

I try to woo her and get her in the mood and just because I open my mouth about fucking she's not up for it,  but can snap her finger for me! I do the brunt of the housework, outdoor work, organise finances (we pay 50/50) so it's not like I'm not pulling my weight. 

I'm sorry if i come across as entitled because once a week would be heaven for most here, but I can't help how I feel.

Before pregnancy I loved coffee so much. I would have 4 cups a days of black coffee just because I liked the taste of it. Then HG happened and coffee was among the first things that I despised even the smell of. I asked my husband not to kiss me in the morning because his breath would smell of coffee. I made him open the windows when he would brew his own coffee long before I would enter the room. I genuinely thought coffee and I had parted way, once and for all. 

Fast forward to today, 20 weeks into my HG pregnancy, my husband made me an instant latte with a dash of cinnamon and I absolutely loved it. A huge win for us.

And I got an overwhelming support from the community, with tips, advice, and some hard truths as well. With my third launch happening, I promised myself not to give up easily, and to work on improving my marketing strategy, and the way I think about what is needed to launch a product. One of the things I learned is that I should spend as much time in marketing as I do in coding, which is hard for me, but here we go, a first proper attempt.

For the past few weeks, my weekends have looked a lot like this: coding, coffee, and very little sleep. Why? Because I was thinking a lot about AI chatbots. ChatGPT is great, but honestly, the UI could use some work, and the $20/month price tag felt like overkill for how I was using it. I thought, ""There has to be a better way ‚Äì something more streamlined and affordable.""

So, I decided to build it myself.

It's not just another chatbot; it's the AI assistant I always wanted. It's designed to be lightning-fast, intuitive, and affordable. I call it Pegna Chat.

What does that actually mean?

\- It's Fast:¬†I'm talking¬†noticeably¬†faster than ChatGPT. I built it to save¬†me¬†time, and I think it can save you time too.

\- It's Affordable:¬†I wanted something that wouldn't break the bank. Pegna Chat is priced at about half the cost of a ChatGPT subscription.

\- It's Growing:¬†This isn't just a chatbot. I'm building a suite of AI-powered tools around it. Right now, I'm working on Pega Writer, which is like Cursor for content creators. It's an AI-first markdown editor with a powerful AI agent that analyzes your text and suggests improvements, just like Cursor does for code.

How did I make it fast and affordable?

\- Smart Model Selection:¬†Pegna Chat uses a smart model selector that evaluates the complexity of your query and forwards it to the appropriate LLM. Simple queries get routed to faster models, prioritizing speed.

\- Strategic Pricing:¬†We offer a free plan, but it's designed more as a trial for potential premium users. This helps ensure that our paid users aren't burdened by the load of free users. We also rely on a combination of small and larger models to keep pricing competitive.

\- Generous Limits:¬†Our paid plan has usage limits, but they're very generous. All our test users have yet to reach them.

This is a passion project for me, I do have a full time job that covers the bill, so I like to build for the fun of it, and I'm really excited about this one. I'm constantly working to improve Pegna Chat and add new features.

Launch Promotion!¬†To celebrate the launch, the first 100 users get a free month and then pay only $9 afterwards using the promo code:¬†LAUNCH25.

If you're curious, I'd love for you to give it a try and let me know what you think. Send me your feedback and report any bugs ‚Äì I'll gladly give away free subscriptions to anyone who helps make the platform better!

So I‚Äôm 22F, my boyfriend Liam is 24M, and his best mate Dan is 23M. We‚Äôre all staying in a hotel down the coast for the weekend ‚Äì planned it a while ago just for a chill break, beach, drinks, sleep in, no dramas. Liam and Dan have been best mates for years, and usually they‚Äôre tight as. Like, always joking around, finishing each other‚Äôs dumb sentences, never a dull moment.

But for whatever reason, this trip has been non-stop pettiness between them. From literally the first night, they started getting snarky over little things. Dan cracked the shits because Liam used the coffee mug from the hotel room that Dan had apparently ‚Äúclaimed.‚Äù Then Liam made a joke about Dan‚Äôs haircut ‚Äì which he‚Äôs done before without issue ‚Äì and Dan just fully gave him the silent treatment for hours. When we went for a drive, Dan kept giving Liam shit about how slow he drives, acting like a backseat parent, and Liam eventually just snapped and told him to walk next time.

Even stupid stuff like who‚Äôs better at cooking got weird. We made dinner in the little kitchenette one night and they were actually trying to one-up each other over who could cook sausages ‚Äúproperly.‚Äù Then it was Mario Kart in the room and they ended up yelling at each other over ‚Äúcheating‚Äù and rules that they made up on the spot. I'm just sitting there like... is this what I signed up for?

Any time we try to do something relaxed ‚Äì go for a walk, hang by the pool, even just sit and watch a movie ‚Äì one of them finds a way to make it awkward. And they both act like the other one‚Äôs being a dick, so neither wants to back down. Liam reckons Dan‚Äôs being moody and Dan says Liam‚Äôs got an attitude lately. No one‚Äôs saying what‚Äôs actually going on and I‚Äôm just stuck in the middle trying to keep the peace like a human buffer.

It‚Äôs honestly wrecked the vibe and I‚Äôm so over it. I was looking forward to this weekend so much and now I‚Äôm just counting down until we go home. I miss when they were being goofy and laughing and not acting like grumpy siblings stuck in a car for too long.

I've decided I need to be tough and teach them to stop being childish or I'm checking out of this trip.  I've decided i'm going to sit them down, make each one of them explain precisely what is going on, why they've been acting this way, and to apologise to each other and start being nice again. If they don't both agree to this, I'm not talking to either of them for the rest of the trip and I'm checking out and will find my own way home.  Would that be too far?  I don't know what else to do at this point and feel like I need to be the adult around two ridiculous children.

1k2rhjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1k2rhjf/my_journey_from_complete_enmeshment_to_nocontact/,My journey from complete enmeshment to no-contact at 32,"I have been lurking on forums focused on emotional neglect, emotionally immature parents, and narcissism  for probably a decade (I‚Äôm now 35), and I suddenly had the urge to write down my journey with my own emotionally immature parent and my decision to go no-contact. It turned into quite an essay but I‚Äôve tried to highlight my main points so you can skip if that is easier. This is absolutely not a recommendation that going no-contact is the solution for all - I just wanted to share my experience and why it felt right for me, as it has been a long, complicated journey to reach this point.

As a bit of background, I grew up with just my mother, no siblings, and my father was not in the picture. My mother has always been extremely emotionally immature, though her traits could also probably be described as narcissistic. She has a limited capacity for understanding or caring about the feelings of others, and pretty much sees people in terms of what they can provide for her. Do they have money? Do they have status? Do they make her feel intelligent or validated?

Unsurprisingly my mother never maintained a long term relationship (I was conceived via a one night stand), and she also struggled to maintain long term friendships. This created a perfect storm for enmeshment and from around the age of eight I became her personal therapist / friend / parent ‚Äì whatever was needed from her at the time. I learned that my feelings were irrelevant and I needed to keep my mother happy. We also continuously had money issues since she was incapable of thinking long term, and her spending relative to income was consequently very excessive. To this day she has never saved any money, and if an unexpected expense comes up she will ask a relative or put it on a credit card. She has never thought about a pension and I suspect she always thought I would handle things when she retires.

With hindsight I can now clearly see how damaging it was to put adult worries on a child, but at the time I had no idea that it could be any other way. It was so ingrained in me that I had to keep her happy. It has taken me years to resist the compulsion to appease her. Far into my twenties, I did everything I could do meet her demands when she ¬†would complain about me going on holiday without her, not having her stay at my house enough, or not getting the right gift for birthdays / Christmas.

In my early teens our relationship became more volatile. She really struggled with me making friends and starting to have some independence, and her relationship to me started to become more like a jealous sister. She would have tantrums if I didn‚Äôt include her when my friends came over, and her temper generally became more extreme and she would have screaming sessions at me over little things. Years later in my twenties when my now husband and I were staying over at her house he remembers me waking up in the morning and the first thing I said was ‚Äúshe‚Äôs angry with me‚Äù, because of the sound of her steps in the house (and later concluding, yes she was angry with both of us for not including her enough).

I think my late teen years to late twenties were in some way the hardest. I started to acknowledge that I really didn‚Äôt enjoy spending time with her. In fact my body has quite an extreme reaction ‚Äì increased heart rate, terrible IBS, and then extremely low mood after seeing her. I felt intense guilt about this and I genuinely believed I must be a terrible person for finding interactions with my own mother so stressful. The only person I began to share these feelings with was my boyfriend (now husband) and eventually some therapists and councillors who had varying levels of insights. Additionally in my early twenties I discovered forums like raised by narcissists and and guiltily scrolled through posts feeling so validated to hear from people who had similar experiences. Sometimes I would see posts from people who had gone no-contact and I would wish my mother would do something significant enough for me to warrant going no-contact. Until I was past thirty, I always assumed I HAD to make things work with my mother no matter what. I could not have conceived of the idea that in the future I would break contact with her.

**There were a few key factors / events in the years leading to me going no-contact that impacted my decision:**

* **Having my own children** ‚Äì I think it is pretty common that when you become a parent it will bring to the surface a lot of feelings about how you were treated as a child. When you see how vulnerable and innocent your own child is, and take in the enormity of how much responsibility you have to support them, it is inconceivable that anyone would neglect them, emotionally or otherwise. During the newborn phase especially, I‚Äôd never felt more like I needed the support of a parent. My mother gave me the silent treatment because we did not have her come to stay with us once I was back from the hospital after having my first child. This is especially ridiculous since she has never been a supportive figure in our lives and has always treated us as her butlers when she comes to stay. I don‚Äôt know if it was the sleep deprivation or general emotional state I was in but I took responsibility for making amends after her silent treatment. Several days after I had made contact with her she asked me lend her money. I regret trying to be the bigger person here and I think it would have been a good time to cut contact with her. As my first child got older, I saw how wonderful it is to see a toddler‚Äôs joy at the various holidays, and I wasn‚Äôt willing to ruin them anymore by stressing myself out over my mother and focusing all my attention on her. I had begun to associate all holidays, birthdays, Christmas etc with extreme stress, but this has significantly changed since going no contact, and I‚Äôve had my first few holiday periods with the ability to just enjoy the day.
* **The physical and mental toll became too much ‚Äì** I‚Äôd spent over a decade trying to appease her and meet her demands for gifts, holidays, etc, but she was never satisfied. Several years after having my first child, I had begun to see how much contact with her was impacting me. It wasn‚Äôt even just the time I spent with her. It would be the weeks in the run up to it. I would start worrying in October about how we co-ordinate Christmas so that she doesn‚Äôt cause drama and make everything about her. One Christmas, when we finally got her to leave our house and I had just dropped her off at the train station, I looked at my fitness watch and my heart rate had suddenly dropped by over 50%. I couldn‚Äôt believe the how much of a physical impact the stress was having on me.
* **Another significant event** ‚Äì I will keep this pretty vague but essentially there was a big fall out just at the time I had already decided I wanted to limit contact. At this stage I said I needed space, but what this ultimately turned into was several years of no contact. She did make some vague attempts to reach out and suggested that we meet for coffee so I could explain things but I had made so many attempts to explain things previously, with her ultimately not having the capacity to understand. I think in most cases, narcissistic / emotionally immature parents are not going to be able to understand how they have hurt you, no matter how well you explain it. They also have a tendency to deny and defend ‚Äì ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember that!‚Äù. So ultimately I just told her I didn‚Äôt feel further explanations would be helpful and I still needed space.

I have never concretely said to her that I want to be no-contact forever, and I do accept there is some possibility that in the future I would consider some contact. For example if I felt like I was better able to accept her behaviour, or if there was some miraculous reflection on her part. But for now, I just want to focus on my own life, rather than the person who has already taken so much of my energy. Periodic contact with my mother (however infrequent I arranged our visits) kept me in a perpetual state of anger and frustration. I must have spent countless hours ranting about her behaviour, seeking out validating posts on subs like this. It took me a long time to acknowledge that I either needed to accept my mother as she is and set my expectations accordingly, or cut contact with her.

A comedian (I think maybe Paul Gilmartin?) described going no-contact with his mother as ‚Äúthe best vacation he ever had‚Äù, and this is really how it felt. Once I went no-contact with her I was better able to accept her, and the situation, and focus on how I improve things for myself.

**To summarise the main realisations I had (and some of these took a long time):**

**1. There does not need to be a significant event or physical abuse to justify going no contact**

This was a really difficult belief for me to overcome as my mother did not physically abuse me or do anything else I felt significant enough to warrant going no-contact. It took me a long time to come to the realisation that the way she made me feel when I spent time with her was enough to make a change. In no other relationship (friendship, romantic or professional) would I put up with those behaviours, so why would I put up with it in this specific instance? ¬†

**2. Many close friends and family members will not understand, and that is ok**

I think unless you have a friend or family member who has had a dysfunctional relationship with their parent, they are not going to understand your situation, and may even outright invalidate your feelings. Especially for people who have had one or more loving parents in their lives, it is incredibly hard for them to imagine a situation where a parent only prioritises their own feelings. The only people in my life I would say truly understand it are my husband (he has seen it all first hand) and a close friend who has a dysfunctional relationship with her parents. In any other friendships I have I will try not to disclose much about my relationship with my mother if it comes up because there is too much opportunity for misunderstanding. ¬†I have had extended family members tell me ‚ÄúI will regret not reconciling with my mother when she dies‚Äù, ‚Äúeveryone has issues with their parents‚Äù, ‚Äúfamily is family‚Äù. Thankfully I am now in a position where I am better able to trust my own judgement, but it is still painful to be misunderstood by loved ones.

**3. You may have some positive memories of childhood, or other periods of your life with the emotionally immature parent, but you can‚Äôt base a current relationship purely on history**

I have some fond memories of my childhood and my mother certainly got some things right. She was pretty creative and came up with a lot of interesting things for us to do when I was little. She massively encouraged reading, and was supportive of hobbies I wanted to pursue. These fond memories have made the situation more confusing when I reflect on how I now feel about her. It is entirely possible to have both positive and negative memories of a parent you choose to go no contact with.

**4. It is unlikely you will ever feel fully healed, and that is ok**

It goes without saying that growing up without a stable parent who loves you unconditionally is likely to lead to mental health issues and neuroses. For me, I had plenty ‚Äì anxiety, periods of depression, eating disorders starting early in my teens. I also have the classic ‚Äúpeople pleasing‚Äù trait where regardless of what I truly think, in many situations I just feel compelled to say or do what I think the other person wants. To this day I have to aggressively fight this internally. Lastly, if your childhood is entirely focused on someone else‚Äôs happiness I think you can miss the opportunity to develop your own identity, and understand your own personality, interests and values.

When I entered therapy, I imagined working towards a state of full enlightenment and recovery where I had no residual neuroses from the relationship with my mother, and I was not triggered by situations or people that reminded me of her. I‚Äôve since been able to understand that these types of journeys are ongoing, and while I continue to make progress, I‚Äôm not going to reach this unrealistic perfect state.

**5. Going no contact doesn‚Äôt mean you hate your parent**

To many people I think going no contact seems like a cruel punishment to inflict on people you hate. I don‚Äôt hate my mother. I feel sad for her, and I saw for many years that her lack of emotional awareness and consideration for others really damaged her relationships in her work and personal life. She has driven away some really wonderful people, and made life a lot harder for herself, but she really doesn‚Äôt know how to be any other way. While I feel sad for her, I am not her parent, and don‚Äôt feel capable or willing to take that role on. For now, it is best for my sanity to have no contact.

**The things that have helped over the past decade** (in addition to support from loved ones already discussed):

* **Therapy** ‚Äì therapy has been very helpful, but finding the right person is very important. I have had a few different therapists and counsellors and I could have definitely been more selective initially, and not just gone for the person who came along.
* **Philosophy** ‚Äì I unexpectedly found getting into philosophy in some ways even more helpful for my anxiety than therapy. When dealing with anger and frustration with questions like ‚Äúwhy couldn‚Äôt I have had a better parent?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhy is this so unfair?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhy is this person so unreasonable?‚Äù, one philosophy that particularly helped was Stoicism which focuses on what is within your control and basically helped me to acknowledge, yes life is unfair, but it is how you think about it and act that is important. If anyone has any interest in this I recommend ‚ÄúHow to think like a roman emperor ‚Äì the Stoic Philosophy of Marcus Aurelius‚Äù which is a brilliant introduction to stoicism and brings philosophy and therapy together.
* **Books** ‚Äì Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents (Lindsay Gibson), The Emotional Incest Syndrome (Patricia Love), I‚Äôm Glad my Mom Died (Jeannette McCurdy)
* **Podcasts** ‚Äì I‚Äôve enjoyed listening to ¬†old episodes of Christina Pazsitzky ‚Äì That‚Äôs Deep Bro. She‚Äôs a comedian who has dealt with things like going no contact with her own mother and talks about her own realisations and things that have helped, with a pretty no nonsense attitude.

I appreciate this ended up very long. Too be honest there is so much I left out. It really is so hard to describe this type of experience without over simplifying. There are a lot of crazy things my mother has done and said that I could have mentioned but I wanted to try and focus on progress rather than turn this into a long rant. If anyone relates I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Thank you if you read all of this.",2,1745050640.0,emotionalneglect,0,1.0,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The 60 ml cup may seem like a basic item, but a closer look reveals significant differences in features that impact its suitability for various tasks. These features range from the materials used in construction to the precision of the measurement markings. Understanding these details will help you choose the best cup for your specific needs.

**Material Composition:** The material from which a 60 ml cup is made directly impacts its durability, chemical resistance, and suitability for different temperatures. Options include glass, stainless steel, plastic (various types), and even silicone.

The choice of material often depends on the intended use. For instance, glass offers excellent clarity and resistance to chemical leaching, making it ideal for measuring ingredients in a kitchen setting. Stainless steel is known for its durability and resistance to corrosion, suitable for both hot and cold liquids, and provides a professional aesthetic. Plastic cups offer affordability and lightweight convenience, while silicone provides flexibility and heat resistance, useful for baking or crafting.

**Measurement Accuracy:** Accurate measurement is paramount when using a 60 ml cup, whether for precise coffee extraction, controlled dosages of medicine, or crafting recipes. Look for cups with clearly marked and reliably calibrated measurement indicators.

Some cups feature embossed markings, while others utilize printed lines. Embossed markings are typically more durable and less prone to fading over time. The granularity of the markings is also important; some cups offer only a 60 ml line, while others include increments like 15 ml, 30 ml, and 45 ml for greater versatility. Calibration accuracy should be verified if precise measurements are crucial, especially in professional settings.

**Handle Design and Ergonomics:** A well-designed handle can significantly improve the usability and comfort of a 60 ml cup, especially when handling hot liquids or measuring multiple portions.

The handle should provide a secure grip and prevent accidental spills. Factors to consider include the size, shape, and material of the handle. Some cups feature ergonomic handles designed to fit comfortably in the hand, while others offer a simple loop or no handle at all. Cups without handles are generally more stackable, but less convenient to use when filled with hot liquids.

**Durability and Heat Resistance:** The longevity of a 60 ml cup is directly related to its durability and ability to withstand temperature variations. These factors are particularly important if the cup will be used frequently or exposed to extreme conditions.

Cups made from high-quality materials like borosilicate glass or stainless steel offer superior durability and heat resistance. They can withstand repeated use, cleaning, and exposure to hot or cold liquids without cracking or degrading. Plastic cups may be less durable and more prone to melting or warping at high temperatures, so itÈà•Ê™ö important to choose a material specifically designed for heat resistance if needed.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Keeping a 60 ml cup clean and sanitary is essential, especially when used for food preparation or medical purposes. Consider the material and design of the cup when evaluating its ease of cleaning.

Smooth surfaces, such as glass or stainless steel, are generally easier to clean than textured surfaces. Cups with wide openings are easier to access and scrub. Dishwasher-safe materials offer added convenience, while cups with intricate designs or hard-to-reach areas may require more thorough hand washing. Some materials, like certain plastics, can retain odors or stains, so choose a material that is easy to sanitize and maintain.

 ## FAQs Section

Many consumers have common questions when considering the purchase of a 60 ml cup. Addressing these questions can provide clarity and confidence in their buying decision.

**What materials are best for a 60 ml cup if I need to measure hot liquids?**
For hot liquids, materials like borosilicate glass, stainless steel, or heat-resistant plastic (such as polypropylene) are best. Borosilicate glass is known for its thermal shock resistance, meaning it can withstand rapid temperature changes without cracking. Stainless steel is durable and can handle high temperatures without leaching chemicals. Heat-resistant plastics are lightweight and affordable, but ensure they are BPA-free and rated for the temperatures you intend to use them at.

**How do I ensure the accuracy of the measurement markings on a 60 ml cup?**
To verify accuracy, you can use a calibrated measuring tool, such as a graduated cylinder or digital scale, to compare the volume indicated on the cup with the actual volume of liquid it holds. If the cup consistently under- or over-measures, it may be faulty. For critical applications, consider purchasing a cup that comes with a certificate of calibration or is known for its precision manufacturing.

**Are 60 ml cups dishwasher safe?**
Whether a 60 ml cup is dishwasher safe depends on the material it is made from. Glass and stainless-steel cups are generally dishwasher safe, but it is always recommended to check the manufacturerÈà•Ê™ö instructions. Some plastics may warp or degrade in high heat, so handwashing is preferable. Silicone cups are typically dishwasher safe, but check the specific product details.

**Can I use a 60 ml cup for measuring dry ingredients?**
While a 60 ml cup is primarily designed for measuring liquids, it can be used for dry ingredients as well, especially for small amounts. However, be aware that the accuracy may be affected by the density and packing of the dry ingredients. For the most accurate measurements of dry ingredients, it is recommended to use dedicated measuring spoons or cups designed for dry ingredients, which account for volume differences due to packing.

**Professional Baristas:** Baristas require precise and durable 60 ml cups for consistently measuring espresso shots. A cup with accurate markings, heat resistance, and an ergonomic handle is essential for efficient and repeatable results in a fast-paced coffee shop environment. The material should be easy to clean and resistant to staining from coffee oils.

**Home Bakers and Cooks:** Home cooks and bakers need versatile 60 ml cups for measuring small amounts of liquids or dry ingredients. A cup with multiple measurement increments (e.g., 15 ml, 30 ml, 45 ml) is beneficial for various recipes. The material should be food-safe and easy to clean. Durability is also important for long-term use.

**Healthcare Professionals:** Healthcare professionals require accurate and sanitary 60 ml cups for dispensing liquid medications. The cup must be made from a medical-grade material that is resistant to chemical leaching and easy to sterilize. Clear and precise measurement markings are critical for ensuring patient safety and compliance.

When asked if she also paid it forward she said no witha huge smile on her face.

She claims that she paid for some  groceries for an elderly woman at her local supermarket, therefore she didn't need to pay forward a coffee.

I commented that the elderly woman had no means of paying it forward for someone else as she didn't have the funds. Therefore by not paying forward the coffee at a different business then stopped the goodwill with her. I also mentioned the employer super contributions outstanding.

She deleted my comment and blocked me.

A paying it forward coffee is not the same as paying out of your good will some groceries.

It's like going to the soup shop in Melbourne saying no I'm not going to pay forward because I got a free ice cream at Ben & Jerry's down the road!
