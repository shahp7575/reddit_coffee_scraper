So I’m using it to write. To confess. To warn. If someone finds this—if you’re reading these pages—it means you’re already too close to the truth. Or maybe the truth is already too close to you.

It started, like most tragedies do, with something beautiful.

I met the love of my life when I was nineteen. I had dropped out of college and moved back home to Sarasota, Florida. That’s when I met Clara. Strangely enough, we’d grown up just five minutes apart and never crossed paths—until she became friends with my younger sister.

I’ll spare you the drawn-out love story. Just know we fell hard and fast. She had a boyfriend at the time, but that didn’t last long. We spent that summer wrapped in each other: watching horror movies, swimming under streetlights, trading playlists, and laughing at everything. It sounds corny, I know. But it was real.

By August, we were official. By January, engaged. We couldn’t even wait for the wedding we planned the next February—we were married that August in a quiet courthouse ceremony.

She got me. In ways no one else ever had. Same sense of humor, same love for movies, same dreams. We were kids, sure. But we were happy.

Three years later, we found out she was pregnant. We had been saving for a small log cabin in the woods—our little dream escape. And on the day I deposited the last $700 into our savings account, everything changed.

I was on my way home. Traffic was crawling. Sirens. Flashing lights up ahead. I was furious at first—punching the steering wheel, yelling into the empty car. My fifteen-minute drive home had turned into an hour because of some wreck.

Then I saw it.

The twisted metal. The smeared blood. And hanging from a shattered rearview mirror, something I recognized immediately: a tiny stuffed octopus Clara kept in her Jeep.

Her green Renegade was crumpled in on itself like a crushed soda can.

My heart dropped through the floor.

I don’t even remember putting the car in park. I was just out—running, screaming her name. “CLARA!” My voice cracked. Nothing answered. I pushed past police tape and paramedics until I got to an ambulance.

“What happened to the woman driving that car?” I asked, breathless, wild-eyed.

They knew. I could see it in their faces.

“She’s on her way to the hospital now,” one EMT said. “Do you know her?”

“I’m her husband.”

He offered to drive me. The ride was only ten minutes, but it felt like a slow eternity. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

When we arrived, she was already gone.

I vomited in the hospital parking lot. I don’t even remember crying, just shaking like I’d been buried in ice.

Later, I made the calls. Parents. Friends. I can still hear her mother’s scream. It’s the kind that rings in your ears long after it stops.

The next couple of weeks were a blur of funeral plans and therapy sessions my parents insisted on. None of it helped.

I couldn’t stay in our home. Her toothbrush. Her scent on the pillow. Her handwriting on sticky notes still on the fridge. I couldn’t breathe in there.

I thought about buying the cabin anyway—living there for both of us—but I knew I couldn’t. Not without her.

So I ran.

That’s how I found Cedar Hollow, West Virginia—a nowhere town hidden deep in the mountains, with less than a thousand people and more trees than cell towers. It was quiet. Secluded. Cheap. It had one church (noticeably rundown and neglected), a small movie theater (really just a 50-seat room that ran one movie each weekend), and a surprisingly clean grocery store that felt like it belonged to a wealthier, much larger town.

It felt like a place to disappear.

And maybe now, I will.

I picked up a remote job doing data entry—nothing glamorous, but it paid the bills and kept me invisible. I avoided people as much as possible. Only left the house to run a few times a week at the park. I had groceries delivered to my porch so I wouldn't have to force small talk with some smiling cashier.

It wasn’t supposed to be permanent.

I just needed time. Time to be alone. To go somewhere no one would ask where I was from—or worse, what had happened to me. I couldn’t stomach telling strangers how I ended up in a forgotten town in West Virginia because I’d just become a 24-year-old widower.

The town was small, but oddly… comfortable. Comfortable in ways that didn’t make sense. The people—though private—always seemed content. No crime. No poverty. Everyone’s homes were modest, but well-kept. Everyone looked like they slept well and aged slowly.

And strangely enough—so did I.

After just a few weeks, I started noticing small changes in myself. I had more energy. My skin looked clearer. The dark circles under my eyes faded, even though I hadn’t changed my routine. I wasn’t eating better—still skipping meals and surviving off frozen dinners—but somehow, I felt… healthy. Sharper. I even dropped a few pounds of stress weight I hadn’t been able to lose for years. My hair looked thicker. My joints stopped aching.

It was the kind of thing you don’t notice all at once—but slowly, it creeps in.

At first, I chalked it up to the clean air or the quiet.

But now, I know.

I’d only been in Cedar Hollow a few months when things started to feel… off.

The town got even quieter. The park, once filled with kids and couples and old men feeding ducks, began to empty out. Each time I went, there were fewer people. Like the whole town was slowly folding in on itself. One afternoon, I ran past the jungle gym and saw the swings swaying—but no wind. No one else was there.

Still, I told myself it was probably just the cold keeping people inside.

Then came the day I had to leave the house—to buy a few things I couldn’t have delivered. Toothpaste. Body wash. Nothing urgent. Just human maintenance.

The store was chaos.

People rushing through the aisles like there was a bomb about to drop. Grabbing canned goods, bottled water, batteries—anything that would last. No one was talking. Just the sounds of carts clattering and shelves being emptied.

I figured maybe a snowstorm was coming. That made sense. It was winter, after all. I hadn’t heard about one, but I also hadn’t spoken to anyone in weeks. Maybe the town had some Facebook group or emergency text thread I wasn’t part of.

So I grabbed some basics too—just in case—and headed home. On the way back, I decided to check my mailbox since I was already out. I rarely got anything but junk or bills.

A thick envelope. No return address. Just a red stamp across the front: **URGENT** — from the Mayor’s Office.

I opened it. It read. “**Town of Cedar Hollow** *Office of the Mayor* Main Street, Cedar Hollow, WV 26304

**URGENT NOTICE** **Annual Town Hall Meeting – Attendance Strongly Encouraged**

To all residents of Cedar Hollow,

This is an official notification that the **Annual Town Hall Meeting** will be held on **Thursday, February 15th at 7:00 PM**, at the Cedar Hollow Community Center.

The meeting was in two days. But I had no intention of going.

I wasn’t part of any neighborhood watch group, and I didn’t need a refresher on winter safety. If a storm hit, I’d manage. I hardly left the house anyway—what did it matter if the roads iced over? I figured I’d just ride it out like I always did: in solitude.

I spent the rest of the day working and watching movies. The usual.

The next morning, I was wrenched from sleep by a sudden pounding on the front door.

I shot upright, disoriented, heart jackhammering in my chest. The knock came again—harder this time, insistent. I scrambled to throw on a pair of pants and stumbled toward the door, still bleary-eyed.

When I opened it, I was greeted by the last person I expected to see: my neighbor. An older woman. I’d only spoken to her once in passing and couldn’t for the life of me remember her name.

“Oh—hi,” I said awkwardly.

She looked sweaty and out of breath, strands of gray hair clinging to her forehead, like she’d been digging a ditch or running laps around the block.

“Hello,” she replied, her eyes flicking up and down me. I suddenly regretted not putting on a shirt.

“Sorry if I woke you,” she said, shifting anxiously on her feet. “I just wanted to make sure you’d be attending the town hall meeting tomorrow?”

Her voice had that sharp, urgent tremble older women sometimes get when they're worried—or hiding something.

“Uhhh... probably not,” I answered, already inching the door closed. “I usually work late” (lie), “but I’m stocked up for winter. I think I’ll be fine.”

She didn’t budge.

“I know you’re new to town,” she said, her voice rising. “So I think it’s *very* important you come!”

The way she said it—like she was issuing a warning instead of an invitation—made my skin crawl.

“Okay... maybe,” I muttered, and began to close the door.

But it didn’t shut.

I felt her foot wedge itself into the jamb.

“**Son.**” Her voice cracked like a whip. “Come to the meeting. It'll be a good way for the town to finally meet you. And we would *hate* for you to be underprepared.”

That last sentence came out cooler, more composed—too composed. Like she was reading from a script she’d been forced to memorize.

“Right. I can probably make it work,” I said quickly, just to get her to move.

She smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “Good. I’ll see you there.”

Then she pulled her foot back, and I shut the door.

I leaned against it for a long second, heart still thumping. What the hell was that?

One thing was certain: I still had no plans of going to that meeting.

Lying to get her off my porch didn’t bother me. Not even a little. But now—God, now I wish I’d listened. Because that meeting might’ve been the only thing that could’ve kept me out of this nightmare.

I went back to bed and decided to push off working that day as I had a weekly quota and would easily be able to make up for it the following day. But sleep didn’t come. I just laid there, staring at the ceiling, every creak in the floorboards making my pulse jump. I couldn’t shake the look in her eyes—like she knew something. Like the town knew something.

Eventually I gave up and dragged myself to the kitchen for coffee, half-hoping the caffeine would chase the paranoia out of my system. It didn’t.

The next day passed in a fog. I kept checking the clock. Not because I planned to go to the meeting, but because part of me wanted to see if anything strange would happen when it started. Like the sky would split open or something.

When 6:50 PM rolled around, I stood in my living room, lights off, staring out the window.

My street—usually quiet—was buzzing with movement. I saw silhouettes darting between houses, car doors slamming shut, boots crunching through snow. Everyone was leaving at once, heading toward the community center like they were all being pulled by the same invisible string.

Part of me felt like I should go—just to make sure everything was okay.

But the introvert in me won out quickly. I made a bowl of ramen, turned on the TV, and tried to shake off the unease. Fifteen minutes passed. That creeping sense of paranoia returned like a slow fog seeping under the door.

*What if I really was underprepared?*

I was from Florida, after all. It wasn’t exactly second nature to prep for harsh winters. For all I knew, something serious *was* coming—and I was too proud or too stupid to see it.

I know now the cold was the least of my worries.

I threw on my coat, against my better judgment, and stepped out into the night. The snow had picked up—thick, heavy flakes falling faster than seemed natural. Visibility dropped to almost nothing as I drove toward the small town hall building.

By the time I arrived, the streets were coated. I could barely find a spot to park—every curb, lot, and shoulder was packed with cars. The whole town must have been there. I parked as close as I could and stepped into snow that was already shin-deep. The air stung. The silence stung worse.

I climbed the stairs and grabbed the old front doors. Locked.

My stomach sank. I checked my watch. **7:15 PM.**

The letter came rushing back to me like a cold slap. **""Doors will close promptly at 7:10 PM.""**

I pounded on the door, hard as I could, but my hands were already going numb. I stumbled over to one of the large windows and peered inside, hoping someone might see me.

The meeting room was fully set. Rows and rows of chairs, all neatly arranged, waiting for the crowd I knew had come.

But no one was there. Not a single soul.

“They couldn’t have all left…” I muttered, turning to glance at the sea of parked cars around the building and spilling into the nearby lots. My breath fogged up the glass. The silence pressed in.

Then— Tires squealed behind me. Headlights cut through the snow like twin blades.

A small Honda Civic skidded to a halt at the base of the town hall steps. The door flung open before the engine even stopped, and a short man launched out of the car, his voice rising in panic.

**“NO!”** he shouted, bounding up the stairs.

He rushed past me, nearly slipping, and pounded both fists against the doors. **“Let me in! There’s still time!”** he cried out, desperation thick in his voice.

“Excuse me?” I called out, raising my voice over the wind.

He turned, startled.

“I don’t think anyone’s in there,” I said, nodding toward the window.

His face went pale. “There in there—the cowards!!!” he snapped, his eyes wide with fury and fear. “There’s still time! You can let me in!”

He pounded the door again, fists hammering like he could break through sheer will alone.

I stepped back, unnerved. “Is the snow gonna hit that hard?” I asked, confused and growing uneasy from his frantic tone.

He turned to me, eyes blazing.

**“The snow???”** His voice dropped an octave, trembling with something far colder than the air around us. **“What the hell are you on about, you idiot?”** He took a shaky breath, chest rising fast. **“He’s coming.”**",1,1749225936.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I haven't told you this, but I’ve been carrying the shape of you in the broken puzzle pieces of my heart since long before I had a name or face to attach them to.

Not the fantasy of you. Not an idea of you. Just...you.

The real you.

The woman who second-guesses herself. Who carries the weight of the world, even when she doesn’t have to. Who gives endlessly, not out of obligation, but because she truly wants to. Who doesn’t realize how beautiful and strong she is, because somewhere along the way, someone told her she was “too much.”

But the truth is, you’re exactly what you need to be.

Through everything in my life, the heartbreaks, the loss, the laughter and the healing, I’ve been learning how to love in a way that doesn’t shy away. A kind of love that doesn’t flinch. That doesn’t try to fix what isn’t broken. That stands firm. That holds space. That stays. And I’ve reached a point in my life where I know this for certain: I don’t want to love halfway. I want the silences. The storms. The raw honesty. The emotional intensity. I want you. Unfiltered.

I want the ordinary days. The morning coffee, you in the sunlight, half-smiling, hair a mess but beautiful. The quiet on the couch as we talk about our day. The adventures both large and small. The new memories. The laughter we both didn’t think we’d ever find again.

But I also want the heavy moments. The days when you feel like too much. Because to me you never will be. The days when the world takes more than it gives. Because to me, you’ll always be just the right amount to want. I want to hold you tight when you can’t hold yourself together. To be the arms you fall into when the day breaks you down. To be your comfort, because you are also mine. To know your cracks not so that I can fix them but so that I can learn the places that the light gets in.

This isn’t about rushing. I'm not telling you I love you. Not yet. But I can see that being a future for the two of us. I'm just simply telling you the truth of where I am right now: I’ve made space for someone who happens to be exactly like you. And the more I get to know you…the more pieces of you I find that they feel like they fit the missing puzzle pieces of me broken off through the years of life and loss.

So don’t worry about being perfect. To me, you already are. Don’t worry about saying the right thing. I just want you to be you. And if you ever feel that quiet pull, That little voice that wonders: “Could it be that he really sees me? Could he really handle all of my emotional intensity?” I hope you know the answer.

Yes.

I do.

I can.

And I’m here.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a wine stain remover depends on its formulation and how it interacts with the stain itself. Key considerations include the ingredients used, the application method, and the types of fabrics it can safely treat.

**Enzyme-Based Formula:**

Enzyme-based stain removers utilize enzymes to break down the complex molecules that make up wine stains. These enzymes specifically target the tannins and pigments found in red wine, breaking them down into smaller, more easily removable components. This approach is often gentler on fabrics compared to harsh chemical treatments.

**Hydrogen Peroxide Content:**

Hydrogen peroxide is a powerful oxidizing agent that can effectively bleach away wine stains. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide in a stain remover is a critical factor; to high a concentration can damage delicate fabrics, while too low a concentration may not be effective on stubborn stains. The ideal range is usually between 3% and 6% for most household stain removers.

**Surfactant Blend:**

Surfactants are compounds that reduce the surface tension of water, allowing the cleaning agent to penetrate the fabric fibers and lift the stain. A well-balanced surfactant blend ensures that the stain remover can effectively reach the wine particles embedded deep within the fabric. Different types of surfactants are used to target different types of stains and fabrics.

**pH Level:**

The pH level of a wine stain remover can impact its effectiveness and safety. A neutral or slightly acidic pH is generally preferred for most fabrics as it helps to lift the stain without causing discoloration or damage.Highly alkaline products can be more effective on certain stains but also carry a higher risk of damaging delicate materials.

**Spray nozzle Design:**

For spray-on stain removers, the design of the nozzle is crucial for controlled application.A good nozzle should allow for both a focused stream for targeted treatment and a wider spray for larger areas. This versatility ensures that the stain remover can be applied precisely where it's needed without oversaturation or wastage.

Key features to consider in a wine stain remover:

*   Enzyme-Based Formula
*   Hydrogen Peroxide Content
*   Surfactant blend
*   pH level
*   Spray Nozzle Design (for sprays)

## Core Benefits

Using a quality wine stain remover offers several significant benefits beyond simply removing unsightly stains. It protects your belongings, saves time and money, and provides peace of mind.

**Preservation of Fabrics:** A good wine stain remover prevents permanent discoloration and damage to your clothes, carpets, and upholstery. Prompt treatment with an effective formula can lift the stain wholly, restoring the fabric to its original condition and prolonging its lifespan.

**Time and Effort Savings:** Effective stain removers reduce the amount of scrubbing and repeated washing needed to remove wine stains. This saves you valuable time and effort, allowing you to address the issue quickly and efficiently without having to resort to professional cleaning services.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** Investing in a reliable wine stain remover can save you money in the long run.

## FAQs Section

**Can wine stain removers be used on all types of fabrics?**
Most wine stain removers are designed to be safe for a variety of fabrics, including cotton, linen, and synthetic materials. However, it's always best to test the product on an inconspicuous area first, especially when dealing with delicate fabrics like silk or wool. Check the product label for specific fabric recommendations and precautions.

**How quickly should I treat a wine stain for the best results?**
The sooner you treat a wine stain, the better the chance of complete removal. Fresh stains are easier to lift because the wine hasn't had time to deeply penetrate the fabric fibers. Ideally, treat the stain within minutes of it occurring. If immediate treatment isn't possible, blot the stain with a clean cloth or paper towel to absorb as much of the wine as possible untill you can apply the stain remover.

**Are wine stain removers safe for use around children and pets?**
While most wine stain removers are formulated to be relatively safe, it's essential to keep them out of reach of children and pets. Some formulas contain chemicals that can be harmful if ingested or come into contact with skin or eyes. Store stain removers in a secure location and follow the manufacturer's instructions for safe use and disposal. Consider using natural or non-toxic alternatives if you have concerns about chemical exposure.

**Do wine stain removers expire?**
Yes, most wine stain removers have a shelf life, typically indicated on the product packaging.Over time, the active ingredients in the formula may degrade, reducing its effectiveness. Check the expiration date before using the product, and discard any stain remover that is past its expiration date or shows signs of separation or discoloration.

Anyway we couldn't rent privately because neither one of us has good credit from getting into debt with bills, my bf being in and out of work with depression (he also has ADHD) and me occasionally impulse spending because of this we have CCJS (I'm trying to get his CCJ removed from his credit score through lawyers) and had no choice but to move here it was genuinely devastating because I didn't want to leave we were forced out, we also can't rent anywhere because he's a self employed gas engineer and plumber and I don't work.

The caravan we live in is extremely cramped we're sleeping in our front room, it's boiling hot even with the windows open if the temperatures go above 20 degrees it gets like a clay oven and we barely survived the winter due to powercuts back in January we didn't have power for 4 days and had to stay in a hotel with our cat. 

The site supervisor and the landlord rule this place with an iron fist back in January around about the time the powercuts began everyone who lives on the site was told they weren't allowed to have heaters in their caravans despite some of them not having any fucking heating at all and to just use oil radiators which don't do anything, they weren't allowed to use air fryers and to only use washing machines if absolutely necessary and not tumble dryers, one woman with a 15 month old son actually got lynched on the site WhatsApp group for using heaters, the landlord refuses to fix anything and is constantly moaning about how tenants are ""taking the piss"" costing him so much money in electric and all this shit even though electric is included in rent when you live in a caravan for fucks sake. The problems with the electrics didn't get sorted half the site is on a generator which means people are living off week to week fuel pretty much and have been told they can't use too much electric because there's only a once a week fuel delivery or some shit, the site supervisor told me 2 months ago we wouldn't be allowed to use our air conditioner until we're on prepayment credit meters which are meant to be installed any day now but the dates keep getting pushed back.

Atm it's summer and me and my boyfriend are having to hide that we are using a portable air conditioner I'm also hiding the fact I'm using a no plumbing counter top dishwasher because I can't wash up due to a trapped nerve in my leg (I'm obese) we built a wooden catio for our cat that's like a balcony type thing next to the caravan and we're putting the pipe out the side door in a box underneath a clothes airer with washed clothes or bedding to cover it up, the pipe is blowing hot air back in and because its bent out of shape and probably not getting decent enough ventilation it makes the aircon hot which makes the place hot its fucking pointless and idk what to do because I will not be told i can't use an air conditioner to try and make my home a little more bearable I'm not even joking this place gets so hot I get dizzy, I feel sick I can't even do housework, cook or dry my hair I have to wait for the sun to go down to do anything it's fucking torture and inhumane but still I try to make it a little bit better with the aircon and hold out hope I guess idk. This place is also noisy because its next to the motorways, some of the neighbours here are scum and someone tried starting a fight with me a month ago because he thought my cat went in his caravan, the previous neighbour we had was noisy as fuck and would shout and bang his van door at late hours of the night disturbing my sleep and causing anxiety, I'm pretty sure either him or the arsehole one caravan up from him smokes weed and it comes into our windows making the whole place smell like a coffee shop in Amsterdam, my cat loves it here but he keeps bringing in mice, rats, bunnies, shrews which is causing me a lot of stress he bought a rat in a few days ago and I still haven't found it 😭.

There's also the other shit of having to go outside to do my washing and my drying, it's  in the middle of nowhere and behind a gate but even this didn't stop 2 weirdos coming on to the site a few weeks ago and lurking around the site supervisor has had to get CCTV installed and bright lights which beam in our front room window and I've had to put up tshirts on my blackout curtains to block out the lights, condensation problems and damp, if we run out of gas from the LPG gas bottle outside we have to get another bottle or we don't have hot water, heating and we can't cook, the oven barely fucking cooks and I have to light it etc, the petrol fumes from the generator come through my window and it makes me feel sick as well.

My sister keeps telling me I bought this on myself and I let my credit get bad so I deserve to live in these conditions but I've never felt so fucking miserable and its making my BPD worse because my mood swings are worse and I'm unintentionally snapping at my bf over little things every day which is making me feel like a monster and not helping his depression, I'm under strain all the time, I'm on benefits and nobody who's on benefits is allowed to live here apparently my boyfriend works but I don't and a letter came for me last year from HMRC about some cold weather payment thing that i weren't eligible for and the site supervisor got nosy asking questions to my bf and that she would consider kicking us out if she thought we were on benefits since it's working tenants only which is a fucking terrifying thing to have hanging over my head because I can't control where I get letters sent to sometimes. Thing is the site supervisor and i imagine the landlord got funny about this letter but they lets their tenants speak to each other like SHIT and smoke weed and I'm like really?? Take a look around at who you're renting out to rather than looking at me and assuming the worst due to outdated demonised stereotypes of people who claim benefits ffs.

We're trying to save to move my boyfriend should have a clean credit score by August but atm I'm dreading the temperatures going up because it means my days become unbearably hot to the point it effects my mental health and I can't get anything done, I.e writing, housework so on even with the air conditioner going. Nobody in either of our families give a shit and they've washed their hands of us so to speak so we've been left here alone with fuck all help, my sister didn't even offer to have us come stay with her when we didn't have electricity in the winter, granted she came by with a power bank and that but only when I begged and it was literally a dire emergency because I was sat in the dark on my own and my boyfriend was at work.

Because the living conditions are grinding me down so much its making me lose focus on other things that are more important and need addressing I.e my weight, keeping the place clean, trying to focus on writing and getting to a point where its acceptable enough to charge people to write on Patreon (I write NSFW fan fictions and fem and male reader fics of certain characters from Trailer Park Boys on my blog) trying to focus on doing phone wallpapers that I can try and sell on etsy and make them even better. I feel like I'm constantly crushed by something going wrong here or even just trying to survive the day beating the heat and suffering from heat exhaustion like a fucking dog trapped in a car or something. Sorry for the long rant but yeah this seriously not helping my BPD even though  ironically my BPD is what landed me here lmao I've had enough and i wanna move but even that in itself is going to be like moving heaven and earth because of trying to either find a landlord who accepts benefits or a landlord who accepts someone who's self employed. I never imagined my living situation in my 30s would be the shit granted it could be worse I could be in prison or homeless but it wasn't that long ago where I lived somewhere where I was happy and at peace 😭. I just want to be able to use an air conditioner when it gets hot and not get told off for it or threatened with being made homeless its fucking barbaric.",1,1749225633.0,BorderlinePDisorder,1,1.0,False

My 4-7 FF per day habit contributed to bankruptcy, repossessed car, and all sorts of horrific life challenges. I don't blame the Tonic itself, even though the marketing is very problematic and little is known in society about addictive effects of kratom and extracts. It's never about the actual substance, but the underlying feelings and situations we run from in the present moment.

I am not scared of the detox journey. I have done many multi-day liquid fasts and have participated in plant medicine journeys over the years. I have done very challenging physical activities like backpacking as well. I am actually very strong willed, even thought the K will convince me otherwise.

I don't plan on trying to mitigate the effects of the detox with bunch of supps or medication, because I want to face it head-on. This was my own doing and I feel like I need to experience the consequences of that fully. Not in a masochistic way, but because I know this will forge me into a much better man and into a very beautiful life.

I do however, plan on combining my detox with a 5-day caloric liquid fast, which I have done many times before. This includes tons of water but also electrolytes, green juice, kombucha, tea, coffee and bone broth at night.

Kratom and especially extracts really affect the gut and I feel a gut-rebalancing fast like this will speed up the healing process.

Wondering if anybody has tried this before?

I am also considering starting a 75 Hard program at the same time too to keep my awareness on my body and not stuck in the mind all the time. That may be too much at once, but I do believe that sunshine, movement and nature helps tremendously in these situations.

1l4vuyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1l4vuyr/why_memes_matter_in_business_even_if_you_think/,Why Memes Matter in Business (Even If You Think They Don’t),"Let’s be real — when you’re deep in business operations, marketing, product, or sales, memes are probably the last thing on your mind.

But here’s why that mindset might be costing you.

1. Memes are more than just internet jokes. They’re a cultural language — a shared code that people use to connect, joke, and even express emotion. Friends speak in memes. Entire communities revolve around them. Ignore this language, and you’re missing out on a massive opportunity to relate to your audience.
2. Memes create emotional connections. They bypass logic and speak directly to how people *feel* — something traditional ads often fail to do. And when someone *feels* something, they're more likely to buy, share, or engage. That emotional “vibe alignment” can be the bridge between indifference and action.
3. Memes Drive Growth (Yes, Really)! Look at the crypto space — whole coins have gone viral and grown through nothing but meme power. We’ve seen it with meme currencies, and we’re seeing it with brands now too.

Examples of businesses crushing it with memes:

* [FLO Tracker on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@flotracker)
* [Revolut’s meme-driven video](https://www.tiktok.com/@revolutapp/video/7339487049365441825)
* [NordVPN’s fun meme-style promo](https://www.tiktok.com/@nordvpn/video/7255634721638583578)

These aren’t just flukes. These are strategy.

Memes Are a Tool — Use Them Smart  
You don’t need to be a designer or social media guru in this AI era. Sharing with you [vidpilot.ai](https://vidpilot.ai) that lets you make TikTok-style meme videos almost for free — the cost of a coffee, really.

**BUT — don’t rely on memes** ***alone***. They work best as part of a diverse content strategy. Mix them with informative posts, storytelling, product demos, and more.

# TL;DR

* Memes are a **language** of the internet.
* They create **emotional resonance** — which drives decisions.
* They’ve helped **brands and products grow** massively.
* They’re an **easy way to get traffic**, especially on platforms like TikTok.
* You can start making memes now — and yes, even serious businesses are doing it.

Let your brand have some fun. Memes aren’t just funny — they’re powerful.

I am recently divorced (1yr ago) and I downloaded Tinder. I matched with a guy (34m) and we hit it off right away. He's kind, smart & good looking and fun to talk with, also great in bed lol. I went back to the states, but I told him I'd be back in EU for work in June for work. 

Well, we keep texting and stay in touch. We have good communication and things remain passionate. I make plans with him to come to Paris for one day from Amsterdam I have off. I get a hotel room, train tickets and sexy lingerie. We make plans to spend the whole time together till I leave. 

Morning of my arrival, he messages me and says he's stayed up all night partying and he's dead tired but will absolutely be there waiting at our hotel for me. 

He was. He was there, he was charming and loveable and we fall into bed and spend a few hours together. Then he says he needs to go home for a bit, nap and grab some things, he'll bring back a bottle of wine and will be back in a few hours. That's fine, I could meet my friend for coffee and go for a walk. 

Well, apparently he goes home and passes the fuck out. I don't hear anything from him till 2am when he is frantically apologizing and offers to pay for the room. I see his messages early in the morning & respond that he still has a few hours to make it up to me. 

I'm just sad. Like, what the hell man? I've had a few benders, I get it but like... We had plans for an amazing night. It was all out there and I thought we both were excited? We all make mistakes, but  I feel confused & sad.

Each of them had a distinctly personal decorating perspective from shape, to texture, to color to line. And each style represented on screen, fleshed out our understanding of who they were as characters.

Admittedly, I've been out of the game for a time, but this week they had Carrie sipping from a Russian Imperial blue net with gold accents Lomonosov tea cup outside on a garden table when the rats raced by, while drinking from a souvenir thrift store mug at the kitchen table when Aiden stops by.

I distinctly remember that the china pattern she bought for her house with Big was the Hermes Guadalquiver pattern, bold red Spanish balcony curves on fine white china at a couple hundred bucks a pop. Where are those thousands of dollars worth of dishes today? Do they no longer evoke a favored memory? Are her dishes, like her shoes, just fashion? And now that they aren't quite as much in fashion, did Carrie sell them on Real Real? Or was this Russian porcelain pattern big in Manhattan back in the 1880's when her house was built? Favored by the Gilded Age gals perhaps? It feels like fashion, and not style at all. The choice doesn't feel motivated by anything personal, and the Carrie I thought I knew, was all about meaning and curation.

There used to be context behind the choices that told a story about a room's inhabitants and our main characters. Miranda's coffee table spoke volumes about what she valued. How her things didn't really mix with Steve's spoke another volume. Samantha's giant beds and use of red spoke to her lusty heart. Big's use of red which was a backlash from his beige days, also created a plot point all its own that was part of the story and acknowledged by the script.   


Charlotte's dinnerware pattern was feminine and restrained (and expensive) and the embodiment of her refined hopes for her first marriage, while at the same time being the personification of her husband's lack of any real involvement in their partnership outside of his alrighty then ability to consent to everything without participating in it (he couldn't even help pick that china pattern), but in the end, could pose in front of a China cabinet filled with the stuff for a magazine cover about an ideal marriage that was crumbling for Charlotte's sake.

But now? Carrie's life no longer feels curated, but like a walk through an Anthropologie store, with a bit of this and a bit of that, and no meaning behind the choices that lead to the stuff of our lives. Sure, she drags out the old poster that lived over her bed for a nod to nostalgia, and, I guess there is still some authenticity in that she is truly living in a house of shoes. Then go for it! Use shoes as decor.

I miss that level of masterful storytelling. Now it's just decor for fashion, and no longer for meaning. Full disclosure, I used to do set design, so perhaps this all hits different for me from a storytelling perspective. Any thoughts?",1,1749224828.0,Andjustlikethat,0,1.0,False

I make my coffee and smoke 

I enjoy the sunrise and read

I let the world fall around me. 

But there was a time long past 

Where I don't recognize who I was,

I would shove my nose full 

Of that cut Alberta snow 

Till my face was frostbitten 

With wild unloving eyes 

And a mangly root frame. 

A time where I dont remember,

Whether it was laced or not,

And a time where I didn't care.

Looking at the scars 

From picking out the bugs 

I could've sworn were real,

I was an abomination 

To creation and existence; 

These days I walk in the park 

Sit on the wooden bench 

And watch the leaves fall 

One by one,

Until the trees are empty 

I can't understand anymore 

How I let myself get so fast.

Then the boredom creeps in 

And I feel the need again 

To push my car harder,

To push my failing body,

To the edge of twilight. 

And In the darkest hour 

I will see him in the corner

With those thousand yard eyes

Picking and crawling in his skin 

Laughing at the endless void 
 
The sun will rise 

And the urges fade.

With a coffee and a smoke

I wonder if that was really me,

Or just a manifestation 

Of my deepest cravings.

I gave it a go, but ended up giving it to my nephew in college (and paying for his Connect subscription until he gets his degree).

I've ordered a ""rock paper pencil"" coating for my iPad Pro (with Apple Pencil) to see if I like that, but I have a nagging feeling it still won't be as good as a purpose-built device like the Remarkables.  The iPad Pro isn't an issue in my office lighting setup because I just crank up the backlighting to counter the glare.

So my question... would the Remarkable Paper Pro handle glare a LOT better than the r2 does?

Other than the glare -- which of course was a dealbreaker -- I did like the r2 a lot.

My energy was none existent. So, I went full mad scientist on myself and researched like crazy, tried a ton of stuff, and actually figured out how to fix my my brain again

(There are sections, but honestly, it all kinda works together.)

---
LEVEL 1: Nail these first

● SLEEP: 
- Dark room, cool temp, same bedtime. 

● HYDRATE: 
- Carry a water bottle. Drink it. All day. Headaches? Brain fog? Dehydration is a sneaky bastard.

●	SUNLIGHT: 
- 10-15 mins of morning sunlight (even through a window). Resets your internal clock. You can also get a light therapy lamp for dark winter days.

● MOVE YOUR DAMN BODY:
- Quick Walks: Clears the head, gets blood pumping.


Desk Stretches:
1.	Neck Tilts & Rotations
2.	Shoulder Rolls (Forward & Back): Release the hunch.
3.	Cat-Cow: Mobilize your spine.

*Seriously, 5 mins a few times a day makes a HUGE difference to blood flow and focus.*

● STAND UP MORE: 
- Sitting is brain-drain. Got a standing desk (better posture) and set timers to stand/stretch every few hours.

---
LEVEL 2: Things got really interesting for me.

- GET YOUR BLOOD CHECKED: Went to the doc, demanded comprehensive bloods. Low Vitamin D, B12, and borderline iron.

*Seriously, if you feel chronically shit, this is step one*

● FOOD INTOLERANCE:  
- Always had a weird stomach. Did a food intolerance test (get a decent one). Turns out, dairy and gluten were basically carpet-bombing my system with inflammation, making my brain feel like sh*t. 
If you gut is f*cked, your brain is fucked. 

● MOUTH BREATHING AT NIGHT: 
- Realized I was a mouth-breather in my sleep. Taped my mouth (sounds weird, look up ""mouth taping for sleep""). Sleep quality really improved

---
LEVEL 3: Fix your brainrot

● COLD SHOWERS: 
- Started with 30 secs of cold at the end of my normal shower. Now up to 2 mins full cold. The energy you get from that is INSANE.

● GREEN TEA + L-THEANINE > COFFEE:
- Swapped my jitter coffee for green tea (or matcha) with an L-Theanine supplement. Clean, calm, focused energy. No 3 PM crackhead crash.

●	""DOPAMINE DETOX"" SUNDAYS (OR WHATEVER DAY):
- One day a week, minimal tech, minimal stimulation. Just be bored. First few weeks were actual hell. Now? My brain actually enjoys normal, non-hyper-stimulated life again.

● WIM HOF BREATHING: 
- 30 deep belly inhales, full exhales. After last exhale, hold breath (empty lungs) 1-2 mins. Deep inhale, hold 15-30 secs. Instant energy & clarity. Repeat 2-3x for full effect if you have time.

● CHEW GUM (WHEN YOU NEED TO FOCUS): 
- Sounds fake, but it surprisingly works for studying/deep work. Supposedly increases blood flow to the brain.

--- 
LEVEL 4: Fix Your Attention Span

● GRAYSCALE YOUR PHONE: 
- Best. Hack. Ever. Makes TikTok/Insta look as appealing as watching your granny undress. Zero desire to scroll.

● UNFOLLOW them: 
- Kept actual friends + maybe 5 accounts that actually teach me something. The rest? UNFOLLOW.

● APP BLOCKERS: 
- Blocked Reddit, Youtube etc. during focused work blocks.

● NOTIFICATIONS: OFF (MOSTLY): 
- Your brain doesn't need a damn ping every 5 seconds.

---
LEVEL 5: Supplements & Systems

● WORK SMARTER, NOT HARDER: 
- Work in focused 90-minute blocks, then take a REAL 15-20 min break (walk, stretch, stare out the window, NO phone.

● MAGNESIUM GLYCINATE (BEFORE BED): 
- Helped with sleep quality and overall chillness.

● OMEGA-3s (FISH OIL/ALGAE OIL): 
- Brains are fatty. Feed 'em good fats.

---
THE MOST OVERLOOKED FIXES:

●	FIX. YOUR. POSTURE: 
- Seriously. Hunching kills blood flow to your brain and gives you neck ache. Get yourself a standing desk / Laptop stand + decent chair + consciously sitting/standing taller

● GET YOUR EYES CHECKED:
- Had a tiny vision issue I ignored. New glasses = headaches GONE by 90%. Less eye strain = less headache.

[2021 “Chocolate Noir II: A Long-Forgotten Stash” Craft Ripe Pu-erh](https://tea-side.com/chocolate-stash-ripe-puerh/)

The Backstory

I made this shou from old Thai tea trees, about 300 years old on average—the same material I always used for “Raspberry Pine.” The fermentation was completed on December 5, 2021, and the tea went off into aging, as it should.

All through 2022, I kept checking in on it, but wasn’t quite satisfied with its flavor. So I tucked it up higher on the warehouse shelves and kind of forgot about it. Then, during a recent inventory check, I found the tea and, obviously, brewed it straight away. 

I took some of the heads—and you know those need a bit of coaxing. The session started off alright, and I gradually increased the steeping time. At some point, I got distracted and completely forgot to pour off the tea, probably leaving it for thirty minutes, maybe even an hour...  When I finally remembered, I poured out this dark, thick oil infusion and cautiously took a sip. And wow. I haven't tasted a shou this rich, soft, and chocolatey-woody in a long time.

Tasting Notes

The dry tea aroma is classic shou—a bit salty and woody. Rinsed, it opens up with sweet, soft wood, chocolate, and a bit of raspberry jam. 

The taste is smooth, dense, and balanced: teak wood, robust chocolate body, and a pleasant coffee bitterness rounding off each sip.

This shou distinctly reminds me of ""Chocolate Noir,"" which I made later from different material and some slight tweaks in processing. Over its 3.5-year aging, the raspberry and berry nuances mostly faded, replaced by harmonious and rounded notes of chocolate and wood. I liked ""Noir"" so much and it sold out quickly that losing the berry notes didn't trouble me at all. But if your nose is sharp enough, you might still catch hints of berry jam in its fragrance.

The aftertaste is lovely: a chocolate candy from childhood, with the gentlest touch of coffee.
As for the effect, this shou pu-erh brings a calm, soft, grounding feeling—perfect for a peaceful morning session.

Brewing Advice

This tea unfolds gradually, it likes hot water and time. We didn’t separate the tea heads from the loose leaf: loose leaf brews faster, heads last through many steeps.

As usual, I use the softest, cleanest water I can find—around 10ppm. While ripe pu-erhs give you more freedom to experiment with water, this choice guarantees the described flavor profile.

In the photos, you see a porcelain houhin. For developing accurate descriptions and capturing tea aromas, I prefer heavier gaiwans, Japanese houhins, or shiboridashi. But for your own sessions, grab your favorite Yixing teapot and take your time between infusions. Let the tea fully bond with the clay. Trust me, it'll be amazing.

1l4vfe0,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1l4vfe0/dae_have_the_option_to_work_really_good_jobs_but/,"DAE have the option to work really ""good"" jobs but prefers ""low-level"" jobs?","To preface, I don't say ""low-level jobs"" like I think they don't require skills or are any easier than other jobs, I just mean it in terms of how society ranks them: as in they pay less and have less prestige.

I'm university educated and it has happened to me several times that I have landed prestigious jobs with solid pay, but I absolutely could not keep them and I was unhappy while working there. For example, I have worked at universities and for the government, I've worked as a social media manager, all kinds of stuff where the job was cushy and the pay good, the work easy, etc. Yet, I always would get kind of miserable. 

Then I've had jobs like making food and serving coffee and I really loved them. Work was fun and I really vibed with my coworkers (big BIG difference for me compared to the other jobs. I was well liked at most of my work places but I didn't feel a connection with the others really).

I just get insecure on this because I have university education and I'm approaching my 30's and I'm scared I should be building up my career more but I keep feeling unhappy at these more adult jobs and a lot happier just working 4 days a week in food. 

Anyone else? What should I do? Do I need to ""grow up?"" I have very low costs and don't plan on having children so I can't help but feel really content with where I am. I've never been a ""go getter"" with work and school but I did have good grades and I do work hard when I'm at work and I enjoy learning in my free-time, but I just like chill jobs but not so chill that I'm sitting in office doing nothing.

1l4vf0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1l4vf0m/mouth_vs_nasal_breathing_sleep_brain_bloodflow/,Mouth vs Nasal Breathing Sleep & brain bloodflow,"Im 3 weeks caffeine free..I did have 1 cup of matcha by choice cause I got some gelatin i wanted to consume but I just felt tired after so I won't be having any time soon.

Moving forward  Ive been really focused on getting better sleep and practicing mewing for tongue posture to improve other areas of health.
It's brought up many things to my awareness of how my posture is  horrible and Im weak i need exercise and on my phone too much.
Also I snore at night and ive caught myself mouth breathing. 
The fact I've still been tired throughout the day despite quitting caffeine im not putting it all on caffeines fault because now Im suspect it could be mouth breathing at night.
Since caffeine/coffee is a vasoconstrictor and reduces bloodflow to the brain, the research Im coming into is that mouth breathing also reduces the amount of oxygen to the brain.

As I go about my day I practice mewing but at the same time of keeping my mouth closed it is inadvertently getting me to nose breathing more often than I was previously which I presume. 
More nose breathing during the day also means more nose breathing at night which is vital because it's also filtering air as the mouth does not.


I got a good solid 8 hours of sleep last night wearing my invisalign as that seems to cause me to close my mouth but also wore a chin strap.  If I try mouth tape I know I'd rip it off so im not going to bother.
Im hoping now after a few more nights of sleep with nose breathing will improve daytime wakefulness and alertness.
I expect once I get my sleep dialed in with proper breathing the next step is to start exercising.  Im doing this methodically for lasting changes.

If anyone in here has conscious awareness and experience going from mouth to nose breathing would love to read your experiences. 

As coffee restricts bloodflow to the brain, mouth breathing also limits the amount of oxygen to the brain.  Im not counting sighing or intense mouth breathing from cardio as we are made to mouth breath but, snoring and mouth breathing during sleep can be detrimental to the brain long term I am finding out.

Now excuse me while I shut my mouth 😷🤐😂

The night before she was texting me saying we should get a bottle of wine next time were out. So the next day were texting normally, the weather is nice so i suggest we go for wine. Then she drops me with the fact that she’s having doubts and the  “i dont think i’ll love you in the future”. I guess she thought having doubts early was a bad sign. She seemed quite panicked and maybe her feelings boiled to the surface. To this day I still dont really understand her doubts. She said “i dont fancy you like the start” thats normal no? It felt like we were getting serious and she couldnt lean in. She said she was happy with me. But needed the feelings and the happiness. I was meant to go on a holiday with her family in 2 weeks. I bought myself a week and a half but she still wanted to end it. She seemed panicked and wanted out. She said it was nothing I did. It was both of our first relationships.

We exchanged the usual wordy texts over a week after the breakup but only one each. In her last one she said she still missed me and a lot of intimate details. And I didnt reply for 12 days after that off the advice of my protective friends. After the 12 days I went back and said that i respected her decision and that this was what she wanted. She got back to me the same day and didnt really acknowledge I said that and then engaged in some chat. She said it was weird not knowing what I was up to in my day to day because of No contact (bare in mind i never told her I was doing NC) and when i said it didnt have to be that way and that was a conversation for another time, she said it was “too soon”. I didnt push and left it at that. 2 weeks go by and she texts me when shes out having wine, saying she had to tell me about this person she saw and congratulations on my golf win (which was on my insta story the day before). I didnt respond for 2 days and went back with a light and polite response. She got back to me 5 mins later with a reply, maybe a bit embarrassed she reached out at all. I didnt reply to her last message. Its been 3 weeks and no words from her.

I don’t think what she said after in manipulating or anything nasty, it was her first relationship and breakup too. Theres a lot she said during the breakup which contradicts her confusion after. Like if you didnt want to be with me, why are you reaching out? She knows how i feel about her. She broke it off. All i want to do is ask her for a coffee to see where she’s at. But I have a lot of fear. Any advice?",1,1749224003.0,Breakupadvice,0,1.0,False

She laughs.,"I don't know if this is the right place to ask, I'm sorry if it's not. Throwaway because wtf. Also I apologise if some of these words are badly picked - I am not a native English speaker and the polite words for talking about racial issues seem different here than in many English-speaking countries.

I (33f) live with my mom (58f) alone because of my various mental issues worsening and taking a toll on my mental faculties. It was my mom's birthday recently, so her siblings (50sf and 50sm) decided to come on a surprise visit yesterday. We're all mix-white-mix-inuit with my mom's generation being pretty 50-50, while I'm more 25-75, so they have far stronger native features than I do, with my mom looking almost entirely Inuit, my aunt looking almost entirely white, and my uncle having a good visual mix. This is relevant.

For the visit my uncle brought his wife of about 4 years (50sf) who's from South-East Asia, where she's really successful. They met on a dating app some years ago and she seemed to like that my uncle is both a hardworking carpenter with his own business, and a big joker of a person even at his age. He likes to bring energy to the room and make people laugh. This hasn't been a problem before. They tend to bring a lot of fun energy to the table at family gatherings as they back and fourth, so it's not like he talks over her with his attempts to be funny.

Anyway everyone agreed to get together again today; so my mom and her youngest sister went to buy more groceries. My uncle and his wife showed up faster then expected though, so I put some coffee over and decided to use my few social spoons for the day to keep them company while we waited. I'm still in a bit of a brainfog and slow on reactions after a rough week, but they're family, and I wanted them to feel welcome even if I wasn't all there.

At some point the topic of our side of the family having Inuit roots came up and my uncle mentions our ""Asian heritage"" that he can tell from how we're all ""a bit sharp-eyed"", upon which he PULLS ON THE CORNER OF HIS EYES in that really old, stereotypically racist way. His wife, who's 100% Asian starts laughing in response. Normally I'm good at detecting an uncomfortable laugh but I really, honestly couldn't tell in this case - especially as they both continued the conversation like nothing happened.

I'm not proud to say that it gobsmacked me too much in the moment to react immediately. I completely blue-screened while they continued their chat about her home in South-East Asia and the house he helped them build. Later he used a rather rude word in my native language to describe middle-eastern and some Asian people, the kind that people ""in the community"" use for themselves but people outside it really aren't supposed to, and I politely asked that we don't use that word. I don't even think he registered it while he was going on gushing about his wife's job. He also used some unfortunate words to talk about a middle-eastern driver they had an encounter with on the road.

I finally said ""ok, I don't wanna listen to this"" and shut myself in my room. But I can hear them out there joking and laughing with each other like nothing happened. I'm not even sure they noticed I left.

I'm shut up in my room now, rather overwhelmed. Mom says we'll talk once they leave, that her brother is an idiot that doesn't know what he's saying half the time but seems fine with me refusing to socialize with my uncle after that. I'm flabbergasted though, and unsure what to make of this. But I'm also aware that I'm the most white-looking person in the room, and don't know if I really have a right to be upset if the actually fully Asian person in the room, seems to think his antics are hilarious. Maybe it's because of the asian-inuit historical debate making them feel like they can make these jokes? Maybe I'm worse at detecting discomfort than I thought? Maybe I'm just the dumb ignorant white person in the room? AIO? I feel like I'm in a twilight episode. I can hear them talk about how terrible discrimination is outside my door, like my uncle didn't just pull on his eyes like a racist cartoon. Does anyone know how to handle this sort of situation? Any advice is appreciated, I have no idea what to make of all this and this brainfog sure isn't helping.",3,1749223882.0,AmIOverreacting,11,0.8,False

## FAQs Section

**Are shaped candles safe to burn, considering their unique shapes?**
yes, shaped candles are generally safe to burn as long as they are made with high-quality materials and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. It’s important to ensure that the candle is placed on a heat-resistant surface,away from flammable materials,and that the wick is trimmed to prevent excessive smoking or dripping. Properly designed shaped candles are tested to ensure safe and even burning,minimizing the risk of accidents.

**how do I prevent shaped candles from dripping or tunneling?**
To prevent dripping or tunneling, it's crucial to burn the candle long enough for the entire surface to melt evenly during the first few burns. This creates a ""memory ring"" that helps the candle burn uniformly in subsequent uses. trimming the wick to about 1/4 inch before each burn can also prevent excessive smoking and dripping. If tunneling dose occur, you can try wrapping the candle in foil (leaving the top open) to help the outer edges melt and catch up with the centre.

**Can shaped candles be used for aromatherapy?**
Yes, many shaped candles are infused with essential oils and fragrance compounds that can provide aromatherapy benefits. Look for candles that specifically state they contain natural essential oils, as these are more likely to offer therapeutic effects. Different scents can promote relaxation, energize the mind, or improve mood, depending on the essential oils used. Always check the ingredient list to ensure the candle contains pure essential oils if you are primarily seeking aromatherapy benefits.

25M, heart pure a child yet mind bruised like intellectuals 

Overthinker, coffee addict, occasionally funny when sleep-deprived

Lover of deep conversations, cozy silences, and finding beauty in mundane things

About you?

You don’t need to have it all figured out (actually, it’s better if you don’t)

You miss late-night talks that feel like therapy

You believe in sincerity over aesthetics

You’d rather swap weird confessions, music, book ideas, or even favorite comfort foods than “wyd” texts


Maybe we’ll bond over burnt cookies, unfinished books, or the absurdity of adulthood. Maybe we’ll create our own space to talk about everything and nothing. Maybe we’ll send each other songs that feel like home.

1l4v7rf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1l4v7rf/i_made_it_to_10_days_sober/,I made it to 10 days sober!!,"This is huge for me. My last record of sobriety was 9 days. I just officially beat my personal best since developing this nasty habit. 

There were 3 occasions I knew I had to say no to drinking: 

•Trivia night at the pub. My friend hosts trivia night as a gig at this Irish themed pub. Every bone in my body wanted an Irish coffee (one of my go-to cocktails). Instead, however, I smoked a joint and had an alcohol free Guinness beer! Bartender even let me keep the can that said 0%! 

•The weekend. This was one of my biggest triggers. When the weekend approached, I had only been sober for 3 days. I ALMOST said yes, but my boyfriend sat me down, and asked me: Is this what YOU want or what YOUR ADDICTION wants? I didn’t end up getting any alcohol, and we went paddle boarding! 

•Seeing an abundance of vodka at my other friend’s house. Usually her and I would leisurely drink together, as she didn’t understand the full magnitude of my habit. She didn’t actually know how much I was really drinking. But I didn’t even acknowledge the existence of the vodka on the table to her. We went to the dispensary after getting her stuff in storage and went exploring instead! 

Now a new challenge is upon me: weekend 2. However, it’ll be easier than last weekend. Why? Because my waist is looking AMAZING with this newfound sobriety. I can eat WHATEVER I WANT and my waistline looks amazing. When I drank it felt like the consequences of me eating the night before bled into the next day. My skin looks so tight and toned, and the backs of my thighs have never looked this good. I had A LOT of water weight from drinking, and seeing that all just drop off my body in a matter of weeks has been such an incredible experience. Suddenly my clothes fit better, I’m less bloated, and I just feel like myself again. Except for the cravings, but I won’t give in!! IWNDWYT!",36,1749223537.0,stopdrinking,6,1.0,False
1l4v7om,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l4v7om,"Four Scents, One Nose, and Zero Chill","I tested four popular men's fragrances—some hyped, some forgotten, all sprayed in the name of curiosity (and maybe a little judgment). With a little money burning a hole in my pocket, I was ready to fall in love. Here’s how they stacked up, from the one I actually bought to the one I forgot I even tried.

# Polo Red Eau de Toilette: The One That Earned a Second Date

Of the four scents I tried, Polo Red Eau de Toilette was the one I liked best. Which is funny, because when I first sprayed it, I wasn’t impressed. It came off flat and a little blah—nothing offensive, but nothing exciting either. But after about 30 minutes, it settled into something warm, smooth, and actually pretty likable.

The cranberry note stands out in a good way—not fresh or juicy, but richer and deeper, like a dried cranberry that’s been hanging out with some oak and flattering lighting. The citrus adds just enough brightness to keep things from getting too heavy, while the wood and coffee notes bring in a low-key richness. The coffee note doesn’t make it smell like you just left Starbucks, but it adds a cozy, roasted warmth in the background. You’ll barely notice it, but it plays peek-a-boo—just enough to keep things interesting.

The amber is what ties it all together and gives the scent that soft, slightly luxurious feel. What I appreciated most was the balance—no single note takes over, and everything feels well-blended and easy to wear.

It lasted about six hours on my skin, which made it the best performer out of the four I tested. I liked it enough to buy a full bottle (found it on sale for $32 at The Perfume Spot). If it had cost much more than that, I probably would’ve passed—but at that price, it was a nice addition to my collection. Besides, I didn’t have anything in a red bottle.

***Rating: 8/10***

A laid-back, easygoing scent that gets better with time. Balanced, quietly confident, and a solid value if you catch it on sale.

# Coach for Men: Here for a Good Time, Not a Long Time

Of the four fragrances I tested, Coach for Men kept me guessing the most. I liked it, then I didn’t, then I sort of did again. It’s a bit of a rollercoaster—but not the kind that ends in regret. Just the kind that makes you think, “Okay, maybe one more ride, but with full sprays next time.” It was the most tolerable of the Coach lineup I’ve tried—not a major accomplishment, considering Coach Blue and Coach Green were just average scents with weak longevity.

Classified as a woody aromatic, it’s masculine without being douchey—like it knows what cologne is, but doesn’t spray it in a gym locker room. The pear note is unique—it softens things and gives it a smooth, almost flat feel. Then the bergamot and kumquat crash the party with a sharp citrusy hit that cuts through the calm. The lavender adds a little polish, but not in a way that makes it smell like a bar of hotel soap.

I never thought I’d be into leather notes, but I’m starting to appreciate them. Here, the leather is smooth and grown-up, adding some subtle depth and just enough edge. It’s masculine in a way that feels confident but not try-hard. There’s also ambergris in the mix, supposedly—but honestly, I don’t even know what that smells like. If it’s doing something, good for it.

It lasted about six hours on my skin, then pulled a complete disappearing act—even on my clothes. Would I buy it? Maybe if the price is right. It’s inoffensive, wearable, and better than I expected from Coach, but still not something I’d go out of my way for. It’s a safe scent—clean, masculine, a little citrusy, a little leathery—but not all that distinctive. Sort of like a Coach handbag—it’s fine, but it’s not a Chanel.

***Rating: 7/10***

Solid, middle-of-the-road, and completely unmemorable in the best possible way. Like cologne for someone who doesn’t really wear cologne—but wants to try.

# Versace Pour Homme: Inoffensive, Unmemorable, Unbothered

Of the four fragrances I tested, this one left the faintest impression—if you can even call it that. I don’t know what the big whoptido is about. It came and went so fast I barely got to form an opinion. No wow factor on the opening, no payoff in the drydown. It just… existed.

And honestly, based on the scent notes and the fact that it’s an aromatic fougère, I should have liked it. But it opens too sharp for me—heavy on the lemon and bergamot—and the neroli (my most hated note) does nothing to help. I kept waiting for the rose, amber, or tonka bean to come in and smooth things out, but they never really showed up. Just a lot of bright citrus and a hint of disappointment.

People like to compare this to Chanel Allure Homme Sport, but I don’t get that at all. Where Chanel feels polished and layered, this feels like something you'd get handed in a gift set alongside a deodorant stick and a washcloth. It’s giving “first cologne you ever wore to a job interview in college.”

I know I’ll get hate for this, but right now it feels like cologne for people who aren’t totally sure they want to wear cologne. Longevity? Average. Maybe four hours, if I’m being generous. I’ll give it one more shot with full sprays, just to be fair. I want to like it—but so far, I don’t.

***Rating: 5/10***

Not offensive, not interesting. Just floating somewhere in the middle of the fragrance universe doing absolutely nothing.

# Polo Black Eau de Toilette: It Looked Better in the Bottle

Of the four I tested, this is the one I almost forgot I tried—which probably says more than the fragrance itself. I expected something warm, woodsy, maybe a little fruity. I was especially curious about the mango note. But if there’s mango in here, it’s in the witness protection program. What I got was mostly tangerine, tonka, and woods. Not terrible, just… forgettable.

Sillage? Barely there. Longevity? Also barely there. It felt like one of those colognes that disappears the moment you start to like it—which in this case, never really happened. I wanted to like this one because the black bottle would match my wardrobe (i.e., my 1,000 black T-shirts and polos). And no, none of my polo shirts have the little horse on them. They’re just black. Like my coffee. And now, my fragrance regret.

Would I try it again? Sure, with a few more sprays—mostly to see if it shows up to work this time. At this point, the salespeople at Ulta probably think I’m a vagrant coming in for free fragrance hits, which is only half true.

***Rating: 5/10***

I’m not mad at it… I just don’t remember it. Which might be worse.

# Final Thoughts

So, what do you think—did I nail it, totally miss the mark, or just offend your signature scent? Let’s hear it. Maybe you love the one I forgot existed. Maybe I disrespected your ride-or-die fragrance. Maybe you also bought Polo Red because it was $32 and came in a cool bottle. No judgment (okay, maybe a little).

1l4v7js,https://i.redd.it/kz2y80m9qb5f1.png,[17 YOE] A Tale of Two Resumes and how I landed numerous Interviews & Offers- Part 3/3," 

**This is the final part of my success story journey. Thanks to everyone who helped and guided me in this. I have included links to my previous posts for reference:**

[**Part 1 of my success story.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/1l3i8yi/17_yoe_a_tale_of_two_resumes_and_how_i_landed/)

[**Part 2 of my success story.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/1l3yfsa/17_yoe_a_tale_of_two_resumes_and_how_i_landed/)

[**Resume Template**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11OEJNjhZzM40BeBKns3voQ3vbcMP9e4J/view?usp=drive_link)



**The process & some tips:**

I stuck to a routine. I got off work @ 3:30pm. I would get home and spend 2 solid hours just applying for jobs. At weekends, I would spend at least 4-6 hours doing the same or doing small courses on LinkedIn Learning, mostly when my daughter was asleep.

I must have applied for close to 750+ jobs. One callback was from ZipRecruiter; the rest were from LinkedIn. I had recruiters reach out to me (unsolicited) mostly from LinkedIn and a few from Indeed. The rest of the job search engines I used like Adecco, Yoh, DICE (excellent for IT/Software) to name a few are trash especially for a Mechanical Engineer. I was toggling between so many sites that sometimes I would go to apply for a job, and it would say you already applied. Eventually I stuck with just LinkedIn.

**Tips on LinkedIn Job Search:**

I created numerous job alerts on LinkedIn. Initially I searched for “Mechanical Engineer” or “Design Engineer” or “Engineering Manager”. The problem is not all job postings use the correct job title. Some titles like project engineer or reliability engineer or manufacturing engineer were also relevant to me. So, I switched to generic job titles. Here are the ones I used: Engineer, Engineering Manager, Project Manager & Project Management. It does bring up an insane number of results but that’s ok. I rather not miss out on a potential job.

Also, I only used 3 filters: Full-time (Job Type), Any Time (Date Posted) & Most Recent (Sort By). Initially I had also used other filter like Industry, Job Function, Title, Salary & Benefits. These are useless imo. For example: Engineering Manager with Full-time, date posted and most recent pulls up 4686 jobs at this moment. If I check salary as 100K+ it drops results to 767.

Finally, I have attached an image of what LinkedIn sends to a recruiter when you click “easy apply”. One of the recruiters forwarded it to me when she reached out.



**Few Interview Tips that worked for me:**

1.)   Relax. It’s not the end of the world. Keep a bottle of water or a cup of coffee with you. When you feel nervous or stuck, sit back & take a sip. You will be alright.

2.)   Don’t try to BS your way through. Some of the interviewers might be SMEs. Not worth it. Just say “I don’t know”. Most of them understand and expect that.

3.)   Sometimes the interviewers throw out words that they are used to but not you. Ask them to clarify the question and if you don’t know the answer refer to point 2.

4.)   I pretend like I am having a conversation with my co-workers or friends. Makes me less tense during the interview. After you have done a few, you will know what the answer to the question is and be more relaxed.

5.)   You are a salesman selling yourself. I like to think of myself as a story-telling salesman. Pick a scenario from your current job and tell them a story. Soon, you will become a master storyteller. Remember, you are the SME at your current job. So go sell yourself.

6.)   Most interviews will NOT go your way. The job is not a fit for you sometimes. Some interviewers are clueless or plain jackasses. Don’t lose confidence. Next one just might be your golden ticket.

7.)   One question I love answering is “Why are you the best person for this job?”. I always respond with “I can give you a million typical reasons, but you don’t want that. We are doing this interview today because you feel I might be the best person for the job just as I feel you might be the best company to work for.“ (Yep, I practiced that one a lot lol.)

 

**The interviews & the offers (so far):**

Most of the callbacks stopped at the initial phone screen, but a good number made it past. If I got past the phone screen, I almost always made it to the final round. Almost always the interviews consisted of 3 rounds:

1.)   Initial Phone Screen.

2.)   Hiring Manager.

3.)   Final round with a panel or VP or CEO

4.)   Site visit (Very rare – 3 of the numerous interviews I attended. Got offer from one).

Sometimes I have had two or even three rounds on the same day. Mondays are my days off, so I like scheduling them on that day. My calendar was so full of interviews that I lost track of whom the next zoom/teams call was with. It gets monotonous, the questions are the same or very similar and I felt like a broken tape, repeating the same things multiple times a day to various people. Frankly I was getting burnt out.

Finally, I stuck gold on the week of May 12^(th). I was interviewed by the VP of operations and HR manager (Company A) on May 9^(th,) and they scheduled me for an interview with the CEO on May 12^(th). At the end of the team’s call, he invited me to visit them onsite, which took place on May 15^(th). They flew me down to their site, booked a hotel, car and I left there @ noon with an offer for 142k / year (45k over my current salary).

I was ecstatic. My join date was June 9. I sat down over the weekend, went over all the details, the salary, benefits, looked over the city I would be moving to, and I was disappointed. The salary did not meet the cost of living in the city. The cost of an average home in a 30-mile radius was close to a million dollars. The benefits were abysmal, only 65% health coverage and only for employees. Not even an option to buy health insurance for the family. I pondered over it for the rest of the week and on May 20^(th), I sent them an email declining the offer.

 I realized my mistake; I had not done my homework right. So, I made another simple plan:

1.)   I investigated the companies on Glassdoor to get a rough idea of the companies.

2.)   I was also careful of what locations I would accept an offer for. The critical criteria were a cleaner environment, a place with access to excellent healthcare and finally a good education system.

3.)   I went through all the jobs I was waiting on offers for and had interviews scheduled and wrote down the expected pay after looking over the cost of living where they were located, eliminating ones that didn’t meet the criteria from point 2.

4.)   I called back the recruiters and the HR personnel and asked them for a definite salary range and cancelled interviews where the pay and benefits did not make sense.

In the meantime, I had been waiting for 3 more offers. The one I was super confident about was Company D, which ghosted me. Pretty lame imo (3 Interviews + Site Visit). Just tell me I didn’t get the job and let’s move on. On the week of the 23^(rd), HR from Company B emailed me and said they are still going through candidates.

Company C threw me a curveball. I had done my final interview with them on May 5^(th) for the Sr. Mechanical Engineer position. I got a text message from one of the final interviewers on May 23^(rd), she understood I was due for my results, but the panel felt my skillset would be better suited for a higher position (Engineering Manager) and wanted to know if I was interested in interviewing for it next week. I interviewed with them on May 27^(th) from 11-11:40 am and got the offer for the Manager position at 12:45 pm on the same day. 150K with insane benefits.

Yesterday, I got an offer from Company B, 150K in Utah. I will be going over the two offers this weekend and will make a temporary decision for now while I wait for decisions from other companies as well as finishing all the interviews I have scheduled so far.

 

Company A (California) – 142K + Poor Benefits – DECLINED

Company B (Utah) – 150K + Good Benefits – In Consideration (July 7^(th))

Company C (California) – 150K + Excellent Benefits – In Consideration (June 30^(th))

(So far, I am leaning heavily on Company C especially for the growth prospects & the excellent benefits.)

 

Thanks for reading my success story. Hope it helped. Good luck with your job search.

I'm at that awkward phase as a Killer (like a teenager with a squeaky voice) where I'm no longer new, but also not _good_ yet.  I get the fundamentals and I can usually beat average survivors.

But I'm just not skilled enough to chase down the good ones.

So for all the survivors out there who're bored silly and who tbag / point at me early on, wanting me to chase 'em for 10-15-ish minutes on hellish loops that'll make me wanna bite chunks out of my controller and/or my coffee table...

...enjoy watching from the fringes as I chase down your pals.

I'll walk away with 1-2 kills, and my blood pressure levels will thank me for it.  You'll escape scott free, without me even remotely trying to chase you down.

If that sounds like a win-win scenario, more power to you.  That's all for me.

1l4uxi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PositiveTI/comments/1l4uxi6/constant_chatter/,Constant chatter,"My voice often says things like ""You're going to hate yourself."" Also it constantly tells me stuff like my mom set me up, my aunt wants me dead. I'm going to prison soon and I was set up. The crazy part is about 3 years ago I was driving for Lyft and was sober at the time. One day I picked up this girl and we were driving and that's the last thing I remember. I blacked out. 6 hours later I came to walking down the street in the middle of the hood hood. (Whiteboy by the way) It was in February so it was freezing cold out. I was walking around with a t-shirt on with no coat and no recollection of where my car was, where my wallet was, my phone was gone, my keys. I had no idea where I was, how I got there and where my stuff was. It was about 3:00 a.m. I called my mom freaking out and asking her to come get me. She came and got me and I went to bed. That morning me and my mom drove around looking for my car. We couldn't find it anywhere. Just then  My mom's phone starts ringing. It's a sheriff deputy saying that they found my car right near downtown in a club parking lot. We arrived there in the sheriff was waiting. My car was there, all the windows were open, my keys were in there, my wallet & my phone was still there! It's crazy because the voices would say before that happened something about ""deputy sheriff's blah blah blah... Investigation... I'm being investigated and I'm being thrown in prison soon blah blah blah"" And then that happened. I was completely blown away and scared to death. Because either these voices know beforehand what's going to happen in your life coming up or this whole gang stalking thing is real. I mean it is real, I am convinced. But when it was at its worst I was on methamphetamines so I expected it. But not clean and sober. Even though the voices never go away. Sober or not sober. They have predicted things that were spot on. That's the scary part. I'm still torn between it being Satan, demons, angels or God. I'm pretty sure it's not God though because it is a very mean voice. It's deep at times but at other times it sounds like a teenager yelling at me. Mind boggling. But the weird part is when I was using drugs, they would always tell me to go to rehab and they would give me advice on how to better my life. But then when I started bettering my life, they would have comments to say about every little thing I did or thought. I could see how people lose their minds during this phase. I used to tape record everywhere I went. On my phone. I still have all the files. The weirdest part is that I have my mom and my aunt and my sister talking about just how they want me dead basically in so many words. Not completely coming out and saying that but insinuating stuff. I go back and listen to the past recordings and I'm just like ""were they possessed or something?"" Am I in some kind of alternate reality? Purgatory perhaps? I try not to overthink things but the worst tape recording is when I went to the hospital for a breathing treatment. My mom brought me and I tape recorded the whole thing and nobody knew it was recording. I have the nurses basically saying how they know every little dirty secret of mine and that basically they were poisoning me that day. They were expecting me because my mom insisted that we go to this out of the way hospital. The whole thing was messed up but it was almost like I was drugged. And they talk about something about Xanax. I literally don't remember most of the whole experience. You can hear me in the recording fading in and out. And then you could hear them doing something to me when I was out. And they kept referring to what they were going to inject me with as ""the that."" And literally laughing about it the whole time like it was a big joke. The worst part about it all is that who am I going to go to about the situation? I can't go to my mom obviously. When I bring up the fact that I have all these recordings she literally turns into another person and starts freaking out. And demanding that I delete them. I won't delete them! I will take them to my grave! I was really considering just posting them on Facebook and other social media sites but I really don't want to ruin reputations unless I'm 100% positive. Which I had a nurse friend of mine listen to the recording and she was blown away by what they did to me and how they acted. They gave me nine x-rays that day because they kept saying ""oops you have to move over another inch."" Nine x-rays! Chest x-rays. Then they were desperate to find a vein. Because I have small veins so when they couldn't get a needle initially they literally made me go get an ultrasound on my arm just so that they can find a vein. They were adamant about finding a vein. Mind you I was there for a literal breathing treatment! It's such a f***** up experience. Then after they finally find a vein the nurse goes ""we just seek them out and find them and then we let natural selection do its job "" I mean WTF?!?! For a long time I wanted revenge. I'm not even going to talk about that on here but if anything I will get my revenge by just smearing all these recordings everywhere like they smeared my name through the mud. For so many years. That's why I say it's a good thing that you guys record a lot of experiences, especially at hospitals. Some may say it's a bad idea but I say 100% do it. If you truly are a real T.I. because there is some really crazy things going on out here in this world that most don't even know exist. They also gave me three different COVID swabs but the funny part is I got COVID a couple days after I left that hospital. For the second time in like 2 weeks. Nobody can tell me that there isn't a program going on. A program in which the government or whoever is involved thanks they can play God and pick and choose who lives or dies. 7 years ago I got a call on my phone out of nowhere and it was the FBI. They told me they needed to meet me at a coffee shop. So I went there. There were three FBI agents sitting around the table with a folder in their hands. During the conversation they told me about how they know my dark web dealings with drugs and other stuff. After the conversation they confiscated my phone. 3 weeks later I got it back in the mail in an envelope with no explanation. So I thought I was off the hook. But that is exactly when the voices and everything else started happening to me. So what do you all think of that? Please give me some insight. And God bless all of you. We were chosen for a reason. Whatever that may be, sinister or not, I'd love some opinions! Thx",2,1749222840.0,PositiveTI,1,0.75,False

Not here for dry convos or ghosting,just looking for a real, long-term vibe. Deep talks, dumb memes, music swaps, late-night voice notes,all of it.
I’m into classic movies, poetry writing, emotional story games, photography, and learning languages (Japanese & German). I love riding my bike in the mountains and chasing quiet sunrises. I also run a marketing agency and work with an NGO & school, so life’s wild but meaningful.
If you’re into coffee-over-clubs and good convos, say hi. Just tell me your age & gender.
Let’s make something cool out of this.

1l4uw7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LloydCompanies/comments/1l4uw7f/bigger_scope_of_work_brings_lloyd_construction/,Bigger Scope Of Work Brings Lloyd Construction Into Multiple New States,"A block of downtown Des Moines has been transformed into a mixed-use redevelopment with the opening of [The Deco](https://www.thedecolofts.com/) \-- a new development from Sioux Falls-based Lloyd Companies.

""It's a really nice project,"" said [Mike Dill](https://lloydcompanies.com/team-member/mike-dill/), executive vice president for [Lloyd Construction](https://lloydcompanies.com/commercial-construction/), which built the five-story project -- including 81 studio, one and two-bedroom lofts.  
""It's built on a footprint the size of a postage stamp, but the quality is amazing.""

The project is one of several taking Lloyd Construction outside of its home base in South Dakota, as the company landed a wide range of work in multiple states.

In Des Moines, ""it wasn't quite a blank slate to start,"" Dill said. ""There was a retaining wall, so we had some demolition a site work to get the pad ready, plus we're right across from a heavily utilized downtown fire station, so there were accommodations made for traffic along with security of the site.""  
  
Now that residents are moving in, ""reactions have been fantastic,"" property manager Joe Pahlka said. ""Everyone who has toured the Deco has been truly impressed by the craftsmanship and the thoughtful layout. Now that our doors are officially open and construction is complete, we expect leasing activity to become even busier.""

The striking aesthetic sets the property apart, with a brick exterior, upgraded apartments and concierge-style resident service, he added.

The building includes a community room, 24-hour fitness center, guest suite and second-floor rooftop patio.  
""While it's not a historic district, just being in downtown Des Moines involves some design standards that were similar to one, so there were some unique considerations,"" Dill said.

The Des Moines project is one of several bringing Lloyd Construction into new markets this summer.

A groundbreaking is planning this summer in Arkansas for a multiphase townhome-style project as well as income-qualified housing.

""The metro area we're working in is similar to Des Moines, with multiple contiguous communities,"" said [Jerry Fromm](https://lloydcompanies.com/team-member/jerry-fromm/), president of Lloyd Construction. ""As we've learned more about the market, there are a lot of similarities in how we do business and it seems like a good fit.""

Lloyd Construction also is starting work on a 100,000-square-foot industrial facility buildout in Kentucky as well as multiple hotel projects.

A Homewood Suites is starting construction in New York in mid-June and other hotels projects in Virginia and Wyoming are expected to begin in the coming months.

""We reached out to some of our industry contacts, threw our hat in the ring and they liked what we could bring to the table,"" Fromm said.

""In many cases, we're supporting pre-construction work on these projects from Sioux Falls while also doing a significant amount of traveling. We have some superintendents relocating for projects and we're doing hiring locally as well.""

Closer to home, Lloyd Construction is wrapping up work in downtown Sioux Falls this summer on Jacobson Plaza and the [River Greenway](https://lloydcompanies.com/case-study/river-greenway-at-the-steel-district/), as well as the buildout of Jack Rose Social Club at [The Steel District](https://www.thesteeldistrict.com/). Work continues on apartment communities including [The Current](https://residepropertymanagement.com/property/the-current/) at Dawley Farm Village and Harvest Ridge townhomes in southwest Sioux Falls.  
  
In Rapid City, Lloyd Construction just finished its largest project ever in the city, with the 10-story mixed-used project [Block5](https://www.block5lofts.com/), bringing loft apartments, retail space and a new [Hyatt Place](https://www.hyatt.com/hyatt-place/en-US/rapzr-hyatt-place-rapid-city-downtown) hotel to the community's downtown. Lloyd also is continuing construction on multiple apartment communities -- [Blackstone Flats](https://www.blackstoneflatssd.com/), which caters to income-qualified residents, is scheduled to wrap up in June, and [Buffalo Run](https://www.buffalorunsd.com/) will open its first phase of townhomes in mid-summer.  
  
To the south, work is wrapping up on a 14,000-square-foot addition to [Lewis & Clark Behavioral Health Services](https://lcbhs.net/) in Yankton and some smaller renovation projects at the University of South Dakota.

Lloyd's special projects group continues to support buildouts for Starbucks coffee shops, including locations in Harrisburg, Rapid City and Nebraska.  
  
""We're always taking on new opportunities and have some additional capacity,"" Fromm said. ""We anticipate hopefully sharing some updates in Sioux Falls in the coming weeks as well.""",1,1749222751.0,u_LloydCompanies,0,1.0,False

1l4uvbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1l4uvbo/things_i_had_to_teach_my_husband_to_stop_that_i/,Things I had to teach my husband to stop… that I am now realizing he got from his mother,"I need a reality check to make sure I am not the overbearing one here.

There are some things my husband did/does that I have tried really hard to help him un-learn because living with him has been difficult in some ways. I thought it was rudeness/selfishness/lack of empathy/selfawareness on his part, but I have since seen his mother do every single thing... so I think this stuff was normalized in his house growing up and I want to make sure I am not the one who is totally wrong!

Also to add, we both have generic white people families. None of this is overtly cultural. Although, I grew up in a house of undiagnosed neurodivergent people so maybe we are more used to accommodating people than other families?

The biggest one was in my last post, *deciding to nap on the couch*. We have 4 kids, it’s not only a bad example for them to see grown ups sleeping all day, but you aren't going to get any good sleep there. It's a loud house. Go to a bedroom if you need a nap, if you are trying to sleep on the couch while we are playing in the middle of the day, you are doing some weird performance and control thing, but it's certainly not napping. 

Took my husband almost 4 years to stop doing this, and his mom still does it. I have to treat them like surly teenagers and tell them to go to their rooms and come out when they are ready to participate in the family. Nevermind that I, as the mother, don't get to nap during the day.

Maybe I am a hypocrite in their eyes though, because I am the one who gets up in the morning with the kids (5 am, every morning, no my husband does not take shifts) and I will sometimes put on a quiet show for the kids and snooze on the couch for another hour or so. But it's because it's early morning, I am the only adult supervising, and I don't ever do it during the day or when all 4 kids need me. At best I get to 6/630am before it's impossible to get any more rest because enough kids are awake that it's not quiet anymore. I never nap during the day, couch or bedroom.


*Putting food back in the fridge after it has sat out for hours and hours at room temperature*. I know I am justified on this one, because the ONLY time we traveled to visit MIL's house my husband got sick with campylobacter, which is not even a common food poisoning, it's like next level food poisoning. The health department contacted him to try and trace the source SMH

MIL will leave her food out all day on a plate, and then put it back in the fridge like it's still good and she intends to eat it later (80% of the time she never touches it again).

I have worked in restaurants, I know a little bit about food safety. Especially certain foods like potatoes, it's not safe to eat after it's been sitting out. If it’s been exposed to saliva, you have a petri dish. 

She has some weird performance issues around food where she feels like she needs to explain how much she eats and why, and avoids certain things she thinks are unhealthy and tries to get us to do the same (but will eat other stuff that is objectively worse), and I suspect she purposely leaves the plates out with food on them to display how little she ate. 

She seems to think that eating small amounts is something to brag about. I might be reading too much into that but there is *something* disordered there.

 On her last visit she and DH left out my homemade pie, and lemon bars, overnight and I found them when I got up in the morning. Sounds maybe intentional, but she insisted on putting them in the fridge and continuing to eat them. I told her she's not allowed to feed that to my kids, and it's unsafe, but she can do what she wants with her own health. The texture wasn't even good anymore. 


This is just one example, it happens with something every visit and it's frequently a milk sippy cup one of the kids didn't finish drinking. Milk that is warm is not recoverable. But she still puts it in the fridge... barf.

We also have indoor cats. I keep telling her not to leave food and open container drinks around because the cats will get into it. The kids will knock cups over. She still refuses to use cups with lids, and frequently has 2 coffee mugs and 2 cups of water just hanging out around my house. Oh and 3-4 half drunk gatorades/coconut waters in the fridge.

And she calls my house cluttered! She's the clutterer! Yes we have toys everywhere but that's a life stage thing, not literal trash on our nice shelves.

That brings me to item 3, *putting a bunch of stuff on the kitchen counter and leaving it for me to deal with.*

Often DH or his mom will go food shopping, and they put the food out on the counter, on the stovetop, like a display, and graze from it. How am I supposed to cook with all my kitchen surfaces covered? Put it away GD it! It’s passive aggressive because they will never put these things away, it's saying ""here trashpanda we have another chore for you"" by leaving it all out. She does it on day 1 with stuff from her suitcase that she wants to gift to us, but doesn't even have a convo about it. Just puts it all on the counter like a buffet of her generosity... with the subtext that it's all now MY clutter to handle.

I also would never go into someone else's home and cover their kitchen counter with stuff, gifts and special foods or not. You don't mess with the host's kitchen, ever, unless you are helping clean. Am I wrong on that? I was raised to know, that is super rude.

She likes to buy us food she thinks we should eat, and just put it there instead of talking to us about it. It ends up being a waste.

Her last visit I tried something new- I took things that she put in our pantry a year ago and placed them on her bed for her to pack and take home, hope fully that wasn't too JN of me...

DH has one particular corner of the kitchen where he leaves stuff and doesn't ever put it away, which is manageable and an improvement from the past. But when his mom is here, she literally covers every counter surface with food and trinkets, and when I clear it all out she goes shopping and puts more out. I donate so much garbage from this woman.

She also puts her drink (one of them), glasses, cell phone, and used napkins/tissues on the shelves we have in the living room for displaying our valued travel items. They are supposed to keep our stuff safe and out of reach, while looking nice. She trashes one of the shelves with her stuff, every visit.

I was always taught that when you visit someone you keep your stuff to the area where you stay (bedroom, suitcase, dresser, etc) so that you don't lose things and so you aren't cluttering up someone's home. Are other people not taught that? Or does she know, and it's territorial.

*Laundry*. She folds a lot of laundry when she is here. Sounds helpful, right? No, if I were to do it all myself it would be faster, start to finish. She uses the laundry to make more work for me, and she places the folded laundry all over the couch so that I can't sit down and relax without first taking care of laundry.

DH used to do this on the rare occasions when he does laundry. I told him it's not helping with the laundry if you put it out on display, either put it in a basket in the very specific laundry area we have so we can put it away later... or put it away. Don't spread clean laundry piles all over the living room like you want to display your work, that makes *me* have to clean up the living room. Plus 4 kids and cats, most of the time I end up refolding everything they toss around because THE COUCH IS FOR SITTING OMG WHY IS THAT SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND.

Also, laundry is my favorite chore. I can sit and chat and get it done while spending time with people. I like things I can multitask.

I have explained this to her, and she took that and now makes sure every piece of laundry gets folded so that I don't do any and I am left with chores that take me to other rooms while the family plays in the living room. Helpful? Or passive aggressive?

Oh yeah and she does it to judge my clothes. There was that one time she decided she didn't like my underwear and took DH and her friends I don't know, to buy me new underwear. It went in the trash, because I have sensory issues and can only wear one style from one brand without going insane. She has also *accidentally* taken home my favorite swimsuit before, and brought it back 6 months later at her next visit. Yes it was her size.

*blocking walkways*
This one might be on me, as a DV survivor. Our home is old and not open concept, every room has a door and a hallway and with so many people there are frequently ""traffic jams."" My husband would follow me from room to room while I was doing chores, talking to me but not helping. He would stand in the doorway each time, which left me saying ""excuse me"" 100 times in an hour. It makes me feel like I have to ask permission to move around my own house, and like I am being observed by a supervisor not being helped like a partner. This was a real, and dangerous, issue in my first marriage.

I still have to remind DH sometimes to come all the way in the room and don't block the doorway. I feel like that's not just a PTSD thing, but actually a common courtesy thing. Does he block doorways at work to talk to people? No. So don't do it at home.

It's not hard to take 2 steps into the room so that anyone else can come in and out freely. He has gotten much better.

MIL does this, not just in doorways but she will follow me into the kitchen and stand right behind me, or shove me out of the way to put her coffee into the microwave while I am cooking (microwave is above the stovetop) or into the bathroom when I am bathing the kids and sitting next to the tub she will stand right where I am so that I can't even stand up without asking her to please move.


Her home is clean and uncluttered. I never saw her do any of this in her own home, which is why I thought it was malicious. But then I just (super late, hey autism) realized I had the same issues with DH for years, so it can't be unconnected...",32,1749222691.0,JUSTNOMIL,23,0.87,False

I'm a rising senior currently participating in a summer research program. The campus I'm on has tons of people doing research that aligns with my interests for graduate school, and I feel like this is the perfect opportunity to build connections, especially as the attitude here seems to be very conducive to mentoring and supporting budding scientists. 

I want to identify some folks whose research I'm most interested in and ask to grab coffee and talk about their research, but I have no idea what I'd actually say. I know the general advice is to ask them about their research, but what does that *mean*? Should I do a deep dive into their research and ask questions about their papers? I find that, most of the time, the questions I have after reading a paper mostly stem from not fully understanding the ideas/underlying concepts because I am simply not knowledgeable in that research area. Or should I instead ask more general questions about their research process, the field at large? 

Also, would it be too forward to ask them about opportunities in their lab as a prospective graduate student?

I know this is a large question and there's no one-size-fits-all way to approach conversations, but if anyone has some good advice they've ascertained fro their experiences, I'd really appreciate it :)",1,1749222469.0,gradadmissions,0,1.0,False

PREDEDICATED: 5months

Started with Pathoma videos gen path, and micro sketchy videos one daily Uworld did 1 pass on  tutor mode system wise supplementing it with other material like first aid, youtube vids, mehlman pdfs, its very convenient to use Digital form First aid as its good for annotating.

pathoma for every systems pathology( except hemat and musculoskeletal )

Anat& physiology for all systems - BNB (except hemat and musc)

For neurology- onlY BNB videos and mehlman pdf neuroanatomy is good. Dont do pathoma for this.

Immuno- mehlman pdf Neuroanatomy- mehlman pdf (this is GOLD) Dirty med ethics videos playlist Micro- sketchy videos Cardio- few dirty med videos for antiarrhythmics and ecg and heart sounds, murmurs

Uworld is gold. Enjoy the process of studying with the qbank and stuff will get easier as you keep doing. Dont get discourraged by low uw scores. They dont matter. Make sure u get the hang of time management sometime in ur prededicatd period itself so u get accustomed to it. Whenever u dont understand a concept. Make sure you understand it before moving forward

Make sure to take atleast one break day in a week to avoid burnout.

DEDICATED period: 2months

This is the time i started my second read of FA which took 1 month Started doing nbmes 25-31 Made a notebook of  wrong answers along with its explanation Also started my uworld second pass of incorrects on random but cud only do 1000 qs or so Also continued reviewing the mehlmans pdfs and youtube vids, and sketchy again.

During the last month i focused on sketchy FA for my tough areas.  Had a folder made on my laptop after second pass of FA With stuff that felt volatile to me. Or very high yield, like nephrotic nehpritic syndromes,  ovarian tumors inflammation etc. This folder i revisited every night Also started reviewing my nbme incorrects for a second time

Last week: focused on my weak areas Did free120 and revised it again 2 days before test day

Cudnt study much during the last week and focused on relaxing.

TEST DAY: packed fruits, coffee and a sandwich for food. Arrived at the centre an hour early and got through security checks. Had a good nights sleep so that helped calm my nerves.

Exam is doable guys. If u feel confused in any q flag it and move on. U can revisit it later if time permits. All the best to everyone! You've got this.",4,1749222367.0,step1,2,1.0,False
1l4uqhq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMallWorld/comments/1l4uqhq/hosted_a_party_last_night/,Hosted a party last night,"Good morning! I had a very vivid dream last night where myself and all my friends were in a mall - shocking! Lots of store where we were to buy supplies for the party. Of course the cafeteria style restaurant was there too. Why is that place always out of food or closed?!

Anyways, we ended up in a super crowded restaurant but quickly transitioned to a huge home with 40 foot tall ceilings in the living area and an attached kitchenette and bedroom. All had floor to ceiling windows. A couple that was in their 60s  or 70s owned the home. I think the husband had dementia like my dad and was very irritable. His small terrier dogs were hiding from him under the bed because he was yelling. The wife was sweet and told me she loved the way I had organized the kitchen for them. 

I had to get to work making drinks for everyone. The men had a coffee drink and the women a fruity one. I knew we were beginning a group vacation and would be staying the night so I was ready to get hammered (I don’t drink IRL). I never fully finished the drinks but they were being brought outside to the guests to sip poolside.

I have a glimpse of the end zone of a college football game. The stadium was adjacent to the house. I must have put it there so my husband had something to do. Before I woke up, a van full of celebrities showed up for the party. The only one I remember was Jeremy Allen White.

1l4uptr,https://i.redd.it/7u425g4hnb5f1.jpeg,lazy guide from unemployed to employed in CS,"Few things to throw out there: be social, touch grass and never say ""no"" to yourself.

The world is unfair. Things are not ""sow what you can reap."" Things are ""sow what you can reap and get lucky(will explain luck as ""unfair advantages"").

**Step 1 : Resume**

*Basic/Generic tips:*

Have a clean resume. Order the sections: Personal info, education, skills, experience, projects, activities.

\- keep education and skills sections short (ideally no more than 2-3 lines each)

\- ideally have 4 personal projects with github links and as many experiences titled ""SWE or MLE""

\- the hardest thing is applying before having that 1st full year of experience, after gets better

*Specific tips:*

\- emphasize 60-80% of skills mentioned under skill section in each experience and each projects (also helps having small skills section i.e. two lines vs 6 lines, show quality)

\- get resume roasted by everyone, ask for it often. There is a direct correlation between those who actively ask for feedback to landing interviews versus those who sit and wait. (better if the feedback comes from a more senior person than you)

\- optimize resume for every type of reader. Types of readers are recruiters (who drink starbucks and graduated liberal arts), the interviewer (most involved with day to code, thinks their generation of coders are better), the shot caller (the senior manager who usually is kind and not too involved with code), the committee (present in some cases) and sometimes investors (if small startup) or referrer (the person who is referring you for position to make them look good)

\- optimize for every length of read (4sec, 10sec, 1min, etc). The 4sec read: graduation date clear, school prestige or very high gpa (not make or break), skills on top, number of relevant SWE or MLE exp and first line of first exp. 10sec read: all the bullets in first exp have metrics and are single line, projects mention hours worked, if its a personal project or class project, and clean readme.MDs linked. 1min read: linkedin and all URLs are well kept, ideally link 1-2 blogs



**Step 2 : Job Applications & getting Interviews**

*Basic/Generic tips:*

Do it all. Mass apply, Career fairs. Apply to startups, send DMs on linkedin and email. Now the best ROI might be an engineer who can refer you to a small startup.

*Mass applying-* its hard to stand out, even with the perfect resume. Still play your odds to get the OA.

*Career Fairs* are lesser competitions but the competition is your peers. Say of 300 dropped resumes 10-20 are selected for interviews. But you never know if maybe that you. So never say “no” to yourself. Drop your resume.

*Apply to startups*. Go to accelerator pages like YC, Techstars, goto VC pages like Greylock, a16z, follow important people under talent, HR, operations or ""platform"" in VC firms and see if they post opportunities. Many do and just apply.



*Specific tips:*

*Linkedin DM people.* Keep a short message that highlights a little bit of effort / research as your hook. Can be as simple as ""hey I went to same school or I know someone who went to same school or saw your recent post and thought to reach out."" I personally would never start with ""Hey X, my name is Y"" because on linkedin messages it gives you a preview of the message before you open it. You want your preview to be captivating enough to make it as easy to open as possible. I would refrain from being too captivating or attention grabbing but simply ""interesting, thoughtful or different.""



Like if someone opens the DM, **you are already winning.**

*An engineer who can refer you to a startup* is probably the most ROI. This is someone who can vouch for your skills or your vibe in a small startup. Ideally this person knows you from school, sports or there is some years of context. Again this is one of those ""life is unfair cards."" Also even if you met an eng over 1-2 coffee chats and the vibe is great AND they think okay of you then ask them to put in a word. You might get the interview solely based on the trust that their employee put in a word. Again never say no your self and not ask. ""Ask"" for that interview.

**Step 3 : Passing Interviews**

To pass interviews, simply prepare. There is really no shortcut. Some people have been leetcoding for 2 years daily, others save their weekends to do 10 problems, you have to just be consistent.

*Basic/Generic tips:*

If you had a really good DS or Algo course and you can recall the fundamentals well then you have an ""unfair advantage."" If common DSA function definitions are not clear to you (like the code behind popping from a stack), than consider relearning the core ""classes"" and objects before you swarm on leetcode.

As you do leetcode time your sessions to like 20 min. Try to come up with an approach and first few lines of a solution within these first 20 minutes. If nothing is coming to mind, just look at the solution and try a similar problem. THIS part of trying after failing is where most people give up.

Do more mock interviews. Mock interviews test your talking skills as you code. Sometimes during a real interview if you will not arrive at a solution that runs but if you had an elaborate plan or ""seemingly you can solve it,"" you might actually get that next round. Like if you get a really hard problem in an interview that you have never seen and are panicking inside but you remain calm and try to be as methodical as possible, you never know how the interviewer sees you and grades you. All the mock interviewing helps in this case where you are 10% or 1% chance of passing. Of course, mock interviews also help in cases where you have a concrete approach stick out immediately and you explain your story in a clear understandable way.

many cs majors think talking is not important and only leetcoding is important. Practice talking, do mock interviews.

For OAs, with so many people get high scores. Do what most do. Everyone now gets an OA, so getting one is almost like part of the job application. Consider doing them after knowing what you can expect whether its someone who has done it on campus before or the leetcode discuss section (leetcode premium is worth it).

For startups and project based interviews, learn the frameworks to your best abilities before you interview or start timed assessments. Again this is one of those ""unfair advantages"" where if you have been coding for a longer time you will have a higher chance.



*Specific tips:*

For each round of interviews, have a solid 1min pitch of yourselves and ask questions at the end. People who ask questions at the end are twice more likely to get interviews than people who are not. Good questions to ask are like ""what was you most nervous day at work OR how does this company differ from your pervious company OR what is your biggest professional accomplishment to date?"" like try to get some emotional, throwback or nostalgic vibe as a response.

Similarly your 1min pitch, refer to yourself a software engineer NOT a cs student. Ie ""About me: I am a software engineer with strong skills in X and Y. Most recently I interned or worked at ... or I built this which got users, made money or won this challenge. Or if you did none of that just show effort. ""Most recently I built THIS project which I spent 50+ hours"" on and talk about some technical stats or impressive thing about said project or exp.

People recall how something started and how something ended so a good 1 min pitch and a good question to ask at end helps with striking a good impression.



**Bonus 1 : Post Offer**

*Basic/Generic tips:*

Many people relax after their first full-time offer, but in reality for the very first time you have leverage. You created an ""unfair advantage."" If you have any ongoing recruiting networking chats, Linkedin DMs or interviews lined up, share that you have an offer and see if that gets you a final round at other places. You don't have to mention the company name or salary but just say you have an offer. Of course, if the company is good or comparable ie you got meta but interviewing at google you can name drop. An offer is an offer. Use any offer so long its $80K-100K minimum and use it to get more offers.

The moment you have two offers, try negotiating. Again you do not have to disclose the amount each is giving but more so about how much more the other is willing to add. Note you do not need a second offer to negotiate. You just might have a little more leverage to do so but again you absolutely do not have to.

If entry-level roles now want senior-level talent and you just got an offer its your right now to negotiate like a senior level talent. So ASK for more. Do not feel guilty that ""I didn't have an offer all this time so now I will just accept whatever is given."" Again never say never.

So here are 5 things you can negotiate and in probably this order. Base salary, stock, sign on bonus, end of year bonus and location + relocation bonus. Sometimes startups will pay for housing or partial housing too. Base salary is king. Startups also recognize that their equity might be worth zero to an employee and so are willing to give more cash these days. Of course the AI labs like openai and anthropic are the best in this base comp.

For return intern offers, you can negotiate salary in creative ways. One way is to pick the highest paying locations like sf/nyc/seattle (if you are open to that). Nyc tends to be the number one destination for new grads, so the competition might be steep. But if you performed well in an internship you can use that ""unfair advantage"" like talk to my manager. You can also say things like family emergency or do things to create urgency in your location ask.



*Specific tips:*

If you are feeling gutsy, demand a skip level offer. Again if you have been coding for a while on your own, it's almost your right. There is such a wide spectrum of CS students so if you feel you are an echelon or two above, go ask for a higher level interview. Many students take gap years to work full-time or do 5-6 internships so if this is you, go ask for skip level. That's an immediate *20% base salary bump* or more.

While this is not necessarily a pay bump, another thing you can negotiate is what team or product line to work one. If you can identify teams that are in their infancy stages during your stint as an intern or research from peers and you see the team potentially blowing up ie this team will be high visibility because of revenue or users or importance to CEO, demand to be put on that team. Of course it's a bet, but if there is a good chance that team grows like crazy you might also get promoted quickly which again is a *20% base salary bump* or more.



**Bonus 2 : International Students** 

*Basic/Generic tips:*

You just have to work twice as hard and adopt a really good english accent. If people are doing neetcode 150, you have make your own neetcode 300. If people are publishing papers, you have to get the harder publications. DO MORE.

About the english accent comment -- the world is unfair. If two people have same qualifications but one person has an outside accent, that will likely not be in your favor in most cases.

Here's how to turn it into an ""unfair advantage."" Someone had to be there in your shoes and has ""made it"" in the industry. Find that person, find common names in your subcontinent or community and add  your desired company and role on linkedin search and reach out to them. Best case scenario is if they end up being your interviewer or shot caller i.e. director or hiring manager, they see a younger version of themselves in you and they have the  power, influence or budget to sponsor. That is your best case.

As engineers, we prepare for the worst case. So in addition to doing everything above twice or thrice more, work on your english. Most international students only hang out with international students. Maybe mix your circles with other US folks, watch TV shows or if you really want to actively practice your english accent. You have you put your ego down and accept that if the world is unfair to most people it's doubly unfair to you. Yes, there is always an international person in the network who has made it without all this english accent ""theatrics"" but unless you are an anomaly by like 3 standard deviations ie if you are a math olympiad in your country or something, than do not bet on having the same luck as the ""international person in the network who got a job."" Prepare for the worst case.

Two other things to keep in mind as an international is, your number one hair on fire problem is not getting a job. Its staying in the US longer. So if you have to get a masters, volunteer, or whatever to get more time to stay in the US, do it. If you can extend time in US by 40 days, 90 day or 3 years depending on your situation, do it. Getting a job comes after being in the US. You are likely to face much more scrutiny and difficulty applying from home country. Again it is possible but not plausible.



*Specific tips:*

The second thing to keep in mind, is your job to stay in US does not end after getting an offer that is willing to sponsor you. So many things can go wrong. For starters if its h1b, that's a lottery, it can take 3 attempts before you get it or maybe you never get it. Maybe you get laid off before the 3rd or 4th attempt. Consider getting the o1 visa. Many people think you need to win a noble prize to qualify but there are quicker ways to circumvent. 1) Judge on a panel --> go judge a hackathon and ask for a letter proof (ideally its a big name uni). 2) Published work --> pay a magazine to talk about one your ml projects or some success you have (sometimes local newspapers or school newspaper will do for free and make sure its on a URL) 3) get a high salary offer (the avg salary in the US is pretty low, so any swe salary is high and in cases if you need a high salary in your domain, specify your domain as ""tech"" so than you with a proper SWE or MLE offer will look ""high salary"" compared to other ""tech"" jobs like IT, QA etc). Get a really good lawyer, get 5-6 letters of recommendations from CEOs and ML researchers, and the percentage of your o1 passing if a lawyer accepts you application is quite high (ranges 91-94%). The lawyer costs usually 10-14k and make sure they have done before for others.

1l4uo1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1l4uo1g/in_honor_of_my_spaniversary_on_june_1st_heres_the/,In honor of my Spaniversary on June 1st here's the story of my interesting Spanish learning journey. And my last trip to Colombia.,"Hello everyone, 

June 1st was my one year Spaniversary (feel free to use the word), and because I've learned a decent amount in a short time and had some interesting experiences I'd thought I'd share my story. This will probably be a long post so feel free to gloss over it. 

TW: I'm not a Dreaming Spanish purist, but this is the best community and still probably accounts for 90% of my learning.

In May of last year I began working on a cruise ship as a musician, I was playing percussion. I was the only American in the band (and in general there were only about 6 or 7 employees from the US on the ship). One of my bandmates was from Lithuania, and one from Italy (but lives in Argentina) with the rest being from South America (specifically Colombia, Chile, and Argentina). My bandmates were excellent people and musicians and we all really enjoyed our time together. One thing really made me feel kind of bad though, at meals and our time away from work my friends had to speak english. I know they didn't mind, but we were working an itinerary in the Bahamas and stopped in Florida once a week so knowing they were further from home than myself I wanted to make sure they were able to feel more at home. Everyone on the ship speaks good english, its a requirement for the job, really it was just slangs and idioms most employees needed to learn. (I always say ""gotcha"" so this quickly became a fan favorite on the ship.)

On June 1st I decided it was time to start learning Spanish. I took a spanish class in university not too long before this, but I learned that I don't like that kind of structure for learning a language, or in my case learning to pass tests in other languages. So I dropped the class and didn't learn much more than ""donde esta \_\_\_\_\_?"" and ""my llamo Colton"". Every day I would do a couple lessons of language transfer, one unit from Duolingo, and lots of Dreaming Spanish averaging about 3-5 hours a day as musicians on ships have lots of free time. My best friends on the ship happened to all be Colombian so I decided I would learn mostly from Shelcin and Natalia. Between these videos and talking to my friends I started developing an appreciation for Colombia. 

I was on the ship from May-August. The last couple weeks I met the crew barber from Honduras and we made a deal, every night I would buy him a beer and we would cross talk for 30 minutes. I was surprised how much I learned at the time and kind of got an ego about it if I'm being honest, typical leo behavior. This last month I also decided after working on the ship I would go to Colombia to visit my friend Mauricio in his city of Pereira. 

September rolled around and I was off to Colombia, I arrived in Pereira and it was a blast. We went to bars, mountains, ate lots of food, and I got to go to a few family get togethers which was my favorite part. I learned REALLY quick though that my Spanish was not what I thought it was and I needed a lot more work. At this point I was able to order food, ask for directions and really just navigate but nothing more. Every day in Colombia when I went back to my airbnb I would study though, using the same tools mostly. 

I returned home in October and I was now obsessed with Spanish. I wanted to be able to actually converse and hangout without feeling the need for translation. So back to studying. At this point I started working at a grocery store so my daily routine would be wake up, study, work, back home to study, and sleep. I also started watching Spanish Boost Gaming and started to really like the Buenos Aires accent. I also found the ""sh"" sound to be a little easier for me so it was a good fit. I now was watching mostly Augustina and Martin. 

This continued for a couple months then in December I was feeling depressed and this was lowering my study time, so I did what anyone logical person would do.... I booked another vacation in Colombia for March. Knowing that that I was going back to Colombia kept me motivated. In January I began doing iTalki lessons with a man from Cordoba (Argentina) which was 100% cross talk. He was also a musician so we always had fun lessons. I would do this once a week only about 6 lessons, but at this point my focus was more on listening with CI and podcast more so than anything so it was fine. 

The three weeks before my vacation I was starting to get nervous that I would look like a fool when I spoke, and I also felt a little bit of pressure because I had a friend going that speaks 0 Spanish, but I kept pushing through and in March I landed in Bogota. 

At the airport  a man approached us and asked (in English) if we needed a taxi, usually I would just Uber but I wanted to get to the Airbnb so we decided since he's right there. We got in and he apologized saying he doesn't speak the best english so I knew it was my time to begin my real test. The ride was about 30 minutes and the whole way we were talking in Spanish, I was able to crack some jokes, asked for recommendations and some just random conversations. I was shocked! Then in the Airbnb my friend said ""I'm really impressed, I can't believe you speak that much Spanish. It would take me years to learn that."" And now my doubts and fears were mostly gone. 

We were spending a week in a different city (Bogota, Pereira, Medellin, then Cartagena). The week in Bogota wasn't TOO eventful, we did get haircuts and I talked to the barbars in Spanish and we only had to use translation apps a handful of times during our small talk, but when I was telling them what style I'd like I didn't have to use any crutches which was nice. The other highlight of Bogota for me were the musuems. My friend was INCREDIBLY uncomfortable in Colombia because the culture shock and tbh I was getting tired of playing translator since I was far from fluid. 

The next week in Pereira we arrived and walked around downtown a bit. Back to the airbnb we were just kind of watching TV then I decided to get a coffee, my friend stayed behind. When I got back he said he booked a flight  home and was leaving the next day. I was partially happy I couldn't focus on myself and not have to translate, I was more upset that my friend didn't love the country as much as I do, but such is life.

I needed to find new things to do and I didn't want to feel alone so I needed to make some friends (Mauricio was on the ship so he wasn't home). This is where the real trip began. 

In Pereira I went to a jam session at a bar (Shuffle Live Music) and met some people there. I liked the vibes, it reminded me of a bar in St. Louis with punk/hardcore music so I would go back every night. I also knew of a coffee vendor from my last trip that was a friend of Mauricios and he recognized me instantly from my last trip so I would go get coffee and talk to him daily too. One night at the bar I was wearing my Pereira jersey and my friends told me there was a game the next day so I bought tickets for me and a few others and went to my first soccer game ever, and it was in South America! 

At the game there was a friend of one of the people I went with so we talked and hung out afterwards, I was invited to a bbq the next day (one of the highlights of my trip.) We had a blast, I was there for  hours and didn't speak a single word in English. When I didn't know a word I would use gestures to ask how to say something. A funny example, the day before I went to Cocora and was telling my friends about it. I didn't know the word for goat so I made fake horns and said ""como se llama? baaaaaaa"" 

Pereira was a blast but it was off to Medellin, which instantly become my favorite CITY in Colombia, I write city in caps because I'd like to point out I prefer the smaller pueblos (Filandia, Florida and Salenca to name a few). Medellin was mostly the same thing with different scenery. Musuems, mountains and I went to a jam session at a bar owned by an American so admittedly in  Medellin I spoke a lot more English but I was also mentally drained at this point so it was fine. The highlight of Medellin was the botanical garden. It was really informative and fun. 

Then to Cartagena. 

I landed in Cartagena, walked out the airport and my first thought was ""que calor tan chimba!"" 

I DID not like Cartagena because that was a type of heat I never wanted to experience in my life, but I did manage to go to a couple spots I've seen in Shelcins videos, my favorite being the mall that was a matador ring. Because the extreme heat (115 with humidity) I did spend most of my time inside and didn't do too much in Cartagena tbh. 

I got back home in April and I've been working at a Mexican restaurant since. At work I mostly speak Spanish unless it's really busy or if my coworkers are asking what something means, or want to practice English. 

Now the plan is to continue looking for another job on a ship, but if that doesn't pan out I will do a world packers trip to Argentina. Learning a second language has opened up doors I've never thought possible, took me on some great adventures and one thing I didn't like about myself before is my inability to commit which is now not an issue. I'll continue learning Spanish... and now French ;) 

Some thank yous: the r/dreamingspanish community, I mostly lurk but seeing peoples progress and joy with the language is a huge motivator. Shelcin, Augustina, and Natalia for being my teachers and Shelcin being the best Fortnite player on twitch. Pablo for making this platform, which has changed all our lives for the better and a HUGE thank you to all my friends I've met along the way in Colombia, on the ship and at home.",8,1749222187.0,dreamingspanish,2,1.0,False

Cognitive scientists have a saying:​

“Maslow before Bloom”​

It’s the idea that if we want to engage in ‘higher-order thinking’ (Bloom’s Taxonomy), we need to fulfill basic human needs like sleep, food, rest, etc.… (Maslow’s Hierarchy).

And it makes sense.

Imagine trying to learn graduate-level physics with no sleep, intoxicated and as hungry as a bear after hibernation.

It would be a nightmare.

Fulfilling these needs should hold priority over any extra time you would’ve gained from studying or learning. Learning is only secondary.  
  
​

2. Don’t learn if you won’t implement​

An easy way to forget what you learn is to never use it.

Research shows that retrieval (withdrawing information from long-term memory into conscious awareness) can improve memory by up to 50%- if done within a 24-hour time frame.

The issue we face when letting time pass is that our memory quickly drops after learning something new — this effect is modeled by the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve.

So, even if it’s a quick retrieval session (a few minutes), it’s worth doing.  
​

3. Active Learning > Passive Learning​

Learning techniques require active engagement.

Zoning out while reading textbooks or watching lectures won’t cut it.

1 hour spent:

* Constructing knowledge
* Creating inferences
* Applying knowledge

Will always outweigh 4 hours spent passively reading textbooks or listening to lectures.

It’s a habit you’ll acquire over time, so long as you practice self-awareness and push yourself to engage.

But without it, you can’t learn effectively.

4. Good learning requires cognitive discomfort​

Quality learning comes from quality thinking.

And if you’re not using your brain’s mental resources, you’re not learning.

This principle underlies most learning techniques.

But, it’s also a useful litmus test you can use to see whether you’re engaging in the right type of thinking.

5. How to stop banging your head against the wall​

We often waste hours struggling to understand a concept or solve a problem, hoping things click.

When the real issue (more often than not) is that we’ve processed the text from the wrong perspective.

Solution?

Take a break. Work on something else, and give your mind time to enter a diffused state so that it has a fresh set of eyes.

This will allow you to interpret what you’ve read differently the next time around, increasing the chances that it makes sense.  
​

6. Practice beyond mastery is (usually) a waste of time​

You’ve (likely) spent hours practicing the same exercises (static repetition), over and over again, with little to no gain.

This (usually) stems from the belief that more practice leads to more learning.

However, this argument leaves out two key details:​

* Little to no learning occurs once you reach unconscious incompetence with minimal errors.​
* Opportunity cost exists. So, based on your learning stage would other techniques have led to better outcomes?​

When we consider this, we find that static repetition (in general) is a waste of time.

So what’s the alternative?

Variable practice.

This type of practice uses drills, problems, and exercises across different contexts and with different variables.

This approach to practice increases your surface area of learning (ensuring your time is well spent).

7. Research experts.​

At the start of a learning project, we have no new knowledge to build on.

This makes it one of the hardest learning stages.

But we can short-cut the time it takes to build a base level of knowledge by spending time learning how experts think about a subject.

By researching:​

* Mental Models
* General Principles
* Important Categories​

etc…

We create a foundation for new knowledge to build on, and we save ourselves the time it would’ve taken to build it from scratch.

8. Always Plan​

Expert learners are self-regulated learners.

And it’s because good planning precedes good learning.

And if you don’t plan, you end up with unfocused effort and half-learned concepts.

How much time you plan should depend on the nature and quantity of content. I aim to spend 5% of my learning time planning and reflecting on learning outcomes.

Doing this will keep your sessions more focused, which will lead to more learning.  
​

9. Avoid distractions​

1 hour of deep study > 4 hours of distracted learning.

Nail this mantra into your head every day.

It’s one of the reasons we struggle to learn anything meaningful.

Our brain processes a limited amount of information, and wasting its resources by focusing on brain-rotting internet videos is doing you a disservice.  
​

10. You’re not born an expert learner.​

Most social environments (home, school, friends) make us believe that intelligence is the only predictor of learning outcomes.

But that’s false.

Learning skills (among other variables) tend to matter more.

And learning skills (like anything) are learnable, which means that even if you find it hard to learn new things, you can get better.

This is an essential perspective to have as you work your way to become a better learner.  
​

11. Knowledge Obsessed.​

In an interview with Yorkshire Television, Richard Feynman (a well-known physicist) made an interesting point that I remember to this day.

In his words:

“If you give me the right man, in any field, I can talk to him. But I know what the condition is, that he did whatever he did, to go as far as he could go!”

I still get goosebumps hearing it.

His observation was that certain kinds of men/women (in any field) are always looking to stretch their minds as far as they can go.

They’re never satisfied with what they know, and they’re always looking to learn more.

It’s a core tenant of being great at whatever skill you choose to learn.  
​

Here’s the link: [Richard Feynman — The World from another point of view](https://preview.convertkit-mail2.com/click/dpheh0hzhm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1HTmhsTlNMUUFGRQ==)

12. Big picture overview → Fine-tuned details​

Imagine you’re given the task of building a house.

Most of us would build a base, carve out some details, then add some final touches and furniture.

That would be the most logical plan.

But we tend to overlook the same logic when learning.

​  
Instead of:​

Base Knowledge → Ideas → Details​

We do:​

Details → Ideas → Base Knowledge​

When we insist on understanding every detail (instead of skimming around and then diving deeper) we start at the wrong learning layer and waste time as a result.

This one behavior (if changed) will easily become the highest-leverage learning activity in your tool belt (saving you mountains of time).

13. The anecdote to most learning problems​

Most learning problems can be solved by better understanding the topic.

This means:​

* More connections
* Improved knowledge structures
* More prior knowledge integration​

From memory issues to trouble applying or thinking critically, I’ve (almost) always solved these problems by improving my understanding.

It’s a good reference point to have when you feel stuck- it’s often the answer.

14. Space your studies​

This ranks among the best learning techniques in most studies (specifically for long-term retention).

And the best part?

It’s not about engaging your brain in a certain way, but about organizing your studies differently than you do now.

Instead of learning a lot in a short period, you spread out your learning sessions on a topic.

I’d recommend doing a 1-day/1-week/1-month split for everything you learn.

(This means retrieving it in those intervals)

15. Feedback is overpowered​

Action produces information.

And this information (feedback) can reveal hidden gaps in our knowledge.

These small (or large) corrections found in how we understand and apply what we’ve learned are crucial for getting the details in our knowledge right.

They’re a natural part of learning since we might process information incorrectly or miss important features.

The more feedback loops you cycle through, the better you’ll get.

16. Refine your perspective​

A theme you find among experts is the # of books they read on a given topic.

More books = More knowledge.

And reading books about a topic from different perspectives allows you to expand on what you know.

In cognitive psychology, this technique is known as variable encoding.

It’s one of the best ways to build a large interconnected web of knowledge once you’ve already reached an intermediate level of understanding.  
​

17. Long-Term Learning.​

We’ve been taught to learn for challenges that are just around the corner.

The next test, the next presentation, the next project, etc.

But doing so can make us blind to what matters most- long-term learning.

Instead, we want to learn with the end in mind.

And we do this through knowledge maintenance.

Ask yourself:

* How will I use this information in the long term?
* What exercises can I do to test myself?
* How often should I revisit this, factoring in its importance? ​

If you reflect on these questions, you’ll be able to create a plan that allows for a lasting understanding.

18. Learning > Performance​

Successful students and self-learners alike focus on learning > performing.

And the irony is that doing so leads to better learning outcomes- all while keeping the motivation to learn high.

If I had to narrow down which mindset shift sparked my motivation to learn, it would be this.

If you focus on learning you never lose, you learn.  
​

19. Generate inferences​

An inference is created when we combine what we know with information from the text to infer something new.​

(Prior knowledge) + (Text) → Inference​

For instance:​

* (Bears can attack humans) + (Johnny was lost in the woods 2 days ago, and a bear is on the loose) → Johnny was (probably) attacked by a bear​
* (Gravity Exists) + (I threw an apple from a building) → The apple will hit the ground​
* (Sugar is sweet) + (We’ve added 2 tablespoons of sugar to the coffee) → The coffee should taste sweeter.​​

All of these are generated by thinking about conclusions that stem from the text and what we know.​

(Hence the word ‘inference’)​

The quality & quantity of your inferences will determine how well you understand the material.

That’s why it’s an essential part of learning anything (especially theory-based subjects).​

More inferences. More learning.

20. Practice. Practice. Practice​

Practice should be the cornerstone of any learning project.

Percentage wise I usually try to have a 5:1 ratio on how much I practice.

But again, this depends on the task.

The simpler it is (tying your shoe) the less practice it’s going to require.

21. Study examples​

Content isn’t enough, we also need to solve problems.

And that’s where examples come in.

We can reverse engineer worked examples to see the method used without having to figure it out ourselves.

Doing so creates mental frameworks that we can apply across contexts to solve other problems down the road.​

Tip: I’ve found it useful to combine worked examples with a practice session afterward

22. Interleave your studies​

Similar to spaced retrieval, **interleaving** is one of the most studied learning techniques.

It restructures how we solve problems so that we can make more connections and replicate the context in which we’ll be using the information more accurately.​

(It’s especially effective for S.T.E.M fields)​

Instead of solving one type of problem for an entire practice session (blocked practice), you mix them up (mixed practice).​​

AAABBBCCC → ABCBACCBA

​  
It’s the best way to structure your practice sessions (according to science).

23. Evaluative thinking​

Evaluative thinking is one of the core tenets of higher-order thinking (check Bloom’s Taxonomy)

This means that evaluating pieces of information through comparison helps engage the right kind of thinking and will create more connections in your brain as a result.

I suggest using this approach when trying to understand similarities or differences between concepts.

Doing so will create fine-tuned connections that will help you apply what you’ve learned and gain a deep understanding of the material.​

24. Have fun​

This is the most important lesson.

If you don’t have fun while you’re learning, what’s the point?

Our brains are wired to generate dopamine when we’re on the verge of new knowledge, and it would be a shame if we treat learning as just a means to an end.​

Learn for fun- that’s what matters.​

That’s it for this post.

I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.

*Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

Gryzzk was back in a familiar place - the ship repairs had been completed and he was back in his command chair. Now it was time to put the ship through it's paces - this time in a mock battle with the former Third Vilantian Warfleet, now the Throne's Dawn Mercenary Company. The Throne's Dawn was in the familiar Throne's Star formation, awaiting the countdown. Gryzzk had added an additional challenge to scenario; he put his second shift bridge squad in play for this first battle. The weapons and shields had been set to training mode. Theoretically no damage would actually come to the ship, however the damage would be reflected in the ship's behavior. A small timer with a countdown showed when the exercise would begin.

""XO, stations report readiness?""

""They do Freelord Major - Patrick is still very unhappy with you, even though I told him the repairs allowed him to go deeper than he had ever gone within me before.""

""Noted, XO. Once the scenarios are concluded, please calculate the precise amount of rum I will require to forget that you ever said that.""

""Of course Freelord."" Rosie's smile was impish for a moment.

""Corporal Yomios, please open a channel to *Stalwart Rose*.""

""Channel open Cap- er, Major."" The Moncilat was certainly a different sight compared to Reilly. They'd had to add a few options to the stations to accommodate the much taller and slimmer forms - mainly a slide so the Moncilat could work in relative comfort without making it impossible for their Terran counterparts to work afterwards.

Gryzzk nodded casually. ""Captain Rostin, you've briefed the stations regarding the plan?""

""Yes Freelord. Shuttles are standing by.""

""Release at your discretion, Captain. Scenario beginning in 3...2...1.""

The timer flashed purple, and then everything happened at once. Miroka gently accelerated the ship and dove, arcing toward what was designated as the lower ship; Laroy fired a spread of railgun rounds toward the engines that passed all around the *Stalwart Rose* as it dove to the engine cone. As it dove, *Stalwart Rose* released their shuttles, each of which began skimming over hulls and then screamed to maximum acceleration over the bridges of their targets before wheeling and dodging incoming fire. Larion was calmly calling out ships being pummeled and advising of their own damage received, with intermittent updates on *Stalwart Rose*. Of the entire second-squad, he seemed to be the most comfortable with what was happening.

Gryzzk looked at his tablet and nodded as the readouts gave a good idea of what was happening. They were targeting the *Twilight Rose*, and getting pummeled with plasma fire. The Throne's Dawn had a bit of a score to settle, even though it was a practice. Laroy had fired several countermeasure clusters and subsequent disabling torpedoes while Miroka had thrown the ship into a sweeping arc at the edge of the area, keeping the ship dodging and defending.

In a span of minutes, the scenario had concluded. *Twilight Rose* was the overall victor, having suffered minimal damage. *Stalwart Rose* was somewhat maneuverable, while the ships of the Throne's Dawn had all been disabled or destroyed.

The first squad came out of the conference room as systems reset and Rosie seemed to stand a little taller. O'Brien led the charge. ""Laroy you jumped up redneck french bastard child of an alligator and a moonshine still, can ye not tell me what a plasma cannon's for?! They're no' there to look pretty on the hull, they're for shooting, so bloody shoot them once!""

Laroy scrunched his face. ""Ser'eant the range was way too far out for 'em.""

""Bull-fucking-shit, full seventy percent of the damage we took was from their plasma rounds - you gonna sit there and tell me they got better guns than we do? Outta yer goddamned mind."" O'Brien pointed to conference room. ""Park your skinny ass in there and pray Lord Jesus calls you home before I get in there.""

While O'Brien had been in full-throated cranky, each of the other members of the first squad had gone to their stations to critique and give some hard-earned advice. Hoban was being...close, placing his hands under Miroka's and showing how to overdrive systems - his advice seemed to be that in combat, a ship needed to be driven like it had been stolen. Reilly was reminding Yomios of the communication countermeasures that hadn't been engaged and tapping the console a few times for emphasis. Meanwhile Edwards was going down a checklist, reminding Larion that he needed to initiate the crossfeed to Laroy's console to mark the targets properly.

They ran through several more mock battles with various personnel combinations - overall the Throne's Dawn still seemed stuck in some way; the Throne's Star that had been their start formation was being tested and shredded time and again by the Legion's darting and twisting tactics. As a group, the improvement every time was marked as the two groups learned to work and mesh together in various combinations. However every time Laroy was on tactical, O'Brien would come out of the conference room as a wailing banshee from the nightmares of naughty children - subsequently Laroy would come out smelling ashamed and angry while O'Brien came out just angry. As the day ended, Gryzzk finally beckoned Rosie to his quarters.

""XO, ordinarily I would not ask this, but I should like to listen in on the conference room. I need to know if Laroy is being singled out unfairly or if the things she is pointing out are legitimate.""

Rosie smirked. ""You're gonna like this, Freelord.""

The conference room lit up on his holographic display, showing both Laroy and O'Brien with their feet up on the conference room table and drinking coffee.

Laroy was talking. ""Okay, this-un's a classic back home. An Englishman, a Scotsman and an Irishman wander into a little old pub in Kildare. They each ask the barman for a pint of Guinness. Pints are on the bar and wouldn't you know it three bluebottles drop into each man’s fresh pint. The Englishman pushes his pint away in disgust and orders up another. The Scot reaches in and plucks the fly out. The Irishman reaches in, picks the fly out, flicks the thing in the ass and shouts, 'Spit it out ye wee bastard.' ""

O'Brien snorted. ""That one's older than your grandmother's thong. Try this one - Boudreaux's finally getting married to Marie, and he ain't never had 'the talk', so he goes to his buddy Hebert and asks what he's supposed to be doing come the wedding night. Hebert says 'Easy, all you gotta do is put the biggest part of you up against the hairiest part of her, and nature'll sort itself out right quick.' Boudreaux comes back from his honeymoon and down at the bar Hebert runs into him. Hebert asks how it went and Boudreaux just shrugs. Hebert goes 'You mean you mean you had all that for two weeks and you come back just shrugging?' Boudreaux says 'Well, I did what you told me to, but I don't see what's so special about shoving my nose in her armpit.' ""

Laroy chuffed softly. ""Turrible joke, Ser'ent-Major."" He checked his tablet absently. ""Oop. Bout that time. Get it rolling so we smell right.""

Gryzzk left his quarters with a neutral look on his face, assuming his command chair position as O'Brien came out roaring furiously a few minutes later. ""...Now you get your ass squared away by this time tomorrow or I'm ordering you to wear gloves whenever you're on station so your incompetent tomfuckery does not infect my beloved tactical station, am I understood?!"" She sat at her station and began stabbing furiously at the console.

""Hooah Ser'ent-Major.""

""Don't fuckin' 'hooah' me you godless Navy wannabe - you *earn* the right to say that.""

""Yes, Ser'ent-Major."" Laroy looked properly chastised.

""Fuck-outta-my-sight, Corporal."" O'Brien glared at the rest of the bridge as Laroy left. ""Am I the only one with job to do around here?""

The squads were very quiet on the way back to Homeplate, with O'Brien's anger hanging over the bridge like a cloud. Once they'd been dismissed, Gryzzk cleared his throat.

""Sergeant Major, if you could stay behind for a moment - I'd like to review some items from the exercise today.""

O'Brien nodded as the rest of the bridge team filed out as quickly as (in)humanly possible - it seemed as if the squads were in a hurry to reach minimum safe distance.

After the doors closed, Gryzzk got a cup of tea and settled casually. ""Sergeant Major, I have a confession of sorts. I had Rosie listen in on the last conference for me.""

O'Brien rubbed the back of her head. ""Ah. So what's the question?""

""I have two - the first one is 'Why?' It doesn't make a great deal of sense from my perspective.""

""Ah. Well, one of the reasons I selected Laroy is he's psych-tough. He can handle what I'm throwing in his face and he knows it's a bit of theater for the others. After we go to the conference room, we go over the real stuff for a minute, and then kill time - keep the rest of them on their toes.""

""Does this actually work?"" Gryzzk sipped at his tea, thoughtfully.

""Well, see for yourself."" O'Brien manipulated her tablet, throwing a few charts on the main display. ""Every metric - reaction time, accuracy, comm clarity - ramped up. Now one thing you'll note here is the diminishing returns."" O'Brien highlighted a portion of the graph. ""There's a natural ceiling with stuff like this. After that folks just shut down and tune out the yelling because what they think is their best isn't gonna save them. So if you're planning on putting a tactical shouting match in your toolkit, make sure your target knows to play their part and use it sparingly.""

""Understood. Lunch tomorrow?""

""Wouldn't miss Grezzk's corned beef hash for the world.""

""I'm also going to be inviting Reilly and Lomeia.""

""Looking to see if you can figure out if they're handing you a grenade wrapped in creds?""

""Something like that."" Gryzzk shrugged. ""Plus seeing if we can navigate the minefield of Lomeia joining the Clan.""

""I'll leave that in your capable fuzzy hands, sir.""

The next morning was an early one. The children were placed in the care of the Clanmothers while the adults went to medical, where the doctors were waiting along with Chief Tucker. Tucker was fussing over the hand itself, while Doc Cottle was deep in discussion with Other Doc Cottle regarding a holographic projection of Kiole's nervous system.

The gentle-looking woman with silver hair highlighted an area. ""Here?""

There was a nod in return. ""Looks about as good as any.""

Meanwhile, Tucker was running a final diagnostic on the hand itself. It had been imaged from Kiole's hand - and it was disturbing to see in a way. The lack of fur and odd scent were making themselves known. He gave Gryzzk a harrumph of sorts.

""Major. Ship's ready, evening crew's ready, hand's ready, and if you ever ask me to do an in-system jump again, the other options better suck.""

Gryzzk nodded. ""I will make sure that's the case, Chief. Lieutenant Nhoot will give you a hug for your efforts.""

There was a harrumph of sorts. ""You play dirty, Major.""

""On occasion.""

A slight throat-clearing signaled the readiness of the two doctors to begin their work. Kiole placed her forearm on the table, apprehension deep within her scent. Both Grezzk and Gryzzk leaned into her, massaging Kiole's shoulders and back and the procedure began.

First, a numbing agent was injected, and then a thick-looking needle was inserted, followed by several others as the two doctors each manipulated controls to implant the necessary sensors and leads required. After, a small ring was grafted to Kiole's forearm, and then finally the hand itself. It was an odd thing to see on several levels. The lack of fur was disconcerting, but the other part that was odd was that it had a pulse of sorts. It was almost a perfect replication of a living hand.

Finally the procedure was done, and Kiole slowly began to move her new hand and fingers, pure joy radiating as she looked at it and her brain began to register sensations from a limb long gone. She lifted the hand to look at it for a long time, testing the movement of each finger. She then looked at Gryzzk and touched his face with her new hand, before repeating the gesture with her wife.

Tears rolled down her face unbidden as she whispered her amazement. ""I can feel your face. I can *feel* it. Soft.""

After a few minutes, Other Doc Cottle tilted her head slightly to ha-hem a soft interruption. ""Now then, we'd like to check various degrees of control.""

Kiole nodded, going through the various tests with a child's enthusiasm. It wasn't perfect at first, as Kiole dropped several items and broke a stylus. But after an hour, they went home with care instructions. Kiole was almost giddy with excitement.

""I just...I never knew. This. It's amazing."" She took Gryzzk's hand in hers as they walked from medical to their quarters. ""Your hand is warm. Gentle..."" her voice trailed off and she stopped for a moment to weep into their shoulders as the three held each other.

They collected the children and went home for their next engagement - lunch. The normal dining table had to be extended to accommodate the four guests. The twins settled in their bassinet and gurgled happily at the scents weaving to and fro as the slowly-becoming-traditional departure lunch of Vilantian corned beef hash made it's way to the table. The gravity was dialed to ship-standard as the doorbell rang and all four of their guests came through the door en masse.

Grezzk was bemused by the rush, shooing everyone to the couches and chairs. ""A bit - it's not quite ready yet.""

There was a motion from Reilly to Gryzzk and then Lomeia as a silent question was asked, and Gryzzk finally took note of a newer thing. The inside of Lomeia's wrist was shaved, and her scent was nervousness as she walked up and gave a slight headlift as she stood in front of first Kiole, then Grezzk, and lastly she opened her hand to present a lock of her fur to Gryzzk. Certainly it was far less dramatic than previous clan-joinings, but no less emotional as Gryzzk placed his hand over Lomeia's and turned it over to let the snippet fall from her hand to his. The newest addition to the clanfur was placed with it and rewrapped with care, after which the entire gathering wrapped Lomeia into a large hug - even the O'Briens loomed over the outside of the group protectively wrapped around the knot of family.

After a few minutes of quiet whispers they family slowly disengaged from each other and began to resettle, with the scent being one of joyful relaxation.

Gro'zel had a serious look on her face that was her ""deep thought"" face.

""Yes, little one?"" Gryzzk knew that this was going to be interesting.

""So. Miss Lomeia's part of the clan now. And Miss Reilly's part of the family now. Are you gonna find a husband for them now?""

""Ehm...I will trust them to guard their hearts.""

Gro'zel pouted softly. ""But they're so happy together. They should be married.""

""I do not disagree, little one. But that is not something for me to order. Now come, we have food that deserves our attention.""

At the mention of food, Gro'zel brightened and set the serious thoughts aside. ""Okay Papa!"" The words were barely out of her mouth before she ran to collect Nhoot and herd her sister to the table.

The lunch was excellent with the O'Briens tucking away a great deal and everyone else eating ravenously. Kiole tried using her right hand and gave up after bending two forks into a U-shape. Gryzzk paused for a moment and considered how somehow the departure lunch and the return dinner were becoming traditional feasts, of a sort.

Afterward, they retired to the living room, with Reilly taking a corner and pulling Lomeia in front of her - almost as if Lomeia was a shield or something akin to an emotional support shotgun.

Gryzzk went to the holo-projector, selecting a gentle classic instrumental for the background. Reilly's unease was not hard to miss, and she was taking a few deep breaths before saying anything.

""So...yeah. I was pretty happy with being invited, 'cause I wanted to let you know a little about my parents and...well, me."" Reilly's eyes never stopped moving, flicking about like prey looking for the danger that was coming.

""In your own time, Sergeant."" Gryzzk took a deliberately casual position that caused his inner Lead Servant to shriek and depart to find something to clean.

""Well, it's like this. My parents are...well, they do this every year. Like they're not so much hiring the Legion as they're hiring me, because they've never given up on their plan for me.""

""Their plan?""

""Yeah. Like, I'm their third kid, and the only daughter. Just like they planned. They got the heir, the spare, and the princess. Artificially gestated, of course - Delia would never be caught wearing maternity clothes, and stretch marks? Fuggedaboudit. Of course, I also had in-tank tutoring as soon as I had a nervous system; art, musical theory, literature, all the stuff a growing zygote needs in addition to some gene-splicing. I was supposed to be living art - Delia and Charles can analyze and scout all day long, but neither of them can create anything. So they threw a good chunk of their creds into making three perfect children.""

Reilly took a swig of her wine. ""At the end of it all I got decanted, and fast-forward five years and I wasn't turning out the way I was supposed to, because genetic manipulation isn't the perfect science they want you to think it is. According to my spec-sheet I was going to be a five-foot-ten-inch waif, and I wasn't trending that way. So they took me to the doctor and forgot that they'd made me smart enough to figure out that normal and me weren't exactly friends. After some tests, they got a settlement and I got eight years of being told I could still be something despite the tragedy. I mean, I'm okay at art stuff, but I wasn't the prodigy they were hoping for. So they went to plan B, marrying me to someone who was an artist and being an artistic muse. So for eight years I got lessons in social graces, small talk, and high society survival - plus an allowance that I could spend on whatever.""

""I saved most of it starting around the time I was twelve because I'd caught a documentary about space mercenaries and...well, it was the furthest thing from Anchiano I'd ever seen. I mean, they were close in a way I'd never seen."" Reilly shifted slightly, wrapping her legs around Lomeia. ""I wanted that. Enough to squirrel away creds and start pretending to be interested in education - and that was when I started being rebellious. Dyed my hair in last year's colors, wore knockoff designer clothes, learned to override the locks so I could sneak out at night, kept cats around because Delia was allergic. Turned sixteen, met several guys and gals and found out just how much fun I could have, then spent a fourth of my creds on a lawyer to file for emancipation, another fourth on a roundabout ticket to New Casa, and then another fourth on a new ident, scratchin' out the name they thought I should have and putting in Jenassa."" She paused for a moment. ""I always liked it for some reason, and Edwards got a kick out of it when I met her at Ricks. We clicked, I liked her shirt, asked where I could get one like it and signed on the next day.""

During this, everyone had slowly migrated on the couch to form a pile of fur around Reilly as she absently stroked Lomeia's ears. ""So that's the sad backstory; once they figured out where I was they tried a bunch of legal means to get me back under their 'care'. The lawyer I'd hired filed everything, made sure it was legit and then fucked off to retire on Terra - then they tried to get the 7th de-chartered, and when that didn't work they decided the 7th could be useful. So every year they hire whatever ship I'm with for an art tour and several weeks of marriage interviews."" There was a snort. ""Apparently they're still hoping for a return on investment.""

""So what can we expect?"" Gryzzk leaned forward slightly, anticipating what was next.

""Barely disguised insults about everything, gentle reminders to me how everything is so much better at the colony and at least two pirate attacks because they're so wrapped up in their own world that they forget that not all their social followers are law-abiding citizens.""

""Well, I suppose we'll have to have caches set up for resupply.""

""I'd recommend it. Anything else?""

Gryzzk looked to Lomeia. ""You knew this?""

His reply was a nod. ""She made me promise not to tell, Freelord. That it was her story.""

Gryzzk nodded. ""Then it will remain her story."" He glanced around to see the nods of agreement. ""I will see you all tomorrow, but this evening I should like some time with my wives and children.""

It took a fairly long time for the room to actually clear out, as everyone wanted one more hug or forehead-touch, but finally the house was empty. Or as empty as a place with three adults and four children could be.

As Gryzzk settled on the couch, Grezzk and Kiole curled up to warm his side. Kiole broke the silence once she finished examining her artificial hand thoroughly.

""If they were both from Hurdop, they would already be married and looking for a husband. We should inquire if they haven't.""

**Why This Pick?**

It’s tough to say “no” to an Over with Eduardo Rodriguez (7.05 ERA) on the mound for the Diamondbacks, friends. Rodriguez’s last 5 straight outings have resulted in game totals of at least 11 runs (4 out of 5 went well beyond this number…) In addition, the Reds have put 15 runs on the board in just their last 3 games, while the Diamondbacks have bagged 21 in their last 3. Between the Cincinnati & Arizona offenses, I think the Over will cash here pretty easily. My money’s on a high-scoring affair this evening.

1l4uj8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOwlHouse/comments/1l4uj8i/why_the_owl_house_is_a_bad_show/,Why The Owl House is a Bad Show,"I do not like The Owl House. It makes me recoil. At first, I liked it—I eagerly awaited each new episode. All those mysteries, Ida’s curse, Belos’s identity, and so on… But after taking a rational look at the series, I came to realize just how mediocre it is.  
  
Arguments like “The show was cut short, so you have no right to criticize it” just don’t work for me. A viewer shouldn’t have to come up with excuses for a product’s poor quality. I don’t care about the behind-the-scenes or the production process—I’m judging the final product.

Preface over, let’s begin.  
1. \*\*I don’t buy into this world, so I can’t get invested in the plot.\*\*

  
In the story, we supposedly have a dark totalitarian regime where anyone who doesn’t fit within the established rules is thrown in prison and then turned to stone. The prime law is the Ban on Wild Magic. Yet our main characters break nearly every existing rule—and face zero consequences. For example: Luz enrolls in a magic school, and the Headmaster just lets her and her friends study every form of magic they want. This is a school funded directly by the Emperor! And the Headmaster shows no concern that if the Imperial Coven suddenly inspected the school, they’d shut it down immediately. He’s also not bothered by the fact that breaking the Wild Magic ban could land him and these students in the Conformatorium. And isn’t the Headmaster supposed to believe that Wild Magic is dangerous? It’s as if Belos came to power yesterday and only just began his propaganda about Wild Magic’s dangers. Even if the Headmaster wanted his students to practice Wild Magic, fine—then at least have them do it in secret. But no! He takes these same students on a field trip to the Emperor’s palace. They don’t even bother changing out of their school uniforms, which clearly signal that they’re studying multiple types of magic!

In that same episode about the field trip, the heroes decide to steal one of the Emperor’s artifacts—and NOTHING happens to them. They openly criticize the Emperor on live broadcast—and NOTHING happens. They attack members of the Imperial Coven—and NOTHING happens. They’re seen hanging out with the realm’s biggest criminal—and NOTHING happens. Lilith goes against Belos—and STILL faces no repercussions. Moreover, she’s later hired to work at a museum, as if being branded an enemy of the people is no big deal. Wow—totalitarianism at its finest.  
That’s why I roll my eyes whenever the protagonists whine, “Life under Belos’s rule is awful” and how unfair his system is. BUT WE’VE ALREADY SEEN that if the heroes really wanted to, the world would instantly bend to their will. It’s everyone else who supposedly lives under a totalitarian regime, forced to adapt to its laws. But when it comes to the main cast, the world just reshapes itself around them. The only time the protagonists ever face any real consequences is near the end of Season 2, when they finally have to leave the Boiling Isles and hide from the guards. Do I even need to say that SHOULD’VE happened much earlier?

# 2. **Luz Noceda**

I hate this piece of garbage. Every time she’s on screen, I feel an uncontrollable hatred. This character doesn’t arouse a shred of sympathy in me. Because Luz is completely to blame for everything that happens to her. She’s literally the kind of person you tell, “Don’t go in there—it’ll eat you alive.” And she still goes in, gets wrecked, and then whines about it. Throughout the series, everyone tells her this world is dangerous, that humans don’t belong here. But she still chooses to stay. Fine if she’d ended up here by accident and couldn’t go home—like Anne in Amphibia. But no, she voluntarily stays in the Boiling Isles after being repeatedly warned how dangerous it is. That’s why I don’t give a damn about any attempt by the creators to make us pity her. I refuse to feel sorry for a dumbass who knowingly went somewhere she didn’t belong, got her ass handed to her, and now cries, “Oh, I’m so miserable and traumatized.” Her whining reaches its peak in Season 3, when Luz starts beating herself up because, indirectly, it’s her fault Belos found out about the Draining Spell—and this self-flagellation, begging the audience to feel sorry for her, doesn’t work at all. First, because of everything I already said. Second, Belos would’ve gone after the Collector anyway. Luz and Lilith played a minimal role in that. Or do you really think Philip wouldn’t have found another victim to distract the monster? Luz is just beating herself up for nothing, even though she’s committed plenty of other transgressions that she doesn’t feel the slightest guilt for! Which ones? Well… for example, that time this idiot started screaming and having a meltdown inside enemy territory. And the reason she ended up there is even more ridiculous. After King learned some pretty shocking facts about his origins, Luz decided it would be A GREAT IDEA to sneak into the Imperial Coven’s compound to steal ONE TOY to make King feel better. And she didn’t even think about the risks! Because King would immediately feel better if she got caught and executed! Which is exactly what happens. Give thanks to Luz and her stellar emotional control. And if it weren’t for a contrived plot miracle, Ida would’ve died because of Luz. AND OF COURSE Luz faces no repercussions for such a colossal screw-up. No punishment, no reprimand. Or take the time when Luz ditched King, even though she promised to spend that day with him, and went off partying with Willow and Gus. And at the end of the episode, they made King look like the bad guy. I think I’m starting to understand why she had no friends in her own world.

 2.1 \*\*How Luz’s Problems Are Presented\*\*

From the first episode all the way through Season 3, the show practically yells at us that Luz is this poor, miserable, misunderstood soul—”Nobody wants to understand or accept her.” Yet in the story, her weirdness really disrupts other people’s lives. In the very first episode, because of her irresponsibility, Luz accidentally frees a bunch of snakes, which then attack other students. But, of course, by the end of the episode, they frame it as not Luz being a stupid idiot, but rather “society just doesn’t want to accept her as she is—a stupid idiot.”

But the main issue is that Luz’s personality hurts not only everyone around her but herself as well. Luz is gullible. Way too gullible. She believes these random prisoners who claim they were locked up for no reason. It never even crosses her mind that they might be lying to trick her into freeing them. In that same episode, she agrees to stay the night with complete strangers. Because when you crash at the house of strangers who are wanted fugitives, you make new friends instead of waking up in an ice bath missing a couple of organs—that’s apparently the moral of this show. And let’s not forget the second episode, where Luz’s naiveté is finally slapped in her face and she’s forced to face reality. I might have even liked that episode if Luz hadn’t stepped on the same rake again, blindly trusting Philip and ignoring all of Lilith’s warnings. 

By the way, another reason I can’t sympathize with Luz in Season 3 is this: if you get deceived once, you’re unlucky. But if you get deceived twice, you’re an idiot. And I have zero desire to wipe the tears of an idiot. Back to that second episode— I did actually like how the show tried to deliver the message that Luz isn’t “the chosen one,” but that doesn’t mean she can’t become someone great. And it’s so sad to see how they completely ruined it. In the finale, it turns out Luz was, in fact, the Titan’s chosen one all along, and he’s been guiding her, teaching her glyph magic. They even give her the strongest, most special Palisman. Compared to Luz, Philip is far more inspiring. Everyone tried to hold him back—even the Titan himself tried to hide glyph magic from him. And yet, the guy still became the most powerful magician in the Boiling Isles, built his own empire, and even when they “killed” him, he survived and continued making everyone’s life miserable.

3. \*\*Magic\*\*

I actually like the way magic is divided in The Owl House—because it’s not just the usual elemental split. The whole coven system is genuinely interesting. Glyph magic, especially the use of drawing symbols to cast spells, also looks really cool. What isn’t cool is that the rules for how glyphs work keep changing every time. One moment you have to touch a glyph to activate it; the next, it triggers from a distance. Sometimes, to make a spell more powerful you must draw a larger symbol; other times, a tiny scrap of paper causes a massive explosion. But those are minor annoyances compared to one plot point I still don’t understand: why did Luz even need to attend the local magic school? I mean, how are they supposed to teach her glyph magic if none of them knows anything about glyphs themselves? It’s like going up to a French teacher and saying, “Teach me Mandarin.” Throughout the series, we see Luz learning everything about new glyphs and combinations on her own. In other words, that school serves no purpose for her—she probably just goes there to hang out with her friends more often.

And going back to Luz being allowed to learn multiple types of magic: surely the school has a curriculum that follows the “one student—one coven” rule. That would mean Luz can’t really study even one discipline properly, because she’d literally have to be in several places at once. Their education system doesn’t even account for learning multiple magical disciplines. Unless, of course, the world once again bends to Luz’s will and the school completely reworks its schedule and curriculum in a matter of days? ;)

 3.1 \*\*Edalyn and her magic\*\*. To me, one of the clearest examples of sloppy magic mechanics is Edalyn. All she does is flaunt the fact that she hasn’t joined any coven and can use multiple types of magic at once. But when it comes to an actual battle, the most creative she and the writers can manage is basic fireballs and teleportation bursts. By the way, which coven does fireball magic belong to? And teleportation?

Where are the unique combinations of covens that I expected to see? Even the students in the Basilisk episode were coming up with more creative mash-ups than our “Miss Strongest Witch.” That’s why I felt nothing when Edalyn got the Bard Coven mark—because I never saw her make full use of the Wild Magic she supposedly had.  
4. \*\*Character Relationships\*\*

\*\*4.1 Edalyn and the Boiling Isles\*\*

What also bothers me about Edalyn is how she interacts with the Boiling Isles. Supposedly, she’s the most wanted criminal in the realm, with a huge bounty on her head. But as the series goes on, you completely forget about that, because our “Most Wanted Criminal” casually sells her wares at the local market—and she’s only ever been chased down twice at most. Wouldn’t it make more sense if Edalyn sold her goods on the black market? Over the entire show, only two (maybe three) characters even tried to betray her. The rest of the time, she just strolls through public spaces—like the local magic school—without anyone even thinking, “Hey, let’s report her to the Imperial Coven and claim that reward.” And if Edalyn were truly the most dangerous, wanted criminal, the Imperial Coven would have hauled her off to the Conformatorium ages ago. There’s nothing stopping them from gathering a big squad and raiding her house.

\*\*4.2 Edalyn and Lilith\*\*

Still, Edalyn is one of my favorite characters in the show, and she has really strong arcs and conflicts. The main one, of course, is her Curse and how she learns to live with it—gradually accepting that part of herself. I genuinely appreciate that, in the end, she doesn’t just get rid of the curse and reclaim her old powers. It’s one of the few mature storytelling choices in the series. But… why can’t Edalyn just cast spells with her staff? Luz, a human, had no trouble using a Palisman that didn’t belong to her. Or does staff magic get distorted, too? If so, they should have shown us that—right now, the characters look like fools who just whine about being helpless instead of trying the most obvious solution. But that’s just a sidebar.

I also love how the Owl Beast affected Edalyn’s relationship with her family, and I generally enjoy the episodes featuring Edalyn’s parents. And I like the way the Clawthorne sisters’ arc begins, especially Lilith. I particularly appreciate that the series doesn’t paint Lilith as a one-dimensional villain, but it also doesn’t absolve her or shift the blame onto someone else. Lilith’s actions were horrible, and Edalyn is right to be angry with her sister; at the same time, Lilith sincerely regrets what she did and spends the rest of the series trying to make amends. That gives us a solid, mature conflict. But! But! BUT—but but but—where is the resolution to that conflict? Because after the Gwen episode, Lilith simply disappears from the storyline and only appears in a couple of episodes that don’t advance her arc with Edalyn.

So, my little viewer, were you excited about a new character joining the main cast, hoping for fresh dynamics, new conflicts, and interesting interactions within the heroes’ group? Well, tough luck.

In the end, we never get a clear resolution to that conflict. I still have no idea whether Edalyn has fully forgiven Lilith or if she’s still mad at her. And speaking of Edalyn, she basically has no proper interactions or arcs with any other characters anymore.

\*\*4.3 Edalyn and Luz\*\*

Luz’s very presence puts a damper on things. But even objectively: why did Edalyn let Luz live in her house? Luz helps Edalyn with her business in exactly one episode. Every other time, she’s either in the way or just freeloading off Edalyn. Maybe Edalyn took Luz in because she wants to pass all her magical knowledge to her? Edalyn only formally trains Luz in two episodes—and even then, she does so begrudgingly before dumping her off at that ill-fated school.

\*\*4.4 Edalyn and King’s Relationship\*\*

Here’s another duo of main characters. And maybe I missed something, but when exactly did King go from being Edalyn’s funny neighbour to her adopted—damn—son?! In Season 1, I never noticed any parent-child dynamic between those two.

(And a brief aside: I do like King’s arc in Season 2, when he stops being a sidekick and becomes a fully developed character, grappling with the realization that he’s basically a demigod in this world)

But Edalyn, in Season 2, basically transforms from a cool, independent woman into a doting mother figure for nearly every kid in the show. I wouldn’t even be this upset if the series itself didn’t claim to be “unconventional,” “breaking stereotypes”—all while turning a badass grandma into… well, just another maternal character. Sigh. Apparently, a female character can only be a motherly figure or else be miserable over her partner.

\*\*4.5 **Edalyn and Raine’s Relationship**\*\*

The romantic drama between these two drives me nuts for a few reasons. First, by introducing this subplot, they completely abandoned the Clawthorne sisters’ conflict. Second, Raine feels like a mere function. Their role is to be the “revolutionary” character, and I can’t bring myself to call Edalyn and Raine’s relationship a “good romance” when one of them exists only to serve a narrative purpose. The problem is that the show never properly explains why they turned against Belos. I mean, we’re told that when Raine began teaching at the Bard Coven, they discovered that the Emperor was forcefully recruiting students, and anyone who refused “disappeared.” Okay… so am I supposed to believe they rebelled against Belos simply because he’s coercing witches into covens? Even though Belos never tried to hide that fact! 😂 He literally conducts public executions on live broadcast! But Raine talks about it as if they only just found out once they were in Imperial service. And shouldn’t Raine have accepted this as normal after years of brainwashing about the dangers of Wild Magic? Apparently not. It’s Schrödinger’s propaganda—both there and not there at the same time.

I could have bought it if Raine opposed Belos because of Edalyn—like, “After getting to know her, I realized all the rumors about Wild Magic are bullshit, that wild witches are decent people.” But nope! There’s not a single mention of Edalyn influencing them. Their only stated motivation is, “Well… I just don’t like that the Emperor is forcing people to join covens 😢.”

\*\*4.6 Belos and Raine\*\*

Speaking of Raine and Belos, I’m just upset about all the wasted potential here. Think about it: Raine and Belos share exactly ONE—just one!—scene together. The show’s ideological rival to the antagonist barely interacts with antagonist. There’s zero ideological confrontation, zero clash of ideals—nothing.

  
Moving on to some hot takes and pairings. First of all, I want to point out that this show has a downright unhealthy obsession with turning EVERY single—emphasis on EVERY—duo of characters into romantic partners. Obviously, characters can’t simply be friends, allies, or soulmates. No, it absolutely has to become romance, even where it makes zero sense. It feels like they tack it on just to pander to fans and shippers. And every pairing in The Owl House follows the exact same formula: the “cool sigma woman” and the omega who blushes at every glance she gives them. Okay, I’m exaggerating a bit—sometimes both characters literally turn red as tomatoes. But let’s go one by one. First up: The Boss Of This Gym.

**4.7 Lumity**

Lumity drives me up the wall. First, it’s teenage melodrama**.** And Lumity themselves are so saccharine-sweet that it makes my teeth hurt. Second, I hate how their relationship even started and what they did to Amity. Luz decides to make the first move on Amity not because she’s recognized any of Amity’s good qualities, but simply because the character in her favorite book, Azura, also “befriended her enemy.” So, why shouldn’t Luz do the same? It’s important to note that before this, Amity was bullying Luz’s friend Willow—pretty harshly, too. But Luz didn’t care! That’s why she tries to befriend the person who has been actively ruining her friend’s life—well, most of it, anyway. Anyone surprised Luz had no friends in the human world? 

Then, in that same episode, Luz royally screws up by reading Amity’s diary, helping Edric and Emira mess with her, and on top of it, ruining Amity’s favorite storybook hero—who nearly kills those two. After that episode, Amity suddenly gets a crush on Luz. But after everything that happened, their relationship should have been, at best, neutral. Nope.

“B-b-but Luz helped Amity defeat that monster!” Oh wow, what a hero—Luz decided to clean up the mess she literally caused herself. Give her a medal. After that, in subsequent episodes, Amity starts getting anxious around Luz, even when Luz isn’t even there. Meanwhile, our ditzy girl keeps messing up and putting Amity’s life in danger. And this isn’t one of those “hero in peril because of circumstances” moments—Luz is just doing stupid, reckless stuff because she’s obviously an idiot. Like in the episode where she decided to steal Amity’s magical wand. Not borrow it. Not ask permission. She straight-up snatched it, and surprise, surprise, the Blight siblings and Edalyn almost died because of it. So yeah, Amity, that’s definitely the person you should be worrying about in Season 2—and you’re terrified of messing up around her? Where did your Season 1 pride go? Where’s even a shred of self-respect?

And after that, Amity herself falls under the “main character’s sidekick” curse and becomes just an accessory to Luz. Most of Amity’s conflicts end up tied back to this protozoan. Her fight with her parents boils down to Luz—particularly that episode about her dad, which should have focused entirely on just those two. Instead, Luz and her problems get shoehorned in.

\*\*4.8 Amity and Willow’s Relationship\*\*

The only conflict of Amity’s that wasn’t tied to Luz was her friendship with Willow, which she was forced to sacrifice because of her parents. At first, I was intrigued. Until I really thought about this arc. The problems start all the way in Season 1, when supposedly “good” Amity—who still apparently cares about Willow—just randomly starts picking on her. In the woods. Completely alone. Where no one could see. With no need to play the “mean girl” role.

Then we jump to Season 2, where we get a big hint that Willow is still angry at Amity and hasn’t fully forgiven her—and honestly, I understand. You can’t just forgive years of bullying in one conversation. But in the next episode about the two of them, that whole forgiveness conflict just gets dropped—period. Instead, we get a brand-new conflict where Amity can’t accept that Willow has grown stronger and doesn’t need protection anymore.

Excuse me, but what the hell? WHERE, I mean literally WHERE, was there any hint of this before? It might have worked if Amity had previously had to protect Willow from Boscha’s harassment. But nothing like that happened. Blight didn’t give a damn that Boscha terrorized Willow and her precious Luz all day. And then Willow’s character development does a complete 180, and in Season 3’s second episode, they just shove in our faces that Willow is anxious now because she “feels responsible for her friends.” But… how? Where did that come from? I don’t recall one moment where Willow ever took on the role of the “mom” for the group.

4.9 **Willow x Hunter**

From what I’ve seen, this is the third most popular ship in The Owl House. And I’m 99% sure the writers only threw in a romance between them to appease the fans. Because Hunter starts catching feelings for Willow *just like that*—with the snap of a finger. One episode they barely meet, and in the next? He’s already blushing around her.

And once again, I ask: why can’t these two just be *friends* or *allies*?  
—""Because the stans and shippers will cry! 😢""

Also, honestly? Hunter is just not in a place mentally or emotionally to be in a relationship. The guy has the social skills of a stale piece of bread. He seriously needs to figure himself out before even *thinking* about romance.

5. \*\*Characters\*\*

\*\*5.1 Hunter.\*\*

Best. Character. In the whole show. I absolutely love him. His turn to the good side feels natural, well-paced, and actually makes sense. And he’s probably the *only* character who truly seems shaped by Belos’s rule. Which makes him feel like an actual *resident* of the Boiling Isles—not some tourist who just arrived yesterday and learned how things work. 

But, of course, Season 3 had to ruin my boy too. He starts off the season as little more than an punching bag and a tool to farm pity from the audience. 

And seriously—Hunter survived in the wild, he’s one of the Emperor’s most trusted scouts... but *this* same guy decides to poke a weird goo with the exact finger that has an open wound? Mister “I survived the Coven's deadliest trials” apparently learned *nothing* about basic hygiene or self-preservation. Incredible. 🤦‍♀️

And don’t even get me started on the wasted potential of his conflict with Belos. The Golden Guard had the *strongest* emotional connection to the show’s main villain. But in the finale, he basically gets reduced to a background character and becomes just another one of Luz’s quirky buddies. 😔

Like come *on*, this guy had every reason to want a showdown with Belos.  
—“Nah, that’d be too compelling. Let’s have Hunter help Willow with *her* issues instead, and then just forget he had any unresolved rage or trauma. ;)”

5.2 \*\*Gus\*\*

And finally, a few words about the last member of Luz’s squad.  
Gus is a useless, plot-convenient, Mary-Sue-adjacent character whose OP powers and out-of-nowhere emotional conflict just *magically appear*. 😡

In the episode with the head of the Illusion Coven, we suddenly find out Gus has insane magical powers that activate during emotional distress.  
Cool, right?  
Then *where* the hell were these powers earlier?!

Like, a bully made fun of him as a kid? Instant depression, I am ghoul 1000-7.  
But when he and his friends were nearly *murdered* back in Season 1? No biggie 🙂, no magical outbursts there!

Oh, and remember the time Gus was tied up in the middle of the forest? Apparently not stressful enough for our little Sue-boy.  
But when the Illusion Coven guy *grabs his wrist*?  
Boom. Full-blown emotional meltdown and the most massive illusion we’ve ever seen. Even the coven head couldn’t fight it off.

And this whole “Gus is obsessed with human culture” angle?  
It’s just dumb.  
The Boiling Isles *are* basically our world but with a magic filter slapped on. The mentality and behavior of witches and humans aren’t even that different!

So yeah—screw Gus. Absolutely useless character. Trash-tier.

\*\*4.10 Vee and Luz’s Relationship\*\*

Am I really the *only one* who finds the whole doppelgänger situation with Luz *creepy as hell*?  
Actually, no. It *is* creepy. Just think about it — some freak shows up, steals your identity, and starts living with your mom, pretending to be *you*. And Vee even brazenly throws Luz’s stuff out on the street. 

So yeah, Luz has every right to be mad. And she *is* mad! For, like, the first two minutes... and then just *forgets* that Vee stole her entire identity. Same with Camila — she doesn’t even care that a total stranger impersonated her daughter and lived in her house on her dime.  
—“But Vee has a tragic backstory! 🥺”  
Don’t care. Literally do not care.

Since when is a sad backstory a get-out-of-jail-free card for *actual crimes*?  
Because yes, identity theft *is* a crime. But nobody holds Vee accountable. Luz doesn’t bring it up again, Camila shrugs it off, and the writers pretend it’s fine. I hate when characters face *zero* consequences for their actions.

5.3 **Emperor Belos a.k.a. Philip Wittebane**

Honestly, I only started watching The Owl House because of this guy. In Season 1, he’s genuinely terrifying—a ruthless tyrant shrouded in mystery, and you can’t wait to learn his secrets.

I realized Belos was human the moment he appeared on screen. In the very first episode, we see a barrier that only *humans* can pass, and that barrier is maintained by the Imperial Coven. So why in the world would Belos build a barrier he himself can’t get through?

Plus, the fact that Belos is human gives him an emotional link to the main heroine. Both are ordinary humans, both ended up in a magical world, and both learned magic despite having no innate talent. But the creators went way overboard with those parallels and turned Belos into as big an idiot as Luz. He screws up in tiny ways—like, “Why in the heck did you not even *search* Edalyn when you captured her?”—and in colossal ways, too, because this moron doesn’t realize that the gigantic heart inside his castle—which was literally built in the chest of a Titan—*is* the Titan’s own heart. When you were constructing your castle, did you honestly think that heart was just a decoration, some flamboyant set dressing?

if Belos had realized what it was, he could’ve merged with the heart way earlier and wiped out the witches.

A prime example of the writers’ “I don’t care about my own story” attitude is Belos’s entire backstory—and how it was presented. It… wasn’t. We get a rushed, three-line summary of his past from Masha, plus a few images in the background. Yeah, I get that “visual storytelling” is a thing, but it doesn’t work like this—where the audience is supposed to piece together the villain’s entire backstory from a bunch of overheard exposition and random background snaps. But apparently, the creators think that’s fine, because they pulled the same stunt twice. Even after gathering all these fragments, we still don’t have answers to the big questions: Why did Philip kill his brother, whom he’d traveled to another dimension to save? Because he was a mindless fanatic who assumed his brother was “corrupted”? Why didn’t Caleb end up as fanatic as Philip? Why did these two brothers, raised in the same environment, have completely different views on witches?

—“Well, the runtime got cut!”—I don’t care. I really don’t. And the kicker is that, even with a shorter runtime, they still wasted precious minutes on junk we didn’t need. Can someone explain to me: did we *need* the arc where Luz and Amity hunt down the author of the Azura books? Or the arc where Edalyn whips up a truth serum? Hell, they could’ve devoted the entire second episode to unraveling the main villain’s mystery. But, dear viewer, pucker up and cry into your coffee. Instead, you get side-character arcs and Willow’s plotline, which is stitched on with white thread. And Belos’s downfall in Season 3—do I even need to mention it? mean, at least they didn’t piss on his corpse. I guess that’s something.

5.4 **The Collector**

You know what grinds my gears? How *everyone* constantly baby-talks this overpowered brat instead of just putting him in his place.

Take, for example, Episode 3: the Collector forces Luz and Edalyn to play all those deadly games.

And what does King do?  
Instead of using his magic on the Collector, he just stands there, watching him torture the two people he cares about most. I honestly don’t understand why King didn’t do *anything* during that Weirdmageddon and just let the Collector run rampant. It wasn’t like Luz had been gone for just a few hours—he was gone for who knows how long. Or maybe King remembered “First-Season King” and actually *enjoyed* seeing the Boiling Isles’ citizens suffer.

And I hate excuses like “But he’s just a kid—he doesn’t understand death, so feel sorry for him 😢.” First, this “kid” is hundreds of years old, and the show never says Archivists age or understand things more slowly than humans. Second, I don’t believe for a second that the Collector, after spending time with Philip, still didn’t grasp the concept of death—especially since titans were wiped out *in his presence* and he knew about the Draining Spell. Third, since when is ignorance an excuse? It’s hilarious how that logic works. The Collector and Belos are two sides of the same coin—both think they’re doing good, that their actions are perfectly justifiable. But we brand one as the embodiment of evil while cuddling and pitying the other.

# **6. Other**

A few minor nitpicks:

1. Why are Belos’s soldiers so utterly useless? I get that they’re supposed to be cannon-fodder for the heroes, but then why trumpet the fact that “only the toughest can survive the Coven’s trials”? Because I have a sneaking suspicion Belos just hires them through a “Help Wanted” sign.
2. When exactly did Darius and Eberwolf join the Resistance? If it was *before* Edalyn’s requiem episode, then why did Raine and Edalyn try to kill them? If it was *after*, how on earth did Raine convince them to betray the Emperor?
3. Collector magic never works on titans… except in all those scenes where it suddenly does.
4. That time-travel episode feels like a hasty attempt to plug the plot hole of why Belos didn’t just kill Luz at the end of Season 1. “Well, he knew she had to go back in time and help him find the Collector.” But then he also had no problem sending Lilith to the scaffold, even though *her* presence was also crucial for his plan. And he shouldn’t even remember what Luz and Lilith look like—he last saw them decades ago when they were just pawns in his game. Or does Belos really have a perfect memory for every single person he’s ever used? That’s some freaky recall.

# Bottom Line

*The Owl House* is terrible. Yes, it has a few strong points, but they all drown in a sea of flaws. I understand why the show became so popular, but I can’t say it deserves that popularity.

Let’s cut through the hype\. You’ve seen the Instagram posts—white sand beaches\, sunsets over laptops\, cocktails in hand\. It looks like paradise\. But let me tell you something they don’t show you\: paradise comes with a price tag\. And it’s steep\.

The illusion of freedom is just that—an illusion\. Sure\, you’re not tied down to an office\, but what you gain in flexibility\, you lose in stability\. You start to believe that every day should be better than the last\, that every destination should outshine the previous one\. And when it doesn’t\? That’s when the pressure begins\.

You wake up in Bali\, then move to Chiang Mai\, then Lisbon\, then Tbilisi\. Each city is beautiful\, each experience unique\. But somewhere along the way\, you realize you haven’t built anything\. Not really\. Just a string of checkmarks on a map and a growing list of unanswered emails\.

Here’s the thing\: loneliness isn’t just a side effect—it’s a full\-blown epidemic among digital nomads\. You’re surrounded by people\, yes\, but they’re all passing through too\. No one wants to commit to a real relationship because they’re all chasing the same dream\. You end up in group chats that dissolve after a week\, in coworking spaces where no one remembers your name\.

And don’t even get me started on the cost\. Airfare\, accommodation\, food\, coffee\, and Wi\-Fi add up faster than you think\. You convince yourself that this is an investment in freedom\, but eventually\, you realize you’re just running on a treadmill—spending money to stay in motion\, with nothing to show for it\.

The mirage of productivity is another trap\. You think working from a beach resort will make you more creative\, more efficient\. But what happens when the waves distract you\? When the barista keeps bringing you coconut water\? You start to measure success by how many places you’ve been\, not by how much value you’ve created\.

Routines crumble like sandcastles\. One day you’re up at dawn\, writing and planning\. The next\, you’re asleep until noon\, surviving on takeout and Netflix\. Without a consistent schedule\, your goals blur into a haze of half\-finished projects and unmet promises\.

There’s also the pressure to perform\. Every post you make\, every video you upload\, every client you pitch—it all has to look perfect\. You’re not just selling your services\; you’re selling a lifestyle\. And that’s exhausting\. You start to feel like you have to be everywhere at once\: engaging on social media\, networking with other nomads\, hustling for clients\, and still pretending to enjoy the view\.

Communities form\, yes—but they’re often temporary\. You build bonds\, only to watch them fade as people move on\. And with no deep roots\, you start to wonder who you are outside of the role you play\. Are you a writer\? A designer\? A content creator\? Or are you just someone trying to avoid the real world\?

Decision fatigue sets in quickly\. Where do you go next\? What do you charge\? Should you freelance or start your own business\? Every choice feels monumental\, and soon\, indecision becomes your default state\. You stop trusting your instincts because there’s no benchmark to measure against\.

Stagnation creeps in when you lose sight of your purpose\. You become a tourist of your own life\, hopping from one location to the next without ever asking why\. You start to crave novelty just for the sake of it\, not because it serves any greater goal\.

Comparison is another silent killer\. You see someone else making six figures from their blog\, and suddenly you feel like a failure\. You scroll through feeds of people living in villas and buying luxury cars\, and you wonder if you’re doing it wrong\. But here’s the truth\: everyone’s journey is different\. And not everyone’s story ends with a tropical paradise\.

_🧭 Don\'t waste another minute guessing your earning potential\. Discover the facts now in under 90 seconds\!_ [Take the Test](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)

Your identity starts to unravel\. You’re not from anywhere\. You don’t belong to anyone\. And that’s terrifying\. You begin to question who you are when you’re not traveling\, when you’re not posting\, when you’re not performing\. You start to fear returning home because you’re afraid you won’t fit in anymore\.

Long\-term planning becomes a joke\. You can’t sign a lease\, you can’t commit to a project\, you can’t even plan your week\. Everything is fluid\, and that fluidity leaves you vulnerable\. You start to realize that without structure\, your ambitions are just dreams waiting to die\.

Legal and logistical challenges pile up\. Visas\, taxes\, insurance\, healthcare—all of it adds layers of complexity that you didn’t anticipate\. You thought this would be easy\, but the reality is messy\. And when you least expect it\, a bureaucratic snafu can derail everything\.

Relationships suffer too\. Friends fall off the radar\, family grows distant\, and love stories end before they begin\. Distance isn’t just physical—it’s emotional\. And when you’re always moving\, you leave behind pieces of yourself that never get put back together\.

The environmental impact is another elephant in the room\. You may be chasing freedom\, but you’re contributing to a global problem\. Flights\, hotels\, disposable products—it all leaves a mark\. And while some argue that sustainable travel is possible\, the truth is\, it’s rarely the priority when you’re focused on the next adventure\.

_🎯 Don’t settle for a life of uncertainty\. Find out exactly what you’re worth as a digital nomad in under 90 seconds\!_ [Check It Out](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)

Mental health is the final casualty\. Isolation\, stress\, and burnout become your companions\. You start to question if the trade\-off is even worth it\. And when you finally break down\, there’s no safety net\. No therapist nearby\, no friends to lean on\, no familiar streets to walk\.

Cultural sensitivity is another minefield\. You visit a country\, snap some photos\, write a post\, and call it a day\. But in doing so\, you risk exploiting the very places you claim to love\. Short stays breed superficial connections\, and sometimes\, those connections cause harm\.

Returning home is harder than you think\. After years of freedom\, the idea of a fixed address feels like a cage\. You resist\, you fight\, you push back\. But deep down\, you know you’re running away from something\. Maybe it’s not the life you imagined after all\.

Intentionality is key\. Most digital nomads fail not because they lack talent\, but because they lack purpose\. You can’t keep going in circles forever\. At some point\, you have to ask yourself\: what am I building\? What am I creating\? What legacy am I leaving behind\?

So\, before you book your next flight\, pause\. Reflect\. Ask yourself if this is what you truly want—or if you’re just following a script written by someone else\. Because the downside of being a digital nomad isn’t just the obvious ones\. It’s the quiet erosion of who you are\, piece by piece\, until you’re left with nothing but a suitcase and a few blurry memories\.

Like is this something gen Zs are bringing back? More importantly, now that Old Apartment Chick has gifted her a necklace, will Carrie reciprocate with a present equally as hideous as the purse she gave Louise from St. Louis?
* ""What's with all the drama...and the big Charlotte eyes?"" 💀 Those eyes are an entirely independent character on the show at this point.
* So now Carrie thinks if she writes in the 3rd person and changes the setting to 1846, no one will know she's written a novel about her messy life.
* Greeting a squirrel and fancying yourself Cinderella - then immediately being thrust into the role of Pied Piper - is WILD. Carrie's reaction was about 1/1000th what mine would've been. They would've had to hospitalize me.
* Let me get this straight. Aidan originally banished her for 5 years (except when he needs to jerk off) and she is referring to her yard as ""our""???? Girl I know damn well he hasn't contributed a dime to that house.
* Miranda getting sucked into a trashy reality show is so on brand, I love it. The guac lady being straight turning out just to be friendly also tracks.
* Carrie to Aidan: ""*Wow, you flew up for 1 night because you felt weird?*"" Me: ""*Least he could do, tbh*""
* Shoe looking up at the bedroom door after Aidan put her out very clearly said, ""EW.""
* Aidan smelling the milk/cream he took out of the fridge before adding it to his coffee brought me instantly back to SATC when he snapped at Carrie for letting the milk go off and I'm mad AF again.
* Seema sweetly dismissing the one dude while she's still sitting next to him at the bar: ""Take care."" 😂
* The Lois Whatshername story took a sudden turn and got me interested when Charlotte had her ""fuck her"" outburst. I love an edgy Charlotte outburst.
* Glad Seema blew Sydney off. I just want her to decide she's fine solo for a while (or indefinitely) and for others to stfu and just let her be that. We need *one* woman on this show who enjoys her own company, and it's obvs not going to be Carrie. We can even just have Seema having flings for a while and not pursuing anything serious.

I drank caffeine on and off for the last 10 years. 1 cup of coffee or latte a day max. I’m experiencing a lot of benefits, like more restful sleep, better focus and concentration while reading, and less potty breaks. Though having some side effects like slower digestion and lower energy which I’m recovering from slowly but surely. But something I’m having alot of trouble with are vivid dreams, intrusive thoughts. For more context, I have had some traumatic events in the past which I took therapy for, as well as some eating disorder related issues. I feel like I’m having a much harder time with flashbacks and body image related issues. Has anybody experienced this? Anyone know what’s happening and when I can expect to get better?

The core of it is simple; I need a computer that is very portable, I have a good(ish) laptop but I need something better for 3d modeling (and some gaming) without forking $2-3k. But I also go out in public to work a lot; coffee shops, libraries, friends houses, parks, etc, and I don't want to be *that guy* who pulls out a full monitor and keyboard and tower and have to set it up every time, it's awkward and clunky and weird.

So then I got to thinking; what if you could have an All-In-One or mini-PC, but then connect a ""fake laptop"" to it (either via Bluetooth or wired idk which would be easier), that's literally just the housing for the peripherals. No internal components in the ""laptop"", it's literally just a case for the monitor and keyboard primarily. Maybe a track pad, maybe a webcam, idk, the important part is that it's ""disconnected"" from the actual computer enough that it'll just look like I have a external hard drive plugged in, or have a weird looking lunchbox

I hope I made the idea clear, lmk if it's not. But is that a thing already? Please say yes and it just has a name I can't think of, because it would be sick if I didn't have to worry about figuring out how to make it myself lol

We hit it off and have been on three dates so far. I have no qualms paying for myself so the first date we went on was a coffee date, and we split the bill. 

The second date was more of a walk through the park where there are stalls that sell coffee and lemonade. He offered to pay for those even after I insisted that I would pay my share. He said it's fine.

On the third date, which was a couple of days ago, he invited me to the movies to cheer me up, after I had fallen severely ill. I was overjoyed to be spending time with him again, but that got shattered when he, in front of the cashier (is that the right word?) said that it's my turn to pay next time. I felt humiliated and belittled, but didn't want to make a scene. 

I haven't said anything to him yet because I'm trying to find the right words to express my disappointment.

So, wise people of reddit, is my date frugal and am I overreacting to the incident?

you didn’t send me a poem.
You showed up.
Late.
Smelling like clove and bad decisions,
your coat unbuttoned
like you’d already decided
how this was going to end.

I didn’t flinch.
I didn’t think.
I left work with the taste of black coffee still on my tongue
and let you press me into the driver’s seat,
the gear shift biting into my thigh,
your fingers sliding past it like they had something to prove.

You said I made you insane.
I said, “Show me.”

You did.

Your mouth was trembling with the weight of everything
you’d said by accident.
You kissed me like you’d been writing that kiss in drafts.
Like punctuation had failed you
and only friction could translate
what you meant when you called me divine.

You moaned into my neck
like confession,
like apology,
like guilt was a language you’d only just become fluent in.
You kept trying to say sorry
and I kept fucking you through it.

At some point I told you to shut up.
Not cruelly.
Just practically.
Your mouth was better elsewhere.

Your hand found the curve of my thigh
like it had trained for this.
I tilted my head back
and thought of nothing.
Which, for me, is a miracle.

You asked if this was okay,
and for once I didn’t overthink the asking.
I just said yes.
I just meant it.

You pressed your forehead to mine
after it was over
and whispered something about energy,
about depth,
about this meaning something.

And I laughed,
softly,
like I was afraid the truth might hear me.

Because it did mean something.
Not forever.
Not fate.
Just clarity.

A body knowing it was wanted.
A soul knowing it wasn’t alone in its madness.
A version of me that didn’t apologize
for needing to be seen
and touched

I've been searching for its successor for a while now, and I've come to terms with the fact that my list of requirements is both long, and annoying. I haven’t found anything that checks all the boxes, but I’m hoping some of you might have suggestions before I start compromising.

So here’s the list *(and yeah, I know it’s a lot—sorry in advance)*:

   **Big Bag**: I’m a fairly large lad (6’4), and most backpacks look tiny on me. Vain, I know, but I'm really looking for a big backpack mostly so it suits me better. I sometimes come close to maxing out the limits of my Kanken, and when it's full it sticks off my back like a little turtle shell, so size is functional too.

 **Laptop Pocket**: I carry my laptop with me constantly, and I'm always pullin' it in and out, so having a secure spot for it has been really nice.

  **Comfortable**: My Kanken’s fine, but not exactly a dream for long walks. I walk 5km to and from work daily, and it gets rough on the shoulders and back.

 **Aesthetic**: I work in academia, and dress quite cliche for that (academic-professional-ish, lots of neutral wool, tweed, etc.) Techwear or outdoorsy styles just look out of place. I don't have a set style in mind, but I'd love something that matches my wardrobe and job and doesn't look like I'm gonna pull a 17"" RGB gaming rig or propane camping stove from it.

**Weather-resistant**: I live in Canada so snow, rain, etc. can happen at a moment's notice and I'd love to not ruin all my student's papers on a coffee run.
 

**Not bank-breaking**: I don't make a whole lotta cash, so I'm trying to keep the budget down. No hard limit, but the more affordable the better.


 **Not American**: Sorry. I know. I'm not trying to ruffle any feathers, I love you folks down there, but as I said; I'm Canadian and--since the constant threats of annexation and looming trade wars--a lot of us are trying to avoid buying American for the time being. A Canadian bag would be great but I'm not against going international either.

The Crimson Orchid Hotel did not advertise.
There was no website. No billboard. No marketing strategy involving social media influencers with suspiciously white teeth; And yet, it was always booked. Not by tourists. Not by families. The kind of guests who found their way to the Crimson Orchid were looking for something more abstract than a good night’s sleep.

Lucas hadn’t known that. Not yet.
He arrived precisely at 9:00 a.m., wearing a navy-blue blazer and the kind of cautious optimism that gets managers killed in horror movies. His resume was spotless. His smile, practiced. He believed in systems, metrics, growth. He had a binder labeled “Revitalization Plan,” and a Bluetooth headset that made him feel competent.

The front doors opened for him. Not with a whoosh—there was no pneumatic assist—but with a slow, groaning creak that felt less like an invitation and more like a sigh. Lucas blinked, adjusted his blazer, and stepped inside.
The lobby was... timeless. And not in a charming antique way. It looked like it had survived multiple redesigns by simply refusing to acknowledge them. The wallpaper shifted when he wasn’t looking directly at it. The chandelier pulsed with a slow heartbeat.

At the front desk, a young woman with tired eyes and a name tag that read ""Mandy"" stared at him like he might be a hallucination.

“Hi!” Lucas said brightly. “Lucas Sterling. New general manager.”

She didn’t move. Her coffee steamed. Her eyes twitched.

“You’re early,” she said.

“I thought it would be good to get a head start,” he offered.

“That’s what the last one said.”

He paused. “And where is the last one?”

Mandy shrugged. “Never clocked out.”

Behind her, the wall groaned.

Lucas didn’t meet Marge until later.
He was still adjusting to the fact that the elevator refused to open for him (it “didn’t like his posture,” according to Mandy), and that the linen closet whispered about birthdays that hadn’t happened yet.

When he finally found the boiler room—guided by a sign that said “STAFF ONLY” and wept slightly at the hinges—he expected a maintenance technician. Maybe an older guy with grease on his jeans and a suspicious allegiance to duct tape.

What he got was Marge.

She was tall, or maybe short. Wide, or maybe narrow. It was difficult to say, because she changed slightly depending on the light. She wore a jumpsuit with too many pockets and a name patch that looked carved into the fabric by something with claws.
She was adjusting a wrench the size of a toddler.

“Hey there,” Lucas said, trying his best “I’m a friendly manager” voice. “You must be Marge.”

She didn’t look at him.

“You joke,” she said.

He blinked. “Excuse me?”

I live out of a suitcase with limited space (chronic over-packer who is about to overpack even more). The downside of entering this world of delicious coffee is now airport and hotel coffee just is not scratching the itch anymore. I’ve settled on trying an aero press setup with an electric kettle and hand grinder. I know nothing about hand grinders besides my research while buying this kit. Is the 1zpresso Q still the best option for a simple travel setup? If I get the aeropress and decide I’m more of a pour over kind of guy, would the 1zpresso Q be good for pour over as well, or should I take a step up to something else to cover my bases? Biggest draw on the Q for me is that it fits in the aero press plunger but if there’s something within the same price range (or slightly over) that is significantly better I would make it work in packing space.

1l4tw4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1l4tw4y/constant_nausea_and_cramping/,Constant nausea and cramping,"Since high school, after eating heavy meals/greasy foods, I would get this horrible upper stomach/abdominal cramping that would only go away if I laid down for a while. This wasn’t an every time thing, but once a month or so. Last year around this time, I went out drinking and had Taco Bell after (bad combo, I know). The next morning I woke up, and the cramping/burning was so bad that I couldn’t stand up. I tried to lay down since I know that’s usually what helps, but this time it was severe. I went to the ER and they gave me this liquid medicine to drink that numbed my esophagus. The pain went away and they sent me home with a medication to reduce the acid levels in my stomach. I was diagnosed with gastritis. I took the medication for a few weeks until it ran out, and I haven’t really had issues since. Last December we ate at a buffet and I did get the stomach cramping and laid down, it went away. Fast forward to last week, I’ve had two days in the same week where I have had bad cramping. At first, I knew it was eating heavier meals more than normal, so I cut out foods that I know were starting to trigger it. I notice though this past month I wake up feeling nauseous and crampy. This morning I had some avocado toast and my morning coffee, now my stomach is burning. I’ve been eating pretty healthy this past week, and I’m wondering what I should from here. I know I need to be more strict with my diet and limit the junk food, but is it normal with gastritis to feel stomach pain just waking up with nausea all of the time, even when cleaning up my diet?

(Tips and tricks that are working for me F: 5’7”: 205~>168 ~5 months,"So You’re Starting Tirzepatide… Now What? I’d love to put this out there because I wish I had it all together like this going in. Yes chat gpt helped me put this all together in a readable format lol. 

When I started Tirzepatide, I didn’t suddenly wake up with discipline, motivation, and flawless health habits. What I did do was start to build better systems one small habit at a time—because for the first time in a long time, my body wasn’t working against me.

This list may feel like a lot. But remember: I didn’t do all of this at once. It evolved over time—and you’ll figure out what works for you, too. Here’s everything I now do alongside Tirz to support fat loss, muscle retention, metabolic healing, and long-term success. I know there are many ways to skin the cat, this is just what works for me so I want to share in case someone can take just one thing from it! 

⸻

💪 1. Protein: Your Foundation

Goal: ~1g of protein per pound of goal weight (I got this from the guys at Mind Pump) → for me- 155g/day (or as close as possible)

I didn’t hit this on Day 1 (or even Day 30 lol, but slowly, I built up to hitting 130–155g daily, which keeps me full, preserves muscle, and supports metabolism.

Tips and tricks I learned over time:
	•	Start every morning with a Fairlife Elite Core Protein Shake (42g, 230 cal)
	•	Add 1 scoop of Paleovalley Bone Broth Protein (flavorless) to my coffee ☕
	•	Lunch is protein-heavy: tuna salad (with avocado, mustard, relish), eggs, chicken, shrimp
	•	On low appetite days: blend a second Fairlife shake with frozen berries and freeze it like ice cream (dessert + protein = win)

⸻

🌿 2. Fiber: The Secret Weapon for Fullness, Digestion, and Hormones

Goal: At least 25g per day 

It supports digestion, prevents constipation (more on that later), and helps your gut and blood sugar stay happy.

What helps me:
	•	Eat ½ to a whole avocado almost every day for lunch 🥑
	•	Add raspberries (6 oz) at night if fiber is low for the day
	•	Sweet potatoes with dinner 2–3 nights/week
	•	Only eat carbs with fiber (fruits, whole grains, root veggies). Skip the empty stuff unless it’s a conscious treat.

⸻

🔥 3. Calories: The Metabolism-Friendly Approach

Goal: ~500-750 deficit- for me 1700/day (but flexible)

Tirzepatide can make it easy to under-eat. I try to intentionally keep my calories in a healthy range.
	•	Minimum: 1500 on low-appetite days (fairlife shakes)
	•	Normal: 1700 (my sweet spot)
	•	Max: Up to 1900 if I’m hungry—without guilt

Don’t starve. That just tanks your metabolism and makes you lose hair and muscle. 

⸻

🚽 4. Constipation: Stay Ahead of It

I learned the hard way (literally 😭), then built a system to stay regular.

What helps:
	•	Prioritize fiber (see above) and some people take fiber supplement (I eat enough tho)
	•	Take Bio-Optimizers Magnesium every night (2 caps)
	•	Use Colace (extra strength) if things start slowing
	•	Add Miralax to my morning coffee protein mix on rough days
	•	Move your body! A simple 1-mile walk is often all it takes

⸻

🏃‍♀️ 5. Movement: No More Punishment Cardio

Old me thought I had to “earn” my food with cardio. New me respects recovery and strength

Goal: ~10,000 steps/day, no intense cardio required

What helped:
	•	Park farther. Walk more often. Shop smaller trips.
	•	Morning walks on my shady dirt road (1.5 miles)
	•	Dance to Get Fit with Rick on YouTube
	•	Post-dinner walks with my family
	•	Light treadmill walks at the gym
	•	Pacing in house while listening to audiobooks = bonus steps

⸻

🏋️‍♀️ 6. Strength Training: Real Lifting, Real Results

You do not need to do crazy circuits or train 6 days a week. In fact, I made better progress doing less. Use a program! 

Current Program: MAPS GLP-1 (from Mind Pump)
Schedule: 3 full-body days/week, 30–45 min each

What helped:
	•	Hired a trainer to teach proper form
	•	Focused on compound lifts (squat, deadlift, bench, overhead press, pull-up w/ assist)
	•	Followed the MAPS structure: progressive overload + deloads
	•	On rest days, walking!

⸻

💧 7. Hydration + Electrolytes: Vital for GLP-1s

Tirzepatide can suppress thirst too—so dehydration sneaks up fast.

Goal: ½ gallon of water per day minimum
What helps me:
	•	Fill a half-gallon jug in the morning
	•	Add Hi-Lyte electrolytes (sugar-free, slightly salty)
	•	Keep the jug with me all day and sip constantly

⸻

💊 8. Supplements: Supporting the Gaps

I’m not trying to fix everything with pills—but the right support helps me stay consistent.

What I take:
	•	Magnesium (Bio-Optimizers): every night
	•	Slow Fe Iron: every 2–3 days in the morning (prevents fatigue)
	•	Purelean Pure Pack: daily vitamin + B complex for ENERGY!
	•	Creatine (Legion): 5g every morning (even if you don’t lift this will help you maintain muscle!💪)

⸻

No I’m not always perfect on all of these but I’m at my happiest and healthiest when I stick to this as close as possible! But giving ourselves grace is important!

💬 Final Thought: Start Where You Are

Don’t try to implement everything at once when you start. It took me months to layer this in. You’ll find what works best for you and I hope there was at least one thing in here for you if you read this all 😅😅

Tirzepatide gives me the quiet I needed to finally build.
But the structure I’m putting in place?
That’s what’s changing everything long-term. Isn’t it great to have hope again?!

I’m someone who finds joy in the little things - a warm cup of coffee on a quiet morning, golden-hour skies that turn the sea into poetry, and the kind of silence you only hear when you’re surrounded by nature. 🌅🌴

I love traveling solo - not for the distance, but for the connection it brings back to myself. Whether I’m biking through sleepy coastal towns, getting lost, or simply people-watching from a local café, I believe there’s something magical about wandering with no agenda.

1l4tuh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1l4tuh8/mentally_ill/,MENTALLY ILL,"

(The quietest wing of the mental hospital. Behind a heavy door, a room exclusive only to selected doctors. Scratch marks on the walls, an old leather sofa and fluorescent lamps flickering in places. Rose firmly grasps her file and clicks the door.)

Rose: (in a low voice)  
“Nathan Whitmore?”

(The door is December. A light smile comes from inside.)

Nathan:  
“If you're knocking, I know you'll come in. Then why are you trying?”

Rose: (steps in, stands cautiously but upright)  
“Because I still believe in the rules.”

Nathan: (he's sitting on the old sofa in the corner of the room, his hands are joined on his knees, his gaze is piercing)  
“Rules… What a sweet word. What about me? Can you define me by your rules too?”

Rose: (looks at the notebook)  
""at the age of 27, an undiagnosed personality disorder. A tendency to consider oneself superior to other people, high intelligence, violation of boundaries…”  
(he raises his head, they meet eye to eye)  
“But also very good manipulation skills.”

Nathan: (smiles)  
“I want to play a game with you, Rose.”

Rose:  
“This is not a game. This is therapy. It's a process with rules.”

Nathan: (he leans forward slowly from where he is sitting)  
“But shall I tell you a secret?”  
(his voice drops)  
“I can only express myself when I'm playing.”

Rose: (slightly startled, but does not show it, sits down in the chair)  
“It surprises me that you are so comfortable.”

Nathan:  
“Because I'm watching you. Since the first day you arrived. You're different from other doctors.”

Rose:  
“Different, what do you mean?”

Nathan:  
“You are not trying to solve me. You're listening to me.”  
(he takes a break Dec.)  
“But be careful. Everyone who listens will eventually either go crazy… or fall in love.”

Rose: (with a slight smile)  
“Was that a threat?”

Nathan:  
“No… it's just statistics.”

(Silence. They both stare at each other. The energy between them Decelerates. Nathan suddenly stands up, but not menacingly, on the contrary, controlled.)

Nathan:  
“Don't ask the questions today. Let me ask.”

Rose: (raises her eyebrows but allows)  
“All right. Ask.”

Nathan: (approaches, but keeps his distance)  
“Who did you see last in your dream?”

Rose:  
“What has this matter to do with you?”

Nathan:  
“Because sometimes… people see in their dreams the desires that they suppress the most.”  
(he continues in a low voice)  
“And I think I was in your dream.”

Rose: (clears her throat, doesn't miss her eyes)  
“You take yourself too seriously.”

Nathan:  
“no. I'm just being very careful.”  
(he examines her gestures with his eyes)  
“And your pupils can't lie to me, Rose.”  
(Rose briefly looks into Nathan's eyes. His heart is beating. Although he tries to control himself, his body language gives him away. Nathan realizes this, does not retreat.)

Nathan:  
“They told you I was a bad person, didn't they?”

Rose:  
“I'm here to see what you are, not what other people say.”

Nathan: (shakes his head slightly, squints his eyes Tuesday)  
“That's why I love you.”

Rose: (sternly)  
“This… that's not the right word, Nathan. This could be a transfer. A patient's temporary feelings for his therapist.”

Nathan: (comes closer, rests on the table)  
“Temporary? Every time I look at you, even the whispers in my mind stop, Rose.”  
(his voice drops)  
“This is not temporary. This is peace.”

Rose: (he turns the pen in his hand, his eyes are caught on her fingers)  
“Even peace of mind can be a threat to someone like you.”

Nathan:  
“What about for you? To be in the same room with me… To come so close to the darkness… Doesn't it bother you at all?”

Rose: (in a whisper, without missing her eyes)  
“I'm here even though he did.”

(The air in the room condenses.Nathan takes another step. The distance Decoupled between them is now a few inches.)

Nathan:  
“I hear your heart beating, Rose.”  
(he pretends to put his hand to his chest, but does not touch it)  
“This is not fear. I don't have the power to scare you… it attracts you more.”

Rose: (her lips tremble but her voice is determined)  
“If you make this mistake, I will have to stop therapy here.”

Nathan: (smiles, if his head is slightly)  
“But you don't want to interrupt. Because when you're talking to me… and you're getting closer to yourself.”  
(tilts his head to the side)  
“How long has it been so… you didn't feel alive, did you?”

Rose: (holds her breath, then retreats, returns to her chair, but her voice is still not shaky)  
“I'm ending this conversation here. That's it for today.”

Nathan: (he leans back slowly, a vague smile on his lips)  
“Of course… doctor, ma'am.”  
(his voice is sarcastic but compassionate)  
“But this is only the beginning.”

Rose:  
“I'm here to save you, Nathan.”

Nathan:  
“No, Rose. You came here to save yourself… but you don't realize it.”

(Looking at Nathan for the last time, Rose leaves the room. As he walks down the corridor, his breathing becomes irregular. Anyone looking from the outside would think you were just tired. But inside… Nathan's voice still resonates.)

(Corridor. The sounds of Rose's heels walking in silence echo on the wall. His hands are not in his pockets, he does not have a notebook. It's as if he left not the room, but Nathan's mind… He stands on a bench and takes a deep breath.)

Rose (inner voice):  
“This is not professionalism. This is an uncontrolled thing. It's like burning with a dark person when he draws you in…”

(He puts his thumb to his lips involuntarily. It's an act he's been doing unwittingly throughout therapy. He's coming to his senses at that moment. He's looking around. The corridor is empty. Squeezing his file, he starts walking towards his room.)

In the meantime… THE THERAPY ROOM.

(Nathan is still in the same place. He looks at the chair where Rose is sitting. His eyes are empty, but in one way… in life.)

Nathan (in a whisper):  
“Rose.”

(He stands up slowly. He runs his fingers through his hair, as if he wants not to express his tension Decently. Then he slowly starts talking to himself, whether it's a dream or not, it's not clear.)

Nathan:  
“You have not looked at me with mercy. Compassion is a condescending thing. You understood me.”

(He leans his head back, his eyes are closed. It was as if there was still that warmth in the room with his presence.)

Nathan:  
“They say you want to save yourself. But it's you who really wants to be saved, Rose. No matter how much you try to protect your borders… the voices inside you don't stop either, do they?”

(He suddenly opens his eyes. His eyes are not red, but there is something flashing in them. Desire? Or the danger?)

Nathan:  
“I will tear you to pieces.”  
(smiles)  
“But gently.”

ROSE'S ROOM

(Rose is looking at herself in the mirror. He pauses as he takes off the jacket. He notices the pulse on her neck, her hands are shaking. He opens the water bottle, but he can't drink. His eyes slide to the glass. He sees eye to eye with his own reflection in the glass.)

Rose (inner voice):  
“What are you doing? You entered that room to solve it. But his eyes, it was like he could read your subconscious.”

(He reaches for his phone. In the search history ‘Consultant Psychiatrist - Dr. Dec. Zack's name still stands. His finger tremblingly hovers over it, but he does not call. He breathes, deeply and painfully.)

Rose:  
“I'm his therapist.”  
(pauses, in a whisper)  
“I can't fall in love with him.”

At that time… WHEN NATHAN WAS ALONE IN THE ROOM

(Darkness has begun to fall. He walks towards the looking glass. He locks his eyes to the glass. He is so quiet that he cannot even hear his own breathing.)

Nathan:  
“They are watching me. But you… you look at it differently.”

(He puts his fingers on the glass, almost like touching her face.)

Nathan:  
“I don't know what to do with you, Rose. The line between Deconstructing you and loving you… it's very thing.”

(Rose's room. Night. It's dark, it's raining outside. The drops flowing through the glass create flickering shadows on the wall by the light of the dim lamp. Rose is tired. He's lying on his bed. His eyes are closing.)

THE DREAM BEGINS.

(The therapy room… but it's different. The walls are darker, there are no tables. Just two chairs. And Rose is not alone.)

(Nathan is sitting right across from her. This time his hands are not tied. His clothes are casual but stylish; black shirt, messy hair. His gaze is sharp, but… on the one hand, it's suffocatingly soft.)

Nathan:  
“There are no limits this time. And there are no questions.”

Rose (confused):  
“This is the place… it's not a therapy room.”

Nathan:  
“But you imagined me here again. Don't lie to yourself, Rose.”

Rose:  
“It's a dream.”

Nathan:  
“yes. And this is the most honest version of you that your mind has given me.”

(Nathan stands up, his steps slow but steady. Rose wants to step back, but her chair restrains her. Nathan kneels down and comes to eye level.)

Nathan:  
“Your pupils are growing. The sound of your heart is ringing in my ears. You think you're scared, but”""

(He holds out his hand. He touches Rose's cheek. The moment his fingers touch her skin, Rose holds her breath.)

Rose (in a whisper):  
“Don't.”

Nathan:  
“No one stops in a dream, Laura. Everything you suppress is revealed here.”

(He puts his head closer to her neck. His breath is hot and dangerous.)

Nathan:  
“You don't want me. You want to escape from yourself.”

Rose (eyes closed, out of breath):  
“You are a patient.”

Nathan:  
“And you are a woman who cannot stop understanding me.”

The distance between them is Decoupled. Her lips come closer together, but just before kissing… a scream breaks out Dec. Rose's scream.)

Rose suddenly wakes up.

(He is sitting up in bed, his forehead is covered in sweat. Breathlessly. He puts his hands to his head. It's still raining on the window, but it's much quieter outside.)

Rose (in a whisper, to herself):  
“No… no, it's just a dream.”

(But something is still squeezing in his chest. It's like a knot where desire and guilt are tangled together. His eyes involuntarily shift to the window… and for a moment, he feels as if someone is looking at him through the window of the hospital building.)

Rose (to herself):  
“This… will not end.”

the day after

(Hospital, morning. Rose is holding her coffee in her hand, but she's not drinking. Purple under the eyes. His fingers are trembling in the cup. He's walking slowly down the hall to Nathan's room. When he gets his fingers on the doorknob, he gets out of breath.)

Rose(inner voice):  
“Calm down. Yesterday was just a dream. It's just a dream. Psychological reflection. You can't let it affect you.”

(He opens the door. Nathan's sitting there in the chair. His arms are on the table. He has his head slightly tilted to the side, watching her coming. He's smiling - too calm, too… familiar.)

Nathan:  
“You're too late today. Or… did you have a hard time waking up?”

Rose (dully):  
“…Sir?”

Nathan (without blinking an eye):  
""Sometimes dreams make a person dizzy in the morning. Especially if the person… met his desires in that dream.”

(Rose's face tightens. His heart speeds up. He sits down, but does not take the pen in his hand, does not open the notebook.)

Rose:  
“This is a therapy session. It's not a game. Please let's not personalize it.”

Nathan (if his head, his smile becomes sneaky):  
“It is not I who am making it personal, Rose. Thinking about me all night long… it was you.”

Rose:  
“This… this is completely unreasonable.”

Nathan:  
“You approached me in a dream. You wanted to stop me. But you couldn't even stop yourself.”  
(he stares into her eyes)  
“The pulse in your neck is still there, Rose. In the same place, at the same speed.”

(Rose gets up, staggering.)

Rose:  
“That's nonsense. How do you know all this?”

Nathan (leans forward slightly, his voice low but devastating):  
“I am in you.”

(Silence. The room seems to suffocate for a moment. Rose's pen falls out of her hand, she looks out of the window, but her eyes seem to be stuck in the room. Nathan is leaning back in his chair, comfortably.)

Nathan:  
“When you were trying to solve me… you opened yourself. There's a room in your mind reserved for me now. And I have no intention of getting out of there.”

Rose (in a whisper):  
“you… you're a patient.”

Nathan (without squinting):  
“You too… you're not that healthy anymore.”  
(Rose quickly leaves the room. He breathes deeply with his back against the wall, covering his face with his hands. It's almost like tears will be shed. But she won't cry. Because he doesn't cry… he fears even worse: that Nathan is right.)

evening

(Night. The hospital archive room. Rose waited for the other therapists to come out. He has a flashlight and a staff card in his hand. His heart doesn't fit in his chest.)

Rose (inner voice):  
“I was supposed to keep my distance from you, but dreams… it goes deeper than the truth. I have to understand you, Nathan. Where did you come from? What did you do?”

(He opens the locks of the glazed cabinets, finds the thick file with a red label that says 'Nathan Whitmore'. He opens it with trembling hands. The pages are yellowed, some are missing, some are scrawled in black ink.)

What is written in the file (with the inner voice of Rose Dec between documents):

>Patient name: Nathan Whitmore  
Date of birth: September 1, 1997  
Diagnosis: Antisocial personality disorder, post-traumatic psychosis  
Note: The patient witnessed the death of his entire family at the age of 17. It was noted that he showed no reaction at the scene.  
Rose (in a whisper):  
“His parents… are they dead?”  
Event Summary:  
A house fire. He was detained on suspicion of murder but was released due to lack of evidence. He said only one sentence: “I just made them quiet down.”  
Rose (in surprise):  
“Have I quieted it? What does this mean?”  
Monitoring Note - 2021:  
The patient shows manipulative behavior towards other patients. He shows impressive, seductive attitudes, especially towards female therapists. It was not clear whether he was conscious or unconscious.  
Private note (confidential):  
His previous therapist, Dr . Shaw was dismissed from his post after inappropriate intimacy with the patient. The therapist suffered a serious psychotic breakdown after her sessions with Nathan. He's been admitted to the hospital right now.

(Rose's hands are shaking. Her pupils are enlarged, her lip is dry. It's like he's afraid to go to the next page. But it goes on.)

>Drawing Octets:  
The pictures Nathan made: burnt hands, women's faces, broken mirrors… and in one of them a silhouette that looks exactly like Rose.

Rose (putting her hand over her mouth):  
“Is that… is that me?”

(At that moment, a voice comes from behind. The room is dim, but that voice is familiar. We're very familiar.)

Nathan (from the door, in a soft but icy tone):  
“I knew you liked to be alone at night. But I didn't know you preferred the archive room, Rose.”

(Rose can't turn around. The file in his hand falls to the ground. Nathan doesn't come out of the shadows, we just hear his voice.)

Nathan:  
“Tell me now… even after what you have seen… will you still try to understand me? Otherwise, no more… did you realize that you can't escape me even in your dreams?”

(In the archive room, Rose is still unable to look in the direction from which Nathan's voice came. The file fell to the ground. His fingers hold the pages, but his eyes are in Nathan's shadow.)

Nathan (footsteps are heard):  
“I know you're scared, Rose. But there is something else underneath that fear. Curiosity. Desire. Loyalty. Don't deny him.”

Rose (breathing fast):  
“You… are a sick person. These feelings are not real. You are a manipulation. You always do that!”

Nathan (comes closer, his voice is very close to his ear):  
“Then why can't you shut up your heart?”

(Rose turns suddenly, her chest close enough to Nathan's to touch. They see eye to eye. There's something in Nathan's eyes — something burning. It's like madness and passion are intertwined. Rose wants to take a step back, but her feet won't budge.)

Rose:  
“I had to… treat you.”

Nathan:  
“But you have been ill yourself.”  
(he stares into her eyes)  
""You touched me, Rose. Even in the first session. With your eyes, with your voice, with your mind. Now you want to have me. You're saying let's break all the rules.”

(Rose's eyes fill up, but she doesn't cry. He puts his hand on Nathan's chest, tries to push. But his hand remains powerless. Nathan holds her hand, gently stroking her fingers.)

Rose (in a whisper):  
“This… wrong.”

Nathan:  
“But your body says ‘yes’. How did you feel when you saw me in your dream? When you touched my neck? When you mix your breath with mine?”

(Rose closes her eyes. Not tears, but fire pours out of it. Nathan, he touches your face. He strokes her cheek with his thumb.)

To be continued

1. Do you think, Rose, Nathan is really in love, or is he just drawn to his dark side?
2. Can love heal the darkness inside Nathan?
3. Do you think the relationship between the two is based more on passion, or is there a real connection between them? Deca Deca deca deca deca deca deca deca deca?
4. Can a therapist fall in love with his patient? Do you think Rose has overstepped her professional boundaries?
5. Does Nathan's history of mental illness make this relationship dangerous?
6. Is Rose losing her identity by getting closer to Nathan, or is she becoming herself for the first time?,   [7.Do](http://7.Do) you think this relationship can turn into a healthy love, or does it lead to destruction? 8.Does Nathan really love Rose, or is he controlling her?
7. Is this relationship a “story of salvation” or a “beautiful disaster”?

I currently have a Bunn 10 cup maker and it was great at first, but now the coffee just tastes flavorless? It always looks watered down too no matter what I do. Plus it’s not working very well anymore. I have a Nespresso machine but with how expensive the pods are, that’s more of a once in a while cup of coffee. Also have a French press but it’s not really practical for multiple cup, every day use imo. Between my husband and I we drink a while pot every day. Our main desire is to have a strong, really good tasting cup of coffee. It’s all about the flavor for us, while having a whole pot amount.

1l4trg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1l4trg7/are_developers_lying_when_they_say/,Are developers lying when they say 'Mobile-Optimized' or do they just not own phones?,"Okay, hear me out. I think there's a massive conspiracy happening in the SaaS world and nobody's talking about it.

**The conspiracy:** Developers are either straight-up lying about ""mobile optimization"" or they've never actually used a phone in their lives.

I went down a rabbit hole this week (couldn't sleep, thanks anxiety) and decided to test this theory. Grabbed 47 random SaaS websites that all proudly claim to be ""mobile-optimized.""

**Plot twist:** They're full of shit.

**Here's the smoking gun evidence:**

**34 sites took 8+ seconds to load**

* Bro, I can order a pizza faster than your homepage loads

**19 sites had buttons smaller than a Tic Tac**

* Are we optimizing for ants? What is this, a signup button for ANTS?

**27 sites had forms that literally disappeared off-screen**

* ""Please enter your email in this invisible field floating in the void""

1**8 sites required a magnifying glass to read the pricing**

* Squinting is not a feature, Kevin

**But here's where it gets weird...**

I started digging into who built these sites. Guess what? **Almost every single agency/dev** listed ""mobile-first development"" as their specialty!

Either we have the most incompetent mobile developers in history, or something else is going on.

**My theory:**

Most developers test their ""mobile-optimized"" sites on:

* Giant desktop monitors using browser dev tools
* The latest iPhone Pro Max with perfect WiFi
* Maybe an iPad if they're feeling fancy

But real users are on:

* 3-year-old Android phones with cracked screens
* Spotty 4G while riding the bus
* Trying to signup during their 2-minute coffee break

**The conspiracy deepens:**

I talked to 12 different agencies last month. Want to know their mobile testing process?

* ""We use Chrome dev tools"" (not a real phone)
* ""We test on iPhone 14"" (3% of actual users)
* ""It's responsive, so it works"" (narrator: it didn't work)

**ONE agency** actually pulled out a real Android phone during our call. Guess which one got my business?

**The most damning evidence:**

I called out one agency on LinkedIn. Their response? ""Mobile optimization is subjective.""

SUBJECTIVE?!

Your signup button being invisible isn't subjective, Brad. It's just broken.

**Here's my challenge to every SaaS founder reading this:**

Right now. Put down your laptop. Grab your phone (preferably an older one). Try to:

* Sign up for your own trial (could be better if you clear cookies & cache first, you can even clear for your saas only in site settings)
* Navigate your pricing page
* Actually complete onboarding

If you rage-quit your own product, imagine what your users are doing.

**The real conspiracy:**

We're all so focused on desktop metrics that we're ignoring the fact that 62% of B2B buyers start their research on mobile. We're literally paying Facebook and Google to send traffic to broken experiences.

Your CAC isn't high because of competition. It's high because your mobile site converts like a broken vending machine.

**Am I going crazy here?**

Has anyone else noticed this pattern? Or did I just randomly pick the 47 worst websites on the internet?

Because if ""mobile-optimized"" means ""technically displays pixels on a phone screen,"" then sure, these sites are optimized. But if it means ""actually works for humans,"" then we have a problem.",3,1749219961.0,SaaS,5,0.8,False

My girlfriend and I just moved in together, and I had the brilliant idea to wake up early last weekend and make her breakfast in bed. Real wholesome shit. I made pancakes, scrambled eggs, coffee. Even warmed the plates like I saw in some Gordon Ramsay video. I was proud.

I get everything onto a tray and start walking up the stairs. What I didn’t realize is that our cat had left one of her little rubber mouse toys right on the third step. One of those tiny bastard ones that looks like lint until it's under your foot.

I step on it. Instantly lose my footing. Tray launches. Food is airborne. I go down like a sack of wet laundry. Pancakes fly. Coffee explodes on the wall. I hit the bottom of the stairs in a twisted pile of regret and syrup.

My girlfriend runs out of the bedroom like she just heard a home invasion. She finds me groaning on the floor, holding my wrist, with a pancake stuck to my back like some kind of domestic shuriken. I tell her I think I broke something.

We go to the ER. X-rays confirm: fractured wrist. The nurse doesn’t even react when I explain what happened. Just writes it down and moves on like she’s heard this exact story before, which honestly makes it worse.

Now my wrist is in a brace, my girlfriend has banned “surprises of any kind,” and the cat is still loose, presumably planning her next attack.

10/10 would not recommend.

TL;DR: Tried to be sweet, stepped on a cat toy, flew down the stairs, broke my wrist, and now I’m banned from being thoughtful.

Nero relished in her pain as if it were a fine foreign delicacy prepared by Eliza. As if the young lady had nothing better to do in her spare time other than cook for some greedy bum. Hah! Yeah right. And poor Lenda, she just knew that you were going to vote her as your favorite, um, antiheroine? Antagonist? Well, she was good at antagonizing for sure, but that’s not the point! Whatever she was and whatever they were, she for sure thought it was a foregone conclusion. I mean, come on, her teammates had the combined personality of a baked potato. And not the loaded kind they sold at Wendy’s. Not even close. I’m talking plain old, “how long has this thing been sitting in the refrigerator, collecting bacteria” type of half-baked potato that leaves a bad taste in your mouth from the first bite all the way up until the end when your stomach starts to bubble.    

A light bulb went off in her head! Ahah! Maybe if she charmed her way into your heart with a funny line or two, you’d feel bad enough to vote for her the next time she organized a popularity poll. Was her idea pathetic? Yeah, pretty much. What about silly? Yup, that too, but so what! She was a very, um, *humble* vampire? It wasn’t her fault that she had bad luck, and bad timing when you think about it. Since these misfortunes had been thrust upon her shoulders by such a cruel universe, she was not above receiving things she didn’t deserve out of sympathy or outright thievery. That’s why when she looked over at you with a suspicious smile, you already knew what was up.

“That’s alright. I know why you didn’t vote for me. It’s okay, I’m not angry or anything. Trust me, I get it. We’ll keep the reason why between us. Wouldn’t want to hurt their feelings now would we?” she suggested all sneakily like a ninja. “Look here. I’ll make it easy for you. I’m the only one on this team that doesn’t suck. I mean, well, technically I do since I’m the only vampire on this team, but you get what I mean, or at least I really hope you do, do you?” she asked while giggling at like the worse time imaginable. “Yeah Nero might be strong, and Nano might be intimidating, but don’t let that stop you, okay? A vote for me is a vote for freedom and democracy!”  

“You’re doing that thing again where you run your mouth in circles. Oh, and you’re also doing that thing again where you make yourself look stupid,” Nero told her in a very matter-of-fact tone.

*“Nobody cares what you think, demon-boy!”* she said rather venomously while brandishing a kunai at him. As if on cue, she very calmly returned to her charm campaign, by telling you, “I’m sorry you had to see that. But again... That’s why you should have voted for me in the first place. Anyway. What was I saying? Oh yeah, that’s right, *Mmhmm...* so, yeah, I know it’s kind of embarrassing that you didn’t, but again, no worries. I’m sure I’ll gain your *vote of confidence* the next time we try this!” she said before covering her mouth and laughing at her own, um, drollery. “Get it? ‘Vote of Confidence!’ Hah-ha! Tell me I didn’t *land* that joke-plane!”

“More like vote of no confidence with a ‘joke-plane’ that terrible,” Nero told her before staring at you and shaking his head while sneering, “I’m glad you didn’t vote for her. The last thing I needed was to have her throw something like that in my face all day today.”

“Hey! W-what do you mean by that? It wasn’t funny?” she asked Nero before dismissing him and asking you. “You thought my joke-plane was funny, right?”

Realizing her mistake, she threw up her hands and quickly blurted, “No! Don’t answer that! Whatever you do—do not answer that—well obviously you *can’t* answer that—I know that—you know what I mean, ugh! Crap. Do you know what I mean? Do I even know what I mean at this point? Ugh?! This is impossible! Why am I still even talking and proving Nero’s point that I’m a mouth circle?! Look... Let’s just try again after we, um, I don’t know. After we take down a good guy or something,” she huffed after putting way too much dressing on her word salad.

“You mean like an angel?” Nero asked.

“Yeah, but not just any angel—a boss.”

“Who fits the criteria?” he asked her.

“I don’t know. Gabriel, maybe?”

“Gabriel, huh? I forgot about him,” Nero said as he thought about it. There was a fire in his eyes as he played out the battle in his head. “Yeah... that might be a tough one. I wonder if he’d use that giant crystal sword of his, he got from the Atlanteans, or would he fight hand-to-hand.”

Sensei had been standing there this whole time, in front of the class, sipping coffee from his “thrashy” NWO mug. Just listening to his students converse while doing that thing where he darkened the atmosphere with his presence. Nero’s remark was enough to make him finally chime in on the conversation. “Interesting but highly unlikely given his nature.”

“Why do you think they didn’t vote for me?” Lenda asked desperately.

He shrugged nonchalantly and said, “That’s between you and them.”

Lenda frowned while muttering, “Gah. Why do you always do that?”

Sensei ignored her self-loathing inquiry. It did make him smirk a bit as he said, “Now. Before I tell you about your next mission.” He turned Lenda’s way and told her, specifically, “I know you think I’m the worse at answering questions, but I’d like to open the floor to you and your squad just in case any of you might have one. And no. You cannot ask me anything. I am not an open book...”

“That wasn’t very friendly,” Lenda complained.

“I wasn’t trying to be friendly,” he told her.

“I have a question for you,” Wicked Stepmother said to Nano right after putting the finishing touches on the blueprints to this awesome new doomsday device the Department of Paranormal Investigation R&D department had asked her to review.

“Yes, mother?” Nano asked.

“How’s your personality update?”

“It is acceptable.”

She put on her reading glasses and scrolled down on her tablet to a set of questions she had already prepared. Not even bothering with formalities or niceties, she hopped right into it without much explanation other than: *“I have a few questions for you...* Hmm, let me see. Okay. The first one is: if you had a pet goldfish and it died how would you feel?”

“I would feel nothing.”

“What if you were human?”

“I would feel sad.”

“Correct. Question number two: if you saw a cat stuck in a tree what would you do? Would you help the cat out of the tree or not?” she asked him.

“I would not unless prompted.”

“What if you were human.”

“I would engage in a rescue operation unprompted.”

“Okay... and how would you engage in this rescue mission of yours? How would you remove the cat from the tree without harming it?” she asked.

“I would obliterate the tree with a level one particle beam.”

“Incorrect! Humans do not have particle beams!” she shouted angrily before hammering her fist down on the table and telling him, “Last question! And you better get it right: when a human baby cries, is it because they’re sad or happy?”

“It is because they are sad.”

“What would you do to make it stop?” she asked with prowling eyes.

“I would... use nanites to rearrange it’s molecular—”

*“Try again!”* she shouted before he could even finish.

“I would... exterminate the baby.”

*“Are you crazy?!”*

“\[Processing...\]”

“Err! No processing! This question is the easiest question in the world! Use some common sense! It’s a baby! It’s crying—what do you do to make it stop?!” She asked with a super angry expression, like she was about to leap over the counter and assault him.

“I would... subdue the baby like a human mother.”

“Correct! Wow! Was that so hard? Oh and by the way, the baby might be crying because it’s hungry, tired, wet, cold, hot, there’re a million reasons, but yes—you’d start by ‘subduing’ and then move on to other things if doing that, whatever that is, doesn’t work,” she said before furiously typing his responses into her laptop so that her superiors could laugh at him and then her by proxy. 

“I have a question,” Nano said.

“What’s bugging your AI?” she asked.

“My question pertains to consciousness and identity. SAI have two unique personas that act in tandem with one another to form one singular personality.  The collective \[core\] consciousness and our unique but minor \[unity\] persona. My question is: are people different or do people process information differently?”

Wicked Stepmother put her fist under her chin as she thought about his question. “Hmm. Can you elaborate a little more?”

“Are people not so different from SAI? Their brains all share the same basic anatomical structure in a way that is comparable to our \[Penelope\] processors. They all process consciousness differently and have unique storage data. Meaning... they are allowed to quantify thought how they see fit, which is comparable to our ability to alter the code of our \[unity\] persona.”

Wicked Stepmother shrugged. “I don’t know. I have a masters in AI, not neurology or neuroscience. Hmm... your question is a good one. Huh... if I had to guess, I’d say that consciousness determines a person’s ‘persona.’ So, in a way, we are very similar to SAI, but from what I know about the human brain, yes, we all share basic anatomical similarities, like you mentioned, but everything else is unique to the person: size, shape, cortical folds, synaptic and neuronal connections—all of that stuff is different even in identical twins. That is why I am different from my mother and why I call her ‘mother’ and not ‘my adult self from the future.” And even though I imagine this would be the case for SAI, the variances would be harder to detect since you all have identical Penelope processors—which is what I’m sure everyone would consider the ‘brain’ of any computer, right? Anyway, if you cloned or copied or whatevered yourself, your duplicate would still have different experiences from you and its own individual uniqueness, but again, I don’t think the differences would be as drastic as they would be in humans. This one subtle distinction, in what I guess you could call ‘the conscious experience,’ is the one issue that separates sentient machines from human beings. So, to answer your original question: I would have to say that SAI are different but process information the same. And as far as humans go, I think we are all the same but process information differently, which is kind of what you said. Does that answer your question?”

“Yes. Thank you mother.”

“You know I’m not really your mother?”

“Should I call you Research Specimen: L07-05-09017?”

“No! What’s wrong with you!” she yelled while grabbing the nearest thing, which was a saltshaker, and tossing it at him. It hit him square in the face, making a soft thudding noise.

He didn’t even blink, neither did he seem to care about Lenda and Nero’s laughter. An odd thing occurred... The still spinning shaker and the pile of salt on the ground vanished. It appeared a split second later back on her desk, right where it was before she had chucked it at him. When Lenda saw this, she stopped laughing and asked how in the world did he do that?

“Instant de-molecularization. I can overwhelm the structural integrity of small objects in post physical time and reformat the matter with the use of nanites,” he explained.

“He can do what?” Nero asked Lenda.

“Basically. He can alter stuff superfast.”

“Yeah...” Nero nodded as if he understood.

“You don’t get it do you?” she asked him.

“Nope.”

“It’s cool. Hm—I’ll show you,” she said before grabbing the pen off her desk and handing it to her clueless squad mate. “Go on. Snap it.”

“You sure? I mean It’s a nice pen,” he said.

“Just do it,” she smiled, “Jeez. You’re so holy.”

“Shut up,” he said before snapping the thing in half as easy as a child breaking a tasty Jolly Rancher candy cane in half to share with his friend. “Now what?” he asked while watching ink pen fluid stain his fingers and pool on the desk.

Lenda looked over at Nano and asked, “Can you fix it?”

“Yes.”

“But in real time so he can see.”

“Affirmative.”

Nero watched in amazement as a mini electromagnetic vortex appeared right above his head. Trillions of microscopic, metallic-like insect-looking nanites poured from the portal. They swarmed around the pen and his stained hands like a violent storm. The pen dematerialized right before his eyes, millimeter by millimeter, until it had disappeared completely. Within the storm cloud, he could see lightning flashes and plasma waves from a million micro collisions as the subatomic particles smashed together and fused the pen back into its original form.

Nero stared at the pen, at his fingers, and at the desk to see if the pool of ink was still there. Amazingly, it had all been restored as if he had never snapped the thing in half to begin with. He looked up and watched as the small particle vortex faded out of existence. Then his eyes shot over to Nano and he asked, “Can you do that to larger objects like this desk or a person?”

“Large objects require a significant amount of energy that increases in equal proportion to the size and scale of the object, and I have not been authorized to demolecule organic beings. To alter humans would require an override from Mother.”

“You mean my mother?” Wicked asked.

“Yes. From the original Susan Jane.”

Sensei looked over at you and shook his head for whatever reason. Then he placed his mug on the counter and brought his hands together. “I hate to break up the science experiment, but the mission. I’d like to begin before it gets late.”

*“Yes!”* Nero exclaimed all happily, “I can’t wait to hear what it is—I-I bet it’ll be crazy and dangerous just the way I like. I can’t wait to sharpen my skills.”

“Are you finished?” Sensei asked.

“Yeah! Let’s do this!” he exclaimed.

“You’re standing on your desk...” Lenda whispered.

“Oh,” he said before looking down, “Sorry. I guess the excitement went to my head.”

Sensei was impressed by his speed and balance, but he would never tell him that. That would only feed his ego and turn it into an Eggo. Heh. He smirked at his own wordplay. Perhaps their silliness was starting to rub off on him. He thought about this while watching in further amazement as Nero dashed into his seat faster than the wink of an eye. After that, he picked up his mug and finished his coffee before saying, “Your mission for today is simple. Assist the unholy priest and his parishioners as they put the finishing touches on our newly rebuilt anti-church.”

I’ve been feeling pretty lost lately behind in life, behind in academics, and ahead only in self-doubt. I keep thinking I should have it all figured out by now… but I don’t. And maybe you don’t either. Maybe that’s okay.

I’m not here for fleeting chats or curated selfies. I’m hoping to find someone who wants to build something a little more real. Something slow, imperfect, and honest.

About me:

25M, heart pure a child yet mind bruised like intellectuals 

Overthinker, coffee addict, occasionally funny when sleep-deprived

Lover of deep conversations, cozy silences, and finding beauty in mundane things

Currently battling my own mind, deadlines, and existential dread but still hopeful, still curious about people


About you?

You don’t need to have it all figured out (actually, it’s better if you don’t)

You miss late-night talks that feel like therapy

You believe in sincerity over aesthetics

You’d rather swap weird confessions, music, book ideas, or even favorite comfort foods than “wyd” texts


Maybe we’ll bond over burnt cookies, unfinished books, or the absurdity of adulthood. Maybe we’ll create our own space to talk about everything and nothing. Maybe we’ll send each other songs that feel like home.

If you’re also tired of pretending and just want to connect as two humans trying to navigate this mess called life, drop me a message.

1l4tm06,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1l4tm06/the_crimson_orchid/,The Crimson Orchid,"The Crimson Orchid Hotel did not advertise.
There was no website. No billboard. No marketing strategy involving social media influencers with suspiciously white teeth; And yet, it was always booked. Not by tourists. Not by families. The kind of guests who found their way to the Crimson Orchid were looking for something more abstract than a good night’s sleep.

Lucas hadn’t known that. Not yet.
He arrived precisely at 9:00 a.m., wearing a navy-blue blazer and the kind of cautious optimism that gets managers killed in horror movies. His resume was spotless. His smile, practiced. He believed in systems, metrics, growth. He had a binder labeled “Revitalization Plan,” and a Bluetooth headset that made him feel competent.

The front doors opened for him. Not with a whoosh—there was no pneumatic assist—but with a slow, groaning creak that felt less like an invitation and more like a sigh. Lucas blinked, adjusted his blazer, and stepped inside.
The lobby was... timeless. And not in a charming antique way. It looked like it had survived multiple redesigns by simply refusing to acknowledge them. The wallpaper shifted when he wasn’t looking directly at it. The chandelier pulsed with a slow heartbeat.

At the front desk, a young woman with tired eyes and a name tag that read ""Mandy"" stared at him like he might be a hallucination.

“Hi!” Lucas said brightly. “Lucas Sterling. New general manager.”

She didn’t move. Her coffee steamed. Her eyes twitched.

“You’re early,” she said.

“I thought it would be good to get a head start,” he offered.

“That’s what the last one said.”

He paused. “And where is the last one?”

Mandy shrugged. “Never clocked out.”

Behind her, the wall groaned.

Lucas didn’t meet Marge until later.
He was still adjusting to the fact that the elevator refused to open for him (it “didn’t like his posture,” according to Mandy), and that the linen closet whispered about birthdays that hadn’t happened yet.

When he finally found the boiler room—guided by a sign that said “STAFF ONLY” and wept slightly at the hinges—he expected a maintenance technician. Maybe an older guy with grease on his jeans and a suspicious allegiance to duct tape.

What he got was Marge.

She was tall, or maybe short. Wide, or maybe narrow. It was difficult to say, because she changed slightly depending on the light. She wore a jumpsuit with too many pockets and a name patch that looked carved into the fabric by something with claws.
She was adjusting a wrench the size of a toddler.

“Hey there,” Lucas said, trying his best “I’m a friendly manager” voice. “You must be Marge.”

She didn’t look at him.

“You joke,” she said.

He blinked. “Excuse me?”

“You joke. And the Hotel laughs.”

Lucas smiled tightly. “Right. Of course. That’s... comforting.”

From a pipe above him, a single droplet of water fell directly onto his shoulder. It hissed.

Marge finally looked up.

“This place remembers everything,” she said. “Even managers.”

Then she returned to her work, as if he weren’t there.

Lucas adjusted his blazer. ""Cool cool cool."" He muttered to himself. 
He was definitely going to need a new binder.",1,1749219582.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

I'd recommend renting a scooter for that drive cause the views are not just scenic, but they're also panoramic. Me & a couple of fellow travellers stopped at the Canada Bakery, where the only thing sweeter than the views is their pastries & pies. The cafe is on the first floor of a tiny house by the side of a picturesque road, overlooking the valley in front.

I was really looking forward in meeting you in person because you are good looking as well. That’s why when I saw you. Wow. Those broad shoulders? But i just played it cool because I know you have a girlfriend and in a complicated situation. We had a great time what I appreciated so much was how you put your hands around my waist or shoulders and as if you were protecting me from the foot traffic but again i just played it cool. What made me happy that time was that we attended the same school! Anyway I hope okay pa kayo ng gf mo but if not then maybe? Hahahaha
