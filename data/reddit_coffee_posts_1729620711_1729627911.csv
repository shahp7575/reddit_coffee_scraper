1g9rq2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g9rq2o/21m_asked_a_girl_out_for_a_coffee/,[21M] asked a girl out for a coffee,"Dear Reddit Community,

Hello, I am a 21 year-old male who has never had prior dating experience. Yesterday, there was one girl who tried to initiate a conversation with me while at bus station. This girl is also known to me as my classmate. But at the time, I think I did not attempt much to pursue the conversation. I naturally felt bad if I seemed cold/disinterested. However, to be honest, it could be great if it were a reason to be friends and maybe date later.

Probably foolishly, I came up with the idea of asking her out one-to-one for a coffee and made sure that it wasn’t in a flirty way. She said that she has a boyfriend currently, so I felt embarrassed and had no idea how to react next. I was so embarrassed that I lied “Of course, why else would I invite you?”. Now, I am planning not to go to school tomorrow.

1g9rmur,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_khoobah/comments/1g9rmur/typying_questionaire_a_long_one/,Typying questionaire (a long one),"Okay so I firstly wanna apologize, this is going to be a long one on the account of my inability to condense information, I just keep expanding more and more but I did try.

Now I firstly wanna say, yes I took the test because I've seen someone ask that under typing posts, but it wasn't very frutiful, I've gotten anything from inconsistent, if believeable results to stuff like 1V which I feel is extremely unlikely at the very least (I'd say impossible for me but I'm here to learn so I can't make statements).

Now I did familiarize myself with the system a bit but I do have trouble sorting information I learn but if I had to say I'd imagine it like this:

  
Feel free to discrad this part naturally because I'm not well enough informed so these are just my guesses.

E - I'd say either 1 or 2 because I'm fairly confident in my emotions 

L - I could see being 3 or 4, I am very skeptical so I was leaning towards 3 but I'm not totally unreceptive towards outside information, also I do care a lot about being right and about truth somewhat so idk

V - I'd say 3 could be possible because I'm pretty non-conformist and certainly not a planner but at the same time I do feel like my volition fluctuates a bit.

F - 3 was my first guess here because I'm insecure about finances and go between ignoring my health and hypochodria and also don't very much like advice on health but at the same time though bit insecure about my looks I don't focus on them let alone overcomepsate for them. I also don't feel like 4F because I do value material possesions.

  
Again sorry for this being long and thanks if you took the time, I appreciate it.

  
**L (logic)**

* **How much time and energy do you spend researching or studying? Do you like researching and studying, and why?**

I've always spent minimal time and energy studying, I always do it on the last moment and prioritize pinpointing the most important/useful concepts in the text and being able to understand them and expand on them over actually trying too hard to study and memorize.

Regarding research, if it is something that interests me I can do it, I enjoy learning new stuff certainly and exploring new topics is fun, it's magical to learn about something I don't have wholistic understanding of. That said you won't catch me reading studies or anything, I'm not that into research.

I do verify information though if that counts, usually from multiple sources and comparing them to eachother, looking for consensus or looking for holes in consensus.

* **How many of your own opinions do you form? How often do you do actual thinking on your own, more than just finding an existing answer?**

I can form quite a few opinions based on my own observations, those are usually the more philosophical ones and related to people, I do so based on my own insights and experiences. 

However like I already said I generally do like to consult sources when it comes to external stuff, I recognize my abilities have limits, I'm not as informed about certain stuff as some other people and likewise I can't do calculations or whatever and I understand that. 

I'm also fundamentally a product of my enviroment, a subjective being, therefore I think in pursuit of truth I must reach out to other people. I feel like trusting yourself too much on what you think is a trap.

However there is always element of indepdent/critical thinking involved in this process, I may ask for explanation but I may try to point out inconsistencies, ask for nuances. I never just adopt opinions of other people at face value, I am very careful what I trust and always strive to think indepdently.

* **How often do you talk about concepts or facts? Why exactly do you talk about it, and what do you like talking about most?**

I do like talking about concepts quite a bit, the most mundane things and situations can inspire me to come up with them and I find it interesting. I also like to talk about my conclusions from external world and discuss concepts like that sometimes. As for facts, I only do so to disprove what other people are saying, not in actual arguments though, I dislike arguments, so from distance.

 Why do I talk about that? Well I feel like when I come up with something or come to a conclusion I feel the need to share it and explore it. I never actually care to convince other people though, so I will only debate it with open-minded people I respect.

* **Do you struggle with thinking about things by yourself? Does this bother you, and how much? How well do you handle criticism from others when it comes to your logical concepts or factual knowledge?**

I do not neccesarily struggle to think as much as to stay informed, I don't put enough effort and perhaps I'm not smart enough to understand lot of things, it really depends, certain things are my domain and I can be confident in my thoughts in that area but certain things are not, I'd say I'm generally less confident in this stuff in general.

When it comes to criticism, well if I make a mistake and someone corrects me I ask for a source and if it is legitiamte I will correct myself without any issue. When it comes to making big mistakes I usually avoid making these in the first place, either by not arguing ab something I don't understand or just preparing myself well enough.

* **Did you enjoy answering the above questions? Would you say this is a major part of who you are or your identity? Was it boring? Is it a difficult topic?**

Yeah, I do think it's very interesting. I don't think I'm good in logic but also that I have a lot to say about it. I'm honestly really stuck here because I feel like I rely on outside sources too much to be 3L but also am too skeptical to be 4L so I'm not sure, I hope something useful can be learned here.

And yeah I'd say I care a lot about logic, I care a lot about correctness of information and I judge people who are confidently ignorant.

**E (emotion)**

* **Do you consider yourself a creative person? What do you do that's creative?**

Yes very much so, mostly when it comes to writing or coming up with ideas I can be very creative. I've had many ideas for stories, I've writen lyrics and poetry and generally I'm quick to inspire and have pretty easy time coming up with ideas. It's not neccesarily always super deep and symbolic but I'd still say creativity is one of my stronger sides.

Generally I'd say this is so big for me that I'd like to engage in creative pursuits as my main objective in life and for me Uni is mostly just ""safety net"". Ideally I'd like to be something like a director but that's not really feasible so more realistically I'd aspire to be a writer.

* **How do you feel about expressing your own emotions? Are emotions part of your decision-making at all? How much of a role do they play in your decisions?**

I'm a very emotional person though not neccesarily emotionally expressive. I have good idea of my emotions usually and I have good ammount of control over them. I generally have little trouble expressing most emotions and do so in a measured way. I mostly express positive emotions like enthusiasm and may hide some emotions more though even sad emotions I prefer to express sometimes. Sometimes I even want people to see me sad honestly, as silly as that sounds and I don't really want to hide it, though I can be quite private as well.

Regarding decisionmaking, yes I'd actually say emotions are my private motivator, for me it is important for a decision to ""feel right"" though they need to be supported by rationale too, rationale is subordinated to emotions and I can't break this. 

Sometimes it can happen that I can have conflicting emotions though, usually I come to a decision but worth mentioning I think.

* **How much effort do you put into creating a positive emotional influence on other people? Do you try to do this at all? Do you like exploring the emotions or creativity of others?**

Honestly, while yes I can be the ""therapist friend"" and I do enjoy it quite a bit and I do enjoy motivating my friends too, I generally don't go out of my way to emotionally influence people. My emotions are for me and it can get quite exhausting, even unnatural to deal with emotions of others, especially strong, unsolicited emotions.

* **Do you feel uncomfortable with the idea of sharing your emotions? Do you struggle with knowing exactly how to connect with others on a deeper and more emotional level? Do you struggle with knowing how to go about dealing with and handling your emotions?**

It depends, I can appear either very stoic or very emotionaly expressive, generally though I want people to know how I feel even if I may not act on it and what I stand for, almost at all times. I can sometimes have trouble with some difficult past stuff but generally I can share most emotions quite easily, though I do so in controlled way.

I think it's quite the opposite, I can connect with people on deeper level easily but may have problem with the ""warming up"" and the rituals inbetween. I do however overall have easy time to sympathize with people, though again I don't want to do it at all times.

I don't really know how to answer that honestly, when something bad happens, I may be emotionaly overhwelmed, sometimes it can even be crippling if it's too strong, however I generally try to keep my emotions on a leash.

* **Did you enjoy answering the above questions? Would you say this is a major part of who you are or your identity? Was it boring? Is it a difficult topic?**

This is a big part of my identity yes, I'd say that my emotions are area of confidence for me, though I'm not sure if I did a good job at describing them, feels bit contradictory at times.

**F (physics / foundation)**

* **How much time and energy do you put into your physical health? Do you try new healthcare or self-care products often? How often, and what kinds of products do you like trying?**

It's actually very heavy fluctuation, I can go between knowing and feeling my health problems but ignoring them, straight into fits of hypochodria. I will give an example from time I was younger.

I had this one period for a while where I drank soda way too often, of course I wouldn't want anyone to intrude on it or critize it but I did do it a lot. Now at some point I realised it is a lot and suddenly due to some (completely unrelated) minor health issue, I started believing that I messed up my blood sugar and started panicking and spent like next 4 months running from doctor to doctor, misdiagnosing myself with almost every ilness I could find.

Now I turned out to be fine but the point is, as you can see I was quite fine with having unhealthy lifestyle but at the same time it also cuased me considerable stress.

* **How much do you care about your physical appearance, including fashion choices, or decorating the physical environment for comfort? Do you like exploring the physical environment (food, nature, architecture, etc), or doing physical activity?**

Well I don't consider myself  good looking (not everyone would agree with that but it's my perspective) and if someone asked me to send them a picture of me I would be too insecure but generally I don't spend too much time thinking about it. Of course I'd like to be attractive and I feel good when people find me attractive but I don't put much work into it in all honestly.

Regarding fashion choices, I'm oblivious to mainstream fashion, I wear clothes that are comfortable and reflect certain perception of me I want to create. As an example I like wearing sweaters because they're comfortable, make me look slightly less skinny and make me come off as a ""casual""/""easy-going"" person, I also like to wear coats because I think they look nice and elegant. I don't spend too much time thinking about clothing though.

Regarding food, I find it to be quite mundane topic, I mostly eat for sustinence, more or less at least 2 meals a day, however even then I do have my tastes and I'd rather have lunch that tastes good than not. I'm very conservative in my tastes and could eat the same few foods a lot. I also have my dislikes, like I can't tolerate too much sweets, especially chocolate. 

I do also indulge in some other comforts, I smoke cigars occasionaly, I like warm baths and I always like to be drinking something, be it coffee, tea or something else basically at all times, so I certainly care a bit yes. I like my home too, it's nice and comfortable and warm.

Regarding architecture and nature, yes I do find beauty in them, I don't exactly comprehend how or why I feel that way but I do see physical beauty. I also really like the connection between aesthetics and comfort and atmosphere in general.

* **Do you like talking about your personal tastes often? How often do you explore the personal tastes of others? What about your own health or the health of others? Do you like creating or exploring comfortable environments with others?**

I feel like personal tastes are kinda pointless topic because everyone likes something different, I can't borrow your taste buds and you can't borrow mine, so there's not much to talk about. I do it sometimes as small talk though but to me my tastes are mostly to be taken as a quirk rather than something to share.

I don't really care about personal tastes of others, when it comes to their health I may have picked bit of advice here and there but ultimately I don't like intruding upon other people, let them take care of themselves.

* **Do you stress about what people will think regarding your personal tastes? Do you prefer to follow fashion trends in worry that people may judge your own style? Do you worry about being sick or in poor physical health often? Are you able to take criticism about your health, aesthetic choices, personal tastes, or physical appearance?**

Uh well, I certainly would find it annoying if someone criticized my personal tastes or health, it's not neccesarily that I'm insecure though, it's just nobody's business and I am annoyed by people who try to impose upon others or search for superiority in most mundane things. And again like I said I really don't care about fashion trends either.

Regarding physical health, I also already mentioned it, I either ignore it or obsess over it.

* **Did you enjoy answering the above questions? Would you say this is a major part of who you are or your identity? Was it boring? Is it a difficult topic?**

I'm not sure, it's always so confusing to me, I feel like comfort-seeking plays a large part in my life but I also feel detached from physical enviroments so physicality/sensory in typology systems always confuses me.

**V (volition)**

* **Do you know how to get what you want? How much effort do you put into figuring out how to get what you want? Do you just take action and get started, do you plan, do you research or try to get advice from others?**

I find this question quite puzzling honestly, I don't think I usually conceptualize ""what I want"" at all. Sure there are times, like when seeking relationships I could be persistent and even competetive but in my natural state I think I mostly just flow through things and navigate them as they come.

Regarding taking action, yes I usually like to but the problem is I'm very indecisive, it's actually quite stresfull for me because I want to decide as fast as possible but at the same time I often just don't know what option to choose or what's better, in such situations I would probably seek advice, not neccesarily to convince me but to push me into making a stance for or against something.

* **How often do you feel motivated to work on your future? How often are you busy working on a goal for the future? Do you prefer routine, or often fall into routine? Is your routine making progress on a goal? What makes you change your routine? What makes you start working on a goal?**

I mostly am either indifferent or experience spikes of motivation upon being inspired by something but overall for the most part I don't really actively work on fullfilling some sort of long term plan, that has never been my thing ever. 

I don't really think either statement about routine applies, I never make schedules or plan out my time, nor do I want to conform to outside routine, both seem like pretty depressing choices.

As for what makes me wanna start working on a goal, again it's inspiration, something inspires me and imprints concept into my head and I start to work on that, usually doesn't last enough for me to finish it though.

* **Do you like guiding or helping people reach their goals? What kinds of goals do you prefer to help people with? Are you a leader, or do you prefer to work in groups where you're an equal? How and when do you take charge, if ever?**

Yeah I think I like motivating people, not over the top but somewhat, I also get somewhat frustrated seeing people who do nothing to work on their goals, though I'm not particurarily competent in this area either I suppose.

When it comes to working in groups, I like to take leadership but not by dominance, I'm averse to forcing people into stuff, even convincing people is out of question for me, I want people to do what they will, however I like to assume responsibility for a bit sometimes nd help us put together somethign that works best for everyone,

* **Do you overwork yourself? Do you worry that you might be lazy or that you aren't progressing quickly enough? Does it feel impossible to find the right method forward? Are you able to take criticism over your choices for working towards your goals? How do you respond to being challenged?**

Not usually, if anything I tend to prefer doing bare minimum, unless I'm absolutely immersed in whatever I'm doing. And yeah I suppose I do worry about that, it's not an active worry but with time I realise I haven't done enough for my goals and I never finish anything which makes me worried about being able to secure the future I desire.

Finding right methods doesn't feel impossible but I dislike anything that requires too much logistics, like I see people who are capable of going out of their way to go ""into the field"" and even do experiments or stuff that requires significant mobilization for something as stupid as an essay (I don't have an example rn), while I myself just would rather do a conventional essay with as little actual activity outside of reading as possible.

I really don't think I'd be a huge fan of criticism in this area, like I don't want to be criticized for productivity or my dreams for sure but I don't feel strong reaction when thinking about this, at least not rn.

If I was challenged, depends on what way, I'd probably just assert myself to be left alone, I don't need to convince other people or impose upon them but I don't want to be imposed upon either.

* **Did you enjoy answering the above questions? Would you say this is a major part of who you are or your identity? Was it boring? Is it a difficult topic?**

I'm not sure, I don't think I really got to the core of what I feel like I should've covered, especially my aversion to people trying to push against me, which I think is a part of this entire thing so I don't quite know.

**Additional**

* **Please share any mental or physical health struggles or diagnoses that may affect your answers or how you interact with the world**

I don't think so, not much, I do have anxiety problems and OCD but I don't think either plays a part in here.

* **You may also optionally share a rough age range to help clarify your current life circumstances for anyone reading**

I'm a 23M university student.

So growing up they do tests on me and stuff like that and basically I became the baseline for an entirely new type of cyborg robot things. (I know anime as fuck right?) And through the years I studied well, learned a bunch about science and learned about life above the surface. Those radiated abominations some call 'people' are going and blowing themselves up non-stop up there. I mean literally! Don't get me started with the shit happening in Appalachia over the last few centuries. 

Anyways, so long and short I'm pretty sure that my robots are the key to humanity's future right?

Well the person who transferred me to my adopted parents shot my father, but left my mother in a cooler. (I forgot to mention that part I was frozen for a while.) I thought it only fair that my mother be allowed some vengeance and we'll fuck it I was bored, do you know what there is to do underground? Nothing! 

Anyways I let my mother free and she starts her vengeance mission. I was like 90% sure she was going to be long dead well before getting anywhere, but I find out that that bitch knew how to use power armor! 

Anyways, she goes on a killing spree, ends up killing the man who killed her husband, rips open his brain (like that's normal!) and uses the brain robot parts to track me down! 

I'm like okay chill so she wants to meet her kid that's fine. 

Okay I may have fucked up a little bit here. I put a prototype robot version of my 10 year old self in her path to like try to calm her down before the reunion and she fucks that right up! So I go to talk to her, make her feel at home, give her unrestricted access and I sware this bitch steals every camera, coffee cup, and food tray in my entire community! Them she fucks off and now she has sided with some technofascist military fucks (boomers am I right?) I'm pretty sure she's out to kill me and my entire community.

1g9rh0t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g9rh0t,Replacing diffuser in Breville Barista Express,"Recently, my BES870 started leaking on the bench every time I made a coffee. I opened it up to find a tiny crack in the diffuser. I found several posts questioning how to replace it but no instructions on how to do it. I had a go myself and the machine is running like new again. I wish I had made a video or taken more photos but I really went in not knowing what I was doing and wasn’t prepared. Anyway, I’ll try to re-trace my steps in this post for others that may have the same issue.

Firstly, I went into this comfortable with the idea that the machine had served me well for 8 years and if I stuffed it, I was okay to buy a new one. But I wasn’t that cool with throwing away a perfectly good machine over a $30 part. Nearly every time I thought I could not undo something or work around it, I was wrong. You do have to unplug and unscrew a lot.

Part number: 1674249

1. Start by removing all accessory parts (water tank, bean hopper, drip trays, tamper)
2. Twist and remove the burr grinder
3. Undo the 5 screws at the back of the machine and the 2 screws under the front of the machine (near the tamper store and hot water outlet) so that you can remove the top of the machine. You will need to unplug the cup heater to fully remove the lid.
4. From where the water tank would sit, remove the 3 screws caps and undo the screws to lift the back of the machine off. It’s connected to the water hose which needs to be detached by 2 difficult to reach screws.
5. Undo 2 screws on the top of the front face to be able to partially remove the front panel with all of the buttons and pressure gauge. This will stay attached but needs to be moved a bit out of the way.
6. Take off the steam wand so that the steam/hot water switch can be removed; it can’t fit through the hole if it’s still attached. The thin part of the stem under the large nut has some grooves. Use pliers to grip this and twist off the wand. Don’t undo the large nut.
7. Unplug all of the unpluggable wires. There are two attached with screws that I needed to also take off.
8. Undo the screws for the main part of machine. There are 2 at the top, around 4 on the base, and 2 in the back behind the solenoid valve.
9. Undo the 3 screws for the steam/hot water switch
10. The machine and the steam/hot water switch have to kind of be lifted at the same time to get the switch out of the way. I also had to detach 2 hoses to get this to work. I think one connected the steam to the pump and the one that connected the pressure gauge to the machine.
11. I was then able to tilt the machine enough to reach and undo the 2 screws at the back of the diffuser. The bottom outlet of the diffuser also has a rubber plug that was fiddly to get back in later.
12. The diffuser is now loose and can be detached from the 3 hoses and replaced.

Now, let me tell you, this wasn't just another project. It was a journey. A journey where I wrestled with code, danced with APIs, and yes, even had a few late-night coffee sessions with my trusty laptop. Here's what I covered:

\- **Why Django and React?** Well, because they're like the peanut butter and jelly of web development. They just work together, seamlessly. - **Ollama?** That's right, I threw in a bit of machine learning magic to make things even more interesting. 

\- **The xAI API?** This is where things got really fun. Integrating AI into your apps isn't just about making them smarter; it's about opening up a world of possibilities. I've always believed that sharing knowledge is the key to growth, both personally and professionally. So, in this post, I've laid out: 

\- **The setup process** \- because let's face it, getting started can be a bit like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded. 

\- **The integration challenges** \- and trust me, there were plenty. But hey, overcoming challenges is what makes us better, right? 

\- **The results** \- and how this integration can revolutionize your projects. If you're curious about how to make your web applications not just functional but also intelligent, give it a read. And hey, if you've got your own experiences or questions, drop them in the comments. Let's geek out together! Remember, in the world of tech, we're all students and teachers.

Today she said my liver enzymes were at a 71 when I saw her 3 months ago. Today….. they are at a 32!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don’t know exactly what that means but I know the lower the better. 

I also came in today having lost 20 lbs!!!! I was 232 3 months ago and now I’m 210. 

I am over the moon excited today! Left beaming and I just wanted to share with people that would understand why I’m so happy. 

Sadly I forgot to fast yesterday when I came in for blood work so we don’t know the results of my cholesterol yet because I just had that bloodwork done right before my appointment today but hopefully those will show good as well. 

She told me it’s rare that she tells people to loose weight and eat better and that they actually come back having done it. She was shocked in a good way. I told her that she’s been telling me to lose weight for years and I haven’t done it. But once I knew I had the fatty liver and that if I didn’t change it would eventually be irreversible I think that kick started something in my brain saying I really do need to change. 

So she asked me what I’ve changed…. I told her the following… 

If I go out to eat or even eating at home, I try to be more mindful of the portion size. I used to go out to eat and would force myself to finish the plate but they give such big portions in America so now I stop once I feel full and I’ll take the rest home or just leave it. 

Also I try not to boredom snack as much anymore and only snack on something when it’s between meals and I actually feel a bit hungry. 

I’ve also tried to cut down how often I get fast food. I was going daily because of convenience. Especially on work days I’d be gone 12 hours so I’m like I don’t have time to cook at home and would just get fast food. I still get fast food now but I try to limit how often I do and on a day that I do get fast food I try to manage my calories for the rest of my meals better to compensate for the high calories of the fast food. I also try to get options at fast food that are slightly healthier nutritional facts wise. Like if I go somewhere like chick fil a that offers salt free fries as an option I always choose that now. 

Second to last I’ve been drastically cutting back on how much sugar I eat/drink. I haven’t had soda in like 5 years BUT I really like my sugary coffee drinks. When I go to get a coffee I get sugar free instead of full sugar now. I have also started to choose to buy savory things for snacks at home and not buy the sugary snacks. If I do want a sweet treat at home I’ll make them myself. Like some sugar free cookies for instance and I’ll sweeten them with either allulose, monk fruit or stevia. 

Lastly while I have not been specially counting my calories to a T and writing it all down I do check the nutritional facts for everything I buy at the grocery store or get when I go out to eat. 

These are the changes I’ve made and what seen to be working for me. I really hope I’m able to keep this up and continue to see improvements but for today I am so happy. 

Thanks for listening and I hope you all are figuring this fatty liver shit out too and making positive changes.

How do I handle this?,"I’ve been in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (26M) for 2 years. I visit him every few months but lately we have been more arguments.The main issue is that we have different ways of spending quality time. He prefers staying home,. I don’t expect to go out every day, but I’d love to do something together at least once a week when I visit. For him, staying in saves time so he can work more on his side project as he plans to launch his own startup soon. Also currently we both are earning well enough. 

We both work full-time, and weekends are our only time together, but I feel that he often prioritizes his work. Recently, I’ve felt more like a secondary priority, which is exhausting. For example, on our anniversary, we couldn’t go out because of his urgent work ( I get this as I come from the same field). He brought me roses and chocolates, which I really appreciated. But I had put a lot of thought into his gifts, and while it didn’t hurt me, it did make me wish he’d taken a bit more time or effort in return.

Last weekend, we planned to go out at 5 PM, but he didn’t finish working until 7. I waited, ready to go, and only left when I said I’d go alone. When we finally went out, he wasn’t really interested; he sat outside while I browsed. Seeing other couples enjoying their time together made me feel jealous. He mentioned he doesn’t enjoy shopping—but he’d try to go out for me, even though he probably wouldn’t have a good time. I feel tired due to this situation as it feels like he constantly has work on his mind. He has also suggested me to not compare his work and our relationship as both are different things. He believes sacrifices must be made now so we can have a better life. I am starting to feel somewhat frustrated day by day. I just want to make beautiful memories with him, have new experiences. 

He’s generally a caring person. He makes me coffee every morning and provides emotional support when I’m down. But these small things, like always prioritizing work and not knowing what I’d like, are starting to bother me. I understand he’s working hard for our future, but now that he’s said he doesn’t enjoy going out and prefers staying home to work, I’m wondering if we’re truly compatible.

 https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/NRqUwQzRLq

I'm 22(F), my ex is 22(M), we've been in a relationship for 6 years. My ex changed the age in the previous post due to personal protection. 

Here I'll tell you my version. The relationship had its beautiful moments in 2018, 2019, 2020. In 2020 we had a long distance relationship. At the end of 2021 we moved in together, the adaptation of living together was complicated, communication was dying transformed into daily arguments. I had an overdose on my part because I couldn't accept what happened. 2022 was a little calmer but the problems continued. 2023 was horrible, lies and deception on both sides. We CHEAT to each other. 

He decided to fight for me.

At the end of 2023, he gave me a promise ring, and in February of this year, I found a diary where he confirmed that he had cheated on me with his ex-best friend. Something in me died that day. I ended the relationship 4-5 months after this. We were still living together.

I started using marijuana daily to deal with the pain of 4 wisdom teeth and the movement in my teeth. I started having psychotic attacks from using so much. 

I convinced myself that my family hated me and that my ex-partner had more women. I distanced myself from everyone and thought they were judging me. After 3 months of the relationship ending, I physically attacked my ex 3 times. I have no excuses, what I did was very wrong. 

After those attacks, I started looking for therapy, I have followed the advice of my psychologist. I had to move because I did not feel comfortable and I was on alert all the time. I continue to seek therapy. 

I continue trying to be better every day. 

Despite so many years in the relationship, we got off on the wrong foot. I had my expectations too high, obscuring reality. There were times when I inconsistently obscured my ex's feelings, and times when I hurt him so he would know how it felt. There was deceit and lies on both sides, in the midst of all that we continued to meet and love each other. We never sought therapy together, I didn't want to or he didn't want to...

I made the decision to leave the state because I'm staying with an aunt, and in this place there is drug use and problems.
I have a cousin who offered me help, he lives in North Carolina. 

I made the decision to leave because everything is confusing. My ex has anxious attachment and has told me twice that he is going to get me pregnant before I leave. He told me that no matter where I go, he should look for me. When he confessed to me that he made a post here on Reddit about the situation, I already knew, I was taking all the blame. 

That night I walked away super frustrated, he asked me for forgiveness.

Here I leave you my part and it is not to hurt him, because deep down I have faith to fix things because I love him and I do not want to lose him. 

I deserve respect, a clear answer. 

It is not okay to ask third parties for ADVICE when they DO NOT know, talk to artificial intelligence to ask for advice???, put on a movie to reflect?????? Speak clearly. 

I need a clear answer. If you can not forgive me, I will understand. Be a clear person and even if it is difficult, you must make difficult decisions for your well-being. The only reason I want to leave is because I feel that my ex has power over me, and he has shown me with mixed signals. 

I love you, but this is not what I want. What I did is already done, and if you are going to point at me and treat me badly every time you talk to me, you will push me further away. If you can not forgive me, I understand and respect that. It is still offensive that you put unknown third parties to give their opinion on a situation in which you play the victim and change the story in your favor. We BOTH were very wrong. 

Talking about pregnancy and sexual comments while we are in this situation makes me feel used. You don't want me for yourself but you don't want to let me go either. I have been with you because you are drowning in a deep depression and even though I try to get close to help you, your words penetrate my heart consecutively. If you know that you cannot forgive me, let me go. Let me start from 0 in a state and learn from my mistakes. I was very immature, and I still have a long way to go to consider myself mature, I am grateful to my aunt but this is not my environment to heal.



I won't lie to you, in my heart I have faith that you are my person. To be your wife and have your children in my womb. But this is not the way, and you are not obligated to be part of my life, I need a clear answer. For now I keep moving away for my well-being and self-love. I look you in the eyes and I still believe that it is you. Let's be clear; let's have a coffee, let's come to a conclusion, it would make me less hurt to know that I HAVE a clear answer.

A little bit about me: I'm a 2022 college grad who moved to the city soon after graduating and have been here since. 

The last two jobs I've held were customer success roles at tech companies. The first was more about upselling, renewal rates, managing a portfolio of clients, etc. and the most recent job has been more traditional tech support (helping people use our software).

Both jobs were stressful and time consuming in their own ways. The former having an unattainable quota and the latter an on call component where you had to answer customers before and after normal work hours.   

As I approach the ancient age of 25, I am curious to hear about the experiences of other people in the city who work jobs that allow them to work on side projects, fulfill other goals, or simply have a solid work-life balance. I know they are out there as my two brothers are working union AV jobs that are pretty chill, but they aren't hiring.   
  
I have graphic design projects that I would love to work on and I figure now is the time to take a different route or role that allows me to develop my skills and build out what I have in mind. I'm willing to take a massive pay cut. My last two roles paid well but weren't worth the mental toil. 

I'd love to hear any thoughts, wisdom, or experiences people have had in the comments below.   
I live in alphabet city and I'm also happy to meet for a coffee or a drink if anyone is willing to discuss further!

","I'm a 31yo who has hopped between jobs and industries frequently for the last 10 years. Have been into coffee as a side hobby for about 4 years, stumbled upon a roastery packing job last year. Quickly promoted to production roaster and I've been roasting for about 9 months now, pushing out around 100 X 30kg roasts per week.

**Pros**

* Boss is paying for a couple SCA roasting and sensory courses this year.
* Love working in this environment where I'm constantly learning new things about coffee and being able to sample roast and cup brand new coffee's on a regular basis.
* It's a small company and I get along with everyone I work with.
* I'm able to be exposed to other parts of the industry such as importing and green trading, going to trade shows (it's a London based roastery where the scene is very active.etc).
* Potential to crack on, keep my head down, network and perhaps get a future job at an importer or a higher level role at a larger roastery.

**Cons**

* Pay is shite with not much room for progression in my current company.
* Would like to get a mortgage at some point in my life which coincides with the pay being shite
* Whenever I read about advice on working in the industry, the response is typically ""Don't, the pay is shite"".
* If I'm roasting for another 5 years I'm pretty sure my back will give out.
* Ummmmmm did I mention the industry is underpaid to shite ?

In conclusion, this is the first job I've had where I can see longevity in the industry as I'm really interested in what we're producing and in the industry in general. I can see myself continuing to gain new qualifications and maybe going for my Q grader qual some day. It's just a shame that the industry is underpaid as a whole. I know there are decent paid jobs out there but they are few and far between. Love my job, I have keys to the roastery and live down the road so I have access to cup coffee's and train my sensory skills whenever I want out of hours. Maybe if I work hard enough then I can get a role where I'm paid sufficiently to live and I can enjoy my job.

The hardest part for me is cutting out nicotine. I've never smoked a cigarette, but I've been vaping for almost 5 years now and it's a hard habit to break when you have a very dependent personality, such as I do.

And then my husband made a suggestion, while it's still not good they do make zero nicotine flavored vape juice. That being said, while I do still vape it is 0 nicotine and I have gone about 7 days now without a relapse into nicotine. I know it's not much but I kinda wanted to share.

1g9qt81,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/1g9qt81/visiting_in_november/,Visiting in November,"Hi everyone!

My husband and I will be visiting in early November. Neither of us have ever been to the area, but we are looking forward to it! I had a couple of questions, which I'm researching on my own, too, but it's nice to get info from multiple sources.

* **Fly Fishing:** My husband likes to fish, specifically fly fishing. All the companies I've seen are about $500 for a half day so I suppose that's the going rate. With price seemingly the same across the board, is there a company you'd recommend over the others?



* **Co-working Space:** On the first day of our trip, my husband will need to work. Since we can't check into our VRBO until 3pm, we are looking for a co-working space with a daily pass (not a monthly membership). I found one, The Common Desk - it's about 30 minutes from the area. That's fine, but I'm wondering if there are any other co-working spaces closer to Carolina Beach OR if there are any great coffee shops in Carolina Beach that are good for working (i.e. not as crowded/loud/etc)?
   * We may consider asking our VRBO host if we can check in any earlier that day so that he can work from the condo, but that's not a guarantee and we understand that. Looking for backup plans (co-working space, coffee shop) if need be.



* **Carolina Beach Boardwalk:** We know we are visiting during the off-season (life just worked out that way - we wanted to see the beach this year and this is the only time we can do it). Is the boardwalk totally closed down this time of year? Is ANYTHING on the boardwalk open? We likely wouldn't ride the rides anyway, but any games/shops/restaurants that might still be open? Is it available for you to even walk around the boardwalk or, if it's closed for the season, do they prohibit you from even going on it in the first place? 
   * I've heard pretty mixed reviews about the boardwalk, with a lot of them leaning negative. We understand that it likely will be touristy, overpriced, and (according to reviews) rundown and in need of some TLC. Just thought we'd check it out if anything there is open, but this isn't a make or break for us. 



* **Restaurants:** Give me your best recs! Unfortunately, my husband is deathly allergic to shellfish so that limits our options (I know, why are we visiting the beach then? Again... because we want to!). We're open to most types of food and are fine with a mix of high end and hole in the wall places. We'd like a good steakhouse one night if possible.



* **Activities in general:** Honestly, we kind of just want to chill. Read a book on the beach depending on the weather. Sit on the condo balcony and enjoy some wine. Whatever. BUT we also want to plan a few things as well. We don't want to overload ourselves, but we'd like a few things on the schedule that will get us out and about. Any recommendations (in addition to fly fishing recs mentioned above) for:
   * Ferry rides
   * Sunset boat cruises
   * Museums and/or history related things (inside or outside)
   * Any other noteworthy things to do in the area!

I know I'm asking a lot in one post so I appreciate any guidance or recommendations you have! Thank you so much.",1,1729625477.0,NorthCarolina,0,1.0,False

I always like to start off with some of my biggest flaws/turn offs for people. I don't like dogs. Please do not message me if you have a dog. I'm very sensitive to dogs. Specifically small, lap dogs. Big ones don't freak me out as much, but if you've ever seen Supernatural, there's this episode where Dean is running and screaming away from this little dog. That's me. I'm also chubby and very content with being chubby. I'm bipolar. I love gossip. I'm infertile (related to the being chubby thing - proud member of the PCOS club). If any of these scare you off, please feel free to not message!! Now onto me overly long essay where I spend way too much time rambling about nonsense and why you should choose me as a partner. 

For a really long time, I have pushed down and aside one of life's biggest, most hard-hitting truths: women are just better. I find us more attractive, I find the way we love more appealing, I love everything about us. And yet, for all twenty three years of my life I have hesitated. I'm bisexual. I know that scares some people. But I've been this way for as long as I can remember. The very first time I experienced attraction was at like five and it was with when the iconic Monica Belluci had her boobs laced up tight in this gorgeous medieval-ish red dress (Brothers Grimm). And that attraction soon extended towards Dracula's brides in Van Helsing. Shakira, but specifically Shakira in the She Wolf music video. Almost any Helena Bonham Carter role. I could make Mrs. Lovett happy I swear 😭 

And yet, despite this. I've never actually dated a woman. I've technically been with one once, but it wasn't the best experience and it put me off continuing my experimentation, so to speak. But, I did something tonight that really made me ponder on what I wanted in life. I may or may not have participated in a fake discord wedding with myself as one of the brides. It was a joke. One of those things that online friends do when bored. It was really fun. And yet all I could think of was, I would really love to do this one day with someone. And not with a man. And make no mistake, I am not a lesbian in denial. I wish my sexuality were a bit more straightforward than what I got stuck with (standing by this pun). I do like men, but I really do love the beauty women bring into my life. 

I really, truly want to embrace this side of myself more, or at least be given the chance to. I'm not looking for a throuple or a fling. Though, I don't know if I'd be too against the former. It would just be new. I am not a particularly jealous person when given proper communication. I would love to get the chance to make some crazy girl on here really happy. Unlike my younger self, my taste has evolved past sultry with hints of unhingedness. I love people with whimsy. Women who embrace witchiness, or their inner goth, or their cottage core loving selves, or even their true place in society as some nature faerie scouring the woods in search of edible mushrooms. Or someone who is like all of these in one. Why? Because I am the exact same way.  

Unfortunately, I'm stuck in horrible, nightmarish Mississippi. 95 percent of the people here are NOT like me. OR they knew me in school. Or something equally embarrassing. It's why I'm here. 

As said above, I'm 23. A leo sun with a libra moon and virgo rising. Gemini venus with a sagittarius mars. I love astrology, getting my tarot cards read, watching bae put spells on people. I myself am not a witch. I just love the vibes, but feel too irresponsible to ultimately mess with the forces of the universe. I love womanhood. And sisterhood. And boobs. I need a woman who is NOT afraid to be weird. I am weird. I need someone like me. I'm not one of those opposites attract type of people. 

I'm kind of sort of a librarian. A public one. Without a degree. So, you know, not ALA recognized, but the public sees me as one? They’ll have to rip the title from me right out from my cold, dead hands. 

I am a MASSIVE book and fanfiction nerd. I read romances primarily, fantasy secondary, and history as the third big one. I love like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter and uh niche (and often queer) shows like Renegade Nell, Gentleman Jack, What We Do in the Shadows, Good Omens, Our Flag Means Death etc. Almost all of these have not been allowed to reach their full potential. Sadly. I adore music as well. Mazzy Star, Lana Del Rey, Kate Bush, and so many, many, MANY more. 

I love history and food. And I would loooove to take up cooking and or baking as a hobby one day. I might be terrible at cleaning, but I really want to make up for it by being a decent cook ♥️ I love the idea of going on museum dates, coffee dates, bookstore dates, a trip to the local witchy apothecary that definitely tries to cheat us out of our money for plants you could find in the woods outside your house, or to the ren faire, or the actual fair. I want a slightly codependent best friend who may or may not be my lover from time to time. I don't mind people on the asexual spectrum either. I can take care of my own business in that way. I love horror movies as well. Halloween is my favorite, next to Christmas. The fall and winter in general is just top tier. 

I love late night phone calls - and while I can't text as much during the day (got caught 😔 I wasn't sneaky enough at work) - I do love spending time well into the late night if possible (if I don't up and pass out). I want to be actively pursuing you - and for that level of reciprocation to be returned to some extent. I guess that makes me the more dominant one (I definitely prefer to be). My love languages are quality time and gift giving. Words of affirmation is a third. I love to compliment, but don't really care for it in regards to myself. Let me smother you with affection ❤️ I'm poor (unfortunately, it comes with the whole being a librarian thing) BUT gift giving (when I remember to do it) is my specialty. I mean I suck at wrapping, but I can assure you - you will be happy. I just love making people happy. 

My age range is between 20 and 30. I don't have many physical preferences. I'm not really into shaved heads or gauges. I would prefer a more “feminine” style. I feel so picky already. Like myself, I’m either in sweat shirts and house shorts or I'm clad in a dress or a pinafore. I don't even do my make up. So like I don't expect more effort than me or anything like that!! I just love cute stuff and someone who will be able to appreciate cute things with me. I would prefer you to be employed. I don't really care as what. Down to be poor together. I'd be open to moving or vice versa (nobody sane wants to live in Mississippi, so risking that would definitely assure me that you're not normal 😭). 

Oh. This is a big one. Despite my LIBERAL/LEFT LEANING views, I do want some traditional things. I want a wife. I want a child (or multiple) sometime in the future. It's not a deal breaker for me if it doesn't end up happening, especially if I love someone. But it is a want that I do have. It can be adoption, it can be doner, etc. It really doesn't matter to me. I would prefer you to not be a parent already. I think I'd be okay if it were just one. I'm not sure though. So if you really feel you and I would make a great team, give it a shot! But be warned that I AM unsure and that it might not work out for that reason. 

Anyways, if you've made it this far! Please go ahead and message me! I'll try and respond as soon as I am able.

I will be direct and honest but I will take into account your feelings. I think conversation is a skill and I love it. I’m practicing everyday. I love learning languages, French, Japanese, German (on Duolingo). I love writing and filmmaking, doing a course on that

I’ve spent a lot of time working on myself over the past few relationships I’ve had. Ive poured my heart out to broken women I would have given the world for. It’s in my nature to take care of someone for life but I feel like my efforts have been misguided. I’ve tried to care for people who needed professional help.

I will admit it has damaged my self esteem. But I’m working on it, as am I in all aspects of life. I’ve suffered a terrible accident but it has just made me more determined and driven to do things I can’t do. And currently, that’s to find a beautiful loving girlfriend. Maybe that’s you.

Enough about me. I want to get to know you. Who are you? What are you passionate about? What are you looking for? Tell me about you.

My list of preferences (although i don’t see this as a checklist more just things I like)
• light features (blonde, light skin) you blondes are gorgeous 
• if you’re from uk and family is from an Asian country or Mauritius (similar culture)
• around 5’5 or shorter 
• artistic interests like music, film, writing, drawing, graphic design (we can talk about those)
• loves TV and stuff we can watch together like sitcoms, drama etc

Musts:
• must be willing to form a connection in person (coffee date maybe?)
• values honesty and communication 

Please kindly pop up with your age, gender and a recent picture. If you’re not comfortable sending a picture on Reddit, I understand, just send me your snapchat, discord or whatever you use most regularly! 

No OF models please.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I’m looking forward to us connecting <3 I hope that I can be what you are looking for in a long term partner too X

1g9qn33,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCL/comments/1g9qn33/ncl_jade_detailed_review_102024/,NCL Jade (detailed review 10/2024),"Just returned from a sixthman cruise on the Jade. Here's my very long notes on it.

TLDR: it was clean but otherwise meh

Also, I'm not sure what is NCL and what is due to Sixthman (although I guess NCL owns both now) but take that into account for this experience.

Rooms: the room was newer (ship was refurbished in 2022). Our room looked in person as it did in a yt video walkthrough of the room type (unobstructed ocean view). Aside from a missing outlet (eu) it didn't show any signs of wear. There was an ashtray in the bathroom and a ""no smoking in bed"" sign which I assume are from long ago, so I guess they didn't totally refurbish everything but there was no smell of smoke in the room. The room was in really good shape. Our room had a pull down bunk and a trundle which we ended up not needing. The bunk was very roomy and it would have been akin to an rv overhead bed situation if we had needed to use it. If we had opened the trundle it would have taken up the whole width of the room, a la family bed style. Not sure if there'd even be a gap and you'd lose the nightstands I assume.

Speaking of nightstands, they had shelves and a light and one or two usb ports (1A maybe as they were slow to charge my phone). Bed was comfortable (avoiding the middle seam to join the beds) and the 4 pillows were nice and assorted in firmness. I woke up with no back or neck pain which is unusual. They aren't Marriott beds but come close. Also in the room was a desk/makeup area with a little round seat. The desk has an outlet and a light and a missing circle that must have had an eu outlet at one time.

The rest of the room is how I saw on the yt walkthrough so just to add a few things to the visual walkthrough:

* we brought an over the door shoe pocket thing to put stuff in, but ending up not needing it. The room had a LOT of cubbies. There's at least 12 cubbies/shelves (plus 2 or 3 more in the bathroom and 1 shelf in the closet) for putting items of all sizes and that is in addition to the 6 full sized drawers (three on each side of the room). So for 2 people we didn't even use all our cubbies so we didn't need the shoe pocket thing.
* we also brought a cruise-acceptable extension cord that we did not need. There were three outlets (fourth outlet was missing in our cabin) and a bunch of usb ports to charge. Since we didn't get internet we didn't have multiple laptops or ipads with heavy use so the outlets were sufficient for just charging our phones and one laptop. We did not need or use our extension cord.
* closet had a mini shelf that folded down if needed and 10 or 12 hangers with half having clips for pants. They come on and off but the ring stays in there. Plenty of room if you wanted to bring a garment bag with your own hangers. Room for shoes in closet. Our empty suitcases fit under the bed even with the trundle under one bed.
* No room iron but it did have a hair dryer by the desk.
* Bathroom: has sliding doors between the sink and shower and sink and toilet. It would have been more useful to frost the doors between the sink, shower and the toilet, it does have lines on the door but offers no real privacy inside the bathroom to each of the components. There is shampoo and body wash but no hair conditioner. There is a clothesline for hanging items above the shower. Water pressure was good. The functionality of turning the water in the shower on was not intuitive. It has two ""handlebar"" type knobs. To turn on, twist the left side. To adjust temperature, twist the right side. I think hotter was twisting it towards you. There's two or three shelves above the sink. Our sink stopper came fully out, so if you are a ""dropper"" of earrings or such I would either keep the stopper in it or lay down a washcloth so stuff doesn't get lost down the drain. Head/toilet was cruise style and noisy. I could hear neighboring toilets somewhat in our room but not enough to wake me.
* There's a mini fridge that I think just had water in there, but there was room for us to put things in there without requesting it be emptied. The prices looked good on the mini bar but I believe they all include an extra 9.95 room service fee, so take that into account if you order for the mini bar. They do specials by the day so you can't bulk up day one to avoid the extra delivery fee.
* There's a typical hotel style room safe.
* Outside the door there's a wheel for ""do not disturb"", ""make up room"", ""turn down room"", ""welcome"" and I'm not sure if there's a fifth choice. ""Turn down room"" did not go noticed. We did not receive turn down service despite selecting it each later afternoon. And we did not receive any towel animals. Friends in another area DID receive both turn down and animal towels, so it sounds like it's a hit or miss thing. We did not ask our porter to do the towel animals so I don't know what his response would have been. We did ask for extra towels and a robe. Received the latter but I grabbed the former off the cart and tucked in a drawer to use for my hair drying. Our porter did not introduce himself to us nor did he interact with us. Someone somewhere said they are now cleaning 22 rooms instead of 15. If that's true, then NCL is downgrading that service.
* Despite no turn down (only one clean a day) or cute towel animals, our room was cleaned in a timely manner which is what I care most about. I like the room cleaned when we leave in the morning, same with hotels. I don't like coming in at 3 in the afternoon to wet towels and a messy bed. (Yeah, I can make my own, but that's what I'm paying $500+ a day for in my mind).So our porter was great on that, he got right in when he saw us leave and it was spotless when we got back. A+ on cleanliness.

Food:

* Because of the sixthman theme, one of the MDR (Alizar) was reserved the entire cruise for the entertainment and sixthman staff. There was a permanent guard at the door to that MDR. This meant that the other MDR, Grand Pacific, got very backed up, especially the first night. Many times there was only the buffet and osheehan's open for meals.
* We ate at OSheehans, Grand Pacific mdr, Great Outdoors, Garden Cafe and Jasmine Garden. We didnt do specialty dining.
* I don't know if the Garden Cafe refreshes food so often that they just disregard safe food temps, or what, but nothing I ate up there was hot. I had to assume they knew what they were doing but it did make me nervous. The Great Outdoors food was hot but very limited in what they had and when they were open. I only went to Great Outdoors before noon and it was the same everyday but a nice option and the back outdoor area was nice seating. The MDR pasta and potstickers were good. The chicken picatta was good. The MDR steak was chewy. The corned beef hash just seemed like cubed potatoes and old disgarded cubed steak. Pizza and fries were not very good.  OSheehans offers English and American breakfast and three different menus for each time of day. Osheehans is our NCL favorite go to, it always is so under utilized especially on the Jade where it's somewhat tucked away on the 8th floor so I think many don't know about it or remember it's there. We never had to wait for a table at OSheehans and the service was good, although the servers don't really come back after the food arrives to check on drinks, I noticed.
* Overall I'd say the food was Golden Corral quality. Some of the selections were ambitious and there was a nice selection of different ethnic food types. The temperature issue was not a problem in MDR or Osheehan's, I only noticed room temp food at the Garden Cafe (and at all times there). Late night at the Garden Cafe was very very limited. I don't think they refilled anything, just waited for people to eat whatever was there. There were chicken wings and a couple other sandwiches after 11 and not much else. It said it was open until 2 am but on the two nights I went it was very limited at 11. The final night the bar up in the garden cafe closed before I went up.
* Overall we weren't impressed with the food. Most of the time only 2 restaurants were open except for lunch and dinner so options were limited. Bread was not great. Dessert was fluffy but good and very varied.
* On debarkation day the MDR is open 630-830a (at least that day for us) and was near empty. It was a great end to our trip to have breakfast and I'm not sure if people knew it would be open for breakfast.

Drinks:

* our sixthman included the soda package and we upgrade to the starbucks package. The garden cafe ran out of soda multiple times. Other bars were a bit slow on all service.
* I think there were many staff on the ship that were new as both at bars and restaurants we encountered staff that was unfamiliar with most everything. I'd say 60% of the staff did not know the menu (even simple questions) so I think it had just turned over a lot of staff. This may account for the slow service at most bars.
* Starbucks was a total bust. The guy running it seemed like he was seething with rage constantly. Probably because he was there like 14 hours a day, but that also meant you couldn't avoid him. He was always angry at the two other women working, it was awful. They wouldn't let you order two drinks on a badge, so be sure to bring all badges with you when you go to order. (Bars allow two drinks at a time so Idk why java cafe is different). Specialty coffee was weak, we requested extra shot of espresso each time but never received it. They did not offer the chai latte at all and he was rude when I asked about it. They ran out of ""flavored milk"" so no coconut milk, either.  The line in the mornings was over an hour long so if you want to avoid it go before like 730 or lose an hour each day. The boat had coffee dispensers set up near the java cafe so they knew the line thing was getting complaints I guess. Considering they wouldn't fulfill what we ordered, very lengthy lines, bad vibes, and not having chai latte or tea and other menu items all week, we would have been better off not getting the sbux package and just paying for it if we saw no line.
* On the flip side, we screwed up by not getting the drink package. I looked at the prices and figured we wouldn't be drinking 8 drinks a day to make it worthwhile. What I didn't realize was the shots they pour are about .5 oz. They use a jigger, and don't even pour to the .75 oz line even when right in front of you. The drinks are SO WEAK. The beers are all 12 oz and Blue Moon and Stella are about the only decent ones. And I didn't see any Draft beer, but I heard one place did have draft, maybe the casino area. The mixed drinks and specialties were good, but again, so weak. So 8 drinks are $10 each after service fee but only as strong as 4 normal drinks when it comes to strength. Even though we were paying out of pocket (no package) we still got terrible pours. When we went ashore in Nassau they said they hear that all the time. (In Nassau head to Bearded Clam for shots and Kaliks at a cheap price). We wouldn't have cared about the pour size with a package, but paying $8-16 plus a $2 service charge per drink and it's so weak means you are spending a lot for next to no alcohol.  We didn't bring wine onboard but I wish we would have brought two reds each and made sangria even with the corking fees.

Activities

* Shows: since this was a sixthman cruise none of the normal jade shows were available. The sixthman scheduling was not great and we ended up missing activities just because of the days they scheduled things. So that's our own fault and sixthman in how they set up the schedule and I won't blame NCL for that.
* The shows that were scheduled, the venues don't hold many people. So not everyone can attend a show. Only about 1/4 of who wanted to attend, could. Sixthman split us into groups a and b but we needed four groups because on each thing half the people couldn't get in. I don't know why they thought a ship with 2400 fans would be okay with just 800 of them being able to see the show or group they came on the boat to see. The math didn't math. At. All.
* Casino: i just did slots and lost my money fast. Minimum bet for most machines was 88c and many were much higher. I liked the range of types of slots they had but the return rate was really low. The casino itself was smaller.
* Pool area was packed, of course, but they did mark two hot tubs as for adults for our cruise. There was available seating most of the time somewhere on the pool deck or the two upper decks that overlooked the pool, so that was very good, even with the people that save chairs but never show up. The pools are about ankle deep on the sides and then a deeper middle, so that design was good for people just wanting to wade.
* One day it was really windy and choppy and it was tough to find a spot outside that didn't try to take your stuff and hat right off but that was only one day
* People complained about runners on the walking track. The jogging track is a different floor but no one seems to patrol this.
* There's a fitness room that wasn't crowded with plenty of equipment. Also other sport areas.
* Our themed cruise had a merch area by the java cafe in the atrium. There were also the typical art and jewelry shopping. They routed some events through the stores. Maybe if the cruise lines team up with Ross or TJMaxx they might interest me
* We skipped Bingo as the shirt they do isn't themed and just an ncl shirt.

Ports:

* our ports were Nassau and Great Stirrup Cay
* Nassau: has improved since we were there 5 or so years ago. Now they have cute little huts and shops so  you don't have to leave the general area. It's a bit of a walk off the pier but a courtesy tram does run frequently. The pirate draft beer place was understaffed and people were mad in there (customers and staff). I can't remember the last place where the servers mostly all seems to actively dislike the customers so much as Nassau. The fort and the wicker thing looked worth checking out next time.
* Stirrup Cay got cancelled due to weather. I went on to the Jade day 1 looking for the kiosks to reserve my tender, but was told they don't have kiosks. At stirrup cay they tender off people with excursions first and the rest is first-come-first-served after that. Luckily it didn't matter but that seems like a cluster show of a way to set up tender times.

I think that's most of what I want to remember for next time if I go again. Feel free to ama

  
ETA: we didn't get the internet package. The messaging app was not working, many people complained, others just paid for internet. It was a big hassle not being able to message. I saw on here afterwards that maybe there's a new work around to get the paid messaging work. Others said there is a new app and an old app and they are between both so neither work. We couldn't get our iphones to work at all and the android worked somewhat for the app. No iphone message or ncl paid messaging worked. I had my cell phone do the daily pass in Nassau and used it as a hotspot that day. It connected for the second day, but then stirrup cay got cancelled and they moved the ship away from the cell network so that was a waste of a second day, I should have turned my phone off at the end of the first 24 hour pass and waited to turn back on the next day. Oh well, lesson learned. ",2,1729625060.0,NCL,7,1.0,False

Every day unfolds like the last. This consistency is what I thought I wanted.  I have a family, a steady job, and a house in a quiet neighborhood. But lately, an unease gnaws at me—a quiet rebellion against the predictability of my life.

The morning begins as always. My alarm blares at 6:30, and “Lovely Day” by Bill Withers seeps into the air, too cheerful, almost mocking. My wife greets me with her usual warmth, her sleepy voice asking, “Good morning, honey, how’d you sleep?” But today, her voice feels off, like a recording played too many times, worn thin at the edges. Our two children burst into the room, as they always do, their voices just a bit too shrill: “Good morning, Daddy!” I should smile, but my face feels stiff like someone else is pulling the strings.

I shuffle to the kitchen, the ritual continuing—two scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and coffee so bitter it’s like drinking dirt. My stomach churns, but I force it down. I head to work, my routine as fixed as the sunrise thats blinding me as I drive. I sit at the same red light. The impatient honk from the black Toyota Camry behind me is louder today, almost aggressive. The light turns green. I drive to Chancey's Butcher House, where the greying black lab barks its three staccato notes from across the street—each bark sharper, more urgent than the last.

Inside, the stench of blood hits me, a heavy metallic odor that clings to my clothes, my skin. Hunter, my supervisor, approaches like clockwork, minutes after the start of my shift. His eyes dull, mouth moving robotically: “How are the wife and kids doing?” The words seem to echo, bouncing off the walls of the cold room, hollow. My response spills out before I even register it: “They’re doing well,” I reply, slipping back into the monotony of slicing, ripping, tossing; slice, rip, toss. 

The motions of the job blur together—mechanical, endless. Twelve hours bleed away into a dinner of meatloaf that tastes like sawdust, followed by a glass of wine that does nothing to dull the edge. The Buccaneers play the 49ers on TV, but I can’t focus. My children’s laughter echoes through the house, distant and eerie, as if they’re playing a game I’m no longer part of. I fall into bed, hoping for sleep to take me. It doesn’t.

The next day, everything is... wrong. The air feels heavy, suffocating, pressing down on me. Bill Withers croons again, but his voice warps—melancholic, distorted. My wife’s greeting, “Good morning, honey, how’d you sleep?” feels rehearsed, her eyes glassy, lifeless. The children’s voices are grating, sharp, like nails dragged across metal. I can’t remember their names.

Outside, the air bites colder, my breath hanging in the stillness. My car sputters to life, but the black Toyota Camry follows too closely, its headlights piercing through the fog, the honk blaring like a predator stalking its prey. I park in front of the butcher shop, but the lab’s barking is more frantic, almost desperate. Something is wrong—deeply wrong.

Inside, the smell of blood overwhelms me. I’ve grown used to it, but today it’s thick, cloying, filling my lungs. The floor is slick, the blood pooling unnaturally at my feet. Hunter greets me again—same words, same dead eyes—but his voice has a strange echo, like it’s coming from far away, from somewhere deep beneath the surface.

Slice. Rip. Toss. The day drags on, each movement slower, heavier. At noon, the lunch bell snaps me out of my daze. I look up, and the pigs on the hooks stare back. Their eyes are wide, unblinking, filled with something that looks too much like awareness. A pool of blood forms beneath them, but it’s moving—slithering, creeping toward me. I freeze as it forms a shadow at my feet, the dark liquid swirling unnaturally, defying gravity.

Then the drop. It hangs suspended, mid-air, shimmering, pulsing like a heartbeat. My breath catches. The silence is deafening—no sounds, no movement, just me and that single drop of blood. Slowly, it expands, dark tendrils reaching out, encasing it in a cocoon of shadow. From within the pulsating darkness, something stirs.

A man emerges—clad in a black leather jacket, hair slicked back, eyes hollow and black like bottomless pits with a face that seems out of focus. His presence is wrong, a blight on reality, a nightmare dragged into the waking world.

“Aren’t you bored yet?” His voice cuts through the silence, each word dripping with disdain, as if mocking the very fabric of my existence.

I don’t respond. I can’t.

“You’ve noticed, haven’t you?” He steps closer, his eyes boring into mine, seeing through me. “You’ve been living this lie for years. You died, and this... this is your punishment. A life of repetition. A loop of nothingness.” His voice warps as he speaks, distorting like a broken record. “You’ve been dead for longer than you know.”

I reel, the truth clawing at me. He smiles, but it’s a smile without warmth, a predator's grin. “You wasted your life—played it safe, stayed in the shadows, never did a damn thing with your time. And now? Now you’re stuck.”

I try to speak, but no words come out.

“But I’m feeling generous today,” he continues, his voice shifting, playful now. “I’m giving you a choice. You can go back—relive your life from the age of eighteen. You’ll have ten years to change things. Make something of yourself. If you succeed, you live. If you fail, you’ll come back here... or worse.”

His grin widens, eyes gleaming with malice. “Or, you can stay. Stay in this loop. Forever.”

The air grows colder as his words sink in. I feel the weight of my failures, my regrets. My heart pounds, my mind racing. There’s no escape, no easy answer.

I look at him, his face a twisted reflection of everything I despise about myself, and hesitantly, I extend my hand, heart pounding, ready to reclaim the life I thought I lost.

Do I reply? ,"Im recently engaged and very happy. I posted pictures on social media announcing my engagement. My ex from over 9 years ago sent me a bit of a nasty message after seeing the announcement. I ignored it because I knew he will rope me into a back and forth of me trying to defend myself against the horrible things he's saying about me. After seeing I read and ignored he sent another message apologizing.
A bit of background, I dated him on and off from when I was 18-20 years old and he was 24-26. I broke it off 3 times for various reason which he always conveniently forgot, first was because he dry humped my bum while he was naked and I was sleeping. Second was because he lied and told me he was going to his step mother's baby shower when he was actually planning to meet with another woman, who he had slept with in the past, for a coffee catch up. And the last time was because he hit me on the shoulder after I confronted him about lying about smoking weed (I know it seems silly but I didn't like it at the time). Throughout the relationship he would lie about the most minor things and I could never trust him. 
After all that I stayed friends with him and we would regularly chat. He went on to date other women but still stayed in contact with me, which I appreciated during that time because I was going through major depression and he felt like my only friend. He would message me when things weren't going well with his current partner. I stayed single for 6 years and slowly we stopped speaking as much. I found my current partner and I've been with him for 3 and a half years now. When this ex first found out he messaged asking for details on how we met etc. I didn't want to give the details because I knew he would use it against me somehow and I wasn't in the mood for an argument with him. I still have a bit of anemousity towards him but at the same time I do feel sorry for him and feel like I need to consider his feelings. I feel like he can be such an asshole but then can be so nice. I just don't know what to reply to these messages. Would I be a asshole for just ignoring knowing he's not in a good space.

His first message 
I really wish I didn't keep friends with you. It didn't help me one bit all those times I called and was a friend for you, you not like a friend made me lose the only person I loved as a best friend with your righteous he contacted me.... I did only as a friend. You judged and cut me off on my ability to be a friend after you broke up with me. Then when you got people chucked me away. Thanks to people like you I don't believe there is a best friend out there for me anymore.

(Honestly dont know who he lost as a best friend and I'm struggling a bit to understand what he's saying) 

Second message
That was stupid and unkind. I am sorry. You are a great person and deserve what you have truly. I know it's a twinkle compared to what you have but thank you for your friendship for a time. I was jealous of your secret sauce best friend for life nothing romantic at all. Truly congrats was a pleasant shock to see. The greatest irony when we met you said you didn't believe in love and I was tried to change your mind.. Now I know it's out there but not for me I don't think. I'm not the man when we met definitely but I do respect you. I won't message again.",1,1729624658.0,Advice,3,0.67,False

A lot of it boils down low effort or unrealistic expectations on ladies part really. OLD is low effort dating by definition.

If a guy is really smooth talking, you aren't his first one and there's a reason why him and some other lady haven't gotten married. If a guy promises the world, he's not gonna deliver. Got a fancy car and flashy goods, he's wasting his money trying to impress people. 

Not saying all guys that are most visible are messed up, it's just more likely that the messed up ones make a lot of effort to look really good. Think about it, how likely is it for the narcissist to be the quiet guy reading a book in the coffee shop? 

My advice is to put work into dating on the front end, make efforts to be visible and talk to guys and save your time and emotions by not having to deal with D-bags on the back end. ",0,1729624528.0,dating,3,0.5,False

...Who am I to disobey the demands of the Coven??

Content follows, unmodified from the original post.

_____

Foreword: I'm barely sure why I feel compelled to share all this, and it might just be completely ridiculous or unremarkable for all I know, but it feels like it might be valuable enough to bother to try. Plus, as it turns out... ""Extra strength"" coffee *is*; so let's do it. 

Introspection is often 'inadvertently extensive' and I have a lot of steam to let off here, so I'll try to start with the important part.

**TL;DR / Intro** - I, a notably masculine and/or physiologically imposing man, recently purchased a cute black t-shirt that says ""Childless Cat Lady"" in bold white text alongside a fashionably adorable graphic of a black cat decked out in stereotypically witchy adornments. It seemed like an awesome idea for many reasons, but the act of wearing it rapidly seemed to become far more impactful to strangers than I expected. I was proud of what it said, then heartbroken that it even *could* say as much as it did.

And real quick: If this is as far as the reader gets, I'd at least like to encourage Da Boyz to consider doing something similar. You may as well show your support on account of the fact that a childless man is going to have a hard time *remaining* childless if his formerly-childfree lady isn't allowed to be. 

More importantly... They're coming for us next, boys, I guarantee it. These kind of people do *not* stop pushing it until society is more ash than rubble. This is very much a ""first they came for the Jews"" moment in US history.

__

Considering all the shit going on today, to say *the least*, I felt it was important to demonstrate openly that I, and theoretically other men too, are capable of acknowledging and understanding that women - more than half of our species - are actively under attack as of late. A politician says, ""Childless cat ladies are ruining the country!"" It's absurd. It's sickening. It's *entirely* nonsensical in so many ways, and yet certain people were shockingly receptive to the message. 

I hoped to do more than ""just"" cheer from the sidelines, I wanted to be an example. ...Or at least a walking billboard that advertises 'giving a fuck', if nothing else.

The kind of people that'd physically confront women over their personal agency often act bravely, confident in their own ""righteousness"" because women are viewed as unlikely to present a significant threat of physical/social retaliation. *My* initial idea, simply enough, was to go ahead and slap the 'childless cat lady' label on myself - an imposing and very obviously potentially dangerous man - as if to say: ""Hey, it's me, a childless cat lady, wink-wink, so if you've got something to say, I'm right here, bud...""

I figured it'd be quite unlikely for somebody to make any rude comments to a stranger when I'm standing behind them in line at the grocery store. They'd know I wouldn't stand for it and may even be seeking to ""actively dissuade"" such behaviors flat-out. After all, the only thing worse than knowing a stranger won't approve of your actions is knowing he may *also* be looking ""adjust your outlook"" if you try. I've always tried to live my life as a quiet beacon of safety for those in need when/if they need it, and in this case I wanted to be recognizable as such *before* they need it - or to insure they won't need it.

I started getting comments mere minutes after leaving the house to knock out some quick errands downtown, literally fifteen feet from my building's doorway. 

Women of all sorts, ranging from teenagers with glorious winged eyeliner to stereotypically grandmotherly ladies hobbling their way down the frozen food section, were taking the time to compliment the shirt here or there, or announcing that they're also 'cat ladies' while waiting for the crosswalk, or just smiling as they took the time to read it as I walked by.

Not a constant stream or anything, this isn't one of those ""then I found twenty dollars and everyone clapped"" kind of stories, but easily dozens of notable reactions of *some* sort in the span of two or three errands. I like to joke that I'm 'kind of autistic but not' and it still stood out to me.

This felt great, at first. It was 'working'. It was making an impact. It was making a point. At very worst, some merely enjoyed the irony of the message. But as time went on, I rapidly started to get the feeling that many of these women may have genuinely never seen a 'manly man' (or any man at all) openly stating whose side he's *really* on. Honestly, I almost felt like some sort of exotic animal or some shit. Not an oddity, no, not a three-eyed toad found on the side of the road. Something special, the kind of thing you tell a friend about later; a spirit bear, a unicorn.

And I think that's because the message goes deeper than it seems - they might even recognize that intuitively in a way I had to grasp manually. I'm not just declaring that I'm on their team, I'm saying something closer to... ""If you have been made a target because of your gender, I have made myself a target *despite* mine."" 


Shortly after I made that leap, every once in a while I'd notice a subtle change in a stranger's posture too, just a quiet sense of relief or safety glimpsed shortly after I turned the aisle of a hardware store or whatever. 

I realized very quickly that they might've been just... Subconsciously recognizing that I probably wasn't going to be ""a problem"". I probably wasn't going to try to hit on them, or ask for their number, or brush uncomfortably close as I passed by, or any number of other tragically ""unremarkable"" things. Perhaps they even felt like nobody else was going to get away with such acts while I was nearby either. For all I know, that kind of store might've been viewed as a place where women don't belong, a ""man's realm"", and who could blame her? I, myself, noticed plenty of MAGAfied-looking fellows waddling around in search of caulk guns and PVC glue or whatever.

It's hard to describe what I'm talking about here, I fear. It's an extremely minor thing, a miniscule alteration of demeanor or even just ""vibe"", but it stood out to me. I think it'd stand out to anyone. It's the kind of interaction that only rises to the forefront of your mind hours later, fifteen minutes into an unintentionally long shower - and it was happening multiple times a week, so I found myself burning through quite a bit of water.

Where I was first excited or even proud to show my support in such an openly passive way, the whole thing started to feel heart-wrenching. It's just a shirt, I thought to myself. It shouldn't be making a noticeable impact on strangers. A piece of cheaply-printed text on a piece of equally cheap cloth shouldn't make me feel like I'm improving someone's day - let alone ensuring their safety or comfort - just by the act of wearing it *at all*.

It's just a shirt. It shouldn't be capable of sending a message like that. It shouldn't *have* to be. And while I'm more than happy, even ecstatic to show my support in such an unexpectedly vivid way, I do *not* want to live in a world where that's even an important thing to do. There shouldn't be anything special about that, nor about the fact that a person like me choose to wear it. 

But there is something remarkable about that. *Very* apparently, there is.

I've been well-aware of this kind of garbage for years, everything from casual workplace misogyny to problematic gender role nonsense, but it's the act of simply wearing this cute little shirt while walking around downtown (in a notably progressive city, no less) that really showed me how dire things are. A couple of weeks ago I even found myself unexpectedly tearing up about it. *None* of this is news to me by any means - I spend considerable (shockingly considerable) time online writing deeply about these problems all the time, and yet this collection of tiny little ""insignificant"" seconds-long interactions sit heavily in my mind.

It seems silly. All of this sounds absurd, I'm sure. I'm barely even sure why I'm writing all this out, but it feels important to share even if nobody wants to read through this needlessly introspective essay-rant. I'll mention it again, no doubt.

I'll keep wearing it here or there - for only another few months, ideally. I'd like for it to become an unremarkable thing, just a reminder of a weird shared sociopolitical nightmare. It's just a shirt, and what it says shouldn't be seen as a remarkable symbol. Not like that, anyway.

Hopefully it'll be ""just a shirt"" early next year. Unfortunately, I'm not sure it will be. I'm not sure it ever *was*.",60,1729624301.0,WitchesVsPatriarchy,7,0.93,False

1g9qbd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNotRight/comments/1g9qbd0/welcome_to_pine_ridge_the_wooden_bones_part_2/,Welcome to Pine Ridge: The Wooden Bones [Part 2],"Welcome to Pine Ridge, far off the map and a thirty minute drive away from anywhere real. We truly have it all, coffee shops with small town charm and enchanting views so beautiful you may never leave. 

I took a drive out to Tumwater the other day, not a place we normally go since it's a three hour drive but I had an appointment. Looking around at Tumwater makes the Ridge feel so much different. It's like you cross a line somewhere and the world feels different. Like how Tumwater doesn't have the wooden bones.

We have burn bans in the summer and the only ones allowed to violate that are the fire department themselves. It's so nice of them to fill the air with ash while we have every window open in a vain attempt to escape the heat. 

However, after the first leaf falls and summer comes to its end, you'll start to notice deep in the burn-etched forest, trees lying oddly in the grass. Laying on their sides, an almost aligned group of branches reaching up to the sky and all bending the same direction. Something about the way they do this and the way it turns white once the rain washed the black bark away always makes me think of bone. 

It's like some unknowable beast laid down for a nap and simply never got back up. Not all look that peaceful, some you can see the upturned root system of the stump and with the finer roots gone; it's almost like an open maw. Permanently burned open and screaming.

With autumn upon us, the rain has washed away any risk of a wildfire and the controlled burns have come to their end. Which is great for us since the furnace is currently broken. No AC, no heater and our local HVAC has no interest in fixing our current furnace, only on selling us a new one. It's still too hot for me to sleep at night, normally I would have the AC on low to give my room a good breeze and make it easy to sleep. With the AC broken though, my only option is having my window open at night. It was fine for the first few nights but then I woke up one night in a sweat and with the odd feeling something was close. My entire body on edge, I sat there and listened. 

Silence.
Pure and complete silence.

It was as though the wind had completely stopped. Everything had stopped; no wind, no frogs croaking in fields, nothing outside made a single noise. The longer I sat there the heavier the silence became until I heard just outside my window the sound of shuffling feet in the gravel.

All at once the spell was broken, I took off like a shot to the living room. My brother and cousin were still having coffee as the clock neared 12; they are both the type to have coffee late at night and still sleep soundly. 

“There's someone outside.”

“What?” My cousin asked while my brother quickly rushed over to the closet.

“I heard shuffling outside my window. There's someone outside.” I reiterate while my brother passed my cousin a hunting rifle. 

Hunting rifles and flash lights in hand, they went to check what I had heard only to find nothing. The gravel didn't even look disturbed and so we had to assume that it was just one of the cats from the small feral colony that lives on our property. 

I closed my window that night. I suffered the discomfort of the heat and nestled myself deep into my blankets as though they were a shield keeping the dark at bay. I didn't open my window the next night or the next. 

I found that the bathroom window was close enough that I could open it and receive some relief. I kept opening the bathroom window before laying down but on the nights I'd forget, I'd listen extra close after opening it. I could see the shape of the trees whipping in the wind but the wind was quiet.

I wasn't sleeping very well after all of that. The heat in the house was getting to me and I couldn't do it anymore. I started opening my window again. I wake up in the night a lot but after the first time, I started listening every time I woke up. Listening for just a moment to hear, often being greeted be silence but often if I listened I would hear the wind start up again. The noise would return and I would fall asleep again.

The hunting rifles are for the coyotes by the way, I know some people have opinions about guns but when you're this far out, you can't afford to be caught off guard. The coyotes don't get close to the house, but we're prepared just in case. 

You never realize how small coyotes really are until one night you see one standing in the backyard, stock still on its hind legs. I have no idea if it was staring at me because it heard me coming or if it was looking inside the house for some reason. I minded my business though, forest animals don't like to be stared at, and it lowered its head and walked off into the night. After it turned I'll admit I looked it over, I think I was a bit too tired that night though; the fur almost looked like splintered wood.

I saw the coyote in the yard shortly before I finally closed my window for good. It was the dead of night and I had been listening to junk on my phone so I didn't focus too much on the window. I finally dozed off only to wake up an hour later to stagnant air filling every corner of my room. 

“Must have forgot to open it tonight.” I told myself as I pulled my sweaty body out of bed and checked the window. 

I usually like to check the window without opening the curtains, the way I do this is simply by reach through the curtain to feel for the mesh screen or glass. I reached into the fabric and as my hand reached forward passing where the glass should be, I heard nothing. My hand suddenly collided with the screen for just a moment I felt something push back as something on the otherside breathed out warm, stagnant air.

A jolt ran through my body as I pull my hand back and did the only I could think to do; I slammed and locked the window. Shaking I threw myself back under my covers, fumbling to put something on to distract my shaken mind. After a few minutes rational thought started to take over.

“I'm just tired, I was probably half asleep. There's nothing out there.” I repeated in my mind until sleep over took me. When I woke up, we found no evidence of anything outside my window again but I put a wooden rod in the tracks of my window just feel a bit more at ease about the whole thing. The next night we could hear the coyotes outside again, they were very active, howling the night away.

The fire department did an out of season controlled burn after that, and driving by on my way to Tumwater, I couldn't help but notice the roaring, open maws of the root systems. 

We did manage to find the burnt out fuse in the furnace and have ordered the part to fix the furnace, which is just in time since winter without a heater would be difficult.
Either way, if you decide to visit us you might just want to stay the night and if you do, I recommend closing your windows if the night air is too warm. Welcome to Pine Ridge, home to any number of majestic animals, from elk to black tail dear, and if you see anything strange. No, you didn't.

Sometimes I buy way too many beans because I'm afraid of missing something running out. I currently have 4 bags of Brandywine and 4 bags of Black & White. I assumed that putting my beans in air tight vacuum bags would help them to last. I bought a bunch of reusable zip lock FoodSaver bags. I found a great hack, using a wine saver pump worked with the FoodSaver bags. But I have a high failure rate on these bags - they let air in sometimes after an hour or a day. So it hit me last week - buy some glass bottles, pour my beans in those, use wine stops and my wine saver pump and viola, air tight bean storage. 

But now I'm wondering is storing beans in a vacuum the best way to make them last. I need my beans to stay fresh  for 2 months. What's the science say? Air tight? I know I see lots of comments saying ""leave them in the bag the roaster shipped them in"" but I want them to be as fresh as possible for a couple of months. Most roasters say beans last 3-4 weeks after you open their bags. 

Not necessarily looking for a ""new way"" - just whether there's science out there saying airtight storage makes the beans last.

I'll put some of the places we've been thinking about below but we're open to suggestions! We love food, nature, wine, coffee, walking, etc!

I am an early riser and was looking forward to morning coffee on the verandah. How can I make myself an oat milk latte onboard? Is there a hack? I was thinking of bringing a couple of oat milk cartons and an ‘aerolatte’ frother. Can I order the espresso from room service?

You ever felt the raw power of drinking 8 cups of coffee by 0600, just to be told to “stand by” for 6 hours? That’s called discipline, kid. I once PT’d so hard that my legs filed for divorce, but guess what? Marines don’t quit, and neither do my knees (even though they’re begging for early retirement).

I’m fueled by adrenaline, energy drinks, and the mysterious green stuff they serve in the chow hall. It’s called “food” but nobody’s sure what it really is. Some say it’s where lost motivation goes to die. But I eat it anyway because, guess what, I’m a Marine, and Marines eat crayons for fun. Red’s my favorite, in case you’re wondering—pairs nicely with that tactical MRE gum.

You think boot camp is hard? Try standing at attention for hours while some lieutenant explains how we’re “doing great things” that totally don’t involve mopping the same floor 12 times before chow. But that’s the price of freedom, baby. Oorah.

Being a Marine isn’t a job—it’s a lifestyle. A lifestyle that involves living in barracks designed by someone who thought a cardboard box was luxury housing. But it’s all good because I got my squad, my stack of MREs, and my unshakable sense of pride… and maybe just a touch of PTSD from cleaning my rifle for the 47th time this week.

So, yeah. You civilians think you got it tough? Try thriving on a diet of midnight missions, hurry-up-and-wait, and a burning desire to be in formation 30 minutes early. We’re not just built different, we’re built Marine. Semper Fi and pass the crayons.",14,1729623994.0,USMC,11,0.82,False

Little did I know the origins of both extend back to 1999! Decided to post this with the return of SMC today and ICC next month.

This is my amateur attempt to assemble the history of how **Talk Cinema** eventually morphed into **Reel Talk** to **Secret Movie Club** and **International Cinema Cafe**. Most importantly, I have gathered as much as possible about the films shown over the years, although a few gaps are missing. I welcome any info on these if you can direct me to a credible source. Much of this comes from an amalgamation of links from the Wayback Machine, old websites, tweets, Letterboxd posts, Reddit comments/posts and my best judgment. I will try to provide proof if asked. If I have any info that you think is wrong, please let me know.

**Sorry if the Wayback Machine links are not working. The Internet Archive just went down again when I decided to post this.**

**TALK CINEMA - THE BEGINNING**
> Talk Cinema, Inc., co-founded in 1992 by Harlan and Susan Jacobson, is the [United States] nation’s most inclusive and longest-running sneak preview and discussion program.  Talk Cinema’s audiences get to be among the first to see a new movie and discuss with special guests – seeing films the way critics and industry insiders do at film festivals.

[Talk Cinema's website page on Sneak Previews](https://www.talkcinema.com/sneak-previews)

After 1992, Talk Cinema would be expanded to several locations like Boston, Chicago, Denver, and Seattle. By 1999, Toronto would be added to the list. The screenings would take place on Sunday mornings at the Cineplex Odeon's York Cinema (Yonge and Eglinton. Now demolished) initially before taking place at Cineplex Odeon Varsity Cinemas (Manulife Centre @ Bay/Bloor). Food would also be served before each screening.

Fun fact, the TIFF box office used to be at the Manulife Centre. They were also called TIFFg back then, the ""g"" standing for group.

> Talk Cinema (now Reel Talk), Sunday morning preview & discussion series, begins

Before the start of the 2002/2003 season, the series was successful enough ([according to TIFF's 2002 annual report](https://web.archive.org/web/20101202132143/http://tiff.net/pdfs/TIFF2002AnnualReport.pdf)) to warrant an expansion to another location. This would be Cineplex Odeon Sheppard Centre Grande Cinemas (Yonge/Sheppard). There are rarely any overlaps with films here as both locations try to screen different films. When you purchase a subscription, you would have to specify the venue.

**REEL TALK - THE REBRAND**  
Talk Cinema renamed itself to Reel Talk before the 2005/2006 season, based on its first mention in [TIFF's annual report for 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20101202131617/http://tiff.net/pdfs/TIFF2005AnnualReport.pdf). It even had its own website. I am assuming that one or both of the parties decided to part ways and TIFF continued the series under their name. Locations for the screenings remained the same.

**SNEAK PREVIEW AND WORLD CINEMA - THE MOVE AND SPLIT**  
With the opening of the TIFF Lightbox in 2010, all screenings of Reel Talk would officially be hosted there, with one final year of screenings at the Cineplex Odeon Sheppard Centre. Another big change would be the split into two streams:

* **Reel Talk: Sneak Preview** – previews on soon-to-be-released titles, with a focus on English-language independent cinema.

* **Reel Talk: Contemporary World Cinema** – provides a global “snapshot” of the best in cinema from around the world, with a focus on non-English language, art house films that are unlikely to be widely released.

Sounds pretty familiar, right?

According to [TIFF's annual 2010 report](https://web.archive.org/web/20120507165632/http://tiff.net/pdfs/2010%20Annual%20Report.pdf), this was based on user feedback. You can choose between the two streams or subscribe to both if you wish. For the final year at Cineplex Odeon Sheppard Centre, the subscription (called Reel Talk: Uptown) you get for this venue would be a mix of both Sneak Preview and Contemporary World Cinema. Info on Reel Talk looks to have moved to the new TIFF.net website.

One change I noticed was that starting with the 2012/2013 season, the Contemporary World Cinema (CWC) stream expanded to two showtimes because of popularity ([Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20120922095045/http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiffbelllightbox/2012/4600001612)). You can buy a subscription for 10 am or 10:30 am. This would continue to be offered up until 2020/2021 (for obvious reasons). Sneak Preview would remain with one showtime in the morning.
 
**Unsure about one of the films for Sneak Preview, but I have a strong suspicion it is Grabbers (2012) by Jon Wright because of this [Letterboxd user's list](https://boxd.it/1jK2g) that matches up well with the rest of the films mentioned here and I couldn't find anywhere else.

**SECRET MOVIE CLUB AND REEL TALK - THE CHANGES AND PIVOT**  
[The press release for the Summer 2018](https://assets.ctfassets.net/22n7d68fswlw/49wdpLYTvOW406wwSw0Iok/fc6fbc80ae03d61aee2e908856fac306/TBLB_SUMMER_2018_-_Seasonal_Press_Release.pdf) programming mentions the name change from Reel Talk: Sneak Preview to Secret Movie Club (SMC) and offers subscribers assigned seating for the first time. Contemporary World Cinema will keep moving along fine UNTIL...

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2019/2020 season with the remaining screenings for March and April would be cancelled.

For the 2020/2021 season, both SMC AND CWC were made digital only for the first time, therefore making both series available across Canada. When you purchased a ticket or subscription, the films were available from Friday to Sunday. Q&As were live on Sundays and available after.

The 2021/2022 season had both series return to a mostly in-person format with two digital screenings for the January titles. CWC also got rid of the second showtime.

The 2022/2023 season brought big changes for both series. For SMC, they have shifted from Sunday mornings to Tuesday evenings. For Reel Talk (that's right, they dropped Contemporary World Cinema from the title. Just Reel Talk), it would be a hybrid series with a choice between a subscription for in-person screenings on Sunday mornings or digital-only available on Wednesday evenings.

**FINAL NOTES**  
Thanks for sticking around for my crazy-ass post. Some random things I want to mention:  

   * For a mostly complete list from 1999-2010, [here is a link to a tiff.net page from the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20110910051509/http://tiff.net:80/reeltalk/previousfilms). It did make an error when they listed Invictus twice though for the 2009/2010 season.  

   * Some fun facts from the 2002 annual report: 3,400 attendees
in 2002, 13 events in the 2002/2003 season, 24 guests, 8,232 muffins/croissants/danishes served and 9,673 cups of coffee/tea/hot chocolate served.  

   * One benefit you get from subscribing back in the day was exclusive access to a subscriber's only forum on the old websites. This seems to have stopped in 2010 when Reel Talk moved to the Lightbox.  
[Wayback Machine - Sept 2001 Forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20010917043936/http://www.e.bell.ca/filmfest/tc/reviews.asp)

[Wayback Machine - Reeltalk.ca. Check the right.](https://web.archive.org/web/20100625143552/http://reeltalk.ca/default.aspx)

   * But what about the guests? Yeah, that info was pretty scattershot to find. Earlier annual reports from TIFF mention them but became harder to find later on. Can provide some details for some years between 2002-2010 and 2018-2021 (SMC only).  

   * If you wanna know the hosts, I got info on that from 2010 to now.

   * How about those price changes? That was also fun to chart. For context, [here is an order form for the 2000/2001 season](https://web.archive.org/web/20001018014338/http://www.e.bell.ca/filmfest/tc/order.pdf) I believe. For one subscription (six films) it was $107 each (including GST). Single tickets were $21.40 (including GST). I might make a separate comment on prices.

   * Do you have this on a spreadsheet? YES. GOOGLE SHEETS. Can I see it? NO. Sorry, but it is connected to my personal Gmail. I will be open to providing my sources.

   * Will you do more of these? MAYBE. The big one would be to source the entire history of TIFF Cinematheque which goes back to 1990. I did start but I am not sure if would even be a post. Maybe just a fun project for me. I've got other series in mind that were cancelled and hopefully shorter to complete like the Books on Film series and its spinoffs.

1g9q3nr,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1g9q3nr/help/,Help!,"Help me choose a new coffee machine under 6k

Hey everyone, I’m a total beginner when it comes to coffee but I love good coffee and appreciate a decent cup.

I have a habit of making coffee as soon as I wake up. I previously bought the Agaro coffee machine from Amazon (one of the cheaper ones) along with different Blue Tokai coffee grounds.

However, my maid broke the glass jug, and I can’t seem to find a replacement for it. So, I’m thinking of upgrading to a new coffee machine, preferably under 5k, but I can stretch to 6k if needed.

Since I’m usually pretty lazy in the mornings, I need something super simple that I can set up with just water and coffee, and let it do its thing while I get ready.

I’ve also switched to Lavazza coffee grounds, which I prefer over Blue Tokai and Sleepy Owl.

Any recommendations? Thanks!

1g9pwjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dalhousie/comments/1g9pwjr/just_gotta_vent/,Just gotta vent,"This post originally started as a comment reply where I was trying to offer some encouragement to a student that had recently failed a midterm, and it ballooned in to a much larger reflection on my time at Dalhousie. Studying (and working) at Dalhousie was a huge chapter of my life. If you're from Halifax and went to Dal maybe you'll relate, maybe you won't.

I come from a family where one side are very academic, there are more engineers, scientists, doctors and professors than you can count on both hands and feet. Conversely, the other side of my family is a lot smaller, far less educated, less affluent, and much more dysfunctional. When I think about education, that comparison usually comes to mind. Towards the end of high school it felt like pretty much everyone in my life was pushing me towards university (family, teachers, mentors, friends), and I think that was because on paper, I was a model freshman university student. 

The problem I felt was that I didn't really know what I wanted to do with myself. I felt some desire to become a photographer in my youth but any time I expressed that I found people were generally discouraging. I always struggled with the question 'what do you want to be when you grow up'. I thought I wanted to take some time between high school and university to try and figure that out, but everyone told me that would be a bad idea for a host of reasons I no longer believe, but I took to heart at the time. 'You'll figure it out at university' was a common refrain.

Sitting on the fence about what I wanted to do, I decided at the very least to stay in HRM. I saw financial and personal merits to staying here even if I had other options. Choice paralysis maybe. I was enrolled as a student at both Dalhousie and SMU for a short period of time at the start of my first semester. Fairly quickly, I settled on Dalhousie. I was still financially dependant on my parents to pay part of my tuition and provide me with a place to live. I was appreciative of the support, but I also felt like I was missing out on campus life. At first, I had a bit of a social life around Dal, but it was mostly with people I went to high school with. Underage and unable to get in to bars, we went to parties, had our first experiences with alcohol. We sat in on film lectures and went to movie screenings. We smoked pot and cigarettes for the first time. I had my first sexual experiences in a King's College dorm. I had some fun outside of class, but I still worked very hard in my first year. Campus could be overstimulating to me at times, but it was still exciting and new and I still had the attitude that if I put my mind to it, I could achieve anything. I worked the same retail job I had in high school during most of first year at Dal. I maintained my entrance scholarship and I was awarded a fairly substantial scholarship towards the end of my first year (enough to cover most of my tuition for second year) to my surprise. I think I was on the Dean's list for my first semester. 

I spent a lot of time commuting by bus to be on campus, listening mostly to late 00's indie-rock on my iPod while trying to read textbooks. Getting to campus, my first priority was usually finding a coffee. I often feel like I missed out on campus life by virtue by not living closer to the heart of it, it limited my chances at engaging in more spontaneous activities. I often felt jealous of people who lived in residence. No one in my graduating high school class pursued the same program as me, and towards the end of my first year I was seeing my friends around campus less and less. I made a few new friends, but those friendships never really persisted. A close friend of mine who had taken a gap year after high school got accepted to Concordia and left for Montreal. A few acquaintances dropped out and moved back to their home towns. People went travelling. I didn't feel any surer about my choice of studying at Dal. I increasingly began to feel like I could simply disappear from Dal and nobody would notice my absence, and I struggled to make personal connections with my professors and teaching assistants, and to a lesser degree with my classmates.

I went from having a flip-phone to a BlackBerry to an early Android phone around this time. People still seemed amazed at all the things a smartphone could do, whether that was a video call or pouring a fake glass of beer. Learn to program, you can get rich selling a $.99 app. Get a CS degree and you won't struggle to get a job was what it felt like the world was saying. My relationship with computing started to get more complex around this time. On one hand, I was more and more digitally connected, with an increasingly large network of friends on Facebook. On the other hand, I was starting to feel the effects of being chronically attached to a computer. Streaming sites like Netflix became popular, Youtube went from being a website with short videos to longer form content. I was more and more using my laptop for everything, whether it was for work or pleasure. It became harder to concentrate on programming and looking at IDE when a quick dopamine hit was always one browser tab away. My elective coursework provided a form of catharsis, I could vent my frustrations and opinions about the world in my political science papers. I felt discontent by the fact I didn't have adequate knowledge of CS to have my own well-formed opinions, even though it was my major. It felt as dense and impenetrable as the expensive textbooks I was buying. I slid in to the Dunning-Kruger valley, the more I learned, the more I was acutely aware of how little I actually knew about my major.

By the end of my first year I got tired of spending my weekends stacking lawn chairs and patio furniture, and I left my retail job to work in the technology department at a department/office supply store. Floor sales were tracked on a whiteboard and there were sales targets even though we weren't paid commission. I wasn't particularly great at selling 'attachments' (extend warranties, high profit items, etc.) and was given that reason when I was fired at the end of my probation period. I told the people around me I quit so I could focus on my studies. My parents moved away from Halifax around then. I feel lonely than ever, and feel the need to seek out new and totally different experiences, including working at a summer job at a camp for people with disabilities. This makes me seriously question whether I wanted to pursue a degree like nursing or special needs education, but I decide I would probably get burnt out by it in the long-term.

At this point I really start to flounder. I've left my class registration for second year late and courses are filling up and I have more limited options. I end up with a poor course selection for the first semester of my second year. I think a lot about changing my major. I've almost totally abstained from technology while working at a summer camp. I get back to Halifax and feel more disconnected from my friends than ever before. One of my friends who moved away likes to play multiplayer Xbox games a lot, and I buy an Xbox 360 as a birthday gift to myself and we start playing online and chatting more together. That was the first time I really struggled with video games taking a hold over me. I got sucked in to the gameplay loop of multiplayer FPS games. I get lost in the universe of Bethesda and Rockstar's singleplayer games. 

I started dodging commitments and fell behind on coursework. By the time midterms came around in the first semester of my second year, I was totally unprepared. I tried talking to a therapist for the first time, but I had a hard time opening up about my issues with them and didn't make much progress. I felt I couldn't talk to friends and family because I was worried about letting them down and I felt ashamed of myself. I had a short unfocused meeting with an academic advisor, and it felt like the only actionable advice they gave me was the notion that if I felt I couldn't handle the stress of university the best option was to drop out. I have an identity crisis. A few months pass and the semester hasn't gone well. I fail classes and I'm put on academic probation. In hindsight, I could have recovered and pulled myself out of that slump if I had the right help. My outlook on nearly everything became negative. I withdrew both from school and from other things in my life. I didn't tell anyone that I'd dropped out until months later. I became bitter and jaded. 

Flash forward a few years of waiting tables and feeling intellectually unfulfilled. Those years become a blur. Eventually I get the notion I should try and further my education again. I get in to community college and take a introductory programming class, and I get a 99%. I work in the trades for a while. I still feel unfulfilled. Work stops at my company for a while, and I start teaching myself JavaScript to fill the time. I finally start to get a grasp on higher-level programming concepts. I program games and writing code finally feels fun for the first time. I re-apply to Dalhousie and admissions lets me back in. My second time had many new challenges, and some of the same challenges from the first time around. I made some of the same mistakes again. Maybe I will document that experience sometime. What ultimately pulled me through was adopting a mentality that put the primacy of getting that parchment above all else. It matured me in some ways, and arrested me in others. I had to make a lot of personal and financial sacrifices to make that happen. My love/hate relationship with computers still remains, and I will always have to manage that. Sometimes, you have to take a few steps backwards in order to move forward again. 

TL;DR: I finally got my degree, in spite of myself.",7,1729623251.0,Dalhousie,2,0.77,False

It's okay for him to keep the alcohol at a level were people aren't noticeably different. But it feels *really* undesirable not to drink at all. Weed seems to be less of a must-have for social gatherings, but it's certainly nice to have.

My preferred way of socialising is being with 1-2 other people who are currently completely sober. I never use any mind-altering substances at all, not even coffee or psychiatric drugs. The last two and nicotine don't bother me much with other people. But anything else makes me want to leave or not even go at all. My issues don't just begin when the drug changes someone but already for the fact that they're using something. I also have less of an interest to get to know people when I know recreational or illicit drugs are meaningful to them. It's just a very strong dislike. Hardcore black-and-white thinking maybe?

I recently talked to other autistic people and was surprised to learn that most of the group both abstain from drug use and dislike being around people who use, too. It was very validating to know that is not just a *me* issue.

But still it's causing issues in our relationship because he would love for me to join in more. Not in using drugs, but in going to events where he and/or other people consume. So far I've always said no and feel reluctant to change that. I'm also newly diagnosed so this is a time where I need to honestly evaluate where I can and want to spend my energy.

But yeah, we're both willing to work together, look deep inside ourselves for areas of compromise and find an agreement that works for each of us. But I'm still having a hard time seeing how this could look like.

Does anybody have similar issues in their relationships? How do you navigate them?

We hired a nanny a month ago that comes twice a week to watch our 8 month old baby. She's an older career nanny and came highly recommended, has been doing this for decades. We also have prior experience with another nanny for our older child. 

Our nanny helps around the house (washes bottles, unloads dishwasher, does baby laundry, wipe down of kitchen counter) and is very sweet with the baby. However, I feel she doesn't seem to grasp the concept of wake windows and a schedule. For example, our schedule has been the same for the past few weeks for naps (2 naps a day, 3 hours wake window before nap 1 and between nap 1 and 2, no single nap should be longer than 2 hours) and for bottles (1 bottle breastmilk before a nap, 1 bottle after a nap). We have written this all down and have gone over the schedule multiple times with her. That said, she still doesn't seem to grasp the concept of wake windows and never puts baby to bed on time or just needs us to help her with the basic calculation. For example, baby wakes up at 11am and next nap would be at 2pm, but she thinks itll be at 1pm. We have the schedule, which hasn't changed, written on a piece of paper on the countertop. 

Today, I decided to step outside the house while she was here. WHen I came back, baby was down for nap but nanny said baby was super fussy, inconsolable, kept putting fingers in mouth etc. She assumed this meant baby was sleepy, so she put baby down a little early. anyways, it turns out she forgot to give him his bottle before nap. He did not have any milk for more than 3 hours, and he usually gets milk every 2-3 hours (breastmilk baby).  I tried not to show how upset I was, and once again directed her to the paper with the schedule that we've placed on the countertop every time she's here, and told her to please review it again. Sure enough, baby woke up after 45 minutes of napping (baby usually naps 2 hours) because they were so hungry and had not received milk in over 4 hours.

  
We occasionally WFH but I feel that with her inability to understand the schedule, I end up micromanaging her and constantly checking in to make sure she knows the correct nap time, etc. I also don't feel I can go work from a coffee shop or another place because these misses keep happening. Am I being unreasonable? Is knowing how to keep a schedule an unrealistic expectation to have of a seasoned nanny?",2,1729623214.0,NannyEmployers,14,0.75,False

Hii
So I have a crush on this girl, we know each other but never had a real conversation, only some small talk here and there, she tried to start a conversation but I always dodged it because I used to be really socially anxious.

Saturday we had a concert, she sang and played the piano and I played the drums…
After the concert was over I dmd her on instagram and told her she was really good, she answered with ‘ thank youu dear you too ;)’ and I responded with this emoji 😘 ( I love using emojis and send this emoji to anyone) 
Now I’d like to ask her out but I don’t know if it’s okay or I should talk to her a little more. 
I won’t see her face to face until June and can reach her only in instagram, so that’s why I want to ask her out already…

I caught her stealing g glances at me multiple times and when we see each other she always compliments me 
What should I do? 
(By asking her out I mean casually asking her to get coffee)

Should I ask her out or just talk to her more ??
How should I start a conversation on instagram?

1g9pni6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pheromones/comments/1g9pni6/pheromones_what_they_are_how_they_work_and_more/,"Pheromones – What They Are, How They Work and More","# What exactly are pheromones?

Pheromones are chemical signals that organisms, including us humans, release into their environment. They’re invisible little messengers that spark a reaction in others of the same species. Whether it's to attract a mate, mark territory, or even signal danger, these compounds are doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work that you don’t even realize.

In animals, pheromones are incredibly powerful and precise. Think of how ants march in perfect lines or how some animals ""mark"" their space. These are all pheromone-driven behaviors.

# Do Humans Even Have Functional Pheromones?

Unlike many animals, humans don’t rely on pheromones for communication as blatantly as other species do, but pheromones still influence human behavior – just more subtly.

Here are some of the key players when it comes to human pheromones:

* Androstenone (alpha vibes, dominance, sexual attraction)
* Alpha Androstenol (social butterfly, friendlier aura)
* Androstadienone (comfort and bonding, emotional warmth)

But here's the thing: our vomeronasal organ (VNO), the structure that helps many animals detect pheromones, **is** considered nonfunctional in us humans. So how are we picking up on these signals?

# Vertebrates, Pheromones, and the Olfactory System

Many animals detect pheromones using their VNO, but vertebrates (including us) have evolved to have two olfactory systems:

1. Main olfactory system – the one responsible for your sense of smell.
2. Accessory olfactory system (VNO) – primarily for pheromone detection in some species, but inactive or less functional in others, like humans.

While the human VNO is a controversial topic and thought by many researchers to be a vestigial organ, studies suggest we might be detecting pheromones through our regular olfactory system, particularly through the main olfactory epithelium **–** the same one that helps you enjoy the smell of fresh coffee or a good cologne.

# So, How Do Pheromones Work in Humans?

While it’s true our VNO might be nonfunctional, some researchers believe pheromones still affect our brains through other pathways, particularly in regions tied to mood, emotion, and attraction. When someone is exposed to a pheromone, it could stir up sexual attraction, boost confidence, or make them seem more dominant or approachable, depending on the pheromone.

Even though we may not ""smell"" pheromones in the traditional sense (though some people can still smell certain pheromones), our brains respond to them. We just don’t fully understand the mechanisms yet.

# The Decline in Hormones and What It Means for Pheromones

Let’s talk about hormone levels – testosterone, in particular. Over the past few decades, testosterone levels **in** men have been on the decline. Some studies show that men today have lower testosterone levels compared to men just 20–30 years ago.

This may be due to various factors such as more sedentary lifestyles, stress, lack of adequate sleep, poor diets and the prevalence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as BPA, pthalates and parabens. EDCs can be found in everyday items like plastics, receipts, personal care products (shampoos, lotions, perfumes), pharmaceuticals, food products, etc. They are everywhere!

Why does this matter for pheromones? Testosterone is directly linked to the production of certain pheromones, like androstenone, the powerhouse molecule associated with dominance and sexual attraction. As testosterone levels drop, so does the body's ability to produce pheromone signals. This hormonal decline might explain why some people feel that natural attraction has diminished and why pheromone products have become more popular to help restore that edge.

# But Do Pheromone Products Actually Work?

You bet!

Official researchers and most members of the public are skeptical or may even scoff at the idea of pheromones having any effect on us. Despite decades of research, scientists have struggled to find definitive proof that human pheromones work the same way as they do in animals. Human behavior is influenced by a variety of factors, and isolating the impact of pheromones in controlled studies has proven difficult. Some studies show effects, while others don't, making the science feel inconclusive​​.

However, independent researchers such as ones from the now defunct forums Pherotruth (original) and Pherotalk have experimented with pheromones for the past few decades in real-life situations with positive results. This has led to the formulation of pheromone products as we know them today.

Not all pheromone blends are effective, though. Recently there have been many new pheromone companies and products popping up all over social media, but many of these have proved to be ineffective or weak at best. Luckily there are several pheromone companies with tried-and-true products that have been used by pheromone enthusiasts for years. Still, not every product will work for everyone, so some experimenting is required.

# Why Should You Care About Pheromones?

If you're someone looking to:

* Boost your social confidence
* Create stronger emotional connections
* Increase odds of attraction
* Gain more respect and authority
* Have a little fun experimenting with the psychology of attraction

Then pheromones could be your opportunity. The best part? It’s a wide-open field of experimentation for anyone to join. Whether it’s using products like Wolf for that “trustworthy leader” vibe, or Grail of Affection (GOA) to deepen emotional connections, there’s something for everyone to try.

Because someone i liked for the whole summer finally talked to me, and we kinda started something but it's nothing serious. Which is fine, because I don't want a relationship. Therefore I can still go on dates with other guys. I'm still single.
I forgot to message back my neighbor for 2 days, and he double text me, asking me to drink coffee in the morning, or to just go out at the stairs and sit and talk. I would've done it, but if I don't respond to him for a day, he triple texts me. And I started getting the ice when I didn't reply to him for 2 days because I did get overwhelmed with work, and he found me on ig somehow, requested to follow me (i still haven't accepted) then like a day or 2 after that he messaged me if I wanna have dinner with him (I worked double that day) and by the time I saw the message it was 10pm, and I don't think it's appropriate to text people you are not close with after 9pm, at least I wouldn't like that. So, I was going to appologize the next day, tell him I worked double and I saw his message late, but that night he even found me on  tiktok and followed me there.
So I'm just done. I don't even wanna give him a chance, this is creeping me out that he is just finding me on social media and following me. He could've just asked about my social media.
I haven't replied to him.. I was wondering how to just reject him nicely.

Should I just say I met someone else? I'm seeing someone else, I am not longer interested?

Anyway it would be awkward since I'll probably see him at some point again. But I feel like he is getting obsessed with me and didn't even had a date with me. Idk just felt suffocated.",3,1729622213.0,dating,1,1.0,False

I’ve been working as grocery store manager for the past 14 years has anyone from the grocery industry have any experience on how the transition to Starbucks worked out for them? How much of a difference is there between groceries and making coffee? Also to address I would initially take a paycut but from what was mentioned from recruiter there is so much more growth opportunities at Starbucks then where I currently work at.

Looking for advice on this two day itinerary I'm working on for my wife and I who are traveling to NYC for our anniversary. We are so excited to visit your city. We know that with only two days, we won't be able to do everything. We're fine with skipping some of the main attractions, especially given that we live nearby in Chicago and will likely visit again at some point.

**Day 1 (Saturday)**

* Arrive at LGA at 11am
* Check-in at hotel (Financial District)
* \~1pm?: Walk across Brooklyn Bridge to DUMBO for Manhattan Bridge view (1.5 miles); should we consider the ferry? Walking sounds nice.
* Jane's Carousel - Wanted to visit this since seeing it in the film *Past Lives*. Let me know if not worth it
* We'd like to spend time exploring this area on foot and having a meal-- looking for recommendations here. Also open to Ubering to another area entirely
* ~~Prince Street Pizza~~ Any NY style pizza of note in the area
* Bar Pisellino for drinks-- does this place only have seating in the summer? Have heard great things and my wife loves aperol spritzes.

**Day 2**

* Breakfast/coffee near hotel. I've heard Suited and Conwell Coffee Hall are good. My wife really wants to try the pancakes at Clinton St. Baking Co. but I've heard it can be difficult to get a table.
* Uber to Bryant Park
* I mapped out a bunch of filming locations from the show Gossip Girl, which is one of my wife's favorites. It amounts to what is hopefully a scenic \~5mi walk with breaks that starts in Bryant Park, through the southern half of Central Park, and ends at the Museum of the City of New York. I'd like to bake the following stops into this walk:
   * Nintendo Store
   * MoMA
   * Times Square
   * Blue Willow for lunch (I want to try their mapo tofu!)
* By the time we get to MCNY I imagine it will be early evening- looking for suggestions as to whether we should hang out and eat in East Harlem or go somewhere else.

**Day 3 - traveling back home**

Does this all sound feasible? My feeling is that there's room in this itinerary for a few more specific things. As you can probably tell, it's the late evening/nighttime activities that I'm struggling with. Any recommendations would be great! Thank you so much. Some things to help narrow down reccomendations:

* We are not picky eaters at all and love trying the best food a place has to offer. Budget is very flexible, but not trying to ball out for every meal.
* Cozy cocktail bars/restaurants would be a nice change of pace for us since we're traveling without our kids and giant stroller
* Our main priorities are enjoying good food/drink, walks with nice scenery to take in the city, and cool shopping at a somewhat chill pace.",0,1729622156.0,AskNYC,8,0.5,False

I was soo shocked I just froze and he go up and moved away.

I (32M) am currently on a park bench having a coffee because I left my house to go for a walk, I share the house with my pwBPD (F31), because I felt things potentially escalating. What happened was: she accidentally startled me entering the house, I was wearing noise canceling headphones and listening to a podcast while focusing in the kitchen on making a snack. I scare easily due to some ADHD/PTSD and if I'm startled I always need like a minute to get back in check with myself, I can't really help my sensitivity to it but I am completely able to regulate my reaction.  However, she gets upset everytime this happens and we discussed several times how to prevent it because the layout of the house is such that I am usually with my back to the main entrance and am usually wearing headphones, I've told her there's not much I can do about that, eventually we agreed we'd just have to accept it, and it's not like it sends me into a pstd flashback either. I'm just focused, startled, more sensitive to that, and I recover within minutes. But she doesn't give me those minutes, instead she starts pushing my buttons. 
Today I tried explaining again, like if she gives me a well-meant cheeky slap on the butt, it actually startles me and it's not arousing to me at all. And that I've told her that several times as well.
She put her hands over her ears and just went ""okay stop stop stop, just stop talking"" and left the room. 
I decided to not engage further and just go outside, which is something I started doing not long after we moved in together a few months ago after being together for 2 years.

Anyway, now I'm sat here and wondering what I'm supposed to do when I inevitably have to go back home in like, 15 minutes or so, and she's probably still upset and perhaps on the verge of a split. It's such a benign issue from my POV but for her it was like ""I can't even say hello to my boyfriend in my own home the way I want to or touch him lightly to show affection"" and I just don't agree, or am I overreacting? I try to be as understanding as possible but all of these small things added up day-to-day really intensify my PTSD symptoms and I just also don't like cheeky slaps on the ass, I'm sure she thinks it's harmless but she seems indifferent to my startled reactions, unless I vocalize to her I'm not really that kind of guy and I have bad peripheral awareness because I tend to hyperfocus and it just doesn't work with me. I never blame her for it either, although she feels that way. She just thinks some things should be normal and I feel like I'm being made the problem. 

So now I'm sitting on a bench venting on reddit because I guess I'm a bit nervous to go back home. Any words of encouragement or advice appreciated. I'm aware my mental make-up in combination with a BPD partner is not necessarily ideal but please be kind, she and I are usually also understanding when it comes to eachothers' limits :) I just wanna know if there's a way to 'counter' an oncoming split. 
So far I've had limited succes.

My GF and I have been doing the long distance thing for about 8 months now. I’m based in the opposite hemisphere but she spends +- 7 months out of the year in my country and the rest of the year travelling with girl friends or spending time at home with her family. She’s got a solid group of friends in my country because she’s been here multiple times before so making friends and being a part of the ‘local-scene’ is not uncommon. 

The last time she was down I mentioned that I don’t mind you having guy friends as long as there is no 1-on-1s and she pretty much agreed that it’s a logical views. 

Today, after her being back (after 3 months away) for about a week she called and made mention of her going for a walk and a coffee with a guy friend. I’ve a spent the last week sleeping over at hers (bar last night) and all of a sudden today, this pops up. She wasn’t hiding anything so I don’t think she had a malicious intent.  

All I asked was ‘“was it just you two alone?” - I was pretty triggered but tried my best to keep my cool and not come across perturbed. 

She has mentioned before that she needs to nurture and put effort into friendships so that if we break up she doesn’t have no one at all in this country. But surely 1-on-1s can be avoided 

This is just a little confusing for me because I constantly monitor attraction levels and I’d say it’s consistently at  solid 9-10/10 from her side and I’m not worried she’s going to cheat on me at all but I also need tackle these no-nos in their tracks. 

Any advice?

Excellent condition, but do note that I took the laptop to the local coffee shop to do work. So it's not 10/10 mint.

","Hi peeps,

Hope you're all doing well!

I have a question about the machine, and having watched many videos and read as much as I could about it, I decided to ask here. I apologize in advance since this turned into an essay (all important info to take into consideration before replying). 

**My question:** ***Is the machine capable of producing coffee that will convince me to stop ordering?***  
  
and context:

First of all, I wouldn't consider myself a ""normal"" coffee drinker. I have tasted a great amount of different beans, blends, single origins and so on. I've been drinking (100% arabica) coffee since I was 14, I think, and I'm 27 now.

I've been reading about coffee, I think I know most parameters that would affect a cup, and I have worked in cafes in the past (the shops did not require barista training of any kind, as it was mostly Internet-cafe places).  However, since I'm located in Athens, Greece, good espresso can be found in almost every corner. Most people now lean towards better coffee and many shops offer coffee from fresh beans from local well known roasters (except for bakeries, convenience stores and such).

I am an avid coffee drinker. I need around 3-4 shots a day. Every morning, I drink 2 double espressos over ice (the freddo espresso as you'd call it here), and every evening I drink one (or two, half the time) double shot cappuccino. **No exceptions.**  
I get these delivered; I work from home. It's mostly blends, by the way. I used to order single origins but regretted it almost every time, as it was never extracted properly. I don't want to waste my money every time so I'm sticking to blends.  
My morning coffee would cost 3.30 euros on average, and evening coffee would cost 2.50 euros. If you include delivery tips and grabbing a bite every now and then, the average cost would be **more than 6 euros per day (which is more than 180 per month, and more than 2k per year.)**

A few years back I made the decision (or mistake?) to purchase a secondhand Gaggia Classic (the old version, pre-2015) and an Ascaso i2 Mini.   
I really, really enjoyed dialing-in the beans, studying more to make better cups and playing around. I did manage to get some decent shots. My need for coffee, however, outweighed my desire to experiment at that time. Later, I also tried getting a Hario Mizudashi, but cold brew was not cutting it for me. 

Also, I've been struggling with burnout, depression, and ADHD and therefore it was super difficult having to make coffee with that much effort, and not getting consistent results. So, I've been ordering coffee for a long time now.   
Ordering coffee is really expensive, and not convenient, as the weather might be bad (and I don't order when it's raining), or I don't have 30-40 minutes to spare until my coffee gets delivered.  
For reference, I'm making around 1000 euros a month, and coffee costs more than 180 euros per month.

Taking all of the above into consideration, stumbling upon this machine, I'm kind of convinced. It's super convenient and it (must be) yielding nice espressos. I can wake up, and make coffee as I go feed the cats, wash my face/teeth etc.   
I also started living with my boyfriend who has not touched a machine, but can recognize a well extracted coffee. So the convenience and the ""barista""-guidance the Sage offers, would be great for him too.  
The only downside though: the price. It's 1300 euros. I am willing to purchase the machine on a credit card in 12 interest-free payments, and I have even considered getting a loan. 

Even with the monthly payment, and even with adding the cost of the beans, milk and electricity, I would be saving money, provided that I stick to it, and not start getting coffee delivered again.   
  
**My question again: Is the machine capable of producing coffee that will convince me to stop ordering?**  
I haven't found any place in which I could try making one - or tasting one. I'm desperate!

I'd be eternally thankful for any assistance on the matter.",1,1729620923.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

It was cold, far colder than he had ever been. The snow and rocks crunched with every step and the air stung like needles on the back of his throat with every inhale. The wind alone made his bones feel like they were exposed, and the ambient negative 72 Fahrenheit wasn't making things any easier for Adam. There wasn't any smell to the air, it was just a dry bitter cold that was beyond what Adam would call frigid. With no trees in sight for miles the wind gave a howl as it carved it's path across the frozen continent with nothing to stand in its way. Nothing of course but two lone figures. They were dressed identically from head to toe. They both wore a thick insulated black knit cap, thick protective goggles that were tinted to protect the eyes from snow blindness, a balaclava to help prevent frostbite on their faces, an aggressively red parka that made them both stand out on the horizon, insulated mittens, wind pants, and the signature white bunny boots with a pressure regulator valve on the outside of their ankles. Even with all their protective gear, Adam could still feel the icy gusts cut through him, he knew without what he was wearing he wouldn't last more than five minutes at the most. As the wind whipped the ice and snow across their self-made path Adam spoke out as the gust chilled him to the bone.

 ""Jesus Dad, we've got to be getting close now right?"" 

Adam asked his father with a thick layer of frost covering his protective goggles.

His father laughed and exclaimed back to him.

""Oh don't tell me you're getting chilly now son! we've hardly been out here for 45 minutes!"". 

Adam Groaned with what tasted like frozen Iron in his throat 

""I know, I know, But it's beyond freezing out here to begin with, and not knowing where we're going isn't making this little expedition any easier."" 

He said with mild irritation. The condensation from his breath was only adding to his goggles, making him have to wipe them off with his mittens more often so he could keep a clean line of sight on the trail his father's footsteps were leaving behind for him. 

His father just chuckled and said 

""Well if I told you where we were going it wouldn't be as much fun now would it! You've got to trust your old man on this one, I really think you're going to love this if it is what I hope it is."" 

As far as Adam could remember his dad was always excitable when it came to exploration. Maybe going a bit over the top when it came to being prepared, having extra large hiking bags filled with plenty of food, water, tools, and of course extra camping gadgets that seemed a little gimmicky. But just the same Adam's dad loved going out for as long as possible and truly just experiencing nature to the best of his ability. His dad was the type of man to wake up at 3 AM to be hiking by 4 AM to see the sunrise by 5 AM.  He shared his dad's excitement normally but being this cold was new to him entirely. His dad was a Glaciologist for the Republic of Earth and something about this expedition had really gotten him fired up. The only other time he had seen him this worked up was when he prepared himself to jump down a waterfall in Fiji during a family vacation. He almost wished he could go back to the lush green warm tropical paradise that was Fiji. But seeing him just as excited made him curious, curious enough to briefly forget about Fiji.

 ""Can't you at least give me a hint, or maybe tell me how much longer until we can stop to warm up?"" 

Adam asked as his impatience grew further.

""I mean this is the first time I've been out here Dad!""

Adam had just turned 18 and the Republic only allows people 18 and above to go on these types of expeditions due to the intrinsic risk of it all. The research his father was doing was by no means safe, it required him to be here to report on the glaciers themselves that smattered this frozen terrain. He had to study them, understand their composition, analyze their movements. And there was no way to research Antarctic snow and ice without being sometimes knee-deep in it. He might be cold beyond belief, but he was excited to see firsthand what his dad got to do for the Republic.

His father was holding a handheld scanner that kept beeping while they talked, 

""A hint? hmmm let me see.."" 

His Dad said with a cheeky smirk 

""It's got something to do with ICE!"" 

he blurted out while laughing heartily. 

Adam rolled his eyes behind the now thicker layer of frost on his goggles. 

""Hard-ee har har Dad, and as for how much more of this until we get to wherever we're going?"" 

Adam shot back to his dad while wiping away yet another layer of self-made frost.

His father held up the scanner and turned around walking backward while looking at his son.

""If this thing isn't completely cooked and is actually being accurate than I'd think we were about 10 minutes out from your surprise"" 

Replied his father while still smirking behind his frozen beard. 

Adam gave a frozen sigh that pushed out water vapor from his face covering.

""Alright, fine, but why couldn't we keep taking the crawler? It might not have been quick but at least it was warm!"" 

He shouted over the cutting wind. The ""Crawler"" was actually called a Pisten Bully, It weighed just under 4 tons and had a max top speed of 25 kilometers per hour. It has tank-like treads and a cozy cabin built for around 2 to 3 passengers at a time. Up until about 45 minutes ago, they were slowly, though albeit comfortably travelling by what Adam had now lovingly nicknamed ""The Crawler"". It wasn't a fast way to travel by any means, but it provided them with heat and occasionally an involuntary back massage depending on the divets created by the strong antarctic winds better known as the katabatic winds. On top of just being warm, slow, and heavy it also sported a front-end plow attachment and a flatbed for carrying all of the gear Adam's dad had prepared for them.

His father turned back around and kept his pace while eyeing the beeping scanner 

""We could keep taking the pisten bully but that wouldn't get us to where we need to go"" 

He replied with a quickness as the scanner continued to slowly beep faintly. 

""Besides, if we got stuck in that thing all the way out here this far out from base we would be doing a whole lot of nothing while we wait for rescue to reach us"" 

Despite the fact that he was freezing he knew his dad wouldn't just make them go off trail for no reason. Before they left the warmth of the pisten bully they had loaded up their packs with a moderate amount of gear, supplies to survive should things go to shit. As he remembered the lingering feeling of heat leaving its mark on him from the safety of the crawler he did notice the deep ice trenches that his dad had formentioned not wanting to get stuck in. They were surprisingly deep for being at the end of the world with nothing but the elements to shape them. They were headed towards Mt. Erebus, an active volcano that many scientists stationed around the region studied. Adam didn't think his dad would take him to a bubbling volcano on his very first trip off McMurdo base, but even at the risk of being melted alive, he would be excited to be warm again. He began to wonder why his hint was 'something about ICE' if they were headed towards an active volcano.

""So Dad, how does Mt. Erebus; a literal liquid fire mountain, relate to ice? I just don't get what you mean"" 

Adam said as his father's scanner beeped on rhythmically. 

""Is there a scientist there that you know from working at McMurdo or something like that?"" 

Adam asked while trekking onward behind his dad's crunchy frozen footsteps. He thought the sound of them walking on the snow was interesting, despite the wind he could hear that the 'crunch' was different than back home during the winter. It sounded almost squeaky to him. 

""Mt Erebus? That's where you think we're going?"" 

His father exclaimed almost laughing. 

""No son, we're not going to Mt Erebus today. I wanted to show you something you could get close to, something you could really get your hands into. I mean sure we can get pretty close to the surface of the lava on the volcano but that's not quite what I had in mind for us today."" 

He told his son as the beeping started to get slightly faster from his scanner. It changed pitch right along with the speed, gradually getting higher and faster as they approached whatever their mystery plans were that his dad had laid out for them. 

""I think we're just about here, believe me or not I remember that big rock from when I came out here the first time on a routine ice core drilling run, come on! follow me son!"" 

His father told his son. To Adam calling it a 'Big Rock' was a bit of an understatement. A big rock would be like the size of a backpack, this one being called out by his dad was at least the size of a school bus. It had ice formed in seemingly random places all over its surface, like much of the rest of his surroundings it seemed like it was a light grey underneath all the ice and snow. He didn't understand how this one 'big rock' had wound up here in the first place, maybe it was at one point a huge molten projection from Mt Erebus itself.

Ian led Adam around the big icy rock to what appeared to be a column of pure ice, with a small flashing light emitting from a pole lodged into the ice itself. Adam was immediately happy to be behind something solid to block the wind, even if only slightly. At least now he could hear his Dad more easily & wasn't being actively frozen to his core so quickly by the sharp-cut arctic winds. After they got behind the cover of the boulder Ian excitedly announced to Adam 

""Well, we finally made it, we're here son! What do you think? Are you excited?"" 

Adam didn't quite get the built up hype made by his dad, he said back to him with a puzzled look on his face.

""Uh..a really big rock with an even bigger icicle next to it? or is it the flashing pole stuck into the ice?""

His father just shook his head and laughed a bit before pointing back to the pole. 

""Your mother told me you were top of your class, I sort of expected you to see beyond the rock and ice tower here. Take a closer look at the pole, check around there. And maybe wipe off your goggles again."". 

Adams puzzled face was slightly soured at his Dads words, he was at the top of his class back in school. He didn't like not understanding something, he always strove to be the best at whatever he did. So his dad saying there was something here beyond the obvious rock and pole made him begin to investigate more thoroughly. Like his dad said he began by wiping off his goggles of frost once more, he took off his bag and leaned it against the boulder. The weight now off of his shoulders was great, he almost forgot just how heavy 60 pounds of gear was in actuality. With his gear set aside, the wind being diminished, and a fresh pair of eyes to see with he began to circle the rock. He took note that the rock didn't have a completely smooth surface, and green, black, and white splotches of color. Just from what he could tell it looked like a chunk of Granite, but he still didn't understand what his dad was getting at about this spot with THIS specific rock. As Adam slowly circled the boulder his father watched him diligently with a smile present the entire time. What was he missing, was it not about the rock? Ian pulled down his Baklava to take a drink from his temperature controlled thermos, it smelled like coffee. A smell that had taken him off guard as there was almost nothing else to smell here. It distracted him for a moment as he realized his mouth began to water just enough to remember how the dry air had made his mouth taste like frozen iron.

His Father suddenly blurted out to Adam 

""Glacial erratics."" 

Adam paused his investigation and turned back to his father who still stood with his arms crossed wearing a smile visible now that his baklava was pulled down. 

""Glacial erratics? What's that got to do with anything? While we're on the subject what even IS that?"" 

Adam shot back with a tinge of irritated curiosity to his father. 

""Glacial erratics is why this rock is here in the first place, what did you notice about it?"" 

asked his father who smugly kept sipping his coffee amidst the frozen tundra. 

""Well, from the texture and coloration I was thinking it was granite"" 

Adam said with confidence in his voice. His father nodded his head back at him. 

""Mhmm, very good"" 

He said as he slapped a hand against the frozen rock twice. 

""But granite doesn't naturally form here, that's what's special about this rock. It happened to be here because of glacial erratics, at one point it was somewhere very far away and trapped within an iceberg. Until one day that iceberg traveled to here and melted away revealing this marvelous mysteriously placed big rock."" 

Explained his father. He still really seemed to like calling it a big rock. 

""But that's still not what brought us out here, not entirely anyway. What do you know about that tower of ice son?"" 

asked his father as he resealed his thermos from the elements still leaning on the rock where he slapped, the other hand supporting his hip. Adam didn't really know anything about them, this was the first time he'd ever seen such a thing in the first place. Adams face soured again as he had to admit a sort of defeat to his dad 

""As much as it bothers me to say this, I don't know anything about this thing. It's weird to me that ice formed upward like a tower seemingly from nothing. It just doesn't make much sense to me dad, what does this huge piece of displaced granite and this ice tower have in common?"" 

Adam asked with irritation in his once confident voice. His father moved from the rock and approached his son, he placed one hand on his shoulder and told him 

""Adam, there is nothing wrong with not knowing everything. You can't let that get you stuck when life hands you something new. It's exciting, to learn more about the world and all that inhabit it. The granite here was admittedly a red herring, I was hoping you would notice the pole stuck in the ice tower here more instead."" 

Ian said trying to encourage his son who was notably frustrated at being tricked. 

""Give it one more look, remember, really 'get your hands in it' son."" 

Said his father with a grin returning to his face.

Adam tried to shake off his frustration, there had to be something more he wasn't seeing yet, but what? As he approached the frosty structure his dad interrupted him briefly saying 

""OH, son, I almost forgot to tell you. The name of these ice towers, they're called fumarolic ice towers. They form near volcanic activity from within the earth. Some gasses escape and as they rise the outside temperature freezes the moisture into these lovely towers."".

Adam listened intently and hung on to his fathers words, these form from gasses? So this structure isn't like the boulder in one specific way, this structure could be hollow. With that thought he reached the base of the tower as his dad watched him closely. He looked at the pole with the flashing light and noticed that the ice around the base was differently colored, it almost seemed like it was a different kind of ice. Maybe newer? it was hard for him to tell. Adam reached near the base of the tower and grasped the pole as close to the ice as he could and tried to pull it free. It crackled but didn't budge an inch. He planted a foot against the base of the tower next to the pole and brought both his hands around the flashing light pole, he was going to get this thing unstuck and see why it was stabbed there in the first place no matter what the cost of his strength. He braced himself to yank with all his might, but as he went to pull his foot crashed through the tower and released the pole. After calming himself and noticing his dad looked tickled pink from him nearly busting his ass, he immediately noticed there was plenty of room for his leg in this new hole. No, not just a hole, a tunnel opening. One that seemed to get bigger beyond the entry point.

Ian handed Adam his bag again and said excitedly to his son. 

""I knew you could figure it out, you're my son after all. Just as curious about how stuff works in the world as me, but THIS is your surprise son. This scanner I've been carrying with us mapped this tunnel network out weeks ago, when I came out here with Jim to drill for ice cores we noticed this vast expansion under the ice. And well, with your 18th birthday coming up then I wanted to give you something really special to remember it by."" 

He told his son as he helped pick him back up onto his feet. 

""You'll find a few bits & bobs in your pack I readied for you, right now we're going to need an ice pick, some rope, and a lot of carabiners. Don't forget to grab your headlamp either, but son, I'm taking you down a brand new unexplored ice tunnel never before seen by human eyes."" 

Adams face lit up like the sun when he realized just what his surprise gift from his dad was, he was going to get to see what his Dad did for work. He was excited to see what the icy depths could hold from the world that he and his dad could go and reveal firsthand.
