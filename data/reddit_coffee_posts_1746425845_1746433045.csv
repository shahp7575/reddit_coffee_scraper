My opinion is that I really don't want to be in the middle of this.If he wants to have a relationship with my mom it's his choice and my mom's call.Why bother me?Apart from that I personally feel weird and awkward given it is my AP and my mom being the people in talk here.Also his ex-wife is an AP in another department and I would be in the bad side of her just incase if he involves with my mom.I understand that he is divorced,lonely and want some female company morally and physically (hence the desperation in his attempts).But isn't it unprofessional and unethical on his side? It's not like I don't want my mom to have a relationship.But the man here is my AP and it feels too weird for me.
What should I do now?

TLDR: Basically my lonely AP wants to have a relationship with my mom, acts desparate and pesters me a lot about it.Wanted to hear you guys' opinions on this and sort it out.

1kf6ayw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Germany_Jobs/comments/1kf6ayw/employer_cut_my_shift_legal/,Employer cut my shift - legal ?,"Hi everyone, I have a question regarding German labour laws as they might be much different than in my country (Poland), apparently. 

I am new to Germany and still learning the language so I genuinely appreciate your help as it is hard for me to google the answer. 

I managed to acquire a work in a coffee shop without German (yey!), but I’m not sure I trust the owner when it comes to labour law. I signed a contract for 32.5h a week. Last Friday my official schedule on the app, where we have to clock in and clock out was 10-19, but due to lack of customers the boss made me end shift at 18:00. 

In Poland I was a shop manager and lead the team of 8 people, one of my responsibilities was payroll and work schedule, thus I have a basic to medium understanding of labour laws in my country (still EU) and what my German boss ordered me to do would be illegal - the schedule needs to be officially published and the end of the month but at least 7 days before the beginning of the shift of the next month and cannot be changed without a consent of an employee. If we were in Poland, my German boss still would have to pay me for 10-19 shift, as it was officially published and i was let go without my consent (I have a witness). I’m very grateful for having a job without German so of course I didnt make a fuss about it, but would be grateful if one of you kind Redditors could point me on the right paragraf saying if my employer is right to change my work hours the day of the shift. 

Thank you all for help. ",1,1746432638.0,Germany_Jobs,0,1.0,False
1kf6ar5,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1kf6ar5/my_addiction_story_and_the_constant_search_for/,My addiction story (and the constant search for dopamine),"
Hi everyone! I’m 28 and have been diagnosed with ADHD, complex PTSD, and depression for about 3 years now. But even before I knew my brain was lacking dopamine — and before I had access to medication — I can now see that I was constantly chasing dopamine in all kinds of ways. Unconsciously, but intensely.

Right now, I’m unemployed (a whole ADHD story of its own), and I recently noticed I was getting completely hooked on Instagram reels. That made me stop and reflect on all the other addictions I’ve had over the years — and how incredibly easy it is for us to get hooked on things that offer quick dopamine.

- Early signs: sugar and soda

As a toddler, I was addicted to candy. I would throw full-blown tantrums when I couldn’t have it — not just the usual “I want candy” kind of thing, but a deep craving that felt like something was ripping through my chest.

Then around age 10, I became obsessed with Coca-Cola. I was drinking two liters a day and even started stealing bottles. I lied to my parents constantly, saying “it’s my first glass today” when I’d already had over a liter. It got so bad I started having regular stomach pain. I quit soda completely at 15 — and I’ve stayed clean since.

- Teen years: coffee and weed

At 17, coffee became my best friend. I was drinking up to 5 cups a day, and honestly… still struggling with that habit (heh).

Then, at 18, I tried weed for the first time — and I really regret it. I fell into daily use almost instantly. Wake and bake, smoking throughout the day, every day. I’m now 7 days sober, and while that might not sound like much, it’s honestly killing me. After nearly 10 years of smoking 24/7, I have no idea who I am without it. That’s terrifying.

- Screens and survival mode

Just a few days ago, I realized I was also addicted to Instagram reels. I uninstalled the app today, and while I’ve migrated over to Reddit (lol), at least here I’m reading and engaging — it feels a little more real.

Because I’m currently unemployed, I haven’t been able to afford my meds, which makes everything harder. The cravings, the boredom, the spiral — it’s all more intense. I find myself constantly reaching for weed or screen time just to feel something or to escape.

But I’m trying to be gentle with myself. Right now, I’m celebrating every single day I stay off weed — even if I’m a mess. Every sober day counts.",1,1746432613.0,adhdwomen,1,0.99,False

Some places *say* they do fine dining. Leddy’s actually delivers. This is food that makes you want to high-five the chef.

Take the beef fillet—so tender you could cut it with a spoon. It’s sat on a pile of sweet potato with a rich pepper sauce that’ll have you licking the plate when no one’s looking. And then there’s brunch. Forget sad eggs and dry toast—this is French toast drowning in caramel, grilled banana, and Fior di Latte ice cream. It’s breakfast, dessert, and a religious experience all in one.

Chuck in a glass of prosecco and call it a good life choice.

Notsa isn’t just a café—it’s breakfast, brunch, pizza, and a bar, all in one dangerously good spot. Kick off with a Champagne breakfast (because why not?), or go all in with the Notsa Fry Up—sausages, bacon, black pudding, hash browns, and eggs done your way.

Lunch? Hand-stretched pizzas, stacked burgers, and crispy fried chicken with sauces worth dunking everything in. By evening, the bar takes over with craft cocktails, top-notch ales, and spirits that mean business.

Come for brunch, stay for cocktails, leave whenever you finally admit you’re full.

Derby’s getting loud and you’re invited. INFLUX Festival is landing at The Electric Daisy with a full throttle lineup of indie goodness — and it won’t cost you a penny.

1kf64lx,https://v.redd.it/1o7yka626xye1,你还在砸钱买广告？分享一个更聪明的做法，让顾客主动帮你“带流量”,"很多中小企业主跟我说：“广告花了几千几万，结果流量起不来。”  
问题可能不在预算，而在于策略。

现在的消费者，特别是年轻人，对“广告”已经免疫。他们信的，是“别人推荐”，而不是品牌自己说自己有多好。

以下是我们在实际操作中验证过、比广告更有效的流量策略：

# 1. 打造“打卡感” – 让顾客主动分享你的品牌

你不需要再用折扣吸引顾客。相反，想办法让顾客“愿意拍照打卡”，他们会免费帮你宣传。

🔹 案例：Inside Scoop 和 Bubble Bee 这些品牌成功的关键，不只是便宜，而是“值得晒”。

📌 **执行建议**：

* 装修风格独特、有趣的互动区
* 包装设计带有话题性（限量、个性化、隐藏彩蛋等）
* 鼓励打卡换优惠的小型活动

# 2. 让品牌成为“社交话题” – 不用花钱，也能吸引大量曝光

你需要的不一定是更多预算，而是更好的玩法。

🔹 案例：

* **CHAGEE 的 Meow Meow Challenge**：顾客只需对店员喵两声就能免费奶茶，引爆 TikTok。
* **Tealive 的 K-Coffee**：结合韩流文化，自带话题。
* **Shopee 社交互动投票**：提高参与度和转化率。

📌 **执行建议**：

* 设计简单但有趣的挑战（例如：“5 秒喝完奶昔挑战”）
* 用户参与型活动（例如让粉丝决定新品口味）
* 与其他品牌联名，借力打力

# 3. 让顾客参与品牌共创 – 提升忠诚度和复购率

Z 世代不只是“消费者”，他们更想成为“参与者”。

🔹 案例：

* **Nike By You**：顾客自定义球鞋配色，销售大增。
* **Starbucks x Blackpink**：限量联名周边，社交媒体疯传。

📌 **执行建议**：

* 让顾客投票决定产品上架或活动形式
* 推出个性化订制服务或会员专属内容
* 搭建社群让顾客参与品牌内容共创

总结：与其砸钱买广告，不如投资“顾客的参与感”。

真正的社交媒体营销不是“推销”，而是“邀请顾客成为品牌的一部分”。如果你的品牌目前还在靠打折换曝光，或许该试试让顾客主动帮你说话。

1kf62ib,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kf62ib,Trip report: First trip through the German Eifel region,"**Starting off with some context:**  
Yesterday I completed my first bikepacking trip. I'm wanting to invest in a bike for bikepacking but before I did, I wanted to do a proper trip and see if it's for me. So I rented a gravel bike with bags from a small local rental business and set out for a four day trip through the Eifel region in Germany.

**The route:**  
I'm from Belgium myself, so my idea was to start and end in Belgium cities that are close to the german border in order to make getting to and from the start and end point easier. With this in mind, I created a route which starts in Arlon (BE), crosses the country of Luxemburg, loops through the Eifel National park and ends in the city of Eupen (BE). The route I planned was 270km with 3600 meter of elevation and a combination of gravel roads, asphalt cycleways, regular roads and some single- and doubletrack here and there. This came out to just under 70km a day, which seemed reasonable to me.  
Looking back after the trip, I can say I'm overall very glad with the route I crafted. The scenery was amazing and it was a great combination of passing through small towns and cruising through forests and fields. I departed at around 8:00 to 8:30 every morning and with lots of breaks I still arrived before 15:30 each day. The route did have some tough climbs but I guess this is just unavoidable in this region. I also don't mind having to suffer a bit: the fulfilment at the tops makes it all worth it.   
I do want to note that I trimmed down the route for the last day to about 56km due to the weather being really cold and me not wanting to get home really late in the day.

**The setup:**

*  Bike: Scott Addict (I think?) Gravel bike
   * GRX Groupset
   * Tubeless setup
* Bags:
   * Half frame bag from Topeak for toiletries, EHBO, bike lock, ... 
   * Saddle bag (no idea what the brand was) which housed my clothes
   * Vaude handlebar bag for my Big Agnes C Bar 3 tent
   * Toptube bag for power bank and bike necessities (multitool, chain wax, extra inner tube, ...)
   * Anything cage + dry bag for sleeping mat, sleeping bag and pillow
   * Agu snackpack (only not rented bag) for snacks and small items like sunglasses, keys,...
* Hydration:
   * 750ml bottle in bottle cage
   * Hydration backpack with 3L bladder: this backpack was also great for carrying snacks and other small items
* Cooking:
   * I brought a small gas burner and cooking pot for making coffee and cooking freeze-dried meals if I didn't feel like going to a restaurant

**Conclusion + takeaways + learnings:**  
Overal it was an amazing experience and I have to say I'm pretty hooked!  
The bag setup and packlist was already pretty spot on I must say: I don't feel like I overpacked and brought any unnecessary stuff and the weight seemed very reasonable. The only thing I messed up on is not bringing a warmer sleeping bag since the nights were still really cold this time of the year.  
The bike itself handled most of the route really well, I just wished the gearing would be a little easier on some climbs. I do know now that I have to look for a bike with easier gearing when buying a bike.

The hydration pack was really nice to have with me. Before the trip I was a bit concerned it would be really annoying but now I can say I really didn't find it annoying and having 3 liters of water with me and being able to drink so easily was really worth it. It also allowed me to carry some snacks and small items which was nice.

The campsites I stayed at were amazing: super nice people, amazing locations and all so clean and well accommodated. Also, the people I encountered and chatted with were also all really friendly.

I'm glad to answer any unanswered questions!",10,1746431626.0,bikepacking,2,1.0,False

I’m currently working on training a neural network for real-time sorting of small objects (let’s say coffee beans) based on a single class  - essentially a one-class classification or outlier detection setup using RGB images.

I’ve come across a lot of literature and use cases where people recommend using HSI (hyperspectral imaging) for this type of task, especially when the differences between classes are subtle or non-visible to the naked eye. However, I currently don’t have access to hyperspectral equipment or the budget for it, so I’m trying to make the most out of standard RGB data.

My question is: has anyone successfully implemented one-class classification or anomaly detection using only RGB images in a similar setting?

Three days ago, I decided that this week would be the week. Knowing that gave me a strange sense of peace—of closure. I felt genuinely free, like my life finally had some kind of purpose again. Not just wasting away on the couch or clocking in at a job that contributed nothing to the world.

I went to the pharmacy and bought two bottles of ibuprofen. They sat there on my nightstand. Every morning when I woke up, they were the first thing I saw. I’d just sit there, silently fantasizing about an overdose. About finally... ending things.

April 3rd. 1:30 a.m.

I turned off my phone, sat on the couch, and placed a glass of water on the coffee table in front of me. I opened one of the bottles and pulled out the little wad of cotton inside. For a second, I considered just dumping the whole thing into my mouth like candy—but I didn’t want to choke. I didn’t want to gasp for air and die convulsing on the floor. I wanted a quiet death.

I took a handful—ten pills or so—and downed them.  
First handful: no problem.  
Second: same.  
I gagged about halfway through the bottle, but after a minute of sitting still, I was back at it.  
Pouring. Drinking. Swallowing.  
Over and over, until both bottles were empty.

And then... a wave of euphoria.

People always say death is terrifying. But to me? It was freeing. It was like something heavy had been lifted off my shoulders. Like for once, I could breathe.

About twenty-five minutes later, the side effects kicked in. My head started spinning. Nausea twisted in my gut. My mouth dried out, my lips cracking. The headache hit next—sharp, pounding.

It wasn’t pleasant. But I didn’t fight it. I welcomed it. The pain now was worth the peace I believed was coming.

But it didn’t come.

I remembered reading it would take 45 minutes to die. But I was still here. And worse—my body felt heavy. My limbs were like cement blocks. I couldn’t move.

I glanced at the clock.

**3:37 a.m.**  
I should’ve been gone by now.

Then it hit me:  
Was this death?  
Was I just stuck here… with my thoughts… forever?

Panic set in. Real, soul-crushing panic.  
I thought about something I’d heard once—**White Room Torture**.  
A kind of psychological punishment where you’re locked in total isolation. No sights, no sounds, no time, no touch. All your senses—gone.

It felt like that.  
Minutes passed. Then hours. Then... days.  
Still, I stared at the clock.  
**3:37 a.m.**  
It never changed.

Please believe me when I say this—I sat there for what felt like **weeks**. Alone. Completely and utterly alone. No peace. No relief. Just panic. Dread.

Time crawled. Seconds stretched out. My mind… started breaking.  
I cycled through every thought I’ve ever had.  
School lessons. Childhood memories. The same damn three songs stuck in my head. The same colors, looping over and over again.

And the clock.  
**3:37 a.m.**

Then, after what felt like **forever**, I heard something.

Not a sound, exactly. More like… a voice. Mechanical. Cold. It said just two words:

**“752 days.”**

That was it.

Confusion smacked me in the face.  
“Seven hundred fifty-two days?” What the hell does that mean?

Then—silence again.

No explanation. No noise. No sense of time. Just that message, echoing in my skull.

**752 days.**

I looked back at the clock.  
Still **3:37 a.m.**

My thoughts fell apart. Nothing made sense anymore. Words blurred. Memories twisted. Just a constant, buzzing mess of static and voices in my head.

Then, it all stopped.

No transition. No warning. Just... stillness.

I opened my eyes.

Fluorescent lights.  
The soft beep of a heart monitor.

I was in a hospital.

Why?  
How?

Didn’t I die?

The nurse said they found me unconscious on my couch. They pumped my stomach. I’d been in a coma.

1kf5vuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kf5vuc/am_i_overreacting_about_my28m_girlfriends27f/,Am I overreacting about my(28M) girlfriend’s(27F) social media presence and her dynamic with her ex?,"Hello Reddit,  
This is my first ever post here, so please bear with me. Things are complicated between me (28M) and my girlfriend (27F). We’ve been dating for a little over three months. It’s still a new relationship, and everything feels fresh sometimes confusing.

I work in finance, and she’s an English teacher. From the beginning, we had some issues. After she and her ex broke up, he continued to pay her rent. The situation got weird when I found out he told her, “I’m paying the rent, so you’re not allowed to bring any man into this house. It would be disrespectful.”

Naturally, that made me uncomfortable. I’d like to be able to go to my girlfriend’s place for coffee or breakfast like any normal couple would. When I brought this up, she got frustrated and said, “You say there’s a problem, but you never do anything to solve it. Rent me a house then, and you can come whenever you want.”

Now, while I *am* financially capable of doing that, we were barely a month into dating at the time. Why would I rent an apartment for someone I just started seeing? And honestly, where’s the independence in that? After their breakup, another girl moved in with her, and now they’re both living rent free. I can’t help but wonder why not work harder and pay for your own place instead of depending on someone you’re no longer with?

Relationship wise, everything else seems great. The intimacy, emotional connection, and affection are strong. But there are other issues gnawing at me.

One major area of tension is social media. We see it very differently. She’s extremely active posting stories at least three times a day. That’s fine, I respect self expression. But what gets to me is the sexual nature of some posts. She has photoshoots where she’s showing sideboob, wearing very revealing outfits, or doing choreographed dances in high heels and sexy clothing. She considers these posts a form of art. That’s her perspective.

But here’s where it gets tricky she still follows her ex, and he often likes these kinds of posts. When I see that, it honestly makes me feel sick. I get that some people might say I’m being insecure, but I don’t think it’s about confidence. I just don’t like the idea of random men and especially her ex consuming her sexual energy online. Her profile is public, so anyone can watch. Sure, guys on the street might stare, but in real life, I can stand by her side. On social media, I don’t even know who’s watching.

To me, if you’re planning something long term, it makes sense that your sexual energy and expression would be directed primarily toward your partner, not the entire internet.

In fact, to support her and show I was trying to understand her views, I even bought her a gimbal so she could make her videos with better quality. But yesterday, something happened that really shook me.

She was telling me about a friend she doesn’t talk to anymore. Apparently, after breaking up with her ex at the time, she called her male friend (M) and asked to stay at his place without informing *his* girlfriend, who was also her friend. When his girlfriend found out, she cut ties with my girlfriend. My girlfriend told me she was upset about this, but I said, “You were in the wrong. Common courtesy would’ve been to talk to the girlfriend first.”

She got defensive and said, “He was a close friend,” and I responded, “Well, he made his choice by siding with his girlfriend, and that’s fair.” Then she said something that completely stunned me: “Yeah, he chose her, but he still likes all my dance videos and my pictures.”

That sentence hit me like a truck. It confirmed a suspicion I’ve had deep down that she knows her content is sexual and is aware of *who* is engaging with it. And in that moment, I felt like a fool for buying her that gimbal. Did I just help her present herself in a more sexualized way for public attention?

That statement shattered all the progress I had made in trying to accept her use of social media. I had convinced myself it was just art and self-expression. But that comment made me feel like maybe I was right all along to be concerned.

When I talk to my friends about this, some of them warn me not to let myself be used. They say I always pay when we go out, which is true but I don’t mind. I make significantly more money than her, and I prefer that she spends her money on herself. I also buy groceries and gifts for her. In return, she’s bought me a shirt and a coffee mug. It’s not balanced, but I believe she’s trying in her own way, and I appreciate that.

Still, this social media issue won’t leave my mind. I don’t like how openly sexual her content is, and it hurt deeply when she said, “Rent me an apartment, then.” She later told me she only said that out of frustration, and I’ve tried to let it slide but the feeling lingers.

I feel disappointed and conflicted. I always thought she was being genuine when she said she was posting to inspire other women and express herself. But now I’m questioning all of it. Am I overreacting?

Thanks for reading. Every comment will mean a lot to me. I’m truly trying to understand if this is something I need to work on within myself, or if it’s a legitimate issue that I shouldn’t ignore.",2,1746430790.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

Tank will be no a low tech CO2, possibly riparium or a full tank I havn't decided yet. Sicce shark pro internal filter, AquaEL Ultra heater (maybe on an inkbird), Hygger LED light.

Ive kept a few tanks in the past but this will be my first foray back into the hobby for a decade, other than a small 40l tank which currently holds 4 Oto's (there were 6, 1 vanished, 1 was lost to the crappy filter which is being replaced in a day or two, I realise they need a larger group and tank, this will be remedied) so have been obsessively researching and reading up. Ive had Malawi Cichlids, Gourami community etc. in the past.

Ive a good list of plants that should do well (enough) without CO2, and am primarily looking for some feedback on a few species/community setups which ive put together trying to keep in mind the dimensions of my tank. Id rather understock and keep to a smaller selection of species than overstock. I kind of like the idea of a theme tank without commiting to a biotope (particularly due to restrictions of no CO2). Id like to do something a little different to a general community. Im not looking for anything too hyper, id prefer a calmer tank so this maybe rules out or limits Danios and Barbs (I love the Odessa barb, but those guys drink too much coffee....)....

  
My water is PH 7-7.5 and soft out of the tap, I have a lot of water butts for changes etc.





SETUP 1 - Puffer paradise

8-12 Pea puffers - My wife loves them, im on the fence. As the tank would be upstairs im dubious about the amount of water changes that are recommended. I understand theres some finicky particulars with group composition, water quality etc. 

In a well planted tank in a good group, what are the chances they would co-exist with a shoal of Otos?

  
SETUP 2 - Africa

\~6 Gardneri Killifish, 6-10 Congo Tetra, 2 Kribensis (or 3/4 upside down cats?). I love this combo, but im unsure on compatibility with water flow rate, swimming space for the Congos and aggression from the Kribs towards the Congos. 

Chap in LFS suggested n Island style aquascape which may allow the Congos more swim space (rather than length ways they would have a full 'circuit' around the tank)?

Would the height of the tank ease aggression?

  
SETUP 3 - South America

2/3 Apistoramma, 6-12 Hatchetfish, 6-12 Pencilfish. I know Apisto's really are either in a breeding tank, or a community tank, but from wat ive researched I wonder if this could work as both, the peaceful top dwelling fish should stay well away from the Apisto's and act as a dither fish? Any thoughts.

  
SETUP 4 - Cool tank

6-12 Peppered Corys, 10-15 White Cloudmountain minnows, assorted Killifish. I quite like the idea of a low temp setup, 20/21C with some easy fish as stock, and then some Killis at the top, maybe even growing on some annual Killifish fry and allowing them into the tank for their final growth, display and breeding? Or just a stock of Clown Killis or Gardneri or Golden Lyre.

Consistently had issues with running out of necessary supplies (cafe, things like milk, coffee beans etc)

My BOH manager places the orders because they kept getting angry when I placed my own, so we had a system. 

Couldn’t figure out how/why we kept running out of shit when I was confident I was ordering enough.

Turns out they were purposefully under-ordering or not ordering at all due to “other FOH staff telling me insurmountable times that we don’t need as much as you think we need”

Mind you, I order backstock of non perishables and have never had to throw my perishables away, I’m good at eyeing what we need.

But there’s an employee that was upset at not getting my position (voiced it to me) who’d been passive aggressively undermining me with the help of BOH manager - so I walked.

I walked on the busiest weekend of their year.

On a day when they ran out of necessary supplies due to the blatant sabotage. But I did have our upper management looped into that thread where my BOH manager admitted they were doing this on purpose and framing it as an issue of ME over ordering supplies so to retaliate they stopped ordering at all.

Based on how crucial it is to get adequate sleep, I was hoping to get some advice/recommendations on the following:

Is it better to stay up late (2-3 hours past one's usual bedtime) and study (I should note this will involve a laptop and constant staring into a screen) I'll also add this will be on sheer willpower, no use of caffeine this late in the day.

Or...

Is it better to wake up early (again, 2-3 hours before one's usual wake up time) and study (same scenario, constant staring into a laptop screen) coffee added to the mix.

Note that total sleeping hours will be affected, instead of getting the usual 6-7 hours per night, it'll be closer to 5-5,5 hours.

# What is The Video Ad Academy - Meg Jackson?

Let’s cut to the chase: **The Video Ad Academy - Meg Jackson** is your one-stop course for learning how to make killer video ads that *actually* convert. Whether you’re a total beginner or someone who’s dabbled with ads before, this course gives you a complete roadmap—from idea to execution. It’s not just about making pretty videos; it’s about making videos that *sell*. That’s where Meg’s 7 Elements of a Great Ad™ Framework comes in. This isn’t fluff—it's actionable stuff you can plug straight into your biz.

# Who is it For?

The real beauty of this course? It works for almost anyone in the digital space. If you’re a **marketing pro** looking to up your ad game, a **small biz owner** trying to get more eyeballs on your products, a **content creator** wanting to monetize smarter, or even a **student** curious about video marketing, you’re covered. No need to have a huge ad budget or a film degree. Just bring your willingness to learn.

# Why You Should Care

Let’s be real—**video ads are everywhere** right now. If your brand isn’t using video effectively, you’re probably being ignored. That’s the harsh truth. What makes **The Video Ad Academy - Meg Jackson** stand out is that it teaches you how to not just make videos, but how to make *strategic* ones. We’re talking ads that grab attention, speak directly to your audience, and drive real results—whether that's sales, sign-ups, or followers.

# When Will You Start Seeing Results?

Honestly? Pretty quickly—*if* you do the work. The course is designed for speed and clarity. There are 24 bite-sized video lessons broken into four smart modules: fundamentals, ad types, creation, and dialing in performance. There’s even a bonus section for advanced stuff. Follow along, apply what you learn, and you’ll start seeing improvements in your ad quality and ROI faster than with trial-and-error methods.

# Where Can You Take It?

At just $35, **The Video Ad Academy - Meg Jackson** is a total steal. It’s jam-packed with value, expertly taught, and proven to work. Over 55,000 students and $6 million in sales later, it’s clear this isn’t just another generic online course—it’s a powerhouse. If you want to master video ads without the overwhelm, this is *the* course to take.",1,1746429350.0,TaunDownload,1,1.0,False

I am born and raised in Buffalo,NY,am currently single,and have 3 cats i wouldnt trade for the world. I have a degree in Baking and Pastry arts,and my main focus is being a cake decorator,but have also been a pastry cook,as well as a line cook (never again). 

I have found that my city is becoming far too overran by a lot of old stuffy conservative republican boomers and gen x,and just want to get out of here.This is one of America's most segregated cities,and the local gov is littered with so much corruption that holds our city back from any real improvement. This place also lacks the amount of ""fun and unique"" local businesses that I often notice are in other larger cities. 

Where can i move that has

-low cost of living (i currently make $20 an hour and pay $1135/month for a 1100sqft 2bdrm apt) i dont make a whole lot doing what i do,and likely never will unless i can get my own business off the ground.

-high amount of goth subculture places (such as goth nightclubs),as well as a thriving BDSM culture with things like public dungeons would be awesome!

-i also have experience working as a stripper when i need extra money,so ideally it would be a place with a decent amount of strip clubs to choose from 

-lots to do for someone who doesnt rlly enjoy sports or recreation (i hike,sometimes fish,tent camp,and like going to the park for a picnic,i just dont like ski,surf,mountain bike,ect ect) or drink. i will drink sometimes casually but bars are not really my scene unless invited. im more of a ""night cafes,comedy clubs,cat cafes,weed lounges,and goth clubs"" type lady.I love checking out weird local businesses like oddity shops,weird and interesting museums (NOT into art museums),weird interactive art installations,goth and punk clothing stores (!!!!!!),vintage shops,thrifts shops,flea markets,farmers markets,ect ect. 

-thriving amount of local bakeries and cake shops i could get a job at,or similarly fun and creative jobs such as coffee shops,dispensaries,goth related businesses,sex shops,ect anything local,i hate corporate entities

-large amount of young very progressive liberal people,bonus if theyre lots of LGBT and similar support systems. I cant stand being surrounded by really rude shitty capitalistic conservative people everyday where im at now.

-needs to be affordable to live downtown,or at least in the immediate area,or have good public transport,as I dont currently own a vehicle (working on it) and so i cant live anywhere super rural or isolated.

-weed must be legal recreationally. that is literally my ONLY vice aside from coffee. thats it. i cant give that up completely

-i am a 5'3"" single woman who lives alone and does not enjoy having roommates. I need to not only b able to afford to live alone,but also be able to feel safe in my neighborhood.

I have strongly considered Portland,OR or Seattle,WA,and have always dreamed of California,but i have no actual experience with these cities,as all of my family is here towards the east coast. So i would also be pretty much all alone with no friends or family to help me,but tbh a lot of my friends abandoned/outgrew me recently,so i dont currently have a lot of friend id be leaving behind.

Growing up, I was interested in Australian Rules football (I supported Geelong), V8 Supercars (I supported Ford since they sponsored Geelong), and extreme sports, and mostly listened to metal music (nu metal from when I was 8-14; older metal when I was 14-17).

When I was about six, the things I'd make with Lego would be made up as I went along. But when an older cousin visited and I saw all the cool things he could make, I asked him, ""How does yours always turn out so good?"" ""I just thought of what I wanted to make, then made it"", he replied. This was a revelation to me, and a milestone in my development; it marked me starting to get the hang of 'planning ahead'. As a result, the next thing I made turned out a lot better, and I was elated. That night, after we went to bed, he taught me some inappropriate song.

When I was a bit older, I remember going to the beach with my older step-brother. We listened to Limp Bizkit on the way there (terrible band, I know, but it felt 'cool' to listen to 'explicit' music at that age), watched this Simpsons VHS with four episodes on it (back when The Simpsons was still good), watched Austin Powers (not a fan now, but at the time it felt 'adult'; my step-brother ended up saying quotes in his sleep), and played Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX on the PlayStation. I thought my step-brother was the coolest guy. He exposed me to so much music, and I'd copy how he dressed. He's schizophrenic now.

When I was a bit older than that, I visited a different, older, previously-dinosaur obsessed cousin a few towns over. He taught me more things than probably anyone, like how to kick a football properly (""Point your toe like a ballerina"", he said), spell fuck (I spelled it 'fak', and he said ""That's a bit like 'fake'""), use a cricket bat properly (""You're batting like a pro now"", he said afterwards), build bike jumps (we built a tabletop and a berm), and take apart and spray paint bikes. He also exposed me to a lot of music, like Blink-182 and 28 Days. We'd gotten to that age where we could ride our bikes around town unsupervised, so we rode into town, he put a Ecko cool shirt on lay-by, we did some other stuff, then went home. He then said ""You didn't think (town) was that big, did you?"", and I said ""No."" I felt so old and mature.

When I was a bit older than that, when riding my bike around town was still new and cool to me, I rode to a more affluent, green Holden Commodore SS-owning friend's house for the first time. He was one of those 'nice popular' kids. His house was kind of a 'McMansion', but I was spellbound nonetheless. I remember the first time I saw his bedroom: he showed me his expensive stereo, and we listened to Chop Suey! by System Of A Down; he had this cool jewelry box; he showed me this poster on the inside of his closet door that said 'Piss Off!', which I thought was so cheeky and cool, since I didn't really swear at home (""I didn't write it"", he joked); he showed me his brother's secret weed stash; we played this computer game where you beat up Osama bin Laden, back when knowing about 'cool' websites was like some cool secret knowledge; we stole a beer, had a sip each, and threw it down a hill; and went cruising in his 'paddock bomb', which in Australia is an old car you drive on private property and backroads.

And when I was a bit older than that, I won an Encouragement Award for playing football. I adored football, and practiced it constantly. But this was the first and only trophy I've ever won for playing it, so it became one of my most prized possessions; I remember how happy it made me. I broke it a few years later from kicking the football inside, and was devastated, but since it was only made of plastic, my mum took it to the trophy place and got it fixed.

After contracting a debilitating illness, I started escaping into even 'rougher' music, and have particularly good memories of late 2000s hip hop. I'd watch its music videos in my mum's house on an apple orchard; it's visual style makes me feel nostalgic. I also started browsing luxury lifestyle websites around this time, which also make me feel nostalgic; they made me realize how big the world was.

Because of my illness, the best memories of my adult life have been things like waking up early, experiencing that feeling of nobody else being up, drinking black coffee, browsing my favorite subreddit, and having the light gradually come through the window on a mild morning, or watching Rage, an Australian music video show, on a Saturday morning, while being reminded of the 2000s, especially Will Smith and Men in Black II for some reason (maybe his music video for the Men in Black II music video came on, or maybe the 2000s special effects of another music video reminded me of him and Men in Black II), then walking down the street to buy cookies when a song I didn't like came on, and at the end, feeling like the morning had been well spent.

I have better taste in things now, but I still smile whenever those memories come back to me.",1,1746429301.0,2000sNostalgia,0,1.0,False

I remember the first time I saw his bedroom: he showed me his expensive stereo, and we listened to Chop Suey! by System Of A Down; he had this cool jewelry box; he showed me this poster on the inside of his closet door that said 'Piss Off!', which I thought was so cheeky and cool, since I didn't really swear at home (""I didn't write it"", he joked); he showed me his brother's secret weed stash; we played this computer game where you beat up Osama bin Laden, back when knowing about 'cool' websites was like some cool secret knowledge; we stole a beer, had a sip each, and threw it down a hill; and went cruising in his 'paddock bomb', which in Australia is an old car you drive on private property and backroads.

And when I was a bit older than that, I won an Encouragement Award for playing football. I adored football, and practiced it constantly. But this was the first and only trophy I've ever won for playing it, so it became one of my most prized possessions; I remember how happy it made me. I broke it a few years later from kicking the football inside, and was devastated, but since it was only made of plastic, my mum took it to the trophy place and got it fixed.

After contracting a debilitating illness, I started escaping into even 'rougher' music, and have particularly good memories of late 2000s hip hop. I'd watch its music videos in my mum's house on an apple orchard; it's visual style makes me feel nostalgic. I also started browsing luxury lifestyle websites around this time, which also make me feel nostalgic; they made me realize how big the world was.

Because of my illness, the best memories of my adult life have been things like waking up early, experiencing that feeling of nobody else being up, drinking black coffee, browsing my favorite subreddit, and having the light gradually come through the window on a mild morning, or watching Rage, an Australian music video show, on a Saturday morning, while being reminded of the 2000s, especially Will Smith and Men in Black II for some reason (maybe his music video for the Men in Black II music video came on, or maybe the 2000s special effects of another music video reminded me of him and Men in Black II), then walking down the street to buy cookies when a song I didn't like came on, and at the end, feeling like the morning had been well spent.

I have better taste in things now, but I still smile whenever those memories come back to me.",1,1746429230.0,2000s,0,1.0,False

I practice mindfulness, meditate and journal and really got the most out if my day. 

Even if it’s sitting in the garden enjoy a cup of coffee. I convinced my wife to get he dream car because life is too damn short! So I have actually had lots of positive days. But then we had an argument yesterday about the last time she turned me down for sex (Friday).

In this argument with my wife (LL) I said sex is permanently off the table so no pressure but let’s just get “something” back. I felt super energised. Like it was progress. I was re framing the problem - wow I’m so clever I have solved all of our problems! (No I’m stupid -read on).

So it’s all great right? Well no. I’m obsessed with the fact that my dad died 35 years older than me. It’s become some kind of magic number. I have 35 years to get the car I wanted, 35 years of great sex… oh I dear that’s a fuck up. Sure my wife’s not gonna hold “you said no to any sex!!” But it still feels like it. 

Last night I was spiralling. It felt like I was mourning two things. The loss of my father and the loss of my sex life. This doesn’t fit the “make of most of everyday!” approach I have taken and I only have 35 years to enjoy my life. I just waved goodbye to my sex life in our conversation\argument. 

It’s just sad.

The one silver lining is that the communication channels are open and I can discuss this with my wife. Sex has always been the one things I can’t talk about but now I guess I can. I can say I feel sad because of these reasons. I don’t expect anything. It’s just a no strings conversation. 

I guess it’s a sad situation but both parties are fully aware of each others feelings and frustrations. It’s food to talk right? And perhaps hug too - hugs are nice. ",1,1746429225.0,DeadBedrooms,0,1.0,False

1kf5i29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kf5i29/i_might_like_my_stalker/,I Might Like My Stalker,"TL;DR Fell in love/maybe like my stalker, don’t know if it’s okay to feel this way under the circumstances


(F23) I think I like my stalker, I really don’t know what to do and it’s hard to look for answers on this sort of thing. 

For obvious reasons this is a throwaway. Please don’t message me personally on the matter. I don’t know when I’ll get the chance to see them. And I’m really struggling as is.

For backstory, I came to the conclusion that I was being stalked around the month of October in 2024. At first it started with there being weird or “ominous” notes left on the windshield of my car when I left work. One specifically was one asking for my coffee order and a phone number I could hardly read. I threw it away because I thought it was a joke and I was tired so I didn’t want to entertain it being anything other than someone messing with me. Turns out it was not a joke, because I threw it away and a few days after I found the same note on my window. Not the same exact one that I threw it away, but it was like wrote it again. Crappy shaky handwriting again. I’d like to also mention I sometimes leave work late and have to go to the garage by myself, and I didn’t wanna bring this issue to my friends at work because I prefer to keep a private life. Regardless how stupid that may sound. I did not think it was necessary to bring up because I personally wasn’t worried.

After ignoring those two notes and one extra they seemed to stop very quickly. Fast forward to I think mid ?? January, I began to notice that on my way to work there was always a black Sedan that would always seem to be either in the lane opposite from me or a few cars behind me as if it was trying to keep up with me but not be so obvious. By this time I had forgotten those notes on my car. At first I thought I was just paranoid and tried thinking of the people I may have wronged in the past. I was almost VERY sure that I must’ve stepped on the toes of someone to make them so angry with me to the point of following me. But as many times as I tried to come up with an answer, I blanked. This instance occurred at least 3 times give or take another time. The last time they drove past where I park in the garage at work, before taking the exit at the opposite end. And before you ask me how I know it was the same car, I’ll get to that later. Because I also questioned myself and my memory too because I don’t really feel like I have a good memory to begin with. 

Anyways, a few weeks later after the fact I went to a coffee shop only like 7 minutes away from where I work. I go there every other day or daily if I have less work. I know the people there pretty well, to the point they always give me a discount. It’s funny because I started to question if it was one of them?? Playing a silly joke on me, because we’d make jokes together a lot on my way out the door. I tried to let go of that idea as fast as I possibly could.

When I was walking to my car, I saw the same exact Sedan that I SWEAR had been following me weeks prior. I instantly started to feel a rush of anxiety assuming the worst thing, which I normally don’t feel unless I’m really stressed out. Otherwise I don’t experience anxiety much. I felt stupid with how I must’ve rushed to my car so fast nearly bumping into people around me. But I didn’t care as long as I got to my car. It was broad daylight so I tried to calm myself down. No one would approach me even if they could in daylight right? I was so wrong. 

As I’m trying to put my coffee away in the car and my laptop for work, I get in my car and instantly a guy I had never seen a day in my life starts banging on my window before I can pull out of my spot. But not like aggressive, almost like he was warning me I left something on the top of my car kind of way. Already terrified, I kind of snapped at him and scolded him. I didn’t know it was him I was just angry this person caught me off guard for whatever reason I didn’t care. He genuinely seemed apologetic. I didn’t think it was him stalking me, I didn’t think someone this sheepish looking could be responsible for something like that. I asked him what he wanted and he started to explain that he had seen me and wanted to ask for my number months prior but he didn’t want to seem creepy. 

I told him it was very creepy what he was doing and honestly I was really mean about it (which you would’ve been too if you were me so don’t judge me) I’m keeping some details out because I’m afraid if this is any longer no one will read it. 

He seemingly understood why I was so angry and said that’s why he didn’t really continue to try and talk to me for the first few months. Which I didn’t believe to be honest but whatever. 

Worst part is he isn’t bad looking at all to me. Not like a stereotypical “stalker” they might have in some movies. And I’m not saying he’s like a model or anything, neither am I, but he had many attributes i often find attractive. Long hair, dark eyes dark brows. It honestly disgusted me someone I found to be attractive would do such a thing though. 

I confronted him about him following me and the whole garage ordeal and he said he was hoping I’d call the number on the note. I basically said “Well first off I thought it was a joke, and your handwriting is not very good sorry” he seemed a bit taken aback by that and almost annoyed?? And then when I brought up the fact he literally drove in my work garage past my car and how that was creepy as hell that he knows the time I get to work since he did it THREE TIMES. He chalked it up to it being “a good guess” since based off my car I obviously work a 9-5 job?? Whatever that means. He also tried to argue he did it only twice. Like that made it any better he was trying to justify it to my face!! I was fuming but I managed to calm down when he explained that he thought it was less creepy to leave a note on my car versus come up to me while I was alone.I tried to tell him that if he just came up to me I would’ve been more likely to give him the time of day. 

I actually felt bad for him, since he did seem sorry and tried to say he just thought I was so beautiful he didn’t know what to do with himself. I’ll admit I was flattered but I was still creeped out and pissed off by this time. And he was falling all over his words I didn’t even know what to say. I asked him his age for starters because he looked a bit young. I said earlier in the story that I’m 23. He said he was also 23. Kinda didn’t believe him but he had enough facial hair for me to believe it I guess? 

Anyways, we exchanged numbers and began talking over text for a few months. Just simple talk, and each time he managed to apologize for being weird almost in a self loathe way every chance he got. But it was genuine to me. We began to talk over phone as well, and it’s like we became friends so easily. We have a weird amount of things in common like likes, dislikes and even beliefs. Different hobbies by FAR. But I found myself feeling guilty by the fact I found him creepy but I am extremely attracted to his personality and the way he talks. I caught myself feeling almost enamored with him? I kept replaying how apologetic he was and I almost felt like I was responsible for his emotions. 

I really hope I’m not alone in this case. I feel like I can’t even really call him a stalker anymore because we’re getting close and he makes me feel happy. I don’t have any romance or many close relationship’s in my life and this is the closest thing I’ve gotten to it because I’m so used to sticking to my work and that’s about it. I live alone in a studio apartment and have no pets. He keeps making jokes about me being his girlfriend and how he’d treat me so well and that I wouldn’t want for anything that he’d love me and be so loyal. He constantly brings up how gorgeous he thinks I am and how he would kill to have someone like me. And I guess I found that odd because I’m really nothing special in all honesty I’m not even just saying that.

I won’t lie I was actually thinking about it despite the fact I basically laughed anytime he brought up that idea. I don’t think he’s at all a bad guy despite his actions and I think that this situation could’ve ended up way worse for me had it been anybody else. I think he’s just overly insecure and shy, and I couldn’t help but forgive him for scaring the life out of me that day. 

I’m scared because I love my independence and being by myself, but apart of me is wondering if the universe sent him to me to love?? I know that may sound stupid and ridiculous and some people may scold me in the comments for being so naive and not calling the cops on him, but I don’t think the cops would’ve helped in this case to be honest anyway especially since the severity wasn’t bad. 

He texts me every single day, and often checks in on me to ask how I am. We have not hung out at all mind you especially because of my busy work schedule and I’m still kind of trying to feel him out because I wonder if he’s putting on a facade and I still don’t think I trust him. He’s really respectful but he does seem a bit needy and persistent when it comes to calling me currently around the time I am posting this.

Growing up, I was interested in Australian Rules football (I supported Geelong), V8 Supercars (I supported Ford since they sponsored Geelong), and extreme sports, and mostly listened to metal music (nu metal from when I was 8-14; older metal when I was 14-17).

When I was about six, the things I'd make with Lego would be made up as I went along. But when an older cousin visited and I saw all the cool things he could make, I asked him, ""How does yours always turn out so good?"" ""I just thought of what I wanted to make, then made it"", he replied. This was a revelation to me, and a milestone in my development; it marked me starting to get the hang of 'planning ahead'. As a result, the next thing I made turned out a lot better, and I was elated. That night, after we went to bed, he taught me some inappropriate song.

When I was a bit older, I remember going to the beach with my older step-brother. We listened to Limp Bizkit on the way there (terrible band, I know, but it felt 'cool' to listen to 'explicit' music at that age), watched this Simpsons VHS with four episodes on it (back when The Simpsons was still good), watched Austin Powers (not a fan now, but at the time it felt 'adult'; my step-brother ended up saying quotes in his sleep), and played Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX on the PlayStation. I thought my step-brother was the coolest guy. He exposed me to so much music, and I'd copy how he dressed. He's schizophrenic now.

When I was a bit older than that, I visited a different, older, previously-dinosaur obsessed cousin a few towns over. He taught me more things than probably anyone, like how to kick a football properly (""Point your toe like a ballerina"", he said), spell fuck (I spelled it 'fak', and he said ""That's a bit like 'fake'""), use a cricket bat properly (""You're batting like a pro now"", he said afterwards), build bike jumps (we built a tabletop and a berm), and take apart and spray paint bikes. He also exposed me to a lot of music, like Blink-182 and 28 Days. We'd gotten to that age where we could ride our bikes around town unsupervised, so we rode into town, he put a Ecko cool shirt on lay-by, we did some other stuff, then went home. He then said ""You didn't think (town) was that big, did you?"", and I said ""No."" I felt so old and mature.

When I was a bit older than that, when riding my bike around town was still new and cool to me, I rode to a more affluent, green Holden Commodore SS-owning friend's house for the first time.

1kf5gxx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kf5gxx,Help with CafeRomatica by Nivona,"Dear Community,

I'm humbly asking for some advice concerning the Nivona CafeRomatica machine that I inherited.
I descaled the machine and cleaned the brewing unit before using.

I already had machines like these but never from Nivona, and I have two main issues with this machine.

1. Coffee flows from these small black openings which are closest to the machine (see second image) and not from the bigger silwer ones.
Is that supposed to be that way?
Because it's really inconvenient because of the shape of the machine.
When I use a regular straight coffee mug (see picture 3, the one with the yellow handle), always one opening is over the edge of the mug, and the mug is already as close to the machine as possible, so that I have to tilt the mug so that no coffee is spilled. So I always have to use those white mugs that fit the shape of the machine.
IMO that's a massive design flaw for such quality machines.

2. I have to empty the water tray way too often. Usually after 2 to e coffees. And I have to add, that I always put a bowl on the machine to capture the water from the flushing cycles. But even still, I have to empty the tray two times a day while I drink around 4 to 5 coffees a day.
The coffee grounds also seem to be wet, which maybe is related.

1kf5gsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kf5gsu/boyfriend_isnt_very_thoughtful_and_its_making_me/,Boyfriend isn’t very thoughtful and it’s making me feel resentful/unloved. How can I ask him to be more thoughtful?,"My 26F boyfriend 28M and I have been together for 1.5 years. I love him very much. We are completely aligned in our worldviews, values, ideologies, interests, aspirations, lifestyles, intellect, senses of humor, desires, the works. I see a long term future with him, and we have discussed the idea of getting married down the line.

However, he is not a particularly thoughtful person. He’s kind, he’s communicative, he’s respectful, he’s trustworthy, he’s an excellent listener, he’s patient, he’s affectionate, but he doesn’t really go out of his way to make me feel special. I, on the other hand, am constantly thinking about him and coming up with surprises/small gestures to make him feel loved. I regularly pick up his favorite snacks at the grocery store, I get him flowers just because, if he’s running out of a hygiene item I notice and get him a new one, if he mentions he likes something I remember and surprise him with it later on, I regularly give him massages when he’s had a long day, I plan all kinds of different dates and activities for us, I cook him/us dinner, I surprise him with his favorite homemade desserts, I buy treats for his pets, I bring him back little things that made me think of him when I go on trips, I leave little love notes on his fridge or the bathroom mirror, when I’m at his apartment I will take out the trash/do dishes/laundry/etc if I notice it needs to be done (without being asked), I routinely pay for things for him just to be nice, I make or bring him coffee in the morning, I keep a list in my notes app of all the things he likes/gift ideas for him, I regularly compliment him and tell him everything I love about him in very specific detail, not just “I love you” but the specific physical, emotional, and intellectual things about him that I love.

Unfortunately, he doesn’t reciprocate this behavior. He has never been the one to plan a date for us. We cook together but he has never cooked for me before like I have for him. He has brought me flowers very occasionally for a birthday or anniversary, but never just because like I do for him. He has never given me a massage. He has never surprised me with a little gift just because he thought I would like it. He doesn’t bring home my favorite snacks from the store. He has never planned a surprise for me. He’s never done anything for my pets. He doesn’t write me love notes or cards. He tells me he loves me all the time, but never goes into detail about the specifics. He calls me beautiful occasionally, but I compliment him every day. One time he did the dishes for me while I was at work, and I told him how incredibly touched I was and how it made me feel so loved and meant so much to me. When his family does something nice for me/us, I hand write them a thank you note. When my family does something nice for him, I have to remind him to say thank you to them.

This imbalance of thoughtfulness is starting to hurt me and make me feel resentful. I don’t want our relationship to become transactional, but I feel like if he wanted to put the effort in he would. The little things matter to me, and they add up. I love him so much that I can’t help but think about him all the time, and it hurts me that the same isn’t true for him. About 6 months ago I was feeling the same way, and I cried and told him how I felt and that I wanted him to be more thoughtful. He was really receptive to the conversation and not defensive at all which was great, but in 6 months not a lot has changed. I feel like I need to talk to him again and ask for what I need, but I’m struggling to trust that he will make more of an effort. He regularly tells me that the things that I do “make him feel so loved” and that he wants to “get on my level and match my energy”, but behaviorally not much has changed. For context, I should probably mention that I have been in several serious relationships prior to this one, but I am his first serious relationship. I know he’s not as practiced with these things. But I also don’t think it’s that hard to learn or make an effort.

I also don’t want to sound ungrateful for the wonderful things he does do for me. He tells me he loves me every day, and I know that he does. I love that he texts me good morning every morning. I love that he’s not afraid to be affectionate with me in public. I love that he listens well and is patient and gentle with my emotions and anxiety. I love that he is very dependable and shows up for me when I need him. I am very appreciative of all the nice things he does do for me, but I also have somewhat come to expect them as bare minimum behavior in a serious, healthy, adult relationship. I’m wondering if I’m asking for too much, but at the same time, everything I want him to do for me are things that I am already doing for him. Any advice is welcome.

TL;DR I am much more thoughtful than my boyfriend when it comes to small gestures of love. The imbalance is starting to make me feel hurt and resentful. I’ve already asked him once for more, but not a lot changed. How can I get him to be more thoughtful without making him feel like a bad partner?",2,1746428918.0,relationships,5,1.0,False

Labor unions gathered in  the streets, raising placards and voices, demanding higher wages, better working conditions, and  the dignity they have long been denied. Some workers took the day to rest, collapsing into the kind of pause they rarely allow themselves. I did, too. 

Last night, I took a sleeping pill and, for once, didn’t set an alarm. I slept late and woke past eleven, groggy and heavy. My body felt like it had been carrying something for too long. Maybe it still is. I’m not sure if I’m sad. But something inside me feels off—something I can’t name or admit, even in silence. Am I grieving? Is this an existential crisis? I don’t know. Or maybe I do. Maybe I just don’t want to look at it too closely. 

You got married on April **. 

When I found out you were engaged, it stung—not in the way that made me want to call and plead or ask you to reconsider or stop you from making a lifelong decision, but the quiet, sinking kind  of way that made me stare at old ceilings and think about all the versions of yourself that used to exist. I thought of our past, our conversations, and our shared silences. And I accepted—again—that our story had ended long ago. We hadn’t spoken since we ended things. That was years ago, same month as your wedding, actually. I never tried to contact you. I don’t know your number anymore, I wouldn’t even know how to reach you, and honestly, for what reason? But there was this one conversation still sitting in my inbox. I never deleted it, it just lingers, collecting a kind of digital dust. 

On the day of your wedding, I used my spare phone—the one with a number only I know—and dialed an old, unsaved number from the conversation that sat quietly on my inbox all these years, untouched, unread, but never erased. I didn’t expect you to still be using that number let alone to actually answer it, especially on your wedding day. I know how hectic that day was. I’ve been to enough weddings myself, sometimes as a bridesmaid or an usherette, to know how chaotic everything gets. But surprisingly, it rang. And after just a few beeps, you picked up. 

I asked if it was you.
You said yes. 
I said congratulations. 
You said thank you. 
Then you asked, “Who is this?” 
And I ended the call. 

You didn’t recognize my voice. And really, why would you? We haven’t spoken in years. I didn’t expect you to remember. I didn’t plan to tell you who I was. I didn’t plan to contact you at all. Just that day. I thought I’d tucked it away after that. But the next day, I saw a missed call from that same number. Were you curious? Maybe. I ignored it. Then yesterday, you tried again. I didn’t pick up. It’s better this way. You not knowing is kinder to both of us. 

So that’s what’s been gnawing at me lately. I nearly spent the day curled in bed, doomscrolling, feeling like I was sinking through my own life. But if there’s one thing I learned about regulating my emotions is that when I start to feel overwhelmed, it’s crucial to seek out a soothing space to 
breathe or write things down. So, I got up, took a bath, and decided to go out to get my nails done at the salon near our apartment. But when I got there, it was closed. I ended up going to the mall instead and bought a box of blackening shampoo to dye my hair back to black. Then, I stayed at a 
coffee shop for a couple of hours, journaling and reading essays and random musings on Substack, an app I have discovered recently. It helped, even just a little, to be out in the world again. 

Scrolling through the app, I came across a line that said, “there’s a lot of intimacy in never speaking again.” It unsettled me how true it felt. When we ended things that night in April, that was it. No follow-ups. No almosts. No trying again. We never spoke again. Never saw each other again. And in some twisted way, that silence became its own kind of gift—a painful, silent gift. What I was 
left with were scraps. Random, useless details about you that have no place to go. They live somewhere deep in my mind, locked in a far-off room that feels haunted every time I accidentally open the door. We still have mutual friends online, so sometimes you appear in photos. And every 
time I see you, I’m struck by how much of a stranger you’ve become. As if the way we let go of each other quietly and completely somehow erased everything. Like our story didn’t happen. Like it left no mark. As if our love was erased cleanly, like chalk from a blackboard—no smudge, no 
trace. 

There’s something sacred about a silent goodbye. Something so cruelly tender in the fact that we both carry the same memories, yet I am the only one still holding them. And now I have to take everything—every bit of it—and put it inside a box. Bury it somewhere deep, far enough that I 
can't reach it anymore. Or maybe burn it, and watch it turn into ashes, into something unrecognizable. It’s so heavy that I have a hard time putting it into words. 

But as I wrote this, a part of me wanted to ask if you ever think of me, but I know I will never know the answer to that, and even entertaining the thought feels like a betrayal of everything I’ve promised myself since: to stay quiet, to stay gone, to honor the vow of nonexistence, and to keep 
the silence whole. 

I guess that was my Labor Day—letting myself rest, not just from work, but from pretending I’m unaffected. I let things surface, not to solve anything or make sense of what’s still tangled inside me, but just to simply notice it. I didn’t go to the rallies. I didn’t wave any banners. But in my own small, quiet way, I tried to reclaim a little piece of myself. I dyed my hair. I drank coffee alone. I wrote this. And somehow, that was enough. Maybe healing doesn’t always look like clarity. 
Sometimes it just looks like making it through the day without breaking the silence.",15,1746428847.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,0.94,False
1kf5g5q,https://i.redd.it/ae0vnjoixwye1.png,How to Read I Let His Mistress Win the Engagement Ring – Ready for a Story Where Walking Away Was the Real Power Move?,"# Just finished a story where walking away was the real victory? This one might be your next favorite empowerment read.

The day we were supposed to get our marriage license.

My boyfriend turned off the alarm and intentionally drove away, ensuring I’d miss the appointment. By the time I reached the registry office, I was greeted by the sight of his friend Miriam standing beside him, both dressed in matching white shirts, posing for the camera. Their closeness was evident, their smiles bright and carefree. Upon noticing me standing nearby, she had the nerve to blame me.

""It’s your fault for being late! We almost lost our spot!""

""Thankfully Miriam was here to help. We just took a little keepsake photo, you don’t mind, right?""

""Not at all.""

I laughed softly as I slipped off my engagement ring and handed it to his so-called friend. The ring, which had always been a bit loose on my fingers, fit hers perfectly. My smile grew.

""Wear the ring for the photo; it feels more genuine that way.""

Clayton's expression shifted immediately.

""Adaline, what are you doing?""

""Nothing much. I was up late working last night, feeling a bit worn out, so I'm heading home.""

I turned to leave, but Clayton caught my arm suddenly.

""Hold on, it’s almost our turn. Don’t worry, the photo with Miriam is just digital. Only ours will go on the documents.""

Miriam approached, her demeanor fake-friendly as she linked her arm with mine, her voice overly sweet.

""Oh, Addie, I’m so sorry.""

""I just thought it’d be a shame to end things right before the wedding, so I wanted a photo to remember it by. Had I known it’d cause a misunderstanding, I wouldn’t have come.""

""How about this? Once you two get your license, lunch is on me!""

She waved her ring-clad hand teasingly in my face.

I glanced at the two of them holding onto me, their matching shirts, identical rings, and even their unconscious synchronized movements indicating a long-standing familiarity.

""No thanks, you two enjoy yourselves.""

I shook them off and left amid the curious stares of the staff.

Miriam pouted charmingly, tugging at Clayton's sleeve.

""Clay, is Addie mad at me? I shouldn’t have come; it’s all my fault.""

Clayton’s expression darkened, and he dismissed her concerns.

""Miriam, it’s not your fault. If Adaline can’t appreciate what she has, that’s her problem. Forget her, let’s continue.""

After leaving, I hesitated for a moment before setting my phone to do not disturb. Then my stomach growled, so I found a place to eat.

Thinking back over the past five years, all our arguments leading to near breakups were because of Miriam. Barely an hour into our dates, Clayton would invariably be called away by her messages.

So when I saw them posing so affectionately for their photo, it felt like a weight lifted off my chest, and for the first time, I felt a profound sense of relief, a release from a stifling atmosphere.

After getting home, I washed up and fell into a deep sleep.

I slept soundly, with dreams where familiar voices called my name.

The next day, I woke naturally to find Clayton sitting at the table, sipping coffee. As soon as he saw me, he adopted a superior attitude.

""Adaline, what’s up with you? Waking up so late, my suit isn’t ironed, my tie isn’t ready. What am I supposed to wear to work?""

I looked at him perplexed.

""You can handle it yourself, can’t you? I didn’t plan on preparing anything for you.""

Clayton was furious.

He slammed his coffee down and hit the table, glaring at me.

""What’s your problem? Is it really worth it over something so trivial from yesterday?""

""I’m not upset at all.""

""I know you’re still mad about yesterday, but I only see Miriam as a friend. Of course, I’d help a friend in need. Look, next time we’ll get an afternoon appointment; surely you won’t oversleep then?""

""I’m not angry. If you want to help her, go right ahead. I have no problem with it.""

""Could you at least be nicer to Miriam? She...""

""There’s no need to explain further about you and Miriam; I get it. You’re like two peas in a pod. I’ve got things to do, so let’s drop this.""

I cut him off, grabbing my makeup bag and heading into the bathroom.

It was the first time I didn't want to hear him defend Miriam, and I faced him with indifference.

Clayton stood there, stunned, not even noticing as coffee stained his sleeve.",1,1746428834.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
1kf5g2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1kf5g2i/two_weeks_japan_cruise_some_lessons_learned/,"Two weeks Japan cruise, some lessons learned","Just got back from a 2 weeks cruise around Japan, some things I learned. 

**Sim:**  
I've not seen a single konbini sell physical sim cards. Bic Camera does but I decided to fork out a few euro more and just got one from a vending machine(softbank network). Worked just fine with no manual intervention needed. Wife had an esim on the NTT Docomo network and funnily, that worked further out on sea. When I'd lose connection she'd often have one or even two bars left. On land there was no discernable difference.

**Money**  
European debit card on the vpay system does not work in shops, but it does work on ATMs. A visa credit card works anywhere where they accept visa. Do watch out for the option to pay in euro versus yen. It's definitely more expensive.

When paying cash in shops be mindful of the money dish at the register, you're expected to use it.  Some shops now have a semi self service register, a staff member scans your purchases but you deposit cash in a little counting device. That may require you to press something on the screen that you finished paying. They're subtly different in every store. Also don't walk away before they've handed you the receipt.

**Getting around**  
Between the go app and an icoca card we  had no issues at all.  Finding information is a bit fragmented though. Every JR company has their own site it seems as do the major urban public transport companies. Google is pretty good though and rome2rio is also not bad. I found one taxi in rural sakaiminato that didn't take go for payment and preferred cash over card.

Do be aware that the go app setup cannot be finished until you're in japan and requires the ability to receive an SMS code. If your phone is single sim like mine you'll want to do it on a public wifi before swapping your sim. 

**Convenience store.**  
Yes, they're absolutely everywhere! Family mart has some decent emergency clothing basics including socks that even fit my huge feet. Unlike many here I'm not a fan of the highly processed unusual foods they offer. Their coffee is however generally quite drinkable and their bananas are, to my amazement, just as I like them. Sweet enough to eat, not the green monstrosities that you find in other countries.  Good place to get cash as well. 

**Drinks vending machines.**   
Actually less a thing in the bits of tokyo that I saw than elswehre in the country. Will sell you a 500ml bottle of nicely chilled water for anywhere between 120-150 yen and will have an assortment of soft drinks and bottled coffees as well.

**Language**  
Yes, very different that anything else I'm used to. Due to work I didn't study as much as I wanted but even a few dozen words of duolingo already make a difference. Google translate I used more on written text, it helps. A lot of young people in shops and restaurants seem to understand  a fair amount of english.

**Eating out**  
Breakfast. Konbini or a bakery. There's some really good bakeries around. Also love the speciality coffee places. OK you pay 700 for a coffee but it's a carefully roasted coffee made in a pour over. Loved it!  
Lunch: I really fell for the small canteen style restaurants. There was one in Osaka near our hotel there. Grab a tray, pick what you like, if it's cold you can ask if they'll make a fresh one or just heat it up in the microwave. Grab some chopsticks and a moist towel and enjoy. Chilled water is always included with the meal.  Drinks can be relatively expensive compared to the meal and apparently we men are not expected to drink alcohol free beer. If you carry your own tray you are expected to bring it back to the counter somewhere. If a place serves coffee or tea they will always want to know if you want it hot or cold.  
Go upmarket a bit and you'll likely be handed a laminated English menu and if nothing else works just point, hold up fingers for how many you like and throw in a  smile and a kudasai. If you order rice you may be asked the portion size and if you want plain rice or rice and beans (Osaka) or flavored rice (Aomori)  
There's some really good sake around for decent prices. Whisky is not that much cheaper there. I enjoyed the local craft beers as well, quite good.

**Trash cans.**   
There are generally none. So take it with you. We brought a roll of small trash bags just for that. I've seen recycling in a handful of places.

**Shopping**  
Big temptation. lots of shops. And unlike Shanghai where they seem to prefer chain stores in big shiny new malls this is a lot of quirky little places in arcades. Also the department store, which is dead or dying here in europe, is still very much a thing. We ended up buying an extra bag.

**Immigration**  
I feel I missed something. Yes I filled in everything on the visit japan website and got a QR code. Still have to do picture plus fingerprint at a kiosk and after that a border police person did the same thing again.  Main advantage of the website seems they don't have to decipher your handwriting on a tiny piece of paper?

  
All in all I enjoyed my trip. I really fel for the country.  Maybe even more for the smaller towns and the north of Honshu than the Tokyo/Osaka/Kobe/Kyoto urban sprawls. I can see myself go back, rent a car and explore north Honshu and Hokkaido.  Learn some Japanese and really go for it. 

The country felt safe and clean (coming back here to the netherlands at it all seems dirty and loud), the people quite hospitable and friendly and it feels like I've just gotten a first impression of this intriguing country.  Negative impression, behaviour of some of the Brazilian and Chinese tourists.",10,1746428823.0,JapanTravelTips,2,0.92,False
1kf5g18,https://i.redd.it/tu7y3hsixwye1.png,"Post Bobby's Burial, Eddie and Buck Find Some QT and A Blessing","After Bobby’s interment, Buck and Eddie had returned from the funeral reception and were now at Buck's place. A space now mutually shared for the time being.

The funeral had drained them both, the kind of exhaustion that sits behind your eyes and in your chest. Eddie had to catch a late flight back to Texas. Christopher was there, waiting. But for now, it was just the two of them.

They’d been quiet for a few minutes, lost in their own thoughts.

“You want a beer?” Buck asked.

Eddie nodded.

Buck handed it over with a soft glance. “You look tired, man. Go take a nap.”

Eddie gave a tired smile. “Thanks, Buck. I am. But I’ll take that beer first.”

He looked at Buck, who was fiddling with something on the coffee table.

“Hey—leave that alone,” Eddie said gently. “Come sit with me. It’s been a minute.”

Buck gave a short nod. “You’re right.” He sat beside him, close enough that their shoulders touched.

Eddie took a sip. “Missed you, Buckley.”

Buck glanced at him, warmth in his eyes. “How’s Christopher?”

But Eddie didn’t respond. His head had started to lean. Buck realized he’d fallen asleep. Quietly, Buck turned on the TV and set his beer down.

Eddie’s body slumped further, swaying into him. Without thinking, Buck shifted to catch him, guiding Eddie’s head to rest on his chest. Moments later, Buck closed his eyes, too. Eddie would miss his flight.

The room settled into a hush—just the steady rhythm of two men sleeping, wrapped in an atmosphere of comfort and quiet devotion.

The room had a soft orange hue of a setting sun beyond the Saint Gabriel Mountains. Flickers of light shimmered softly across the room, and a subtle scent of flowers bloomed into the private space. Eddie’s face began to glow—just faintly—as if someone had whispered a blessing across him. Buck, deeply asleep, didn’t stir.

Somewhere in the room, a faint clink echoed—like a glass raised in a toast. Then the TV turned off on its own.

Eddie’s eyes blinked for a moment and smiled - soft, sure, like he’d seen someone he loved. Then, just as easily, his eyes gently closed again.

A tri-folded program on the counter-top detailing Bobby Nash’s life drifted gently through the quiet space and came to rest on Buck’s arm—perfectly balanced, undisturbed like a resting bird finding its familiar perch. On its cover: A Celebration of Bobby Nash.

The living room space seemed to exhale. Time loosening its grip. Outside, now, the moon hovered behind a cloud, waiting.

The evening light dimmed towards near  darkness and shadows formed in the moonlight.

1kf5ent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1kf5ent/my_millennial_blue_collar_small_town_australian/,"My millennial, blue collar, small town, Australian childhood","I grew up a small-town, blue-collar millennial in Victoria, Australia. Growing up, I was interested in Australian Rules football (I supported Geelong), V8 Supercars (I supported Ford since they sponsored Geelong), and extreme sports, and mostly listened to metal music (nu metal from when I was 8-14; older metal when I was 14-17).

When I was about six, the things I'd make with Lego would be made up as I went along. But when an older cousin visited and I saw all the cool things he could make, I asked him, ""How does yours always turn out so good?"" ""I just thought of what I wanted to make, then made it"", he replied. This was a revelation to me, and a milestone in my development; it marked me starting to get the hang of 'planning ahead'. As a result, the next thing I made turned out a lot better, and I was elated. That night, after we went to bed, he taught me some inappropriate song.

When I was a bit older, I remember going to the beach with my older step-brother. We listened to Limp Bizkit on the way there (terrible band, I know, but it felt 'cool' to listen to 'explicit' music at that age), watched this Simpsons VHS with four episodes on it (back when The Simpsons was still good), watched Austin Powers (not a fan now, but at the time it felt 'adult'; my step-brother ended up saying quotes in his sleep), and played Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX on the PlayStation. I thought my step-brother was the coolest guy. He exposed me to so much music, and I'd copy how he dressed. He's schizophrenic now.

When I was a bit older than that, I visited a different, older, previously-dinosaur obsessed cousin a few towns over. He taught me more things than probably anyone, like how to kick a football properly (""Point your toe like a ballerina"", he said), spell fuck (I spelled it 'fak', and he said ""That's a bit like 'fake'""), use a cricket bat properly (""You're batting like a pro now"", he said afterwards), build bike jumps (we built a tabletop and a berm), and take apart and spray paint bikes. He also exposed me to a lot of music, like Blink-182 and 28 Days. We'd gotten to that age where we could ride our bikes around town unsupervised, so we rode into town, he put a Ecko cool shirt on lay-by, we did some other stuff, then went home. He then said ""You didn't think (town) was that big, did you?"", and I said ""No."" I felt so old and mature.

When I was a bit older than that, when riding my bike around town was still new and cool to me, I rode to a more affluent, green Holden Commodore SS-owning friend's house for the first time. He was one of those 'nice popular' kids. His house was kind of a 'McMansion', but I was spellbound nonetheless. I remember the first time I saw his bedroom: he showed me his expensive stereo, and we listened to Chop Suey! by System Of A Down; he had this cool jewelry box; he showed me this poster on the inside of his closet door that said 'Piss Off!', which I thought was so cheeky and cool, since I didn't really swear at home (""I didn't write it"", he joked); he showed me his brother's secret weed stash; we played this computer game where you beat up Osama bin Laden, back when knowing about 'cool' websites was like some cool secret knowledge; we stole a beer, had a sip each, and threw it down a hill; and went cruising in his 'paddock bomb', which in Australia is an old car you drive on private property and backroads.

And when I was a bit older than that, I won an Encouragement Award for playing football. I adored football, and practiced it constantly. But this was the first and only trophy I've ever won for playing it, so it became one of my most prized possessions; I remember how happy it made me. I broke it a few years later from kicking the football inside, and was devastated, but since it was only made of plastic, my mum took it to the trophy place and got it fixed.

After contracting a debilitating illness, I started escaping into even 'rougher' music, and have particularly good memories of late 2000s hip hop. I'd watch its music videos in my mum's house on an apple orchard; it's visual style makes me feel nostalgic. I also started browsing luxury lifestyle websites around this time, which also make me feel nostalgic; they made me realize how big the world was.

Because of my illness, the best memories of my adult life have been things like waking up early, experiencing that feeling of nobody else being up, drinking black coffee, browsing my favorite subreddit, and having the light gradually come through the window on a mild morning, or watching Rage, an Australian music video show, on a Saturday morning, while being reminded of the 2000s, especially Will Smith and Men in Black II for some reason (maybe his music video for the Men in Black II music video came on, or maybe the 2000s special effects of another music video reminded me of him and Men in Black II), then walking down the street to buy cookies when a song I didn't like came on, and at the end, feeling like the morning had been well spent.

I have better taste in things now, but I still smile whenever those memories come back to me.",2,1746428658.0,Millennials,1,1.0,False

Mondays... We've All Been There! 😴  
Ah, Monday. That familiar feeling of the weekend slipping away and the weight of the week looming. We get it! It's okay to feel a little draggy after a good weekend.  
But here's the thing: you've got this! 💪 You just spent a couple of days doing things you love, recharging your batteries, and filling your cup. Tap into that positive energy!  
Think of it like this: the weekend was like a supercharged battery pack for your soul. Now, let's use that power to tackle the week! 🚀  
Here are a few tips to get you started:  
\* Start small: Don't try to conquer the whole week at once. Break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.  
\* Reward yourself: Plan a small reward for getting through the day. It could be anything from a cup of coffee to a few minutes of meditation.  
\* Remember your weekend wins: Take a moment to reflect on the positive experiences you had over the weekend. Let those good vibes fuel your Monday.  
You've got this! Let's make this Monday a productive and awesome one. ✨",1,1746428517.0,3AMALONE,0,1.0,False

After running three full marathons last year—Canberra, Sydney, and Singapore—I decided it was time to take a break in 2025 to focus on the less time-intensive distances. The good news was that I had an decent base to start from, so I continued on my self coaching journey.

I decided to sign up for the Hoka Runaway™ Sydney Half Marathon as I hadn't run the course since 2022, when it was still known as the Sydney Morning Herald Half Marathon. I had run my half marathon PR of 88:30 last year at Gold Coast, known for being a very flat course. The Sydney HM is known for being quite a hilly course, so I was mainly hoping to at least match my previous PR.

I followed a very similar structure to my full marathon training, but this time with less mileage in general. I'd cap out the weekend long run at roughly two hours, and the midweek long run was roughly 90 minutes. Having based my marathon plan on Pfitz, these long runs also ended pretty quickly. Given the reduced weekly mileage, I wondered if I was giving myself enough easy miles in the week.

Tuesday sessions were mostly threshold intervals, gradually being replaced by VO2 max intervals towards the end. I tried implementing a short tempo run on Fridays (as I previously only did 1 hard workout a week, but I'm not sure if this should've been replaced with longer threshold intervals.

I decided to throw in a 5k time trial at a local parkrun four weeks before the race and and managed to get 19:17. Despite the non-ideal conditions, the result was slightly concerning and was a wake-up call to immediately start implementing higher paced intervals (hence my mention of VO2 max intervals above).

With two weeks to go, I did a high-effort long run along parts of the City2Surf route, another infamously hilly Sydney race. It went reasonably well, but more high-effort hill work in the build-up would've been ideal. The weekend after had a sort of dress rehearsal (i.e. testing race-day shoes at race pace) on Saturday and a ""regular"" long run on Sunday before I began my 1-week taper.

### Pre-race
Given it was ""just"" a half marathon, no proper carb loading was done apart from eating a bunch of chocolate and chugging some Powerade the day before. Ramen for lunch, teriyaki beef bowl for dinner. I headed to bed early, but ended up lying awake for a bit as I hadn't attempted to shift my body clock over the preceding nights.

Woke up an hour before my 05:00 alarm and couldn't go back to sleep, not ideal but nothing that would derail the race. Had my usual breakfast of coffee with oats and blueberries, which somehow always helps me clear my bowels in the morning. With quite some time to spare, I then squeezed in a cheeky session of Monster Hunter Wilds!

Heading out the door at 06:00, I started my warm-up jog towards Circular Quay. After doing my dynamic stretches, drills, and strides, I once again found myself at the start line of another race. Making my way through the red start group, I placed myself between the 85-minute and 90-minute pacers. It was slightly chilly, but being huddled together with other runners made it surprisingly comfortable. I took my first gel and awaited the starting gun.

### Race
Having run this event before, one thing I love is how they bottleneck the start. I was pleasantly surprised to find the bottlenecking this year was the tightest I've ever seen—seemingly just only 2m wide! Sure it sucks if you're aiming for gun time, but the starting kilometer becomes way more enjoyable.

Making it past the starting arch, I find myself barrelling down the Cahill Expressway with Circular Quay and the Harbour Bridge to my right. Having studied the course, I knew the first 8km would be quite undulating and was prepared to run by effort. Some of the downhill sections were unfortunately too steep to speed up on, so time had to be lost for personal safety.

I made it to the Pyrmont boardwalk slightly over half an hour into the run, marking the start of the flat section of the course which would last for about 7km. I took my second gel and gradually picked up the pace and tried to hold about 380W of running power. I saw that my heart rate was holding steady at the mid-170s, so I took it as a good sign. Unfortunately, I also felt the beginnings of a blister on my left arch.

It wasn't long before I got to the 15km flag, meaning I would soon begin the next undulating section of the course that would last all the way until the finish line. I then began the arduous climb from Walsh Bay to Argyle Street and further up to Observatory Hill. Composing myself as I came out of the Cahill Expressway spiral and with 4km to go, I decided it would be now or never to empty the tank—easier said than done.

At last section on Mrs Macquaries Road was undoubtedly the worst part of the course and had been that way for many years. I pushed as though I was racing a parkrun, seeing some friends along the way who were cheering me on. I may have put too much effort into the final steep hill near the Art Gallery of NSW, but I kept pushing until I finally crossed the finish line.

### Post-race
I had beaten my half marathon PR by half a minute on a much hillier course, and my own course record from 2022 by slightly over 11 minutes! With the Gold Coast half marathon lined up in July, I aim to achieve sub-86 (i.e. 4:04/km avg pace) by then.

I feel as though I could've gone harder from the halfway point and possibly achieved close to 87:30. That said, I'm definitely proud of the timing I achieved yesterday. Gold Coast will be flat enough that I don't have to plan out pacing for specific sections of the course, so that should allow me to funnel all my in-race energy towards maintaining that 4:04/km pace.

As I take the coming week to recover, I will be going through Brad Hudson's training book once more to see if my training plan can be better optimised for the seven remaining weeks. I already have two 5k time trials penciled in, and I will plan more workouts with race pace built in.

Here's to a successful training block, and I'll see everyone again for another race report in July!

I want to visit some big corporate parks and buildings but I am not sure if they accept visitors and I think they close at 5PM. Can yall suggest some good places or corporate facilities to explore which are open after 5 PM and if possible can yall also mention a good way of transit, because I don’t want to get stuck in traffic or pay hefty parking fees.

Growing up, I was interested in Australian Rules football (I supported Geelong), V8 Supercars (I supported Ford since they sponsored Geelong), and extreme sports, and mostly listened to metal music (nu metal from when I was 8-14; older metal when I was 14-17).

When I was about six, the things I'd make with Lego would be made up as I went along. But when an older cousin visited and I saw all the cool things he could make, I asked him, ""How does yours always turn out so good?"" ""I just thought of what I wanted to make, then made it"", he replied. This was a revelation to me, and a milestone in my development; it marked me starting to get the hang of 'planning ahead'. As a result, the next thing I made turned out a lot better, and I was elated. That night, after we went to bed, he taught me some inappropriate song.

When I was a bit older, I remember going to the beach with my older step-brother. We listened to Limp Bizkit on the way there (terrible band, I know, but it felt 'cool' to listen to 'explicit' music at that age), watched this Simpsons VHS with four episodes on it (back when The Simpsons was still good), watched Austin Powers (not a fan now, but at the time it felt 'adult'; my step-brother ended up saying quotes in his sleep), and played Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX on the PlayStation. I thought my step-brother was the coolest guy. He exposed me to so much music, and I'd copy how he dressed. He's schizophrenic now.

When I was a bit older than that, I visited a different, older, previously-dinosaur obsessed cousin a few towns over. He taught me more things than probably anyone, like how to kick a football properly (""Point your toe like a ballerina"", he said), spell fuck (I spelled it 'fak', and he said ""That's a bit like 'fake'""), use a cricket bat properly (""You're batting like a pro now"", he said afterwards), build bike jumps (we built a tabletop and a berm), and take apart and spray paint bikes. He also exposed me to a lot of music, like Blink-182 and 28 Days. We'd gotten to that age where we could ride our bikes around town unsupervised, so we rode into town, he put a Ecko cool shirt on lay-by, we did some other stuff, then went home. He then said ""You didn't think (town) was that big, did you?"", and I said ""No."" I felt so old and mature.

When I was a bit older than that, when riding my bike around town was still new and cool to me, I rode to a more affluent, green Holden Commodore SS-owning friend's house for the first time. He was one of those 'nice popular' kids. His house was kind of a 'McMansion', but I was spellbound nonetheless. I remember the first time I saw his bedroom: he showed me his expensive stereo, and we listened to Chop Suey! by System Of A Down; he had this cool jewelry box; he showed me this poster on the inside of his closet door that said 'Piss Off!', which I thought was so cheeky and cool, since I didn't really swear at home (""I didn't write it"", he joked); he showed me his brother's secret weed stash; we played this computer game where you beat up Osama bin Laden, back when knowing about 'cool' websites was like some cool secret knowledge; we stole a beer, had a sip each, and threw it down a hill; and went cruising in his 'paddock bomb', which in Australia is an old car you drive on private property and backroads.

And when I was a bit older than that, I won an Encouragement Award for playing football. I adored football, and practiced it constantly. But this was the first and only trophy I've ever won for playing it, so it became one of my most prized possessions; I remember how happy it made me.

I also started browsing luxury lifestyle websites around this time, which also make me feel nostalgic; they made me realize how big the world was.

Because of my illness, the best memories of my adult life have been things like waking up early, experiencing that feeling of nobody else being up, drinking black coffee, browsing my favorite subreddit, and having the light gradually come through the window on a mild morning, or watching Rage, an Australian music video show, on a Saturday morning, while being reminded of the 2000s, especially Will Smith and Men in Black II for some reason (maybe his music video for the Men in Black II music video came on, or maybe the 2000s special effects of another music video reminded me of him and Men in Black II), then walking down the street to buy cookies when a song I didn't like came on, and at the end, feeling like the morning had been well spent.

""I just thought of what I wanted to make, then made it"", he replied. This was a revelation to me, and a milestone in my development; it marked me starting to get the hang of 'planning ahead'. As a result, the next thing I made turned out a lot better, and I was elated. That night, after we went to bed, he taught me some inappropriate song.

When I was a bit older, I remember going to the beach with my older step-brother. We listened to Limp Bizkit on the way there (terrible band, I know, but it felt 'cool' to listen to 'explicit' music at that age), watched this Simpsons VHS with four episodes on it (back when The Simpsons was still good), watched Austin Powers (not a fan now, but at the time it felt 'adult'; my step-brother ended up saying quotes in his sleep), and played Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX on the PlayStation. I thought my step-brother was the coolest guy. He exposed me to so much music, and I'd copy how he dressed. He's schizophrenic now.

When I was a bit older than that, I visited a different, older, previously-dinosaur obsessed cousin a few towns over. He taught me more things than probably anyone, like how to kick a football properly (""Point your toe like a ballerina"", he said), spell fuck (I spelled it 'fak', and he said ""That's a bit like 'fake'""), use a cricket bat properly (""You're batting like a pro now"", he said afterwards), build bike jumps (we built a tabletop and a berm), and take apart and spray paint bikes. He also exposed me to a lot of music, like Blink-182 and 28 Days. We'd gotten to that age where we could ride our bikes around town unsupervised, so we rode into town, he put a Ecko cool shirt on lay-by, we did some other stuff, then went home. He then said ""You didn't think (town) was that big, did you?"", and I said ""No."" I felt so old and mature.

When I was a bit older than that, when riding my bike around town was still new and cool to me, I rode to a more affluent, green Holden Commodore SS-owning friend's house for the first time. He was one of those 'nice popular' kids. His house was kind of a 'McMansion', but I was spellbound nonetheless. I remember the first time I saw his bedroom: he showed me his expensive stereo, and we listened to Chop Suey! by System Of A Down; he had this cool jewelry box; he showed me this poster on the inside of his closet door that said 'Piss Off!', which I thought was so cheeky and cool, since I didn't really swear at home (""I didn't write it"", he joked); he showed me his brother's secret weed stash; we played this computer game where you beat up Osama bin Laden, back when knowing about 'cool' websites was like some cool secret knowledge; we stole a beer, had a sip each, and threw it down a hill; and went cruising in his 'paddock bomb', which in Australia is an old car you drive on private property and backroads.

And when I was a bit older than that, I won an Encouragement Award for playing football. I adored football, and practiced it constantly. But this was the first and only trophy I've ever won for playing it, so it became one of my most prized possessions; I remember how happy it made me. I broke it a few years later from kicking the football inside, and was devastated, but since it was only made of plastic, my mum took it to the trophy place and got it fixed.

After contracting a debilitating illness, I started escaping into even 'rougher' music, and have particularly good memories of late 2000s hip hop. I'd watch its music videos in my mum's house on an apple orchard; it's visual style makes me feel nostalgic. I also started browsing luxury lifestyle websites around this time, which also make me feel nostalgic; they made me realize how big the world was.

Because of my illness, the best memories of my adult life have been things like waking up early, experiencing that feeling of nobody else being up, drinking black coffee, browsing my favorite subreddit, and having the light gradually come through the window on a mild morning, or watching Rage, an Australian music video show, on a Saturday morning, while being reminded of the 2000s, especially Will Smith and Men in Black II for some reason (maybe his music video for the Men in Black II music video came on, or maybe the 2000s special effects of another music video reminded me of him and Men in Black II), then walking down the street to buy cookies when a song I didn't like came on, and at the end, feeling like the morning had been well spent.

Which do you think would be the best : I am an international MSc student. I don't really like going out but I do want to make friends to go on coffee dates, study dates, cook together, etc. So I definitely don't want a hall where everyone wants to go out drinking all the time. I would go home every weekend because I am very close to my family and my boyfriend is in my hometown. I like having my comfort so would be a plus to have my own bathroom. Also, can I have sometimes friends staying at my place to visit ?

Are there any people with the same vibe as me at LSE ? I am quite worried I would not make any friends as I don't like going out.

1kf55ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1kf55ti/aita_for_wanting_more_from_my_man/,AITA for wanting more from my man,"I (28F) have been in a relationship with my partner (35M) for 9 months now. Here’s some backstory: He is my first ever boyfriend. I didn’t date in college because I wanted to focus on school, and I have conservative parents. After college, I still didn’t entertain suitors because I was focused on my career.

Right now, I have a stable job with a good salary, and I can say I was living comfortably as a single woman. Last year, I joined a dating app and met him. We clicked right away—I found him intelligent and overall a wonderful guy.

A little background about him: Around 8 years ago, he was a successful businessman, owning 8 branches of his business in our city. But everything fell apart when COVID hit, and he had to shut it all down. He had only had one girlfriend before, which lasted 3 years, but they separated because she moved to another country. After his business closed, he became depressed, was diagnosed with a health condition, and his overall well-being declined.

Around 2022, he started turning his life around. He focused on getting healthy and fit, and he returned to his original career in IT, where he’s currently working part-time.

Now, back to the main story—and when the seeds of discomfort and doubt started.

Early in our relationship, he had some financial struggles. He needed to pay a tax in order to obtain a government document (we’re not living in the U.S.). At first, he asked for help with a small amount. I agreed—I had the means and wanted to support him. The next month, he was still short on cash. He explained it would take four months to resolve his financial liabilities, and again, I agreed to help.

To give you some context about me: I grew up in a middle-class family. We weren’t poor, but we weren’t rich either. My parents always provided our needs, but rarely our wants. That’s why money means a lot to me, and why I’ve worked hard to get where I am.

The second time I helped him, then came a third—he asked if I could help pay for groceries. Now, he’s committed to a healthy lifestyle, so the food he eats is high-quality and expensive. I also eat healthy, but this was way beyond my usual grocery budget. He said it was okay since we’d share the food. So I agreed. We did share the food—but it was more like 20% for me, 80% for him. This went on for another two months.

I know I should have said something earlier, but during the times we weren’t talking about money, he was incredibly sweet. He told me everything I needed to hear, adored me, and I truly believe he is 100% loyal.

He also told me that once he was financially stable again, he would start treating me better. I held onto that hope.

Fast forward to this year—he’s now free of his tax issues and in a better place than he was. He doesn’t ask for much anymore. But here’s where the problem starts: he’s not giving me anything either. No flowers, no chocolates, no dinner dates (because he insists on cooking, saying it’s healthier—and when he cooks, I pay for the groceries).

Every time we go out—beach, hiking, whatever—I end up paying for both of us. I’m not high maintenance, but I do expect my partner to spend something on me. At this point, it feels like I’m his sugar mommy—and I definitely didn’t sign up for that.

I love him. I really do. But this issue is weighing heavily on me. He reassures me with words, gives me his time, and we’re very compatible sexually. But financially, I feel unappreciated. And when I try to talk about it, I get emotional and end up saying the wrong things. I’m not good with words when I’m upset.

Just last week, we had another fight. He came over, I bought the groceries, and he cooked. I had already told him before that I don’t like spicy food—yet he made the dish spicy anyway. We fought over it. Then he asked me to make him a fruit bowl for dinner. I said, “Why? Shouldn’t you make it for me instead? Or at least make it yourself, since I paid for it?”

In my defense, we had an agreement: his contribution in the relationship is cooking. But now he’s starting to boss me around. The way he asked sounded more like an order, like I’m at his beck and call. I snapped again. I said, “I provided everything today—the least you could do is pamper me.”

Things escalated from there. I usually talk to him when I buy stuff and during this argument I said something about me not having to tell him every time I buy something because it’s my money anyway not OUR money. He got hurt by that. I shut him down and told him I didn’t want to talk and needed space. 

Honestly, I’m not sure about this relationship anymore. I find myself keeping track of what I’ve done for him versus what he’s done for me, and I know that’s not healthy. He once told me that if I ever need something, he’ll do everything he can to help me. That in the future when he is financially stable (he has plans on starting his business again), he’ll give me what I deserve. 

But the truth is, I rarely ask him for help—especially when it involves money—because I feel like if he can’t even buy me a coffee without me asking, how can I trust that he’ll help when I really need a favor?

At this point, I don’t know how to move forward in this relationship. Should I trust that he’ll treat me better (like spend money on me) or should I prioritize myself? I really really do love him and I want him to be my first and last but I also know I deserve someone who will take me out on expensive dates, buy me books, surprise me with a gift. I hear other girls gushing over their men showering them with gifts, and I hate how I can’t stop comparing myself to them. 

Am I too materialistic? Selfish? I don’t know.

My opinion is that I really don't want to be in the middle of this.If he wants to have a relationship with my mom it's his choice and my mom's call.Why bother me?Apart from that I personally feel weird and awkward given it is my AP and my mom being the people in talk here.Also his ex-wife is an AP in another department and I would be in the bad side of her just incase if he involves with my mom.I understand that he is divorced,lonely and want some female company(hence the desperation in his attempts).But isn't it unprofessional and unethical on his side?

My boyfriend turned off the alarm and intentionally drove away, ensuring I’d miss the appointment. By the time I reached the registry office, I was greeted by the sight of his friend Miriam standing beside him, both dressed in matching white shirts, posing for the camera. Their closeness was evident, their smiles bright and carefree. Upon noticing me standing nearby, she had the nerve to blame me.

""It’s your fault for being late! We almost lost our spot!""

""Thankfully Miriam was here to help. We just took a little keepsake photo, you don’t mind, right?""

""Not at all.""

I laughed softly as I slipped off my engagement ring and handed it to his so-called friend. The ring, which had always been a bit loose on my fingers, fit hers perfectly. My smile grew.

""Wear the ring for the photo; it feels more genuine that way.""

Clayton's expression shifted immediately.

""Adaline, what are you doing?""

""Nothing much. I was up late working last night, feeling a bit worn out, so I'm heading home.""

I turned to leave, but Clayton caught my arm suddenly.

""Hold on, it’s almost our turn. Don’t worry, the photo with Miriam is just digital. Only ours will go on the documents.""

Miriam approached, her demeanor fake-friendly as she linked her arm with mine, her voice overly sweet.

""Oh, Addie, I’m so sorry.""

""I just thought it’d be a shame to end things right before the wedding, so I wanted a photo to remember it by. Had I known it’d cause a misunderstanding, I wouldn’t have come.""

""How about this? Once you two get your license, lunch is on me!""

She waved her ring-clad hand teasingly in my face.

I glanced at the two of them holding onto me, their matching shirts, identical rings, and even their unconscious synchronized movements indicating a long-standing familiarity.

""No thanks, you two enjoy yourselves.""

I shook them off and left amid the curious stares of the staff.

Miriam pouted charmingly, tugging at Clayton's sleeve.

""Clay, is Addie mad at me? I shouldn’t have come; it’s all my fault.""

Clayton’s expression darkened, and he dismissed her concerns.

""Miriam, it’s not your fault. If Adaline can’t appreciate what she has, that’s her problem. Forget her, let’s continue.""

After leaving, I hesitated for a moment before setting my phone to do not disturb. Then my stomach growled, so I found a place to eat.

Thinking back over the past five years, all our arguments leading to near breakups were because of Miriam. Barely an hour into our dates, Clayton would invariably be called away by her messages.

So when I saw them posing so affectionately for their photo, it felt like a weight lifted off my chest, and for the first time, I felt a profound sense of relief, a release from a stifling atmosphere.

After getting home, I washed up and fell into a deep sleep.

I slept soundly, with dreams where familiar voices called my name.

The next day, I woke naturally to find Clayton sitting at the table, sipping coffee. As soon as he saw me, he adopted a superior attitude.

""Adaline, what’s up with you? Waking up so late, my suit isn’t ironed, my tie isn’t ready. What am I supposed to wear to work?""

I looked at him perplexed.

""You can handle it yourself, can’t you? I didn’t plan on preparing anything for you.""

Clayton was furious.

He slammed his coffee down and hit the table, glaring at me.

""What’s your problem? Is it really worth it over something so trivial from yesterday?""

## Key Features Analysis

The following sausage brands have been selected for their reputation, availability, and product offerings in the case format. Key features such as meat source, seasoning, casing type, and processing methods have been carefully analyzed.

**Meat Source and Quality**

The quality of the meat used is paramount in determining the overall taste and texture of the sausage. Brands that prioritize ethically sourced, high-quality cuts tend to produce superior products. Some brands use specific breeds of pigs known for their flavorful meat, while others focus on lean-to-fat ratios to achieve a desired consistency. The source of the meat, whether it's locally farmed or imported, can also influence the freshness and environmental impact of the sausage.

**Seasoning and Flavor Profile**

Sausage seasoning is a delicate art, balancing spices and herbs to create a distinctive flavor profile. Different brands employ unique spice blends, ranging from traditional Italian seasonings like fennel and anise to spicy chorizo blends with chili peppers and paprika. The intensity of the seasoning, whether mild, medium, or hot, caters to diverse palates. Some brands also experiment with unconventional flavor combinations, incorporating ingredients like maple syrup, apples, or even coffee.

**Casing Type**

The casing, the outer layer that holds the sausage meat together, plays a crucial role in the sausage's texture and cooking properties. Natural casings, typically made from animal intestines, offer a characteristic ""snap"" when bitten into and are often preferred for grilling or frying. Collagen casings, made from processed animal collagen, are more uniform in size and shape, making them suitable for mass production. Plant-based casings are also gaining popularity, offering a vegetarian or vegan alternative.

**Processing and Production Methods**

The way sausage is processed and produced can significantly impact its quality and shelf life. Fresh sausage, which is uncooked and requires refrigeration, offers the most authentic flavor but has a shorter shelf life. Smoked sausage undergoes a smoking process that imparts a smoky flavor and extends its shelf life. Cooked sausage is pre-cooked and ready to eat, providing convenience but potentially sacrificing some flavor. Brands that prioritize traditional methods, such as hand-linking and small-batch production, often produce superior sausages.

Key features for evaluating a case of sausage include:

*   Meat source transparency
*   Variety of flavor profiles
*   Casing options (natural, collagen, plant-based)
*   Processing methods (fresh, smoked, cooked)

## Core Benefits

Purchasing a case of sausage offers several distinct advantages for consumers who regularly enjoy this versatile food. These benefits range from cost savings and convenience to the ability to experiment with different recipes and flavor combinations.

**Cost Savings and Bulk Purchasing**

Buying sausage in bulk, specifically a case, typically translates to significant cost savings compared to purchasing smaller quantities. Wholesale pricing structures often offer lower per-pound costs, making it an economically sound choice for frequent sausage consumers. This bulk purchasing power allows individuals and families to stock up on their favorite sausages without breaking the bank.

**Convenience and Meal Planning**

Having a case of sausage on hand provides unparalleled convenience for meal planning and preparation. Sausages can be incorporated into a wide array of dishes, from breakfast items like omelets and breakfast burritos to lunch and dinner entrees like pasta sauces, stews, and grilled skewers. The availability of a readily accessible supply of sausage simplifies meal preparation and reduces the need for frequent grocery store trips.

**Versatility and Recipe Experimentation**

A case of sausage opens up a world of culinary possibilities, encouraging experimentation with different recipes and flavor combinations. With a variety of sausage types available, from mild Italian to spicy chorizo, consumers can explore diverse cuisines and create unique dishes tailored to their individual tastes. This versatility makes sausage a valuable ingredient for both novice cooks and seasoned chefs.

**Extended Shelf Life and Storage**

Many sausage products, especially smoked or cured varieties, boast a relatively long shelf life when properly stored. Vacuum-sealed packaging and refrigeration or freezing techniques can further extend the freshness of the sausage, allowing consumers to enjoy their bulk purchase over an extended period without compromising quality. This extended shelf life minimizes food waste and maximizes the value of the investment.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions regarding purchasing and storing a case of sausage is crucial for ensuring satisfaction and maximizing the value of the investment.

**What is the typical shelf life of a case of sausage?**

The shelf life of a case of sausage varies depending on the type of sausage and the storage method. Fresh sausage typically lasts for 1-2 days in the refrigerator, while smoked or cured sausage can last for several weeks. Freezing sausage can extend its shelf life for several months. Always check the ""use-by"" or ""sell-by"" date on the packaging and follow the manufacturer's recommendations for storage.

**How should I store a case of sausage to maximize its freshness?**

To maximize the freshness of a case of sausage, it is essential to store it properly. Fresh sausage should be refrigerated immediately and consumed within a few days. Smoked or cured sausage can be stored in the refrigerator for a longer period. For extended storage, freezing is recommended. Wrap the sausage tightly in freezer-safe packaging to prevent freezer burn and maintain its quality.

**Can I freeze a case of sausage?**

Yes, freezing is an excellent way to preserve a case of sausage for future use. To freeze sausage effectively, divide it into smaller portions that are convenient for meal preparation. Wrap each portion tightly in freezer-safe plastic wrap or place it in a freezer bag, removing as much air as possible. Label the packaging with the date and contents. Frozen sausage can typically be stored for several months without significant loss of quality.

**What are the different types of sausage typically found in a case?**

A case of sausage may contain a single type of sausage or a variety of different types, depending on the brand and product offering. Common types of sausage found in cases include Italian sausage (mild or hot), breakfast sausage, chorizo, bratwurst, and kielbasa. Some brands also offer specialty sausages with unique flavor combinations or regional variations.
