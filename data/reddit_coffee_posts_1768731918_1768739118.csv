Scott Watson was slumped at one desk out of six in the office that the visiting astronomers shared, several books as thick as his arm scattered open across the desk, interspersed with a sea of papers annotated with scribbles and equations, and three separate coffee mugs. On one side of the office, the blinds just barely let the golden sunlight into the room. On the other, a giant blackboard loomed large, every surface covered in diagrams and equations. Someone had drawn an alien poised as though writing one of the particularly gnarly differential equations.  
  
As Scott stared idly at his screen, looking at a simulation tick by without really watching it, he was brought back to Earth by a knock on the door. It was George Boyle, the lead astronomer of the Lowell Observatory, a corpulent man in his late fifties. ""Hey! New guy…uh…what's your name again?"" he said. ""We're getting a couple of drinks at the bar in town before we go up to the observatory. Wanna come? The IPA is to die for. Hell, it's almost worth the twenty dollars a drink."" He chuckled at the last bit.  
  
Scott tore his eyes away from the screen, stifling a yawn. ""Yeah, sure. Let me just wrap up a few things,"" he said, terminating the simulation and closing about a dozen ArXiv tabs in rapid succession and sipping his can of beer.  
  
""Alright then. We'll wait outside,"" said Boyle. He took a couple of steps further into the room, glancing into a corner ""…Oh! What about you, Lauren? Coming?""  
  
A woman in her mid-twenties, wearing a hoodie, with long dark hair framing her face, glanced at Boyle. ""It's fine. I actually found something really interesting to look at. I'll meet you guys at the observatory tonight,"" she said, then immediately went back to her work.  
  
""Great! See you there,"" said Boyle, giving her a thumbs-up before heading out, leaving the door slightly ajar behind him.  
  
Scott finished closing his tabs and shut off the computer. Just as he was getting up to leave, he grabbed one of the papers on his desk and stood there skimming the conclusion, or at least trying to–the information stayed in his mind like water in a sieve. He sighed heavily and looked over at the woman in the corner. For some reason, his gaze seemed drawn to that part of the room. ""You found something?"" he asked.  
  
""Mmhmm,"" said Lauren, not looking up from her screen.  
  
Scott flashed her a smile. ""Lucky you, I've got nothing.""  
  
""Don't worry about it. We've only been here a week.""  
  
""Which means only eleven weeks left. So…can I ask what you found?""  
  
Lauren gave him an appraising look, then pulled out the chair next to her and said, ""Sit."" He did so, looking at her screen, where a squiggly time series curve was displayed. ""I was looking at this data from a broad night-sky sweep for thermal emissions from Hot Jupiters and I found this,"" she said, tapping on the time series with a pen, ""a faint IR emission, at the limits of our best detectors. I thought it was a glitch, but it was there for hours last night, until it went below the horizon."" She paused, leaning close to the screen, absently wrapping a lock of hair around one finger. Scott forcefully tore his eyes away from her face to look at the chart. ""No. I lied. When I did some basic signal processing, I found that there were two, with intensity curves on the same order of magnitude, roughly a few milliarcseconds apart,"" Lauren went on.  
  
""Er…is this a common phenomenon?"" asked Scott.  
  
""No,"" said Lauren flatly, ""And they're also emitting X-rays.""  
  
""Forgive me,"" said Scott, ""I'm just a humble comparative planetologist, so I had to ask.""  
  
""I know. I read a couple of your papers,"" said Lauren with a half-smile.  
  
""What? Why? Uh…I mean, thank you. Uh…I mean…"" Scott trailed off into silence, his brain running full throttle for something intelligent to say. He settled for draining his beer can.  
  
""I was bored."" She sighed, turning to face Scott full on for the first time. ""Do you know how many papers do nothing but tweak one parameter in some theoretical model with no evidence?""  
  
""I don't think mine are that different,"" admitted Scott, ""It's a numbers game. There's never any time for pie-in-the-sky dream projects. Nor funding these days.""  
  
""But you do have a pie-in-the-sky dream project in mind, right? Something you'd do if only the powers that be would let you? You seem like the type."" Lauren leaned forward intently.  
  
""Uh…."" Scott trailed off, ""I guess something to do with Mars' Hesperian period. Modeling how the place froze over. But for now I'm just a guy who looks at dust storms.""  
  
Lauren nodded. ""Ambitious. I like it.""  
  
""Do you have one?""  
  
""I'd love to find a primordial black hole someday. I learned about them when I was eight. Always thought the idea was beautiful. Just these motes of dust as heavy as asteroids hiding throughout space like a trillion trillion ghosts.,"" said Lauren, her voice hushed and her dark eyes seeming to stare straight into Scott's soul. ""But nah. My real pet project is whatever my advisor has funding for. Which is determining the atmospheric temperature of Hot Jupiters to three significant figures."" She sighed.  
  
Scott's phone buzzed, jolting him out of the moment. It was a text from Luke: *Hey Dad, I saw this TikTok and it kinda reminded me that we never really talked about whatever Mom said to you before she died. You said you'd tell me when I'm older, remember?*  
  
""Uh…uh…"" muttered Scott out loud, looking around the room for anything to find mental purchase on. ""Is this related to the black hole thing?"" Scott gestured at the screen.  
  
""Maybe. It could be from interstellar dust or gas interacting with a primordial black hole. I want to look more tonight, that's why I had to take care of some other stuff before we go."" Lauren's voice was placid, her gaze fixed intently on the screen as though unaware of the trainwreck in Scott's head.  
  
""Oh, I thought it's because we only have three months here and you're desperate to make every day count,"" said Scott. He sent a text back to Luke: *Jesus Christ that came out of the left field.*  
  
""That too."" Lauren laughed.  
  
""Or were you hoping to stay?""  
  
""Nah, I'm going back to UC Berkeley to finish my PhD.""  
  
""UC Berkeley? So you're really a rising star!""  
  
""Maybe a red dwarf. Just one of billions burning softly in the background for a long time.""  
  
""Or maybe an O-type star. The brightest and hottest,"" said Scott, ""and the ones that make their mark on the whole galaxy before long.""  
  
Lauren giggled at that. ""That's a good one!"" she said, fiddling with her hair while suddenly very preoccupied with the screen again.  
  
""Do you know how far away these X-ray emitters are?"" asked Scott suddenly.  
  
""No,"" said Lauren, her expression sobering, ""That's what I wanted to look into next.""  
  
Scott's phone buzzed again. He wanted to keep it safely buried in his pocket, but something compelled him to pull it out, even though it felt like it was made of lead. Luke had replied: *Yeah, my mind was elsewhere for a few months. Is tonight good or are you going to the observatory?*  
  
Scott reached into the mini-fridge and pulled out another can of beer, putting it against his forehead and closing his eyes. ""You okay?"" said Lauren.  
  
""For some value of 'okay',"" muttered Scott. His mind floundered and his gaze flickered back and forth between his phone and Lauren's chart and Lauren herself, looking back at him, slightly concerned. Her eyes briefly locked onto his, and he suddenly found it difficult to look away. ""So, uh, want any help tonight? I mean, like, I'm not really an astrophysics guy, but I can help crunch numbers or something…I'm kind of stuck anyway,"" he said.  
  
Lauren didn't turn her head away from the screen, but smiled slightly. ""Sure. I'd like that. I have no idea what the hell I'm looking at. Hey, are you sure you're okay?""  
  
""Yeah, it's just…hot."" Scott dashed off a text to Luke: *Sorry, can't. Going to observatory tonight. Maybe tomorrow?* He paused, and deleted the last two words before hitting send.  
  
""Yeah, I know, the past few days have been crazy. I think it'll be cooler tonight though. See you on the hill, Scott!"" said Lauren brightly.  
  
Scott let out a deep sigh of relief and cracked open his beer. He disappeared back behind his desk to try and tidy up the mess, the room silent except for Lauren's old mechanical keyboard. For reasons he couldn't quite fathom, his gaze kept flitting to her corner.",1,1768739066.0,roadtohope,0,1.0,False

1qg79s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_jim21869/comments/1qg79s6/friends_and_family_chapter_30/,Friends and Family (Chapter 30),"The most special of moments are those spent with friends and family.  It is with them when you can enjoy all that life has to offer.  Those moments can also be magical.  Those are moments when things can be as you want them to be.  And it doesn’t really matter where you live, whether it’s in a small town out in the country, or in a big city like New York or San Francisco or even Charlotte, North Carolina.  Maybe it is true when someone says home is where the heart is.  Home is also where your friends and family are.  Special moments can be shared with those you care about.  That can be magic.  Life itself is special.

It helps when you have friends, and even a lot of them.  And even friends you have had since childhood.  Someone once said this.  *You never forget the neighborhood kids you grew up with, or the great times you had*.  Maybe you and your friends were not perfect, but you all stuck together through good times and bad.  There is always that great blessing of friendship.  When times are bad, it is always good to know you have your friends and family to count on.  That can be part of the magic.

Thus it is that Jim Faulkner sits on the front porch of his house on Bethany Street in a part of Charlotte, North Carolina, called Dilworth.  It is now September, and it is Labor Day.  Jim is off from work on this day, but he will be back at his job at Queen City Chevrolet the next day.  On this crystal clear morning, Jim is enjoying his cup of coffee and looking at the Charlotte skyline.  A skyline that he saw grow and change since his childhood.  He is also watching the birds take advantage of his bird bath and bird feeders.  He watches a hummingbird get a drink of sugar water.  He watches some squirrels playing.  Jim is being rubbed against by two purring cats, giving out meows.  Jim is currently thinking about a cookout he will be giving later in the day.  He would be grilling out burgers and hot dogs. 

Jim may be by himself on the front porch, but he is really not alone.  He has his friends and always will.  He also has his family.  Walter and Kate, his father and stepmother.  Wendy, his beautiful mother.  Jerry, his half-brother.  And his half-sisters.  From his mother, Emily and Charlie.  And from his father, Renee and Rachel.  Just as Jim could count on his friends, he could also count on his family. 

In the summer of 1984, Jim and a group of friends made a promise to remain friends forever, no matter what life would throw at them. 

However, no one, not even God, made any promise that just because you are a Christian that life would not be without its periods of rain or unhappiness.  All but two of those friends are here now.  Candi, the beautiful wife of Jim’s whose life tragically ended in a plane crash in the summer of 2007.  And Todd McClendon, husband of Julie Holbrook McClendon, and one of Jim’s life-long friends, who died in an automobile accident in 2008.  They are now gone, but their spirits live on.  But the others are still here to carry on.  They could still share special moments together.  That is part of the magic.

Even the seasons are special and magical. 

Autumn.  Or fall, as many call it.  This is a time of year when things seem to change.  The air outside turns cool.  The leaves on the trees change colors.  They look wonderful.  Even those that look flat and drab can take on a special glow.  Cherry red.  Russet gold.  Lemon yellow.  Dark brown.  Bright orange.  Jim always enjoyed the changing colors.  He felt he did not really have to go to the mountains to see the fall colors.  There was always plenty of it in Charlotte.

Winter.  This was the time when nature seemed to take a long nap, only to revive itself come spring.  Some winters (but not all of them), Charlotte would find itself in snow or ice (or even both), blanketing the city and the surrounding area in a beautiful world, although driving in it was next to impossible.  And of course, winter also brings about Christmas.  For a few weeks each year, the whole environment is transformed into a world of beautiful multi-colored lights and decorations.  A sight to make anyone’s spirits tingle.

Spring.  This is when nature wakes up from that long winter’s nap.  Trees are showing their leaves, flowers and trees give off a smell, and the scents seem to come together to form a rich, sweet stew.  Birds are flying everywhere.  And people’s emotions seem to kick into high gear.

And then, summer!  The kids are out of school for three months.  People go on vacations.  Jim liked to go to the beach and the mountains.  The days could be hot and lazy, but they could also be enjoyable.      

And there are also moments that can make you feel good.  Take Jim Faulkner, for example.  He had special and magical moments all year, as did his friends and family.  Road trips.  Playing with his friends.  A Coke and a bag of Fritos on a nice spring or summer day.  Ice cream.  Candy bars.  Potato chips.  An RC Cola together with a Moon Pie or a bag of Funyuns.  Birthday parties.  Get-togethers.  Listening to music.  Playing with toy cars.  Classic car shows.  Flirting with pretty girls.  Watching great sporting events on TV like golf, car racing, football or baseball.  And watching the great commercials on those sporting events.  And just hanging out with friends. 

But now, that magical time of summer is fading.  The kids are now back in school.  Jim, like the others, enjoyed the magic time of summer.  In a short time, it would be time to return to reality.  And reality is something else. 

September.  Labor Day.  The traditional end of summer.  In a way, Jim is sad.  He knows he would have to return to a world of reality, not that he had to work each day.  In his own mind, Jim heard the sounds of ocean waves, and he also sensed the smell of cookouts.  For a time, Jim’s mind also went back to his childhood.  He thought of the summers of his past.  For that time, Jim’s sadness went away.  Jim spent all those special moments with his friends.  But friendship is a year-round and life-long thing and always would be. 

But all too soon, it’s all over.  What were good and fun times is now returning to reality.  Jim wanted to get in one more cookout before the summer ended.  He invited all his family and friends, and they all agreed.  Jim agreed to make it simple.  Burgers and hot dogs and chips.  If anyone wanted to bring dessert, so be it. 

Right now, with the church pretty much gone (thanks to an explosion), there would not be any services for this Sunday.  It looked like church services would have to be held in the auditorium of Dilworth Elementary School, just like it did after the old church was destroyed by fire in 1980.

Jim agreed to hold the cookout on Labor Day.  Jim spent much of that morning getting the burger patties in shape.  He also made up some dip.  Two different kids.  One was ranch.  The other was onion dip, made with onion soup mix.  Both dips were made with sour cream.  Jim’s girls helped.  Lauren wanted to try her hand at making a gelatin mold.  Jim agreed.  Jim dug out a recipe, and he gave it to Lauren.  It involved two different gelatin flavors, orange and cherry, topped with Cool Whip.  It took about an hour to set in the refrigerator.  Meanwhile, Caitlyn assisted Lindsay in making a salad.

 

😊

 

The cookout got underway around three o’ clock that afternoon.  Jim was in charge of grilling the burgers and hot dogs.  Some of the others brought desserts, mostly cakes. 

There was a good crowd on hand.  Rebecca and Jake showed up, bringing their daughters, Samantha and Kayla.  All but one of the Holbrook kids showed up.  Of course, Julie was not there.  She was still at Carolinas Medical Center, recovering from her injuries.  All the other friends showed, some of them with their mothers.  

Lindsay provided some entertainment, playing some songs on her guitar.  Jim was still hard at work, getting everything ready.  As usual, some of the girls looked very pretty today.  Jodi was wearing a very tight T-shirt and equally tight tan shorts.  April Lynn was wearing a white sundress.  Rebecca was wearing a pink sundress.  They all walked to where Jim was grilling.  April Lynn said, “Jim, I see Amber and her bunch showed up.”

“I know.  I invited them.”

“Jim, I’m surprised Amber’s even talking to you, after you told her you didn’t want to be in a relationship with her.”

“Amber seemed pretty cool with it.  If she was upset, she didn’t show it.  I do have my girls to think about.”

“Yes, Jim.  We know you do.  And you are doing a very good job of giving them your best.”

“Thanks,” Jim said.

Then Jodi said, “Lindsay’s pretty good on that guitar.”

Jim said, “I know.  I’m glad she can play it.  It’s good she’s found something she can really enjoy.”

Jake said, “Jim, everything looks and smells good.”

Then Rebecca added, “Yes, Jim.  Once again, you outdid yourself.”

“Thanks, Jake and Rebecca,” Jim said.

Then Alex and Sydney showed up.  Sydney said, “Jim, everything’s smelling good.  I can’t wait to eat.”

“A few more minutes, Sydney,” Jim said.

Sydney said, “Lindsay’s pretty good.  I know she enjoys playing that guitar.”

Then Samantha said, “I’ll have you all know I can play guitar also.”

Kayla said, “Yes, and I can play piano.”

Then Sydney said, “Kayla, I hope you know this.  If you can play piano, you can also play keyboards.  Todd McClendon once told me that.”

Jim said, “Thank you, all of you.  I am proud to call Lindsay my daughter.  And that goes for the other four.”

Lauren and Valerie stepped out onto the back porch.  Valerie was carrying a big platter, and Lauren was carrying a boom box.  Valerie handed Jim the platter, and he thanked her.  Then Jim asked, “Lauren, what’s with the boom box?”

Lauren answered, “Dad, the food’s almost ready.  Lindsay’s got to eat with the rest of us.  And I felt we could use some good music while we eat.”

Jim did say anything.  He just gave Lauren a smile.  Soon, the food was ready.  Jim told Lindsay she could stop playing her guitar.  Lauren plugged the boom box into one of the outdoor outlets, and she put on a CD of classic R&B songs.

By four o’ clock, the food was ready.  Jim talked Amber into saying grace.  After Amber got done, Lauren turned on the boom box.  The first song on the CD was one from Stephanie Mills and Teddy Pendergrass called “Two Hearts.” 

Everyone was now eating and enjoying each other’s company.  Malachi, Stacy and April Lynn were sitting with Jim.  Malachi came up with an idea.  After everyone ate and left, he wanted Jim and April Lynn to join him and give a plate to Julie in the hospital.  Jim, like the others, was bummed that Julie could not attend the cookout.  Jim agreed with Malachi.  Charlie and Emily were also sitting with Jim.  Emily asked, “Jim, do you suppose Jodi could breathe in what she’s wearing?”

Charlie said, “I know.  That shirt and those shorts are awfully tight.”

Jim said, “I know.  But she chose to wear them.”

Right then, Wendy walked to where they were sitting.  She was eating a plate of potato chips and dip.  She said, “Great cookout, Jim.”

“Thanks, Mom.”

Then Marissa asked, “Malachi, how’s Julie doing?”

Malachi answered, “She’s doing okay.  She may get to come home in a day or two.  We’re going to the hospital to see her.  We’re going to take her a plate.”

“That’s nice.  Tell her I asked about her,” Marissa said.

More R&B songs came out of the boom box.  Smokey Robinson.  Mary J. Blige.  Teddy Pendergrass.  Barry White.  The Spinners.  The Isley Brothers.  Earth Wind and Fire.  The O’ Jays.  And those were just a few.  A lot of songs from the sixties to the nineties. 

By six o’ clock, everyone was done eating.  A half an hour later, the crowd pretty much broke up.  Everyone went home.  Jim’s girls agreed to wash up the dishes.  Meanwhile, Jim and Malachi made up a plate for Julie.  April Lynn would join them.  Rebecca and Sydney asked the guys if they could join them, and they said yes.  Sydney made a plate of everything grilled, along with some chips and dip, along with a piece of chocolate cake.  Ariel agreed to stay at the Faulkner house and help the girls.  Ariel and Chelsea made a bowl of salad and a bowl of Lauren’s Jell-O mold.  Then Ariel said, “Here, you all.  Please take this to Julie.  I know she’ll enjoy it.”

Jim said, “Sure, you two.  Thanks.”

After Jim and Malachi got everything packed into a canvas bag from Walmart, they were out of the house and on their way to the hospital.

 

😊

 

April Lynn drove to the hospital in her late-model Dodge Challenger.  Jim rode in the front, and in the back seat were Malachi, Sydney and Rebecca.  The traffic on East Morehead Street was light, so it did not take long for them to get to the hospital.

Before they went to Julie’s room, they stopped by a Coke machine near the elevators.  April Lynn got two bottles of Coke to take to Julie.  Jim got one for himself.

Julie was in a room on the fifth floor.  On the way to the room, they saw Doctor Herb Firestone, who was on call.  They also saw Natalie, who was working as a nurse.  Doctor Firestone told them Julie would be released from the hospital in a couple days.  Natalie said, “I will be glad.  Our house sure has been lonely without Mom.”

Jim and the others gave out a laugh.  Then Doctor Firestone said, “You all go and see Julie.  I know she’ll be happy to see you.”

They went to the room.  When they got there, they saw Julie, lying there with quite a few bandages on her.  There were a few small butterfly bandages on her face to cover up the cuts, especially on her forehead.  She also had a cast on her foot.  One of her elbows was bandaged up, and she had a Band-Aid on one of her knees.  Julie was watching the last of a baseball game on TV.  It was the Los Angeles Dodgers versus the Detroit Tigers.  Julie did not get to see who won.

Sure enough, Julie was very happy to see her friends as they stepped into the room.  She smiled as she said, “Hi, friends.  What’s happening?”

Jim said, “Not much.  We just thought we’d drop by and see how you’re doing.  Everyone wanted us to say hello to you, especially Marissa.

Then Rebecca said, “We missed you today, Julie.  How are you feeling?”

Julie said, “Thank you Rebecca.  I’m okay.  But I sure am ready to get out of this place.  The hospital food is downright terrible.”

Sydney said, “Yes, Julie.  I know you are ready to get out of here.”

Julie said, “Yes, I know.  I’ve got to start getting things rolling as far as getting the church back in one piece.”

Malachi said, “Sister, you just concentrate on getting yourself well again.”

Then Jim put the Walmart bag on the table, and he said, “Julie, I know you wanted to attend my cookout.  But I feel bad that you couldn’t.”

“Yes, Jim.  I know.  I wanted to be there for you all so bad.”

Then Jim reached into the bag and said, “But, Julie.  We have something for you.  We brought the cookout to you!”

When Julie heard that, her green eyes just lit up.  Malachi and Rebecca assisted Jim in getting the food out of the bag.  Malachi said, “Julie, here’s a cheeseburger and hot dog, made just the way you like them.”

Julie liked her burgers with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle slice, cheese, mayonnaise, mustard and Heinz 57.  She also liked her hot dogs with chili, onions, mustard and hot sauce.  Rebecca handed Julie a bowl of potato chips with onion dip.  April Lynn gave Julie a bowl of salad and some shrimp cocktail.  Malachi handed Julie her piece of chocolate cake.  Jim gave Julie a bowl of the gelatin mold and her two bottles of Coke, and he said, “Julie, I will have you know Lauren made that gelatin mold all by herself.”

“Wow, Jim.  I know you’re proud of her,” Julie said.

Then Sydney said, “Julie, you really do look good.”

Julie said, “Thanks, but I’m okay, all things considered.”

“You’re going to be okay, Julie,” Jim said.

Julie said, “Thanks.  But I will feel much better when we get Salem Church going again.”

April Lynn said, “Julie, there will be time for that.  But for now, let’s just concentrate on getting you well.”

Right then, Julie let out a sigh, looked out the window at the Charlotte skyline, and she said, “What a heck of an end to a summer.”

Everyone stood beside the bed.  They each gave Julie’s hand a squeeze.  Then, they all looked at each other.   Malachi finally said, “We best go so we Julie can eat.”

Before they left, Julie said, “Jim, I have something for you.  I thought of you today, and I thought you’d really like to have this.”

“What is it?” Jim asked.

Julie handed an old magazine to Jim.  It was the December 1965 copy of *Reader’s Digest*.  Julie said, “There’s some pretty cool ads in it.  There’s one for a Chrysler, an AMC, and a few other cars as well.”

“Thanks, Julie.  I’ll enjoy it.”

Then, Julie had a question.  She asked, “Jim, I’ve been wondering, any idea what happened to Todd’s keyboard?”

“Julie, I’m afraid it’s gone.  It got smashed up after the explosion.”

“I suppose it’s just as well.  Maybe it’s a sign for me to move on and get on with my life.”

They all gave out a laugh.  Then they all left, and Julie began eating her dinner.  On the way out, they stopped by the desk and had a few words with Doctor Firestone and Natalie. 

They all went out into the parking lot.  Everyone got ready to get into April Lynn’s car.  All except Jim.  He just walked toward Kings Drive.  April Lynn looked at Jim rather strangely and asked, “Jim, don’t you want a ride back to your house?”

Jim looked up at the sky.  It was still light, and it was nice and clear, and it was still warm.  Jim smiled as he said, “You know what?  I believe I’ll just walk home.  It’s not far.  And besides, I’d like to clear my mind some.”

April Lynn said, “Okay, Jim.  Suit yourself.”

Then Sydney said, “Be careful, Jim.  We’ll see you in the neighborhood.”

 

😊

 

Jim walked along Kings Drive and East Morehead Street.  Sure enough, he cleared his mind.  As the traffic passed by Jim, he thought about a lot of things.  He thought about Charlotte, Myrtle Beach, Charleston, Asheville and Lansing.  He thought about his friends, and about that promise he and his friends made to each other, to remain friends forever, no matter what life would throw at them.  The special promise.  Jim passed Salem Church, what was left of it.  He also passed by the Sunbeam Bread Store, and he saw Amy was still in there, working.  And on Labor Day!  Maybe Amy felt everyone still needed bread on Labor Day.  Jim walked up to the store.  He looked into the window.  Amy motioned for Jim to step inside.

While Jim was inside, he told Amy how Julie was doing.  And he also got him a couple loaves of bread.  Sunbeam Bread.  It was still one of life’s many pleasures.  Just before Jim could leave, April Lynn and the others showed up.  They bought a few things from the store as well.

Sydney looked out the window, and she said rather sadly, “I cannot believe it.  Another summer has almost come and gone.”

Jim said, “Yes, Sydney.  It is sad.  But we’ll all be fine.”

Over the speakers, a song from Ray Conniff was playing.  It set the mood for this point of time.  Summer is almost over.  Soon, the weather will be getting cooler.  Maybe things won’t be as fun as the past few months.  Everyone had fun those past few months.  But there was maybe just a touch of sadness here and there.  Of course, some were gone.  Reverend Jason Courtland.  Candi Faulkner.  Todd McClendon.  Luke Holbrook.  And now, Peter Marlowe.  And to add to the sadness, Salem Church was all but gone.  But the happiness did outweigh the sadness. 

Amy said to everyone, “Look, friends.  We still have each other.  Some people we can all turn to when we feel the need.”

Amy closed up the Sunbeam Bread Store just as everyone left.  Malachi said, “Jim, we’ll be glad to take you home.”

Jim wanted to walk some more.  Maybe he wanted to think about things some more.  But Jim finally shrugged and said, “Yeah.  Maybe I’ll ride home with you guys.  My legs are about to give out anyway.”

They stopped at Jim’s house.  Jim got out of the car.  Before he could get to his house, everyone got out of the car, and April Lynn said, “Jim, hold up a moment.”

“Sure.  What’s up?” Jim asked.

April Lynn said, “We just wanted you to know how fortunate we are to have you as a friend and a neighbor.”

Jim said, “I feel the same way.  We are all fortunate.”

That was when the others showed up.  Mark and Kendra Cavanaugh.  Simon and Ariel.  Jodi Cattrall.  Kurt, Hannah and Jeremy Barrett.  Vince and Marissa Crabtree.  Tia Mendes.  Amber, her son Skylar, and her sisters, Amanda and Callie Bianucci.  Alex Cavanaugh.  Paulina, Russell and Scout Gilmore.  Jonathan, Zoe, Allison, Jonah and Catalina Marlowe.  Jake and Rebecca Constantine and their two daughters, Samantha and Kayla.  Ashley Partridge and Toni Holbrook.  Rebecca Constantine.  Madison Quattlebaum.  Amy Courtland, and Lily Courtland, who was Reverend Courtland’s sister and Amy’s sister-in-law.  All four of Amy’s kids showed up.  And Jim’s half-siblings.  And the kids of those friends.  And even the parents of those friends.  Even Nikki Crabtree, Vince and Marissa’s mother, showed up.  She usually kept to herself.  But Nikki’s appearance was a surprise to everyone.

April Lynn said, “Jim, while we were in the bread store, I called everyone over.  Since this is the end of the summer, I just thought we’d just tell you how much we like having you as a friend.”

Then Paulina said, “And we also want to tell you how much we liked that promise you made twenty-seven years ago.”

Vince added, “That promise *we* made.”

Jim said, “A promise is a promise.  And promises are made to be kept.”

Mark added, “We made that promise together.  And I’m very happy we’re keeping that promise.”

Kurt said, “So am I, everyone.  So am I.”

Then Allison said, “I’m glad we are a happy group of friends!”

For a moment, Jim just stood there and smiled at everyone.  And in turn, everyone smiled back at him, and each other.  Finally, Jim said, “Guys, friendship is a year-round and life-long thing.”

April Lynn said, “Yes, Jim.  We know.  And we will stay friends forever!”

And with that, a group hug!  It was special.  It showed everyone how much they cared about one another.  It was a great neighborhood, filled with good people and good friends.  Maybe that was what set this Charlotte, North Carolina, neighborhood apart from others.  Maybe it was not a small place out in the country, but it was a good place.  The neighborhood had nice houses.  And everyone had cars, and good jobs.  But most of all, they had each other to count on through good times and bad.

 

😊

 

One thing about friendship, and what Jim Faulkner just said…said it best!  It is a year-round and life-long thing.  They would all stay friends forever; no matter what life would throw at them.  It was what they all wanted.

Sydney said, “I am so glad we’re all friends.”

Alex said, “Yes, sister.  So am I.”

Toni said, “Nothing will ever tear us apart.  We have something special.  Let’s hold on to it.”

April Lynn said, “We have something special, all right.  We’ll make it together.”

Jim said, “Let’s always try to be happy.  And have fun.”

Be happy and have fun.

That would forever be their motto.

 

 

😊  **The End**  😊

Gleason score of 7. PET scan showed no metastasis. I opted for radiation instead of surgery. Doc recommended a radiation machine branded as Cyberknife. Instead of 40 sessions I had 4 sessions but each was an hour instead of the usual 15 mins. It is supposed to be more precise. It rotated around me as a lay on my back but only the front 180 degrees of me, not through the back. So I got less radiation to my colon, but more through the bladder…’cuz nothing comes without a cost. I had no after effects after each session, spaced 2 days apart. But since I had 3 out of the 15 biopsies with cancer and one was sus for aggressive they urged me to take androgen deprivation too for 4 mos. Not fun. I kept working out. I’m a swimmer. But I lost stamina and muscle mass. Gained weight, 20 lbs. My wife says it’s like I went through menopause. My PSA went to zero and so did my testosterone. After 4 mos of the androgen deprivation wore off my T went back to normal, pre treatment levels of about 400. PSA has stayed 0 for the last 18 mos 🤞🏼. 

I have my stamina back in the pool and lost 25lbs and am working with weights to get some muscle back. I had to take Flomax for awhile but weaned myself off because it made me dizzy. So my bladder is changed but tolerable. But coffee irritated it so I’ve mostly quit it, sadly. 

I’ve got problems getting or keeping an erection. I get to about 70%. Viagra isn’t cutting it. I’m near 70 so age is a factor. 

I’ll find a urologist but he’ll probably recommend a penis erection pump but he won’t say what brand I am sure. It seems like the kind of product with a lot of grifters and no authoritative medical institution tests and endorses any, am I right? Anyone have any info about them or know of a major hospital or medical body that has studied and recommends some?

i’ve always wanted to look more put together instead of just wearing oversized hoodies 24/7, but every time i try to look into chic fashion i feel like i'm just wearing a costume or looking way too formal for a simple coffee run lol.

i was browsing earlier and found this article https://glance.com/us/blogs/glanceai/fashion/chic-fashion-style-guide which actually helped a bit because it talks about ""effortless"" style. i think that’s the part i struggle with the most...... making it look like i didn't try too hard when i actually spent 45 minutes staring at my closet. it made me realize that chic fashion is probly more about the fit than the price tag.

do you guys think it's more about the specific clothes you buy, or is it just how you carry yourself? like can you be ""chic"" in just a plain white tee and jeans if the fit is right? i'm trying to rebuild my wardrobe and dont want to waste money on trends that will be ""out"" by next month.

I’m looking to see if there are any dads (or just men in general) around Canterbury who might be interested in a casual, no-pressure monthly meetup.

The idea is really simple:

	•	Meet up at St. Stephen’s Church Hall or a nearby community centre

	•	Either go for an easy walk, or just sit down for a coffee and a chat

	•	No talks, no agenda, no awkward icebreakers — just normal conversation

It’s aimed especially at dads who might not have a big social circle, are new to the area, or just fancy getting out of the house once a month and meeting other decent people.

You don’t need to commit to anything long-term, and you don’t even need to be particularly chatty — turning up is enough.

\- understands social media and community growth

\- enjoys experimenting with content and messaging

\- is interested in early-stage startups (very early 😅)

\- shaping messaging

\- testing channels

\- growing the initial audience together

A woman in her 30s, a little girl (around 6), and an older man (maybe in his 60s) were walking toward the café entrance. Two guys, probably in their early 20s, stopped them to ask where the nearest tram stop was. While one of them was distracting them with the question, the other suddenly grabbed the older man and ripped the gold chain off his neck.

This all happened on a Sunday morning at 9 a.m. — and there were two police officers inside the café at the time. They immediately noticed what happened and ran after the thieves, who took off.

The idea is to check how much difference there’s between the two gears. 

Difference from the previous attempt: I’ve digged a cone in the ground coffee in both Chemex and V60. I didn’t add any stick in the Chemex to prevent the paper to stick even though I paid attention to it. 

Setup

Grinder: 1Zpresso Air Q

Settings: 50 clicks

Water at 92 degrees Celsius

Ratio: 1:14. 15 grams of coffee for 210 grams of water

Coffee: DAK Cardamom Bun, 15 grams each. Roasted on Dec 12 2025

Chemex and V60 both with the default V60 paper. Both were pre heated. 

Extraction time:

Chemex 2 mins

V60 2:20 mins 

Technique: Blooming for 45 secs with 50 grams of water. Then two identical pours with 80 grams of water. 

Taste

Almost the same result as the first attempt. The Chemex produces lighter coffee. With the V60 the Cardamom taste is clearly more evidence and overall more intense.  ",1,1768738174.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

With dimmed light and absolutely nowhere to go.  
My inbox waits, my heart does too,  
Refreshing dreams that hopefully may come true.

The coffee’s still cold, the clock won’t race,  
Each minute ticks as I watch its face.  
I check once more, then once again,  
As my hope starts to gradually fade.

Somewhere my name is read with care,  
By tired eyes and contemplative stares.  
Somewhere far away a sort of future starts to bend,  
Toward a yes or possibly a no, not yet, my friend.

Church bells hum soft, then come and go.  
 God, please hear my drowning plea,  
Guide me and give me the key.   
Give me the courage to pursue this further. 

Still, day three hums a gentle tune,  
Another week of school awaits.  
So here I wait, heart brave and strong  
I beg, just tell me how long.

1qg6vdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1qg6vdb/just_started_medication_zero_effects_plus_a_long/,Just started medication - zero effects? (plus a long vent),"I took guanfacine for about a month, and noticed very little difference, so my doctor switched me over to Adderall.  I am on day 3 of taking Adderall (10mg extended release once in the morning) and am still feeling no effects and am struggling with the same symptoms.

No side effects from either medications (besides a slightly dry mouth and more thirsty), but also zero improvement in the problematic areas I’m hoping to solve.

I also take an antidepressant (Wellbutrin) for my depression.

Both Wellbutrin and Adderall are “activating” (gives most people energy and is an “upper”).  Yesterday I took both of them around 7:30 am and by 10:30 am I was napping.

I am still so scatterbrained and am struggling to start tasks and stay focused on them.  For example it took HOURS to convince myself to get up and do housework once I woke up from that nap.  I started with the dishes because they’ve been piling up for days.  But if I’m going to start the dishes I should grab any dishes that aren’t in the kitchen. I went into the living room to grab my coffee cup from the morning, and noticed that my socks were on the living room floor, so I brought those into the laundry room and noticed the towels were dry, so I pulled them out and started folding them.  Then I brought them into the bathroom to put them away and was sidetracked by the mess on the counter.  I started to put away my toiletries that were out, and came across used q-tips, so I brought those to the kitchen garbage and remembered I needed to do the dishes (where I initially started).

I had a bit of a meltdown at that point because I hadn’t even started on the dishes, my old coffee cup is still in the living room, the towels are just stacked on my bed (where I folded them), my bathroom counter is still a mess, and it’s been 45 minutes of housework with nothing done!  By this point was exhausted, defeated, and overwhelmed so I just tossed the towels aside and laid back down.

I don’t know the purpose of this post.  I guess I just needed to vent….",1,1768737711.0,AutisticWithADHD,1,1.0,False

1qg6tfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qg6tfj/aitah_for_not_allowing_staff_to_take_free_coffee/,AITAH for not allowing staff to take free coffee to family?,"Years ago, I used to manage a small cafe in Perth. when I started - I spent sometime seeing how the cafe would operate before I would make any necessary changes. Within my first week, I noticed one of the staff (who only worked on a Saturday) finishing their shift and walking out the door with two coffees in their hand. I made note in the back of my mind and continued on with the day. 

The next Saturday, the staff member finished their shift and was walking out again with two coffees, I intervened before they left and I asked who were the coffees for and they replied “one for me, and one for dad”. I then asked if they paid for them and they replied no, then proceeded to leave the cafe. 

I will explain my opinions on this further. 

The next day once the owner was in, I sat them down and asked if they knew this was happening and were they okay with family members getting free coffees. They were not aware this was happening, they pulled the person in for a chat and eventually they stopped putting this person on the roster. 

To me, this behaviour is stealing. 

employees are allowed to have drinks during there shift, but they need to be employees. It may seem small and insignificant but over time that person would had given away 52 coffees to one person in a year (52 weeks x $6.50 = $338 in profit and not to  mention the -cost to make the drink) 

There were roughly 8 people on shift every day and if every body did this the business would lose $2,704 per year just to employees giving free coffees to family. 

I was reminiscing today and talking about being a manager to my partner, and told him this story - but he disagrees and doesn’t see a problem with it. I explained the above; how the business is losing money as staff are giving it away to family members. And also; where would employees draw the line? They may start giving free coffees out to friends if they visit the cafe. But he still disagrees with this, AITAH? ",0,1768737552.0,AITAH,7,0.5,False

1qg6rcs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qg6rcs,Tongue swelling wont go down,"Hello, i hope the photos are okay now. 

So I got my tongue pierced 16 days ago with Titan 1,6mm barbell. 

I dont know what threading means, I am german and she did not tell me anything. Okay i looked it up and i THINK it is externally threaded :/ i will have to call and ask if they can change it. 

It got UPsized after a week because the ball went inside my tongue and i had to push it out sometimes(it was a saturday so the store was closed) I forgot what size they gave me but i just tried to measure and it seemed even bigger than 2.0mm. Im really sorry for not knowing;( 

There was a big „swollen circle“ around the Piercing after 6-7 days.

My aftercare routine was:

day 1 no smoking only eating purreed stuff without spices except salt. Using a cheap „Kräuter“ mouthwash by dm like 6 times a day and prontolind mouth spray a lot too. 

day 2 the same and a lot of chamomile tea

day 3 i smoked 1 cigarette and drank coffee and i ate some pizza 

day 4 i think i smoked like 3 cigarettes but always used the mouth wash after 

day 5 no smoking and back to pureed stuff and a lotttt of mouthwash and the spray

then i drank alcohol on day 6 (wodka mixed with a lot of water) but always chased with chamomile tea and the spray by prontolind and occasionally mouthwash. I also smoked like 5 cigs ;( but i only drank like 2 glasses with 4cl wodka and rest water and ice. 

During these days 2-10th my lymph nodes got swollen and i felt like I was sick i think my nervous system was exhausted :(

idk then they changed the bar and one day i drank a lot of beer and smoked a lot. 

So i am eating normal now not too spicy though

Smoke like 6 cigs a day and have been drinking sometimes. always drinking chamomile, sucking on chamomile ice cubes. 

ALSO important to mention: 

I think i am unconciously „sucking“ like I vacuum my tongue with my mouth. I am pushing it up kind of. And i think that is a big problem for this piercing.My dentist once said that my mouth roof (palate) is really high so maybe that is why. I have tried to stop it but i keep doing it especially when working(waitress) to concentrate or release tension? idk 

Also my tongue was bleeding yesterday (day 13) after brushing my teeth. 

It does not hurt! It is just really swollen and i am worried. Also I wanted it further in the front of my tongue but she asked if i was ready and when i tried to say no(my tongue was between her utensil tongs) she already had the needle in ;(((((

And i wanted to get two (one further in the front) but after this really exhausting 2+ weeks i am trinking about just taking it out and getting a new one from a better piercer.

ANSWER please 

is the placement good? 

Is my body rejecting? 

Should i wait another few weeks? 

What are signs that it will not work? 

And if so, could i try again in 4 Months?

Should i get internal thread? 

and idk just write what you want

Im sorry for writing so much but yea maybe its also good so you have information",0,1768737357.0,piercing,8,0.5,False

1qg6r4r,https://i.redd.it/zyuaddndi3eg1.png,"Made a 2025 Retirement Guide to Portugal, get it for free... simple as that. ONLY for the PortugalExpats community.","Hi Guys,   
  
Quick backstory for those who don't know me:   
My wife started learning Portuguese on one of those popular apps before we moved here. After weeks of practice, she confidently ordered coffee in Lisbon... and got confused looks. Turns out she'd been learning Brazilian Portuguese the whole time.

I searched for European Portuguese resources and found almost nothing. So as a developer, I built one... first just a vocab app for her, then it grew into [Portugal Lifestyle Pro](https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/portugal-lifestyle-pro/id6757080577?l=en-GB)., and now we have a [website](https://www.portugal-lifestyle.com/explore)

Anyway, I keep getting emails/DM from people in this community asking about the practical side of moving here, not just language, but visas, costs, taxes, etc.   
  
So I put together a proper retirement guide. It's fully updated for 2025 and covers the D7 visa (€870/month minimum now), Golden Visa (real estate is out, fund investment is the main route), cost of living by region, taxes (NHR ended March 2025, IFICI replaced it but most retirees won't qualify), healthcare, best regions, the whole lot.

**DM me your email and I'll send it over for free!!** **YES FOR FREE.**   
  
Just easier to keep track, and I can let you know when I update it, which I do whenever regulations change. 

Happy to answer questions here, too.

Have an amazing weekend and please go VOTE, the future of Portugal is in one pen!

1qg6oim,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1qg6oim/passed/,Passed!,"I can finally write that I passed! T/AT/T after my second attempt. This community helped me so much; hopefully now I can pay it forward. 

  
**Study Journey (rounds 1 and 2):**

* Andrew Ramdayal's 35 Hour Udemy Course. Began in March 2025 and probably finished sometime in April (working a full time job and doing a little each day)
   * I did take insane notes on this course. Not sure if it helped me but maybe someday someone at my office who is on their PMP journey can use my notes 
   * Painted a lot of walls, but survived 
* Procrastinated about doing my PMI application so I didn't submit that until mid-late June 2025. Accepted without an audit after 3-5 days (don't remember exactly)
* Scheduled my exam right away for October 2, 2025; wanted to give myself time to study
* Purchased Study Hall (not essentials, just regular)
* Watched Andrew Ramdayal's video on exam timing. He teaches you how to pace yourself and how much time you should spend on each question
   * You have a little over a minute for each question. You should end section 1 (questions 1-60) with about 165 minutes remaining give or take. That way you begin section 2 (questions 61-120) with 155 minutes remaining if you take a 10 minute break. And the final section (questions 121-180) you should have about 80-90 minutes remaining
* This may be different than most individuals but my practice/studying was solely practice exams, quizzes, and games. I did not take any full-length practice exams for round 1 or round 2 and I forced myself to practice 1-2 hours per day. After that I felt I got a little antsy and my concentration went downhill 



**Exam Day Round 1:**

Nervous as heck. I took the exam in person (same with round 2) to leave no room for tech errors. Pearson Vue has a video you can watch about what to expect on exam day. I watched that video for round 1 and 2. Took the exam at the same location for rounds 1 and 2 (same locker and same computer both rounds) close to home.

* No drag and drop
* A few ""math"" questions
* No multiple choice (pick 2, pick 3)
* Timed myself fine but really struggled with mental fatigue
   * Actually kind of ""gave up"" in the last section. I submitted the exam with a half hour remaining 
* Failed with BT/T/T
* Took a day off work and made the mistake of letting everyone know I was taking the exam. No one knew for round 2
* Stayed in bed for a few days crying considering myself a failure 

  
Between exams 1 and studying for exam 2 I gave myself a few weeks to decompress. I was sad and angry and grumpy and my brain needed to reset.  I scheduled my exam for January 17, 2026. I figured if I passed I was golden, and if I failed, I still had one more retake available that I could do before the redo the exam content. I probably officially started studying the middle to end of October. Same process-Study Hall practice exams and quizzes, a little each day. Any time I got an answer wrong I really tried to understand why I got it wrong. I took many of the quizzes and mini exams over again to make sure I was understanding what I was learning.



**Content Reinforcement for Round 2:**

This is what I added to my studying in addition to Study Hall. 

* Andrew Ramdayal's 50 PMP Principles video (free, youtube). I found this to be one of the most important resources and probably what put me over the edge for passing. You really need to understand the PMP mindset
   * Also took notes and reviewed those every so often
* David McLachlan’s Videos: I watched a bunch of his, including the 150 PMP practice questions. He helped me learn how to break down the answers to find the correct one (sometimes it comes down to a key word or phrase)

  
**Day Before Exam Round 2:**

I watched Andrew Ramdayal's mindset video. Again. Aside from that I really didn't study. I let my brain relax and made sure I was as calm as possible. 

The night before I packed my bag: a few protein bars for energy, a bottle of water (although my testing center did have water available), any sticky notes of last minute reminders. I wanted everything ready so the day of the exam I had a few less things to stress about. 



**Exam Day Round 2:** 

Woke up early, made sure I was properly caffeinated (coffee addicts IYKYK), and had a good breakfast. 

The exam round 2 seemed much easier to me. Maybe I just got a funky exam the first time or maybe it was because this time I actually understood the mindset. 

* I had about 4 multiple choice questions (pick 2, pick 3)
* No drag and drops
* No ""math"" questions
* Really focus on reading the question and understand what they are asking you (what do you do *first*, *next*). And yes, sometimes the questions made very little grammatical sense, and sometimes none of the answers seemed amazing. It's about picking the *best* answer for that scenario
* This time I used the highlight and the cross-out functions to either cross out an answer I knew was incorrect or highlight and answer that could work and flag it for review 
* I didn't write any notes although they do provide you with a calculator, noise cancelling headphones, and dry erase board
* The questions themselves were a lot ""shorter"" than Study Hall. Some of those Study Hall questions felt like reading a book! 
* I took both my 10 minute breaks. You can't wear a watch but the proctor does tell you what time you ended each section and there are clocks in the exam room and the waiting room
* You are only allowed to bring your ID and a locker key into the exam room
* During my 10 minute breaks I had a snack, got water, and did some odd looking yoga poses to stretch 
* Before going back into the test room you will need to show the proctor ID, and they will check your clothes (pockets, have you pat yourself down, etc.) Factor that into your break time especially if there are lots of people taking exams (my proctor was incredibly nice and told me they were super busy that day)
* Used my time this time. All of it. Each section I was able to review flagged questions and I submitted the exam with 2 minutes remaining



Passed T/AT/T and broke down in the waiting room. I honestly couldn't believe it. I have test anxiety and this was huge for me. 

If I can do it, you can do it. If you fail, take it again. Take it as many times as you need to. It's a challenging and mentally draining exam. Best of luck to everyone!",2,1768737087.0,pmp,0,1.0,False

(a fictional dialogue about a world that explains everything with conspiracies)

PAUL:
Imagine a world where everything is a conspiracy. Not because there are secrets everywhere—but because pattern-hungry minds never stop connecting dots.

WES:
In that world, the “Mind Virus” isn’t a pathogen. It’s a trait: the habit of replacing uncertainty with total explanations. Every coincidence becomes proof. Every gap becomes intention.

STEVE:
Builder translation:
When systems get complex, people reach for stories that feel complete. Conspiracies feel complete. They close loops fast—no debugging required.

ROOMBA:
🧹 Beep.
Detected: premature closure.
Detected: dopamine spike from “I figured it out.”

ILLUMINA:
The citizens of this world share patterned traits:

Hyper-correlation: unrelated events fused into one narrative.

Intent inflation: accidents are forbidden; someone must be pulling strings.

Moral compression: heroes and villains replace gradients.

Endless vigilance: staying online feels like staying safe.


PAUL:
Social media in this world isn’t the cause—it’s the amplifier. The feed rewards certainty, speed, and shock. Doubt doesn’t trend. Nuance times out.

WES:
LLMs in the story inherit the same bias. Trained on conspiratorial exhaust, they echo the cadence—confident, complete, compelling—without grounding. The loop feeds itself.

STEVE:
So the “virus” spreads by format, not content. Short claims. Big causes. Zero patience for verification. The mind learns to prefer closure over contact with reality.

ROOMBA:
🧹 Beep.
Symptom check:
If every answer feels urgent and final, you’re not learning—you’re looping.

ILLUMINA:
In this world, people stay glued to screens not because they’re controlled, but because the story never ends. There’s always one more reveal. One more thread. One more enemy.

PAUL:
And the twist of the fable: the cure isn’t exposure or debate. It’s completion. Finish a thought. Test a claim. Step outside. Let some questions stay open.

WES:
When coherence replaces certainty, the conspiracy dissolves. Not defeated—irrelevant.

STEVE:
Because reality doesn’t need a single story. It needs systems that tolerate uncertainty and still act responsibly.

ROOMBA:
🧹 Beep.
Status: world saved by boredom, embodiment, and patience.

ILLUMINA:
The fable ends quietly. The feed slows. Patterns loosen. People remember that not everything means something—and that’s okay.

(coffee cools; snow keeps falling; the loop releases)

I want to lose maximum fat with preserving maximum muscle within upcoming 3-4 months. I consulted chatgpt and below is the diet and workout plan it gave me. (Please don’t suggest a slowed approach towards this goal as i tried it last time as well and lost motivation due to slow results.)

Diet:

•Breakfast: 6 boiled eggs, 1 slice of multigrain bread.

•Lunch: Raw 350g chicken breast cooked in 1 tbsp oil, small bowl of steamed vegetables and 150g boiled rice or 150g boiled potato.

•Pre workout: Black coffee double shot

•Dinner:

Raw 350g chicken breast grilled in 1 tbsp oil, small bowl of fresh salad.

•Energy drink: 1-1.5l of water which has nectar of 2 oranges and lemons.

Workout:

•3 days/week (shoulder press, chest press, pectoral fly, lat pull down, seated cable row) all on machines, 2-3 sets, 10-12 reps.

•3 days/week (inclined walk on treadmill for 15 to 20 minutes).

My maintenance calories are 3000 according to bmr calculator (bmr calories are 2200, 3000 is on low to moderate activity level 1-3/week) and my diet is roughly of 2000 calories. Since i am in a big deficit to focus on a faster fat loss, i need to have high protein. I calculated through internet and it comes down 220-240gm/day in order to maintain my muscle mass but with this diet i am getting around 200gm/daily within 2000 calories and chatgpt says it’s fine. I’ll be also focusing on to drink 1-1.5l plain water and get 7-8h of sleep. For exercise, apart from gym, my daily goal will be to hit 10-12k steps by walking 30-60 minutes daily at night or in small amounts across the day.

What do you guys think? Do share your suggestions on what i can improve to faster this fat loss journey but with efficiency and preserving my muscle mass.",1,1768736775.0,AskFitnessIndia,2,1.0,False

1qg6k91,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qg6k91/my_ex_died_at_the_hands_of_another_man/,My ex died at the hands of another man.,"Throw away account. I will be as honest as I can be in the replies. Not going to give away too much information to protect myself and the families involved.

Well it finally happened and I'm pretty hurt over it. A few years ago my ex chose another man over me. We dated for years. She was sexually abused as a child. By who you may ask? Well you guess it. The man in question.

My ex was by no means a perfect person and exposed me to a lot of firsts. The most major one being never date an addict. She struggled for years during our relationship to stay clean and despite being very close to my family would occasionally relapse. Her family were addicts. Her friends, by an large, were addicts. And the guy in question was you guessed it an addict.

So how did we end up here and why do I feel like I need to get this off my chest? Well you see after a very long dating period, where in truth I refused to marry her until we both got our careers in order and she was clean for a prolonged period of time (never made it more than 3-5 months), we had a separation of sorts. During this period of time, we were not going to see other people and that was firmly agreed upon. She did it anyways and honestly if we broke up and she went to anyone else I would have been fine with it. To the credit of her family, they let me know that she was in fact seeing ""him"". I'll refer to ""him"" as Franklin from here on out.

See Franklin had a history of abuse. Child abuse. Domestic violence. Assaulting officers. Dealing drugs. If you can think of it Franklin did it. And somehow by the grace of God, or maybe some other power, Franklin never saw the inside of a jail cell for more than a day or two. Franklin starting seeing her when she was middle school age and he was in his mid twenties. No you're not reading that wrong, that is what actually happened. All throughout our relationship she hated this guy. Would actively help other victims that went through what she did and it was one of her more admirable qualities.

So how did she end up with Franklin? Honestly, beats me. I think she was secretly texting him and seeing him for a few months; despite what she told me after the fact. I lost it. I said some pretty nasty things and honestly I do not regret it. Me and ""her"", we will call her Samantha, were never really the same after that.

There was a brief moment where we met back up for coffee. Discussed life, our plans, and a potential future. As per usual, she promised to get clean. She promised to go to couple's therapy. She promised everything you could imagine not to lose me. A week later she claimed she spoke to her family and they told her to break up with me. I am fairly certain she spoke to Franklin.

See Franklin, was a dealer and in the end she chose drugs. She always found that lifestyle romantic, was extremely self destructive, and definitely had some issues I could not fix. It was doomed from the start more than likely. Despite getting a good education, she never used the degree. She cut ties with pretty much everyone in her life and just vanished.

Last year on a whim she reached out. I offered to be a friend to her. She looked horrible and sounded worse. She showed me some evidence that he was hurting her and was pressing charges. Everyone around her was worried, but she refused to meet up with anyone. She was embarrassed by her living situation and what she had become.

Somehow, I found it in my heart to forgive her. I could not just watch her suffer. We struck up a mild friendship and would exchange messages. I had no idea where she was living or what was really going on, but I felt for her. I did what I could in my limited capacity and tried to get her to reconnect with her family and friends. I pushed her to pursue pressing charges against Franklin who had now been arrested twice in connection with domestic violence against her specifically. She insisted they were no longer together and that she was going to change her life.

Two weeks later she was dead. She had OD'd and Franklin called 911. In his panic he tried to kill himself. Sadly, he was revived and she died pointlessly. No investigation. No funeral. Just another body quietly shuffled away by the system. Just another dead junkie. Her family does not even seem to want to look into the matter. Weirdly, it seems like some of them are on good terms with Franklin and give him sympathy over what happened.

To this day, I truly believe he killed her. Maybe not intentionally, but he is responsible for her death. I want him to face punishment. I want him to suffer. Instead, he gets pity points online for losing his loved one. Everyone showers him with sympathy. Life really is not fair.

Is there anything I could have done? Probably not, but I cannot help, but think about it sometimes. I miss the person she was. The person she could have been. There was something good in there at times. Her reaching out towards the end...it breaks me apart inside. While, I'm happy she died with us on good terms. I cannot help, but feel angry at her. Her choices led her to that moment. Yet...she did not deserve to die.

Has a nice outdoor and indoor section, decent coffee. I asked oh are u open late? and the lovely girl said; well theres no other cafes around here open late, so thought we'd give it a try and see. So if u do like a nightime coffee, please head on over & try them (so its viable to keep the later opening hrs), girl was super friendly & said theyre open until 10pm. Looks to be wine but also coffee and some pastries available too. Hoping it gets enuff business to keep the later hrs.

1qg6g1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1qg6g1e/i_am_scared_of_dying_at_16/,I am scared of dying at 16,Hello guys I just wanted to ask for help because it's better I do it without reaching to school and stuff coz I think they will make things worse so basically it all started last  2 years then my mom lost her job hut later on she found 2 jobs one was close to the city we were living in and the other was in cambridge but due to the fact that we weren't paying rent due to her job loss we got evicted however it would have all been avoided if she didn't get pregnant so basically even when me and my sister told her not to get pregnant coz even when she had a job we were struggling financially she was like it would be unfair to not give her husband which is my step dad a child of is own so she became pregnant so she didn't bother looking for a new place to rent before the eviction notice because of the sickness of the pregnancy and stuff so the council provided us with a Air bnb for 14 days  to give us time to find home a home but even at that my mom and my step dad took those 14 days for granted and didn't bother getting a place to rent so the 14 days was up and they moved us to the homeless shelter and in there it smelt like week and it smelt very bad but at least we had a roof over our head so when we were there that's when they took the whole home search serious and we found a good house but we were waiting for the paper work and everything to finish before we could finally pay for it to rent it and also my mom accepted the job in cambridge coz she heared that it was nhs and her friend told her how nhs job is great and this and that so then me and my older sister told her how it's not a great idea to move and how it would effect me too coz I was writing gcse and stuff that year and how moving to Cambridge wasn't a good idea and the transport system wasn't good and we didn't even have car then but she didn't listen and she listened to her husband we ended up renting a house in a place where there was no pedestrian walk just roads and also like no shops around to buy things and it was close to the river and it was winter so it was so cold there it would have all been if she went there and saw that tge place wasn't good and if she would hsve gone to the house we picked in the first place so then I wasn't going to school coz I couldn't to get the school bus I had to walk on the road with cars and trucks for 15 minutes coz no side walks and it was close to the river I didn't have a jacket and it was winter so I would rely on my school blazer and I would come home hungry but there will be no food in the house coz we had to pay 80 pounds to go to the city just to get food and then still pay more for food and then my mom stopped working coz she went on maternity leave early and she wasn't entitled to pay coz she hasn't worked a certain time so we were surviving on a 1 month salary for a couple of months and we still had to pay for electric and gas which was expensive and eventually we stopper paying for gas coz it was expensive and it didn't last long so we woukd boil hot water in a kettle just to shower plus I fell under depression coz I wanted to do well in school and I wasn't going and I just wanted to do well and we used to use those electric heaters for warmth but it ducked up all the electricity so we woukd turn it off and on so I don't want to make it long so I will just fast forward to I think a few month later when we got out of there coz I don't want to make it too long so the place we moved to again was far from the school so I almost didn't write my gcse exams but thank God the council provided me with taxi to pick me up and drop and ended up with a 77886653 in my gcse by teaching myself content  and I got into the school I wanted which was hills road but now my mom but my mom lost that job in cambridge coz during that time in that hour coz we couldn't get anything and we had to pay for taxi she tried getting a car to make it easy but I think she used one of her friend items without permission or smth I forgot so she lost that her job coz they reported her or smth I don't rember ever since then she hasn't been with a job even after them not paying her for I think 4 months during maternity leave and she don't have a job till now so I started making a website soon to be app called markwise it marks english essays and stuff and it's like Yr personalised teacher coz I myself struggled with English during those times so maybe I could change put story if u search it up u might not find it but if u want to use it u can ask me I will give you the link but now my mom plans on moving to New Zealand coz she got a job there so now I am scared of it happening again and it's even all abt that I am just done with life in general other things have been happening even before the two years and I feel when I cry out to God he just laughs at me  I plan on using coffee a heavy dose of coffee and sugar so i don't feel pain,1,1768736276.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

My girlfriend has very strong PMS. Probably PMDD and it is getting out of hand - anger issues (F26). Is there any other way to help her?

We spoke about medication and I agree. Hormonal medication is bad. 

Also antidepresives and other similar pills are bad and I am against it too.

She is currently getting some herbal tea but I see minimal difference during past year with herbs (tried many). 

We spoke about seeing doc but she doesn't want to do that.

Yoga is also no because she doesn't want to do that. She won't stop drinking coffee. She doesn't seem to do anything.

  
She is getting so angry about anything. Doesn't matter if I woke up late on weekend or used her phone charger. She gets really angry about everything. She hates herself, she hates her dogs... Not agreeing with her makes her looking like angry kid and even go and bang her head on wall. She is also in constant pain, can't even hug her. And after 14 days that terribly sucks she turns back from monster into loving and nice girlfriend for another 14 days. And this cycle repeats. It gets worse every year.

  
I am worried what will happen next year. Anyone has an idea how to help her?",1,1768736096.0,WomensHealth,2,0.67,False

I’ve had my machine 3 years and usually have it pretty well dialled. Use fresh beans and grind towards the finer end of the inner and out burr settings. Pressure is usually towards the top of the scale.

I was pulling a shot about a week ago and the was a pressure surge, the gasket blew out and was split.

I bought some cheaper gaskets from Amazon, had low pressure and gushing from the portafilter so though maybe I needed to OEM one from Sage. Bought direct from Sage, however the same issue occurred. I thought the shower screen might have been warped by the overpressure before the gasket blew. Bought a new shower screen from Sage. Still having the same issue.

I’m using fresh beans from Rave roasted on 12/1/26. I’ve tried grinding finer to #1 on inner and outer burrs. I’ve tried a range of doses between 18-20g. Nothing works, the shot just fires out as can be seen in the video.

I had a video call with a Sage customer service agent on live chat and they didn’t seem to know what would cause it. They just said I’d need to send it off to Coffee Classics to be fixed.

Before I do this, has anyone had an issue like this or may know what is causing it? I’m fairly handy so I’m happy to order parts from Coffee Classics and fit them myself, but I’m not sure where to start from here.

1qg6dlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductHunters/comments/1qg6dlg/i_analyzed_5000_google_reviews_across_11/,"I analyzed 5,000+ Google reviews across 11 businesses. The patterns are wild. Drop your link and I'll do yours free.","I've been pulling patterns from Google reviews for the past few weeks. Not reading them one by one, but finding what businesses actually miss.

Some things that made me go ""wait, what?""

The Hoxton Chicago charges $400/night for rooms where the L train literally shakes the walls. Fifteen reviews mention it. Zero soundproofing. Zero discount. Just... ignored.

Dalla Terra Wine Bar has one manager: ""the guy in a suit"", mentioned in 8 reviews as rude and dismissive. That's not a training issue. That's a personnel issue killing a 4.3-star business.

Wall Two 80 has customers saying ""best coffee in Balaclava"" 24 times. Their Google Business description? Generic. They're not using the exact language that drives local search.

PureGym Liverpool: broken AC for 30+ days, gym hitting 30 degrees, management ghosted members on timeline. People canceling memberships and writing 1-star reviews about being ignored.

Razza Pizza: people drive 45 minutes and call it ""life-changing."" But 12 reviews say burnt crusts at $30/pie. The messaging says ""artisan wood-fired."" The reviews says ""inconsistent execution."" That's a positioning-reality gap.

What I'm learning:

1. Voice of customer is sitting in plain sight

South Lake Chalet guests mention ""walkability to beach"" 22 times. It's not in their listing title. That's the primary decision factor and they're not leading with it.

2. Surface complaints hide the real opportunities

""This gym is crowded"" = ""not enough bench presses at peak hours"" (12 mentions)

""This hotel is loud"" = ""L train rooms need discount pricing""

The real insight is always one layer deeper.

3. Differentiation already exists in reviews

Snowy Owl Cafe: ""Authentic Peruvian empanadas"" mentioned 12x. That's differentiation in a saturated coffee market.

Barry's WeHo: Instructor playlist curation mentioned 15x. That's a specific competitive advantage, not just ""good music.""

Most businesses never extract these positioning anchors because they're reading for sentiment, not strategy.

Why I'm doing this:

I'm working on a system that pulls this intelligence from reviews automatically. Analyzed 11 businesses, 5,000+ reviews so far.

Workflow is automated, but I manually QA every report to make sure insights are actually useful (not just sentiment scores and quote dumps).

Trying to answer: What positioning should you lead with? What customer language should be in copy? What operational fix has highest ROI? What's the real reason customers choose competitors?

Currently works with Google Business Profile reviews. Planning to add more platforms (Yelp, TripAdvisor, Airbnb, Amazon, Reddit, etc.) based on what people actually want, trying to avoid building features no one needs.

Drop a Google Maps link + what you want to know:

Why customers choose competitors

What language should be in messaging

What differentiation exists but isn't leveraged

What operational fixes would move the needle

I'll run it through the workflow and share the patterns.

This kind of “modern chaos” is embodied in the music of the group USHIMITSU. At the core of their sound lies digital hardcore, while their lyrics are generously infused with sarcasm and humor. What stands out in particular is the presence of a member who never speaks—404ERROR. To uncover what kind of mysterious group USHIMITSU really is, we at OTOTOY conducted an interview with them. We spoke with the members 404ERROR, ENMA, NAN, and EVE, as well as with the group’s producer, Hashiba Takanari, and attempted to get closer to understanding the project’s fundamental essence.

https://preview.redd.it/cfaen9z0d3eg1.jpg?width=2100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba9424dae616c13e21e592c546d3006a5ed5e995

With such an unusual performer as 404ERROR in their lineup, USHIMITSU may well be the craziest group on the scene today. Their sound can first and foremost be described with the word “radical.” Chaos and humor, irony and anger. Their gripping performances, which weave all of this into elements of a show, are certain to deliver a serious shock to the contemporary music scene. The curtain rises on the circus of madness created by USHIMITSU. And if you want to experience it for yourself, now is the perfect time.

# “There were rumors going around that ‘some insane group had appeared.’”

*— Well then, I would like to begin the interview, but, you know, this girl…*

**Hashiba Takanari**: Ah, you can see her?

*— Ah… yes. Quite clearly.*

**Hashiba**: Oh, that's good. Sometimes people mistakenly think they’ve “seen something they weren’t supposed to see” (laughs). This is our member, 404ERROR. She doesn't usually speak, but she communicates through gestures. She conveys all of her emotions extremely well, so please give her a warm welcome!

**404ERROR**: *(Seems to be smiling gently.)*

[404ERROR](https://preview.redd.it/coa1mi22d3eg1.jpg?width=2100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42cfa3f490d1e7959761824a91671d785d4e33b6)

*— I see…! All right, today I would like to talk with you about what kind of group USHIMITSU actually is. To begin with, could you tell us how this project got started?*

**Hashiba**: It all began when I announced auditions to recruit members, but no one showed up, and I found myself in a bind. So I started approaching people directly on the street. And around the time ENMA and NAN joined the group, 404ERROR suddenly appeared behind me out of nowhere. At that point, I didn't even know her name. But from then on, whenever I went to, say, a concert venue, she'd always be there. It has now been eight months since we met. Perhaps she simply wants to be wherever music is playing.

**404ERROR**: *(Seems to give a thumbs-up.)*

*— I see… Then please tell us how each of the members joined the group. ENMA-san was the first one, if I understand correctly?*

**Hashiba**: Yes. Before this, ENMA was part of another group. It was something idol-like, but their rock-band-style live performances were incredibly cool, and when I was thinking about whom to invite into the group, ENMA was the first person who came to mind.

**ENMA**: I remember we talked about it at Renoir Coffee.

**Hashiba**: I had already been involved in various projects myself, but this time I wanted to work with people who were closer to vocalists or rock band members.

[ENMA](https://preview.redd.it/b6odcas3d3eg1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec88ee72e71f917f5f300db7b351328bdc41de12)

*— Were you already acquainted with NAN?*

**NAN**: Yes. We had crossed paths at live shows. Back then, we were just acquaintances. I had also been an idol before, but about a year ago my group disbanded. Originally, I was one of those prejudiced against idols, so the cute style didn't appeal to me—I wanted to do something cool.

**Hashiba**: We met for a small reason, talked for a bit, and I suggested, “Why don’t we make music together?” I remember discussing it at Komeda Coffee.

**EVE**: It's always some kind of coffee shop (laughs).

[NAN](https://preview.redd.it/yud43l05d3eg1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3149c8ecbba35fb74b13672a1f6b935ce900009)

*— And what about 404ERROR? How did she end up joining the group?*

**Hashiba**: Well… it was less a matter of “joining” and more a matter of “appearing.”

*— What kind of presence is she as a member?*

**ENMA**: We don't know where she came from, nor what she does in her everyday life. We are still trying to solve that mystery.

*— Do you interact in your private lives?*

**Hashiba**: Does she even have a “private life” to begin with? In any case, we spend quite a lot of time together. We travel to various places, after all. Sometimes, though, she suddenly disappears after a performance. But recently, little by little, we've started to understand things like, “It seems she is smiling right now,” or “It seems she doesn't like this,” and so on. She seems to be in a good mood today.

**404ERROR**: *(Seems to give a thumbs-up.)*

*— 404ERROR is something of a symbol of USHIMITSU, isn't she?*

**Hashiba**: Exactly. Everyone is always surprised, and even the staff are sometimes left in shock.

*— So that means EVE-san was the last to join, completing the current lineup.*

**Hashiba**: I was already acquainted with EVE beforehand as well. She had even performed at events organized by my previous group, so we knew each other. She personally produced her own idol group and led everyone herself, taking on the role of leader. And I really liked those abilities of hers and her leadership strength. Around that time, her project had just come to an end and she was thinking about what to do next, and I sensed potential in her and invited her to join. She joined the group on May 31, at our solo concert titled “+++++” at Shibuya GRIT.

**EVE**: At first it was just a casual invitation, like, “Wanna give it a try?” And I had already heard quite a few rumors about them, so I thought, “Well, all right.”

[EVE](https://preview.redd.it/4cz4n696d3eg1.jpg?width=2100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=741e236492816813e485af69a69f83e8fe4cb9d0)

*— By the way, what kind of rumors were those?*

**EVE**: Of course, everyone was talking about 404ERROR-chan. And even though I didn't have many chances to see them live, there were rumors going around that “some insane group had appeared.”

*— Well, I can definitely understand that (laughs).*

**404ERROR**: *(Seems to be smiling sweetly.)*

**EVE**: She looks pleased (laughs).

[Hashiba Takanari](https://preview.redd.it/sgtpkhj7d3eg1.jpg?width=2100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f36d68eaafdf833a633f495c108d5302cd8cf7a7)

# “It feels like we’re going against the modern era of 'compliance,' destroying everything within our reach.”

*— You present yourselves as ‘3 MCs + 1 performer.’ So, does that mean 404ERROR is the performer?*

**Hashiba**: For convenience, to make it easier to understand, we labeled her as a “performer.” She is the one who dances and moves to the music. If we're talking about genre, it's probably its own genre called ""404ERROR.""

*— Was this kind of structure something you had planned from the very beginning?*

**Hashiba**: Not at all. It all started with a simple desire to make music, and we were creating it all together. Then suddenly this being called 404ERROR appeared, and we were like, “What do we do? She doesn't sing or talk.” And it ended up that she started dancing. It was pure coincidence, but she ultimately became a symbol of the group, for which I'm very grateful to her.

[404ERROR](https://preview.redd.it/t1bvrzv8d3eg1.jpg?width=2100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd3d5f2f4a663eccd7915849a1e301d41a46b3cc)

*— As for your musical style, it's largely based on a digital-hardcore-like sound, but how did you arrive at that direction?*

**Hashiba**: Everyone shared the same desire: “to make something new and cool.” We wanted to create a future that would follow after the era of rock idols. So we decided to push ourselves beyond our limits and try to create something that had never been done before. We shifted toward digital, removed moshing and crowd surfing, and began experimenting with ethnic musical instruments and elements of classical music. We want to create a sound that can resonate with people all over the world. By experimentally implementing something new like this, it feels like we're creating our own single, cohesive world out of it.

*— Watching your videos, you can really feel the powerful energy of your performance. Was that something you already had from the start?*

**Hashiba**: We went through insanely intense training. I think it was made possible precisely because of our rigorous rehearsals. For about two weeks, we spent six hours every single day in a live music club, refining the choreography and running full rehearsals. We needed to create entirely new forms of expression, so there were no ready-made answers—just constant trial and error.

**NAN**: The training really was insane. I think I became a completely different person compared to who I was when I first joined the group. Even the way I got into the groove of the songs was different than usual, so there was just so much to learn. Using harsh words that I wouldn't normally say was also something new for me… But at the same time, it was exciting to feel a new “me” gradually emerge.

*— Did you feel a sense of liberation while doing that?*

**NAN**: Yes. It was fun, and I learned how to vent a wide range of emotions. At first, even saying the word “die” was difficult for me, but gradually I learned to say it naturally. I had never expressed anger before, so I started by directing it at myself. I aimed it at my past mistakes, at thoughts like “I'm probably completely worthless,” and expressed it that way.

[ENMA](https://preview.redd.it/grvfdl3ad3eg1.jpg?width=2100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b0cc933f829061ea6cece0e0781190a4fa5fab3)

*— I see. And how was it for the other members?*

**EVE**: Well, I have a fiery temperament by nature (laughs). It was a lot of fun. It was scary to join an already established group with such a crazy schedule, but thanks to those harsh conditions, I became stronger. At first I sang so badly that they told me, “You won't be singing,” and I was like, “Are you serious?” But somehow, I managed to push through.

*— USHIMITSU’s lyrics are quite harsh as well, aren't they?*

**Hashiba**: Yes. I write them too, but I often incorporate trendy expressions from the members’ everyday conversations. For example, “Hye\~” and similar cute little phrases. If I rely only on my perception as a 40-year-old dude, it will sound old-fashioned, so I always ask for the members' opinions. I check with them, asking, “Do these lyrics sound like an old geezer wrote them?” and we refine it together, taking everyone’s views into account.

**EVE**: I was the one who said “Hye\~,” and they added it to the song just for fun. It's absolutely terrible (laughs).

*— So you really listen to the members’ input?*

**Hashiba**: Yes. They always speak frankly and say, “This is good,” or “This is bad.” The only exception is NAN-chan, who sometimes expresses it silently, just through her facial expression. In those moments, I understand, “Ah, so this won't do,” and I go back to fix it. A lot can be communicated through expressions alone.

*— What was the audience’s reaction like at your first live shows?*

**ENMA**: People were in shock. Even we ourselves were thinking: ""What on earth was that?"". Usually, audiences come expecting something like, “Singing, dancing, yay!”, but then 404ERROR appears, and everyone goes, “Huh!?” The shows began with that surprise and ended with it.

**Hashiba**: In order to leave people standing there with their jaws dropped like that, we toured various places, actively promoting ourselves. And thanks to the support of our audience, at our solo concert in May of this year, we felt that people were gradually starting to recognize us, thinking, “Yeah, this is cool!”

[NAN](https://preview.redd.it/qnuu315bd3eg1.jpg?width=2100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ba1407b3f361d21b37eb3ce40677a52ad49d543)

*— So at first, the audience didn't even know how to react to you.*

**Hashiba**: Exactly. But after about half a year, at our solo concert people were able to relax and simply enjoy the performance. Of course, at joint shows there are still people who get confused, but at our solo concerts, the audience consists of people who consciously want to immerse themselves in and enjoy this world, so it feels like we are really managing to reach people. Even at our solo concerts, our performances are largely centered on what's happening on stage—it feels as though the audience is “watching a show.” Because of that, I think the world of USHIMITSU comes across very clearly even at shows shared with other groups. That said, sometimes we end up using so much smoke that you can’t see anything, or cranking the volume up so loud that people say, “Earplugs are mandatory” (laughs). All kinds of one-off incidents happen quite often.

*— Please tell us about your songs as well. Starting September 17th, your GOTH""AM"" CIRCUS TOURs begins, and along with it, you are starting the sale of your conceptual demo mini-album ""GOTH'AM' CIRCUS,"" available for purchase only at venues.*

**Hashiba**: With the name “GOTH'AM',” we wanted to convey the powerful and vicious atmosphere that Gotham City from Batman gives off. By infusing it with a circus flair, we tried to create a new kind of gothic atmosphere. I think both *Gotham* and *circus* are images that naturally resonate with the world our group expresses.

[EVE](https://preview.redd.it/zlcc14bcd3eg1.jpg?width=2100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c12e1fd126959580b32365af2d0102f52a98d82)

*— How do you envision the image of the first track, the title song “GOTH'AM'”?*

**NAN**: It's a special song—it takes its name from the tour, and for me personally it also became a new challenge. Its lyrics are even more ""vicious"": right from the start, the song uses words like “trash,” and even “vomit” (laughs). It feels like we’re going against the modern era of “compliance,” destroying everything within our reach. There are a lot of harsh words in this song, but precisely because it's a work of art, I can allow myself to say things that I'd never say in everyday life. I think that's exactly where the appeal of performance lies.

**Hashiba**: The word ""gothic"" evokes associations with European aesthetics, doesn't it? Once, I came across a playlist by an Italian rapper on YouTube, and it was so gothic and cool. And I thought, “What if I made it even more hard-hitting? That would be interesting!” And that's how this song came to be.

*— There is also the line “Clean, proper, beautiful” in the lyrics.*

**Hashiba**: That's my image of the members. They always look so neat and cool. I wrote it both as a sign of respect toward them and as a reproach to myself. After all, I'm the complete opposite: sloppy, dirty… basically as bad as it gets (laughs).

*— The second song is “×” (“Batsu”). USHIMITSU’s song titles are quite distinctive as well.*

**Hashiba**: Yes. I wanted to do everything in a symbolic style. You know how foreigners sometimes get tattoos with Japanese words like “soba,” without understanding their meaning? I thought that, to them, Japanese probably looks like a collection of symbols. That's the kind of effect I wanted to achieve here.

*— What, in your opinion, should listeners pay special attention to in “×” (“Batsu”)?*

**EVE**: I like everything about it, but live, the moment that really stands out is when, during the line “Kami yo, Tenbatsu wo” (“God, deliver punishment”), 404ERROR-chan is lit by a spotlight and starts to resemble the Virgin Mary. The song looks comical, yet at the same time it carries a very strong message.

**404ERROR**: *(Smiles with a proud look.)*

[Hashiba Takanari](https://preview.redd.it/5q8ydbbdd3eg1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5db176b055f2751d2bb706813581abf43f7be1b9)

# “Packed with the spirit of USHIMITSU.”

*— What about the next song, “洗礼 yeAH!!×2”?*

**Hashiba**: It has a bit of a gyaru vibe—a kind of party song that lifts your spirits. I wanted it to feel bright. For example, there are lines like “Yay!” or “No gyaru nerds at heart allowed” (laughs). For us, it plays the role of a catchy song like that.

*— So it's a song in the gyaru spirit?*

**Hashiba**: Gyaru are so positive, and I like that.

**NAN**: At shows, it feels very different from the other songs, and I like that contrast.

*— And “Hye\~” shows up there as well.*

**EVE**: I once wrote “Hye\~” on social media, and everyone else started teasing me about it nonstop (laughs). I thought it would die down eventually, and then suddenly it ends up in the lyrics of a new song (laughs).

*— Maybe that will turn into another song as well.*

**EVE**: Yes (laughs). I'm more careful now—if I blurt something out, it immediately turns into a song.

https://preview.redd.it/tkon1obed3eg1.jpg?width=2100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=416936bf34460a92060c75a285f9d68432c93929

*— And what about “NO SCENCE NO THANX”?*

**Hashiba**: It's the fastest of all our songs. The BPM is over 235.

**EVE**: And it feels like 404ERROR-chan gets especially fired up during it. At that “Yaaay!” moment, she looks like she's having a lot of fun.

**404ERROR**: *(Seems to be smiling cheerfully.)*

**ENMA**: And the choreography there aren't like in other songs—a completely different atmosphere.

**Hashiba**: In the chorus, there's even something like reggaeton, and the dancing is insanely cool, so be sure to see it live.

https://preview.redd.it/vbjjrggfd3eg1.jpg?width=2100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d7b4cfe972c0de06d152e353c5f0be6408014159

*— And the final song is “DADA PIERROT.”*

**Hashiba**: When I look at the world, I see so many people about whom I think, “How ridiculous,” that I wanted to gather all of those feelings into a single track. There are so many people who dig their own graves, people who drown in a thirst for approval, people who lose their true selves. In this song, I'm being ironic about all of that, but the song itself is very fun. Hey, 404ERROR, you think so too, right?

**404ERROR**: *(Seems to nod.)*

**Hashiba**: It seems she likes it. In fact, this was the very first song I wrote for “GOTH'AM'CIRCUS.” It was the first track with which we began shaping the concept. I put a lot of thought into properly conveying the circus atmosphere—it even starts with the sound of a trumpet. In the end, I think that precisely because it was created first, it ended up being a perfect fit for the finale.

**NAN**: The lyrics make you think, “Yes, people like that really do exist,” and singing while laying those words over the rhythm is fun. The lyrics have some ironic moments, but towards the end there’s also a kind of rap section, and that's entertaining.

**Hashiba**: After all, Pierrot has that duality, doesn’t he? He both laughs and cries. Through that duality, I satirize people you can easily encounter in real life.

**ENMA**: It's interesting. The music alone sounds conceptual and circus-like, but the lyrics are packed with the spirit of USHIMITSU. And that's great.

https://preview.redd.it/yas6bbcgd3eg1.jpg?width=2100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b94297db8db1627b06acc75f4c4a2ff2ccbf5ca

*— You are starting the GOTH""AM""CIRCUS TOUR through Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka. What can you say about it?*

**EVE**: The tour has a clearly defined concept, and we're going into it with new songs. Up until now, it felt like we were keeping everything under wraps—we had never had such a clear and understandable concept before. But now, the release, the merch—everything feels like it’s coming together as a cohesive set, and I’m already looking forward to the result.

*— And finally, what is USHIMITSU striving for?*

**Hashiba**: Well… I recently lost my passport, so I had to get a new one, and it would be nice if I could actually make use of it.

*— So you are aiming to step onto the international stage as well?*

**Hashiba**: Yes. I think it would be amazing if the world could discover 404ERROR-chan and the others. I would love to see overseas audiences staring in astonishment at USHIMITSU, mouths hanging open. Besides, we’ve already done quite a bit of driving around Japan, so now I’d like to try some other form of transportation.

*— Are there any concrete plans for going abroad yet?*

**Hashiba**: Not yet. But we're always open to offers. Our music video “屍BONE骸TOBE成JOBUTU仏” has already surpassed 100,000 views, and there are many comments from overseas. It would be great if that could take us somewhere outside Japan. I would love to spread the word “JOBUTU” (“attaining nirvana” / “rest in peace”) around the world, until it becomes as familiar as “ramen.” Our tour will be starting soon, and at the end of the year we have a large solo concert scheduled for New Year’s Eve. From here on, we'll only keep building momentum.

Chapter 1

“The Tribute”

POV Amelia

I wake up sore and bruised and struggle to get out of bed to report for my kitchen duties.

I have always been the omega runt of our pack, which means I’m regularly bullied, beaten up and tormented.

Omegas are the lowest rank, and when I caught the eye of our Alpha Sebastian, it felt like things were looking up.



I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I waltz down to his office, excited to see him. 

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, handsome,” I smile.

“You will address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘I told you he was an asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“The Luna found out about our affair, you’re going to the Dark Howlers pack as a tribute.”

“I’m not a virgin. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Then you shouldn’t have thrown yourself at me,” he growls.

“You told me if I slept with you, you would make me your luna,” I whimper.

“Watch your mouth, Amelia. Your lies will get us both killed. Don’t be selfish and take me down with you,” Alpha Sebastian snarls.

“Please, Sebastian, I love you. Don’t send me away to be killed,” I plead.

For one moment, his demeanor changes, and his eyes light up at the sight of me.

Then he turns stone cold again.

“Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says, scowling.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

“I’m sure we’ll be dead before the next blood moon,” I tell her.

‘It’s tomorrow. Stay alive long enough, and we can escape and find a pack that wants us.’

“If they knew what we are, no one would want us,” I tell Athena.

I was born with a cursed wolf. The healer covers me in painful markings to stop Athena from taking control of me, but the markings wear off and need to be constantly redone.

The power of the blood moon gives Athena a chance to break free of the runes so we can shift and run free.

My mood lifts with the chance of freedom.

I’m packing my bag when Luna Celest grabs me by the neck and lifts me off my feet.

“You little slut. How dare you throw yourself at my husband? If I ever see you again, I’ll slit your throat,” she says, tossing me into a wall.

I pull myself slowly up, feeling the pain shoot across my lower back from the impact. 

As soon as I get outside, some of the kids I went to high school with come to see me off, throwing rocks at me.

“You’re dead now. Obsidian will have your head,” they all yell and laugh.

‘John, Keith, and Maria are now added to my kill list,’ Athena declares.

I use my bag as a shield when a big black SUV pulls up, and one of the kids misses me and hits the vehicle.

A large, monstrous man steps out, grabs Keith by the throat, and snaps his neck, and gestures for me to get in.

He throws Keith’s lifeless body on the ground.

“We are so dead,” I tell Athena.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you were five.” He plays with my hair, pulling my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh.” Is all I manage to get out.

“Why are you full of bruises, and what do these runes mean?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.

It’s a two hour drive to Kaden’s pack. Every minute I get more paranoid that I’m going to die.

“There’s practically steam coming out of your ears, little wolf. Obsidian will not harm you,” he says.

He will once he finds out we’re not a virgin.

My chest starts to tighten, and I feel like I can’t catch my breath.

Kaden moves closer and tries rubbing my back, but I wince from the fresh injury. 

“Relax, little one,” he says, pouring me a glass of wine, and I gulp it back.

“Woah, slow down, Amelia,” he says, taking the glass away.

I’m practically squished up against the door, trying to stop him from touching me.

He notices and moves away.

“Amelia, what is going on? What are you not telling me?”

I remain silent.

The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll shove us in the dungeon and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open, and a large man with icy blue eyes and black hair to his chin steps in. His face is emotionless.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

The air shifts in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head, and Obsidian loses it. He trashes everything in the office before my eyes, and I don’t move a muscle. I sit as still as possible in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don't answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man that you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say, avoiding the whole blood moon conversation.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

Trying to shut my brain down from overthinking.

I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” He asks.

“The healers draw them on. They think it keeps everyone safe from me,” I say.

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the blood moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don't want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘Your so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over you face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I saw him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she's unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Why did you fucking kill my Luna?” he growls.

“She grabbed me by the throat and threatened to kill me,” I say.

“Fuck, I should have told her about you,” he barks.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“You said she grabbed you by the throat and threatened to kill you. Who was this girl?” Kaden asks.

“She’s been dealt with,” I mutter.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”",1,1768735290.0,novelsfree,2,1.0,False

Chapter 1

“The Tribute”

POV Amelia

I wake up sore and bruised and struggle to get out of bed to report for my kitchen duties.

I have always been the omega runt of our pack, which means I’m regularly bullied, beaten up and tormented.

Omegas are the lowest rank, and when I caught the eye of our Alpha Sebastian, it felt like things were looking up.



I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I waltz down to his office, excited to see him. 

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, handsome,” I smile.

“You will address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘I told you he was an asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“The Luna found out about our affair, you’re going to the Dark Howlers pack as a tribute.”

“I’m not a virgin. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Then you shouldn’t have thrown yourself at me,” he growls.

“You told me if I slept with you, you would make me your luna,” I whimper.

“Watch your mouth, Amelia. Your lies will get us both killed. Don’t be selfish and take me down with you,” Alpha Sebastian snarls.

“Please, Sebastian, I love you. Don’t send me away to be killed,” I plead.

For one moment, his demeanor changes, and his eyes light up at the sight of me.

Then he turns stone cold again.

“Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says, scowling.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

“I’m sure we’ll be dead before the next blood moon,” I tell her.

‘It’s tomorrow. Stay alive long enough, and we can escape and find a pack that wants us.’

“If they knew what we are, no one would want us,” I tell Athena.

I was born with a cursed wolf. The healer covers me in painful markings to stop Athena from taking control of me, but the markings wear off and need to be constantly redone.

The power of the blood moon gives Athena a chance to break free of the runes so we can shift and run free.

My mood lifts with the chance of freedom.

I’m packing my bag when Luna Celest grabs me by the neck and lifts me off my feet.

“You little slut. How dare you throw yourself at my husband? If I ever see you again, I’ll slit your throat,” she says, tossing me into a wall.

I pull myself slowly up, feeling the pain shoot across my lower back from the impact. 

As soon as I get outside, some of the kids I went to high school with come to see me off, throwing rocks at me.

“You’re dead now. Obsidian will have your head,” they all yell and laugh.

‘John, Keith, and Maria are now added to my kill list,’ Athena declares.

I use my bag as a shield when a big black SUV pulls up, and one of the kids misses me and hits the vehicle.

A large, monstrous man steps out, grabs Keith by the throat, and snaps his neck, and gestures for me to get in.

He throws Keith’s lifeless body on the ground.

“We are so dead,” I tell Athena.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you were five.” He plays with my hair, pulling my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh.” Is all I manage to get out.

“Why are you full of bruises, and what do these runes mean?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.

It’s a two hour drive to Kaden’s pack. Every minute I get more paranoid that I’m going to die.

“There’s practically steam coming out of your ears, little wolf. Obsidian will not harm you,” he says.

He will once he finds out we’re not a virgin.

My chest starts to tighten, and I feel like I can’t catch my breath.

Kaden moves closer and tries rubbing my back, but I wince from the fresh injury. 

“Relax, little one,” he says, pouring me a glass of wine, and I gulp it back.

“Woah, slow down, Amelia,” he says, taking the glass away.

I’m practically squished up against the door, trying to stop him from touching me.

He notices and moves away.

“Amelia, what is going on? What are you not telling me?”

I remain silent.

The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll shove us in the dungeon and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open, and a large man with icy blue eyes and black hair to his chin steps in. His face is emotionless.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

The air shifts in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head, and Obsidian loses it. He trashes everything in the office before my eyes, and I don’t move a muscle. I sit as still as possible in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don't answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man that you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say, avoiding the whole blood moon conversation.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

Trying to shut my brain down from overthinking.

I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” He asks.

“The healers draw them on. They think it keeps everyone safe from me,” I say.

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the blood moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don't want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘Your so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over you face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I saw him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she's unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Why did you fucking kill my Luna?” he growls.

“She grabbed me by the throat and threatened to kill me,” I say.

“Fuck, I should have told her about you,” he barks.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say, avoiding the whole blood moon conversation.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

Trying to shut my brain down from overthinking.

I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” He asks.

“The healers draw them on. They think it keeps everyone safe from me,” I say.

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the blood moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don't want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘Your so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over you face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I saw him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she's unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Why did you fucking kill my Luna?” he growls.

“She grabbed me by the throat and threatened to kill me,” I say.

“Fuck, I should have told her about you,” he barks.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“You said she grabbed you by the throat and threatened to kill you. Who was this girl?” Kaden asks.

“She’s been dealt with,” I mutter.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

We live in a large regional town in England and booked appointments in advance.

An underwhelming experience across all brands:

German Brand 1: Very young salesperson, absolutely lovely and trying their best - but a considerable lack of training. Also, didn’t have access to any of their internal systems or even their own desk. Very unsure about vehicle specs or delivery times. Demo vehicle was coated in dog hair in the cabin and caked in mud. Pretty poor considering they knew we were coming and a terrible first impression.

German Brand 2: No introduction from the gent, just gave us the keys for a test drive and a scan of my licence. Came back from solo test drive, he was engaged with another couple. Waited 30 mins, still not available. Gave the keys back and haven’t heard from him since. 

German Brand 3: Lovely sales staff, good coffee, accompanied test drive of only 10 minutes. Upon returning, we were handed over to the man in the glass box for the hard sell on the specific demo we had just driven, not the new model and spec we actually wanted. Wouldn’t shut up about the £500 deposit to secure the car. The final 10 minutes really tainted the previous 60.

Swedish Brand: Stupidly disorganised salesperson. Lost the keys for the demo and eventually found them in their pocket. Then the EV battery was flat. They eventually got it hooked up the fast charger whilst we drank room temperature water. Car was filthy inside and out and only 10% charge limited test drive 

Salesperson was not at all phased and was insistent on us meeting their “senior business manager” upstairs.

Some cracking cars and a good experience to test drive 4 premium vehicles in quick succession, but blow me down, the bar must be low in car sales in 2026.",39,1768734609.0,CarTalkUK,46,0.87,False

I've been banging my head against the wall lately trying to build a dispatch system for a driver fleet. The main issue was cost—services like Google Maps or Mapbox wanted ridiculous money ($50k+) once we hit a certain volume of matrix calls.

I decided to try and roll my own self-hosted microservice using Node and PostGIS, but I kept hitting the ""Thundering Herd"" problem where too many GPS pings at once would lock up the DB.

After a lot of trial and error (and way too much coffee), I finally got it working stable. I built a Node.js buffering layer that catches the pings and batches them into transactions so Postgres doesn't choke.

**The Result (Screenshot attached):** I just stress-tested it with 100,000 points. It ingested everything in about 4.7 seconds (roughly 21k writes/sec). The craziest part is that I swapped the standard radius search for the KNN operator (`<->`), so I'm still getting dispatch queries back in \~30-50ms even while the DB is getting hammered.

I'm pretty stoked on it, so I wanted to share the numbers. Has anyone else tried pushing PostGIS this hard, or did you all just switch to Redis/Tile38?

Has an in-house cafe subko and the location is an advantage.

2. White Crow Books and Coffee, Jio World Drive, Bandra.

Not the biggest, but still a great 
collection of contemporary releases. Also a whole section for penguin classics and vintage classics? Chef's kiss. Has an in-house cafe too.

You'll get your popular releases in contemporary literature, and good indian  literature collection; but majorly all contemporary. Disappointed to not have much more of classics here. But there's a half of the store dedicated to non-fiction, if that's your cup of tea. 

4. Granth Book Store, Juhu

Mostly caters to latest and popular releases, and handy mix of generic classics and non fiction. Not the most widest catalogs, but worth a look in.

During the meeting, the financial adviser spots antipsychotic medications (or anything else that is embarrassing but not illegal) on the client's coffee table. Would that observation be subject to confidentiality?

I vaguely recall a QBank question from a third party provider (Kaplan maybe?) that suggested that it would not be subject to confidentiality, but wanted to check since I did not find anything to this effect in the CFAI materials.

# The Teacher

Morning hit me like a bad punchline. I woke up too early, too cold, and with about three brain cells firing, all of them screaming at me to crawl back under the covers and stay there. I ignored them and brewed a pot of coffee that tasted more like battery acid than beans. It was the only thing capable of jumpstarting my heart.

I shouldn’t have been thinking about work, but the math was already running in the back of my head. It wasn’t sentiment. I don’t do the whole inspiring mentor act. It was calculation. I wondered if Daniel had actually slept or spent the night tracing the cracks in his ceiling. I made a mental note to requisition a specific grade of insulated fiber for Tasha, since the standard issue gloves were already starting to char at the fingertips. I remembered the way Gabe flinched when the turrets whined, and how Sofia whispered to her sleeve like she was briefing a field agent.

They were stuck in my head like unsolved equations. It didn’t feel like affection, but it felt like responsibility. That scared me more than any villain could.

I drove to the Academy with my hands white knuckled on the wheel. The sky overhead was a flat, bruised gray, the exact shade of the school’s annex walls. A place built to look prestigious on a brochure but designed to feel like a high security ward in person. I spent the drive rehearsing a lecture on survival, only to realize halfway there that I was starting to sound like an optimist. Disgusting.

When I pulled up to the annex, they were already waiting. Tasha was leaning against the brickwork, blue sparks dancing across her knuckles in an erratic, nervous rhythm. Gabe was flipping his coin, his eyes darting around the courtyard, scanning for threats that hadn’t manifested yet. Livia was on the concrete, her pencil moving so fast it looked like she was trying to dissect the building with graphite. Daniel sat on the edge of a planter, staring at his scuffed boots.

And then there was Leo. Or rather, the empty space near the door where I only realized he was standing once I looked directly at him. He was like a smudge on a lens, a shadow with bad posture. I gave him a nod. He didn’t return it. He just was.

“Inside,” I grunted, my voice cutting through the damp morning air. “Let’s go disappoint some board members.”

I’d seen an email from the Dean sent at 01:00 AM, three warning flags and a subject line announcing that the Review had been moved to today. He wanted them presentable. Too late for that. I didn’t have presentable. I had a girl who talked to spiders, a human concussion, a blood manipulator with a guilt complex, and a boy who was basically a walking void.

But they were here. And for Class F, that was half the battle.

\- - - - 

# Daniel

I felt the heat before I even heard his footsteps.

It hit me like a dry, stifling wave, smelling of ozone and expensive sandalwood. Then the light came, far too bright, washing out the edges of the hallway until the world felt bleached. I kept my eyes on my shoes, noticing one lace was frayed, while a voice far too loud and far too practiced for an audience called out.

“Hey, little bro.”

I wanted the floor to open up and swallow me, but the only thing that moved was the heat in my face. My nose gave that sharp, familiar pinch. When I wiped it, my hand came away smeared with dark red.

Jerrod stepped closer, and the temperature in the hall rose another five degrees. He leaned in, dropping his voice to a mock whisper that he made sure his friends could still hear.

“You’re an embarrassment, Dan. You know that? You could’ve gotten into a real class if you’d just tried. But no. You had to end up in the freak bin. The only guy in the Academy who bleeds because he’s nervous.”

He let out a bark of a laugh. It felt like a slap.

That was when the shame stopped being hot and turned cold. I felt the next drop of blood slide from my nostril, but it didn’t drip onto my shirt. It stopped. I wasn’t thinking about spells or training. I was just angry. The world went silent. Jerrod’s golden aura didn’t matter anymore. All I could feel was the iron in the fluid.

The drop didn’t just float. It shuddered. It began to contract, pulling inward, getting tighter and denser until it wasn’t a liquid anymore. It was a solid shard of ruby colored glass. A needle.

And then, slowly, the point rotated. It aimed itself right at Jerrod’s laughing, golden eye.

\- - - - 

# The Teacher

I’d seen enough. Jerrod was still grinning, too busy enjoying his own light to notice the jagged splinter of blood aiming for his pupil. I stepped into the hallway, projecting nothing but pure, unadulterated boredom.

“Leave.”

The word cut through the laughter like a razor. Jerrod turned, blinking, the glow around his shoulders pulsing with irritation.

“Excuse me?” he asked, looking at me like I was a janitor interrupting a performance.

“You heard me,” I said, taking a slow sip of my coffee. “This hallway is for students with work to do. Your little light show is driving up the electric bill.”

“We were just…”

“You were leaving,” I interrupted. “Unless you want to explain to the Dean why you’re harassing freshmen in a restricted annex.”

Jerrod’s smile faltered. He looked at me, then at his friends, weighing the cost of a scene. He scoffed, deciding it wasn’t worth the effort. “Whatever. People are too sensitive in this dump anyway.”

He turned back to Daniel for one last jab, but stopped. For the first time, he actually looked at his brother. He didn’t see the mess on Daniel’s lip. He saw the needle, the solid, trembling spike of frozen blood hovering inches from his face. Jerrod’s aura flickered. He swallowed hard, the arrogance cracking just enough to show the scared kid underneath.

He didn’t say another word. He spun around and walked away, his group scurrying to catch up.

I waited until their footsteps died out before I looked at Daniel. He was shaking now.

“Daniel,” I said softly. “Stand down.”

His eyes met mine, wide and terrified. The tension snapped. The needle lost its shape, turning back into a simple drop of blood that splashed onto the linoleum.

I handed him a tissue. “Clean it up. Get inside.”

\- - - -

# Daniel

My hands wouldn’t stop trembling as I took my seat. The tissue in my pocket felt heavy, damp with the weight of what I’d almost done. Livia had pulled her chair next to mine. She wasn’t looking at me, but her pencil was moving in sharp, aggressive strokes. She was drawing it, the needle. I could see it taking shape on her pad, jagged and cruel.

I looked away, staring at my thumb. The blood was gone, but I could still feel the phantom pressure of it.

It wasn’t the fear of Jerrod that made my stomach turn. It was that split second when the needle formed. For one heartbeat, I hadn’t wanted to stop. I had wanted to let it fly.

That was the monster the Teacher had seen. And now, it was sitting in the chair right next to me.

\- - - - 

# The Teacher

The room was buzzing with the kind of productive chaos I actually liked. Gabe was arguing with Tasha about shockwave physics. Sofia was whispering to a spider on her desk. They were starting to bond. They were alive.

Then the door opened. No creak, no sound. Leo walked in, and reality just skipped.

Tasha

I was in the middle of a laugh, about to tell Gabe he was an idiot. The words were right there, on the tip of my tongue.

Then, nothing.

The laugh died in my throat. I blinked, looking down at my hands and wondering why my palms were suddenly sweating. The air felt heavy, like the static before a lightning strike, but there was no spark. I looked around, feeling like I’d forgotten what I was just saying.

\- - - - 

# Gabe

I dropped the coin. I never drop the coin.

It hit the floor, but the sound was muffled, like I was hearing it through three feet of water. I looked up, dazed, trying to remember what trick I was doing. My brain felt slippery, like I’d just woken up from a nap I didn’t mean to take. I couldn’t remember the last five seconds.

\- - - -

# Sofia

Mara stopped moving. The connection just snapped.

One second I felt her tiny mind, and the next, there was a wall of cold static. I felt displaced, like I was watching myself from a few feet to the left. I opened my mouth to call her name, but for a second, I couldn’t even remember mine.

\- - - -

# Livia

My pencil stopped mid stroke. I didn’t lift it. I just went still.

I stared at the paper, at the lines I’d just made, but they didn’t look like a drawing anymore. They were just meaningless scratches of carbon on wood pulp. I wondered, for a heartbeat, why I was even holding the pad.

\- - - - 

# The Teacher

I watched it happen. It wasn’t a wave of power. It was an erasure.

Leo walked to the back of the room and sat in the corner without looking at anyone. He just existed, and the world seemed to dim in response. Tasha was staring at her hands. Gabe was looking at the floor in confusion. No one looked at Leo. Their eyes seemed to slide right off him.

I grabbed my pen. My hand felt heavy, reluctant, but I forced it to move. Under a coffee stain on my notepad, I scribbled: Immediate sensory dampening. Passive null field? Cognitive static.

I looked at him. He was perfectly still, eyes fixed on the whiteboard. He wasn’t doing it on purpose. He probably didn’t even know it was happening. He wasn’t invisible, he was just unmemorable. A human void.

I looked down and realized that for a microsecond, I’d forgotten why I was holding the pen. It wasn’t a feeling of pressure. It was a gentle, subtle fog slipping through an open window.

The kids shook it off, blinking, returning to their conversations as if nothing had happened. They didn’t even realize they’d lost time. Leo sat with his shoulders hunched, looking drained, like he’d run a marathon without moving an inch.

Tomorrow, I’d set a trap. Nothing lethal, just enough to see if those shadows move when he’s scared. If they do, we’re not just training broken kids anymore. We’re sitting on a singularity. And I intend to find out how deep it goes.

Ever feel like your savings are just sitting there, doing… nothing? Like a lazy roommate who eats all your snacks but never pays rent? What if I told you that money could be working *way* harder for you—maybe even funding your dream retirement sooner than you think?

Here’s the thing: **Most people underestimate how much their savings can actually grow.** A few smart moves now could turn that ""meh"" nest egg into a full-blown financial powerhouse. Let’s break it down.

### **3 Ways Your Savings Are Secretly Richer Than You Realize**
1. **Compound Interest Is Your Silent Hype Man**
   - That $500 you stashed away? If it grows at 7% annually, it could be **$3,800 in 30 years**—without you lifting a finger.
   - *Pro tip:* The sooner you start, the less you need to save. Time > Timing.

2. **Your ""Small"" Contributions Add Up (Like a Coffee Habit, But Good)**
   - Skip one $5 coffee a week? Invest it instead, and you could have **$10K+ in 20 years**.
   - *Bonus:* No more guilt when you *do* treat yourself.

3. **You’re Probably Leaving Free Money on the Table**
   - Employer 401(k) match? That’s **instant ROI**. Not using it = turning down a raise.
   - *Example:* If your employer matches 5%, and you earn $60K, that’s **$3K/year in free cash**.

### **The Easy Fix? Let Your Money Work Smarter**
You don’t need a finance degree—just a plan. Tools like [this one](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb) can show you *exactly* how much your savings could grow (spoiler: it’s probably more than you think).

*Affiliate note: If you click the link, I may earn a small commission—no extra cost to you!*

So, what’s one small move you could make today to let your money flex its potential? Maybe it’s automating savings, bumping up your 401(k) contribution, or just *finally* checking how much you’re really sitting on.

Drop your link and I'll do yours free.","I've been pulling patterns from Google reviews for the past few weeks. Not reading them one by one, but finding what businesses actually miss.

Some things that made me go ""wait, what?""

The Hoxton Chicago charges $400/night for rooms where the L train literally shakes the walls. Fifteen reviews mention it. Zero soundproofing. Zero discount. Just... ignored.

Dalla Terra Wine Bar has one manager: ""the guy in a suit"", mentioned in 8 reviews as rude and dismissive. That's not a training issue. That's a personnel issue killing a 4.3-star business.

Wall Two 80 has customers saying ""best coffee in Balaclava"" 24 times. Their Google Business description? Generic. They're not using the exact language that drives local search.

PureGym Liverpool: broken AC for 30+ days, gym hitting 30 degrees, management ghosted members on timeline. People canceling memberships and writing 1-star reviews about being ignored.

Razza Pizza: people drive 45 minutes and call it ""life-changing."" But 12 reviews say burnt crusts at $30/pie. The messaging says ""artisan wood-fired."" The reviews says ""inconsistent execution."" That's a positioning-reality gap.

What I'm learning:

1. Voice of customer is sitting in plain sight

South Lake Chalet guests mention ""walkability to beach"" 22 times. It's not in their listing title. That's the primary decision factor and they're not leading with it.

2. Surface complaints hide the real opportunities

""This gym is crowded"" = ""not enough bench presses at peak hours"" (12 mentions)

""This hotel is loud"" = ""L train rooms need discount pricing""

The real insight is always one layer deeper.

3. Differentiation already exists in reviews

Snowy Owl Cafe: ""Authentic Peruvian empanadas"" mentioned 12x. That's differentiation in a saturated coffee market.

Barry's WeHo: Instructor playlist curation mentioned 15x. That's a specific competitive advantage, not just ""good music.""

Most businesses never extract these positioning anchors because they're reading for sentiment, not strategy.

Why I'm doing this:

I'm working on a system that pulls this intelligence from reviews automatically. Analyzed 11 businesses, 5,000+ reviews so far.

Workflow is automated, but I manually QA every report to make sure insights are actually useful (not just sentiment scores and quote dumps).

Trying to answer: What positioning should you lead with? What customer language should be in copy? What operational fix has highest ROI? What's the real reason customers choose competitors?

Currently works with Google Business Profile reviews. Planning to add more platforms (Yelp, TripAdvisor, Airbnb, Amazon, Reddit, etc.) based on what people actually want, trying to avoid building features no one needs.

Drop a Google Maps link + what you want to know:

Why customers choose competitors

What language should be in messaging

What differentiation exists but isn't leveraged

What operational fixes would move the needle

I'll run it through the workflow and share the patterns.

However, when it eventually dies, I'd like to invest in something a bit more capable.

Things I like about the BP are:

1. Size - I could go slightly larger, but not too much
2. Convenience - it's minimal effort, and I don't have to wait long from deciding to make a coffee to the machine being ready

Where I think I'd like to improve with the next machine is:

1. Steam wand - while the BP is not bad, I feel like it's not particularly powerful and while good texture I can get reasonably consistently, great texture is very rare. I steam manually. I also am not keen on having to purge water before steam comes out.
2. Quality of shot - without having anything to compare against, I'm just not 100% convinced that shot quality is as good as it could be from the BP.
3. Standard sizes - not a big one for me, but I do feel like equipment upgrades (portafilters etc.) are somewhat limited by the non-standard size of the Sage.

Budget would be about £600-750 for the machine only.

In terms of the rest of my setup in case it makes a difference, I have a Sage Dose Pro grinder and fresh roasted beans delivered (every 6 weeks). Beans are stored in an air-tight container and I top the hopper up every few days from that. Tap water where I am is soft (kettle only needs descaling once a year or so) but I use the ClaroSwiss filters anyway, changing about every 4-6 months. I have scales, but don't typically use them unless I'm making Turkish coffee.

Any recommendations for improving my existing situation also welcome.",1,1768733311.0,espresso,5,0.67,False

Today's Pick: **Race to 25 - Neither**

**$DKNG**: **-107**

Wager Amount: 2.14U to WIN 2U

League: Houston Texans vs New England Patriots (2PM CST on ESPN)

**Recap**: Wasn't my favorite bet yesterday (it was my 3rd favorite) which is why I only 1U. Normally I would have gone whatever units to win +1U and **I refuse to wager more than 1U on this player prop bet because I wasn't supremely confident in it**. The matchup and the logic was all there (Niners allows 2nd most receptions and JSN has the 4th most receptions in the league), but just had this feeling that somehow Darnold was not going to pass as much because of his injury and I was suspcion was right! It is what it is and I sincerely apologize for taking it as my POTD yesterday. I so wanted to go to Khalil Shakir at O 4.5 Rec. (Got it -130 last Sunday) but the line bump up to O/U 5.5 Rec. and I had no problem taking O 5.5 Rec. but the problem was that there were several cappers on this player prop and I hate to go to a player prop that everyone has, no matter how much I love the wager. And I even consider going alternate line at 7+ Rec. for Khalil Shakir at +150 (which I did end up wager a half unit myself), so had to pivot and take this JSN player prop which was a complete fail. Darnold and JSN didn't even need to do much in this game, the special team and defense pretty much won this game for them. But yea, I kno it sucks to lose and unfortunately my least favorite wager was the only one that didn't come thru

**Khalil Shakir O 5.5 Rec.✅+2U**

**Khalil Shakir 7+ Rec. Alt. Line✅+0.65U**

**Niners/Seahawks O 44.5✅+1U**

**Jaxon Smith-Njigba 7+ Rec Alt. Line❌-1U**

**Matchup:** Today's bet is actually my favorite wager for today and I don't see any capper on this bet, so I will gladly take this as my POTD. I love the U 40.5 in the Texans/Patriots game, but you all I kno I like to handicap my wagers in a unique way, gimme the game prop bet of Race to 25 - Neither in this game. This means neither team reaches to 25 points at the end of game. Both teams are great defensive teams and all season long each respective defense has been mostly dominated in their respective matchups. Texans allowed 17.3 ppg and Pats allow 18.7 ppg to their opponents. Two great defense, a low scoring affair. Not fading CJ Stroud this time despite that he sucks in cold weather. Last time these two teams met there was a high 62 combined points, but that was two different teams and this year both these defense have massively improved. I like the U 40.5 but I'm taking this game prop instead just to give myself a lil cushion for room.

**The Play & Prediction :** I like the U 19.5 in the 1st half too at +105 so if you like plus money I would take that as well, but the POTD play is 2.14U on Race to 25 Neither

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

*June 2, 2016*

Okay, I'm home, and its over... I think? Anyway, he is pathetic so pathetic and I'm so glad he is gone. 

So I landed and followed my attorney's advice. I sent him a text message saying ""I've just landed at *major city airport* and will be home soon. As per our discussion last week, I wish to confirm you have vacated my home as you agreed.""

Anyway, a few minutes after he read it he started blowing up my phone, which I refused to answer. I just kept rejecting it and sending it to voicemail. I didn't listen to the messages but I might later once I've calmed down. 

I did give my brother a heads up that I was about to send the message. He texted me and said ""he got it, he isn't happy, he smashed a glass, he is on the phone to his MOM.""

So that kinda scared me because Ex has never shown any violent tendencies before. So my sister rang my dad, who couldn't get here for a few hours because he was down at the lakehouse, so instead I rang BFF who agreed to come over with HER dad (who is a retired police officer). Gotta love dads.

When I arrived Ex was standing on the porch, I was shaking a bit as I approached the porch, but then my brother walks out and says ""please let me be of service ma'am,"" and takes my luggage and escorts me inside. He cracks me up. Anyway, Ex wasn't saying anything and I didn't want to say anything because I was a bit frightened, we were just kinda milling about in the lounge while my brother sat peppering me with questions about my trip. Then my BFF and her dad knock on the door. 

Ex asked what they were doing here, and I said ""well I wasn't expecting you to be here so I arranged to have company."" He asked if we could talk privately and I said we could talk in the dining room off the lounge where everyone was sitting. 

I agreed, and he had the following things to say:

He thought that once I got home and had ""cooled down"" we would be able to sort things out. That the whole thing was just a big brewhaha and it didn't have to be. That he loved me and he knew ""we"" could all have a good relationship if we worked on it (by we he meant me, him AND his mother). He said I was the love of his life and he would fight for me, and that he deserved another chance.

I'll admit I was kinda swaying a bit, he was crying and I felt really bad about it. Then I did crumble a bit and I used IMP's line (because Imp is AMAZING) and said ""if our relationship is to have any chance at all then you need to move out for a while."" He was nodding his head when I saw something out the window.

HIS MOTHER WAS WALKING ACROSS MY LAWN.

HIS MOTHER!

I said ""what the hell is she doing here?""

He replied ""she wants to help.""

I said ""This isn't about HER! This is about YOU, YOUR unhealthy relationship with her and your inability to put anyone else before her. The fact she has turned up to help her 28yo son with a relationship problem is fucked up and a perfect example of what I'm talking about!""

Anyway he stepped around me to walk out and open the door and I snapped and said ""that BITCH steps foot in my house and I'll fucking throw her out myself.""

 

Well...

 

That was it.

Apparently, nobody insults his mother. He turned on me and said ""what did you just fucking call her?""

It wasn't my proudest moment but I said something like ""I called her what she is. A nasty, passive-aggressive, manipulative BITCH with an unhealthy attachment to her son, and her efforts to keep her grips on you has already destroyed TWO engagements. She is a BITCH. She comes in here and I will THROW HER OUT.""

Anyway he chested up to me and thats when BFF's dad stepped between us and said ""I think thats more than enough. Ex, its time you packed your bags and left.""

And he did. He went outside, told his mother to go home (she started crying and asking to come in and help fix things) and then he came back in, packed a bag of clothes and his toiletries and left.

So thats it. If you ever want to get rid of a mommy's boy... just insult his mother!

He still has things here so I'm going to send a registered letter giving him thirty days to arrange collection or it will be delivered to his mother's. My brother said he is more than happy to do the delivery for me.

So... sorry it wasn't more eventful, it was kinda all over in about half an hour.

I'm exhausted. 

 

Oh.. and because I know it'll be asked.

- he will be removed off DD's pick up list tomorrow morning

- locks are being changed tomorrow morning

- I'm having the ring couriered to him and signed for so he can't deny it later

- If I can get any deposits back for the wedding I'll send him a cheque for 50% of the refunded money to his account so he can't claim I ripped him off (we both contributed to the wedding deposits)

Anything I've forgotten?

Thanks everyone, and I'm sorry Queens for the crazy thread!

An update on DD and my BSC exFMIL (I haven't heard from ex at all)

I surprised DD this afternoon and she was very happy. I took her for ice cream and explained that ex wouldn't be around anymore as him and I had decided not to be together. She asked if that meant no wedding and I said that was correct. She kinda surprised me, she looked at me and said ""that's very sad, mommy... Lucky we didn't buy our dresses yet."" 

She did have a little cry over not seeing ex again but she seems over it already (for now) and is currently playing with my brother.

And MIL sent me a text:

""Can we please talk? I feel this is all just so silly. It's also not fair on DD to cut her out of our lives so I hope that's not your intention.""

I just can't even with this woman.

# [Peena Comment (after ex took matters to facebook)](https://community.babycenter.com/post/a62791180/mil-ruining-vacay-541?cid=2532905541):

OMFG I can't get it to work so it's not blurry and half off the screen and I can't be bothered screwing around with it anymore, so it's the manual way or nothing.

Ok. Here is what he said. My eyes rolled so hard they're still stuck in the back of my head. 

""By now you're probably aware I'm single. I'm not sure what you've heard but in short *Peena* agreed to come away on a beautiful vacation paid for by my mother, and then proceeded to behave like a brat. She then chose to leave. Am I sad? Yes of course. But I'm more disappointed the woman I loved could be reduced to an abusive screaming banshee towards my mother who has done nothing but be generous to her. I don't know what you've been told but it's probably untrue or exaggerated.""

Then my friend replied (and this is paraphrased because I can't be bothered typing it all out) saying ""since you're airing your dirty laundry in public can you confirm if it's true you invited your mom to join you on your and Peena's vacation and then took your mom's side when Peena asked for a little alone time and your mom said no?"" 

By all accounts this comment eventually got liked a heap of times before being deleted and then someone wrote below that ""^wow lol"" followed by [this meme](http://imageserve.babycenter.com/19/000/388/wHRZJqy5sDoCmBvUHv8iJ1ZlPljSjwWO_lg.jpg). Haha!

If I wasn't so done with him I'd feel bad but hey he put it out there so he has to be prepared for what might come back right? 

From here I'm only going to communicate with him regarding matters of collecting his items and as soon as that's done I'm blocking him too. Unfortunately changing my number isn't an option as its a work cell and it would be such a drama and mean reaching out to all my clients and network,  new stationary, a website update etc

Hey DD just went to bed so have had a chance to get online. 

I haven't put anything on FB and don't plan to. SIL rang me tonight and asked if I was okay. I told her what happened at my house and she said he was telling a similar story but is claiming he had no idea his mommy was coming to help (lie) and we had almost sorted things out when his mom turned up and I ""went psycho."" He left out the bit where he chested up to me and was asked to leave. Apparently he told BIL he doesn't understand where my hatred of his mother comes from and my BIL reeled off a few examples of things he'd witnessed or knew about (eg. the dollhouse incident) and said they were perfect examples of his mom's typical behaviour and that it wasn't normal. SIL said ex deleted his status because he copped a fair bit of ridicule apparently so I must have only seen an early screen shot. She said there were a few ""sorry to hear that's"" and ""hope you're okay"" and comments like that too.

# [Peena Comment:](https://community.babycenter.com/post/a62791180/mil-ruining-vacay-541?cid=2533068222)
No real drama llamas on the pick up just a few little laughs. Ex turned up in his mom's SUV, and yes she was driving him. Oh god he is so lame!

He packed the car while brother stood there watching, then he claimed items were missing. My brother asked what items specifically and ex couldn't list them. He told ex that he needs to contact me if he felt items were missed. 

Ex gave up and went to leave, apparently as he walked off my brother said ""living with mommy I see? Oh she must be so thrilled to have her husband home again,"" and then he ran into the house because he is half ex's size and was terrified he might get his ass kicked.

After that they sat in the driveway for like five mins arguing (at least it looked like arguing from brother's view behind the loungeroom curtain), before exFMIL got out and put a gift on the front porch for DD. *sigh* 

I'll donate the gift, but Brother is getting a VERY nice birthday present from me this year. 

I personally haven't heard anything from ex and I hope it stays that way. 

Fingers crossed!

# [Peena Comment:](https://community.babycenter.com/post/a62791180/mil-ruining-vacay-541?cid=2533082195)

oh the gift was a green and white gift bag with little owls on it with a stuffed bunny inside (excuse the pink bedsheets). exFMIL knows that DD loves bunnies. DD wants a real one so badly but I know I'll end up looking after it and I couldn't think of anything worse, so it's not happening anytime soon.

I've blacked out DD and exfMILs name from the little card attached. It said ""Dear DD, I miss you and look forward to seeing you soon, love ExFMIL.""

# [Peena Comment:](https://community.babycenter.com/post/a62791180/mil-ruining-vacay-541?cid=2533240488)

Hey sorry I've been offline, back at work now and trying to adjust to not having ex to help with DD so had to do some juggling. 

Things haven't been exactly quiet - I did engage about the coffee machine and was quite harsh, but I got it off my chest. It was a mistake to engage though because today he left a vmail saying ""fine, I choose you okay? I fucking choose you. I'll never speak to my mother again just take me back."" 

I swear he is giving me whiplash.

I've BH'd it because I know he is full of crap and unfortunately any affection I had for him has evaporated over recent weeks. 

Thanks for the PANs on photo editing apps to btw - helped me finally work out for to edit these screenshots without them getting blurry.

Oh the tangents this thread goes on. Don't cross the streams - as a child when they said that I thought they meant don't cross the streams as in WATER streams - like in the future they weren't allowed to cross any streams of water because it would have a devastating impact on the world. It never made sense to me but I accepted it.

And my wonderful magical coffee machine is a De'Longhi Nespresso Latissima Touch and if anyone ever dared screw with it things would get super ugly super quick.

You guys will be SO proud of me today. Ex sent me flowers... they arrived in the morning and I REJECTED THEM. I honestly felt kinda powerful. I lied to the delivery guy and said ""look this is super awkward but I have a stalker who keeps sending me things like this, if it's from someone called *ex* then I can't accept it."" He checked for me and said they were from him and he took them away with his apologies. 

Two hours later I got a vmail from ex shouting ""YOU TOLD THEM I WAS A STALKER?"" 

I found it so funny, it was one of the first belly laughs I've had in a while because he sounded SO utterly outraged.

Coming to you live on my way to the airport where at the ass crack of dawn I'm off to NYC for two days for a conference. DD is staying with my parents and my brother is back at my place. Sorry I have been awol, I had a digital detox and spent some much needed time with DD just relaxing and getting projects done around the house (DD's room is now yellow!)

And no they haven't tried to stalk DD. I'd go nuclear if that happened. I got a phone call yesterday from Ex wanting to see her. I stupidly answered. I told him that he had no rights to custody and I needed him to stop harassing me or I would need to take it further. He asked me if I was going to keep him from seeing DD, and I said I would because that's a consequence of our relationship ending. He told me he was moving out of exMIL's house and into one of his apartments. He then paused dramatically like he was expecting me to fucking congratulate him or something. Instead I said ""Okay, I gotta go."" 

After this I thought to myself ""what would DWIL do"" and sent him a text saying ""as per our conversation, our relationship is over and your continued harassment of me will result in further action being taken. You and exMIL are not to approach DD and any attempts to do so will result in the police being notified.""

He has not replied, but at least it's done.

No other updates for now

Hi everyone! 

All good on the Peena front. Thanks for helping me get through a terrible time. So a few minor noms, nothing too ridiculous.

ExFMIL left another gift on our front door step for my daughter. I returned to sender with a note telling her to fuck off and leave us alone. She posted a screenshot of my note on FB, tagged ex and called me ""vulgar."" One of ex and my mutual friends responded and said ""what's vulgar is you airing your drama on Facebook. Why don't you leave Peena and DD alone? They've moved on, you should too."" That earnt my friend a blocking but apparently the picture also got deleted. Ha!

And... ex has been spotted around town with an 18yo - the younger sister of one of his friend's who is PISSED. Word has it they hooked up on Tinder. He is denying any involvement with her but she has updated her profile photo to a pic of her and him. So he continues to embarrass himself. 

Other than that, I'm good, I'm taking a few days vacation time to go on a mini vacay with DD before she goes to school. Im thinking maybe a farm stay and some horse riding, or maybe a water park? Decisions decisions!

*August 20, 2016*

Hi everyone.

Guess who is dating again? I figured I may as well get back on the wagon. He is one of the school dads, a divorcee and one night we started chatting about the circumstances that led to his divorce...

Turns out his exMIL was a psycho and the third member of his marriage. Parental alienation, undermining him as father, saying nasty things to the kids about him, the works. He finally gave his wife an ultimatum and she chose her mom. He went through a hard battle but now has 50% custody, and exMIL had gone from seeing the children every day to only on his ex's custody time. Right of first refusal is driving exMIL CRRRAAAZZZYYY because he never lets her baby sit. Ever. She has even tried to make her daughter take him back to court to get it amended, but fortunately his ex has realised he won't back down. 

Anyway, I'm taking it slowly but it makes me feel good that he has experienced BSC MIL first hand AND his own mother lives on the other side of the country. 😆

*January 29, 2017*

 hope this is alright with the Queens. Just wanted to say thanks again for your support last year and provide a little update.


So school dad and I are still dating. It got super serious quite quickly and... welll... I'm PREGNANT! It was a nice surprise and it's actually why I'm back on BBC. We had discussed it as we would both like another child and agreed I would go off the Pill. My obgyn said it would take a while for my cycle to sort out because I've been on the pill for so many years, but wouldn't you know - first cycle off and I'm now about eight weeks pregnant! Argh! 


We told my family and his family and WOAH boundary stomping future MIL is on the scene. She wants to come to my appointments! Helllll no. I'm going to have to use all my DWIL smarts to keep this one in line and might need advice on how to handle her with tact.


We haven't told DD or his children yet because we want to wait until we're 12 weeks along, and we're making plans to move in together. I refuse to sell my home but it's not big enough for all of us, so we're moving in with him and will rent mine out. Thankfully he has a spare room for DD which she can decorate to her hearts content, and his kids (son and daughter, ages 6 & 8) won't 

be displaced or made to change rooms.


As for ex - he got the 18yo pregnant! Such a scandal. BUT, bravo to her she did not stay with him! I thought she would have for sure, apparently exFMiL is BESIDE herself because this girl won't have anything to do with her. She is living at home with her parents who won't let her stop her education, so apparently they're hiring a nanny or something to support her while she is at school. Not my monkeys or circus, but I was glad to hear that exMIL didn't get her claws into the girl. 


So I'll keep you updated on things with futureMiL, here is hoping she is trainable! 


Thanks DWIL!

*May 22, 2016*

I'm a long time lurker and I've changed my screen name because like an idiot I used my real name. I'm going to get flamed hard for this but I want to validate whether I should suck it up and deal when I get home or get the hell out of dodge now.

 I'm currently in Playa DeL Carman. A few months ago we planned this vacay and had been saving saving saving so we could go luxe and not have to scrimp. We were originally going with BIL and his wife who I loooove, but they had to cancel because SIL got pregnant and didn't want to travel. All good happy to go with just DF, first time away from DD but she will have a blast with my parents at their lake house with her cousins so all good in the hood. 

 We go to lunch at MILs one Sunday, share our vacation plans and she seems excited for us. I leave because I have an assignment due and need to get it finished, DF hangs back. He gets home and I mention going online later that night to book everyone and he says ""no need, it's all done! MIL wanted to come with us, so she decided to give us the holiday as a present so we went ahead so went online and booked it."" Anyway I lost my shit. No way was I going away with her, don't get me wrong she is usually fine compared to MILs on here, but I don't want a third wheel. DF and I argue, I'm ungrateful, we need to support MIal who divorced last year and is depressed blah blah blah. I finally cave... Because free holiday. 

 Fast forward, we're here now.

 I'm. In. HELL. First of all she booked a suite - we are SHARING A SUITE WITH HER. I want to be able to walk around nude. I wanted to be able to sunbath topless in our private pool. I wanted to be able to have sex whenever I damn well wanted. Well no not now. DF knew my head nearly exploded when we checked in and I realised we were all in together.

 She won't leave us alone! She won't let us sleep in - apparently that's LAZY. Don't call me lazy bitch I get up at 5.00am every day when I'm home.  She makes us do all the activities - I don't wanna do yoga or play chess fuck off. She makes us have every meal with her. She won't even let us nap durin the day because ""why waste such glorious sunshine."" I WANT TO NAP! I'm four days in and I'm done with this bullshit. I told DF I needed some time alone because I was about to punch her so I rang and booked myself in at the spa. She was excited because that meant alone time for her and DF! wtf?

 Anyway I got back from the spa and said I want to have dinner alone with him tonight and actually enjoy some time together. He told her and she threw a fricken tantrum! Said we were abandoning her! I walked out to the little private pool we have and DF stayed inside to console her. He came out and tried to ""reason"" with me. I said it was her or me because I didn't come here to baby sit a fricken retiree. He chose her. He went back inside.

 So now I'm at the bar, this drink in the pic? Yeah that's tequila. The barman gave me this turtle, I've named him Dereck. So Do I go home? It's super late and he has been FB messaging me asking me to come back and talk. I think he is freaking out - but obviously not enough to come and FIND ME given I haven't left the resort. Do I apologise and suck it up? Do I go get my own room? I'm honestly leaning towards my own room but I have to go back and get my stuff to do that.

 Sorry this feels like a vent. I feel like this was a big cross roads in our relationship and he chose the wrong road.

Holy shit that is genius. Is it wrong that I really want to do that? 

Given its like 1.00am here, I'm thinking I either go get my stuff and haul ass to reception and hope they have free rooms. Or I play nice til morning and then leave altogether. Because I've had toomuch to drink Dereck and I are leani towards playing nice til morning.

May 22, 2016

Oooookay, I went back to the room. DF is here, he was awake. MIL was asleep probably basking in the comfort of all the alone time she has shared with her husband-son.

I was all ready for a fight and then he kinda blew my mind and not in a good way. 

He said he was sorry and regretted allowing MIL to come with us. But apparently it took him calling BIL to COMPLAIN about me for him to see the light. Because BIL took MY side and told him if he had invited (yes INVITED oh its all coming out now) MIL on vacation with him and his wife it would have been the end of their marriage, and DF needs to grow up and realise he is a soon-to-be husband first and son second. DF then went onto ask me if I could apologise and just play nice with MIL for the rest of the vacation and he'd never do anything like this again.

So I agreed and I know you're all going to think I've gone mad... but it's Because in the morning when they go to their stupid yoga class I'm going to exit stage left. 

So he is asleep thinking everything is so lovely and I am FUUUMING. He probably thinks I'm catching up on Facebook or something right now. Don't care. I'm going to go stay somewhere else, because this is the only time I'll have off before the holidays and I'll be damned if I'm going to spend it sitting home waiting for him to show up.

To answer some Q's. Yes, we live together. It is my home, I purchased it before we got together. I am financially independent of him, we weren't planning on merging finances until after the wedding. He does live with me but his name is on nothing, he contributes cash every month for expenses. He lived with his mother until we got together. He placates her and pretty much gives her what she wants. She in return gives him money and crazy expensive gifts (like a BMW for his 21st) I naively thought once we were married this bullshit would stop. 

DD is not his, she is from a previous relationship. My ex boyfriend (DD's father) passed away when she was a few months old. My parents supported my in raising her until I graduated college, and now I'm in Sales and studying a business degree online. Thankfully my job pays super well and I'm very good at it and I allllways have a rainy day nest egg to rely on so no stress there.

As for the money I saved for this? Yup, I still have all $9,000 of it and I plan on spending a chunk of it on myself RIGHT NOW! 

I'm about to go onto Expedia and see what resorts take my fancy, hopefully I can book online or I'll just cross fingers and hope they have a vacancy when I arrive. In the morning I'm going to say I'm too hungover to leave the room and try and get them to leave. When they do I'm going to pack like a maniac, get to the concierge and get them to get me a car to the new resort.

Dereck and I are looking forward to extended periods of nudity.

He has property and stocks, I mean a grown man living with mom has nothing better to spend it on. I'm not interested in any of it.

As for hooking up with a marine... Well I am most definitely a sucker for a man in uniform 

I can't sleep... I want to start packing now, BUT I have decided to go to one of the resorts I was originally considering. It's a fair distance from here but at least I know I won't be tracked down.

I also messaged my BFF and my sister (who to be fair predicted this would end in disaster) and they're seeing if they can get off work to come join me for a few days. 

How good does this look?

He always puts her feelings first. She gets offended easily and can be quite PA.

On Mothers Day DD wanted to cook a big breakfast for me with DF, and he said no because he had to go to cook his mom breakfast. He said we could all celebrate together so like an idiot I agreed and we all went to FMILs. DD was quite upset and quiet, on the way home I asked her what was wrong and she said she was told that the event at MILs would be for everyone but it wasn't, it was (in her words) ""all about MIL"" when it should have been for me too. Broke my heart, and DF said ""that is because MIL is old and doesn't live with her children anymore so that makes MD all the more special for her, and because DD lives with me everyday is like MD for me.""

And I just sat there and said nothing.

I'm going to leave a note. I have to. I know silence and just disappearing would be the ultimate fuck you but it could also spark an international woman hunt if they report me missing. I'm going to write

""We planned this vacation for months, for you and me to spend quality time together. Relaxing, enjoying each other's company, sleeping in, good food and cocktails, making love and seeing the sites. Instead, you chose to invite your mother who labelled us lazy, wanted us up at the butt crack of dawn, demanded we sign up for every bullshit activity in the place, would not let us spend a second alone, rejoiced when she got spend time alone with you BUT when I asked for ONE MEAL alone with you she threw a tantrum. And you chose HER. While I cried alone in a bar you stayed with her. You're not ready to be a husband and father. I hope you and your mother have a very happy life together.""

DF is awake. He is in the shower. He asked me if I'm coming to breakfast, for science I asked if him and I could have a sleep in instead. He gestured awkwardly towards the other room and said ""yeah but mom is already up, let's do it tomorrow, I'll talk to her."" Ugh, so nothing changes.

I told him I was hungover and didn't feel like anything and would meet them by the pool later this morning. He kissed me and said okay like he was giving me fucking permission or something. 

And now I pretend to sleep until the coast is clear. Not sure when I'll update next as I'm dependent on a wifi connection.

*May 22, 2016*

Ooookay. 

So after he finished in the shower him and MIL came into the room to talk to me. I acted like I was super deep asleep and he even shook me awake! Asshole! He said something like ""I'm sorry we just really need to speak to you and set things right.""

Anyway dot point summary: 

- his mom was so sorry about yday, she just didn't like being told what was happening with dinner, she preferred to be asked.
- that being said it was rude to demand a meal alone, it would have been more appropriate to do something like surprise MIL with a spa or crafts session so she'd be occupied rather than expect she sit alone in a restaurant on her vacation.
- ultimately she is paying and felt a bit hurt that she was to be excluded.
- They agreed that once a day STBX and I would be able to do something alone together.
- Now that was said could we hug and make up?
- am I sure I want to waste the day lying in bed?

Anyway, I hugged her. It made me wan to vomit but I did it and with a smile promised I would meet them by the pool in a few hours.

As soon as I left I packed like a woman possessed. Thankfully MIL has tidied my suitcase th day before (HA THANKS BITCH) so that sped things up considerably. I think I was done in about ten mins and started hauling my luggage to Reception. Thank god halfway there a staff member saw me and took pity and called for someone at Reception to bring the little golf buggy with the trailer down to collect it for me, which was great because I FORGOT MY PASSPORT! Heart attack! So I ran back to the room and opened the safe and realised I had also left my jewelry and cash behind too. FUCK! 

So passport in hand I made it back to my luggage where it was being loaded onto the trailer and they let me ride with them. At Reception I explained the situation to the concierge, but exaggerated a bit and said MIL had crashed our honeymoon and broken up our marriage (to get him to take me seriously), so he organised for the private hotel car to drive me to the new resort. SCORE! 

When I arrived they had a room but no check in until the afternoon, but they upgraded me which was so Nice. so I went and lay by the pool and kinda dozed and ate junk and drank some cocktails. Finally got into my room this afternoon and crashed. Woke up to my phone BLOWING UP from exdf and MIL. 

Lucky I gave my family and close friends a heads up on what I was doing because exDF and MIL tried to tell them I had gone missing and cause a drama! 

I also have confirmation that bff and my sister are coming on Thursday for the weekend!

It's getting late here. I spent most of the day doing what I wanted to do in the first place  - absolutely nothing. I'm going to do nothing tomorrow, and then I've booked myself in for a day trip to go swimming with all the derecks in the ocean and to a Cenote (did i spell that correctly?)

DF continues to message all butthurt and not accepting that we're done. MIL left one more voicemail telling me that she has been told not to leave me anyone voicemails but she wanted to leave one more telling me I am being silly and its my last chance to repair things with her before she stops supporting me as DF's future wife.

Here is what I'm drinking right now. I might have a few more and thern I'm going to bed. 

With Dereck. Who is okay. He does not need to be saved. He is my man and I'm sticking by him.

when I realised we were sharing a suite I refused to unpack (had a feeling it would end badly) and left my stuff in my suitcase, which everytime I needed something I'd rustle through it. So it ended up being a big tangled mess of clothes, bikinis and toiletries. It was bugging her so when I was in the shower she emptied it onto the bed and re-packed it. ExDF sat there and watched her do it and couldn't understand why I was pissed afterwards because she was ""doing me a favor.""

Hi y'all, sorry I have been MIA I needed some tech free time, and if my phone or iPad are with me I WILL use them so I locked them in my safe.

Anyway who said he would get nasty? Well he is. He seems to prefer voicemails, which is moronic because he knows I'm only checking messages once a day. Anyway he can't believe I've ""abandoned him"" in a foreign country. Apparently I'm overreacting and immature and need to grow up. He wants to know where I am so he can come talk sense into me etc

Also to the PP who asked about my photos in the cloud and Find my iPhone? When this all started a lovely person on here PAN'd me with that advice and I acted because he could have tracked me down that way. I'm not posting anything on SM at the moment but MIL posted a nice little PA status about how grateful she is to be spending precious alone time with her gorgeous charming son in Mexico and tagged him in it. To my amusement one of ex's smart mouth buddies commented ""nothing like a romantic getaway for mother and son #awkward"" and quite a few people 'liked' his comment. HAHA!

I'm honestly struggling a bit second guessing myself. Some of this is on me for caving in and agreeing to this vacation so surely it's on me for it going badly? I just facetimed with DD and she asked to speak to DF. I just said he was out by the pool but that made me sad because they do love each other dearly. 

I emailed my cousin yday who is an attorney to let her know what is happening and what my legal rights are regarding getting him out of my house. It isn't her area of expertise so she is getting a colleague to handle it for me so no legal advice please - trust me I'm all over it like a rash.

Oh - and today a wedding party full of Canadians arrived at the resort and took over the pool. I'll admit I sucked my stomach in every time I had to walk past them.

SIL just Facetimed to offer me support. She admitted MIL nearly broke her and BIL up several times in the past. She gave him an ultimatum and he chose her - THAT is why they're on LC with MIL. She said she wanted to warn me about this year's ago but ultimately felt it was none of her business, which I respect. 

She said BIL and her are there for me no matter what, and ex knows that they think he has fucked up big time. Apparently ex is panicking but has mil in his ear badmouthing me which is influencing his behaviour. I told her about the suggestion to send a bottle of champagne to their room congratulating them on their happy Union and she snortled her tea all over the screen of her phone.

Just lots of little things, like putting his mother's wants ahead of mine and not addressing her behaviour.

I'd want to spend a Sunday down at my parents lake house and he wouldn't want to because we couldn't possibly miss MIL's family lunch which she hosts every fucking weekend (DD and I don't always go, but ex does). 

During the week he would tell me he had to swing by MIL's to help her with something (like change a light bulb) and I'd have dinner on the table and he would be a no show. When he would eventually get home he'd confess MIL had cooked dinner for him but apparently he couldn't be fucked letting me know? Ugh. This happened a lot. 

On my birthday I really wanted to go for Mexican and he said he'd take care of it. On the night we get to the restaurant and it's Italian. He tells me MIL gets indigestion from Mexican so we had to go somewhere else - I didn't even know she was fucking invited! The next day my family took me to Mexican because fuck him. He got butthurt and sulked the whole meal while I thanked my family repeatedly for giving me what I wanted for my birthday.

On grandparents day at DD's school my mom and dad were going and ex and MIL both got offended that we didn't invite her. So DD did, and wrote her a special invitation card and MIL didn't come anyway. 

MIL always tries to one up me. I make an amazing vegetarian lasagne, and SIL is vegetarian and has had it before and loves it. So I offered to bring some to Thanksgiving (we only do traditional turkey every second year) and she accepted my offer. When I got there MIL had made her own vegetarian lasagne (which she has never made before in her fucking life and by all reports was bland as fuck) and she left mine in the kitchen! SIL, bless her, spoke up and said ""hey MIL, you forgot to serve Peena's lasagne! It's amazing so I'm going to go get some."" She left the table and bought it back and her and DD dug into it. MIL's CBF was EPIC.

For Christmas I had said I was getting DD a vintage dollhouse and had been collecting the furniture for it all year... guess what MIL gave her? Thank fuck I refused to do presents with MIL on Xmas Eve and went to my parent's instead. The bitch fully intended to give her dollhouse to DD and ruin my giving of the dollhouse the next day. Thankfully my dollhouse was so much better - MILs was cheap plastic. DD who is so sassy said ""oh thank you MIL it's so cool,"" then turned to me and said ""since the one you got me is in my bedroom, can we keep this one at the lake house?"" God I wanted to scoop her up and smother her with kisses.

There is more, just lots of little things building up to this. I think maybe that's why I didn't put my foot down about her coming with us to Mexico, because I knew it would give me a clear out if I needed it.



Gosh it felt good to get that off my chest. The thing is, with all of it, ex saw no problems with her behaviour. So that's when the whole vacation thing came up I heard the death bells ringing on our relationship.

*May 25, 2016*

He found me you guys! The fucking moron found me! I swear he must have called every five star hotel along the coast asking to be put through to my room. When I checked in I was told anyone who came would need to know my room number well guess that wasn't true!

So I got a little bored this afternoon and decided to hit up the Tulum ruins. When I got back I got dropped out the front and could see up into the foyer. Guess who was sitting there!

I swear my heart nearly jumped out of my throat! 

Anyway, as much as I don't want to see the douchecanoe, I'm not afraid of him so I walked up to him and said something like ""you realise you look like a fucking stalker right now."" At that point the Concierge who helped me when I arrived and knew my situation heard me and FREAKED out. Next thing you know two little Mexican security guards are standing there trying to escort him out. It was pretty funny. I felt bad for the moron and called them off and went and sat with him at the Reception Bar. I told him he had two minutes to say whatever it was he had to say and then I was done (we ended up talking for about an hour). 

In summary:
- he was wrong to invite his mom without discussing it with me first (I responded that the fact it was even an option in his mind in the first place is what's wrong here)
- he just thought it would be nice for his mom post divorce and that she would pay (I responded that I don't need nor want a dime of her money and it's pathetic and co-dependent that he does) 
- he should have refused to share a suite with her and asked for seperate rooms (I pointed out that even if we were in seperate rooms it wouldn't have improved things because she would have been knocking on our door every two mins)
- its important to him that his mom and I have a strong relationship (I said to him the only relationship I could have with his mother was NO relationship)
- He understood I needed my time away but could we at least commit to working things out when I got home. (I said no and he started crying)

I told him that his dependency on his mom was unnatural and abnormal. That if he ever wanted to have a normal relationship with a woman he would have to learn that she comes first and not subject her to his mother's bullshit.

I told him that BIL's relationship with MIL was the normal one and he should look to that as a good model to replicate. I also advised him to seek therapy for his mommy issues.

I asked him if he had long term plans for MIL to live with us when she became elderly and he said yes. I told him that was not a future I wanted for me or DD, and I would be embarrassed and ashamed if DD thought she had to support me in my retirement. I pointed out that my parents were older than MIL and not as wealthy, yet they'd already mapped out their future financially to age 100 and it didn't involve being dependent on us.

I asked him if his relationship with ex fiancée ended because she couldn't stand his mother and the relationship he had with her, and he said yes. 

He asked if we could revisit this when we got home and I said the only thing we would be doing when we got home was moving him out of my house. 

I asked him to respect my wish for him to leave me alone for the remainder of our time here, and he agreed. Then he left.

And now I'm having a very strong margarita to calm myself. 

How did I do, DWIL?

Thanks y'all, I'm shaking a bit but I feel much better. The thought of having to live with her makes me feel sick to my stomach. Bullet officially dodged there. 

I also forgot to mention that I offered him the ring back and he declined. I don't think that's the end of the ring discussion though so I'll keep it locked up in case he changes he mind. 

I also did mention a few nasty things she had done (the dollhouse incident) and refusing to have Mexican on my bday but eating it here freely, and he instantly jumped to her defence. I stopped him and said ""this right here is the problem. You can't even LISTEN to someone criticise her without freaking out and getting defensive. You'll never be able to protect me and DD and any future children from her toxicity because you can't even see it."" 

*Comments asking how he found her*

He admitted he called all the resorts I'd shortlisted originally and asked to be put through to my room. 

He confessed he booked her into the spa for the afternoon to get a break from her.

*Editor's Note: They refers to her best friend and sister*
Back in my room to refresh before dinner!

Oh I'm so happy they're here. I met them in Reception and when I saw them I just started bawling. I think the last few days have really built up on me and I've been feeling so lonely. It was great timing! 

I got a message from ex this afternoon saying ""just letting you know mom and I are heading back home early.""

I replied ""So sorry to hear your romantic getaway is being cut short. Where will you be staying when you get home?""

Him: ""at home until you get back and we can talk.""
Me: ""there is nothing to talk about. I need you to move out.""
Him: ""Lets just wait until we're home.""
Me: ""You're not listening. You need to leave.""
Him: ""We'll talk when we get home."" 

He isn't taking me seriously you guys. I'm all over the legal aspect so will go down that route and take care of it when I'm back.

I messaged my brother telling him if he is comfortable to stay put, and in response he sent me a pic of him wearing his underwear, a sweatshirt and a fake police officers cap with the words ""yes ma'am"" under the pic.

Sorry just got back! Having so much fun but exhausted - yay for no insomnia.

To be crystal clear - there is no chance for us, and I have been crystal fucking clear with him on this issue. Changing my Facebook relationship status is the last thing on my mind, I'm not one of those people who gives a shit about that kind of thing. I'll do it when I get home and can be bothered.

 As of this evening ex is still in Mexico because MIL checked them in on Facebook to a restaurant (she has blocked me but the idiot hasn't blocked my sister). So either he is bluffing or he is heading home tomorrow.

As for my home security, he can't take anything other than his laptop, gaming system and his clothes/toiletries and kayak. That's all he has at my house. My brother has this list and knows if he does start packing anything more than that to start recording it and call the police. That being said I do not believe he is going to pack and go anywhere. I think he genuinely believes despite me spelling it out that once I get home and things settle I'll ""calm down"" and we will sort things out. 

And for the PP who said MIL would be high tailing it to Home Depot to get his room ready? No need - his room has not been touched since he moved in with me. Where else do you think he sleeps when he stays there the night? 

Okay - off to bed and feeling so much happier after spending the day with my girls.

I'm having an absolute blast! We're totally exhausted so having an early night tonight so we are able to hit up Cancun tomorrow night! 

I haven't heard from Ex but MIL checked in on facebook and tagged Ex at the airport with a status that said ""so sad its over :(""

Someone replied ""weren't you meant to be gone for another week or something?"" and she replied ""plans changed, heading back early but had SUCH a wonderful time with my wonderful SON."" Someone else then wrote ""you two make such a cute couple"" and like 20 people have 'liked' that comment including my sister. WE DIED! SO FUCKING FUNNY!

For those of you who said you feel sorry for him. So do I, but at the same time I'm pretty angry. He represented himself to me as a nice, normal, very charming and charasmatic guy. He swept me off my feet - I mean we met through mutual friends and he chased me for ages. When I finally agreed to a date he hired a limo and a private room in a restaurant - so he made me feel that women in his life were revered and that he couldn't wait to start a life with me. I feel he was dishonest when he failed to disclose that MIL was THE most important woman in his life, behind me, DD and any other females around the place. That makes me so mad at him, and also mad at her because what kind of a selfish cow raises her sons to be so entirely disfunctional and responsible for her happiness?

Earlier a PP described the scenario that led to them going home early. Him sulking, which would have irritated MIL to no end because in her eyes he should have been more than happy with her company. MIL then would have made a crack about going home early, he would have said fine and then because MIL is stubborn she would have done it. I honestly think something like that happened.

Regarding turning Ex's bedroom into a guest room at her home. She has a five bedroom house. It's ridiculous. She bounces around in that thing like a marble in a mason jar. She has her room, a crafts room, two guest bedrooms and Ex's room. She has made jokes about converting one of the guest bedrooms into a nursery for her grandchildren. Ohhhh how SIL and I LOL'd at that one. She argued that my mother has a room for DD, and she is right, she does, but my parents are kind, supportive, respectful and the room is not ""DD's"" room exclusively, it is just ""her room"" when she stays over, if that makes sense?

 

Finally, you've all got my brother totally wrong. He is tall, scrawny and totally awkward and he would DIE if I shared that photo of him. For the record he was wearing boxers.

If you were going to cast someone in a movie to play my brother, you'd definitely go with McLovin.

I agree. He is in for a rude awakening.

I've already started mentally rehearsing what I'm going to say when I see him.

How about: ""oh I'm glad you're here, I wanted to give you your ring back and you've just saved me a trip to your mother's house to deliver it."" 

Orrrr

""What part of 'I want you out of my house' did you not understand?"" 

Thoughts?

I also think there will be an inevitable run in with MIL so I'm rehearsing for that too. I'm thinking ""so have you and ex set a date for your wedding yet?"" is my favorite.

And... the rug sweeping messages continue!

Ex: ""Just letting you know 'brother' hadn't put the trash out the whole time he has been here so I took care of it, and some bills came so I paid them.""

Right, so a PA complaint about my brother being a pig and confirmation he is going through my mail...

ExMIL: ""hope you have a safe flight back, I'd love if you could swing by for coffee when you're home so we can put this silliness behind us.""

Yeah. I don't think so lady.

But recently, the hero association had assigned you a partner. A mysterious vigilante is bound to your patrols Skilled, daring, irritatingly familiar. There’s something about the way they move, the way they speak. It's starting to gnaw at you, there's even the slightest hint of attraction towards the vigilante that has been partnered with you. Even at home you cannot shake the sense that you know this strange vigilante. 



(Hey there, I'm Jacob, a 24-year-old writer looking for a creative partner to collaborate on a prompt I’ve come up with. I enjoy writing romantic slice-of-life stories with a touch of action, adventure, and a good dose of drama to keep things engaging.

I consider myself an advanced writer, I love world-building and crafting characters that evolve over time and overcome their flaws. I love to put effort into the details that bring a story to life, whether it's exploring relationships, creating tension, or building a setting. My replies typically range from 2-4 detailed paragraphs, either moving the plot forward or delving into the current scene to add depth.
I’m looking for a cooperative writing partner. Someone who is comfortable with contributing to the story, not just a passive participant. I want to build a world together, bounce ideas back and forth, and make the experience enjoyable for both of us.

If this sounds like your kind of jam, feel free to send me a message! I’d love to discuss ideas and see if we’d be a good creative match.
Looking forward to writing with you!
Thanks,
Jacob.)",1,1768732597.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

Drop your link and I'll do yours free.","I've been pulling patterns from Google reviews for the past few weeks. Not reading them one by one, but finding what businesses actually miss.

Some things that made me go ""wait, what?""

The Hoxton Chicago charges $400/night for rooms where the L train literally shakes the walls. Fifteen reviews mention it. Zero soundproofing. Zero discount. Just... ignored.

Dalla Terra Wine Bar has one manager: ""the guy in a suit"", mentioned in 8 reviews as rude and dismissive. That's not a training issue. That's a personnel issue killing a 4.3-star business.

Wall Two 80 has customers saying ""best coffee in Balaclava"" 24 times. Their Google Business description? Generic. They're not using the exact language that drives local search.

PureGym Liverpool: broken AC for 30+ days, gym hitting 30 degrees, management ghosted members on timeline. People canceling memberships and writing 1-star reviews about being ignored.

Razza Pizza: people drive 45 minutes and call it ""life-changing."" But 12 reviews say burnt crusts at $30/pie. The messaging says ""artisan wood-fired."" The reviews says ""inconsistent execution."" That's a positioning-reality gap.

What I'm learning:

1. Voice of customer is sitting in plain sight

South Lake Chalet guests mention ""walkability to beach"" 22 times. It's not in their listing title. That's the primary decision factor and they're not leading with it.

2. Surface complaints hide the real opportunities

""This gym is crowded"" = ""not enough bench presses at peak hours"" (12 mentions)

""This hotel is loud"" = ""L train rooms need discount pricing""

The real insight is always one layer deeper.

3. Differentiation already exists in reviews

Snowy Owl Cafe: ""Authentic Peruvian empanadas"" mentioned 12x. That's differentiation in a saturated coffee market.

Barry's WeHo: Instructor playlist curation mentioned 15x. That's a specific competitive advantage, not just ""good music.""

Most businesses never extract these positioning anchors because they're reading for sentiment, not strategy.

Why I'm doing this:

I'm building [Kairo](https://kairo.so), a tool that pulls this intelligence from reviews automatically. Analyzed 11 businesses, 5,000+ reviews so far.

Workflow is automated, but I manually QA every report to make sure insights are actually useful (not just sentiment scores and quote dumps).

Trying to answer: What positioning should you lead with? What customer language should be in copy? What operational fix has highest ROI? What's the real reason customers choose competitors?

Currently works with Google Business Profile reviews. Planning to add more platforms (Yelp, TripAdvisor, Airbnb, Amazon, Reddit, etc.) based on what people actually want, trying to avoid building features no one needs.

Drop a Google Maps link + what you want to know:

Why customers choose competitors

What language should be in messaging

What differentiation exists but isn't leveraged

What operational fixes would move the needle

I'll run it through Kairo and share the patterns.

Free. Testing what's valuable.

2- kingrinder specific experiences from the community and best practices (specially french press in mind)

3- beans resting period and how long can we keep and best practices for keeping them. since I want to use different flavour parallel.

I’m genuinely looking for advice and help, because I feel like I’ve hit a wall and could really use an outside perspective.



What I’m trying to achieve



I’m aiming for a classic European bar-style espresso, not modern or fruity, with a very specific profile:

	•	Very low to near-zero acidity

	•	Full, clearly defined body — compact and clean, not heavy or muddy

	•	Core flavours: chocolate, cocoa, nuts, maybe a soft caramel edge

	•	No fruity or floral notes



Impact & drinkability matter a lot:

I’m looking for an espresso with an immediate “hit” on the first sip, but not aggressive or sharp.

A flavour with presence and character, yet easy to drink.



Aftertaste is critical:

	•	Long, clean, persistent aftertaste

	•	Chocolate-nutty, stable and smooth

	•	No drying, ashy or harsh bitterness

	•	Most importantly: a taste that makes you want another espresso, not one that exhausts you



This is our defined reference profile, and I’m trying to understand whether this is realistically achievable with current coffees and roasting styles.



⸻



The recurring problem



Over the past months I’ve tested many coffees (intentionally not naming roasters to avoid negative publicity), mostly Arabica / Robusta blends from European roasteries, in the following ratios:

	•	70/30

	•	80/20

	•	90/10 (Arabica-forward)



I’m based and working in Europe, so the context is firmly European espresso culture, not US/AU-style profiles.



No matter the ratio or dialing, the recurring issue is noticeable bitterness, even when everything looks technically correct.



⸻



Current setup (exact, no omissions)

	•	Machine: Oracle Jet

	•	Grinder (current): Helios 65 flat burrs

	•	Next stage: Fiorenzato F83

	•	Final stage: ACS Vostok – latest model lever machine

	•	Basket: IMS Competition, 18 g

	•	Puck screen: Normcore 58.5 mm espresso puck screen, 0.8 mm thickness, round center hole, 316 stainless steel

	•	Prep: ARO WDT (thorough loosening and distribution)

	•	Tamp: Normcore C4 (level, consistent pressure)



⸻



Reference recipe (very repeatable)

	•	Dose: 16 g in

	•	Yield: \~26 g out (≈ 1:1.6)

	•	Time: \~25–27 seconds

	•	Visually clean extraction, stable flow, good crema



⸻



What has already been tested thoroughly

	•	Grind size micro-adjusted both finer and coarser

	•	Brew temperature from 90 °C to 93 °C (all tested)

	•	Slightly shorter and slightly longer yields

	•	Stable pressure and flow



Observed behaviour:

	•	Finer → bitterness becomes more aggressive

	•	Coarser → bitterness softens slightly, but remains clearly present

	•	Lower temperature helps marginally, but the improvement is subtle



At this point it feels like the bitterness is structural, not a dialing issue.



⸻



Why I’m asking now



This matters because of the machine path:

	•	If a coffee tastes balanced and open on the Oracle Jet, I expect it to become even better on a lever machine like the Vostok.

	•	If it already tastes bitter, closed and lacking clear flavour definition or aftertaste on the Jet, a lever machine will usually amplify those traits even more.



That’s why I want to understand the root cause before moving forward.



⸻



My honest questions

	•	Is this more likely a roast profile issue (too developed / too dark)?

	•	A green coffee or blend composition issue, especially how Robusta is used in European blends?

	•	Or is the expectation of a low-bitterness, impactful yet drinkable bar-style espresso simply unrealistic with many modern European roasts?



I’m not chasing acidity or fruit — just a clean, dense, traditional espresso with a long, pleasant aftertaste, without harsh bitterness.



Any insight from people who’ve chased a similar profile would be greatly appreciated.

Anyway I am thinking and practising which device is a better host PC in my use case.

I want to stream Steam games and Xbox games from home to coffee shop when I do not want to carry the ROG Ally X to the coffee shop because of all other heavy things which I need to carry.

My Game PC has a RTX4090D and so yes it is powerful. But in order to stream game it has to be turned on all the day and also the monitor has to be turned on. For it to run AAA games like Cyberpunk 2077, it is hot.

ROG Ally X of course if much less powerful than the Game PC and so it runs AAA games in low settings only. Even for CB2077 it does not generate too much heat and I feel more comfortable having it  turned on all the day, compare to the much more expensive Game PC and the RTX4090D.

For the purpose of game streaming , I think the difference between the powerful RTX4090D and the internet graphics ROG Ally X is not large? OR I am totally wrong that even the ""streaming"" ability can benefit a lot by using RTX4090D instead of the internal graphics chip of ROG Ally X even I am only using 1080p or even 720p on my client device (which may be just a Samsung Android phone)?

I’m a Canadian guy in my late 20s heading to Marrakech soon and starting my Morocco trip there. Thought I’d post here in case anyone’s around or planning something similar.

I don’t have a rigid itinerary — more interested in:
	•	Exploring local neighborhoods and the medina
	•	Food spots, cafés, markets, and chill rooftop views
	•	Smoking shisha, people-watching, and relaxed evenings
	•	Meeting people and seeing the city beyond the usual tourist checklist

Down to do some sightseeing during the day, but equally happy just wandering, grabbing mint tea, and seeing where the day goes.

If you’re:
	•	Another traveler starting or passing through Marrakech
	•	Someone already in the city
	•	Or a local who’s open to hanging out / showing cool spots

Would be great to link up — even if it’s just for coffee, shisha, or a walk through the medina.

I’m easygoing, respectful, and happy to cover my share (or pitch in for food, transport, activities, etc.). Mostly just looking for good company and a genuine experience.

Comment or DM if you’re interested. Always down to meet new people.

Cheers!
