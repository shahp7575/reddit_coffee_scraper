Mind. Blown. ü§Ø Thought I'd share my take on some seriously amazing countries for anyone planning their first Asia adventure!

**Thailand üáπüá≠**  
Honestly? The perfect starter pack for Asia! Super tourist-friendly, AMAZING food (pad thai for $1? yes please!), and the locals are just incredibly sweet. Plus, you get everything - temples, beaches, mountains, and crazy good night markets. Bangkok's chaos is like a warm hug once you get used to it!

**Japan üáØüáµ**  
Warning: You might never want to leave! Everything just... works. The convenience stores are better than some restaurants back home, and don't get me started on their bullet trains! Sure, it's pricier, but the culture shock (in the best way) is worth every penny. Plus, Japanese people are literally the most helpful humans ever.

**Vietnam üáªüá≥**  
Your money goes SO far here! The food scene is insane (I'm still dreaming about their coffee), and the country is like a geography highlight reel - from Ha Long Bay to mountain villages in Sapa. Pro tip: Learn to cross the road with confidence amid the sea of scooters üòÖ

**South Korea üá∞üá∑**  
It's like stepping into the future but with amazing street food! Seoul's energy is unmatched - from traditional temples to ultra-modern cafes on the same street. The subway system is a dream, and Korean BBQ will ruin all other BBQs for you forever.

**Malaysia üá≤üáæ**  
Seriously underrated! Amazing mix of cultures (and OMG THE FOOD!), modern cities, ancient rainforests, and chill islands. Plus, English is widely spoken, making it super easy to navigate. Kuala Lumpur's food courts changed my life!

Quick Tips:

* Download Grab (Asian Uber) before you go
* Google Maps offline download = lifesaver
* Local SIM cards are usually super cheap
* Street food > Restaurant food (usually!)
* Learn basic local greetings (people appreciate it!)

What's your take? Which Asian country stole your heart? Or if you haven't been yet, which one's top of your bucket list and why? Also, did I miss any countries that should totally be on this list?

1h26w62,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h26w62/wires_and_chains_part_one/,Wires and Chains: Part One,"Hello everyone, this is Glenn Matsuri once again.

I realize I didn‚Äôt properly introduce myself the last time, when I shared my account of the Piper. Which you can read here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/8X0s4glHZx For that experience, I wrote everything after the fact, neatly tying together the threads of a story that had already ended. But what I am about to share with you now is different. While it‚Äôs all over now, what you‚Äôre about to read began as my account in real time, as it happened.

After my confrontation with the cult of Moloch and the strange peace I found in its wake, I couldn‚Äôt ignore the truth anymore: the world is not what it seems. I saw firsthand how thin the veil between the ordinary and the extraordinary truly is. I learned how deep and tangled the roots of the unknown could grow.

And once you‚Äôve seen those things, you can‚Äôt look away.

That experience changed me. It haunted me, yes, but it also ignited something‚Äîa need to understand, to dig deeper, to uncover what else might be hidden in the shadows. So I‚Äôve set out once again, driven by that same curiosity and, perhaps, a need for answers I‚Äôll never truly find.

This story isn‚Äôt about the Piper. It‚Äôs about something else entirely. Something that lives in the spaces we think we control but never really do.

This is my account of what I‚Äôve found. 

I spent days searching, chasing shadows and whispers, and every lead dissolved into nothing. The world felt smaller than it should, its mysteries shriveling under my scrutiny. Forums buzzed with nonsense. Blogs recycled the same tired tales of hauntings, cryptids, and rituals. Nothing had teeth‚Äînothing was real.

Frustration gnawed at me. Hours spent staring at my screen, poring over meaningless threads. Each dead end fed a creeping doubt: had my experience with the Piper and Moloch been some cruel anomaly? Was I chasing something that no longer wanted to be found?

It was during one of these aimless afternoons, sitting in a coffee shop, that I finally stumbled across something. Or maybe it stumbled across me.

I wasn‚Äôt paying attention at first, my focus blurred by caffeine and exhaustion. But out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a girl sitting a few tables away. She had a laptop in front of her, a cup of tea untouched beside it. Nothing unusual, really‚Äîat least not at first glance.

But something about her stillness caught my attention. She wasn‚Äôt typing or scrolling. Her hands rested flat on the table, her eyes locked on the screen.

I tried to brush it off. People get lost in their devices all the time. But the longer I watched her, the more unsettled I felt. Her face was expressionless, her breathing slow and shallow, as if she wasn‚Äôt entirely there.

Instinct took over. I stood, pretending to stretch, and casually moved closer to her table. She didn‚Äôt look up, didn‚Äôt react at all, her eyes glued to the screen.

The screen.

I tilted my head slightly, catching a glimpse. At first, I thought it was just a website, but the longer I looked, the more wrong it felt. The background was pale, almost white, and the text‚Äîif you could call it that‚Äîwasn‚Äôt in any language I recognized. Jagged, angular symbols scrolled endlessly, shifting in patterns that made my eyes ache.

There was a faint hum, so soft I almost didn‚Äôt notice it, pressing at the edges of my hearing. A low, static buzz that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once.

The girl‚Äôs hands twitched slightly, her fingers brushing the table. Her breathing hitched for a moment, then steadied again. But she didn‚Äôt look away.

I felt a chill crawl up my spine, a deep, instinctual sense of wrongness.

I didn‚Äôt stay long. I didn‚Äôt confront her or ask questions‚ÄîI just left, my mind racing.

At first, I tried to convince myself it was nothing. Maybe she was just zoned out, hypnotized by some weird video or obscure internet project. But the feeling stuck with me, that whisper of static at the back of my skull.

And then I started seeing it again.

It wasn‚Äôt everywhere, not all the time, but it was enough. A man sitting on a park bench, staring at his phone with that same vacant expression, his screen glowing faintly with the same jagged symbols. A teenager on the subway, their laptop balanced on their knees, their fingers motionless on the keyboard. A woman in a grocery store, standing frozen in the middle of an aisle, her phone dangling loosely in her hand.

Every time, the same stillness. The same hollow gaze. The same faint, suffocating hum that I could feel more than hear.

It wasn‚Äôt just my imagination.

Something was happening.

And I had to know what.

The more I saw these people, the more obsessed I became. They weren‚Äôt hard to find if I paid attention‚Äîthose glazed-over stares, the unnerving stillness. But what unsettled me most was that they didn‚Äôt completely withdraw from the world.

They still interacted with it, in their way. A man in the park stood up eventually, shuffled to a nearby trash can to throw away a soda can, and then returned to his bench. A teenager on the subway snapped their laptop shut when their stop came and exited with the crowd, moving with a mechanical rhythm. The woman at the grocery store eventually left her aisle and checked out, scanning her items with an eerie precision.

It was like they were running on autopilot, performing the basic functions of life with just enough coherence to pass as normal. But they weren‚Äôt normal. I couldn‚Äôt explain it, but I felt it‚Äîsomething vital was missing, like their spark had been snuffed out.

Eventually, I decided I couldn‚Äôt just watch anymore. I had to talk to one of them.

She was sitting outside a coffee shop, her laptop open on the table, the same glazed look on her face. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, twitching slightly but never pressing a key. I could hear the faint hum again, that static pressure crawling up the back of my skull.

I hesitated, unsure how to approach her. But then I forced myself to take a deep breath and walked over. ‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice light.

She didn‚Äôt respond.

I stepped closer. ‚ÄúHey, are you okay?‚Äù

This time, she moved. Slowly, almost reluctantly, her head turned toward me. Her eyes met mine, and I felt a chill run through me. They were blank‚Äîno curiosity, no irritation, no recognition. Just a dull, empty gaze.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù she said, her voice flat and mechanical.

Her answer wasn‚Äôt what unsettled me. It was how she said it. There was no inflection, no emotion, like she was reading from a script.

‚ÄúWhat are you working on?‚Äù I asked, gesturing toward her laptop.

She blinked, her expression not changing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a project.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of project?‚Äù

‚ÄúA personal one.‚Äù

Her responses were clipped, vague, like she was deflecting without even trying to. I glanced down at her screen and saw the same strange symbols scrolling across it. My heart pounded in my chest.

‚ÄúCan I see?‚Äù I asked, forcing a casual tone.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Her hand moved slightly, shielding the laptop from my view. For the first time, there was something in her tone‚Äîan edge of resistance, though it was faint.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I pressed. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ it looks interesting.‚Äù

She hesitated, her gaze flickering back to the screen. Her fingers twitched again, and then, to my surprise, she nodded. ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

She turned the laptop toward me, and the symbols on the screen seemed to pulse faintly, shifting faster now that I was looking at them. My eyes ached, and the hum grew louder, buzzing in my skull.

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúA site,‚Äù she said simply.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it called?‚Äù

Her lips parted slightly, and for a moment, I thought she wouldn‚Äôt answer. But then she said it, her voice barely a whisper: ‚ÄúWireWeave.‚Äù

WireWeave. The name felt cold and sharp, like something that didn‚Äôt belong in my mouth.

‚ÄúWhere did you find it?‚Äù I asked, but she didn‚Äôt respond. Her gaze drifted back to the screen, her blank stare returning.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said, louder this time.

She flinched slightly, as if I‚Äôd startled her. Then she turned the laptop away from me, her fingers brushing the keyboard with mechanical precision.

‚ÄúI have to go,‚Äù she said, her voice hollow again.

Before I could say anything else, she closed the laptop, stood up, and walked away, her movements slow but deliberate. I didn‚Äôt follow her. My mind was too busy reeling from what I‚Äôd just seen and heard.

WireWeave.

Whatever was happening to these people, whatever was pulling them into that hollow, glazed state, it was connected to that site.

And now I had a name.

The room was dark, save for the faint glow of my computer screen. The only sounds were the hum of the fan and the occasional creak of the old wooden desk beneath my elbows. The city outside was quiet, muffled by the hour, leaving me alone with the unsettling silence that always seemed to creep in when I was at my most vulnerable.

The name WireWeave echoed in my mind as I typed it into the search bar. My fingers hesitated over the keys, a faint tremor running through them. I couldn‚Äôt explain why, but I felt as though I was about to open a door I couldn‚Äôt close.

The first search results were useless. Generic tech blogs, knitting tutorials, even some links to outdated forum posts. Nothing remotely related to what I was looking for. I refined the search, adding terms like ‚Äúsymbols,‚Äù ‚Äúglazed,‚Äù ‚Äúunusual website.‚Äù Still nothing.

Frustration mounted as the hours dragged on. I scrolled through endless pages, my eyes burning from the glow of the screen. The silence around me grew heavier, more oppressive, and the faint buzz at the back of my skull‚Äîso subtle at first‚Äîstarted to grow louder.

And then I found it.

It wasn‚Äôt the site itself, not yet. It was an obscure blog post buried deep in a forgotten corner of the internet. The page was dated years ago, the formatting crude and broken, as though it hadn‚Äôt been touched in decades.

The title read: Naamah‚Äôs Paradise: A False Eden.

I felt a chill crawl up my spine as I clicked the link.

The post was rambling, fragmented, but one thing was clear: the author claimed to have encountered someone‚Äîor something‚Äîcalled Naamah. She was described as a being of extraordinary beauty and malice, offering an escape, a paradise, to those she touched. But it wasn‚Äôt real. It was a trap, a cage built from wires and chains, where the mind was ensnared and the soul consumed.

The author warned against searching for her, against following the whispers of her promise. But the post ended with a single, chilling line:

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve come this far, it‚Äôs already too late. You know the name of her paradise. WireWeave.‚Äù

My heart pounded in my chest as I scrolled further, and there it was: a link. No description, no explanation, just a simple, blue hyperlink glowing faintly on the screen.

I hesitated. Every instinct screamed at me to stop, to close the tab and walk away. But the buzz in my skull was louder now, insistent, almost alive. It felt like something was pushing me forward, urging me to click.

And I did.

The screen went black for a moment, then loaded into a stark, minimalistic website. The background was pale, almost white, and in the center of the screen was a single line of text:

‚ÄúWelcome to Paradise.‚Äù

Beneath it, symbols began to scroll across the page‚Äîjagged, angular, shifting constantly, just as I‚Äôd seen before. The hum in my head surged, sharp and relentless, as if the symbols themselves were drilling into my mind.

I couldn‚Äôt look away.

My fingers hovered over the keyboard, but I couldn‚Äôt type. The cursor blinked steadily in the empty search bar at the top, waiting for input, but my hands refused to move.

The buzz grew louder. It wasn‚Äôt just in my head anymore‚Äîit was everywhere. In the air, in the walls, vibrating through the floor beneath my feet.

The symbols pulsed, faster now, the screen flickering slightly as though something was trying to break through.

And then, I felt it.

A pull.

It wasn‚Äôt physical, not exactly, but it was undeniable. Like an invisible thread tugging at the back of my mind, pulling me closer to the screen. My vision blurred, the symbols on the page stretching and twisting into impossible shapes.

I tried to move, to push the chair back, to tear my eyes away, but my body wouldn‚Äôt respond. The buzz in my skull reached a deafening crescendo, and the screen seemed to expand, the pale background bleeding out into the edges of my vision.

I was falling.

The world around me‚Äîthe desk, the room, the hum of the fan‚Äîall dissolved into static.

And then, there was nothing.

The first thing I felt was wet.

Not just damp‚Äîwet. Gooey, slick, and clinging to my skin like some horrible second layer. My body was submerged, floating in a thick, viscous liquid that coated every inch of me. The sensation was suffocating, and when I tried to move, I couldn‚Äôt. My arms and legs were stuck, my movements sluggish and weak, as if the liquid itself resisted me.

I opened my eyes‚Äîor at least, I thought I did. The world around me was blurred, hazy, and strangely pixelated. Shapes shimmered at the edges of my vision, jagged and incomplete, as if they were struggling to take form.

I blinked again, and slowly, the details began to emerge.

I was in a cave. The walls were jagged and dark, dripping with moisture. The air was thick and heavy, with an unsettling, almost metallic tang. Around me, massive clusters of spider eggs clung to the walls and floor, their translucent shells pulsating faintly with an eerie glow.

And then I saw the vat.

I wasn‚Äôt just submerged‚ÄîI was trapped in a large, gooey vat at the center of the cave, surrounded by dozens of others. Most were empty, their viscous contents pooled on the ground, but a few held strange, shadowy forms‚Äîfigures that seemed human, but flickered and glitched as though struggling to stay solid.

The realization hit me like a punch to the gut. I wasn‚Äôt in my apartment anymore.

Panic surged as I thrashed against the substance holding me in place. It was sticky and resistant, like some kind of organic glue, and every movement felt like it was dragging me deeper into its grip. My breath came in short, panicked gasps, and I realized I wasn‚Äôt breathing air‚Äîit was something else, something thick and wrong.

And then the rendering began.

The cave seemed to ripple, the edges of the walls shimmering as if I were looking at them through heatwaves. Textures slid into place, details sharpening and solidifying. The faint hum I‚Äôd heard in my apartment was louder now, vibrating through my body as the world snapped into focus piece by piece.

I wasn‚Äôt just in the computer. I was part of it.

I don‚Äôt know how long I was stuck there, unable to move, the reality of my situation sinking in like cold water. The eggs around me pulsed, their faint glow growing brighter, casting flickering shadows across the cave walls.

I was on the verge of giving up when I heard footsteps.

They were faint at first, echoing from somewhere beyond the vat. Then they grew louder, more purposeful. A figure emerged from the shadows‚Äîa man, tall and broad, with a rough, unkempt beard and sharp eyes that darted around the cave like he was searching for something. He was clad in a mix of leather and what looked like salvaged metal armor, and he carried a rusted sword at his side.

Behind him, a woman followed, her movements graceful and deliberate. Her hair was tied back in a loose braid, and she wore a cloak that shimmered faintly in the dim light. Her eyes locked onto mine as she stepped closer, and I saw a flicker of recognition in her expression.

‚ÄúAnother one,‚Äù she said softly.

The man‚ÄîGregory, as I would later learn‚Äîapproached the vat and studied me with a critical eye. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs stuck. Looks fresh.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet him out,‚Äù the woman‚ÄîTianna‚Äîreplied, her voice calm but insistent.

Gregory grunted, drawing a knife from his belt. He plunged it into the goo, slicing through the sticky substance with practiced precision. I felt the tension around me loosen as the liquid began to drain, spilling onto the ground with a sickening squelch.

‚ÄúBreathe,‚Äù Gregory said as he hauled me out, his grip firm but not rough. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll feel like hell for a minute, but you‚Äôll adjust.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt wrong. The first breath I took felt like fire in my lungs, and I doubled over, coughing and gasping. The air tasted strange, metallic and synthetic, but it was breathable.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äî‚Äù I croaked, my voice raw. ‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù

Tianna crouched beside me, her gaze steady and unflinching. ‚ÄúWelcome to paradise,‚Äù she said, the faintest hint of sarcasm in her voice.

It took time to collect myself, to stand on shaky legs and process what they told me.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre inside it,‚Äù Gregory explained, gesturing vaguely to the cave around us. ‚ÄúThe website. WireWeave. When you went too deep, it pulled you in. Same thing happened to us.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long‚Äî‚Äù I started, but Gregory shook his head.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTime doesn‚Äôt work right here. Could‚Äôve been days, could‚Äôve been years.‚Äù

I looked at Tianna, hoping for something more concrete, but she only nodded.

‚ÄúWhat about our bodies?‚Äù I asked, the question slipping out before I could stop myself. ‚ÄúThe people I‚Äôve seen‚Äîoutside. They‚Äôre still walking around, still there. How is that possible?‚Äù

Tianna frowned, her expression darkening. ‚ÄúThe bodies stay behind. They keep moving, keep functioning. But they‚Äôre not them anymore. They‚Äôre shells. Puppets.‚Äù

‚ÄúPuppets for who?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor her,‚Äù Tianna said, her voice dropping to a whisper. ‚ÄúNaamah. She takes the soul, the essence, and leaves the rest behind to spread her influence. The more people she takes, the stronger she gets.‚Äù

Tianna leaned against the wall, her arms crossed. ‚ÄúAnd now you‚Äôre part of it too. Congratulations.‚Äù

The weight of their words settled on me like a stone. I wasn‚Äôt just trapped. I was part of something far larger, far darker than I‚Äôd ever imagined.

And I had no idea how to escape.

The cave felt alive, and not in a comforting way. Every sound‚Äîevery drip of moisture, every faint skitter‚Äîechoed through the oppressive darkness like a warning. The faint glow from the pulsating eggs scattered across the walls did nothing to ease the tension. If anything, it made the shadows seem darker, shifting and stretching like they had a life of their own.

‚ÄúQuiet,‚Äù Gregory hissed, glancing back at me as he sheathed his blade. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll hear us.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe?‚Äù I whispered, barely able to make my voice work.

Tianna glanced at me, her face tight. ‚ÄúMama Webster. The one who keeps this place in order. She doesn‚Äôt like intrusions.‚Äù

My stomach twisted. ‚ÄúMama‚Ä¶ Webster?‚Äù

Gregory nodded grimly. ‚ÄúGiant spider. Biggest thing you‚Äôve ever seen. Smart, too. She patrols the vats, makes sure the new arrivals stay put until it‚Äôs time for‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off, his jaw tightening.

‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù I asked, though I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to know.

‚ÄúUntil she drags them away,‚Äù Tianna said, her voice low. ‚ÄúWhere she takes them, we don‚Äôt know. But they don‚Äôt come back.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, the sticky residue still clinging to my skin making me feel claustrophobic. ‚ÄúAnd you were checking the vats? For me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt like leaving people behind,‚Äù Gregory said. ‚ÄúNot if we can help it. Most of them‚Ä¶‚Äù He paused, grimacing. ‚ÄúMost of them don‚Äôt make it out. But every now and then, someone like you pops up. Someone worth saving.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt thank us yet,‚Äù Tianna muttered, glancing around the cave. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still in her nest.‚Äù

Gregory motioned for us to follow. ‚ÄúStay close, move quiet. Don‚Äôt look at the eggs too long‚Äîthey‚Äôll‚Ä¶ move if you stare.‚Äù

My legs felt like jelly, but I forced myself to follow, my bare feet squelching against the damp floor. The air was thick and stifling, filled with an unnatural heaviness that made every breath feel like a struggle.

We moved in silence, weaving through the narrow passages between clusters of glowing eggs. The goo on the floor clung to everything, making every step a gamble. The faint hum I‚Äôd felt in my skull earlier was still there, growing sharper, like a distant swarm of bees.

‚ÄúWhy does she patrol?‚Äù I whispered, unable to shake the feeling that eyes were watching us from the dark.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a guard,‚Äù Tianna said without looking back. ‚ÄúFor this place. For Naamah.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd Naamah‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice faltered. ‚ÄúShe controls her?‚Äù

‚ÄúMore like uses her,‚Äù Gregory said, his voice bitter. ‚ÄúMama Webster is part of the system, same as us. But she‚Äôs different. Bigger. Meaner. And she doesn‚Äôt have a problem following orders.‚Äù

‚ÄúQuiet,‚Äù Tianna snapped suddenly, holding up a hand.

We froze, my heart pounding in my chest.

Somewhere in the distance, I heard it‚Äîa soft, wet skittering sound, like legs dragging through muck. It was faint at first, but it grew louder, closer, echoing off the walls.

‚ÄúBack,‚Äù Gregory mouthed, gesturing to a crevice in the cave wall.

We pressed ourselves into the shadows, the space barely large enough to hold the three of us. My breath caught as the skittering grew deafening, accompanied by a faint clicking sound, rhythmic and sharp.

And then I saw her.

She emerged from the darkness, a massive, hulking shape that barely fit in the tunnel. Her legs were long and spindly, each one coated in the same viscous goo that filled the vats. Her body was bulbous, pulsating faintly with the same glow as the eggs. But it was her face‚Äîher eyes‚Äîthat made my blood run cold.

Eight glossy black orbs dotted her head, but they weren‚Äôt lifeless. They darted back and forth, scanning the room with an unnatural intelligence. Her mandibles clicked rhythmically as she dragged her enormous body forward, her legs scraping against the walls.

My chest tightened as I realized she wasn‚Äôt just patrolling‚Äîshe was searching.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move,‚Äù Tianna whispered, her voice barely audible.

Mama Webster stopped near the vats, her massive head swiveling as she inspected them. One of her legs reached out, tapping the edge of an empty vat with a soft, deliberate motion. The sound echoed in the silence, a rhythmic tap, tap, tap that made my skin crawl.

Gregory‚Äôs hand gripped my shoulder, steadying me as I trembled.

The spider paused, her head cocking slightly as if listening. I held my breath, my heart thundering in my chest. She lingered for what felt like an eternity before finally moving on, her massive body disappearing into the shadows with a final, wet scrape.

We stayed frozen for several long moments, the silence around us almost as suffocating as her presence had been.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gone,‚Äù Gregory whispered finally, his voice low and tense. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs move.‚Äù

The rest of the escape was a blur of tension and exhaustion. Every shadow felt like her return, every sound a warning of her approach. When we finally emerged into the open air, the sharp coldness hit me like a slap.

I collapsed onto the damp ground, gasping for breath. Gregory and Tianna stood nearby, scanning the horizon for any sign of pursuit.

‚ÄúCongratulations,‚Äù Gregory said dryly, sheathing his knife. ‚ÄúYou survived Mama Webster‚Äôs nest. That‚Äôs more than most can say.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre not safe yet,‚Äù Tianna said, her voice sharp. ‚ÄúWe need to keep moving. She doesn‚Äôt leave the cave, but this world has other predators.‚Äù

I sat up, the weight of their words sinking in. My mind was spinning, trying to process what I‚Äôd just seen, what I‚Äôd just survived.

I looked around, and despite everything‚Äîthe terror of the cave, the impossible reality of this digital prison‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt help but marvel at the beauty of the land.

The sun was just beginning to rise, casting a soft, golden light over the forest. Trees towered above us, their leaves swaying gently in the breeze. Shafts of sunlight pierced through the canopy, illuminating the forest floor in patches of warm glow. Birds chirped in the distance, their songs intertwining with the faint rustle of leaves. A river wound its way through the valley below, glimmering like liquid silver in the morning light.

It was hard to believe that something so serene could exist in the same world as the horrors we‚Äôd just escaped.

‚ÄúKeep moving,‚Äù Gregory said, his voice breaking through my thoughts. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let the view distract you. This place may look beautiful, but it‚Äôs still a trap.‚Äù

Tianna nodded, her eyes scanning the road ahead. ‚ÄúThe forest has its own dangers. Keep your guard up.‚Äù

We followed a dirt path that wound its way through the trees, the ground soft and damp beneath our boots. The forest felt alive, almost too alive, as if the world itself was watching us.

As we rounded a bend, I spotted three figures walking toward us. Two women and a child.

One of the women caught my eye immediately. She was unlike anything I‚Äôd ever seen. Her features were sharp and feline, her ears pointed and covered in soft fur, her pupils slitted like a cat‚Äôs. Her tail swayed lazily behind her as she walked. She wore a patchwork cloak over leather armor, her bare feet padding softly on the dirt road.

The other woman looked more human, though her clothing was just as worn and travel-stained. She carried a small pack on her back and a wooden staff in one hand. The child clung to her side, their wide eyes darting between us as we approached.

The feline woman raised a hand in greeting, her lips curling into a sharp smile. ‚ÄúGood morning, travelers,‚Äù she said, her voice thick with an accent I couldn‚Äôt place. ‚ÄúYou look weary. Perhaps you would like to trade?‚Äù

I hesitated, glancing at Gregory and Tianna.

‚ÄúGo ahead,‚Äù Tianna whispered, leaning close to me. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre NPCs. For lack of a better term.‚Äù

‚ÄúNPCs?‚Äù I whispered back.

‚ÄúNon-player characters,‚Äù she said, her voice barely audible. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not like us. They‚Äôre part of the system, part of this world. Think of them as‚Ä¶ scripted. They‚Äôll follow certain behaviors, say certain things. But they‚Äôre not real‚Äînot like we are.‚Äù

Despite her words, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that they were real. The feline woman‚Äôs gaze was sharp, intelligent. The child clinging to the human woman looked nervous, uncertain, like they were truly afraid.

‚ÄúDo you need anything?‚Äù the feline woman asked, her head tilting slightly. Her accent was melodic, rolling off her tongue in a way that was both foreign and familiar.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù I began, unsure of what to say.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have anything to trade,‚Äù Gregory said, stepping forward. His tone was curt, dismissive, but the feline woman didn‚Äôt seem offended.

‚ÄúPity,‚Äù she said, her tail flicking behind her. ‚ÄúSafe travels, then. Watch the road ahead. Not all who walk it are friendly.‚Äù

With that, the three of them continued down the path, their footsteps fading into the distance.

‚ÄúNPCs,‚Äù I murmured again, still trying to wrap my head around it. ‚ÄúThey seemed‚Ä¶ alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not,‚Äù Tianna said, her tone flat. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre part of the trap. This world is built to feel real, to keep you here. The NPCs are just another layer of the illusion. Don‚Äôt let it fool you.‚Äù

But as I watched the child glance back at us one last time before disappearing into the forest, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if she was wrong.

The road wound deeper into the forest, the sunlight dimming as the canopy thickened overhead. The soft chirping of birds faded, replaced by an eerie stillness that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Every so often, I caught movement in the corner of my eye‚Äîa branch swaying without wind, a shadow darting across the path‚Äîbut when I turned to look, there was nothing there.

We walked in silence, each of us on edge, until the trees parted to reveal a clearing. At its center stood a manor.

It was enormous, a sprawling structure of stone and dark wood that loomed over the surrounding forest. Ivy crept up its walls, and intricate carvings adorned the beams and columns. Despite its grandeur, there was something unsettling about it. The windows, tall and narrow, reflected the forest like dark, watching eyes. The air here was heavy, thick with the smell of damp earth and something faintly metallic.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd be stopping here,‚Äù Tianna muttered, her voice tense.

Gregory shrugged. ‚ÄúFigured it‚Äôd be worth a try.‚Äù

As we approached, something darted across the path ahead of us. It was a squirrel‚Äîor at least, it was trying to be. Its movements were jerky and unnatural, its limbs twitching erratically as it climbed a nearby tree.

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù I whispered, watching it scamper upward in stuttering bursts. Its fur was patchy, its body almost translucent in places, as if the rendering process hadn‚Äôt quite finished.

Tianna grimaced. ‚ÄúBugged,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt happens. The system isn‚Äôt perfect.‚Äù

The squirrel paused on a branch, turning to look at us. Its eyes were flat, black, and far too large for its face. It tilted its head, then let out a high-pitched screech that sounded distorted, as though the sound were coming from a broken speaker.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep moving,‚Äù Gregory said, his tone sharp.

We climbed the stone steps to the manor‚Äôs front door, an ornate piece of carved wood that looked as though it belonged in a royal palace. Gregory knocked, the sound echoing ominously.

For a long moment, there was no response. Then, the door creaked open, revealing a woman.

She was stunning‚Äîeasily the most beautiful woman I‚Äôd ever seen. Her features were delicate, her skin flawless, her hair a cascade of silvery gold that shimmered in the dim light. But what struck me most were her ears. Long and pointed, they swept back elegantly, marking her as something otherworldly.

‚ÄúGood afternoon,‚Äù she said, her voice soft and melodic. ‚ÄúHow can I help you?‚Äù

Gregory stepped forward. ‚ÄúIs Henry in?‚Äù

The woman nodded, her smile warm. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in the study. Please, come in.‚Äù

She stepped aside, gesturing for us to enter.

The entry hallway was grand, its high ceilings and polished floors gleaming in the faint light filtering through stained glass windows. The walls were lined with tapestries depicting scenes of battle and celebration, though the figures were subtly wrong‚Äîarms too long, faces blurred, poses stiff. A chandelier hung overhead, its crystals casting fractured rainbows across the room.

We stood there, waiting, as the woman disappeared deeper into the house.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Henry?‚Äù I asked, keeping my voice low.

‚ÄúAnother one of us,‚Äù Tianna said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been here a long time. Decades, maybe. He gave up on escaping a long time ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

Gregory leaned against the wall, crossing his arms. ‚ÄúHenry decided if we can‚Äôt get out, we might as well make the best of it. Built this place himself, married an NPC, even had kids. The whole happy family package.‚Äù

I blinked, struggling to process that. ‚ÄúHe married an NPC? Had kids? How does that even work?‚Äù

Tianna shrugged. ‚ÄúThe system lets you do it. The NPCs respond to him like they‚Äôre real. And the kids‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off, frowning. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not exactly normal, but they‚Äôre his. In a way.‚Äù

‚ÄúDespite everything,‚Äù Gregory added, ‚ÄúHenry can be counted on. He knows this world better than anyone. If we need help, he‚Äôll give it.‚Äù

I glanced around the entry hall, my unease growing. The grandeur of the place didn‚Äôt match the twisted world outside. It felt too perfect, too polished, like the system was trying too hard to make it seem real.

The sound of footsteps echoed down the hall, growing louder as someone approached.

‚ÄúBrace yourself,‚Äù Gregory said, his tone neutral. ‚ÄúHenry‚Äôs‚Ä¶ unique.‚Äù

The man who stepped into the room was Henry.

He was tall and broad-shouldered, with a warm, easy smile and an air of confidence that seemed entirely out of place in a world like this. His clothes were immaculate‚Äîa finely tailored vest over a crisp shirt‚Äîand his hair was neatly combed.

Behind him trailed seven children, all of them eerily well-behaved. They ranged in age from a toddling boy clutching a stuffed rabbit to an elegant young woman who couldn‚Äôt have been much younger than me. They filed into the room with perfect poise, their expressions cheerful and welcoming.

‚ÄúWelcome,‚Äù Henry said, his voice deep and friendly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always a pleasure to see new faces. Please, make yourselves at home.‚Äù

He shook Gregory‚Äôs hand with an ease that suggested long familiarity. ‚ÄúGood to see you again, Gregory. And Tianna.‚Äù

They nodded, polite but stiff. I could see it in their faces‚Äîsomething about this place, about Henry, made them uneasy.

‚ÄúThank you for letting us stay,‚Äù Gregory said, his tone careful.

Henry waved him off. ‚ÄúNonsense. You‚Äôre always welcome here. Besides, it‚Äôs not often we get new guests.‚Äù

He turned to me, his smile warm and genuine. ‚ÄúAnd you must be Glenn. Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre in good hands now. We‚Äôll take care of you.‚Äù

His children chimed in one by one, introducing themselves with practiced ease. Their names were quaint, old-fashioned‚ÄîMaple, Thistle, Ivy, Ash, Rowan, Fern, and little Alder. The older ones smiled politely, while the younger ones giggled and clung to their father‚Äôs legs.

They were‚Ä¶ normal. That was the only way to describe them. Perfectly, disarmingly normal.

And that was the unsettling part.

I couldn‚Äôt understand why it didn‚Äôt bother me, why their normalcy didn‚Äôt set my nerves on edge the way it clearly did for Gregory and Tianna. Gregory shifted uncomfortably, his jaw tight, while Tianna‚Äôs gaze darted from one child to the next as if she were expecting something to break the illusion.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll stay for a night,‚Äù Gregory said after a long pause. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs not too much trouble.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Henry said, clapping him on the back. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome to stay as long as you like. We have plenty of room, plenty of food. You‚Äôre safe here.‚Äù

Safe. The word hung in the air like a promise too good to be true.

Henry turned to me, his smile never wavering. ‚ÄúYou look like you could use a bath and some fresh clothes, my friend. It‚Äôs been a long journey, hasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

It was only then that I noticed how filthy I was. My clothes were ragged, stained with mud and the goo from the vat. My skin felt grimy, my hair matted. I must have looked like I‚Äôd crawled out of the earth itself.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ yeah, I could use that,‚Äù I admitted, suddenly self-conscious.

‚ÄúMaple,‚Äù Henry said, turning to his oldest daughter. ‚ÄúWould you help Glenn get settled?‚Äù

She stepped forward with a smile that was as warm and disarming as her father‚Äôs. Maple was just as beautiful as her mother, her features delicate and flawless. Her long, golden hair shimmered as she moved, and her presence was magnetic.

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFollow me, Glenn.‚Äù

The bath was in a grand, tiled room that felt like it belonged in a palace. The tub was enormous, carved from smooth stone, with steaming water that smelled faintly of lavender. Maple moved around the room with an effortless grace, gathering towels and soaps as I stood there, awkward and out of place.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll feel better after this,‚Äù she said, glancing at me with a knowing smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing how much a bath can change your perspective.‚Äù

She handed me a towel, her fingers brushing mine for just a moment longer than necessary. Her eyes lingered on me, and her smile widened.

‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù I asked, trying to fill the silence.

‚ÄúNineteen,‚Äù she said, her tone light.

I stared at her, trying to do the math. Nineteen years. Henry had been here long enough to not only give up on escaping but to build a life, to raise a family.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ incredible,‚Äù I said, struggling to find the words.

She laughed softly, a sound that was both innocent and alluring. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just life, Glenn. You‚Äôll see. This world isn‚Äôt so bad once you get used to it. There‚Äôs beauty here. Comfort.‚Äù

She stepped closer, her gaze locking with mine. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not so lonely.‚Äù

Her words hit me harder than I expected. I hadn‚Äôt realized how isolated I felt until that moment, how much I missed the simple connection of another person. She was beautiful, kind, warm. And for a fleeting moment, I wanted to believe her.

I smiled back, feeling a flicker of something I hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time.

That‚Äôs when it hit me.

This was the snare. The hook.

Her warmth, her beauty, her kindness‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt just natural. It was designed, calculated. She wasn‚Äôt just offering me comfort; she was offering me exactly what I wanted. What I needed.

I froze, my smile fading as the realization sank in. Her gaze didn‚Äôt waver, but I thought I saw something in her eyes‚Äîsomething sharp, almost predatory.

‚ÄúMaple,‚Äù I said carefully, stepping back. ‚ÄúThank you. I think I can take it from here.‚Äù

Her smile stayed, but the warmth in her eyes flickered, replaced by something else. Something cold.

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù she said, her voice still honey-sweet. ‚ÄúEnjoy your bath.‚Äù

She left the room, closing the door behind her with a soft click.

I stood there, staring at the steaming water, the weight of my loneliness pressing down on me. I didn‚Äôt know what scared me more‚Äîhow close I‚Äôd come to falling for it, or how much I still wanted to.

Now I am noticing what reminds me of exactly how the damn fistula started or at least the drainage after surgery so now I stuffed myself with gauze and peroxide again to be safe of any infection after months of things being fine.


WTF happened?


I looked at my butt in the mirror and the leakage seems to be coming from inside my anus where I can't see but flowing down the same path as the scar where surgery was done.


Did I possibly tear open the scar or is it possible I developed another fistula or recurrence in the same damn spot that was healed up fine just a few days ago?

All I know is casual wear around the house and work uniforms.

Now, I'm financially secure, and can afford to work on my weaknesses.

I went on a coffee and bookstore date a few weeks ago. I dressed in a pair of khakis and a black button up with a t-shirt underneath (main shirt was not buttoned). It was just a casual get-together, nothing serious. Just to spend time together. But she was for fucking gorgeous that I felt like I underdressed. I know she didn't try to put anything fancy on because I've seen her in those kinds of outfits, but she made me look like a make-a-wish kid. Now, I am absolutely smitten by her, so I could be overthinking this, but I do want to take her on bigger, better dates in the future, and I want to look like someone who deserves to be seen next to her. Seriously, I've gone farther than I ever should've been allowed to go with someone if her appearance.

She saw nothing wrong with what I wore, but I could still step my game up.

I'm a 5'8"" male, not large but I do have a few extra pounds that I'm working off. Beard and longer hair.

1h26ube,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1h26ube/can_yellow_teeth_become_white_again/,Can Yellow Teeth Become White Again?,"If you‚Äôve ever wondered whether yellow teeth can really go back to being white, the answer is YES! But it‚Äôs not always as simple as just brushing more often or using regular whitening toothpaste. Yellowing can happen for lots of reasons‚Äîcoffee, wine, smoking, aging, or even genetics‚Äîand not all stains are created equal. Some are surface stains, while others go deeper into the enamel.

So, how do you bring back that bright, white smile? I found the answer with **Laughland Teeth Whitening**, and here‚Äôs how it worked for me.

# Why Yellow Teeth Are Hard to Whiten

Most over-the-counter products only target surface stains. Whitening toothpaste, for example, is good at removing some discoloration, but it doesn‚Äôt reach the deeper stains that cause yellowing over time. That‚Äôs why many people don‚Äôt see big changes, even after months of trying.

**Laughland Teeth Whitening** tackles this problem differently. It uses a **dentist-formulated gel** that penetrates the enamel to break down tough stains from the inside out. Plus, the LED mouthpiece speeds up the process, making it more effective than other at-home options I‚Äôve tried.

# My Experience with Laughland

I decided to give **Laughland Teeth Whitening** a shot after seeing it recommended in a few places online. The idea of using a dentist-formulated product at home sounded promising, especially since it‚Äôs designed to be **gentle on sensitive teeth** (a big deal for me).

Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. Brush and dry your teeth.
2. Apply the whitening gel to your teeth.
3. Use the LED mouthpiece for 10 minutes.

I followed this routine for 6 days, and by the end of the week, my teeth were noticeably whiter. It didn‚Äôt just cover up the yellow stains‚Äîit actually removed them.

**Curious about Laughland? Learn more** [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# Why Laughland Works

The magic lies in Laughland‚Äôs formula. It uses hydrogen peroxide, the same active ingredient found in professional dental treatments, but it‚Äôs paired with gentle agents like glycerin to prevent sensitivity. Unlike most whitening strips or toothpaste, Laughland is stored in a **temperature-controlled environment**, so the ingredients stay potent until you use them.

The **LED mouthpiece** enhances the gel‚Äôs effectiveness by activating the ingredients, helping them penetrate deeper into the enamel. This combination made a huge difference in removing stubborn yellowing that other products couldn‚Äôt touch.

# What to Expect

By day three, I noticed a slight improvement. By day six, the difference was undeniable‚Äîmy teeth were at least 5-7 shades whiter. The results weren‚Äôt fake or overly bright‚Äîthey looked natural and healthy. Best of all, I didn‚Äôt experience any sensitivity, which has always been an issue for me with other products.

If you‚Äôre wondering if **yellow teeth can become white again**, I‚Äôd say Laughland is proof that they can. It works on both surface stains and deeper discoloration, making it one of the best solutions I‚Äôve tried.

# Who Should Try Laughland?

If your yellow teeth are holding you back from smiling confidently, **Laughland Teeth Whitening** is worth considering. It‚Äôs great for anyone dealing with:

* Coffee, tea, or wine stains
* Yellowing from smoking
* Age-related discoloration
* General dullness from everyday life

With just 10 minutes a day for a week, you can start seeing real results. It‚Äôs simple, effective, and doesn‚Äôt require a dentist appointment.

# Final Thoughts: Can Yellow Teeth Become White Again?

Yes, they can! But not all whitening products are created equal. Laughland‚Äôs combination of professional-grade ingredients, LED technology, and a sensitivity-free formula makes it stand out. It‚Äôs designed to address both surface stains and deeper yellowing, giving you a natural, lasting brightness.

If you‚Äôre ready to bring your smile back to life, I‚Äôd highly recommend giving **Laughland Teeth Whitening** a try. It‚Äôs easy to use, gentle, and the results speak for themselves.

Current Role

Top tier firm where I‚Äôve been since the start and progressed through the ranks.

I‚Äôm on a comfortable salary but who doesn‚Äôt want more in any situation. I‚Äôve got a good year of work behind me and a very strong pipeline of work going into 2025. 


Potential New Role

Smaller form and I would be brought in as a Director to help them build up the team in the specific niche I specialise in.

So I‚Äôm looking after some advice on what I should do or maybe more of what should I ask the company on Monday. A set of questions that would be key would be great!

Of course I‚Äôll have all my contacts but only so much of that is realistically transferable I would imagine. 

I‚Äôm wary that staying in the current role where a promotion isn‚Äôt on the cards as far as I‚Äôm aware could stagnate my career. Do I want to be a lifer as some say? 

In terms of pay, I would be expecting there to be an increase of c.52% plus benefits which I‚Äôm assuming at the moment will be very similar to my current benefits. 


I appreciate anyone‚Äôs thoughts who‚Äôs taken the time to read this and look forward to hopefully having a more in depth think about it over the weekend. Thanks

1h26ga7,https://www.reddit.com/r/reviewdirect/comments/1h26ga7/java_burn_reviews_unbiased_analysis_based_on/,Java Burn Reviews - Unbiased Analysis Based On Science And Real User Feedback,"**Java Burn** is a dietary supplement that claims to work with coffee to enhance metabolism and promote fat burning. If you are looking for **Java Burn Reviews** to learn more about it or make a buying decision, this comprehensive article provides a genuine unbiased analysis of Java Burn. 

There are research evidence that suggest coffee may increase metabolism and mixing coffee with certain ingredients may help burn fat for some people. However, we have not found any independent labotary test of Java Burn's proprietary formula that confirms its efficacy. Despite that, we can still look at other factors to know if it works. Analyzing real unbiased user reviews is a key factor that allowed us to determine how effective the product is.

The real user reviews for Java Burn that we looked at showed mixed feedback of both positive and negative customer reports. While several users claimed to experience beneficial results including reduced appetite, increased energy and dropping a few pounds, we saw a significantly high number of customer reports that said they got unsatisfactory results. Therefore, the product got a rating of less than 50% for effectiveness from us. Below you'll get more details about Java Burn to make an informed buying decision.

**What is Java Burn?**

Java Burn is a dietary supplement which was developed to help coffee drinkers who are trying to lose weight. Java Burn, which works by being added to a cup of coffee, is said to function by combining natural ingredients that increase metabolism and reduce appetite to help fat burning. 

In addition to helping with weight loss, it also claims it can produce several other benefits. In all, the promised benefits include:

* Increased Metabolism
* Appetite Suppression
* Enhanced Energy Levels
* Improved Focus and Alertness
* Support for Overall Health
* Supports Gut Health

**How Does Java Burn Work?**

Adding Java Burn to your cup of coffee is the main requirement for it to work. According to the website, its special proprietary formula which is a combination of natural ingredients were designed to work with coffee to enhance metabolism, decrease cravings, increase energy levels and support overall health.

Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world and it also has weight loss benefits.

There are some research evidence that show the effects of coffee on weight management even though the results are mixed. Studies suggest the benefits of coffee include appetite control and improved metabolism, which could aid weight loss.

Studies have revealed that caffeine may improve your metabolism. This is one reason why caffeine is included as an ingredient in many weight loss supplements. However, the effect of caffeine on metabolism varies among individuals, and the impact on weight loss may not be significant for everyone.

According to the Java Burn website, it harnesses caffeine's ability to increase metabolism by combining coffee with a blend of natural and herbal ingredients. 

Although there are research that backs caffeine's ability to raise metabolic rate as well as the enhanced effects when mixed with certain other ingredients (including some of the ingredients that are part of Java Burn), this does not confirm that Java Burn is effective as claimed. 

The specific proprietary formula that Java Burn's team claims make it work to speedup metabolism has not yet been independently tested for efficacy by any known third-party organization that tests or research supplements. Furthermore, supplement companies in the USA, where Java Burn is made, are not required by the FDA to list the dosage of the individual ingredients in their proprietary formulas aka proprietary blends. This is a disadvantage for consumers, because you do not know the quantity of the key ingredients that you are getting, which might be much less than the required dosage to be effective.

Therefore, one of the only ways to know if a product like Java Burn is effective is by looking at real reviews of people who bought and used the product.

**Java Burn User Reviews** 

Looking for reviews and consumer reports about Java Burn can be a bit frustrating because of the many bias or fake reviews online which can be both positive and negative. 

There are many overly positive reviews promoting the product that could make you feel suspicious of a scam at play. Java Burn is not really a scam, but it is heavily promoted online by marketers who are trying to earn revenue from selling the product. Many of those biased positive reviewers might not be working directly for the company that owns Java Burn, rather they might be working for marketing companies that are under contract to promote the product.

On the other hand, you might also find some viciously negative reviews online blasting the product that might also be bias or fake. Some of these negative reviews might be orchestrated by competitors of the product trying to sabotage a competitor with a campaign of negative reviews. 

Also, negative reviews might come from people who just have strong opposition or distrust toward most or all dietary supplement companies that are claiming to help with weight loss. Therefore, they might also go on a negative reviews campaign to discourage people from buying the product.

Despite all that, we have developed our own methods to easily identify real honest reviews from people who have actually used the product. We can easily separate these genuine reviews, whether it's positive or negative, from the fake or biased ones based on a few key factors such as the platforms they are on, the tone of the reviews and the profiles of the reviewers.

Now, here's a breakdown of the real user reviews of Java Burn that we have looked at. Keep in mind that this breakdown including the ratings are based only on the limited reviews that we have found that were verified as genuine unbiased reviews.:

**Effectiveness: 4/10 Rating** 

The user reviews on Java Burn's effectiveness are mixed. Some users were satisfied with their results and some were not. However, the percentage of people who said the product did not work for them was significantly higher than those who said they got satisfactory results from using it. The positive reviews claimed the supplement helped them control cravings, increase energy and experienced some weight loss. On the other hand, the negative reviews claimed that the product did nothing for them at all. We decided to give Java Burn a 4/10 rating for effectiveness solely because the segmented reviews had a high number of unsatisfied customers. 

**Taste: 8/10 Rating**  

Even though the website claimed that Java Burn would be tasteless when added to coffee, there are a few persons who reported their coffee tasted differently when they added the supplement. However, the majority of the reviewers did not complain about the taste. As a result, we decided to give Java Burn a 8/10 rating for effectiveness.

**Safety: 8/10 Rating** 

We saw a few reviews in which persons reported mild side effects they claimed to experience from using Java Burn. We didn't see users report experiencing serious side effects.

**How to Use Java Burn**

Java Burn is simple to use:

1. Mix one sachet with your morning coffee, 
2. Stir well, 
3. Drink and enjoy.

Other things to note according to the Java Burn website.

* It's designed to be tasteless so that it won't alter the flavor of your coffee. 
* For best results, use it consistently every morning.
* You can add it to any coffee you like

**Java Burn Ingredients** 

The individual ingredients of Java Burn have been demonstrated by credible research to have potential advantages for weight loss and metabolism, even though the product itself hasn't been thoroughly studied in clinical trials. However, to ascertain the precise efficacy of Java Burn's proprietary blend, more research is necessary. 

The key ingredients in Java Burn include:

* Chlorogenic Acid 
* Green Tea Extract 
* Chromium 
* L-carnitine and aL-theanine

**Conclusion** 

The main premise of **Java Burn** is appealing and even backed by science. Adding natural ingredients to coffee to promote weight loss is supported by science-based research and it is a simple and convenient solution. Additionally, clinical research has shown that many of Java Burn‚Äôs core ingredients may have positive effects on metabolism, energy levels, and weight management. However, Java Burn's specific formula of ingredients has not been studied for efficacy. And user reviews shows it did work well for a significant number of users based on our analysis.

For example, I‚Äôve seen many with a 3.0 GPA from a non-target school aspiring to break into investment banking (IB) or private equity (PE). Maybe it's just Toronto, but as someone with that background, I can tell you that nearly every finance graduate is in the same boat. With that profile, breaking into even the Big 4 or Big 10 is extremely difficult‚Äîyou‚Äôd be lucky to land a role at a small accounting firm or as a retail personal banker. I had a coffee chat with this person this week and he was telling me a profile of a candidate who went to a York semi - target for finance and also had FA position at a F500 and begging for a teller role.

On the flip side, some advice shared online feels equally unrealistic. I remember seeing a post from a fellow Toronto graduate struggling to find work with a low GPA. A few people suggested pursuing a Master's in Finance at Rotman or Ivey with a high GMAT score. While I‚Äôm sure the advice was well-intentioned, it seems disconnected from reality. How can someone with poor grades, no job experience, and limited academic references realistically achieve a high GMAT score or secure a spot in such a competitive program?

For years, I‚Äôve struggled with sleep‚Äîfalling asleep, staying asleep, and feeling rested when I wake up. I always thought it was just how I was wired, but recently, I decided to see if caffeine was the culprit. Spoiler alert: it was.

Since quitting coffee, I‚Äôm getting an extra hour of sleep every night‚Äîlike, actual sleep, not just lying in bed tossing and turning. My sleep is also much deeper, with more REM cycles, and I wake up feeling way more refreshed. I think I must be pretty sensitive to caffeine because the change has been life-changing. I‚Äôve finally achieved sleep consistency, and it feels amazing to have a rhythm instead of battling insomnia and fatigue all the time.

I‚Äôve been tracking my sleep for a while, and I used to wake up an average of 15 times per night. After quitting coffee, my sleep interruptions have plummeted, and now I‚Äôm getting these long, uninterrupted stretches of quality sleep that I honestly didn‚Äôt think were possible for me.

The first two days without coffee were the hardest‚Äîsome cravings and a dull headache‚Äîbut after that, it‚Äôs been surprisingly smooth. I‚Äôve replaced my morning coffee ritual with herbal tea, and I honestly don‚Äôt miss the jitters or the energy crashes anymore.

\[...\]

""‚ÄòAll of the myths of mankind are nothing but show business,‚Äô the other man said to me during our initial meeting. ‚ÄòEverything that we supposedly live by and supposedly die by ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs religious scriptures or makeshift slogans ‚Äì all of it is show business. The rise and fall of empires ‚Äì show business. Science, philosophy, all of the disciplines under the sun, and even the sun itself, as well as all those other clumps of matter wobbling about in the blackness up there ‚Äì‚Äô he said to me, pointing out the window beside the coffee-shop booth in which we sat, ‚Äòshow business, show business, show business.‚Äô ‚ÄòAnd what about dreams?‚Äô I asked, thinking I might have hit upon an exception to his dogmatic view, or at least one that he would accept as such. ‚ÄòYou mean the dreams of the sort we are having at this moment or the ones we have when we‚Äôre fortunate enough to sleep?‚Äô

\[...\]

""‚ÄòI make no claims for my writing, nor have any hopes for it as a means for escaping the grip of show business,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòWriting is simply another action I perform on cue. I order this terrible coffee because I‚Äôm in a second-rate coffee shop. I smoke another cigarette because my body tells me it‚Äôs time to do so. Likewise, I write because I‚Äôm prompted to write, nothing more.‚Äô""

\[...\]

‚ÄòMy focus, or center of interest,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòhas always been the wretched show business of my own life ‚Äì an autobiographical wretchedness that is not even first-rate show business but more like a series of sideshows, senseless episodes without continuity or coherence except that which, by virtue of my being the ringmaster of this miserable circus of sideshows, I assign to it in the most bogus and show-businesslike fashion, which of course fails to maintain any genuine effect of continuity or coherence, inevitably so. But this, I‚Äôve found, is the very essence of show business, all of which in fact is no more than sideshow business. The unexpected mutations, the sheer baselessness of beings, the volatility of things . . . By necessity we live in a world, a sideshow world, where everything is ultimately peculiar and ultimately ridiculous.‚Äô

replying to this latter paragraph, the other character asks The question that may be interpreted as at least problematizing, but also possibly fatally deflating the arguably absurdist 'show-business' approach;

""‚ÄòBy what standard?‚Äô I interjected before his words ‚Äì which had arrived at the very heart of the crisis, quandary, and suffocating cul-de-sac of my existence as a writer of fiction ‚Äì veered away. ‚ÄòI said by what standard,‚Äô I repeated, ‚Äòdo you consider everything peculiar and ridiculous?‚Äô After staring at me in a way that suggested he was not only considering my question, but was also evaluating me and my entire world, he replied: ‚ÄòBy the standard of that unnameable, unknowable, and no doubt nonexistent order that is not show business.‚Äô Without speaking another word he slid out of the corner booth, paid his check at the counter cash register, and walked out of the coffee shop. That was the last occasion on which I spoke with this gentleman and fellow writer.""

  
this part engages me really intensely, as i had the exact same question in response to a philosopher's recent work (eric schwitzgebel's 'the weirdness of the world') and to absurdism after a few months of reflection after discovering it a few years ago, leading me to quietism instead of absurdism.

the question bluntly attacks seeking or expecting or anticipating (specific) meaning and/or explanation, and i imagine that the show-business character is actually bewildered & then annulled AF and maybe kills himself (this inference is partly due to the vibes of ligotti's worlds), but nevertheless never returns; either way, his instant exit and future absence can be interpreted as a thoroughgoing quietism after the question fucked his sensemaking activity & instead of that kind of sensemaking/seeking, 

someone else bluntly called bullshit on his energy-intensive, mystified seeking. since FR, if one takes seriously philosophical considerations like the problem of induction, agrippa's trilemma, problem of criterion, known & unknown unknowns, uncertainty, then seeking at all with an expectation, or even worse, an expectation for particular, specific answers, simply becomes kinda not even wrong, like wtf are you even doing? what is this ""standard of that unnameable, unknowable, and no doubt nonexistent order that is not show business""? 

so what explains the presumed not-nonsensical intelligibility of trying to make sense via seeking? if it's always-already an ill-posed, nonsensical glitch of a behavior, then the Really weird, ""ultimately peculiar and ultimately ridiculous"", Really absurd or whatever bombastic existential diagnoses are just nothingburgers. because why would they make sense sans being indexed to The existence of non-absurd, non-weird, non-peculiar, non-ridiculous 'Other Reality'? they wouldn't. 

the show business man got called on his bullshit and the answer he provides is a confessional meta-realization (or confirmation of a lingering, but already existing hunch that he wasn't ready to entertain insofar as it was still only private) that voids him and his show-business schtick, making him switch his strategy to quietism, which is relevantly different from absurdism, as it doesn't grant the assumptions that are required for seeking and for absurd diagnoses to make sense, rendering the seeking always-already not making sense.

I knew salt and sweat, Ray-Bans perched on my head, the grossness of sunscreen gluing my hair to my neck. The memories of sandcastles, and the relentless, yet beautiful scorch of the sun on my skin. 

The heat clashing with the coolness of the sea as I dipped under‚Äîwaiting for that one wave that would toss me into the air, sending me spiraling with the ocean itself before tumbling me back down into the depths.

The surf that eventually carried me back to the shallows and spit me out to where Mom waited with ice cream, always ready to lather me in Factor 50.

Presently, I bit back a hiss when my school bus took yet another sharp turn, jerking my head into the window. 

I was slowly starting to regret my decision to come on this stupid school retreat. 

Why was it snowing?

Leaning my head against the ice-cold glass, I could only stare outside, confusion and slight panic prickling up and down my spine. In the seat in front of me, Sara Lakewood had sneezed again, a violent wet-sounding sneeze, and refused to cover up her damn mouth.

I was used to snow sometimes. Like, maybe a sprinkle, or even just a few inches if we were lucky.

""In OC California today on Wednesday, November 22nd, 2023: sunny, with a high of 75¬∞F and a low of 61¬∞F,"" that's what Alexa had said. ‚ÄúSunny, with cloudier conditions as we move into the afternoon!‚Äù

Pressing my face into the glass, I squinted through spiraling snowflakes that seemed abnormally large, thicker, already obstructing my view. I wouldn't exactly call this cloudy conditions. 

This was freak weather‚Äîthe type I would expect to be on the national news or fear-mongering TikTok pages. 

I tried my phone again; still no signal. I did get one single bar when the bus stopped, and we got stuck in a snowdrift (I still wasn‚Äôt sure how we were still alive‚Äîlet alone why this driver kept going), but it was gone before I could try Mom‚Äôs phone. 

There was barely any visibility outside, and I was having a hard time believing our driver when he assured us that everything was going to be fine.

That slight shudder in his tone wasn't helping. This guy had no idea what the fuck he was talking about. 

The blanket of snow outside shouldn't have freaked me out as much as it did‚Äîbut staring out into what would normally be golden landscapes and endless ocean, I only saw... white. 

With my cheek uncomfortably pressed against the pane, I wrapped my jacket tighter around myself, surprised by my breath dancing in front of me in sharp wisps. 

I shouldn't have been shocked that the school couldn't afford heating on the bus. 

We were a tiny town, and most of our funding went into our sports department. 

However, the least they could do was supply half a dozen kids who were not used to this type of weather‚Äîthis deep-rooted cold sliding into every bone in my body‚Äîwith heat packs. 

I wasn't dressed for arctic conditions. 

That morning, I was pretty sure my wardrobe would only be light sweaters and jeans. 

California weather could be spotty at times, but it was always a guarantee that we were never going to get a literal fucking snow storm. 

Still, if I really strained my ears, I could maybe trick myself into believing the blizzard outside was, in fact, ocean waves crashing against a shore‚Äîwhere I once felt safe.

‚ÄúSummer.‚Äù

The familiar voice barely registered. I ignored it, curling into my seat and willing my body to stop shaking. 

‚ÄúI know you're ignoring me.‚Äù

I kept my focus on the snow piling up on the windows. 

The sheer amount that had fallen in just under an hour was almost impossible. 

I could already sense my classmates' chatter shift from TikTok and Twitch streamers to ""what the fuck is going on outside?""

I was also unlucky enough to get seated in front of Wes Cameron. I had to bite back a hiss when he kicked my seat yet again in an attempt to balance on his seat to get a perfect shot of the storm. 

He was acting like he'd never seen snow before, jabbering to his seat mate, who was currently my other least favorite person on this bus.

‚ÄúSummahhhhhhhh.‚Äù

That annoying voice had turned into a sing-song.

‚ÄúGo awaaaaay,‚Äù I mimicked his taunt. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don't *look* asleep.‚Äù 

I shifted in my seat, trying to get comfortable. ‚ÄúKey word, *trying*.‚Äù

‚ÄúMom says you're not spending the holidays with us.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù I didn't turn around.

‚ÄúThat's not very festive of you, sis.‚Äù 

When I didn't respond, he sighed. ‚ÄúSo, you're going to ruin Christmas for everyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúOuch! Jeez man, you didn't have to do her like that!‚Äù

I wasn't expecting Wes to chime in, poking his head through the gap in my seat. 

He shot me a grin, and I shoved him away, with a finger-poke to the forehead. 

‚ÄúOw!‚Äù

I wasn't sure what made me snap. Wes Cameron trying to squeeze his head through the very small gap in my seat, or the idea that my brother still believed in the magic of fucking Christmas‚Äì when he treated the holidays like spring break. 

He wasn't even conscious for the special day a year prior, passed out on the beach after his holiday party went sideways.

Since Mom was too embarrassed to acknowledge Wes‚Äôs behavior (or admit it to our neighbors), I was the one running to and from our house, with a barf bucket and fresh cans of soda when everyone else was tucking into their Christmas dinners. 

Ah yes, the festive cheer of cleaning up your brother‚Äôs puke!

Dislodging myself from the window, I lifted my head to find the Golden Child himself looming over me, arms crossed, eyebrows raised, mimicking our mother. 

He was wearing a reindeer sweater, which was already a flashing red flag. 

The light up antlers sticking out made me feel nauseous. 

The sweater was too big for him, baggy and hanging off his slim frame‚Äîdefinitely an attempt to get on Mom‚Äôs good side. His bobble hat was a‚Ä¶ choice. Mom was obsessed with holiday-themed clothing.

Fallon, or ""Fall""‚Äîsince, apparently, our parents were comedic geniuses with names‚Äîwas exactly one year older than me. 

And despite his growing list of almost felonies, according to Mom, still the *‚Äùgolden child‚Äù*: while I was the kid she avoided talking about during family gatherings. The socially awkward one who was *just going through a phase*. 

Mom named us after the seasons we were born under.

While I was born in July, summer months, long days, and an increasingly painful pregnancy (thanks for the tmi, Mom), Fallon was born in the fall, under cozy red skies and fallen leaves. 

My brother was the literal fucking Golden Child. 

But I didn't blame her for giving up on me. 

Unlike my brother, who actually had a life, I had ditched surfing and the beach when I found my individuality, choosing to stay at home all day playing Stardew Valley. 

I didn't abandon the outside completely, but I did stop traipsing after my brother and his friends, finding comfort in my own room.

The last time I hung out with my brother, Fallon left to get takeout pizza. I wanted to go with him, but he was crushing on a guy, and apparently, having his little sister third-wheeling was social death. 

I made the mistake of heading back to my brother‚Äôs friend's, who were complaining of my presence. 

They didn't want a fourteen year old kid hanging out with them, and I guess they were too polite to tell my brother.

So, I distanced myself. 

That was until I was forced to acknowledge his existence‚Äîon this stupid field trip. Since his friends were joining us for the entire holiday, Mom insisting on this huge party bringing all our families together, my brother‚Äôs friends were *also* invited. 

Hence, I was planning on spending my holidays elsewhere. My plan was to ignore Fallon‚Äôs existence, and once the field trip was over, jump on a flight. 

However, the universe had other plans. It was pretty hard to ignore him when he was clinging to my seat, our janky bus rocking him side to side. 

Fallon and I were like carbon copies of our mother and father. 

While I had inherited Mom‚Äôs brunette curls and darker complexion, Fallon was a pale redhead. 

You could see the resemblance‚Ä¶ if you squinted. 

It was mostly in our eyes and the shape of our faces. According to someone in class, we had the exact same resting-bitch face.

The same one he was pulling at that moment, eyebrow cocked, lips pricked into a slight smile. I quickly decided that I hated his stupid fucking reindeer sweater, another ploy to get on Mom‚Äôs good side. 

Fallon *loved* family interventions‚Äì especially when he was the one holding them. 

I decided to humor him, trying to ignore our growing audience. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested in playing happy families,‚Äù I spoke through what I hoped was a gritted smile. I could already feel my cheeks growing warm, and it wasn't even a relief. It was *uncomfortable* warm, like sticking your head in an oven. ‚ÄúCan we talk about this later?‚Äù

‚ÄúMom told me to talk to you.‚Äù

It was always ‚ÄúMom says‚Äù with him. Jeez, it was like talking to a toddler. 

‚ÄúI have nothing to say,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt's just two weeks. You can survive without me, Fallon.‚Äù

Fallon folded his arms. ‚ÄúSo, where are you going?‚Äù

‚ÄúFlorida.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI have friends I‚Äôm staying with.‚Äù

I hated the way he smirked, like what I was saying *couldn't* be true. ‚ÄúFriends?‚Äù

‚ÄúI met them on a discord server.‚Äù

He curled his lip‚Äì yet another Mom-ism. ‚ÄúYou're fifteen.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúThey're my *age*, Fallon.‚Äù

When the bus jerked again, this time setting off a cacophony of cries behind us, my brother was oddly calm, tightening his grip on my seat. 

‚ÄúOkay, well,‚Äù his voice wobbled when he was violently thrown backwards, only just managing to keep his balance. ‚ÄúCan you at least let me drive you?‚Äù

‚ÄúFallon Cartwright,‚Äù our driver shouted, tackling the wheel, snow pounding down on the windshield. ‚ÄúPlease sit down!‚Äù

Fallon shot me a look, his eyes widening. I knew exactly what he was thinking. 

Since when did a random bus driver know my brother‚Äôs name? 

I think I was about to question it, amused and maybe a little panicked. Maybe this guy knew our mother? She was a well known name in the town, after all. 

I remember reaching out and grabbing his arm, wrapping my hand around his wrist and tugging him into the seat next to me. 

But in the corner of my eye, the driver fucking exploded. 

I don't mean he burst into meaty chunks, a total gore-fest. 

I mean one minute he was there, frantically trying to brush snow from the windscreen with his bare hand, sticking his head out of the window‚Äì and in a single disorienting moment, *pop!*, and he was gone, exploding into a vivid red mist. 

‚ÄúSummer?‚Äù

Fallon‚Äôs voice was barely scratching the surface of my mind, when I was staring at what almost reminded me of stardust, a crimson tide of red sparkles suspended in the air, lightly coating the driver‚Äôs seat. 

It took me half a second to realize that somehow, this man had just spontaneously combusted‚Äî and it slowly began to dawn on me that *nobody was driving the bus*. The world turned mute. 

Voices were ocean waves slamming into my skull. 

Outside, I could just make out the jagged edge of a cliff we were careening towards, the bus swerving again and sending my classmates into a fresh panic. 

In that moment, I wanted to be the hero, jumping forward to grab the wheel myself and steer us from the cliff face we were teetering on the edge of.

But I could only sit there, paralyzed, dazed. Watching the road get narrower and narrower, it reminded me of going through the tunnel in that old Willy Wonka movie. 

No light, no hope, just darkness slowly enveloping us. 

I never felt the bus tip over the edge. Initially, it was a single sharp jerk that slammed my head into the window. 

I should have felt the lurch, the weightlessness as I was hurled forward and propelled off my feet, and the crushing force of fifty thousand megatons of steeI obliterating my internal organs. 

I remember screams erupting and something wet hitting me in the face, followed by a blinding white light that grew brighter and brighter and brighter. 

When I think back, it felt like living in a movie‚Äì except the movie was ending in one, vivid, fiery explosion so powerful that I was yanked from my body. 

I should have felt my death‚Äîbut whatever death was, it spat me back out. I remember distantly thinking it must not have liked the taste.

I awoke to wails and sobs and my body lodged between two seats. I couldn't feel my legs. I couldn't *feel* anything, only a growing numbing sensation severing my nerve endings. 

I didn't realize my mouth was already open in a silent scream, and I was choking up blood. 

When I managed to open my eyes, and keep them open, something was looming over me, swaying back and forth, back and forth. It was like a pendulum, hypnotizing me and lulling me to sleep, my eyes focusing and blurring, black spots growing big and small, big and small.

‚ÄúSummer!‚Äù

Someone was shaking me, prodding my face. I felt their fingers try to find a pulse in my neck and wrist, but I still couldn't feel my legs. 

I sensed someone's breath in my face, unusually warm, dancing across my cheeks. When they coughed, I assumed fumes‚Äì but I wasn't expecting something warm and wet to coat my face. 

‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù The voice suddenly had an identity, my muddled brain briefly finding clarity. 

‚ÄúSummer, stay with me, all right?‚Äù Wes Cameron knelt in front of me, slapping my face, trying to keep me awake, and when I did open my eyes, I ignored his frantic gaze and blood speckled lips, focusing on the weird swinging object dancing above his head. 

It was too big to be a backpack. Flickering in and out of view, I could see the twisted, mangled skeleton of our bus wrapped around me, crushing my chest in a suffocating embrace. 

‚ÄúI've got you!‚Äù Wes‚Äôs cry was laboured with sobs. I could feel his hands on me, another disorienting wave of dizziness, and then‚Äì ‚ÄúI did it!‚Äù His sharp breath barely grazed my ears before I could *feel*. 

The numbing cold underneath me, blood pooling around the wreckage. Wes didn't hesitate, wrapping me into an awkward hug and violently wrenching me from where I was wedged between what was left of the crumpled seats and window. 

Lying on my back, I saw the carnage from a different angle. I followed the intense red smear. It was so cold, and there was so much pain, coming in sharp pulses rattling my body. 

But I could feel my legs‚Äîthey were intact, folded underneath me. Wes gently pulled me into a sitting position. 

Blood ran from my nose, my mouth, my ears, choking me. But I was alive. 

When my gaze found the swinging shape looming over me, it hit me that I wasn't looking at an object lit up by the bus emergency lights. 

I was staring at what was left of a bright green holiday sweater, illuminated antlers illuminating a reindeer nose that was now soaked in red. 

Delusional, I remembered it hadn't been Rudolph before‚Ä¶ I only saw the torso, and that was enough. 

It didn‚Äôt fully register that it was my brother‚Äôs corpse swinging back and forth until someone‚ÄîWes‚Äîgrabbed my shoulders and forced me to look at him. 

Fallon was dead. 

I wasn't sure what grieving was yet, or even how you were supposed to react to a death.

But in that intimate moment where it was just me and my tumultuous thoughts, that poisonous and selfish part of me could only think of one single word: 

Finally.

And then it well and truly fucking hit me. Fallon was dead. 

Fallon wasn't coming *back*. 

Sound came in and out, like whooshes of air. 

Wes‚Äôs lips were moving, but all I could hear was my frenzied heartbeat. 

Before. 

Whoooosh.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Wes‚Äôs voice was loud and invasive. ‚ÄúLook at me!‚Äù

I didn't look at him. I looked at my brother. Corpse. His corpse.

Somebody was screaming. It wouldn't stop. Distantly, I realized it was me; *I* was screaming.

The noise was horrifying, a shrill screech exploding in my skull. 

‚ÄúSummer, we need to get out of here,‚Äù Wes‚Äôs heavy breaths hit my face. Warm arms were already wrapping around me, pulling me like a doll out of the wreckage and straight into swirling snowflakes. 

It was still snowing. The thought felt muddled and wrong as I sat on my knees, shivering and numb, at a loss for words. 

Around me was a cacophony of my screaming classmates‚Äîsome missing limbs, others barely alive, pleading for death.

Fallon was *still* in there, my thoughts screamed. I didn't see a head. 

I didn't see his full dead body. So, maybe‚Ä¶ I was already on my knees, crawling through blanketed white, before another pair of arms held me back. 

I didn't know her name. Poppy, or Holly, or something like that. 

The girl dropped down in front of me, her eyes wide and unseeing. 

She had been on the track team. 

I vaguely remembered her from our yearbook‚Äîalways at the front of every photo, always smiling, her blonde ponytail swinging and doll-like smile perpetually picture perfect. 

Now, her blonde hair hung in scarlet, tangled rat tails glued to her face.

‚ÄúDid you see it?‚Äù

The girl‚Äôs words caught me off guard, sending me shuffling back. 

The bus driver exploding into red mist. She saw it too. When she came closer, so close her breath prickled my face, I noticed blood seeping from her lips and dribbling down her chin. 

The girl coughed, and I found myself with a face full of bloody mucus. She was ill. 

She wasn't just shivering from the cold, if her feverish skin and bloodshot eyes were any indication. I didn't respond. 

She slowly got to her feet, swaying from side to side as she stumbled away, muttering to herself. 

Holly coughed again, this time covering her mouth, and then stared down at her blood streaked palm, her lip wobbling. Holly was sick, I thought, dizzily.

In a daze, I think I batted her bloody snot from my cheeks. 

 But I don't think I cared. 

I sat there for a long time waiting for Fallon to appear from the wreckage. 

Wes finally dropped down in front of me, grasping my hands. 

I hadn't fully taken in his injuries until that moment, noticing the scary looking gash slicing through his forehead, his thick brown curls hanging in half lidded eyes. He was mostly intact, but each of his words accompanied a violent cough, his chest wheezing. Oh. The thought was like a wave crashing into me. 

Wes was sick too. 

His lips parted and then moved, shaping into what I could only guess was sympathy: I'm so sorry, Summer.

But I couldn't hear him this time. 

Instead, I was wondering why his hands were so *warm*, slick and sweaty, tangled with mine. 

While I was ice cold. 

I found my voice, when I was able to stand, breathing into my hands to stay warm. 

‚ÄúYou don't look so good,‚Äù I told him, and to my surprise, he laughed. 

Then coughed, this time into his hands, and then wiping them on his jacket. 

‚ÄúNeither do you!‚Äù

There were approximately nine survivors, out of twenty kids on our bus. The majority of our class were dead, but that fact had yet to sink in. I was still looking for familiar faces among the shadows of the survivors. 

It quickly became apparent that we were on our own. There was no signal, and when we did manage to find a single bar, 911 was disconnected. 

Kids started to panic, but I just kept telling myself it was because of the weather. 

This snow was unprecedented, not what our town was used to. So, of course our emergency lines would be busy. 

Elizabeth Banks, however, made sure to keep reminding me that the emergency lines were not busy. They were dead. 

Wes took over as our leader, announcing that we weren't that far away from home. 

He was right. Even with the snow, I could still make out where our bus had toppled down a shallow embankment. 

So, gathering as many resources as possible, we started the hike back to town while doing our best to haul the injured on makeshift stretchers. 

I was lucky to be able to walk, driven by pure adrenaline. 

I dreaded seeing my mother, and explaining that Fallon wasn't coming back. Somehow, she would make it all my fault. 

I was already rehearsing the words in my head. 

‚ÄúI'm sorry, Mom. I‚Äôm so sorry I couldn't save him.‚Äù 

There was no right way to tell my mother her son was never coming back. 

And yet again, that selfish part of me didn't want to. 

Why was it my responsibility? Why was I trying to fucking apologize?

Wes‚Äôs initial idea was to hitchhike back to town. But when we got back onto the main road, we realized that was not going to happen. 

Traffic had simply stopped‚Äîcars crashing into each other, jamming the road. 

It's because of the snow, I told myself. 

Wes and two other guys were already checking each car, their faces growing progressively paler. 

We could have blamed it on the treacherous conditions; in fact, we tried to, at first. 

Our town had never experienced snow like this. The type that grounds entire cities to a halt and freezes people in cars.

I was knee deep in snow drifts, wading towards a flipped over ranger, when Dom Hudson voiced my thoughts. ‚ÄúWhere is everyone?‚Äù he spoke up, cutting through that unnerving silence and voicing what none of us wanted to acknowledge. 

I poked my head into each car and found exactly the same thing: the seatbelts were still in place.

Wes was already losing his cool, his voice breaking.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre okay,‚Äù he announced, his tone saying the opposite. ‚ÄúIt's probably because of the storm! I'm sure everyone's‚Ä¶ evacuated.‚Äù

He didn't have to voice his conclusion after checking every car in the vicinity, because we all knew it. 

None of these drivers had left their seats. 

It wasn't until I stuck my head in a fancy Prius, did the magnitude of the situation truly hit me. Just like with our bus driver, I found myself staring at sparkling red mist splattering the steering wheel. 

Wes had an answer, or at least what he thought was one. He was trying to find logic and science, when I was pretty sure we were looking at spontaneous human combustion, on a catastrophic scale. 

I had no idea just how widespread it was until we reached home in the early hours of the morning. I couldn't tell what time. 

It was still snowing, and by then, we were up to our knees in it. The whole town had come to a grinding halt. 

I went straight home in a panic that turned to dread at the sight of our wide open front door. 

Alexa cheerfully greeted me with ‚ÄúWelcome home! The time is 3am on Thursday November 23rd, and the temperature is currently 15¬∞F with a real feel of 7¬∞F.‚Äù 

Water was running upstairs. When I stumbled up to the landing, I stepped straight into suds flooding the bathroom. 

I turned off the faucet, my hands shaking. Mom was running a bath. 

I could see exactly what she was doing in what was left behind. The TV was still switched onto the weather channel, her laptop open on the coffee table, our school‚Äôs website on display. 

Her phone was on the floor, the screen shattered. 

But I saw my name between the cracks. 

Summer ‚ô•Ô∏è 

She tried to call me 54 fucking times. 

Hesitantly, I followed the trail, backtracking into the main hallway where a glass of wine lay shattered on the floor. 

Dropping to my knees, I dragged my fingers across the carpet; the same red smear clung to each fiber. 

I didn‚Äôt want to admit that the scarlet smudge on our hallway carpet was my mother and not her wine‚Äîor that, before she exploded, she had been desperately trying to contact me. 

Going into shock again, I did everything I could to distract myself. 

I checked the refrigerator and pantry, taking note of every item. 

We still had power, so I grabbed my mom‚Äôs phone and tried, once again, to reach an emergency line. 

I washed my face once, twice, three times, four, scrubbing at my face until my skin was raw. I felt like I was caked in him. 

When I pulled out my ponytail, I could feel *him* stuck in my hair and glued to my neck. Fallon was dead.. Mom was dead. 

I spent hours in the shower, hours I don't even remember, sitting with my knees to my chest, trying to imagine if I had only pulled Fallon into his seat sooner. 

He would be with me, trying to calm me down‚Äì the logic in this fucked up mess. The survivor's guilt was eating me alive. 

I was alone. Still though, I found comfort in  my usual bedtime routine, trying to ignore the excited screaming from outside. Younger kids were running in the snow way past their bedtime, happy or hysterical, and still not fully registering that their parents were dead. 

Hours passed by and I was already expecting my mother to come yell at me for not being asleep, or placing warm milk with honey by my bedside. 

But I was alone inside a freezing cold house that was no longer home. 

I started to break apart. I tried and failed to sleep in my room.

It was supposed to be my safe place, but it felt simultaneously too big and like the walls were closing in. I tried Fallon‚Äôs, and I couldn‚Äôt even step over the threshold. 

Everything was still exactly where he‚Äôd left it, like he was coming back. I hadn't been in his room for a while, and he'd revamped it. Fallon‚Äôs personality was lit up in every Marvel movie poster, in his surfboards hanging from the walls. 

His bedroom didn‚Äôt make sense against the backdrop of the storm outside‚Äîheavy, blanketed white clashing with his beaded curtains and multicolored beach towels. 

I could see unfinished college applications on his desk, his laptop still open, frozen on the Minecraft menu screen. Before the field trip, he'd stuck his head through my door. 

‚ÄúYo, do you wanna hang out? I'm setting up Minecraft right now.‚Äù

I ignored him, corking in my headphones. 

I never told him about his friends because I didn't want to fuck up our relationship. 

But I had fucked it up, I pushed him away. 

Closing my brother‚Äôs door, I went back to the dark red stain on the hallway carpet. 

I don't even remember curling up, passing out right there. 

When I woke up, it was daylight, and it was still snowing. 

I was almost snowed in, stepping straight into untouched white.

I was trying to make coffee when there were three singular knocks on the door. 

Wes, still in his pyjamas, and carrying a  bag full of Dunkin Donuts. 

‚ÄúWant one? They're fresh from yesterday, so I'm handing them out.‚Äù he thrust the bag in my face, his mouth full, chocolate dribbling down his chin. 

I noticed significant perspiration  glistening on his forehead, soaking strands of hair glued to his skin. 

His eyes were‚Ä¶ bigger, somehow, the proportions of his face were different. I had to be hallucinating, or maybe concussed. 

But no‚Ä¶ when I blinked rapidly, the boy's face was somehow narrower. 

He was either delirious from his fever, or was slowly splintering apart mentally. When I hesitantly took a rainbow sprinkle donut, his smile started to falter. 

He was trembling, barely able to keep himself upright. 

‚ÄúThere's a meeting in the school auditorium,‚Äù he smiled, handing me a caramel donut too. ‚ÄúIt starts at twelve, so don't be late, all right?‚Äù

I swallowed down donut barf. ‚ÄúMeeting?‚Äù 

He nodded. ‚ÄúYep! There are around two hundred of us. Thirteen to eighteen year olds. Whatever this thing is, it's sparing teenagers.‚Äù He shrugged. 

‚ÄúWell, that's our hypothesis, anyway. Everyone over the age of eighteen, and under the age of thirteen have‚Ä¶‚Äù Wes mimed an explosion with his hands, his eyes growing manic. ‚ÄúBye-bye!‚Äù

His words felt like knives pricking into my back. 

‚ÄúEveryone.‚Äù I managed to spit out. 

‚ÄúYep! *Everyone*!‚Äù

His expression darkened, and I started to see the splinters in his mask, his lips curling. ‚ÄúI found my parents reduced to red sludge, and my baby sister was her own flavour of strawberry shake in her crib.‚Äù 

Wes‚Äôs eyes widened, and he startled me with a choked laugh. 

‚ÄúWait.‚Äù He ran his hands through his hair. ‚ÄúDo you think that's what it is? What if it's aliens turning us into milkshakes?!‚Äù

Wes laughed, holding out his palms‚Äì slick with red‚Äì ‚ÄúSo, that's what this is, right? My little sis. She just turned into fucking Nesquick, man.‚Äù

I wondered if his fever was doing all of the heavy lifting. He was speaking in tongues. 

‚ÄúYou're sick.‚Äù I said, laying my hand on his forehead. 

I had to pull it back, biting down on a hiss. He was burning up. 

Literally. I could barely touch him. 

When I tried brushing soaking strands of hair out his eyes, he wafted my hand away.

‚ÄúI'm not sick,‚Äù Wes mumbled. ‚ÄúIt's from the crash.‚Äù

I took a slow step back, suddenly very aware of him being contagious. ‚ÄúYou're burning up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fiiiiine!‚Äù he rolled his eyes, but then he coughed, which surprised even him, a startled, choked splutter sending him stumbling off balance. I pretended not to see the slew of red seeping down his chin. 

He inclined his head, and I caught something in the slither of his iris. 

Wes had brown eyes. I knew that because I had a silent crush on him all the way through my freshman year, before he started dating Tommy Fields. 

I used to get lost in his eyes, warm coffee grounds with flecks of orange. 

But right then, I couldn't ignore the unmistakable green streak bleeding into his iris. ‚ÄúIt's just a cold, dude.‚Äù he spread out his arms, doing a clumsy twirl.

‚ÄúWhat do you expect? It's snowing! We‚Äôre all gon‚Äô be a lil‚Äô sniffly.‚Äù

To demonstrate, he swiped his nose, pretending not to see the scarlet smear. 

‚ÄúOh fuhhhhck, maybe I'm the one turning into strawberry Nesquick.‚Äù Wes giggled, and his laugh turned into a cough, this time into his hands. He held up the bag of donuts, offering me a two fingered salute. 

‚ÄúI'll be‚Ä¶‚Äù

Another spluttered cough choked his words, his chest heaving. 

‚ÄúFine!‚Äù

I thought Wes was going to collapse when he swayed left and then right, his eyes flashing, before Wes seemed to catch a hold of himself, finding balance. 

He pivoted on his heel and waded back down my driveway, struggling through growing snow drifts. ‚ÄúSeeya at twelve, Summer!‚Äù

I didn't end up going to the meeting after the snow officially locked me inside. 

But thanks to a mass-text sent to our parents' phones (smart), I was informed we were a group of two hundred kids, aged thirteen to eighteen years old‚Äì and we were well and truly alone. 

According to several senior kids, our town was cut off from the rest of the world by the freak weather. I checked the news, and somehow, there was nobody talking about it. The huge snow storm that had hit a small californian town? 

There was nothing. 

Instead, the rest of the world was gearing up for the holidays. 

It almost felt like we had been yeeted from reality itself. 

The Internet was acting weird. I could see what was happening, but I couldn't *post* anything. When I flicked through TV channels, they were always the same ones. 

The mass text also detailed that, starting that afternoon, we had to report to the school auditorium for daily crisis meetings. 

Like every other kid in town, I was numb from losing my family and life itself crumbling around me in a single afternoon‚Äîand yet the underdeveloped part of my brain still wanted to take advantage of zero adult authority. 

Retail therapy it was; I went shopping. 

I forced myself through towering snow-drifts, lugging a wheelbarrow with me, and stocked up on ramen, soda, all the fresh goods that were still there, and of course, candy. The rest of the store had been stripped of every branded soda and candy you could think of‚Äì an army of thirteen year olds leading the charge. 

I was supposed to attend the crisis meeting, but in my head, what was the point? We were all going to die anyway, so what was the point of trying? 

So, I went home, and slept away twelve days. 

I didn't eat or shower, and the fresh food I‚Äôd dumped on my bedroom floor was starting to smell. 

Day 1: I slept for most of it, only getting up to down a bottle of water. 

Day 2: I was barely conscious, only half aware of the lights flickering out. 

Day 3: Loud banging woke me up, and I dragged myself downstairs, opening the door to two boys. I vaguely knew them. Henry Mara and Dalton Atlus. 

The two of them were shivering, and when I peeked past them, the snow had let up slightly. 

‚ÄúFreddie Fawner and his group of freshman freaks took over our house.‚Äù 

Henry held up a bag of apples. I think he was offering them as a gift. ‚ÄúDo you mind if we stay here for a while?‚Äù his hopeful expression and frostbite did me in. 

I nodded and let them in, offering them blankets and letting them have the living room. 

I went back to bed, crashing onto my pillows, the world tilting. 

Day 4: Henry and Dalton were arguing over cereal. I ignored them, and went back to sleep. 

Day 5: My Mom‚Äôs phone woke me up at 5am. **Wes Cameron is dead**, the words headed my notifications. 

**His body was found inside a pharmacy.** 

Something ice cold slipped through me. Wes had a cold, right? 

I sat up in bed, suddenly very conscious of the dryness in my throat. 

I remembered that slither of green creeping into his iris. 

His clammy forehead. 

Day 6: I was woken up by another text. This time, ten fifteen year olds were found dead in their homes. All suspected of the flu. 

Day 7: Henry started coughing downstairs. I jumped out of bed and taped my door shut. I opened my window, and took three tylenol. Another text vibrated my phone: three more fifteen year olds dead. 

Day 8: I couldn't get out of bed, my bones felt like lead. I coughed up something onto my pillow, but I didn't look at it. There were three texts on my phone. 

The first one was alerting us that they were going to stop reporting deaths, the second was that they felt sick, and the third was that they wanted their Mommy. 

Day 9: I was burning, rolling around in sweat-soaked sheets with a mouth full of blood. Henry had stopped coughing. 

I could hear the boys moving around. 

I hallucinated my brother standing over me with abnormally pointy ears, a grin splitting his mouth wide. 

I felt his ice cold fingers tip-toe across my clammy forehead, and when I looked at him, blinking rapidly, I could have sworn his eyes were bigger. 

Bulgier, almost cartoon-like. 

But he was beautiful. Grotesquely beautiful. 

Wes climbed through my window, followed by the girl from the crash.

Holly.

Day 10, I think I died, my body no longer mine. 

Day 11: I was still dead, on my bedroom floor, choking up wet, slithering red chunks. I couldn't speak or breathe, or eat, my body was scorching, my screams strangling through my lips after bypassing my cooked vocal chords. 

Day 12: 

I could move again. Not well, but well enough to stand. My body felt strange, too light and yet also heavy, like I was both floating, and dragging myself. 

Calling out for the boys, I headed downstairs, covering my mouth with a soiled pair of pajama pants, and stepping straight into sticky red pooling across Mom‚Äôs prized rug. 

Henry lay on his back, choking on bubbling scarlet dribbling down his chin. 

Dalton was vomiting in the sink, his trembling body convulsing‚Äîlumps of fleshy red splattered on the floor.

Henry‚Äôs face looked sharper, paler, his eyes sunken, ears *pointier*. 

I found myself choking down hysterical giggles that were choking me. Before the thought could graze my mind, my brain was suddenly on fire. I dropped to my knees, coughing, red filling my mouth. 

My limbs contorted, my head swimming. The sickly stench of *peppermint* seeping into my nose. Bells rang loud and invasive in my ears.

A voice echoed through my skull: 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, children. The transformation is painful, but only if your body rejects it. Right now, your human tissue is converting to *elf* tissue. I know it hurts! But I lost quite a lot of my workforce this year! So, I have no choice! The show must go on!‚Äù he boomed. 

‚ÄúHuman children aren't quite ideal, but they should do the job. I need at least 500 of you to compete with this year's demand.‚Äù

He laughed, and Henry collapsed, his head smacking on the edge of the sink. 

**‚ÄúI'm sure your parents will become fine meat-scraps for my reindeer!‚Äù**

I screamed, my body contorting, his words forcing me onto my side. 

I choked up what I was guessing was my internal organs. 

All I could think about was my brother. 

Did this *thing* work on the dead too? 

Wes. 

Was he a failure, or was dying just the start? 

When my body lurched onto its side, and I choked up something wet and slimy, the floorboards creaked behind me. 

Henry and Dalton stood. They didn't speak. 

They just walked out of the door, straight into a blizzard, stardust dripping from them.

I waited for my body to twist, just like theirs. 

But I kept bleeding, all over myself, sticking my hair to my neck. 

My eyes flickered, Santa's laugh bouncing in my skull.

I waited to die, or at least become an elf. 

But I didn't. 

I still felt light and wrong, and when I looked in the mirror, my face was twisted out of shape, my ears too pointy, too *sharp*. 

When I was well enough, I left my house, finding a wasteland of snow and bodies, kids who rejected the transformation. 

Santa had taken the others, and left me. 

When the snow did start to melt, I had people in masks banging on my door. I let them throw me in an unmarked van and take me out of town. 

I spent the next several months being experimented on. 

The man who tested me said the experts has known about Santa's existence for a while. 

But they hadn't seen what they call a *conversion* on this scale. 

Dr Mycroft, the man who prodded and poked me every day, told me the conversion is the process of human cells and tissue being forcibly transformed. 

The only way to stop it is to reject the idea of Santa Clause. 

So, that's what I want all of you to do. Right now. 

Before this thing spreads globally, please. 

Stop believing in my friends, who forcibly became elves against their will. 

Wes, Holly, Dom, Henry and Dalton, all the kids he took away. 

Stop believing in this psychopath who murdered my parents. 

Stop. 

Believing. 

In.

* Drought and high temperatures, combined with a global reliance on supplies from relatively few regions or countries, are the key drivers behind this year‚Äôs top-performing commodities.
* While the cocoa surge earlier this year garnered significant attention, strong gains have also been seen in orange juice and now also coffee which hit a 47 year on Wednesday
* A challenging growing season in Vietnam, the top producer of Robusta beans, has now moved to Brazil where adverse weather has raised serious concerns about the 2025 Arabica crop

Drought and high temperatures, combined with a global reliance on supplies from relatively few regions or countries, are the key drivers behind this year‚Äôs top-performing commodities. While the cocoa surge earlier this year garnered significant attention, strong gains have also been seen in orange juice and, more recently, coffee.

Cocoa prices have soared 240% this year due to tightening supplies caused by lower production in West Africa. Similarly, orange juice futures in New York have risen 88%, supported by declining production amid weather concerns in Florida and Brazil, the latter being the world‚Äôs top exporter. To this list, we can now add coffee, which has experienced a two-fold rally in recent months. In September, robusta coffee, known for its strong, bitter flavour, reached a record high on the ICE-LIFFE futures exchange in London, and currently trades up 86% on the year. This followed a challenging growing season in Vietnam, the top producer, where dryness during the growing period was followed by heavy rains at harvest time.

[Arabica and Robusta first month futures contracts](https://preview.redd.it/jc38roxemp3e1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ada0e5e18b73bfd972b47a6121b52549fb90628)

This week, arabica coffee futures traded in New York and prized for its smoother taste and used in espressos and high-quality products, surged to a 47-year high and is currently up 72% year-to-date. Similar to orange juice, concerns over the 2025 crop in Brazil are the main driver. The country experienced its worst drought in 70 years during August and September, followed by heavy rains in October, raising fears that the flowering crop could fail. Back in June, the USDA forecasted 2024/25 coffee production at 69.9 million (60 kg) bags, comprising 48.2 million bags of arabica and 21.7 million of robusta. However, their latest update this month reduced those figures to 45.4 million and 21 million bags, respectively, with further downgrades expected when Brazil‚Äôs National Supply Company (CONAB) releases its next update.

Coffee is one of the world‚Äôs most traded commodities and is often considered the second-most traded by volume, after crude oil. It is a staple beverage for billions of people globally, with demand further boosted in recent years by growing consumption in China. However, production has struggled to meet this rising demand. Like cocoa, coffee is grown in a relatively narrow tropical band, with key producers including Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, and Ethiopia. This concentration makes it particularly vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, especially in Brazil and Vietnam, which together account for approximately 56% of global production.

The rally this week has been driven by several factors, the most important being the risk to supply triggering panic buying from commercial buyers worried about shortages, while front loading of sales to the US ahead of potential tariffs may also play a part. Finally, the looming introduction of the European Union‚Äôs contentious deforestation regulation (EUDR) is injecting an additional layer of complexity into the market. The lack of clarity around the official start date for these rules and their eventual impact on supply routes to Europe has left traders and importers grappling with unanswered question.

As of late (the last 6 years) my sister had been getting horrible anxiety attacks. To the point where she quit her job and collects disability. Her husband had to get an at home job because she doesn‚Äôt allow him to leave the house without her. This means less income too, and they have 3 kids. 

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where we aren‚Äôt allowed to visit here and there, it has to be planned a month in advanced (which isn‚Äôt super odd, I don‚Äôt like company much either) and you aren‚Äôt allowed to have your phone out in front of her or her kids because she‚Äôs scared we are going to record them. 

Lately she‚Äôs been declining offers to come to the park with us/her friends. No more coffee dates, etc. 

The last straw for me today is how she handled our family Thanksgiving gathering. 

Side note - she decided to get into witchcraft which I thought was really cool. I love tarot cards and things of that nature so we had some things in common, although she‚Äôs more into it than I am. 

Anyways, lately she‚Äôs been bashing our grandmother and aunties behind their back because they go to church every Sunday, and how God isn‚Äôt real so grandma shouldn‚Äôt be going. (My sister and I both have spiritual beliefs but our family is more on the catholic side) 
Despite all this though I‚Äôve never ever heard of our family members complaining about my sister to her face or behind her back and thought it was weird that she was insulting their beliefs. In fact our family has given her crystals and cards and things because they know she‚Äôs into spiritually/witchcraft. 

Well the last straw was me finalizing plans to host family Thanksgiving. I got the number of people planning to attend when I noticed she removed herself from our Thanksgiving text chain. I texted her and asked what was up and she said she was so insulted that we invited her to a catholic dinner and we should know she doesn‚Äôt celebrate thanksgiving. I don‚Äôt go to church though and neither does our parents so honestly it was just going to be a dinner. (I didn‚Äôt even think thanksgiving was religious???)

She said her anxiety is so bad and she doesn‚Äôt plan on ever coming to a family event again. 

I don‚Äôt know. I just don‚Äôt get it. We tried to be accommodating, she‚Äôs been to doctors, she‚Äôs on medication, and her husband goes along with whatever she needs so he will bd staying home with her and we can‚Äôt see our nieces.

My psychologist is concluding the therapy because of how well I've improved.,"It's been five grueling, torturous years. Five years not being able to hold down a job, because I couldn't focus on the work I was supposed to do. Five years of my social life falling to pieces because my friends couldn't deal with my constant anger and paranoia. Five years of watching my life collapse in on itself, piece by piece. Five years of police occasionally showing up to my door because the neighbors heard me scream. Five years of wishing I hadn't survived it when it happened--- death is more merciful than this bullshit.

But I did all the things they told me to do. I went to the police. I went to the doctor. I went to a therapist, and 5 more therapists who couldn't figure out my problem. A few psychiatrists too. A couple of psych wards and psychiatric institutions. I tried all the pills they gave me. Until I found the combo that worked and the therapy that was right for me.

And now I'm almost back to feeling normal again. Well, not quite the same as before (that person is gone forever) but this new version of me is quite alright. I can feel a peace now, a calm, a sense of normalcy that seemed so out of reach when I was at my worst. I can sit outside and drink a coffee, I can go shopping, I can drive my car, while barely even thinking about what happened at all! And when I do think about it, it doesn't threaten me the way it used to. When I watch the movie of what happened in my mind, the monster doesn't crawl out of the screen and eat me anymore. It's merely a normal movie now. I can change the channel and watch something I actually want to watch.",5,1732827979.0,ptsd,1,1.0,False

I am a 27F. I am currently in Canada on a work permit that will expire in april and my situation just kinda got tricky. 
My whole life my indian orthodox family has ensured I keep failing. First they stopped me from pursuing a degree of my choice. I however still got a job in that market and can today say that I am proudly making a mark in my field (Media and television)

I moved to canada last year as my parents desperately wanted me to move abroad and make it big like my millionaire sibling who is an engineer in the USA. 

 With my salary, my education loan and immigration expenses, i am unable to sustain myself. I tried asking my sister and my dad for money but they both turned their back on me as they believe I made the wrong choice w.r.t. my life. The only way they will help me is if I move back to India.

This broke my heart, because what kind of a family would support you if you agree to fail. I still have time in Canada, i have applied for a PR, i work at a very successful media agency however the economy here is tough. I don‚Äôt shop or do any unnecessary expenses. I think 10 times before buying even a small cup of coffee. 

This morning I woke up and decided I have had enough. I have no other option but to make more money, and build myself up. I already have around 8000$ in savings from my early 20s. But they are stuck in a mutual fund in India that I cannot touch for another 2 years. 

Here‚Äôs the thing, Canada is new to me, and I have nothing to lose so here I am asking somebody to take me under their wing. If anybody can teach me the ropes or even just give suggestions I‚Äôd be very grateful. I think I want to invest in stocks. I need guidance. 
I am willing to also maybe give you a cut if I make any profits. But not a high % maybe 10% or so.

Please help me out.

Looking back the only thing I changed was I started drinking coffee. I honestly didn't think it had anything to do with it because I drank one coffee here and there before and it didn't effect the kratom. But I think maybe something in my physiology changed after a longer period of consuming coffee, because this week I decided to quit caffeine, and only now like 4 days after quitting is the kratom suddenly working again....weird

First, let me say that I have four roommates, but one of them is the most obnoxious in my opinion. She must be the constant center of attention. She plays loud music, shaved her head, drives a giant  truck and dresses really funky which is all fine but if you don‚Äôt comment on any of these obvious things that make her different, she will be really weird and annoying until you are forced to pay attention to her. She leaves dishes piled high in the sink and snaps at anyone who cleans it for her or confronts her on it. She leaves dead flowers in vases for weeks until the stems mold. She leaves moldy food in the fridge, and then she yelled at me for throwing it away, saying she doesn‚Äôt believe in food waste and that she eats around the mold. She leaves half empty cups of coffee everywhere and yells at you If you pour it out, she leaves the sink running, walks away for 10 minutes and comes back just to turn the sink off and then walk away again I believe she does this just to get a reaction. 
And when she is called out on anything, she retaliates in very petty ways like purposely leaving the back door unlocked, blaring, her music even louder, removing the toilet paper from the bathroom etc. 

So today as its thanksgiving my mom was going to come by and we were going tohave a small little  dinner with takeout. I woke up this morning to loud banging in the kitchen and music blasting. It turns out she has invited her entire family over to cook and have Thanksgiving here. She never mentioned this to anyone, nor did she offer anyone food or invite any of the roommates to join her family not that I would want any of her moldy food but still it‚Äôs just very rude.

I recently got blackout curtains, a memory foam mattress topper, and a weighted blanket. But the problem is that I'm a college student with classes that usually start after 12 (the ones before aren't important). So, because of my newfound sleeping setup, I cannot wake up no matter what before 11 am. I try to go to bed at around 1-2 am and usually always get 8+ hours of sleep. I drink rarely and don't drink coffee. Once I force myself out of bed, I become wide awake. My problem is that without having any responsibilities in the morning, I can't wake up, as I love my comfy setup too much.¬†Anyone else have this problem where they just love their bed wayy too much?

Last year around this time, I was already 1 full bottle of wine into the day. Use a little to baste the turkey and drank the rest while I was cooking... and probably headed to the overpriced liquor store open to grab a magnum (1.5L) bottle and I'd drink all of that before the evening too.

I'd struggle to make it through cooking everything, carve the turkey and then probably go pass out, without eating the meal I spent all day cooking. 

We were invited to spend the day with family this year, but they all binge drink on the holidays and I just don't feel like being around that. 

So, this year, I've drank a pot of coffee by now. The turkey is smelling great and because I'm cooking a huge meal and only have my husband and son here to eat it, we are going to make extra plates and give them out to people in my community that want a homecooked meal and don't have anywhere to go or the means to make it themselves. I've got 7 people coming by to pick up to go meals when its all done in a few hours. 

Feels like a much better way to spend the holiday.. not around alcohol and sharing the meal with others who will appreciate it. 

Wishing you all a wonderful, sober Thanksgiving!

I wanted to share something that's genuinely made a huge difference for me lately. For what feels like forever, I've been dealing with constant bloating (the kind where your clothes suddenly don't fit), those brutal afternoon energy crashes, and brain fog that made even simple tasks feel impossible.

At first, I just blamed it on the usual suspects - stress, busy schedule, not eating perfectly, whatever. But it kept happening, and I started thinking there might be something bigger going on.

That's when I stumbled across research about the gut-brain axis during one of my late-night health anxiety scrolling sessions (we've all been there, right?). Mind = blown. Your gut and brain are literally in constant communication, and your gut health affects everything from your mood to your focus to your energy levels. Who knew?

I decided to dive deeper into gut health research and started implementing some changes. It's been about a month, and honestly? The difference is wild:

* That ""6-months-pregnant"" bloating? Almost completely gone
* Those 2PM energy crashes where I needed 3 coffees just to function? Way less frequent
* The brain fog that made me feel like I was thinking through mud? Finally lifting

Here's the thing - I'm not doing anything extreme. Started with some basic lifestyle changes:

LIFESTYLE:

* Eating slowly and mindfully (actually chewing food properly now)
* No food 3 hours before bed
* 15-min walks after meals
* Basic stress management (10-min meditation)

DIET CHANGES:

* Added fermented foods (kimchi, Greek yogurt, kefir)
* More fiber-rich foods (chia seeds, flax, leafy greens)
* Cut back on processed foods and sugar
* Staying hydrated (tracking water intake)

Here's what made the biggest difference (combo of supplements):

**1. Probiotic + digestive enzymes**¬†for improved digestion.

**5. Vitamin complex -**¬†this reduced inflammation and helped balance my gut microbiota. (Just finished, so can't find the bottle, soooorrry!)

**P.S.**¬†Not to get, what really set the stage for these changes was starting with a simple 14-day detox. It acted as a gentle reset for my gut, helping to reduce bloating, improve digestion, and make me feel lighter overall. During those two weeks, I made some big changes to my diet as well. Before, I was eating a lot of processed foods, sugary snacks, and honestly, meals that were more about convenience than nutrition.

With the detox, I focused on eating cleaner - things like leafy greens, chia seeds, and flax, along with fermented foods like kimchi and yogurt. I cut out processed foods and drastically reduced sugar, which was a huge shift for me. It wasn‚Äôt easy at first, but by the end of the two weeks, I noticed a huge difference in how I felt. It really seemed like my body was finally ready to absorb all the good stuff I was introducing, and it motivated me to stick to healthier habits moving forward.

On top of these changes, I‚Äôve been using this one too as part of my routine - it‚Äôs a gentle gut cleanse 14 day complex.

**Plus**¬†added in anti-inflammatory foods (turmeric, ginger) and gut-soothing teas (chamomile, peppermint). The supplements combined with better eating habits really seemed to make everything click.

It's not just about digestion - my energy is better, mood is more stable, and I actually feel clear-headed again. It's wild how connected everything is.

I keep seeing posts about similar symptoms, so I'm curious - has anyone else looked into the gut-brain connection? What's worked for you?

Let's share experiences - honestly feels like this might be the missing piece for a lot of us who've been feeling ""off"" without knowing why.

1h252vc,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1h252vc/my_hemorrhoid_journey_from_diagnosis_to_surgery/,"My Hemorrhoid Journey: From Diagnosis to Surgery
","# Background

* **2019:** First noticed blood in my stool.
* **2022:** The issue worsened. My underwear often had yellow or blood marks, and irritation was becoming a regular problem. Diagnosed with Grade II hemorrhoids. The doctor prescribed laxatives, Hemagel, and Hemagel Procto suppositories, but I only used them for two weeks and ignored the problem after it seemed to improve. I convinced myself I could manage with diet changes, but I didn‚Äôt stick to it.

# April 2024: The Turning Point

I began experiencing severe colon issues: acid reflux, heartburn, bloating, and a constant urge to empty my bowels‚Äîup to 8 times a day. Often, I strained, and only blood would come out, sometimes in alarming amounts.  
A CT scan ruled out major issues except for kidney stones, but a colonoscopy revealed internal hemorrhoids as the cause of the bleeding. The gastroenterologist advised surgery, but I delayed. Fortunately, the colon symptoms resolved after a couple of months, but the hemorrhoids remained a problem.

# July 2024: A Warning Sign

I saw a surgeon who confirmed internal hemorrhoids. After using Daflon, Hemagel, and suppositories, the bleeding stopped. But soon after, I felt unusually weak‚Äîcarrying my 2-year-old son felt like running a marathon.  
At the ER, my hemoglobin was alarmingly low at 6. A blood transfusion brought it up to 8. The doctor urged me to consider surgery, but with the bleeding stopped and my diet improved, I decided to delay again.

# November 2024: No More Delays

Bleeding returned after stopping the medication, and my iron dropped to 4.7. This time, I knew surgery was unavoidable.

# Contributing Habits

* Spending too much time in the bathroom (25‚Äì40 minutes per session).
* Straining during bowel movements.
* Dehydration and low fiber intake leading to hard stools.
* Constipation.

All of those are related, and the solution was to get a regular and healthy bowel movement. I knew this, and I was planning on fixing it, but I never did.

# Pre-Surgery Diagnosis

Four internal hemorrhoids, Grade 3.

# Consulting Surgeons

* **Doctor 1:** Suggested a combination of Ligasure‚Ñ¢ hemorrhoidectomy¬†and Rubber-band Ligation.
* **Doctor 2:** Recommended THD (Transanal Hemorrhoidal Dearterialization).
* **Doctor 3:** Preferred LHP (Laser hemorrhoidoplasty).

I chose the third doctor for his confidence in laser surgery. However, he explained that during the operation, he would choose the most effective method based on my condition.

I discussed why he chose Laser instead of THD. I told him that some doctors online mentioned that THD is less painful than laser. So, here‚Äôs his take:

*THD vs Laser:*

1. THD, the device may miss secondary arteries, leading to failure. THD uses Doppler ultrasound to identify hemorrhoidal arteries, but if a secondary artery is not detected, it could contribute to incomplete treatment.
2. THD often involves both artery ligation and lifting the prolapsed hemorrhoidal tissue, and the latter step could be painful if the surgeon doesn‚Äôt do it the right way and touches the area near the anus while stitching.

So, my conclusion was that for THD surgery to be a success and less painful, you need a really skilled surgeon to do it, who has a high success rate with it. My doctor wasn't rooting for it, although he has done the procedure before.

I told him that I‚Äôve been suffering for a few years, and that I am not able to choose the best treatment method. He said look, Laser is perfectly fine, and don‚Äôt worry about it coming back, as I have a high success rate with it, and none of my patients complained about it. Then he paused and said look, I‚Äôll decide what is the best way during the operation, how about that? I said I‚Äôm tired of thinking so I‚Äôll trust you on this.

# Surgery Day: November 17, 2024

* ¬†I was asked if I want a general or spinal anesthesia. I chose the latter. The doctor injected a needle, it did hurt a bit at the moment but seconds later I don‚Äôt feel anything down there.¬†
* Few minutes later, the doctor came to me and told me that the hemorrhoid is large and the laser won‚Äôt be an option. He said I‚Äôll remove it with a Ligasure procedure. I said, not THD? He said no. I said fine, let‚Äôs do it. He cut the 4 internal hemorrhoids with ligasure. I was hoping he would remove the small ones with a laser, but I think when I told him that I have been suffering, and I don‚Äôt want to deal with them again in the future, we chose this direction.
* Sometime later he came to me and said, look, this is the one causing the bleeding. He showed me a small red ball that he cut from inside me.¬†
* The procedure finished at 5 PM, and it took one hour.
* Around 10 PM, the anesthesia was wearing off, and I started feeling a severe pain. I called the nurse, and they said we gave you a painkiller already, I told her give me a stronger one or put me to sleep, the pain was 10/10. The doctor in the shift came in and prescribed a stronger pain killer, it was injected directly in my shoulder. He asked me to use a sitz path that they put in the bathroom filled with a solution that is red in color (looks like blood). I sat there for a few minutes and went to bed. The pain started to cool off immediately after the strong pain killer was given. I couldn‚Äôt pee since the penis is still numb but I feel pain in the bladder because it is filled so the doctor said I‚Äôll install a catheter and we will remove it in the morning. I couldn‚Äôt sleep well that night, but the pain was bearable after the strong pain killer was given.

# Post-Surgery Tips

1. **Diet for soft stools:** 5 prunes + 1 kiwi + apple juice daily.
2. **Bidet with warm/hot water:** Makes bowel movements easier.
3. **Warm baths:** Immediate relief after bowel movements. Bathtub is a must.
4. **Leakage management:** Use diapers or men‚Äôs pads.

# Prescribed Medication

* **Solpadeine (Codeine):** 3 times daily for 7 days (for pain relief).
* **DividO (Diclofenac Sodium):** 2 times daily for 7 days (for pain and inflammation).
* **Daflon (Diosmin and Hesperidin):** 3 times daily for 30 days (to strengthen blood vessels and reduce swelling).
* **Movicol Sachet (Polyethylene Glycol, Electrolytes):** 3 times daily for 7 days (to ensure soft stools and prevent straining).
* **Hemagel:** 3 times daily for 15 days (to aid healing and reduce irritation).

**Key Lessons Learned**

Ignoring symptoms only makes them worse. Had I addressed my habits and followed through with doctor visits earlier, I could have avoided years of discomfort and complications. Surgery, though daunting, was necessary to regain control of my life.

**Daily updates:**

**November 18, 2024 (Day 1):**

* The catheter got removed, and I could pee on my own without a problem.
* They gave me a clear liquid breakfast.
* The pain was 4/10 since the painkillers are working. Once they start wearing off, I feel more pain but they inject the next dose so I start feeling better.
* The doctor came in and said we could discharge you and I said, let me stay one more day.

**November 19, 2024 (Day 2):**

* Today I felt good, and got discharged.
* The gave me the following medications: Solpadeine (codeine) 3 times for 7 days, DividO (Diclofenac sodium) 2 times for 7 days, Daflon 3 times for 30 days, Movicol Sachet (Polyethyline glycol, electrolytes) 3 times for 15 days, Hemagel 3 times for 7 days.
* I asked the doctor if I should follow a clear liquid diet, and he was against it. He said you should eat well, and we‚Äôre already giving you a laxative.
* I drove back home (40 minutes drive), and I was sitting on my left leg, as I wasn‚Äôt comfortable sitting ( I should have bought a Donut Pillow).
* I layed down the whole day on my bed.
* The only painful thing was passing gas, and I was passing frequently so this caused discomfort.

**November 20, 2024 (Day 3):**

* I was feeling fine, so I took the kids to the nearby park for a walk.
* I am taking the meds, eating normal meals. I tried to avoid large portions, oily food, and red meat.

**November 21, 2024 (Day 4):**

* Still no BM, and painful gas.
* There was no noticeable pain, as I was laying down most of the time.

**November 22, 2024 (Day 5):**

* This was the worst day so far.
* I woke up, and felt the urge to have my first BM post surgery. I had to push two times to get small normal pieces, but the third one, I got a mountain of mud. It was easy to pass it thanks to the laxatives I was taking, and the process took a couple of minutes. However, the pain went straight to 10/10 and I started whining out loud to ease my pain.
* I filled the bathtub with warm/hot water for one hour, and I got a bit of relief. As soon as I left the bathtub, the pain went back to 10 immediately.¬†
* I layed down in my bed whining for 1 hour until I started getting relief. I felt moisture down there so I wiped it with a tissue and saw blood.
* The moment I moved, the pain started again with a burning sensation so I went back to bed and stayed there until I slept.
* I messaged the doctor, and he said that the blood is normal, and to ease the pain, he prescribed Prila cream (Lidocaine) and said to use it half an hour before passing stool.

**November 23, 2024 (Day 6):**

* I woke up feeling much better, no pain, and everything is fine. I can still feel there‚Äôs a wound there when walking but while setting all is good.
* I stayed laying down on the couch the whole day, as with walking I feel a bit uncomfortable.
* I passed gas and a bit of stool in the toilet (but it was tiny so I won‚Äôt count it as the second BM). It wasn‚Äôt painful.
* I used only one of 3 doses for the Codeine pain killer and decided this will be the last one.
* Underwear became constantly dirty with leakage. I bought adult diapers. I choose them over men's pads because I like to keep the area breathing, so I bought large adult diapers and wear shorts on top of them so nothing is sticking up there.

**November 24, 2024 (Day 7):**

* I woke up and ate my breakfast. I decided to drink milk and coffee for the first time post surgery (this drink used to make me have an instant BM if I drank it on an empty stomach).
* 20 minutes later and I had my second BM post surgery. It was tolerable, and there was minimal pain at it. However, once I stood up, the pain was like 4/10 so immediately I filled the bathtub with hot water and soaked in. Instant relief and the pain was 0/10. I stayed there for 1 hour.
* Once I left the bathtub and started walking, the pain was minimal, like 1/10, but while laying down I am pain free.
* I didn't need pain killers nor the Lidocaine cream I bought. I fel like this is the turning point, and that everything is great.
* Afternoon, after lunch, I had the 2nd BM for the day and the 3rd overall. The pain was 6/10 so I jumped directly in the hot bathtub and it cooled everything down instantly.
* In the evening, I had the 3rd BM for the day. The pain was 4/10 so the same drill: half an hour in the hot water then laying down on the couch, as I feel the sourness when I walk directly after.
* One hour later goes to the 4th BM for the day. It was harder and the pain shooting to 8/10 so the same thing, the hot bathtub to the rescue.
* I believe the pain killer was causing constipation since it is one of its side effects. Probably I should stop the laxative. I will check with my doctor. Or maybe it was the coffee?¬†
* This day started fine but in the second half I was feeling like I had diarrhea.
* The area down there is swallowing and the pain is 4/10 when I move. Laying down in bed to sleep and hopefully it will be healed in the morning.

**November 25, 2024 (Day 8):**

* I visited my doctor for a follow-up. I told him I had Diarrhea the previous day, and he said stop using the laxative and fix your diet to prevent constipation. He emphasized on the importance of soaking in hot water 4 times per day, and using the provided gel to expedite the healing. I asked if I can continue using the painkiller and he said use Divido as per the need, and stop using Solpadeine.¬†
* Later that day, I had diarrhea, so I felt unrest in my stomach all day. The loop was: BM 2m ‚Üí Bathtub 0.5h ‚Üí Lay down 0.5h ‚Üí BM and that kept going for 4 times. The pain was 3 in the first one, and kept escalating to be 10 in the last one. I had to use both painkillers.
* I slept while feeling the sourness.

**November 26, 2024 (Day 9):**

* I woke up, feeling unrest in my stomach, and immediately I made a BM, then I soaked in the bathtub for 40m to get relief. The pain was 4/10.
* I felt sore so I took the pain killers, and layed down on the couch for the rest of the day. I didn‚Äôt feel anything while laying but I felt a bit of soreness when walking.
* I ate very light, to avoid having diarrhea, or gas, and I felt much more comfortable today overall.¬†

**November 27, 2024 (Day 10):**

* I woke up¬† with no pain so I didn't take pain killers.
* I felt good enough to go out and take the kid for a half an hour walk nearby home.
* At noon I had a BM, and the pain was 6/10 and the bathtub made it 0. As soon as I walked out of the bathtub, the pain was 4/10. I layed down and the pain is 2/10 and sometimes it goes to 3/10. Trying to stop using the painkillers completely so let's see how long it takes to feel ok after the BM.
* I layed down on the bed the whole day, the moment I walked I felt the sourness so I jumped in the bathtub for half an hour.
* It was tolerable without pain killers for the whole day given I was laying down for the most time. Looking for the day where BMs won't take all day to feel fine again before the next one comes.

**November 28, 2024 (Day 11):**

* I woke up feeling fine, 1/10 pain when walking.
* I had my BM in the morning, and the pain was 7/10. I jumped in the bathtub for relief but as soon as I got out it was 7/10 again. I figured I should use the pain killer so I used it again.
* One hour later, still feeling pain and needing the toilet, it was an incomplete evacuation. This BM was much more painful. It was 9/10 but luckily not all the time, just for a few seconds then instant relief in the bathtub. I still moaned for a couple of minutes.
* I layed down in bed for 3 hours, and started to feel better, so I ate lunch. Immediately after lunch, I felt a pain in my stomach, went to the toilet and there was a BM. It came in 4 batches (separated by seconds to minute - I used to stand to help it flow), and it was sizable. I soaked in the hot water, and the 5th batch came after a few minutes. It was liquid and yellowish, not like the previous one. It made me wonder if the painkiller gave the diarrhea-like form since it's one of its side effects. I continued soaking for half an hour.
* I layed down in bed for the remainder of the day. There‚Äôs still soreness when walking.",4,1732826014.0,hemorrhoid,0,0.84,False

A few months back we (friend + me) ran into my therapist of 2 years at this gym. It‚Äôs tricky because people join this gym for the community aspect where people hang out and talk at the coffee shop after class but therapist and me discussed the boundaries and made a solid plan. Recently my therapist asked me if my friend knew she was my therapist which she does. She told me that my friend has been intentionally reaching out to her to attend the same class, that they‚Äôve talked several times, and that she‚Äôs been supporting my friend through some things. This is someone who is deeply in my circle whom I have processed situations with in therapy. Knowing my friend it doesn‚Äôt surprise me that she would pursue a friendship with my therapist despite the obvious weirdness of it but it does surprise me that my therapist wouldn‚Äôt hold a boundary there with her instead of asking me to change how I discuss that relationship. It now creates this dynamic where I‚Äôm unable to process in certain ways because I‚Äôm having to respect my therapists boundaries. 

My therapist has been an amazing support in a really rough patch in my life. I‚Äôm not sure how to express my concerns. ",9,1732825999.0,TalkTherapy,5,0.92,False

After changing clothes and checking my phone, the notification sound of the rice cooker echoed in the room. Because I was too busy, I ate at restaurants and convenience stores this week. But today I started cooking again.

I opened the lid of the rice cooker and the aroma of rice spread lightly.

The appetizing aroma is caused by the carbonyl compounds produced by the reaction of amino acids, produced by the decomposition of protein contained in rice and sugar after the decomposition of starch.

I took the bowl in my left hand and the spoon in my right hand.

I put the rice in the bowl according to the normal amount.

Then I put a small portion of rice in another tea bowl - this is the subconscious action of my left hand.

""That's enough, right?""

This muscle memory has appeared frequently in recent months.

I put the side dishes and miso soup on the tray and moved to the table in the bedroom.

Compared with a few days ago, the room layout is a bit unsettling.

From the beginning of the relationship to the past few days, Karuizawa's personal belongings have increased slowly every day.

It's no wonder that I'm not used to it disappearing all of a sudden.

By the way, the piled up personal belongings were picked up by a few friends of Karuizawa.

Sato, Shinohara and Ishikura(?). It's good to have partners who can help.

Among them, Sato still doubts whether Karuizawa really dumped me. Although she cares very much, the facts presented on the surface will not change.

In the end, I repeatedly explained that I was the one who was dumped.

I know that continuing to strongly deny is ignorant of human nature.

But this is the best choice. Although Karuizawa Kei is a girl with a clumsy side, she has a good appearance, friends, and a place in the class. On the other hand, I am a dark side character. Such a person breaking up with Karuizawa will become a stain on her in the future. In fact, Karuizawa is indeed not at fault.

When I turned on the TV and ate breakfast, the screen of my mobile phone lit up.

„ÄéGood morning. Can we meet today?„Äè

I received a message like this.

When I was thinking about leaving it as read after eating, another message came.

„ÄéYou should be free after your girlfriend dumped you„Äè

""Did Horikita hear it too?""

I thought it would spread more slowly during the spring break...

Girls' information network may be as fast as light.

I had no choice but to pick up my phone and reply.

""After 10 o'clock, I can do it.""

""Then let's meet at the cafe in the Keyaki shopping center at 11 o'clock.""

After two rounds of arguing, we decided to meet.



I met up with Horikita who was waiting at the Keyaki shopping center, and then we went to the cafe.

But business was booming today, so we had to wait for several tables.

""What a headache.""

""I can wait or change places, either way is fine with me.""

When asked if she wanted to register her name on the paper, Horikita seemed a little hesitant.

""...really? Then let's change places. We can just sit on a bench, right?""

I didn't mind it, so I followed Horikita and started moving.

The stool next to the vending machine near the toilet on the second floor was empty, so we decided to sit there.

""I'll treat you, Ayanokouji-kun.""

""I see, then I should have stayed at the cafe. Let's go back.""

""I'm not treating you at the cafe, are you still going back?""

""...I see.""

""So? If you really want to pay for it yourself, I won't stop you at all.""

""Then I'll have hot coffee, without sugar.""

If I talk back, she won't treat me, so I'll just be quiet here.

It's obvious that we'll be short of money in the future, so we have to cherish even 1 yen.

Horikita bought two bottles of the same drink from a vending machine and handed one to me.

""Drink it while it's hot, it'll give you a taste of being single.""

""Are you comforting me or teasing me?""

""I don't know, which one is it?""

Probably...no, it's undoubtedly teasing me.

After staring at me for a while, Horikita tilted her head with a skeptical expression.

""Did you really break up with Karuizawa-san? To be honest, I can't believe it.""

""I'm not hiding anything, it's true. Where did you hear the information?""

""Kushida-san excitedly told me that you were dumped. Do you want to know what he said?""

I want to prepare for the future and confirm how it's being spread now.

""Tell me, let me know.""

""You cried and said you didn't want to break up, while desperately grabbing Karuizawa's legs and doing this and that.""

It seems a bit too pathetic...

""I don't think you, who is calm and composed, would do such a thing, but I'll just take it as the truth.""

""Ah‚Äî‚Äî""

""Just kidding. Even Kushida-san doesn't seem to know how you broke up.""

After all, we chose a karaoke room to avoid being seen.

Of course, if Karuizawa explained it like this, I would have to accept it.

No...even then, I still couldn't help but want to resist. I felt relieved for the time being.

Although I have realized it to some extent, I learned today that you should do things in moderation.

""Anyway, I'm not worthy of her.""

""Really? I don't think so. I think Karuizawa-san cherishes you very much.""

""Women are born to show off. Or maybe she found a better partner.""

Horikita showed a complicated expression on her face at my casual explanation.

""Although I can't deny this possibility...""

""What? Your look deep in thought.""

""I wanted to enjoy your despair, but you look indifferent.""

Such a superficial topic, she should have solved it with text messages or phone calls.

""Did you specifically ask for a meeting just to confirm my expression?""

""Indeed.""

What a mean character.

""If I continue to talk about the relationship between men and women, I will become sour. Let's stop here for now.""

""Please stop here.""

Horikita finally got to the point.

""Actually, it was about what happened in Maezono after the special exam. It's hard to be cheerful in the current atmosphere, right? Everyone feels a little off the mark.""

""Well, maybe. Everyone is paying attention to the chaos in other classes.""

It's not surprising that they should be more happy and excited about the victory.

But now the topic of the lower-ranked class is a hot topic.

""Yeah. So I thought that before the third year, everyone in the class would have a celebration party to celebrate the promotion.""

""Celebrate the promotion?""

""It's actually very simple, everyone gathers together and drinks.""

She wants to hear my opinion on this idea.

""After all, it's hard to discuss this kind of thing with other classmates, isn't it?""

""That's right.""

Although we won on the surface, the price was that Maezono dropped out of school.

Until the spring break, the atmosphere in the class was still a bit stiff.

Horikita thought it would be great if this atmosphere could be eliminated a little.

""Not bad - it's a good idea. But what about the venue?""

""If nearly 40 people gather, it will cause trouble to the people around if you don't choose the place carefully, right? So I thought about using the school classroom on the day off. The money will only be spent on drinks. How about next Friday?""

All club activities are closed on that day, so it's the most suitable venue.

After that, just wait for the school to approve.

""I agree""

""Can you come?""

""There's no reason to refuse""

""Really? That's good""

After a brief moment of happiness, Horikita's expression darkened a little.

""One more thing. There is a reason for calling you out, although I don't know if it's a bit self-indulgent.""

For a few seconds after speaking, Horikita was silent. It seemed that it was a bit difficult to speak.

""Your heart, isn't it hurt? I'm a little worried.""

""Heart?""

""You prioritized the victory of the class, which resulted in Maezono dropping out. Making this decision must have put a lot on you.""

""I'm the one who wanted to be the general. Horikita doesn't need to take it to heart.""

""Not just this time, but also the incident with Sakura. You took on a responsibility that no one wants to take on, and helped the class.""

There was a hint of hesitation in Horikita's eyes as she looked at me.

""Because of my weakness, you have to bear more burdens...""

""I did everything on my own initiative. You don't need to feel guilty.""

""Of course I have to feel guilty. I understand my lack of strength, so I want to be your spiritual support. If you feel tormented, I hope you can tell the truth and say that you want help.""

I can understand what Horikita means.

Indeed, if other students take similar actions, most people will be heartbroken.

Unfortunately, I don't have that kind of feeling.

What is high efficiency, and what is useless work.

Who goes, and who stays.

Make judgments like a machine.

There is no need for Horikita to understand this kind of feeling, nor do I want her to understand it.

No, even if I tell the truth here, it will be considered as putting on a front.

""I understand what you mean, but it doesn't matter now. I will definitely consult you when I'm in trouble.""

""--really?""

""Sorry to worry you.""

""Not at all...I just want to be your strength, that's all.""

""That statement may be misunderstood.""

""...misunderstood?""

Horikita tilted her head, not understanding what it meant.

""It feels a bit like a confession.""

""...huh?""

""I'm a free man now, are you going to apply as a lover candidate?""

After making it clear, Horikita seemed to finally understand what I was talking about.

""...hey, you've become a talker too.""

While sighing, Horikita glared at me.

""Rather than the dropping out incident, I was just pretending to be strong to cover up the sadness after being dumped by my girlfriend, so please forgive me.""

""I really don't understand.""

After we finished our drinks, we talked briefly again.

2.

On the way back. After parting with Ayanokouji who stopped by the bookstore, Horikita walked towards the dormitory alone.

The warm spring breeze blew, and her long hair fluttered in the wind.

""Candidate for lover...huh?""

Although it was a nonsense joke, Horikita looked back on the past.

Two years have passed since she met Ayanokouji.

It's natural that they have become a relationship where they can naturally tease each other.

But there are still some things that made her worry.

""He is the only one who can make me talk in that way.""

Horikita wouldn't talk to others the way she talks to Ayanokouji.

Whether it's Kushida or Ibuki, or other students.

There are always parts that can't be let go.

She realized that there are some things about Ayanokouji that don't match classmates or friends.

Closer to her than anyone else, constantly watching over her.

In these two years, Horikita has definitely let down her guard against Ayanokouji.

""But even so, lovers...""

Ridiculous.

As she thought, Horikita felt her heartbeat slightly.

A subtle signal from the body that could not be noticed in a noisy environment.

""...what was that just now...""

A strange feeling in the heart that she had never experienced before.

Nervousness?

https://preview.redd.it/33qfppj7dp3e1.jpg?width=901&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=564f23c8c751b5799e195dcf3e307f89679f4fb9

Even if she had such a question, she immediately knew it was not the case, and erased it from her mind.

So, what is the reason for her heartbeat getting faster now?

She recalled the arrogant words left by Ayanokouji, who had disappeared.

""Are you going to apply as a lover candidate?""

An incomprehensible gaze from above.

Why would she even be a lover candidate for someone she didn't like?

What does it mean to like?

What does it mean to dislike?

Could she, who never had any awareness of the opposite sex, understand?

""Forget it, it was just a joke. Thinking about it seriously is a waste of effort, it's ridiculous.""

Horikita wanted to get rid of this evil thought, but couldn't get rid of it smoothly.

""...no, don't think about it anymore.""

Horikita decided to empty her mind.

Because she understood: thinking about it would only make her fall into a quagmire.",12,1732825992.0,Horikitafanclub,4,0.94,False

Went to trap in under a cup to get a closer look, but it had disappeared! Found the same bug (or a very similar looking one) under the same pillow today. From what I can tell, it measures approximately 4mm in length, has 6 legs, dark in colour, with a vertical line down the back and what appear to be wings. Almost looks like a tiny coffee bean.

My questions are:

1) What is this bug in my house???
2) Is it something to be concerned about?

Recently got back from a hotel, in case this info helps. I'm deathly afraid of infestations, praying it's not a bedbug or something else problematic.

I wanted to share something that's genuinely made a huge difference for me lately. For what feels like forever, I've been dealing with constant bloating (the kind where your clothes suddenly don't fit), those brutal afternoon energy crashes, and brain fog that made even simple tasks feel impossible.

At first, I just blamed it on the usual suspects - stress, busy schedule, not eating perfectly, whatever. But it kept happening, and I started thinking there might be something bigger going on.

That's when I stumbled across research about the gut-brain axis during one of my late-night health anxiety scrolling sessions (we've all been there, right?). Mind = blown. Your gut and brain are literally in constant communication, and your gut health affects everything from your mood to your focus to your energy levels. Who knew?

I decided to dive deeper into gut health research and started implementing some changes. It's been about a month, and honestly? The difference is wild:

* That ""6-months-pregnant"" bloating? Almost completely gone
* Those 2PM energy crashes where I needed 3 coffees just to function? Way less frequent
* The brain fog that made me feel like I was thinking through mud? Finally lifting

Here's the thing - I'm not doing anything extreme. Started with some basic lifestyle changes:

LIFESTYLE:

* Eating slowly and mindfully (actually chewing food properly now)
* No food 3 hours before bed
* 15-min walks after meals
* Basic stress management (10-min meditation)

DIET CHANGES:

* Added fermented foods (kimchi, Greek yogurt, kefir)
* More fiber-rich foods (chia seeds, flax, leafy greens)
* Cut back on processed foods and sugar
* Staying hydrated (tracking water intake)

Here's what made the biggest difference (combo of supplements):

**1. Probiotic + digestive enzymes**¬†for improved digestion.

2.¬†**Mind & gut complex**¬†\- really helped with brain fog and energy

3.¬†**Zinc -**¬†for gut barrier support.

4.¬†**L-Glutamine -**¬†to help repair my gut lining.

**5. Vitamin complex -**¬†this reduced inflammation and helped balance my gut microbiota. (Just finished, so can't find the bottle, soooorrry!)

**P.S.**¬†Not to get, what really set the stage for these changes was starting with a simple 14-day detox. It acted as a gentle reset for my gut, helping to reduce bloating, improve digestion, and make me feel lighter overall. During those two weeks, I made some big changes to my diet as well. Before, I was eating a lot of processed foods, sugary snacks, and honestly, meals that were more about convenience than nutrition.

With the detox, I focused on eating cleaner - things like leafy greens, chia seeds, and flax, along with fermented foods like kimchi and yogurt. I cut out processed foods and drastically reduced sugar, which was a huge shift for me. It wasn‚Äôt easy at first, but by the end of the two weeks, I noticed a huge difference in how I felt. It really seemed like my body was finally ready to absorb all the good stuff I was introducing, and it motivated me to stick to healthier habits moving forward.

On top of these changes, I‚Äôve been using this one too as part of my routine - it‚Äôs a gentle gut cleanse 14 day complex.

**Plus**¬†added in anti-inflammatory foods (turmeric, ginger) and gut-soothing teas (chamomile, peppermint). The supplements combined with better eating habits really seemed to make everything click.

It's not just about digestion - my energy is better, mood is more stable, and I actually feel clear-headed again. It's wild how connected everything is.

I keep seeing posts about similar symptoms, so I'm curious - has anyone else looked into the gut-brain connection? What's worked for you?

Let's share experiences - honestly feels like this might be the missing piece for a lot of us who've been feeling ""off"" without knowing why.

**P.S.**¬†In just a month, I‚Äôve managed to lose 3 kg, feel lighter and more energized, and most importantly, regain control of my health. This journey has been nothing short of transformative, and I‚Äôm incredibly proud of the progress I‚Äôve made.¬†**For the first time in a long while, I truly feel like the best version of myself!!!!!!**",6,1732825438.0,Microbiome,0,1.0,False

I've been having hard system crashes where my display will freeze, then restart every few minutes or so. I've narrowed it down to either my ram or power supply. I switched my ram sticks around and it didn't crash for about a week, but now its doing it again. I switched my ram sticks back, and its stopped for the time being, but just now i was getting massive frame drops on siege while monitoring my psu and ram and this is what i saw.

Are my sticks just shorting out rn? or is my PSU fucking up? Both are pretty cheap repairs, but I'm just curious as too what this looks like to someone else.

I wanted to get a coffee and I needed to go to the store. He says why the fuck do you need a coffee (I drink a fucken coffee every single day, my body is dependent on it and even if it wasn't it's MY FUCKING CAR AND I WANT A COFFEE AND NEED TO GO TO THE STORE.) So thr whole fucken way there he's talking shit to me, oh and then makes me stop at the gas station so he can fucken get his white claw -because you know that's more acceptable for him to get in the morning, but not me to get my coffee. So I drop him off, while back at the room I ask for a late check out at 11:30 I leave and specifically leave a note on the door stating that I got a late check out. So of course my fucking luck I pick him up and he goes up to the room to shower and they're already cleaning it. So I go to the front desk and tell them the situation, the lady says she'll go talk to housekeeping. So I call him and tell him that and he says fuck it I'm not going back. He says it's ""embarrassing"" for him. He refuses to go back like a fucking CHILD. Then after that now it's my fault that he didn't shower and I never hear the end of it.

I'm just curious about coffee drip machines in different cafes.
My owner is planning to change the machines were using for our batch brew.
 We've been on a bunn machine that's as old as the shop, and due to londons fabulous water I have a slight feeling it's more limescale than metal on the inside now.

So my owner is considering either
The moccamaster KBG or the Ratio coffee brewer. Obviously these are more home machines than for commercial use. So I'm curious to what people would recommend to brew filter, with an average of about 6-7 liters of batch going daily. Mostly light too medium roast.
