I was just about to take a sip of the milk Ethan handed me when, out of nowhere, my phone started ringing. 

The caller said. “Don’t drink it. It’s been drugged” 

My hand trembled so hard that I nearly spilled the milk 

The voice on the other end sounded frantic. 

The caller said. “We only have half a minute to talk. so listen carefully. 

This is Melissa. I’m calling from tomorrow. Right now, I’m at your funeral. 

“At 3 AM. your husband is going to throw you off the balcony while you’re asleep. You’ll die from the fall” 

I froze, instinctively glancing at Ethan, who seemed so caring and gentle. I couldn’t believe what I heard. 

The voice on the other end continued, speaking slowly and clearly. 

She said. “If you don’t believe me, check his secret WhatsApp account. He’s been seeing another woman behind your back for a long time. 

“His whole plan is to set you up to die in an ‘accident‘ during this honeymoon. 

“Listen, if you want to live, don’t let your guard down. You have to find me before 3 AM. I’ll keep you safe.” 

Then the call abruptly cut off. 

I was totally baffled. Melissa was my best friend, and she was fast asleep in the next room. 

How could she have called me with something so bizarre? 

I tried calling back, but the number was invalid. 

Ethan came out of the kitchen, flashing me a warm smile as he nudged me. 

He said, “What’s wrong, babe? Hurry up and drink your milk before it gets cold.” 

Staring at Ethan’s gentle smile, I couldn’t shake off this uneasy feeling creeping up inside me. 

Even if I wanted to dismiss that call as a sick joke, I couldn’t ignore it. Not when my life was on the line. 

I made up some random excuse, set the milk aside, and headed to Melissa’s room, phone in hand. 

But when I confronted Melissa, she just shook her head and denied everything. 

“What are you even talking about? It’s pouring outside, and the signal’s dead. I couldn’t have called you even if I wanted to,” Melissa said.

Chapter 1 

Sure enough, when I checked my phone, I had zero bars. 

I was utterly bewildered: what was that phone call I’d just received? 

I heard that voice loud and clear. It was unmistakably Melissa. 

Could it really have been Melissa from the future calling me? 

Just replaying her words in my mind made my skin crawl. 

Ethan was busy in the kitchen, and his phone was just sitting there on the coffee table. 

Luckily, Ethan never bothered to lock his phone around me, so I unlocked it in no time.

When I saw the messages from the insurance agent on his WhatsApp, the hairs on my arms stood on end. 

Ethan had actually taken out an accidental death insurance policy on me just before our honeymoon. And he was listed as the sole beneficiary. 

I clutched my chest, my heart pounding out of control. I tried to convince myself that it had to be just a coincidence. 

But when I switched over to his secret WhatsApp account, the only contact listed there made my blood run cold. 

It was a contact with no name, just a girl’s profile pic. The chat was packed with her own private selfies and a flood of angry questions. 

She texted: \[When are you finally going to divorce her? 

\[Ethan, could you kill her? That way, you’d be mine forever.\] 

The more I scrolled, the more my hands trembled. 

Suddenly, a cold voice rang out behind me. 

Ethan asked, “Honey, what are you looking at?” 

I instinctively shook my head and hurriedly closed everything on the phone, trying to make it look untouched. 

I said, “It’s nothing, really. My phone just lost signal, so I wanted to check if yours was acting up too.” 

Ethan’s cold demeanor eased a bit, and he gave me a faint smile. 

He said, “That makes sense. It’s probably just the storm messing with the signal. It should be back to normal once the rain clears up tomorrow. 

“Don’t overthink it. Come on. Have some fruit, honey.” He brought over a plate of sliced fruit. 

I forced a smile, reaching for a piece of fruit, ready to eat it.

But I stopped myself and set it back down. 

Looking back now, that phone call was most likely real.

If Ethan really had been trying to kill me while I slept, then my not drinking the milk meant he definitely would have tried to drug me with something else. 

I checked the time. 

It was 11 PM. There were five hours to go until 3 AM. 

As long as I stayed close to Melissa until then, I should be safe. 

I managed a weak smile. 

I said, “Honey, my stomach doesn’t feel so good. I think I’ll skip the fruit tonight. I’ll sleep in Melissa’s room, okay?” 

“No way,” Ethan shot back. 

Ethan, who never said no to me before, was suddenly weirdly firm. 

I was stunned, totally at a loss for words. 

Just then, Melissa came out of her room, looking like she was about to watch a show. She said, “Are you two fighting? 

“Listen up, Ethan. Laura’s my bestie, and if you even think about messing with her, my fists will have something to say about it.” 

Melissa was a sports school grad, always loud and straightforward. 

Hearing her, I instantly felt a bit safer and quickly shot Melissa a desperate, secret look, hoping she’d pick up on my silent plea. 

Melissa got the message instantly and jumped in, saying I should sleep in her room with her. 

Ethan’s face darkened as he gave Melissa a look I couldn’t quite figure out, then glanced at me. He still wouldn’t back down. 

He insisted, “No way. Laura’s with me tonight. 

“We’re newlyweds. This is our honeymoon. Having you here as a third wheel is already pushing it.” 

Melissa never liked Ethan. She always thought he was sketchy. 

Since this honeymoon was happening abroad, she only came along because she was worried I might get into trouble. 

But after Ethan said that, Melissa had no choice but to back off.

1pycoas,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeAdmissionsPH/comments/1pycoas/my_experience_working_with_kingston_international/,My Experience Working With Kingston International College Singapore and Apex Company,"My Experience Working With Kingston International College Singapore and Apex Company

This post is about Kingston International College (Singapore) and the recruitment and operations company Apex that works with and promotes its programs.

I worked for Apex remotely in a consultant and operations role, directly involved in recruiting, student communication, payments, and internal processes related to Kingston International College programs.

1) Work Conditions at Apex

I regularly worked 10–12 hours per day, 5.5 days a week, often starting earlier than scheduled and staying late due to constant pressure and unrealistic expectations.
Overtime was enforced but never paid.

There was no proper employment structure. No official contract, no legal protections, and no transparency around pay calculations.

The work environment was extremely toxic. Being shouted at, pressured, blamed, and publicly scolded was normal. Management relied heavily on fear, guilt, and constant urgency to push people to work longer hours. Taking any kind of break was looked down on, for example; going to the toilet for over 5 minutes, getting coffee, or not working extra on the 1 day off.

After resignation, earned commissions were withheld, despite being completed and tracked while employed. The only explanation given was that employment had ended.

2) Verbal Abuse and Intimidation

Verbal abuse from management was frequent and normalized.

I was:
	•	Called stupid, useless, and incompetent
	•	Spoken to in a degrading and aggressive manner during calls
	•	Subjected to intimidation, including statements involving threats toward my family
	•	Publicly humiliated as a way to apply pressure

There was no HR, no reporting system, and no accountability. This behavior was tolerated internally and treated as normal.

This environment had a serious impact on my mental health and was a major reason for leaving.

3) The Reality of Kingston International College Programs

This is the part potential students need to read carefully.

Internship Pay Is Misrepresented

Students are often told internships pay around 900 SGD.
In reality, many receive only 400 SGD per month.

The remaining amount is taken by intermediaries or classified as fees, without this being clearly explained upfront.

Students are expected to live in Singapore, one of the most expensive cities in Asia, on 400 SGD, often without proper warning.

Internship placements are frequently low skill service or retail roles, including cafés, convenience stores, or similar positions. This is not transparently disclosed during recruitment.

4) Diplomas and Education Value

The diplomas offered through Kingston International College are private diplomas with limited recognition.

There are no guaranteed outcomes, despite how the programs are marketed. Many of the skills taught can be learned independently or through far cheaper alternatives.

5) Bali Programs

The Bali programs promoted by Apex are extremely overpriced for what they offer.

Participants are effectively doing the same work as staff, under long hours and pressure, while paying to participate. The “training” aspect is overstated, and participants are treated more like unpaid labor than students.

6) Final Warning

This post is based on direct firsthand experience working inside Apex and dealing with Kingston International College programs.

If you are considering:
	•	working for Apex
	•	enrolling in a Kingston International College programs
	•	joining their Bali programs

Ask for everything in writing, including:
	•	net pay after deductions
	•	internship job type and location
	•	diploma recognition
	•	legal protections
	•	refund and exit terms

If answers are vague, rushed, or change depending on who you speak to, take that as a serious red flag.",2,1766982852.0,CollegeAdmissionsPH,0,1.0,False

This has become a fun hobby that has resulted in weekend rituals, conversations, and sharing my creations with friends over breakfast. With so many devices and tools out there I truly do think this is a fun way to be creative and to make something you can be proud of. 

The Ratio Six is the newest addition to the lineup. Still working on the recipe I like for it. Any suggestions are welcomed!

Looking forward to a new espresso machine in the new year. The Hibrew H10a has been a fun machine to learn on, but after a little more interest in the hobby an upgrade will be a welcomed sight. This was my first piece of equipment I bought. Been using this machine for nearly 2 years. With bi-monthly deep cleaning this still runs exceptionally well. 

After a little trial and error the Encore ESP Pro has been a nice addition for those mornings on the go when I dont want to mess with the K6 grinder which makes very nice espresso.

1pycird,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pycird/i_think_my_friend_likes_my_boyfriend_and_im_not/,I think my friend likes my boyfriend and I’m not sure how to confront her.,"Okay so me (16F) and my bf (17M) have been in a relationship for a few months. I love him and he is a great and very loyal boyfriend who respects and loves me infinitely more than I deserve. I’m homeschooled and my friends go to public school along with my bf (they knew him first and I met him through them bc they go to my church), and they all know each other really well bc they all go to the same events for school, which I think is a green flag bc my friends think my bf is a great guy. The issue is, one of my friends, we’ll call her Sarah (18F), talks to him wayyy more than she should. He’s really loyal and my friends are also his main friends so I totally get them talking a lot and him engaging in conversations. I honestly didn’t notice the issue until it got bad enough for one of my other close friends, we’ll call her Megan (18F), to bring it up. We were out for coffee when she said she noticed how oddly close Sara is with him. She mentioned how it made her feel bad for me bc of how much Sara laughs and lowk flirts with him whenever she’s around him. He’s a very oblivious person when it comes to girls (he didn’t know I liked him when I made it so obvious), so I know he means no harm when he engages in conversations with Sara, bc he doesn’t know she might have a thing for him. The thing that makes me kind of brush it off is that she has a very flirty personality so it’s not out of the ordinary, but even if I had a flirty personality, I would never flirt with my friends bf. Is it bad that I feel uncomfortable with that or am I just self centered? Bc I love that we’re all friends, my bf is very honest about his past relationships or crushes, and I’m not a jealous person, it just doesn’t sit right with me. It’s not him at all, it’s the fact that something about the way she acts with him makes me think she likes him. Does anyone have any advice on how to confront her?

“So he died in that fire right” May said, her voice low as she leaned back in the booth.

“That’s what they say,” Sarah replied. She flipped open her notebook and clicked her pen. “Let’s lay out a timeline again.”

Sarah and May had lived in this town their entire lives. They went to the same schools, sat through the same church services, made the same friends, and grew up hearing the same stories whispered at sleepovers and repeated at bonfires. One story had always been there, constant and unchanging in spirit if not in detail. The silk leather witch. They had heard it so many times they could almost recite it from memory.

The story shifted depending on who told it. When they were little she lived in a well. When they were in their early teens the well had turned into a house in the woods. Sometimes there was a barn. Sometimes a workshop. Sometimes you were cursed just for looking at it. But everyone agreed on one thing. For the last three hundred years the witch had been kept at bay by salt. People said the town even employed workers whose only job was to make sure the barrier was never broken. But some say that the salt circle is no more.   

“So,” Sarah said, already writing, “early seventeen hundreds. The silk leather witch is caught selling clothes and goods made from the skin of townspeople.”

May smiled faintly. “Super cheap though.”

Sarah wanted to smile but didn’t.  
“Then she was hanged, burned, and thrown into a well,” she said, her pen scratching across the page. “And the town secretly kept watch to make sure she never got out.”

May took a slow sip of her coffee. “Uh huh,” she said, her tone lightly sarcastic. “Right.”

Sarah pressed on. “And then, what, fifteen years ago after everyone had more or less agreed it was just an old urban legend, the town starts hearing about a company that’s routinely pouring salt around a house in the middle of the woods.”

“More like ten years ago I think” May said. “I remember hearing about it for the first time. It scared the hell out of me.”

Sarah opened her mouth to ask another question, but May cut in first.

“Did you ever go out there and kick the salt circle?” May asked, smiling.

“No. Definitely not,” Sarah replied immediately. “Did you?”

“No,” May said, then hesitated. “But I always wanted to see it. I just never worked up the nerve to actually go.”

Sarah nodded, then flipped to a fresh page in her notebook. “Okay. So then the house and a large chunk of the surrounding woods catch fire. No clear cause. Something like a hundred acres burned.”

“My dad is convinced it was the development company,” May said. “He says after twenty years of stalled plans they finally got tired of fighting and decided to clear the land themselves. Figured people would stop defending the woods if there weren’t any left.”

“That feels like a stretch,” Sarah said.

“You’re right,” May replied dryly. “It’s much more reasonable that a witch escaped and burned everything to the ground.”

Sarah rolled her eyes but kept writing. “The house burned down last year, right?”

“Yeah,” May said, her voice quieter this time. “And that’s when Hutch died” She added

“Well,” Sarah said, continuing to write, her pen slowing slightly. “He was never found, but he is presumed dead I think.”

May leaned back and stared into her coffee for a moment. “Who do you think posted his journal online?” she asked. “Do you actually believe it was his?”

Sarah hesitated. The café was quiet enough that the scrape of her pen against the paper sounded louder than it should have. “I honestly have no idea,” she said. “It reads like something someone would fake, but there are parts that feel too specific. Too personal.”

“Like he wasn’t writing for anyone else,” May said softly.

“Exactly,” Sarah replied. “And if someone else found it, why post it at all? Why not turn it over to the police, or the family, or anyone?”

May frowned. “What if it was Murph”.

Sarah stopped writing. “The supervisor guy”

“Yeah” May said. “Think about it. Hutch writes about him a lot. Not in a bad way either. He says Murph respected the town. Respected how hard people fought to keep the woods from getting bulldozed.”

“That doesn’t mean he posted the journal” Sarah said, though she did not sound convinced.

“No but it gives him a motive” May replied. “The company stalls for years. Everyone fights them. Then suddenly the woods burn. The house burns. Hutch disappears. And somehow his journal ends up online.”

Sarah frowned. “You think Murph took it”

“I think Murph might have been the only one who could” May said. “He had access. He knew Hutch was writing everything down. And if the company really did burn the land to force development through…” She trailed off.

“…then posting the journal would be a way to make sure people never forgot” Sarah finished.

“Or a way to make sure no one ever touched that land again” May added. “You read the comments when the journal first went up. People were terrified. Urban explorers started showing up. Forums blew up. The place became a hive of activity.”

Sarah slowly nodded. “Hutch did say Murph respected the townspeople. He understood why people wanted to protect the woods.”

“Exactly” May said. “Burn the land and take Hutch with it, and Murph makes sure the story survives. Not just the fire. Not just the disappearance. The witch. The salt. The house. All of it.”

Sarah looked back down at her notes. “So either Murph exposed everything out of spite” she said, “or he was trying to warn people.”

Sarah wrote down their discussion, but something didn’t sit right with her. The company’s desire to finally clear the land for development was one thing, but including Hutch in the story seemed unnecessary. Maybe he was just an unfortunate byproduct, she thought, but she wasn’t fully convinced.

“Were you able to actually find out who Murph or John were?” Sarah asked.

“Not even close,” May replied.

“Yeah, we might have some luck tracking down Murph, but there’s no way we can figure out who John really was. Hutch never even met him,” Sarah explained.

“Well, he went to meet him at the house at the end of his journal,” May said confidently.

“That wasn’t John, May,” Sarah said firmly.

“What?” May exclaimed. “Then who was it?”

“The witch,” Sarah whispered, leaning in slightly, as if she feared someone might overhear.

“Do you actually believe the witch is real, Sarah?” May asked, her tone skeptical but curious.

“Do you not?” Sarah shot back, her eyes narrowing.

May was taken aback. She had always enjoyed the creepy lore and the folktale atmosphere of the journal, but she believed that Hutch’s story was ultimately about a conspiracy and a company willing to do anything to move forward with their development plans. Meanwhile, Sarah was certain that the witch was real. In her mind, Hutch had been lured to the house by the witch herself, who had taken on the guise of John. She believed he had unknowingly broken the very barrier that had kept the witch dormant for centuries, and that the dark consequences he faced were the result of crossing a force far older and far more malevolent than any human adversary.

“Shall we read through the journal again and highlight any inconsistencies?” Sarah asked, breaking the short, tense silence that had settled between them.

“Why don’t we just go there,” May said sharply, her tone leaving no room for argument.

“Go to the house?” Sarah exclaimed, her eyes wide. “Surely there would be tons of security.”

“Yeah, maybe at the front gate, but I’m not suggesting we go in through the front,” May replied, a spark of determination in her voice.

“Is it still a crime scene?” Sarah asked, hoping the thought of legal trouble might slow May down a little.

“I think this is our logical next step,” May said bluntly. “We’ve gotten nowhere trying to track down the coffee shop he went to, it’s definitely not the one we’re in now” She said in reference to an awkward conversation they had with the barista when the entered the Café “ We have no idea who Murph is, no idea who John is, and we’ve gotten nowhere with the company.”

Sarah hesitated, then added, “We did find that obituary online that listed one of the guys’ professions as a salt tender.”

“That could just mean he laid down salt in the winter, Sarah” May said, shrugging slightly, though her eyes gleamed with purpose. “We should go check it out. No more waiting. It’s time to see it for ourselves.”

They agreed to go to Salt House in person the following day, though the decision settled very differently on Sarah than it did on May. The more Sarah researched the place, the more it felt less like an investigation and more like an invitation she had already accepted without realizing it. Every detail she uncovered seemed to pull her a little closer, as if learning about Salt House was not a passive act but something that noticed her in return. There was an uncomfortable sense that by digging into the story she was not uncovering history, but instead falling for some supernatural bait that was luring her towards a terrible end.

Sarah woke at 2:30 a.m. without warning. There had been no dream, no noise to jolt her awake, just a sudden and complete awareness of the dark. The house was silent in that way only sleeping homes can be, heavy and unmoving. Sleep refused to return. Her thoughts kept circling back to the journal, to Simon Hutchinson’s final entries, to what his last moments might have been like inside that house. The thought lodged itself in her chest and would not let go.

Sarah was twenty, the same age as May, and like May she still lived with her parents. Their house was typical for the area, modest in size but surrounded by land. Nearly forty acres stretched out behind it, dissolving into thick woods that no one really used anymore. She sat up in bed and stared out the rear window, letting her eyes adjust to the darkness.

That was when she saw the light.

It was faint at first, almost easy to dismiss, a pale glow tucked deep among the trees. Her first instinct was to ignore it. There was nothing back there. No roads, no structures, nothing but forest. But the longer she stared, the more the shape resolved itself. The light was not round or scattered like a reflection. It was sharp. Square. A window.

Sarah’s breath caught as the realization settled in. The trees beyond her window did not shift or sway. There was no wind, no rustling leaves, no movement at all. The light did not flicker or pulse. It simply existed, steady and deliberate, as if it had always been there and she was only just now being permitted to notice it. The longer she stared, the more it felt like the light was not illuminating the darkness so much as pressing against it.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand, the sudden vibration making her flinch.

Hey are you awake.  
The text was from May.

Sarah’s eyes snapped back to the window. The light was gone. The trees were dark again, a solid wall of black. She blinked hard and rubbed her eyes, her heart still pounding. Maybe she had been half asleep. Maybe her mind was filling in shapes that were not really there. She typed back a single word.

Yes.

Her phone rang almost immediately. She answered it without thinking and whispered, “May, everything ok?”

“I’m fine,” May replied, her voice low and tense, matching Sarah’s tone. “I just had the craziest dream.”

Sarah sat very still as May spoke. She described walking through the woods toward a house with only one window lit. Every other window was completely black, like empty sockets, but that one square of light glowed unnaturally bright. In the dream she kept walking closer, step by step, until she was maybe twenty feet away. That was when the light began to flicker. Just faintly at first. Then it went out completely.

May paused for a moment before continuing. She said she stood there staring at the dark window, waiting for her eyes to adjust. Slowly, a shape began to form inside. A silhouette that felt wrong somehow. As if it had been there the entire time, watching her, waiting for her to be close enough to see it.

“And then I woke up,” May said quietly. “It freaked me out so bad I had to call you.”

Sarah swallowed hard. She considered telling May about the light she had seen outside her own window, about how real it had looked, how impossible it was. But the words caught in her throat. Saying it out loud felt like making it real. Instead she forced a small laugh that did not sound convincing even to her.

“Do you think,” Sarah said carefully, “that maybe we should hold off on visiting the house tomorrow?”

There was a brief pause on the line. Then May scoffed.

“Hell no,” she said. “Eight am on the dot. I’ll be there. You’re not going to bail on me, right?”

“No,” Sarah replied, though the word felt heavy. “I’ll be there.”

“You better be,” May said, trying to sound playful. “If you’re not there, I’m going in alone.”

“I’ll be there,” Sarah said again, managing a small smile that May could not see.

They hung up a moment later. Sarah sat in the dark for a long time before finally glancing at her alarm clock. The red numbers glowed softly.

2:42 am.

She lay back down, fully expecting sleep to be impossible, but it came quickly and without warning, like being pulled under water.

When Sarah woke again, sunlight filled her room. She sat up abruptly, a sharp feeling of panic blooming in her chest. Her eyes went straight to the clock.

9:18 am.

For a moment she did not move at all. Then the dread set in, slow and absolute. She was already too late.

Sarah called May again and again while driving toward the site, each unanswered call made her chest feel slightly tighter. She told herself that May had probably been stopped by security or turned around at the gate but that thought died the moment she reached the pull off.

The gates were wide open.

The heavy chain that once sealed them lay coiled in the dirt like something discarded in a hurry. Signs promising future development still hung crookedly from the fencing, their bright colors faded and blistered by heat. Sarah and May had driven past this place more times than either of them could count, always slowing, always staring, never once daring to touch the gate. Now it stood open as if inviting her in.

Sarah drove through.

Trees closed in on her almost immediately, their blackened trunks leaning inward, crowding the road. The air grew thick and gritty, and then just as suddenly the forest fell away. The land opened into a vast hollow, a dead canvas carved out of the woods. Trees stood at the perimeter like a burned audience, while the interior was nothing but ash and ruin. The ground was scorched and uneven, littered with collapsed trunks and charcoal debris. It looked like something had been scooped out of the earth and never put back.

She slowed when she saw the concrete slab.

This had to be it HQ she thought. What remained of it was surrounded by warped piping, cracked ceramic, and half melted fixtures that had resisted the fire longer than everything else. The house came into view beyond it, and Sarah felt her stomach drop.

It was still standing.

The structure looked like it had been dipped in soot. Jet black and skeletal, its walls bowed and uneven, its windows empty. It no longer looked like a house so much as the idea of one, a crooked outline refusing to collapse. Fine particulates hung in the air, and a heavy fog pressed low against the ground, dark and unmoving. It was not even ten in the morning, but the light here felt like ten at night. Even the sun did not wish to visit this place.

May’s car was nowhere to be seen.

Sarah stepped out of her vehicle and immediately began to cough. The air burned her lungs. It was thin and suffocating, like she was breathing at the top of a mountain. Her hand stayed on the open car door as she shouted May’s name. Then screamed it. The sound was swallowed almost instantly, smothered by the fog and the dead space around her.

“May it’s me,” she called, her voice breaking. “It’s Sarah. Are you in there?”

Her mind betrayed her. Images rose of a burned figure twisting in agony. Skin split and blackened. A body that refused to die. Hung. Burned. Thrown screaming into a dry well. Sarah found herself hoping she would hear nothing, more than that she prayed that May had never made it this far.

Then a voice answered.

“Sarah.”

It was faint. Strained. Barely carried on the wind.

Sarah froze.

“May?” she shouted. “Is that you?”

“Yes,” the voice came back. “It’s me, Sarah. It’s May.”

The wind picked up suddenly, whistling through the empty windows of the house, tearing at the fog. The voice grew harder to hear, stretched thin like it was being pulled through something narrow. Tears blurred Sarah’s vision as she shouted again.

“Where are you?”

There was a pause. Just long enough to feel intentional.

“I need help,” the voice said. “I’m stuck.”

Sarah’s blood turned cold.

Stuck.

The word echoed in her head, colliding with the pages of the journal she had read and reread. John had said the same thing. Hutch had written it down. The pattern was far too familiar.

The voice came again, calmer now. Flat. It didn’t sound robotic as much as it sounded rehearsed.

“I fell down the stairs.”

Sarah felt bile rise in her throat.

She could not do this. She could not become the next line in the timeline they had been building. The next name spoken in past tense. Without thinking she slammed the car door shut, hands shaking as she fumbled with the ignition. The engine roared to life and she sped back down the road, gravel spraying behind her.

The wind battered the car as she drove, rocking it hard enough to make her swerve. And over it all, she swore she could hear screaming. Not carried by the wind, but woven into it, stretched and distorted, as if the land itself were crying out.

She did not stop until she reached the main road.

With trembling hands Sarah called May again. No answer. She called again. Still nothing.

Finally Sarah gave up and called the police.

It took days of questioning, though in Sarah’s memory it stretched and felt almost endless, as if time itself had been burned. She sat beneath buzzing fluorescent lights, repeating the same sentences to different faces, trying to explain why she had fled from the sound of her best friend crying out for help. Saying the words out loud made them sound absurd even to her. A witch. An imitation. A voice that was perfect and wrong at the same time. She watched the officers exchange glances, their pens slowing, their questions softening in a way that felt worse than accusation.

They told her they searched the property. Sarah nodded, but she did not believe them. She had been pulled away as soon as they arrived, guided gently but firmly away. never allowed to see what they saw. When she asked if anyone went inside the house, they said a hazmat team entered the following day and found nothing but the burned shell everyone already knew about. No stairs. No body. No sign that anyone had ever called out her name. The answer felt polished.

She spoke to May’s family more times than she could count, sitting at their kitchen table, answering the same questions she asked herself every night. She explained the journal, the research, the house, the theory that now sounded like madness in daylight. A missing persons case was opened, one of many that year, another name added to a growing list. Sarah searched anyway. She organized. She spoke. She drove back roads and hiked tree lines all to no avail. Years passed, but the memory of the last conversation she had with May never dulled. What if it really had been her. What if fear of a story had cost her best friend her own life.

The world continued in the way it always does, indifferent and relentless. Sarah grew older. She had children, May, James and Danny. For a while the past stayed where it belonged. Then, every so often, she would wake at 2:30 in the morning for no reason at all, her heart already racing before her eyes opened. She would sit up in bed and look out into the dark, and somewhere far beyond her yard, beyond the trees, a single square of light would be waiting.

At first she told herself it was exhaustion or stress. But the light never flickered. It never waivered. It simply was and as the years wore on the light took something from Sarah every time she saw it. She felt something inside her thinning, drying out, turning brittle. Memory and guilt and fear hollowed her slowly, patiently, until one morning she realized her mind felt exactly like that house in the woods. Burned hollow. Twisted. Standing only because it had not yet learned how to fall.",1,1766981282.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

The Always Waiting Window

 

“So he died in that fire right” May said, her voice low as she leaned back in the booth.

“That’s what they say,” Sarah replied. She flipped open her notebook and clicked her pen. “Let’s lay out a timeline again.”

Sarah and May had lived in this town their entire lives. They went to the same schools, sat through the same church services, made the same friends, and grew up hearing the same stories whispered at sleepovers and repeated at bonfires. One story had always been there, constant and unchanging in spirit if not in detail. The silk leather witch. They had heard it so many times they could almost recite it from memory.

The story shifted depending on who told it. When they were little she lived in a well. When they were in their early teens the well had turned into a house in the woods. Sometimes there was a barn. Sometimes a workshop. Sometimes you were cursed just for looking at it. But everyone agreed on one thing. For the last three hundred years the witch had been kept at bay by salt. People said the town even employed workers whose only job was to make sure the barrier was never broken. But some say that the salt circle is no more.   

“So,” Sarah said, already writing, “early seventeen hundreds. The silk leather witch is caught selling clothes and goods made from the skin of townspeople.”

May smiled faintly. “Super cheap though.”

Sarah wanted to smile but didn’t.  
“Then she was hanged, burned, and thrown into a well,” she said, her pen scratching across the page. “And the town secretly kept watch to make sure she never got out.”

May took a slow sip of her coffee. “Uh huh,” she said, her tone lightly sarcastic. “Right.”

Sarah pressed on. “And then, what, fifteen years ago after everyone had more or less agreed it was just an old urban legend, the town starts hearing about a company that’s routinely pouring salt around a house in the middle of the woods.”

“More like ten years ago I think” May said. “I remember hearing about it for the first time. It scared the hell out of me.”

Sarah opened her mouth to ask another question, but May cut in first.

“Did you ever go out there and kick the salt circle?” May asked, smiling.

“No. Definitely not,” Sarah replied immediately. “Did you?”

“No,” May said, then hesitated. “But I always wanted to see it. I just never worked up the nerve to actually go.”

Sarah nodded, then flipped to a fresh page in her notebook. “Okay. So then the house and a large chunk of the surrounding woods catch fire. No clear cause. Something like a hundred acres burned.”

“My dad is convinced it was the development company,” May said. “He says after twenty years of stalled plans they finally got tired of fighting and decided to clear the land themselves. Figured people would stop defending the woods if there weren’t any left.”

“That feels like a stretch,” Sarah said.

“You’re right,” May replied dryly. “It’s much more reasonable that a witch escaped and burned everything to the ground.”

Sarah rolled her eyes but kept writing. “The house burned down last year, right?”

“Yeah,” May said, her voice quieter this time. “And that’s when Hutch died” She added

“Well,” Sarah said, continuing to write, her pen slowing slightly. “He was never found, but he is presumed dead I think.”

May leaned back and stared into her coffee for a moment. “Who do you think posted his journal online?” she asked. “Do you actually believe it was his?”

Sarah hesitated. The café was quiet enough that the scrape of her pen against the paper sounded louder than it should have. “I honestly have no idea,” she said. “It reads like something someone would fake, but there are parts that feel too specific. Too personal.”

“Like he wasn’t writing for anyone else,” May said softly.

“Exactly,” Sarah replied. “And if someone else found it, why post it at all? Why not turn it over to the police, or the family, or anyone?”

May frowned. “What if it was Murph”.

Sarah stopped writing. “The supervisor guy”

“Yeah” May said. “Think about it. Hutch writes about him a lot. Not in a bad way either. He says Murph respected the town. Respected how hard people fought to keep the woods from getting bulldozed.”

“That doesn’t mean he posted the journal” Sarah said, though she did not sound convinced.

“No but it gives him a motive” May replied. “The company stalls for years. Everyone fights them. Then suddenly the woods burn. The house burns. Hutch disappears. And somehow his journal ends up online.”

Sarah frowned. “You think Murph took it”

“I think Murph might have been the only one who could” May said. “He had access. He knew Hutch was writing everything down. And if the company really did burn the land to force development through…” She trailed off.

“…then posting the journal would be a way to make sure people never forgot” Sarah finished.

“Or a way to make sure no one ever touched that land again” May added. “You read the comments when the journal first went up. People were terrified. Urban explorers started showing up. Forums blew up. The place became a hive of activity.”

Sarah slowly nodded. “Hutch did say Murph respected the townspeople. He understood why people wanted to protect the woods.”

“Exactly” May said. “Burn the land and take Hutch with it, and Murph makes sure the story survives. Not just the fire. Not just the disappearance. The witch. The salt. The house. All of it.”

Sarah looked back down at her notes. “So either Murph exposed everything out of spite” she said, “or he was trying to warn people.”

Sarah wrote down their discussion, but something didn’t sit right with her. The company’s desire to finally clear the land for development was one thing, but including Hutch in the story seemed unnecessary. Maybe he was just an unfortunate byproduct, she thought, but she wasn’t fully convinced.

“Were you able to actually find out who Murph or John were?” Sarah asked.

“Not even close,” May replied.

“Yeah, we might have some luck tracking down Murph, but there’s no way we can figure out who John really was. Hutch never even met him,” Sarah explained.

“Well, he went to meet him at the house at the end of his journal,” May said confidently.

“That wasn’t John, May,” Sarah said firmly.

“What?” May exclaimed. “Then who was it?”

“The witch,” Sarah whispered, leaning in slightly, as if she feared someone might overhear.

“Do you actually believe the witch is real, Sarah?” May asked, her tone skeptical but curious.

“Do you not?” Sarah shot back, her eyes narrowing.

May was taken aback. She had always enjoyed the creepy lore and the folktale atmosphere of the journal, but she believed that Hutch’s story was ultimately about a conspiracy and a company willing to do anything to move forward with their development plans. Meanwhile, Sarah was certain that the witch was real. In her mind, Hutch had been lured to the house by the witch herself, who had taken on the guise of John. She believed he had unknowingly broken the very barrier that had kept the witch dormant for centuries, and that the dark consequences he faced were the result of crossing a force far older and far more malevolent than any human adversary.

“Shall we read through the journal again and highlight any inconsistencies?” Sarah asked, breaking the short, tense silence that had settled between them.

“Why don’t we just go there,” May said sharply, her tone leaving no room for argument.

“Go to the house?” Sarah exclaimed, her eyes wide. “Surely there would be tons of security.”

“Yeah, maybe at the front gate, but I’m not suggesting we go in through the front,” May replied, a spark of determination in her voice.

“Is it still a crime scene?” Sarah asked, hoping the thought of legal trouble might slow May down a little.

“I think this is our logical next step,” May said bluntly. “We’ve gotten nowhere trying to track down the coffee shop he went to, it’s definitely not the one we’re in now” She said in reference to an awkward conversation they had with the barista when the entered the Café “ We have no idea who Murph is, no idea who John is, and we’ve gotten nowhere with the company.”

Sarah hesitated, then added, “We did find that obituary online that listed one of the guys’ professions as a salt tender.”

“That could just mean he laid down salt in the winter, Sarah” May said, shrugging slightly, though her eyes gleamed with purpose. “We should go check it out. No more waiting. It’s time to see it for ourselves.”

They agreed to go to Salt House in person the following day, though the decision settled very differently on Sarah than it did on May. The more Sarah researched the place, the more it felt less like an investigation and more like an invitation she had already accepted without realizing it. Every detail she uncovered seemed to pull her a little closer, as if learning about Salt House was not a passive act but something that noticed her in return. There was an uncomfortable sense that by digging into the story she was not uncovering history, but instead falling for some supernatural bait that was luring her towards a terrible end.

Sarah woke at 2:30 a.m. without warning. There had been no dream, no noise to jolt her awake, just a sudden and complete awareness of the dark. The house was silent in that way only sleeping homes can be, heavy and unmoving. Sleep refused to return. Her thoughts kept circling back to the journal, to Simon Hutchinson’s final entries, to what his last moments might have been like inside that house. The thought lodged itself in her chest and would not let go.

Sarah was twenty, the same age as May, and like May she still lived with her parents. Their house was typical for the area, modest in size but surrounded by land. Nearly forty acres stretched out behind it, dissolving into thick woods that no one really used anymore. She sat up in bed and stared out the rear window, letting her eyes adjust to the darkness.

That was when she saw the light.

It was faint at first, almost easy to dismiss, a pale glow tucked deep among the trees. Her first instinct was to ignore it. There was nothing back there. No roads, no structures, nothing but forest. But the longer she stared, the more the shape resolved itself. The light was not round or scattered like a reflection. It was sharp. Square. A window.

Sarah’s breath caught as the realization settled in. The trees beyond her window did not shift or sway. There was no wind, no rustling leaves, no movement at all. The light did not flicker or pulse. It simply existed, steady and deliberate, as if it had always been there and she was only just now being permitted to notice it. The longer she stared, the more it felt like the light was not illuminating the darkness so much as pressing against it.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand, the sudden vibration making her flinch.

Hey are you awake.  
The text was from May.

Sarah’s eyes snapped back to the window. The light was gone. The trees were dark again, a solid wall of black. She blinked hard and rubbed her eyes, her heart still pounding. Maybe she had been half asleep. Maybe her mind was filling in shapes that were not really there. She typed back a single word.

Yes.

Her phone rang almost immediately. She answered it without thinking and whispered, “May, everything ok?”

“I’m fine,” May replied, her voice low and tense, matching Sarah’s tone. “I just had the craziest dream.”

Sarah sat very still as May spoke. She described walking through the woods toward a house with only one window lit. Every other window was completely black, like empty sockets, but that one square of light glowed unnaturally bright. In the dream she kept walking closer, step by step, until she was maybe twenty feet away. That was when the light began to flicker. Just faintly at first. Then it went out completely.

May paused for a moment before continuing. She said she stood there staring at the dark window, waiting for her eyes to adjust. Slowly, a shape began to form inside. A silhouette that felt wrong somehow. As if it had been there the entire time, watching her, waiting for her to be close enough to see it.

“And then I woke up,” May said quietly. “It freaked me out so bad I had to call you.”

Sarah swallowed hard. She considered telling May about the light she had seen outside her own window, about how real it had looked, how impossible it was. But the words caught in her throat. Saying it out loud felt like making it real. Instead she forced a small laugh that did not sound convincing even to her.

“Do you think,” Sarah said carefully, “that maybe we should hold off on visiting the house tomorrow?”

There was a brief pause on the line. Then May scoffed.

“Hell no,” she said. “Eight am on the dot. I’ll be there. You’re not going to bail on me, right?”

“No,” Sarah replied, though the word felt heavy. “I’ll be there.”

“You better be,” May said, trying to sound playful. “If you’re not there, I’m going in alone.”

“I’ll be there,” Sarah said again, managing a small smile that May could not see.

They hung up a moment later. Sarah sat in the dark for a long time before finally glancing at her alarm clock. The red numbers glowed softly.

2:42 am.

She lay back down, fully expecting sleep to be impossible, but it came quickly and without warning, like being pulled under water.

When Sarah woke again, sunlight filled her room. She sat up abruptly, a sharp feeling of panic blooming in her chest. Her eyes went straight to the clock.

9:18 am.

For a moment she did not move at all. Then the dread set in, slow and absolute. She was already too late.

Sarah called May again and again while driving toward the site, each unanswered call made her chest feel slightly tighter. She told herself that May had probably been stopped by security or turned around at the gate but that thought died the moment she reached the pull off.

The gates were wide open.

The heavy chain that once sealed them lay coiled in the dirt like something discarded in a hurry. Signs promising future development still hung crookedly from the fencing, their bright colors faded and blistered by heat. Sarah and May had driven past this place more times than either of them could count, always slowing, always staring, never once daring to touch the gate. Now it stood open as if inviting her in.

Sarah drove through.

Trees closed in on her almost immediately, their blackened trunks leaning inward, crowding the road. The air grew thick and gritty, and then just as suddenly the forest fell away. The land opened into a vast hollow, a dead canvas carved out of the woods. Trees stood at the perimeter like a burned audience, while the interior was nothing but ash and ruin. The ground was scorched and uneven, littered with collapsed trunks and charcoal debris. It looked like something had been scooped out of the earth and never put back.

She slowed when she saw the concrete slab.

This had to be it HQ she thought. What remained of it was surrounded by warped piping, cracked ceramic, and half melted fixtures that had resisted the fire longer than everything else. The house came into view beyond it, and Sarah felt her stomach drop.

It was still standing.

The structure looked like it had been dipped in soot. Jet black and skeletal, its walls bowed and uneven, its windows empty. It no longer looked like a house so much as the idea of one, a crooked outline refusing to collapse. Fine particulates hung in the air, and a heavy fog pressed low against the ground, dark and unmoving. It was not even ten in the morning, but the light here felt like ten at night. Even the sun did not wish to visit this place.

May’s car was nowhere to be seen.

Sarah stepped out of her vehicle and immediately began to cough. The air burned her lungs. It was thin and suffocating, like she was breathing at the top of a mountain. Her hand stayed on the open car door as she shouted May’s name. Then screamed it. The sound was swallowed almost instantly, smothered by the fog and the dead space around her.

“May it’s me,” she called, her voice breaking. “It’s Sarah. Are you in there?”

Her mind betrayed her. Images rose of a burned figure twisting in agony. Skin split and blackened. A body that refused to die. Hung. Burned. Thrown screaming into a dry well. Sarah found herself hoping she would hear nothing, more than that she prayed that May had never made it this far.

Then a voice answered.

“Sarah.”

It was faint. Strained. Barely carried on the wind.

Sarah froze.

“May?” she shouted. “Is that you?”

“Yes,” the voice came back. “It’s me, Sarah. It’s May.”

The wind picked up suddenly, whistling through the empty windows of the house, tearing at the fog. The voice grew harder to hear, stretched thin like it was being pulled through something narrow. Tears blurred Sarah’s vision as she shouted again.

“Where are you?”

There was a pause. Just long enough to feel intentional.

“I need help,” the voice said. “I’m stuck.”

Sarah’s blood turned cold.

Stuck.

The word echoed in her head, colliding with the pages of the journal she had read and reread. John had said the same thing. Hutch had written it down. The pattern was far too familiar.

The voice came again, calmer now. Flat. It didn’t sound robotic as much as it sounded rehearsed.

“I fell down the stairs.”

Sarah felt bile rise in her throat.

She could not do this. She could not become the next line in the timeline they had been building. The next name spoken in past tense. Without thinking she slammed the car door shut, hands shaking as she fumbled with the ignition. The engine roared to life and she sped back down the road, gravel spraying behind her.

The wind battered the car as she drove, rocking it hard enough to make her swerve. And over it all, she swore she could hear screaming. Not carried by the wind, but woven into it, stretched and distorted, as if the land itself were crying out.

She did not stop until she reached the main road.

With trembling hands Sarah called May again. No answer. She called again. Still nothing.

Finally Sarah gave up and called the police.

It took days of questioning, though in Sarah’s memory it stretched and felt almost endless, as if time itself had been burned. She sat beneath buzzing fluorescent lights, repeating the same sentences to different faces, trying to explain why she had fled from the sound of her best friend crying out for help. Saying the words out loud made them sound absurd even to her. A witch. An imitation. A voice that was perfect and wrong at the same time. She watched the officers exchange glances, their pens slowing, their questions softening in a way that felt worse than accusation.

They told her they searched the property. Sarah nodded, but she did not believe them. She had been pulled away as soon as they arrived, guided gently but firmly away. never allowed to see what they saw. When she asked if anyone went inside the house, they said a hazmat team entered the following day and found nothing but the burned shell everyone already knew about. No stairs. No body. No sign that anyone had ever called out her name. The answer felt polished.

She spoke to May’s family more times than she could count, sitting at their kitchen table, answering the same questions she asked herself every night. She explained the journal, the research, the house, the theory that now sounded like madness in daylight. A missing persons case was opened, one of many that year, another name added to a growing list. Sarah searched anyway. She organized. She spoke. She drove back roads and hiked tree lines all to no avail. Years passed, but the memory of the last conversation she had with May never dulled. What if it really had been her. What if fear of a story had cost her best friend her own life.

The world continued in the way it always does, indifferent and relentless. Sarah grew older. She had children, May, James and Danny. For a while the past stayed where it belonged. Then, every so often, she would wake at 2:30 in the morning for no reason at all, her heart already racing before her eyes opened. She would sit up in bed and look out into the dark, and somewhere far beyond her yard, beyond the trees, a single square of light would be waiting.

At first she told herself it was exhaustion or stress. But the light never flickered. It never waivered. It simply was and as the years wore on the light took something from Sarah every time she saw it. She felt something inside her thinning, drying out, turning brittle. Memory and guilt and fear hollowed her slowly, patiently, until one morning she realized her mind felt exactly like that house in the woods. Burned hollow. Twisted. Standing only because it had not yet learned how to fall.",1,1766980625.0,u_VnhedoniV,0,1.0,False

1pybukn,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingfeedback/comments/1pybukn/feedback_please_chapter_1_pride/,Feedback please! Chapter 1 Pride.,"Elias was twenty-five when the house found him, which felt old enough to know better and young enough to believe cheap rent could save him.
The realtor didn’t walk him inside. She stayed on the porch, keys sweating in her palm, eyes skittering toward the windows as if the house might look back. “It’s been… vacant,” she said, and slid the keys across like a confession.
Elias nodded. Vacant sounded merciful.
He had learned, overseas, that places could hold their breath. That buildings remembered men who screamed in them. This house did neither. It exhaled when he crossed the threshold, a long, tired sound that settled into his bones.
Seven doors. He counted without meaning to. A habit. You count what you might lose.
The living room smelled of old wood and rain. Sunlight came through the windows in pale stripes, illuminating dust like snow caught mid-fall. Elias set his duffel down and stood there, hands loose at his sides, waiting for something to happen. It never did. Silence had weight; he’d worn it before.
At night, the dreams came anyway.
They always did.
—
He woke with his jaw clenched so tight it ached. Morning light pressed against the curtains. For a moment he didn’t know where he was, just that he was alive and that felt like an accusation.
He swung his legs off the bed and froze.
Someone stood in the doorway.
The man was dressed too well for the house—tailored jacket, polished shoes, posture like a blade. He looked carved rather than born. His smile was small and precise.
“Relax,” the man said. “If I wanted you dead, you wouldn’t have woken up.”
Elias’s hand moved on instinct, reaching for a weapon that wasn’t there. His pulse thundered, hot and immediate. “Who the hell are you?”
The man glanced down at Elias’s bare feet, the cluttered room, the slumped shoulders. Disapproval flickered—and then softened into something like pity.
“Pride,” he said. “And you’re wasting yourself.”
—
Pride didn’t announce himself again. He simply existed.
He corrected Elias’s posture while he brushed his teeth, nudging his shoulders back with two fingers. “You learned to stand tall once,” Pride said mildly. “You can remember.”
He chose Elias’s clothes with ruthless efficiency. No logos. No apologies. When Elias protested, Pride raised a brow. “Do you want to disappear, or do you want to be seen?”
At the coffee shop, Pride spoke quietly into Elias’s ear. “Look up.”
Elias did. The barista met his eyes. Smiled. Pride hummed approval.
At work—temporary, dead-end, exactly what Elias thought he deserved—Pride leaned against a filing cabinet and watched him answer questions without flinching. “Stop shrinking your sentences,” Pride murmured. “Say what you mean.”
Elias went home with a raise he hadn’t asked for and a strange, buzzing warmth in his chest.
—
The house changed as Pride settled in.
Mirrors appeared where there had been none. In hallways. Over sinks. Elias caught himself in them at odd angles—jaw set, eyes sharper than he remembered. Pride lingered near the reflections, adjusting a cuff, smoothing a collar that wasn’t wrinkled.
“You’re not broken,” Pride said one evening as Elias stared too long at his own face. “You were bent by something enormous. There’s a difference.”
Elias swallowed. The words lodged somewhere dangerous.
—
It felt good. That was the problem.
Confidence arrived like a drug with no immediate side effects. Elias spoke up. People listened. He slept better. He stopped apologizing for taking up space.
Pride watched it all with quiet satisfaction.
“You see?” Pride said. “You don’t need them to define you.”
Them lingered between them like smoke. The men Elias had buried. The ones who didn’t make it back.
“They were better than me,” Elias said once, the words raw. “Stronger.”
Pride’s smile tightened. “Were they?”
—
The first crack came subtly.
A coworker took credit for Elias’s work. Elias corrected him. Publicly. Sharply. Pride’s hand rested on Elias’s shoulder, warm and approving.
“Well done,” Pride said.
The room went quiet. Eyes slid away.
Elias felt taller—and strangely alone.
—
That night, Elias dreamed of standing on a ridge, wind tearing at him, his unit below like scattered shadows. Pride stood beside him, coat snapping in the gale.
“You survived because you were meant to,” Pride said.
Elias woke shaking.
—
“You’re lying,” Elias said the next morning.
Pride didn’t deny it. He rarely did. “I’m helping,” Pride replied. “Truth is flexible when it needs to be.”
Elias stared at the mirror. The man looking back stood straight, eyes bright—but something hard had crept in around the edges.
“How do I turn you off?” Elias asked.
Pride’s reflection smiled back at him. “Why would you want to?”
—
The mornings grew earlier. Elias woke before the sun, his chest humming with energy that felt foreign. Pride had him standing straighter, moving sharper, speaking sharper. Every mirror reflected a version of him that seemed to have stepped out of someone else’s life, a man polished, unyielding, untouchable.
But with every approval came a ripple Elias couldn’t shake. At lunch, he corrected the cashier for a trivial error and caught himself enjoying the shame it caused her. Pride’s hand hovered, approving yet distant. “Control is recognition,” Pride murmured.
The coworkers avoided him. He noticed it but ignored the ache. Pride whispered, “They are beneath you,” and the words slid inside like a cool, addictive drink.
By the end of the week, Elias caught himself rehearsing his smile before he entered rooms. He demanded attention without thinking. Pride didn’t push, didn’t speak—just lingered, a presence that draped him in silk and steel.
But the house whispered differently. Doors creaked in halls he hadn’t walked. Floorboards groaned under steps that weren’t his. Mirrors reflected shapes that shouldn’t be there. Elias felt the first prickling of doubt—an itch that Pride’s reassurances couldn’t quite scratch.
“You’re better,” Pride said, standing behind him as he watched the reflection of a neighbor flinch at his stare. “Stronger. Seen. Untouchable.”
Elias tried to argue, but the words tangled in his throat. He felt the warmth of power, and yet something small inside him recoiled. That whisper—the one that spoke of those he’d lost, of nights spent trembling under the weight of ghosts—wasn’t gone. Pride ignored it, or maybe simply couldn’t hear.
That night, Elias dreamt he was back overseas. The men were there, but he could not reach them. Pride stood beside him, the wind tearing at their coats, and the words came again: “You survived because you were meant to.”
But this time, Elias looked into Pride’s face and saw the gleam he hadn’t noticed before: not approval, not guidance, but hunger.

I was just about to take a sip of the milk Ethan handed me when, out of nowhere, my phone started ringing. 

The caller said. “Don’t drink it. It’s been drugged” 

My hand trembled so hard that I nearly spilled the milk 

The voice on the other end sounded frantic. 

The caller said. “We only have half a minute to talk. so listen carefully. 

This is Melissa. I’m calling from tomorrow. Right now, I’m at your funeral. 

“At 3 AM. your husband is going to throw you off the balcony while you’re asleep. You’ll die from the fall” 

I froze, instinctively glancing at Ethan, who seemed so caring and gentle. I couldn’t believe what I heard. 

The voice on the other end continued, speaking slowly and clearly. 

She said. “If you don’t believe me, check his secret WhatsApp account. He’s been seeing another woman behind your back for a long time. 

“His whole plan is to set you up to die in an ‘accident‘ during this honeymoon. 

“Listen, if you want to live, don’t let your guard down. You have to find me before 3 AM. I’ll keep you safe.” 

Then the call abruptly cut off. 

I was totally baffled. Melissa was my best friend, and she was fast asleep in the next room. 

How could she have called me with something so bizarre? 

I tried calling back, but the number was invalid. 

Ethan came out of the kitchen, flashing me a warm smile as he nudged me. 

He said, “What’s wrong, babe? Hurry up and drink your milk before it gets cold.” 

Staring at Ethan’s gentle smile, I couldn’t shake off this uneasy feeling creeping up inside me. 

Even if I wanted to dismiss that call as a sick joke, I couldn’t ignore it. Not when my life was on the line. 

I made up some random excuse, set the milk aside, and headed to Melissa’s room, phone in hand. 

But when I confronted Melissa, she just shook her head and denied everything. 

“What are you even talking about? It’s pouring outside, and the signal’s dead. I couldn’t have called you even if I wanted to,” Melissa said.

Sure enough, when I checked my phone, I had zero bars. 

I was utterly bewildered: what was that phone call I’d just received? 

I heard that voice loud and clear. It was unmistakably Melissa. 

Could it really have been Melissa from the future calling me? 

Just replaying her words in my mind made my skin crawl. 

Ethan was busy in the kitchen, and his phone was just sitting there on the coffee table. 

Luckily, Ethan never bothered to lock his phone around me, so I unlocked it in no time.

When I saw the messages from the insurance agent on his WhatsApp, the hairs on my arms stood on end. 

Ethan had actually taken out an accidental death insurance policy on me just before our honeymoon. And he was listed as the sole beneficiary. 

I clutched my chest, my heart pounding out of control. I tried to convince myself that it had to be just a coincidence. 

But when I switched over to his secret WhatsApp account, the only contact listed there made my blood run cold. 

It was a contact with no name, just a girl’s profile pic. The chat was packed with her own private selfies and a flood of angry questions. 

She texted: \[When are you finally going to divorce her? 

\[Ethan, could you kill her? That way, you’d be mine forever.\] 

The more I scrolled, the more my hands trembled. 

Suddenly, a cold voice rang out behind me. 

Ethan asked, “Honey, what are you looking at?” 

I instinctively shook my head and hurriedly closed everything on the phone, trying to make it look untouched. 

I said, “It’s nothing, really. My phone just lost signal, so I wanted to check if yours was acting up too.” 

Ethan’s cold demeanor eased a bit, and he gave me a faint smile. 

He said, “That makes sense. It’s probably just the storm messing with the signal. It should be back to normal once the rain clears up tomorrow. 

“Don’t overthink it. Come on. Have some fruit, honey.” He brought over a plate of sliced fruit. 

I forced a smile, reaching for a piece of fruit, ready to eat it.

But I stopped myself and set it back down.

If Ethan really had been trying to kill me while I slept, then my not drinking the milk meant he definitely would have tried to drug me with something else. 

I checked the time. 

It was 11 PM. There were five hours to go until 3 AM. 

As long as I stayed close to Melissa until then, I should be safe. 

I managed a weak smile. 

I said, “Honey, my stomach doesn’t feel so good. I think I’ll skip the fruit tonight. I’ll sleep in Melissa’s room, okay?” 

“No way,” Ethan shot back. 

Ethan, who never said no to me before, was suddenly weirdly firm. 

I was stunned, totally at a loss for words. 

Just then, Melissa came out of her room, looking like she was about to watch a show. She said, “Are you two fighting? 

“Listen up, Ethan. Laura’s my bestie, and if you even think about messing with her, my fists will have something to say about it.” 

Melissa was a sports school grad, always loud and straightforward. 

Hearing her, I instantly felt a bit safer and quickly shot Melissa a desperate, secret look, hoping she’d pick up on my silent plea. 

Melissa got the message instantly and jumped in, saying I should sleep in her room with her. 

Ethan’s face darkened as he gave Melissa a look I couldn’t quite figure out, then glanced at me. He still wouldn’t back down. 

He insisted, “No way. Laura’s with me tonight. 

“We’re newlyweds. This is our honeymoon. Having you here as a third wheel is already pushing it.” 

Melissa never liked Ethan. She always thought he was sketchy. 

Since this honeymoon was happening abroad, she only came along because she was worried I might get into trouble. 

But after Ethan said that, Melissa had no choice but to back off.

She said. “If you don’t believe me, check his secret WhatsApp account. He’s been seeing another woman behind your back for a long time. 

“His whole plan is to set you up to die in an ‘accident‘ during this honeymoon. 

“Listen, if you want to live, don’t let your guard down. You have to find me before 3 AM. I’ll keep you safe.” 

Then the call abruptly cut off. 

I was totally baffled. Melissa was my best friend, and she was fast asleep in the next room. 

How could she have called me with something so bizarre? 

I tried calling back, but the number was invalid. 

Ethan came out of the kitchen, flashing me a warm smile as he nudged me. 

He said, “What’s wrong, babe? Hurry up and drink your milk before it gets cold.” 

Staring at Ethan’s gentle smile, I couldn’t shake off this uneasy feeling creeping up inside me. 

Even if I wanted to dismiss that call as a sick joke, I couldn’t ignore it. Not when my life was on the line. 

I made up some random excuse, set the milk aside, and headed to Melissa’s room, phone in hand. 

But when I confronted Melissa, she just shook her head and denied everything. 

“What are you even talking about? It’s pouring outside, and the signal’s dead. I couldn’t have called you even if I wanted to,” Melissa said.

Could it really have been Melissa from the future calling me? 

Just replaying her words in my mind made my skin crawl. 

Ethan was busy in the kitchen, and his phone was just sitting there on the coffee table. 

Luckily, Ethan never bothered to lock his phone around me, so I unlocked it in no time.

When I saw the messages from the insurance agent on his WhatsApp, the hairs on my arms stood on end. 

Ethan had actually taken out an accidental death insurance policy on me just before our honeymoon. And he was listed as the sole beneficiary. 

I clutched my chest, my heart pounding out of control. I tried to convince myself that it had to be just a coincidence. 

But when I switched over to his secret WhatsApp account, the only contact listed there made my blood run cold. 

It was a contact with no name, just a girl’s profile pic. The chat was packed with her own private selfies and a flood of angry questions. 

She texted: \[When are you finally going to divorce her? 

\[Ethan, could you kill her? That way, you’d be mine forever.\] 

The more I scrolled, the more my hands trembled. 

Suddenly, a cold voice rang out behind me. 

Ethan asked, “Honey, what are you looking at?” 

I instinctively shook my head and hurriedly closed everything on the phone, trying to make it look untouched. 

I said, “It’s nothing, really. My phone just lost signal, so I wanted to check if yours was acting up too.” 

Ethan’s cold demeanor eased a bit, and he gave me a faint smile. 

He said, “That makes sense. It’s probably just the storm messing with the signal. It should be back to normal once the rain clears up tomorrow. 

“Don’t overthink it. Come on. Have some fruit, honey.” He brought over a plate of sliced fruit. 

I forced a smile, reaching for a piece of fruit, ready to eat it.

If Ethan really had been trying to kill me while I slept, then my not drinking the milk meant he definitely would have tried to drug me with something else. 

I checked the time. 

It was 11 PM. There were five hours to go until 3 AM. 

As long as I stayed close to Melissa until then, I should be safe. 

I managed a weak smile. 

I said, “Honey, my stomach doesn’t feel so good. I think I’ll skip the fruit tonight. I’ll sleep in Melissa’s room, okay?” 

“No way,” Ethan shot back. 

Ethan, who never said no to me before, was suddenly weirdly firm. 

I was stunned, totally at a loss for words. 

Just then, Melissa came out of her room, looking like she was about to watch a show. She said, “Are you two fighting? 

“Listen up, Ethan. Laura’s my bestie, and if you even think about messing with her, my fists will have something to say about it.” 

Melissa was a sports school grad, always loud and straightforward. 

Hearing her, I instantly felt a bit safer and quickly shot Melissa a desperate, secret look, hoping she’d pick up on my silent plea. 

Melissa got the message instantly and jumped in, saying I should sleep in her room with her. 

Ethan’s face darkened as he gave Melissa a look I couldn’t quite figure out, then glanced at me. He still wouldn’t back down. 

He insisted, “No way. Laura’s with me tonight. 

“We’re newlyweds. This is our honeymoon. Having you here as a third wheel is already pushing it.” 

Melissa never liked Ethan. She always thought he was sketchy. 

Since this honeymoon was happening abroad, she only came along because she was worried I might get into trouble. 

But after Ethan said that, Melissa had no choice but to back off.

I was just about to take a sip of the milk Ethan handed me when, out of nowhere, my phone started ringing. 

The caller said. “Don’t drink it. It’s been drugged” 

My hand trembled so hard that I nearly spilled the milk 

The voice on the other end sounded frantic. 

The caller said. “We only have half a minute to talk. so listen carefully. 

This is Melissa. I’m calling from tomorrow. Right now, I’m at your funeral. 

“At 3 AM. your husband is going to throw you off the balcony while you’re asleep. You’ll die from the fall”

Extreme chest discomfort, GI clear, Cardio clear, suicidal.

Basically this whole issue started in May 2025. I was having a coffee at work and started to get chest pains and tachycardia (pretty normal). I went home, tried to lie down and the chest pains worsened. Went to hospital and they were like yeah you're fine just brush is off.  

Fast forward a couple months, the chest pain was constantly there and especially bad when I lie down and try to sleep. This is my primary issue. 

I also started to get light headed and felt like I was gonna pass out grocery shopping multiple times. 

I had a few random weeks where I felt it completely dissipated.

The other issue I had was when eating (particularly a large meal) my chest discomfort would flare up & it would be hard focus. 

Sometimes I would randomly feel hot and get sweats from the stress. 

Weird symptom but I get impatient and irritable at traffic lights.

Then the culmination was that in December the chest discomfort got REALLY bad, I could focus & this was really demoralising because I had a gastro and colonoscopy that was clear. Barium swallow that was clear.  

I felt like I constantly had to keep moving otherwise I'm in constant discomfort. 

And now I've had to come off work for 2 weeks cancel Christmas plans, barely had an appetite, ive lost 8kg. 

The only thing that helps ease my symptoms is alcohol & I know that's not healthy. 

My primary suspicion is that it's a mild form of Akathisia from taking 25mg of quetiapine for about 5 years. Which I bumped up to 50mg in November (could explain why symptoms got worse. 

My GI specialist basically wrote me off saying it's something functional there's nothing wrong, which sent me over the edge.  

I definitely think there's some sort of ANS dysfunction, like im stuck in fight or flight mode. 

I have been suicidal over this for a little while now, as doctors have not been any help & I just need another opinion. 

I am off the quetiapine for about 2 weeks now.

I was still doing 12in12 in my own time because it was just a great way for me to get to games that I actually want to play in my backlog. So here was my list for 2025 along with my current feeling and rating of each game. The list is ordered chronically based on when I played them from earliest to latest.

**The Rise of the Golden Idol** \- 2024 - PC - Puzzle

* Love the first game, The Case of the Golden Idol. The sequel is more of that but in a different time period (1970s) and theme. I think the 70s time period is more interesting and the characters are more memorable. And it really helps that each case does not have to revolve around a death. 
* 5/5 stars

**UFO 50** \- 2024 - PC - Misc

* I love the idea of creating 50 games to make up the history of a non-existence console. Playing this game feels like finding a box of games at a yard sale and slowly trying a taste of them before committing to a game. I did not finish but I so want to finish all 50 games. Party House is my favorite.
* 5/5 stars 

**The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom** \- 2024 - Switch - Adventure

* I tried this game for a few hours but I didn’t get hooked. And that is disappointing because I love the idea of Zelda as the protagonist and solving problems using her wisdom. Maybe I will try again later; maybe I wasn’t in the mood. 
* Unfinished

**Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom** \- 2024 - PC - Platformer

* I love Nintendo 64 collectathon platformers which this game takes a lot of inspiration from. The game nails the retro graphic and goofy humor. But it also has its own oft-kilter vibe that I like. Most importantly, the movement is amazing. All good platformers such as Nintendo games, A Hat in Time, Demon Turf, etc have amazing traversal ability.
* 5/5 stars

**Ghost of Tsushima** \- PS5 - 2020 - Action

* Someone described this to me as Assassin’s Creed in Japan (was told this before Ubisoft actually made Assassin’s Creed Shadows) and yeah, that description fits. I love running across the world and doing a bunch of goals and moments. Tsushima is such a cinematic-looking landscape. Both combat and stealth feels good. Between the two, I am a fan of silently taking enemies out from the shadows. The story about using dishonorable guerilla tactics before ninjutsu became a thing and that is an interesting time period and dilemma.
* 5/5 stars

**Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales** \- PS5 - 2020 - Action

* I love the first Marvel’s Spider-Man; it is just fun to swing around and combat feels good. This is just more of that. Even the story feels like a retread of that which is disappointing to me that they didn’t make it more narratively unique. I do like the characters such as Miles, sidekick Ganke, and the main villain, The Tinkerer.
* 4/5 stars 

**Marvel's Midnight Suns** \- PC - 2022 - Strategy

* I tried for an hour and I just wasn’t able to commit to this game. I love superheroes and I love strategy games. However, strategy games required a huge commitment to learn and to figure out to excel at the mechanic. I was just pulled into the other games and thus, sending this game back into my backlog.

**Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door** \- 2024 - Switch - RPG

* I love the original even though I didn’t beat it so the remake was like a second chance to fulfill my goal. I enjoy it even though I did not become obsessed like I did with the original. I really love the companions and the world. It makes me wish there was more content about them. 
* 4/5 stars

**Pikmin 4** \- 2023 - Switch - Strategy

* Love Oatchi, good dog. He is a cute companion and so useful for strategizing and fighting. Also been a big Pikmin fan, just love exploring the world as this tiny explorer gathering treasure. Pikmin 4 helped me narrow in on the strategy aspect of Pikmin, which the game named Dandori. It does feel good to develop a plan for time management and to execute it successfully.
* 5/5 stars

**Hi-Fi Rush** \- PC - 2023 - Action

* I remember the first time that I saw a video of this game and was amazed at how much the graphic looks like a saturday morning cartoon. Finally got around to playing it and I was happy it played as good as it looks. It feels so good to play and it feels like I’m playing to the rhythm even though my in-game ratings say otherwise.
* 4/5 stars

**Shadows Over Loathing** \- Switch - 2022 - RPG

* Big fan of West of Loathing. I think West is a better experience (I think I prefer the wild west setting over the 20s prohibition setting) but Shadows still holds its own with its writing. The game is funny and the side quests are so memorable. I just want to continue exploring the world and finding quests.
* 5/5 stars

**God of War** \- PS5 - 2018 - Action

* A friend recommended this to me but I just could not find the time for it. I just didn’t prioritize it over the other action games on this list 
* Untouched



I also want to do a quick review of my gaming life in 2025. Here are my top 10 games that I played in 2025. About the labels, “12in12” are games from my 12in12 list. “Not backlog” are games that I played once I acquired them. “Backlog” are games that I didn’t touch for a long period after getting them.

Asgtia, Republic of Antares

2:30 AM Asgtia Mean Time

CDR Ashkanai Oras'nai, ARS Arethasak (F103), Convoy OA-348\*

""CAPTAIN!"" Arethasak calls out from the radar room, her systems relaying data to both the main bridge, combat information center, and the rest of the convoy's escorts - four Halsey-class and two Huron-class destroyer leaders of the UN Navy, in addition to multiple frigates. ""S-BOATS, ASTERN! 500 KILOMETERS OUT! INCOMING TORPEDOES!""

Stealth Boats, or S-boats. Small T'Chak ships equipped with rudimentary stealth fields masking subspace signatures, much like the submarines of the past. All equipped with shielded torpedoes that most CIWS falter in the face of. 

""Fifteen-torpedo spread, incoming!"" a transmission broadcasts across the bridge. it's Captain Ingham alongside Gato - one of the frigates picketing at the rear of the convoy with her gravitic sensors reports. ""Performing evasive manuevers!""

Just like the submarines from hundreds of years ago - when the final frontier was but a dream. Silent hunter-killers, almost impossible to detect via subspace radar - their subspace wakes are muffled completely - should they not fire and move slowly. 

A nightmare for any un-escorted merchant convoy, and potentially a major nuisance for even the most heavily armed destroyer - a single T9c torpedo hit can end a destroyer's naval career in an instant.

""Gravitic sensors are detecting two cloaked S-boats.""

Unfortunately, one ship - SAF Gratia, carrying coffee to Antares, is torpedoed, causing a massive explosion that tears the ship apart in an instant.

""Attacks incoming from astern! Make sure they have nowhere to hide!"" one of the human destroyer leaders - Haida, broadcasts across the convoy, causing all the human destroyers to open fire, their railguns firing shells augmented with gravitic sensors into the convoy's rear, before sailing towards the S-boat ""wolfpack"".

""ARN ships, stay close to the convoy. We'll handle the rest."" Haida's commander orders. ""Just in case they decloak in the middle of the convoy.""

While they may be threatening...

""S-boat damaged by auxiliary-caliber gunfire, continuing pursuit!"" Gleaves - one of the UN destroyers escorting, reports to the rest of the convoy.

""S-boat destroyed by main-caliber gunfire!"" Huron - the second destroyer leader, reports in. 

...they are not invincible.

And in the end...

When anyone hunts humans, they will almost always become the hunted.

And humans, being natural persistence predators, are not very keen on stopping.

1pyb99d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pyb99d/need_advice_my_ex_wants_to_get_coffee/,"Need advice, my ex wants to get coffee","He broke up with me after 5 years and I was very blindsided. We were having issues but I thought it was stuff we would get through, and he continued talking about the future like getting married and booking another Europe trip together. We had just adopted a kitten 5 months before.

I’m very conflicted. He was numb when he after he broke up, he told me he’d always love me but he was very cold about everything. I did make mistakes id gone off an SSRI that made me very irritable and stressed. I snapped at him twice and acted very immaturely. I apologized and told him I needed to go back on meds but he urged me to try and be okay without them.

I was always very honest about where I wanted him to pick up in household chores but he told me it felt like I was criticizing everything he did. He was at work like 60 hours a week by choice because he had 2 jobs he liked. I just wanted to feel more connected and spend more time with him which I think is why I always asked him to do more. And I always was planning activities and he seemed to enjoy it too but now he seems to resent me for it.

About 10 days after one of our argument he invited his parents over for dinner. We had a great evening and played games and then after they left he told me he’d was unsure of us. I was in so much shock. I went to stay with my mom for the weekend because I was so distraught and wanted to give him space. 48 hours later texting me he wished he felt different but he wasn’t sad that I was gone and he felt relieved about his decision. This broke me.

I moved my stuff out two weeks later. I asked if I could stay and we could talk and he said “it wasn’t a good idea”. He also said it felt like I was just on vacation since my stuff was still there. He claims he never made me leave but he made me feel so unwelcome so how could I stay there.

I started having very dark thoughts and it was scary. It felt like my life was over. I opened up to a friend and found a therapist so I’m okay now. I also in a vulnerable state I dumped on my ex how terrible I was doing and I regret this so much. I made sure he knew I was okay and went no contact again.

Two weeks later he messages me profusely apologizing of how sudden the breakup was and how he acted numb. He admitted he actually still does feel things for me and he was emotionally overwhelmed before and shouldn’t have trusted that. He said he’d be open to going to therapy and seeing a couples counsellor later on. He asked to meet for coffee whenever I feel ready.

I’m so conflicted. I loved him so much and begged him after the breakup to see a couples counsellor with me and he denied. But I wanted him to say these things for weeks and he didn’t and just pushed me away. And I was so traumatized by the breakup and got so depressed I was scared. I can’t forget what a dark place I was in and I know he didn’t necessarily cause this but it still happened. I’m worried if I don’t meet him for coffee now and talk about things then I’ll never be ready and I’ll wait too long. But I’m worried that seeing him now would send me into a spiral. It’s been 2 months since the breakup but I’m still traumatized with how low my mental health got.

1pyb7my,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1pyb7my/did_i_buy_a_broken_machine/,did i buy a broken machine,"so i just bought a used breville infuser off of ebay, and ive been having issues with the pressure. this has been driving me insane qs i have now spent hours trying to troubleshoot this, so im really hoping someone can tell me if this is truly a mechanical issue, and not user error or a dialing in issue.

my problem is that when brewing a shot the pressure gauge will not go past the pre infusion mark, and the shots taste terrible. i have tried so many different grind sizes and doses and this does not change. i have tested on both the dual wall and single wall baskets with the same results. i have also noticed that when a shot choked, the pressure still stayed within that range which i think is an important detail. you’d think that choking it would raise it to max pressure. but when i tried back flushing with the rubber disk the pressure actually raised to max which is confusing. 

i am using a kingrinder k2 so i know the grinder is not a problem. i have already replaced the worn gasket and have cleaned the group head and descaled. i am currently waiting on a scale to be delivered, and this seems to be the last factor that could make this user error since i was dosing by eye before (approximately a few mm below the basket rim after tamping). but i thought that the dual wall should be a lot more forgiving with grind size and dosing issues, but again i was still getting the same results with that. i have just done so many test runs (one and a half bags of coffee to be exact) that you’d think id get it right at least once. 

i’d really really appreciate any help or advice.",1,1766978610.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

Context: Maglalabas lang ako ng thoughts at nararamdaman ko kase wala akong masabihan..
Magkwento lang ako sa inyo. Okay lang ba?

So Im F,28 in a relationship with M, 30 for about 7 years na. 
Nagpropose na din naman sya sakin last year ata? Pero ayun wala naman ganap til now. I dunno kung anong purpose ng proposal na yan? 
Anyways, punta tayo sa gusto kong ishare.
May ka workmate tong bf ko na specific na babae na nacaught na ng attention ko way back 2023 pa. 
Una kong napansin is yung group photos nila sa office eh lagi silang magkatabi.
Basta every group pic magkatabi sila kaya sinita ko sya about dun. Sabi ko na baka pwede sa lalaki sya kumaibigan at di sa opposite sex.
Ako kase yung tipo na walang filter at maririnig mo talaga lahat ng nararamdaman ko pag may concern ako.
So ayun wala naman masyadong issue kase yun lang naman napansin ko halos. Casual na pang work lang naman ang usap nila sa viber so wala naman ng ibang suspish kumbaga so parang nawala nalang yung issue.

Konting backstory, etong bf ko okay naman kaso laging kapos in terms of financial.
Technically, nakatira sya sa bahay namin. Ambag nya lang is 3k a month.
As in unli use ng internet, water, electricity, shelter, at food. 3k lang ambag nya. 
Pero madalas pag lalabas kami ako lagi gagastos. Kase laging kapos.

So going back, 2024 nakita kong active na kachat nya na naman sa viber etong certain girl co worker na ito. Medyo may konting asaran sa chat.
So ngayon tinanong ko sya na ganon pala sya kaclose sa mga babae sa office nila na talagang casual nalang magasaran.
Tas syempre, as usual paramg binalewala nya lang yung concern ko hanggang sa napapansin ko nagbubura na sya ng convo sa viber.
Edi nagconfront ulit ako. Bakit sya nagbubura. Sabi nya kase nga lahat nalang daw ginagawa kong issue. 
Nabalewala na naman concern ko.
Hanggang sa hinayaan ko na.

Then recently ealier this year, napansin ko yung sudden change ng style nya sa damit. Nageeffort talaga sya bumili ng damit para okay yung outfit nya. Tas andaming skincare at naging active sa gym.


Di kase ako pala check ng socials. Nakadepende lang sa mood ko kung ichecheck ko.
Anyways, random na nagcheck ako kagabi and to my surprise nag followan sila sa IG. 
It makes sense now.
Kaya pala ang active nya na magayos sa sarili at active mag myday ng ganap nya like picture sa coffee shop na pinuntahan namin or mirror selfie nya  na di naman nya ginagawa before. Basta mga random updates sa buhay nya na para bang may iniinform sya sa kung sino man magviview ng myday nya.
I dont know if may something na ba sa kanila or what pero ayun sobrang nasaktan ako kase matagal ko ng issue yung babaeng yun at nung 2023 palang sinabihan ko na sya na ayus ayusin nya pinaggagagawa nya sa office nya. At kung pwede eh wag syang masyadong nagiging close sa babae. Dami naman pwede kaibiganin na lalaki. Bat sya pa? 

Di ako galit sa babae, kase di ko alam if yung bf ko ba yung nagpapapansin sa kanya or what diba? 
Pero sure ako na interested yung bf ko sa babaemg yun. Obvious at instinct ko.
Kaya siguro nya ako pinagtyatyagaan kase may napapala sya sakin at kapos pa sya sa pera atm.
Overthink kung overthink pero nakakabastos na kase sakin kahit small cheating pa yan. Pinapantasya nya mga bikini photos ng babaeng yun. While di nya kase makukuha sakin yun kase Im fat but  im pretty naman  (eme)
Kapal ng mukha lang talaga nya kung tutuusin  at sana umalis na lang sya if ayaw na nya sakin diba? 
May napundar na din kase kami together at hinuhulugang condo.
Ang hirap basta basta magdecide pero ayun halatadong nakikisama nalang sya sakin kase wala syang choice atm.
Kung may pera pera lang siguro to matagal na kaming hiwalay.

Previoua Attemprs: Kinausap ko na sya about this but sorry lang sinasabi nya atfou ayaw nyang umalis sa bahay namin. Ayoko sana mageskandalo at kasama ko buong pamilya ko dito. 
But ayaw nya talagang lumayas!!!

They tore down the corridor, Maren half-dragging Samuel as the sound of claws scraped the floor behind them. The flickering red lights turned the walls into a strobing nightmare.

A sign ahead flickered:
SUBLEVEL ACCESS – AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

The door beneath it was rusted and warped, a heavy security latch half-broken from months of neglect. Samuel slammed his shoulder into it.
Bang!
Bang!
The third hit broke it open, and they stumbled through into a narrow stairwell that spiraled into darkness.

Maren is panting now. “He’s not stopping!..”

“Then we keep moving!”

Above them, something struck the wall  hard. Plaster rained down as the vent along the stairwell ceiling buckled inward. The creature was in the ducts again, crawling parallel to them, tracking every step.
They descended fast, their footsteps echoing like gunfire. The lower they went, the thicker the air became.
At the bottom of the stairs, they found a reinforced door marked GENERATOR CONTROL. Samuel tried the handle. Locked.

He raised his gun, and shot the latch. The echo roared through the stairwell.
The door swung open to reveal a cavernous basement humming faintly with failing machinery. Rusted generators lined the walls, cables snaking across the floor. The red emergency lights barely reached the far end of the room.

Samuel shut the door behind them, dragging a heavy pipe across the handle to wedge it closed. Maren collapsed against the wall, trembling.

“Ohh my God, we are gonna fucking die here! This is it!"" 

Samuel grabs her shoulders ""No we will get out of this! Think really hard, what could we use against him?""

From the other side of the door came a loud  bang. Then another. The metal creaked.

Samuel stepped back, his gun raised as Maren rushed over to the generator.

“He’s gonna break through.”

Maren responds. “Let him..”

The detective frowned. Then his eyes darted upward.
The vents. A faint hiss, air shifting.
The grate above them twisted, and a long, clawed arm slid through the opening.

Samuel looks at Silv in a panic. ""Maren.. whatever you got planning.. could you maybe speed it up?!""

The lights dimmed further as one of the generators sparked out. For a moment, total darkness. Then, in a faint red dim emergency light, Silv dropped from the ceiling, landing in front of the exit.
His movements were fluid now, animalistic.

Silv straightened slowly, tilting his head, breathing deep as if tasting their fear. The sound of the generators pulsed behind him like a heartbeat.

He took a step forward.
Then another.

Samuel fired again. click.
Empty. The creature let out a wet chuckle and lunged. Samuel barely managed to shove Maren out of the way as the creature’s claws shredded through some metal pipes, sending sparks into the air. The impact rang through the generator room.

He raised a broken pipe, swinging wildly. The strike landed across Silv’s shoulder making him turn, the creature's lips peeled back into a snarl that exposed a jaw full of serrated, uneven teeth. Maren scrambled to her knees, eyes darting across the generator panels, her fingers trembled as she followed the cables to a half-scorched control box.

The hum of the machines around them was weak, dying but had just enough energy for a final push.

Maren shouts. “If I can reroute the current, the backup floodlights might still work!""

She tore open the control box with a wrench. Wires hissed and crackled. Her hands moved fast, crossing cables, ignoring the horrors behind her as heat seared her fingers.

Silv snapped his teeth into the metal pipe, pushing Samuel further into the ground. “Whatever you’re doing, do it now!”

Silv let out a roar, releasing the pipe before holding himself up to rip apart the detective, his claws outstretched.

Maren slammed the switch. The room exploded in white light. Every overhead lamp burst to life at once, flooding the sublevel with searing brightness. The sudden glare reflected off the steel walls, pure and merciless.

Silv screamed.
It wasn’t human. It was rage and agony fused into one shriek. He stumbled backward, thrashing. His tail smashed into the generators.

For the first time, Samuel saw him clearly — the jagged stitching of the grey worn out suit he wore, the unnatural blending of muscle and sinew, his foggy eyes shot in pain as he covered his eyes shut.

Samuel shouts in surprise. “The lights! He can’t handle direct exposure!”

Silv let out one last guttural hiss before he retreated, scrambling back up the wall like a reptile, tail whipping as he climbed. He slipped into the vent shaft, disappearing into the dark with a metallic screech.

The room fell silent except for the whir of the generators. Maren collapsed beside the console, breathing hard, her burned fingers trembling. Samuel dropped his weapon, staring up at the torn vent.

“You saved us.”

“No… just bought us time.”

Samuel then turned to Maren.
She sat slumped against the wall, clutching her burned hand.

“You gonna tell me what the hell that was back there?”

“I turned the lights on?.”

“Don’t play dumb with me.” He took a step closer. “You knew what would happen. You knew the lights would scare him. How come you never mentioned it?!”

She didn’t answer.

“You also knew he’d hesitate around you. He’s torn this place apart, but he didn’t lay a finger on you. He only focused on me!”

Her shoulders tensed. The faint hum of the generators filled the silence between them.

His voice grows low with suspicion. “Why? Why does he hesitate when he sees you? You claim that his traces of humanity are gone. But I see how he pauses when looking at you.”

Maren’s eyes flicked to the vent, the last place Silv’s pale eyes had glared down at her. Her voice came out as a whisper.

“Because I..”

He shouts. “Because what?!”

She slowly reached into her satchel and pulled out something small, a folded, worn piece of cloth. The faded pattern was barely visible, but even in the dim light, it was unmistakably a child’s blanket.

“This was his mother’s..”

Samuel's jaw tightened. “Where did you get that?”

“I found it years ago… when I was assigned here as his handler. His father kept it, hid it in his office. When Silv first transformed, it was the only thing that calmed him. I thought if he ever came back…”
Her voice broke off. She looked down, pressing the blanket to her chest.
“I thought maybe it could keep me alive.”

Samuel’s eyes narrowed, circling her words like a predator himself.
“You’re saying you planned this?”

“No!.” Her voice rose, trembling. “I was trying to help him. But once his father started the experiments, there was no stopping it. He said he could heal people, that Silv was a miracle..!”

Samuel interrupted. “Then why keep it for yourself! I could have been killed and you had the fucking antidote this whole time?!”

She froze, staring at him.
“I... I'm sorry..”
Maren spoke quietly, almost ashamed.

“If I hold this.. He doesn’t see me. He sees her. I don't want to die..”

The detective exhaled slowly, disgust and pity crossing his face.

“You’re using his grief as a shield.”

“You don’t understand,” she whispered. “He’s not just a monster. There’s still something of him left. Somewhere in that thing, the boy who lost his mother is still crying for her.”

His expression hardened. “And what happens when he stops remembering?”

The question hung in the air. Neither spoke.

A distant sound cuts through the silence, a clang, far above, in the vents.

The detective raised his knife again, eyes scanning the ceiling.

“We’re out of time.” He looked at Maren, his tone low and cold now.
“You’re going to show me everything you know about him, the files, the tests, the father’s research. No more secrets.”

Maren clutched the blanket tighter, her expression hollow.
“They’re in the observation wing… but if we go there, he’ll follow us.”

“Good.” He chambers a round.
“Then we’ll end this where it began.”

The emergency lights flickered in a rhythm like a heartbeat as Samuel and Maren made their way through the lower hall. The generator’s hum faded behind them, replaced by the faint creak of the asylum’s metal doors, pipes groaning, vents hissing. Every sound felt alive.

Maren rushed ahead, her burned hand pressed to the blanket tucked against her chest. Samuel kept his knife trained down the corridor.

“How far is this observation wing?”

“Just past the surgical floor. The offices should still be sealed.”

The hallway split in two. The sign above them was rusted, but still legible: Observation / Genetic Archive.

They moved toward the archive door, thick glass streaked with years of grime. The detective pushed it open with what other strength he had left. 

Inside, the air was cold and stale. Rows of metal filing cabinets stood like gravestones, their drawers warped and bent. The walls were lined with cracked screens and shelves full of tapes, labeled in the same red ink: PROJECT NIGHTCRAWLER – PHASE 1–12.

Samuel set the flashlight down and began digging through the drawers. Old reports, photos, X-rays, each one more grotesque than the last. Notes in the doctor’s scrawled handwriting covered the margins: “Metabolic collapse. Subject unresponsive.” … “Add canine sensory genome.” … “Mother’s interference continues to impede progress.”

He paused.
That last line was underlined twice.

He flipped the page. There was a transcript,  a phone log.
At the top, written in neat handwriting: “Dr. V. Halvorsen / M. Vale – private.”

He scanned the text, his brow furrowing.

Maren spoke softly. “What did you find?”

Samuel started reading the file. “Your name.”

She froze. “What?”

He turned the page around.
The words were plain as day:

“M. Vale will ensure removal of the subject’s mother during transport. Custody transfer must appear natural. The patient will adapt better without maternal interference.”

Maren’s lips parted, but no words came out.

Harlan stepped closer, his voice low and dangerous. “You killed her?”

“No… I—”

“You helped him kill her. You were the nurse on duty the night his mother died!.”

Maren shook her head violently, tears forming. “It wasn’t supposed to happen like that! He said it would be clean, that she’d just go to sleep. He told me it was mercy, that she was sick and!..”

Samuel slammed his hand against the filing cabinet, making her flinch.

“You murdered his mother so that monster could have a test subject!”

She backed away, trembling.
“I thought!. I thought if I stayed close, I could protect the boy… that I could stop him before it got too far…”

The detective's eyes burned with disgust.
“You don’t protect someone by destroying their life!.”

For a long moment, neither spoke. The hum of the asylum filled the silence again, the low, electric vibration that never stopped.

Then the lights flickered.
Once. Twice.
A vent above them rattled. The dust sifted down like ash. The overhead light burst, plunging them into darkness.

From the far end of the archive room came a slow, deliberate sound, claws dragging against metal.

Both the nurse and detective pressed forward through the maze of steel doors, the scent of mold and ash clinging to the air. Behind them, the sound of claws scraping against ductwork drew closer.

Maren calls out. “We need to keep moving,  he’ll know if we stay here.”

“You seem to know exactly what he’ll do, and don't say we. He doesn't smell YOU, he smells me!”

She didn’t answer. Her eyes darted toward the emergency stairwell, then back at the vent grating overhead that trembled slightly.

Samuel’s grip tightened on his weapon.
“You’re not telling me something. Where the fuck is the exit?!”

Maren snaps at him. “You don’t understand! I’ve been trying to keep him calm, to keep you safe!”

He cut her off. “You’ve been lying since we got here!”

They reached a cell door. Maren shoved it open, but instead of going through, she stopped and turned. Her hand slipped behind her back, fingers curling around a tranquilizer syringe hidden under her coat.

Samuel realizes. “What are you!-”

The needle sank into his neck before he could finish. He stumbled backward, the world swaying and blurring. The knife clattered to the floor, rolling in a dizzy circle. 

Maren spoke out almost tearful. “I’m sorry, Detective. But he only hunts the ones who don’t belong here.”

She shoved him through the doorway, into the padded isolation room. The same metal door she’d shown him earlier. It slammed shut behind him with a hollow clang.
He pounded on it weakly, voice slurred from the sedative.

“You’re out of your damn mind, Maren!”

Through the reinforced window, he could see her, breathing fast, her face pale and trembling.

“He won’t hurt me. He remembers my scent. His mother’s scent.”
Then the vents above him groaned. The air shifted.

Samuel’s eyes widened as something massive crawled down from the shadows, his pale skin glistening, breath rattling like a growl trapped in its throat.

The monster dropped into the room, crouched low, the tattered remains of what was once his father's grey suit from the photos clung loosely to him. 
Maren stood outside the window, clutching the blanket to her chest, watching with a trembling smile.

But then Samuel moved.
With a surge of adrenaline, he snatched the blanket from her through the narrow gap when she peeked through the viewing glass. 

Maren screams out, reaching for the blanket. “No! Give that back!”

He stumbled backward, clutching it like a lifeline. Then he dragged the filthy blanket through, throwing grime and ash onto Maren until the perfume’s soft floral trace was replaced by decay. He finally gave-way to the tranquilizer and collapsed against the wall, sliding back down. 

The creature froze mid-step. Its nostrils flared. The scent was now solely on Samuel. Slowly, its gaze turned toward the window where Maren stood, now unshielded.

Her face fell. “Silv… it’s me. It’s..it’s Maren!”

The creature’s head tilted, the muscles in its jaw twitching as if trying to remember the name. Then it screeched, a sound like metal splitting in half, and launched itself at the door.

“No— NO!”

The reinforced door broke through before the creature dragged her through the hallway thrashing her around in his jaws. Her screams echoing down the corridor before they were abruptly cut off.

Silence followed.
“Guess you finally found your justice.” he muttered under his breath before finally embarrassing the darkness. 

FBI vans idled in the overgrown driveway, emergency lights flashing across the broken windows. Samuel sat in the ambulance truck beside his supervisor Raines, both watching as teams in hazmat suits combed through the ruins of Ironwood Asylum.

Raines speaks out. “Nothing. No bodies, no signs of the nurse, no tracks. Just claw marks… and blood.”

Samuel's jaw tightened.
He didn’t answer. His eyes lingered on the shattered open gates. 

“You’re lucky to be alive, Detective. Whatever happened down there, it’s done. You hear me?”

He nodded slightly, though his gaze didn’t waver.

“Yeah. Done.”

But as the words left his mouth, a cold breeze slipped through the asylum’s entrance, whispering against the walls like a breath, making Samuel shiver. 

 Samuel's Apartment (Weeks Later)

The city’s hum outside was almost too normal. On his coffee table sat a sealed evidence box marked PROJECT NIGHTCRAWLER — returned to him after debriefing. He hadn’t opened it.

His supervisor’s voice still echoed in his head. “You’re off duty for a month. Take it. You need it.”

The apartment lights flickered once, then steadied.
Samuel sat back on his couch, staring at the reflection of the TV screen black and blank.

Last year I used 4 steel wool pads per 1 gallon of 6% vinegar as a base for my ebonizing solution. It sat for 3 months while we waited for the ground to thaw, the steel was totally dissolved at that point.

  
Because I was applying it to pine, I read that I needed to increase the tannins. I added coffee and tea directly to the vinegar for about a week and then strained & stained. The wood turned out deep brown almost black. The color has stayed true in our intense Colorado sun and I'm super happy with it.

  
I am gearing up for another project but now I'm seeing that people apply the tannins, let it dry, then the iron acetate.

  
My question is this: Did I basically make a 1 shot stain by mixing them together or did I just get really lucky with my results? Has anyone else done it like this?

1pyazoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1pyazoj/am_i_wrong_for_treating_a_news_station_tour/,Am I wrong for treating a news station tour disclaimer like a software license agreement?,"Yes, because that's exactly how I treated it.  Burner account because I don't want this tied to my main.  I took video of all that happened, but I was advised to keep it to myself for now in case any legal funny business happens.

I (43M) recently won a contest a local news station put on for a gift card by a major credit card company.  They asked me if they can mail it to me or pick it up at the news station.  I asked them if I pick it up in person, can I take a tour of the studio.  They say sure why not.  I then ask if I can do the tour while Lisa (Fake name, 30F) is there.  Lisa is one of their weather forecasters and since she was hired, the station's ratings went up.  It's easy to guess why: She is rather busty with the body of an SI swimsuit model, beautiful face and a personality that is perfect for TV.  She also revealed via her socials recently that she is single (Which I'm sure a lot of people were shocked to hear).

So anyway, I go to the station and they have me sign a disclaimer before I do the tour.  I don't read it, I just sign it (Otherwise, they wouldn't have let me do the tour).  So then I see Lisa.  We greet each other and get to talking.  Turns out, me and her have a lot in common.  I figured ""screw it"" and asked her out, basically ""I am not familiar with that type of cuisine, maybe I could take you out to one of your favorite places so I can get familiar and also get to the know the woman behind the news personality?""  She said, ""Are you asking me out on a date?""  ""I guess I am,"" I tell her with a wink.  ""Wait here,"" she tells me before walking away and disappearing.  I had a bad feeling so that's when I started recording with my phone and put it back on my holster....

....A couple of minutes later two burly looking dudes dressed in polo shirts and khakis came up to me and demanded to know if I asked Lisa out on a date.  I said yes, because like a certain basketball player once said, you miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take.  That's when one of them said ""There are some shots you should know better not to take and you have 1 minute to leave the premises otherwise we will call the police and have you arrested for trespassing.""  I asked them if I can ask one question before they start the countdown.  They sigh and say sure.....

I am not a conventionally attractive person.  But even non conventionally attractive people have the right to swing for the fences.  So I asked the guards, ""would any of this be happening if I looked like Chris Hemsworth or Ryan Reynolds?""  That's when one of the guards yells ""Alright that's it!"" before grabbing my arm and forcefully trying to lead me to the door.  I practically shout ""Get off of me!  Let me go!"" as loud as I can.  That's when Lisa came around and shouted at them to let me go.  She apologized to me, and asked the guard why he decided to go all WWE on me.  That's when he said ""he violated the disclaimer.""  She looked confused, as did me.

That's when the station manager, the guy who initially gave it to me, came over to us and told me ""Clearly you didn't read it.  It said, towards the bottom that you will not make any advances, romantic or otherwise towards the on-air talent.  I specifically told our security staff that I found it very odd that you asked to do the tour when Lisa is here and I told them that if you so much as ask her out for coffee to remove you from the building.  Your appearance has nothing to do with it.""  Yeah BS, because if it really didn't that one guard would not have reacted that way, but I choose not to say anything in response to that.

But anyway, I told the manager, ""Come on man no one reads those things before they sign it if they know refusing would get them denied the tour, it's like a software license agreement, everyone just hastily scrolls down and clicks next.  Same thing here, they just sign it.""  As for Lisa?  She actually was not offended at all and thought it was very flattering.  In fact, she said yes and we're going out to one of her favorite ethnic restaurants.  So I guess, good on me?

Of course, some people are saying that if they put the blurb of ""you can't hit on or ask out our staff"" there must have been a reason for it (Past experience, maybe?) and that I should have read it first.  Some are saying I was lucky she said yes to the date because if she \*was\* offended I could have been ""the guy"" that caused them to cancel out any future tours.  I am really wrong here?  I didn't bother reading the disclaimer because who realistically does, I shot my shot and have a date out of it!",0,1766977977.0,amiwrong,11,0.22,False

I'm 47, divorced for quite a while now, and have been single for the last three years. I have a daughter who’s currently studying at the University of Chicago. The past several years have been mostly about work and navigating some big life changes, but lately I’ve been feeling like it’s time to reach out again and build some meaningful friendships with women who are in a similar chapter.I’ve settled into a pretty low-key lifestyle these days 

My ideal weekend would be to do some relaxing morning yoga; take a walk to clear my head; drink coffee on the porch and read a good book; try some new recipes in the kitchen; or dream about my next solo trip to some quiet and beautiful place. I’m long past the late nights out, and now I’m much more drawn to calm, deep conversations and friendships that grow slowly and naturally.I’d love to find a few steady female friends to stay in touch with every now and then — sharing what we’re reading or listening to, talking about the funny or tough parts of midlife, celebrating little wins, or just being there for each other when one of us needs a kind ear. I'm especially interested in connecting with women who are also going through an empty nest phase, or who are simply enjoying this quieter, more independent phase of their lives. Online friendships work very well for me (time difference is not a problem for me at all—sometimes receiving a short message before bed is the best moment of my day)

If you happen to live near Los Angeles, that would be even better. If you’re looking for the same kind of easygoing, supportive connection, feel free to reply here or send me a message. Tell me a little about yourself — maybe something small that made you smile this week, or a book that’s grabbed you lately. I truly believe good friendships take time and care, and I’m happy to let them develop at whatever pace feels right.Looking forward to hearing from you—Toivon, että nautit joka päivästä täysin siemauksin#Finnish

We have a running joke about me doing the ""heavy lifting"" for her while she recovers from surgery.

​The Situation:
I tried to lock in Monday at 10am. She rescheduled me, saying: ""Hey one of my co workers wanted to come to the gym with me tomorrow, how about Tuesday?"" I agreed to Tuesday 10am and she sent back: ""Yes it does 😊""

​The Conflict:
My friend is telling me I'm ""screwed."" He’s convinced the coworker is another male and that she’s choosing him over me for the Monday slot. He thinks I’m being ""benched"" while she plays the field.

​The Move:
 I want to start being upfront and not like wasting time. I'm not going to sit aroundwondering where I stand. My plan for Tuesday is to finish the workout, ask her to grab coffee immediately after, and then be 100% straight with her.
​I’m planning to tell her: ""Look, you’re beautiful and I’m really into you. I’m not looking for a 'gym buddy' or to be in the friend zone."" My friend says women her age respect that kind of directness and ""leader"" energy. If she’s down, I’m moving the conversation toward getting a hotel/private spot since she lives with her mom and sisters. If she’s not, at least I didn't waste another week being her ""unpaid trainer.""

​Reddit, I need your take:
​Is my friend right that the ""coworker"" is a red flag, or is her making Tuesday a 1-on-1 a green light?
​Is being that blunt (""I don't want to be in the friend zone"") the right move for a 45-year-old woman, or is it too much too fast?

my problem is that when brewing a shot the pressure gauge will not go past the pre infusion mark, and the shots taste terrible. i have tried so many different grind sizes and doses and this does not change. i have tested on both the dual wall and single wall baskets with the same results. i have also noticed that when a shot choked, the pressure still stayed within that range which i think is an important detail. you’d think that choking it would raise it to max pressure. but when i tried back flushing with the rubber disk the pressure actually raised to max which is confusing. 

i am using a kingrinder k2 so i know the grinder is not a problem. i have already replaced the worn gasket and have cleaned the group head and descaled. i am currently waiting on a scale to be delivered, and this seems to be the last factor that could make this user error since i was dosing by eye before (approximately a few mm below the basket rim after tamping). but i thought that the dual wall should be a lot more forgiving with grind size and dosing issues, but again i was still getting the same results with that. i have just done so many test runs (one and a half bags of coffee to be exact) that you’d think id get it right at least once.

Also, since there's no wall behind the beam, I think I will need to exchange it for one with tab tension.  

As for a projector would it be best to hang it from the ceiling by the bed or can it sit on the coffee table in front of the couch?

I am open to spending up to $2K for both the projector screen and the projector. The projector screen would also need to be manual (no electrical source).  TIA for any suggestions!

Before my fantasy football playoff game this week, I made a small altar and did a few simple offerings.

I burned some tarwood first to cleanse the space, then wrote my fantasy lineup on a piece of paper and burned that too.. kind of as a way of letting go of control and trusting whatever was going to happen.

After that I made a few offerings:

Black coffee for Odin (clarity and wisdom), a bowl of fruit for Freya (abundance and good fortune), and a small obsidian weapon for Thor (strength and protection). I said a short prayer/invocation and included a few personal spiritual items that matter to me.

Nothing big or dramatic. Just intentional and respectful.

 I didn’t just win….. I ended up having the highest scoring week of any team for the entire season. Stuff went my way in a way that honestly surprised me.

I’m not saying the gods are out here managing fantasy lineups 😄 but I do think there’s something powerful about pausing, setting intention, and acknowledging forces bigger than yourself.

So whether it was coincidence, mindset, alignment, or something else… I’m grateful.

Hail Odin.
Hail Freya.
Hail Thor.

\- One Ecoflow Delta 2 max : gets charged by main power line through a voltage regulator (coz power flactuates like crazy) when power is on, it can charge really fast , but i set it to charge around 1kw, this unit powers the pcs, wife's sewing machine, lights, coffee machine, washing machine when cycle is light, i do not use it to power the fridge and the freezer we will get to those later

\- Power banks: cheap , simple, they charge your usb devices, like phones tablets etc.. i got a few to use with boost converters to power on the routers, routers can run days on decent power banks (the boost converters can be bought for cheap on aliexpress etc..)  


\-Flash lights : got a lot of them , with backup flashlights and backups for those backups.. they are cheap , so you can have a ton, and can never have enough, a good flashlight pointed at the ceiling can light up a whole room, most my flashlights run on 18650/21700 batteries , i also got some with small solar panels, but they are pretty useless during the winter, almost forgot to mention head mounted flashlights, they are very useful when you need both hands to do something and need to light up workspace, path etc..

\- Generator : at first i didn't think would need one coz i always could charge the ecoflow off main power line, but sometimes battery runs out and power doesn't come back for hours or days, that's why i got a generator, my first generator was a traditional 4stroke generator, 2000 watts, could handle the frighe freezer, lights etc.. but the ecoflow refused to get charged from it, because of hight harmonic distortion, so i got an inverter generator, which the ecoflow happily charges from and compared to the older generator it consumes much less fuel and produces much less noise, for the generator i always have 35 liters of fuel, incase local gas pump gets bombed or something, and every few months i just pour it into the car and stack up on fresh fuel

so to sum it up, ecoflow for everything except fridge freezer and boiler, when power outage is too long and battery is out, i power on the genny, boiler on to heat water, fridges on, and battery is charging, all runs on generator for couple of hours while the ecoflow charges, and then i shut off the genny and run the ecoflow.

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

So, recently I posted here a meetup idea and recieved an overwhelming response. The notions of the people being mixed- some claiming it to be useless while others showed keen interest - but honestly, even I didn't expect a casual reddit meetup to go THIS well, nor did the fellow reddior friends do 🩶🤌🏼

WE EXPLORED MORE THAN WE PLANNED : we explored Connaught Place, Janpath, Palika Bazaar & the nearby areas, all while having our hands over each other's shoulders- laughing & giggling (and clicking photos till we run outta storage) 🥹💪🏼

And there comes my favourite part: the street food!! i tasted some of the foods I didn't even knew the name of and that was so yumm, it tasted brtter with friends - a shared cold drink is better than an individual starbucks coffee 🙂‍↕️🫶🏼

I thrifted so many goods (infact, we went to the market place twice, lol) and it feels so wholesome ❤️😋

1pyagb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiranagar/comments/1pyagb9/the_best_matcha_and_coffee_handsdown/,The best matcha and coffee Handsdown!,"I came accross this place over the weekend, it's actually walking distance from the Toit Indiranagar.
Both my husband and I felt like having some coffee and we were heading towards Kink and we came across this super pretty cafe - Latte and Co. We tried the salted caramel Matcha ( me not being a matcha girlie), lotus biscoff cappuccino and some hot chocolate.
The matcha was very balanced, did not have that typical earthy after taste and the hot chocolate was yumm as seemed it it's been made using actual chocolate instead of the powdered one which tastes chalky. 
The coffee was good too. 

Highly recommend this place.

I grew up with my grandparents basically and I am currently living with them but it is exhausting tbh. My dad is narcissistic and they always enabled him it's always given me anxiety(still does) and now I just feel depressed and can't even bring myself to do the things I want to do! My dad has a room there and will come over sometimes which makes me feel uneasy and my grandparents need more help so I feel like I'm working when Im home too by helping them but I suppose thats my way of paying rent but at the same time I feel like I can't get much space or relax! I feel bad because I want to help them and spend time with them while I can but at the same time how much longer do I need to wait to live my life? It's not my full responsbility to help them my aunt and dad can help them! Being here yes I can save money I have about 20k in savings 1.8k in stock market and 1.5k in a Roth IRA but idk if that is enough to move out like is it worth moving out and spending more money? I also have about 15k in student loans to pay off but no car payment and I want to move out of state to Chicago, Philadelphia, or North Carolina to start fresh and be in a city I enjoy. It's also hard to find a job right now and idek what I want to do, I want to do many things and end up not doing much. I have a bachelor's in economics and spanish and I've applied to quite a few jobs here in LA(teaching, accounting/finance, and marketing) but haven't heard anything so I'm thinking I might be better off applying out of state but am I better off moving first or finding a job first?  The three places i want to move to are more affordable and it seems like maybe less competition?  The only work experience I have rn is being a tutor, administrative assistant and a behavioral health technician at a Rehab center(current job but it's not for me, only making $21 an hour in LA). I want to be able to not worry so much and actually enjoy the things I like to do and just start being an adult(i'm 25)  I did think about starting a matcha/coffee pop up too to make more money but idk how that would work if I end up moving. I could probably just start here and bring it to where ever I end up. I also want to take advantage of the insurance I have to get acl surgery and physical therapy for my shoulder but then that would just delay my move so idkkk Sorry this is all over the place!

1pyae5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1pyae5v/caffeine_having_opposite_effect/,Caffeine having opposite effect????,"Here’s my dilemma…

I’ll wake up in the morning and have energy. I’ll feel wide awake before my coffee. As soon as I sit down and enjoy my cup, I feel tired as soon as I’m done drinking it.

This one is even more weird. If I have an afternoon cup of coffee (3-4pm), I’ll go to bed with no issues (10pm). If I skip my afternoon coffee, I can’t sleep and end up going to bed around 1am. 

TLDR: When I drink coffee, I am tired. When I don’t, I am awake. 

Can anybody explain this? I feel like I’m going crazy over here. ",2,1766976296.0,insomnia,4,1.0,False
