1qrwsa5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qrwsa5/wanting_to_see_ex_again/,Wanting to see ex again,"Over a year ago. I met someone in a bar. We dated. She said she didn’t want a relationship but we were sleeping together. She was still not over her ex. While i was catching feelings and wanted to go into a relationship. She ended up saying she needed space. I was looking for an apartment then so i asked her if the building she was in, had any places (because it was a cheap and nice hotel that rents for students, and i was finding a hard time looking and our city is small so not many options) she said that was creepy and she doesn’t want me to rent there. We had a fight about it (i was mad that she thought i was following her smh). Anyway, fast forward i still think about her every now and then. I texted her once and we caught up, told her lets go over some drinks she said she was out. A year later and i interact with her on social media, she interacts back positively and likes my posts. I always had the urge to see her because i kind of miss being with her. I know ended badly but like I’m always dreaming about her and i was thinking to do something about it like invite her for coffee one last shot before i decide its never gonna work.

What should i do? How should i invite her to coffee or dinner after all this time?",1,1769847557.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1qrwrql,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/1qrwrql/how_to_get_a_job_at_a_startup_as_a_hungry_english/,how to get a job at a startup as a (hungry) english major,"i only know startups. but here's how to get a job at a startup. if you like startups or highly dynamic, chaotic workplaces though, this will work. every startup i've ever met is actively hiring or actively dying, never met any in between. 

I'm helping someone write JD's now and thus this is on my mind and thought i'd share. 

STEP ZERO: LOOK AT ROLE OPTIONS

Customer support, customer success. Generally the 'post-sales' world.

Alternately, sales. Makes a ton of money, I love it, obviously only like 2% of people find it compatible with their personality. 

Marketing--especially content marketing if you're a great writer. 

""producer"", pm, coordination type roles. 

Operations-- a nebulous term, means lots of different things in different places, but generally just a doer of things, often you're doing something very basic/boring (like data entry, calling everyone on a list and checking what's going on with them, some internal process of matching A to B) but the real job is to continuously automate that task and move onto the next one. 

STEP ONE: SOURCE STARTUPS

easy. go to ""built in"" --> there's a bunch for various cities, like built in la, built in denver, etc. it's a startup-focused listing site so fewer listings, very real. this way you can actually find job listings so you'll know for sure the company has something relevant to you.

alternately, look for funding announcements-- in particular series A and series B, later is fine, nothing sooner. look for big-ass numbers.

if your priority is comp, stay away from cool startups (meaning consumer-facing ones selling something you would love to buy yourself, like wine or astrology or dating). think: the driest b2b thing you could imagine. if you can't stomach learning the intricacies of data warehousing, i suppose, ok, hit up cool startups. (please note, you do not need any technical bg to work at a highly technical startup. i studied english. just read stuff, google stuff, im sorry but yes you can ask claude to teach you things very effectively).

start to get a sense for what TYPES of startups are hiring for what TYPES of roles. start to notice patterns in what types of companies there are a lot of. startup job posts are often kind of casual/eccentric and do reveal a lot about the culture/personality so you can also start to get a sense of what types of companies you like vs dislike. 

Decide on 2-3 really specific things you are into, but again, I strongly advise you be practical and stay away with obvious application of passions, be more open to what you find intriguing to think about. By specific things you're into, I mean things like very specific sub-industries, product types. Like neobanks, creative visualization software for designers, two-sided marketplaces with sustainable/reuse approach for big consumer items. Obviously if you pick something currently trending you'll have more companies to aim at.

STEP TWO: GET SMART

0 = i like clothes, this is an ecomm company

100 = i could be a guest on a podcast about the ecomm industry and carry my own for an hour

Try to get to 60-75% in your chosen 2-3 things. If you find this impenetrable advice to follow tbh I fear a startup may not be your place to live your best work life (no offense!! It's not like they're for everyone, many people hate them!!!) but look for hyper niche substacks, linkedin posts, sometimes a personal blog. in the tech world a lot of people loooove to make personal websites/blogs with extraordinarily detailed and generous write-ups of their professional skills. 

ability to self-lead through ambiguous research and quickly structure lots of info in your mind is definitely in top 3 non-engineer tech skills. 

STEP THREE: COLD EMAIL

If the company is <30 people and your email is genuinely good (don't be weird and be 75% smart on the topic), in my experience you have a 50% chance of getting a response back from the CEO. This isn't a begging for a job email, you're an expert now on the industry, so you're really almost striking a peer-to-peer tone here, you're intelligently explaining why you think what the company is doing is cool. 

In a very weird way....it's almost better to cold email when there isn't a job posting you're responding to. Kind of makes it less salesy. 

If the company is >50 people, try a decision maker who is not the CEO. 

STEP THREE BACKUP: COLD LINKEDIN

Ok, let's say step 3 somehow didn't work for you, my apologies! Find someone \*SENIOR\* to your desired role who isn't your competition, maybe someone who would be your manager or your manager's manager. ideally someone who has something vaguely in common with you on linkedin (or is a 2nd degree connection, intro or not). message, say what you admire about their career path, \*\*show you're smart on what their role likely entails\*\* and ask to get coffee to learn about that \*TYPE\* of role. again, actually more successful if they haven't posted a job role relevant to you.

1qrwqan,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1qrwqan/help_weight_has_plateaued_and_wont_go_down/,Help- Weight has plateaued and won’t go down,"I’m on day 10 of my water fast. The first week went great and I lost a lot of (water) weight. On day 8, I dropped more, but then on day 9 I gained 0.15kg and I thought hmm must be a one off day it happens and so I wasn’t terribly concerned. However, come day 10 and I’m still at the same weight.

This is really destroying my motivation as the objective of my fast is for fat and weight loss (water weight makes me look fatter so I want to lose water weight too). I’m doing a dirty fast so since the beginning of the fast I’ve been consuming:

Herbal tea

Iced coffee (with a little skimmed milk)

Electrolyte drinks 

A little kimchi for salt (I cannot stomach salt water it tastes vile and kimchi is super low in calories)

Water and flavoured water 

Diet lemonade 

Every day I consume minimal calories (I track everything very carefully), and so it’s not like I’m simply dieting- where a plateau would make more sense.

I drink 3L of water daily. I get 6-8k steps in every day, and get 7-8hrs of sleep a night. I go sleep and wake up roughly the same time. I’m not particularly stressed during the day or night. I weigh myself at the same time each day after going to the toilet in the morning when I wake up. 

I’ve watched a lot of videos on water fasting and I’ve never come across another person who’s plateaued for 3 WHOLE DAYS-only 1-2 max. This is really killing my morale and motivation. I’m now worried it’s going to stay at this weight and not go down. I have an event coming up in 2 weeks and I need the weight to go down.

Does anyone know why the weight has flatlined and have any advice for what I can do to make it go down again? And has anyone had any similar experiences? If so- how long was the flatline for and did it just go down eventually without changing anything?

1qrwmsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Slow-Egg-167/comments/1qrwmsm/my_red_light_therapy_journey_from_curiosity_to/,My Red Light Therapy Journey: From Curiosity to Consistent Results (Beyond the Hype),"Lately I’ve been diving deeper into red light therapy—not just for skincare, but for overall wellness—because I was tired of seeing it labeled as a “miracle fix” without any real context on what actually works. I started small with a basic LED mask (like most people do!), then moved on to more powerful red light panels, and eventually tried a red light therapy sleep bag that changed everything. Honestly, the more I experimented and researched, the more I realized how many tiny details make or break the experience: wavelength precision (not just “red light”), energy output (irradiance matters!), how close you are to the device, and most importantly—consistency. No one warns you about these little things when you’re first scrolling through TikTok or Instagram ads.

The first improvements I noticed were subtle, but unmissable: my skin felt softer to the touch, morning puffiness around my cheeks and eyes faded faster, and my overall tone looked less dull (goodbye, post-winter dryness!). But it wasn’t until I stuck with consistent sessions—15 minutes a day with my panel, or 30 minutes before bed in the sleep bag—that I saw the bigger changes. The fine lines around my mouth and forehead started to soften, especially when I used a device that combines red (630–660nm, perfect for surface skin) and near-infrared (850nm, the “invisible hero” that penetrates deeper). I never expected the anti-inflammatory effect to be so noticeable, but my occasional breakouts healed faster, and the redness around my nose (thanks to sensitive skin) calmed down significantly.

Red light therapy isn’t a dramatic overnight transformation—and that’s actually what I love about it. It’s a slow build, like nurturing your skin and body from the inside out, instead of a quick band-aid. It feels real, not like a temporary glow from a face mask or serum.

I also learned how different red light devices perform, and which ones fit different lifestyles. LED masks are great for busy mornings—slap it on while you make coffee, and you’re done. But panels? They’re game-changers for full-body coverage, with stronger irradiance that reaches deeper layers of skin and even muscles. The sleep bag, though, was my biggest surprise: slipping into it before bed feels like a cozy self-care ritual, and I noticed not just skin improvements, but better sleep quality too—probably because near-infrared helps with circulation and relaxation. It made me understand why people use red light therapy not just for anti-aging, but for muscle recovery (perfect after my weekend yoga sessions!), scar healing, and even easing minor joint soreness.

What helped me cut through all the noise online was finding explanations that linked science to real-life use—things like how long it actually takes to see results (4–6 weeks of consistency, not 3 days!), how close you should be to the panel (6–12 inches, no more, no less!), and why different wavelengths target different issues. I’m definitely not an expert, but I’ve learned enough to see why some people swear by red light therapy while others feel like they wasted money: it’s almost always about three things—consistency, using the right wavelength range, and choosing a device that delivers enough power to actually make a difference (cheap, weak devices won’t cut it).

I’m sharing all this because I wish someone had broken it down in a simple, honest way when I first started. Most articles online sound identical, and half of them feel like hidden ads for overpriced devices. Having a guide that explained the “why” behind the “what” helped me make smarter choices—so I didn’t waste money on gadgets that didn’t work, and instead invested in ones that fit my routine.

If anyone else here has been using red light therapy consistently (not just once in a while, I’m talking 3–5 times a week!), I’d love to hear your real results. I’m especially curious about long-term changes—fine lines, eye wrinkles, skin texture, or even how it’s helped with recovery after workouts. Let’s skip the marketing hype and share the real stuff—because that’s what actually helps people decide if this is right for them.",1,1769847005.0,u_Slow-Egg-167,0,1.0,False

""Damn it,"" Mack muttered, the word slipping out before he had even crossed the threshold. It hung in the narrow hallway for a second, then faded as the bathroom light hummed at the end. Ashford Lake, northern nowhere. Second floor apartment on Lake Street, worn carpet under his boots, one straight path to the open door. Fog pressed against the windows outside, muting the gray January morning, the distant creak of half-frozen docks carrying on the wind.

Mack paused in the doorway, hand on the chipped frame. The bathroom was small: tub, sink, toilet, barely room to stand. The light above the mirror buzzed and flickered, casting shadows across the chipped white tile and stained tub.

She lay in the bathtub. Late twenties, he guessed. Hair half unpinned, strands stuck to her forehead. Fingernails dug shallow marks into her own palms. A folded hand towel sat crumpled under her head. Her face was very calm, but starting to bloat at the edges. Her eyes stared past the ceiling, empty. The skin where water touched her skin carried the faintest shimmer, almost luminescent. Mack blinked it away. Trick of the flickering light.

The tub held about three inches of cloudy water.

The porcelain around her was wet but not overflowing. Her chest looked swollen, ribs visible under her skin. The air smelled faintly of soap and shampoo, with a metallic undertone. Outside, Ashford Lake stretched dark and still beyond the pines, half-frozen docks creaking in the distance. The water in the tub looked almost warm. Mack's jaw tightened. Those eyes. Cases like this always dragged up his brother. Unsolved. Beyond understanding.

""Door was locked when you got here?"" Mack asked without looking back, his voice rougher than he meant.

The uniform in the hallway shifted his weight. ""Yeah, neighbor says she hadn't seen her since yesterday morning. Heard the alarm clock going off through the wall, called it in when it wouldn't stop beeping since 7 AM till midday.""

Mack studied the girl's clenched fists, her calm face, the towel half fallen to the side. Another puzzle he couldn't crack.

""Any sign anybody else was in here?"" he said, forcing his focus back.

""No, sir. There were prints on the knob hers, a second set that we're running now and the landlords, who open the door before calling us in, no actually signs of entry though, no mess, just..."" The officer's voice trailed off.

""Just a dead woman who fought herself into a shallow tub,"" Mack finished, the words bitter.

He stepped closer. Her lips were parted slightly, face unnaturally peaceful despite the bloating. No ligature marks. No restraints. Just signs of struggle, then stillness.

The town's single main street visible through the frosted window. Closed diners with faded ""Perch Dinner"" signs, pickup trucks rusting at the curbs under sagging ice dams. He glanced up at the mirror, one patch clinging fogged in the corner.

""Who found her?"" he asked.

""Neighbor from 2A. Said she knocked, no answer, but the alarm clock kept going, so landlord opened up and they saw the bathroom light and water puddled in the hall,"" the uniform replied.

Mack nodded once. ""Get their statements. Times, everything they remember. Do not fill in the blanks.""

""Yes, sir,"" the uniform said.

His gaze dropped back to the drain. A single bead of moisture clung to the metal edge above the waterline, and it should not have been there. The droplet trembled, then fell into the cloudy water below. Somewhere in the wall, the pipes made a low groan. Mack's hand flexed. Another detail that didn't fit.

Mack straightened. ""Call the coroner. I want a look at her lungs as soon as they are done. Something about this is wrong.""

Outside, the January air felt heavy. Gray sky pressed low over Ashford Lake, the broad dark water ringed by skeletal docks and pine forests that swallowed the horizon. Streetlights glowed faintly through the fog rolling off the lake. Mack zipped his jacket and stepped onto the wet pavement, boots crunching salt grit. The weight of unsolved cases followed him.

A car pulled up to the curb. A young woman got out, Latina, hair pulled back tight, carrying a notepad. ""Detective Coleman?"" she said softly, matching his gruff tone but warmer. ""Lena Ortiz. Just transferred in.""

Mack nodded once. ""It's Mack. Nobody calls me Detective.""

""Heard you wanted backup,"" Lena said, her voice easing into his clipped rhythm. ""First, dead body in the tub? That's some welcome wagon.""

Mack almost cracked a smile. ""Depends on what this turns out to be.""

Lena looked toward the sagging apartment building, its paint peeling into the fog, faded ""For Rent"" sign swinging from a rusted chain. ""Uniforms mentioned shallow water, calm face. You think suicide?"" she asked, her words measured like his.

Mack watched the fog roll closer off the lake. ""Maybe. Or just a decent frame job. Marks on her palms are self-inflicted. Not from a struggle with someone.""

She jotted a note, then looked up, softening just enough. ""Coroner's prelim back yet?""

""Not yet. But three inches doesn't drown you, not like that,"" Mack said, his eyes distant.

Lena tilted her head, her tone curious but steady. ""What if she thought it was enough?""

A low rumble passed through the ground, faint tremor rippling the standing water in the gutter, rattling loose ice from the leaves as a train rolled by. Mack's head snapped up, the vibration hitting like a memory.

""Ranger station first. Park ranger's waiting, need a statement from Harlan about some hot pond.""

""Geothermal?"" Lena asked, her voice lifting slightly with interest.

""Heard that word. Let's see what he knows,"" Mack said as they walked toward her car, pines whispering in the lake wind.

Mack killed the engine outside the ranger station, snow crunching under tires. The outpost squatted low and log-built, smoke curling from its stack. Snowmobile tracks scarred the fresh powder leading up.

""Harlan Boone's inside,"" he said, turning to Lena. ""Park ranger. Saw the group three days back. We need his statement before we hike up and put eyes on this pool thing.""

Lena zipped her jacket higher, notebook ready. ""Lead on.""

Harlan Boone met them at the ranger station, oiling a rifle by the potbelly stove. Snowmobile tracks led to the porch, melting into slush. ""Pool's half-mile up the snowshoe trail,"" he said without looking up. ""Folks call it Devil's Cauldron. Warm spring, geothermals. Stays liquid through winter.""

Mack stomped snow from his boots. ""Six hikers three days back. What can you tell us?""

Harlan set the rifle aside, stood. Mid-fifties, barrel-chested, beard flecked gray. ""Heard you on the radio. Come on, We’ll walk and talk.""

The trail climbed steady, pines thick with hoarfrost. Harlan's breath puffed even. ""Seven of 'em showed up midmorning. Photographer named Tiffany, her boyfriend, skinny guy Evan, science teacher Becca, loudmouth Travis, Lori-Anne, Marc rolled in a little later. Oh, and that quiet one, Selena Cho, hung in the back. Easy to miss her.""

Mack's jaw tightened slightly. ""Dispatch said six.""

Harlan stated plainly “No no. Definitely seven.”

Lena jotted names. ""You talk to them?""

""Warned 'em straight,"" Harlan said. ""No swimming. Unstable chemistry up there, bad ground. Warm water messes the ice uneven. Told 'em and left for rounds.""

Mack scanned the white ahead. ""They listen?""

Harlan shrugged. ""Couldn't say for sure. Found their campsite later that day near the pool, net, grill marks, fish bones scattered around. Splashing echoes carry far up here, so maybe some wading? Travis type was the daring sort. Photographer had her gear out. Didn't see details myself. If they swam, they’d likely be fish food now—chum for the Cauldron.""

Lena smirked faintly. ""Or the fish turned the tables, served themselves up glowing on a platter. Nature's revenge buffet.""

Harlan barked a laugh. Mack kept walking.

They broke from trees. The pool crouched in a rocky basin, twenty feet across, surface steaming faint in the cold. Edges crusted thin ice, center dark and rippling. Sulfur hung heavy.

""That's it,"" Harlan said, stopping short. ""Campsite's just downhill, fish guts still there yesterday.""

Lena crouched at the edge, careful. ""They eat anything from here?""

Harlan scratched his beard. ""Campsite had pale fish scraps, big ones, scales all iridescent in the sun. Charcoal smell lingered. That's all I know for sure, guessing on the rest. They seemed healthy enough when they hiked out.""

Mack toed the mud. ""Any fights? Odd behavior?""

""Joking around,"" Harlan said. ""Normal group till they weren't.""

""Got time now?"" Mack asked.

Harlan glanced at the sky, clouds thickening. ""Snow coming. But yeah, I'll help you search around. Evidence don't wait.""

Mack traced the pool's steam. ""This connects them.”

Mack rubbed his jaw. His brother's death had been like this too. Strange details. No answers. After a while he grumbled ""Coroner next. Lena, you drive.""

They thanked Ranger Harlan for his help and told him that they would get into contact with him if they needed anything more.

The coroner's office sat across town by the lake. A low brick building where gulls wheeled over frozen docks, snow drifts piling against chain-link fence. Mack signed in at the desk, Lena staying close, fog beading on the windows.

Inside the exam room, the air was cold and sharp with bleach. The medical examiner looked up from a stainless steel table.

""Lungs from the Lake Street apartment are ready like you asked,"" she said clinically.

Mack approached the table. Tiffany Rhodes' chest cavity lay open, lungs looking heavy, waterlogged, swollen beyond normal. The wetter parts of her body tissue carried the faintest hint of inner luminescence, a ghostly underwater glow that flickered subtly. Mack blinked. Light trick off the wet surface. Had to be.

""Cause?"" Mack asked, voice tight.

""Drowning. From the water in her bathtub,"" the examiner said matter of factly.

Lena peered closer. ""Three inches doesn't fill lungs like that.""

The examiner nodded. ""She forced herself to inhale it. Kept breathing water until her lungs held impossible volume. No human does that willingly, takes tremendous will to override the gag reflex that long.""

Lena glanced at Mack. ""Why would she?""

Mack studied the lungs. They glistened, unnaturally full. ""That's the question,"" the examiner said. ""Medically, she drowned herself in slow motion. Physically baffling.""

Mack's jaw set. ""Impossible.""

Lena stared at the Y-incision, skeptical crease between her brows.

Back in the cruiser, snow thickening on the windshield. Mack gripped the wheel, mind chewing the autopsy. ""Has to be the boyfriend. Evan Pike's fault somehow. Argument went bad, he held her under, staged it sloppy. We bring him in now, pin it down.""

Lena frowned out the window. ""Slow drowning like that? Lungs saturated clean, no struggle marks. Doesn't add up. Boyfriend's a reach without more.""

""He's got explaining to do,"" Mack insisted, accelerating through flurries. ""Knew about the pool, her condition, there's a reason people always look towards the spouse first. Classic situation.""

Mack exhaled sharp. ""Either way, we grill him till he breaks. He'll give us something.""

Day 2

Ashford police station bullpen hummed quiet, fluorescents buzzing over case files spread across a shared desk. Coffee pots gurgled empty. Mack pinned photos to the board: Tiffany's calm face, fingernail marks where they dug into her hands, Harlan's sketch of the Cauldron. Lena sat across, notebook open to camper names: Tiffany, Evan, Becca, Travis, Lori-Anne, Marc, Selena.

""Seven at the pool,"" Lena said, tapping the list. ""Fish bones at camp. Who's Evan to you?"" She kept it light, testing. ""Long time in Ashford?""

Mack didn't look up, pinning the geothermal diagram. ""Boyfriend. Mechanic. Bring him in as soon as possible."" 

Silence. Lena tried again. ""Family here? You mentioned a brother once, dispatch chatter.""

His hand paused on a thumbtack. ""Old case. Closed."" He slid a file toward her. ""Cross-check alibis.""

Lena nodded, reading the room. Pushed no further.

Hours bled. Dispatch radioed updates: ""Evan Pike not at the garage. Apartment empty. We are running plates now."" Snow thickened outside, lake wind rattling blinds.

Lena stretched, eyes on the board. ""Fish scales glowed, Harlan said. Tiffany inhales two lungs full of water like she is a fish in the ocean. Connections?""

Mack grunted. ""Contamination.
Foul play. Something else I'm missing. Who knows? We'll find out.""

The clock hit 9:47pm. He stood. ""Stay put.""

Returned with two station coffees, steam curling black. Set one by her elbow without a word. “Extra sugar, how you took it earlier, right?”

Lena glanced up, surprised. ""Thanks.""

He sat, back to board. ""Lori-Anne next. Phone records.""

She sipped. Sweet. Steady partnership forming in silence.

**Dispatch crackled at 11:03 PM.** ""Evan Pike located. Shaken and soaking wet. Bringing him in now.""

Mack's jaw set. ""Finally we are making some headway. They'll get his processing done then we'll get to him tomorrow.""

Lena closed her notebook. She stayed at the board and the board stared back: seven names, one pool, impossible amounts of water. Something just doesn't add up.

Day 3

Evan Pike did not make a convincing killer.

He sat hunched in the metal chair in Interview Two, fingers knotted, knuckles chapped and raw. Grease stains ghosted the cuffs of his flannel shirt that still hadn't fully dried out, stubborn shadows the washing machine had given up on. His eyes were red-rimmed, skin sallow with lack of sleep.

""I loved her,"" he said for the third time. ""We argued, yeah, but nothing like… this.""

Mack watched him through the glass, arms folded. Lena stood at his side, shoulder almost touching his, notebook balanced on her forearm. She took a sip from her water bottle, held it a beat too long before swallowing.

""He's either a phenomenal actor,"" she murmured, ""or he's exactly what he looks like.""

""A mechanic whose girlfriend drowned in a tub,"" Mack said. ""And who was at that pool with her.""

Inside the room, Evan scrubbed his hands over his face, then reached for the Styrofoam cup in front of him. He drank like a man who had forgotten what thirst felt like until someone reminded him. The cup crumpled slightly in his grip.

""You notice how often he reaches for water even after knowing it's empty?"" Lena said quietly, capping her bottle.

""Fear dries you out,"" Mack said.

""So does grief,"" she said. ""So does salt.""

They went in together. The interview room smelled faintly of coffee, cleaning solution, and underneath, the sour tang of a man who hadn't bothered with hygiene since his life came off its tracks.

""Evan,"" Mack said, dropping into the chair across from him. ""This is Lena. Walk me through that day at the pool.""

Evan's eyes flicked between them, lingering on Lena's water bottle. His fingers drummed the table, restless.

""Can I get some more?"" he asked, tapping the empty cup.

They let him have the water. He drank in long, desperate pulls, Styrofoam crinkling under white-knuckled grip. Lena watched his throat work, made a note about the compulsion.

""We argued that morning,"" Evan rasped finally, voice cracked dry. ""Tiffany wanted to go back to the pool alone. For shots. I said no. Too dangerous after Harlan's warning.""

Lena leaned forward. ""Did you try to go with her anyways?""

He nodded, eyes glassy. ""I knew she wouldn't listen to me so I went over to her house at around 6:30 that morning to try to talk her down before I went to work. I knocked on her door a few times but it was clear she didn't want to talk to me. The door was locked and she didn't answer so I left.” His fingers twitched toward the empty cup.

Mack pressed harder. ""You expect us to believe you left and found going in that apartment?""

""I swear,"" Evan whispered, licking chapped lips, eyeing Lena's water bottle that was sticking out of her pocket. ""I loved it. Always did."" He frowned, “I mean her. I always loved her”

Lena flinched at that error and followed his eyes. She slowly closed her notebook. ""We'll need your clothes from that day and you stay in  the holding cell till processing.""

Evan nodded numbly, shoulders slumping. Just before they exited the door he called “Hey, could I get some more water please? In a bigger cup, maybe?” 

They left him with the guard. The last thing they saw of Evan was that he was practically inhaling another two cups of water.

Ninety minutes later, the call cut through station chatter. Uniform found Evan in the holding cell sink, face jammed into the shallow basin, cheeks pulsing faint blue under the harsh bulb. Water barely covered his nose, but his lungs pulled it deep—saturated, deliberate. No pulse when they yanked him free. Skin pruned white, lips tinged shimmer.

Mack stared at the custody cam stills, jaw locked. ""He was fine when we walked out.""

Lena's pen froze mid-note. ""Was he though? At the rate he was going through those waters seemed more like a compulsion rather than just a grief drink.""

The blue shimmer in the photo matched the victim's faint glow. This was no accident and it wasn't a suicide. Something hungry was unfolding between these deaths.

Day 4
The next day, the call about Becca came in.

The laundry room in Becca Nwosu's rental duplex would have been cramped even without the corpse. She knelt beside the utility sink when they found her, upper body folded over the basin, hair floating in gray, cooled suds. The washer hummed beside her, mid-cycle.

The first uniform had killed the water, but the last of it still dripped from the faucet. Plink. Plink. Plink.

""Same M.O.,"" Lena said quietly. ""Different choreography.""

Mack moved closer. Her hands dangled in the tub, fingers wrinkled, skin blanched. The water that touched her knuckles carried a faint blue sheen. It pulsed, slowly, a lazy heartbeat of light.

He felt the hair rise on the back of his neck.

""Please tell me you see that,"" Lena murmured beside him, her voice tight.

He narrowed his eyes. The glow didn't vanish when he wanted it to. It stayed, just shy of obvious, as if it were embarrassed to be noticed.

""Fluorescent paint,"" he said. ""Detergent additives. Glows under blacklight.""

""That is not a blacklight,"" Lena said.

He straightened, stepping back.

""Write it down. We get it tested.""

After jotting down the note Lena shut the notebook with a soft snap.""That makes three. All with more water in the lungs than makes sense. All with water that acts like it wants to be seen.""

""Or we're seeing what we want,"" he said. ""We're cops, not ghost hunters.""

She gave him a look, one of skepticism and patience.

""Then let's go find someone who isn't a cop,"" she said. ""Selena Cho is still breathing.""

Just then, **The dispatch radio cut the tension**  ""Travis DeLeon, 32, unresponsive. Trailer off County 17. Neighbor saw him hauling a five-gallon bucket inside last night.""

Mack slammed his palm on the cruiser hood, the sound echoing off the sagging duplex. ""Jesus Christ! Four dead in four days? All pool-connected, all drowning in some PUDDLES!, and I'm supposed to believe that glowing ghost is getting a hold of all of them? This isn't a case anymore—this is a goddamn slaughter! Tiffany tub, Evan sink, Becca suds, now Travis bucket? What the hell is *killing* them?""

Lena touched his arm light. ""Mack. Travis first. Then we have to find Selena. We need to some get answers.""

He exhaled hard, fists unclenched. ""Alright. Let's move."" 

When they got there the trailer reeked of stale beer and wet dog. Travis lay facedown hanging off the bed, head dangling into a five-gallon bucket, eyes bulging and cheeks bloating. At least half of the water was gone from the bucket and the top half of his head that was still submerged pulsed,  throbbing rhythmic under his sallow skin. Pruned hands clutched the rim like he was trying to pull himself deeper. 

Lena knelt. ""Voluntary again. All these people…All of them having their brains hijacked by some freak compulsion. We need to get ahead of this somehow.”

Lena blinked hard, a single tear tracing her cheek in the dim trailer light.

1qrwklo,https://www.reddit.com/r/chronicfatigue/comments/1qrwklo/longterm_fatigue_that_seems_tied_to_my_neck_and/,Long-term fatigue that seems tied to my neck and balance system – wondering if anyone relates,"I’ve been trying to make sense of a long-standing health pattern and wanted to share it in case it resonates with anyone else.

I had **fatigue even before** a more obvious neurological-type event in my early 30s. Around that time, I started getting left-sided symptoms (base of skull, ear, face, throat), and over the years I’ve noticed something consistent:  
my symptoms are **posture- and load-dependent**, not illness-dependent.

Sustained desk work, visual focus, or anything that makes my head drift forward tends to trigger fatigue and neurological sensations. Lying or sitting in certain supported positions can bring relief. Exercise that loads my neck (like calisthenics or bracing-type movements) has actually made my left arm feel weaker, not stronger.

What’s made this more interesting to me recently is learning more about the **three balance/orientation systems of the body**:  
• visual system (eyes)  
• vestibular system (inner ear)  
• cervical proprioception (especially upper neck)

These three systems constantly cross-check each other to answer: *“Where is my head in space?”*

The upper cervical ligaments and deep suboccipital muscles play a big role in this. If ligament integrity or joint tracking is off (even subtly), the muscles seem to compensate by staying active all the time. Over long periods, that can mean:  
• chronic muscle guarding at the base of the skull  
• altered sensory input  
• high energy cost just to hold the head steady

I’ve also learned that when joints are chronically stressed, the body can sometimes adapt by:  
• muscle overactivation  
• fascial thickening  
• and even calcification around stressed areas  
(not as “damage” so much as the body trying to stabilize something)

That made me reframe my fatigue. Instead of thinking “I’m weak,” it feels more like:  
**my system is spending a lot of energy stabilizing and orienting my head**, especially when I’m upright and visually focused.

What’s strange is that pain has never been the main feature — it’s more:  
– fatigue  
– brain fog  
– balance weirdness  
– one-sided neurological sensations

Walking and gentle movement feel safer than strength work. Swimming feels great when I can do it. Supportive sleep positions help. Coffee once triggered panic attacks in my late 30s, which stopped when I removed it — which also makes me think this is about arousal and regulation rather than pure psychology.

I’m not claiming a diagnosis here. I’m just trying to understand a pattern that seems mechanical and sensory rather than infectious or purely psychological.

I’m curious:  
• Does anyone else here notice fatigue that’s clearly linked to neck posture?  
• Has anyone noticed relief from support rather than stretching?  
• Has anyone explored the visual/vestibular/neck balance relationship in their own symptoms?

We went out for coffee last week, then this week we went out and played minigolf and bowling. He was goint to take me out for dinner, but I already ate. So we got ice cream instead and just hung out in his car because it was freezing cold outside. He’s already asked if we can go get dinner and play pool next week. I don’t know if we will become something serious or not, but I like him quite a lot. He’s not all that bad-looking, he’s highly intelligent, and we don‘t really run out of things to talk about. Plus, he always pays. This is my first relationship, so I don’t know how these things are supposed to go, but I’m liking so far what I’m seeing. I keep getting these butterflies in my stomach and can’t sleep a wink. It’s a lot of fun, at least right now.

Here is my problem. I do not have the best relationship with my parents. My mom in particular. She can be cruel and spiteful at times; I think it’s untreated mental illness, but that is another story for another time. But she has made fun of me for not having a boyfriend before. My dad isn’t cruel, but he will definitely be one of those overprotective parents. Think the dad from Dirty Dancing. All of this to say, I don’t know if I want them to know that I‘m going out with someone. I’m scared especially that my mom might use him to hurt me, especially if we break up. She’ll yell at me for displeasing her somehow and say that‘s why Cody broke up with me.

But I don’t think I can really keep this hidden either, since my younger sister attends the same university as me. If me and Cody get serious, she’s bound to find out. She probably won’t be very happy about it and she will definitely run and tell Mom and Dad. So there’s my pickle. How do I handle this?",1,1769846754.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

That's been my mantra this whole month since you've been gone.

I've slowly acclimated to your absence. 

The nights have been cold, but I now double up on socks and keep the space heater on at night, as you are no longer the warmth under my covers. 

In the mornings, instead of sending you greetings via texts, I light some incense and recite prayers in front of my altar, asking my ancestors and the universe for guidance and strength. 

Instead of sending you voice memos about funny encounters or random anecdotes throughout the day, I close my eyes and breathe deeply. 

Instead of bouncing ideas back and forth about the dinner menu with you, I meal prep and try out adventurous new recipes. 

In the evening, when my day is wrapping up and I have some down time, instead of sitting on the couch while lamenting the pain of your betrayal, I throw on my running shoes and run until I feel like I can't breathe anymore and I feel alive. 

Instead of feeling helpless and sorry for myself, I allow the pain to batter over me like an ice bucket challenge, and sometimes I gasp audibly at how fresh the wound still feels. 

The pain has become familiar. I now sit across the table from it like an old friend having a cup of coffee. It lives in the bags under my eyes, which are slowly dissipating as my sleep routine improves. It's around the corner of my every thought and it flashes across my mind consistently throughout the day, alongside quick kaleidoscope collages of your face, of the two of us wearing rain coats on our way home. 

But I haven't gotten used to the thirst I feel for your lips. How famished I feel for your comfort and touch, the way you used to rub the back of my head when I'd drive us around, the way you'd interlock your fingers with mine while we laid in my bed, about to go to sleep. The way you wouldn't let go of me... until you did.

I've slowly acclimate to your absence. But I don't know that I'll ever be used to you being gone.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1qrwdxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1qrwdxi/my_35m_sister_33f_had_me_charged_with_dv/,My (35M) sister (33F) had me charged with DV,"Background.

I am a 35-year-old man, and I live with my stepfather (breadwinner), mother (disabled, post and pre-op surgery disintegrating hips and shoulders), and my 13-year-old brother (very autistic), whom I care for every day.

My sister is currently living in a DV relationship with an emotionally and financially abusive domestic partner, with their two children, ages 5 and 10.

For the last three years, we've been unofficially housing her and her children by opening up our home to them, with the expectation that she would quit her drinking and recreational pill partying enough to be capable of setting her marriage straight and uniting her family so the kids can have proper lives of their own and create some kind of peace.

My sister and I have never had the strongest relationship due to her compulsion to abscond from home for weeks and months at a time as soon as she turned 13, leaving me to care for our mum, who had a horrific OxyContin dependency as a result of spinal surgery a few years prior.

She's run away, hooked up with any guy she wanted to, and after their chaos had run them out of wherever they were staying together, she would move herself and her boyfriends into our house because our mother has no boundaries and very clearly suffers as a result of that, which my stepfather and I have to endure for HER sake.

My sister has always been rude, spiteful, manipulative, and cunning.

On NYE 2025, she got drunk enough to admit to family after my mother accidentally outed her as trying to undermine my family's relationship and alienate my parents from me so that they would kick me out to make space for her and hers.

We've made space for her and the kids. She is my sister, and they are my niece and nephew, and I love them all fearfully, and I want them to be here if they cannot be at home.

Our brother is 13 and very heavily autistic, and the absolute love of my life. I haven't ever been lucky enough to meet a woman and have children of my own, and I truly believe God gave me a son in my brother; I breathe for him.

My sister has never shown much affection or connection with our brother. Her partner mocks him routinely and even encouraged his own son (my nephew) to make fun of his stims and noises maliciously, and both my niece and nephew compete with our brother with his own parents for their attention, and they have no choice but to give in because my sister won't help, she just will not concern herself with her family at all.

If she's not on the phone or texting or doomscrolling until 3 am every night, she's sleeping all day, letting her 5-year-old eat icypoles or iceblocks for breakfast because the kids KNOW BETTER than to wake her up if she's asleep, there will be hell to pay, even at 9 am.

She's made overtures to my mother about figuring out methods of causing me or our stepfather to abandon the home, she's openly bullied us and made threats to do exactly what she has done now.

So she hasn't done any of this in the dark, so to speak. But we've mostly brushed it off as fantasy, as an escape from her depressing reality; we never truly believed it was her intent peaking through her words.

Thursday before last, I was nearly ready to leave for my second shift at a new job I was super keen on. I discovered my niece was just covered in iceblock juice because she'd been eating them instead of breakfast. After all, they know they're not allowed to wake mum up.

I made my mother a coffee, and made my brother breakfast like I do every morning. Our mother can barely get out of bed, but she will force herself to at her own detriment for the kids. She's inevitably overwhelmed far too quickly, and her son, our brother, has to sit in his room because he's too timid to get in the other kid's way throughout the day.

I've brought this up several times, and the last time, my sister had said, ""Who cares about (our brother's name)? All he does is sit in his room and spit his drink on the floor all day; he's fine without anyone.""

After I had tied my shoes, it was almost time for me to go, and I was anxious that my sister still wasn't up and embracing the day, so I began to nag at her to get up, feed her children a proper meal for breakfast, and get her ass into gear.""

And that's when she said, ""Go f\*\*k yourself, (my name), you piece of S\*\*t.""  
When I heard it, I felt like someone just shot me in the chest, and I saw white.

I walked into the living room where we had put the spare bed for her, and I ripped her out of bed, shouting at her to get up and help our mother and her kids so our mother and brother didn't have to suffer while she slept all day.

Our mother was already reprimanding her for what she said when I entered the room and was talking me down from yelling back and forth with my sister. My sister aimed and threw a fist straight past the back of our mother's head and into my face.

It took a few seconds for the shock of that to set in, then I put my arm around the back of her neck and dragged her toward the front door by the arm she'd punched me with in a rage, screaming at her to leave, ""I need your help, you won't help us, so get out!"" 

She was trying to open her phone, but she and Mum began fighting over it, and I took it out of both their hands and set it down. I left the room and called my stepfather as I began to have a breakdown because I wasn't going to my new job now.

An hour later, the police turned up to arrest me. I spent the next 8 hours in a 5x1.5 cell before I was interviewed and given an 2 year long AVO revoking any contact with my sister, my niece, and my nephew.

She has sent messages to my mother, taunting her with my probable imprisonment, and we screenshot that before she deleted the message. She's blackmailed our parents with withholding the kids from them as long as I am a member of the family (Children I toilet trained, taught to swim, weaned off of baby formula at too late an age because my sister's partner skims money out of the food budget for things he wants despite his respectable earnings and my sister thinks it's easier than making them actual meals.

My stepfather won't talk to her anymore because she tried to have a physical confrontation with him as well, for putting his foot down concerning her lifestyle and the way she treats us horribly.

Our mother is heartbroken because she has to defend me in court now. I have family in the police, and this has been an embarrassment to them. Her children are trapped with their mother and father, forced to live in that emotionally dead home.

I never intended to harm my sister; I DID intend to drag her out of bed.

I need to know I'm not alone in being hostage to an emotionally abusive and psychologically malignant sibling whose only real concern is what we can do for them, so that they can eat their cake and have it too, bar the consequences.  
  
I forgive her constantly in my heart for every burden she ties up on our shoulders, the way she speaks about our brother, stepfather, and me. But she hates us more and more every day we aren't out of her way.

The next day, our parents were hell-bent on cleansing the house of any trace of her or the kids; it was like cleaning levin out of a house for passover.

Our whole family has been aching for her to step into a new life with us outside of her toxic relationship, and they're now all aware of her attempts to sabotage various relationships in the family.

I'm speaking with legal aid on Tuesday and have court on the 10th.

I was already training for a career in law enforcement before this happened and she was aware of how much progress I'd made and how excited I was to finally achieve something that fit so well within my personality and desire to protect people like my brother from the abuses of the world, that's gone now, I have to make other discoveries about providing a loving home and stable income for my brother's sake because he is my son after our parents pass away and they're in their late fifties now and can't keep up.

  
I'm so tired of being bullied, ridiculed, belittled, and spat on by her; we all are. And now I might be a criminal for finally cracking under her pressure.

I don't think I can ever trust her again, or even look her in the eye anymore. I want us both in counselling so we can figure this out, but she's laughed that off in the past, too.

I'm praying day and night for the Lord's will, not mine, that the discernment of the court isn't weak and sees that there is a pattern of behaviour in her that has matured for decades in chaos, and that her uncommunicated expectations have led her to premeditated resentment toward her family for not giving her what she wanted without even asking.

We don't care if we're smushed in a bit, pack your bags and come. That's my family. Bring me my nephew so I can walk him to school every day and tell him I'm proud of him because his dad doesn't. Bring me my niece so I can read Robert Green's Mastery out loud to her while she lounges on me on the front lawn, repeating what I read to her and following the print with her finger, her dad doesn't.

I toilet-trained my niece because my sister wouldn't, and I trained her off of formula because my sister wouldn't, I sleep-trained her FOR MONTHS because my sister didn't want to, while they lived here during a period both my stepfather and I were early to work.

I do their laundry, wash their dishes, pick up every piece of everything they've touched, eaten, or emitted off the ground because my sister wouldn't. She's never made a single attempt to bond with our brother, who pours God's love right into you all day long.

My nephew HATES sharing and is selfish with his interests; he's highly neurotic and jealous of his special uncle's needs because he feels robbed of attention if any eyes are off of him for two minutes, I'm convinced he has an anxiety disorder due to the distress of not knowing where his mother is when she's out power drinking and pill popping with her spinster bestie.

She's attempted and nearly succeeded in fulfilling a suicide pact with her in the past.

My sister came home one afternoon and slept for damn near three days recovering from whatever she'd put herself through.

She swipes our mother's bank cards to pay for her children's groceries without asking because her partner abuses their funds intentionally because he thinks we should have to pay for a whole week's groceries since they're at their grandparents' house.

The pressure's just been absolutely insane, and the head games are fucked, and I feel like I've been gaslit by a psychopath.

I have to go out for a run in a few minutes, so I'll leave things here.

I'm just looking to see if anyone else can mirror my experiences here, so I know I'm not alone.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

One button, instant guided breathing, works offline.



Background: I was drinking 4 cups of coffee to focus, then dealing with anxiety.

I found box breathing, a Navy SEAL technique, but could not find an app that was not a 10 minute meditation in disguise. So I built one.



**Tech:**

React Native and Expo, TypeScript, Supabase, RevenueCat



**The grind:**

* 112 builds over 6 months
* 2 Apple rejections, they test on iPad even if you disable tablet support
* Hardest problem was syncing haptics to breath phases so you can use it eyes closed during a meeting



**Monetization:**

* Freemium, core breathing techniques are free, advanced features behind a paywall
* RevenueCat handling in app purchases



**What worked for launch:**

* Hit #4 on Product Hunt & #1 on Uneed
* Marketing on X, Linkedin
* “I built this because I needed it” beats feature lists every time



**What I am struggling with:**

* 400 downloads, only 2 subscriptions even with lot of daily use.
* Getting users to open Squair instead of doomscrolling when anxiety hits
* Figuring out whether push notifications help or annoy



Honest question for this sub: how do you solve retention for an app people only need in specific moments? It is not a daily habit app. It is an emergency tool. That makes the retention game completely different.

1qrwd65,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qrwd65/im_22f_having_doubts_about_moving_in_with_my/,I'm [22F] having doubts about moving in with my boyfriend [22M]. Any advice?,"My boyfriend \[22M\] and I \[22F\] are both recent college grads/graduating soon and are going to be in the same city post-grad. We've been looking to move-in together but I'm not entirely sure anymore. For context, I graduated a bit ago and have been back at home with my parents while I wait for my job to start. He's still in college, but graduating soon and is lined up to be in the same city post-grad. We've been together for a little over two years now.

One of the main reasons for moving-in is that during college, we basically spent 24/7 together. We went our separate ways for classes, clubs, occasional social things, etc., but were together outside of that (he spent nearly every night at my apartment). I didn't have a problem with it, and the only issue I had was that I spent less time with my roommate/best friend with him being over all the time. 

Post-grad, the expectation is that we're going to go back to being together 24/7, and that there's just no reason for us to live separately; it'll be a waste of rent. And if we do go separate, he probably won't even furnish his that much, because he'll be spending all his time at mine + there's the expectation of us moving-in together eventually. But a part of me feels like I've fallen out of rhythm of being around him all the time with our long-distance at the moment? Moving-in together feels very sudden even though we've basically already done it. It also feels different when you're working a 9-5 instead of being a student. My 'me time' is very important, and I feel like I'll have less of it now, but I'm confident we'll be able to work out how we'll both have time to ourselves. He also had this argument I agreed with, that he'd rather find out sooner than later if we can't live together/aren't lifestyle compatible. 

The biggest obstacle in our path of moving-in together is that my parents most likely won't let me move-out of the house and directly into a place with my BF. It's a bit untraditional for them, and they also think I should spend at least a few months to a year living on my own, enjoying that kind of life. I don't mind the idea at all, but my BF doesn't care for living alone at all; there's nothing appealing to it for him. Right now, the assumption is that if my parents don't allow it (pretty likely), then we just wait out a few months and then move-in together. But in the meantime, it'll be separate living how I described above.

One of the reasons I think I'm having doubts is because being back at home with my parents has just really gotten to me. I'm not doing anything with this in-between time right now (I don't want to work a job if I don't have to; I'll be working the rest of my life. Can't travel or anything because I need to babysit grandparent while parents are at work) and it's honestly made me a little depressed? I'm saying 'little' because I don't really know and I'm trying to be positive lol. I've gotten back into some of my old hobbies, but not doing much honestly. And my mom's solution to my 'depression' is getting me to take over all the house chores so 'I have something to do with myself and fill the time.' Whenever I go out to spend time in a coffee shop, or if I go spend the weekend with my friends, there's usually some quip implying how I can't stand to be at home and I hate it here and I hate them and can't wait to get out of here yada yada.

So right now, I just want time to myself more than anything honestly? And/or to get out of this house? And moving-in with my boyfriend kinda makes me feel like I'm taking on the responsibility of taking care of him and cleaning up after him too, even though he's reassured me many times that I won't have to do that. But as a daughter(? idk, that's my theory), I can't help but think it's going to be like that anyway.

Another thing that's been getting at me is how upset this situation has been making him. The idea of us not living together feels like it's awful for him, but I'm pretty sure the main contributing factor to his mood is my parent's having a say in all this stuff. Either way, I'm trying to stay on the bright side of this with the ""we're going to be in the same city post-grad!"" but he doesn't care about that anymore. And I feel awful because I hate seeing him  upset like this and it seems like a situation I should be able to fix easily, even though I know I can't. And with how sad he gets about this, I want to mentally prepare myself for moving-in with him because I want to see him happy. But I'm also realizing this is most likely the chronic people pleaser inside of me talking, and I know that shouldn't be a reason for the two of us moving-in together. He's the sweetest person I've ever met and has always treated me so well, and I just want to do whatever I can for him. My parents have caused a lot of troubles for us, and I can never do anything about it.

TL;DR  
Feeling a little pressured to move-in with my BF. My parents probably won't allow it, and living with my parents for the past few months has left me wanting to not be responsible for taking care of people. BF is upset over the likely possibility of us not moving-in together, and I'm upset that he's upset.

1qrwcs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1qrwcs1/the_lighthouse/,The Lighthouse,"They woke to silence so complete it felt like pressure.

Not the quiet of sleep or snowfall, but an absence—as if sound itself had been removed from the world. Their eyes opened to stone curving overhead, the walls damp and rimed with frost. Cold lived everywhere, settled deep in their bones. A lighthouse, they realized, though no memory followed the thought. The knowledge simply *was*.

They sat up. Pain flared behind their eyes. They couldn't even remember their name. They didn't even recognize their own face, or this place. They only knew the certainty of being awake and terribly alone.

The lighthouse spiraled upward and downward around them, room after circular room, all intact and all wrong. A kitchen held tins of food neatly stacked, labels faded beyond reading. A narrow cot waited as if they had only just stood up from it. Near the top, the lantern room loomed—and there, the problem revealed itself.

The light was dead.

Not dim. Not flickering. Dead in a way that felt deliberate. The great lens was clouded with grime and ice. Switches lined the wall, worn smooth by countless hands. They flipped one. Then another. They pulled levers, twisted knobs, slapped panels in rising frustration.

Nothing happened.

A tightness formed in their chest. Lighthouses were meant to shine. That truth pressed down on them with the force of law. Somewhere—*somewhen*—the light mattered. Ships depended on it. Lives depended on it. They could almost feel the weight of unseen eyes, waiting beyond the ice.

They searched for instructions. In a small desk beside the lantern room lay a thick logbook, its cover cracked with age. Inside were pages filled edge to edge with frantic writing. The letters were familiar, almost readable, but meaning slid away the moment they tried to grasp it. Their head throbbed as if resisting the effort.

One page stopped them.

The words were larger, carved deep into the paper as if written in anger or fear.

**FIX THE LIGHT**

Their breath caught. “I’m trying,” they whispered to the empty room. Their voice sounded wrong—too loud, too lonely.

Below, they found the generator room. It was half-buried in ice, metal split open, cables snapped clean and dangling uselessly. Frost coated everything. They worked until their fingers numbed, then burned. They forced frozen wheels to turn, slammed panels shut, tied wires together with shaking hands.

Nothing.

Time lost its edges. They slept when exhaustion dragged them down, woke with the same crushing certainty pressing on their chest. The light was still out. Each time they climbed the tower, hope flared briefly—then died again in the dark lantern room.

The pressure grew.

Not just fear, but obligation. As if the lighthouse itself expected them to fix it. As if the world beyond the walls was holding its breath, blaming them personally for the darkness.

Through narrow windows they saw only white—ice and snow stretching endlessly in every direction, no sea, no sky, no horizon. They went outside once, stepping into wind so cold it stole thought itself. The coffee they held in their hand freezing within seconds. After a few steps they stopped.

There were no footprints behind them.

They screamed. The sound vanished instantly, swallowed without echo.

Panic took hold then, sharp and complete. If the light did not work, and there was no one to see it anyway, why did fixing it feel like the only thing that mattered? Why did failure feel unbearable?

They ran back inside and tore open the logbook again. The final page was blank.

Their hand found the pen.

It moved without permission, scratching words into the paper, pressing harder and harder until the page nearly tore.

**FIX THE LIGHT**

They stared at it, nausea rising.

Fragments surfaced—hands writing the same words before, countless times. Endless attempts. Endless failure. The same panic, looping back on itself. The lighthouse wasn’t waiting for them to succeed.

It was waiting for them to *try*.

  
'What is this place?' they asked themselves.

They stumbled back to the lantern room, flipping every switch at once, screaming as sparks flew and died uselessly. The lens remained dark, a blind eye staring out over a world with nothing in it.

They slid to the floor and pressed their forehead to the cold glass, breath fogging briefly before fading. Outside, the ice stretched on, silent and indifferent. No ships. No witnesses. No rescue.

At last, the truth settled in—not with drama, but with a crushing, quiet certainty.

The lighthouse was not broken.

The world was empty.

And they didn't even know why they were here.

The pressure never lifted. The need to fix the light never faded. Even knowing it would never work, they stood again, wiped frost from the lens, checked the dead switches, and prepared to try once more.

Hello world, my name is Vedat. I am 27 years old and recently opened a small restaurant in Azerbaijan. While I work hard to grow my business, I carry a mission in my heart that is much bigger than my kitchen.
​In our community, I see many families struggling to put food on the table. As a business owner, I couldn't just stand by and watch. That’s why I started the ""One Business, One Family"" project.
​The Idea is Simple but Powerful:
Every restaurant, shop, or local business ""adopts"" at least one family in need within their neighborhood and provides them with regular food support. A small business can support one family, while larger ones can support ten or more, depending on their strength.
​Why am I doing this?
I believe that since we earn our livelihood from this community, it is our responsibility to give back. Helping others doesn't decrease our wealth; instead, it strengthens society and fills our hearts with peace. I started this journey alone in my hometown, and now I want to take this vision to a global scale.
​I am not asking for financial donations.
I am simply asking you to be my voice. In my region, the population is small, and it’s hard to build a large following. I need you to follow my Instagram account @kafe57_kababci and my ""Buy Me a Coffee"" page.
​The Goal:
If I can reach a significant audience and show that this social responsibility is loved and supported, other businesses in my region—and eventually the world—will follow suit. When they see a business thriving because it gives back, they will be inspired to do the same.
​The more people we reach, the more effective we can be globally. Let's turn this dream into a movement.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1qrwakb,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1qrwakb/starbucks_will_never_bring_back_coffee_culture/,"Starbucks will never bring back coffee culture, nor do they want to.","I keep seeing videos on TikTok posted by baristas at different coffee shops talking about how “xyz thing has ruined coffee culture” or something similar along those lines. 98% people say it’s because of Starbucks and it’s true. The meetings we have had this past year have all been about the stupid “Welcome back to Starbucks” ideas and enforcements. They are right when they say we are not in the coffee business, but we are not also in the people business. Starbucks is fast food plain and simple. Only around 20-30% of customers (depending on lobby size) actually are there to sit, enjoy their coffee, and do other activities. The rest of the customers? They are wanting to get in and out as fast as they can and will let you know it. All of Starbucks stores can’t make the change to being a regular cafe again. Our customers are programmed to go to Starbucks because it’s easy, quick, mid coffee with tons of customizations and options just like most fast food places.

Informing and wanting baristas to make connections, talk to customers more, write on cups, and even push for “for here” ware is just Starbucks  trying to act like a cafe when it’s not possible. Being able to connect, make drinks fast, make drinks consistent, and act like it’s a cafe is impossible. It’s not impossible in the way that it’s too much work but to be able to thrive in certain categories you sacrifice the others. Making drinks fast? You won’t be really able to connect and there’s a bigger chance to mess up on drinks. Making connections and interacting with customers? You can’t make drinks fast so if you have a rush or are just a busy store people will become annoyed and upset. My manager says “If you talk to them they are usually fine with waiting.” when that is not true for most customers. Once again, most people at Starbucks are trying to get in, order, get their drink and leave. 

If Starbucks truly wanted to go back to their roots they will have to make a lot of changes. There would be no more drive thru or pick up stores. You could maybe have mobile order, but the only customizations would be changing milk and adding one to two syrups to drinks. No more refreshers, no more frappes, no cold foam, no protein, and no more random offshoot drinks like the energy drinks or adding the popping pearls. The focus would only be on coffees and teas and cut down on customizations over all. Though with this said, Starbucks will never do this. All the things they would have to change would be what makes them the most money. I constantly make more cold bar drinks than I do hot bar drinks 80% of the year (I live in a warmer state). Our store would not make as much as we do if those items and our drive thru was gone. 

Overall just having these meetings and seeing these posts made me want to write something here. The company needs to stop pretending and pushing all this “Back to Starbucks” shit and actually focus on what they can do to optimize production and make it easier on baristas. You can change what the baristas do, but it won’t change the customers. Starbucks will never go back to its roots.

Hi I'm 24M and I was in a 3 year relationship, it was my first and oh boi it was not pretty.... There was no cheating involve, it just didnt work out in the end... We did spend one day talking about it and it ended in good terms at least.... Although it still stuck with me, all the regret.... even though she admitted that it was also her fault for falling out of love, I still can't help but think it's my fault for making her fall out of love because of the things I did.... like I think it's because of ME which is why she decided to let go.... it was so worse that I had to go to therapy (currently am) just to find out I've been neglecting my OWN self.

We would have fights about what I did wrong or what I did that made her feel hurt and not cared for and honestly it was tiring for me but I didnt give up and I genuinely tried but it became a pattern... We fight -> I promise not to do it again -> I did it again(forget how to treat her right or make her feel loved and cared for). And for the Longest time I've always seen myself as a failure of a boyfriend...

I forgot how to be happy on my own and didn't quite have my own identity (as my therapist said, I lack sense of self), it got so bad that I started doubting my own decisions and capability, because everything I thought was right, always ends up in her being right, and no she's not being manipulative, with every fight we had, one of those is I thought I was right but with her showing proof every single time, it made me feel like my memory of everything is ALWAYS WRONG, like regardless of what I thought to be true, it always ends up wrong, which is why I even doubt my own judgement and led to a mindset of ""its better to be compassionate, than to be right"" which is not a bad mindset to have but it made be less confident in own decisions and honestly it made me feel less of a man who can't make his own decisions....

I was more willing to change myself for her, into someone she would like and prefer, someone who can lead and make his own decisions..... and just to give you context, her likes and dislikes wasn't hard to begin with, she just wants to be treated with love and care in a way she would appreciate and felt cared for, but unfortunately I couldnt be consistent enough to give those treatments to her, and she was tired of the same pattern, same scenario, making her feel tired, which is why we broke up.

  
Afterwards, I lost myself, I've been having relapses during work, strong fucking voices in my head, heavy feelings in my heart (mostly regrets) and calling myself worthless (I forgot the term but something like that)

  
Eventually it led me to self isolation and genuinely un-aliving myself... thats when I decided to go to therapy and I gotta say its one of the best decisions I made, so far I've been doing the things that makes me happy, hanging out more with friends, interacting with random people with similar interests (I'm an ambivert so there are times that I'm fine with being alone) and just doing myself a favor and enjoy the little things that makes me happy...



If someone is also going through some really heavy stuff to the point you don't know anymore, I highly suggest you go to therapy.... If you're on a tight budget, My biggest advice I could give you is talk to somebody, ANYBODY... just to make things lighter because I isolated myself at first but realized I was just making things harder...  and also DO WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY RIGHT NOW, it could be as simple as going for a walk, talking to friend, eating/cooking your favorite food, or ordering a coffee at your favorite place, LIKE GENUINELY ANYTHING YOU ENJOY, BECAUSE YOU DESERVE IT!!

  
As of now I'm frequently going to manila just to catch up with my friends there because honestly I missed a lot and as of now I'm getting better, not a 100% better but there is progress, and I hope someone reading this long ass rant, would also get there :) because YOU ARE NOT ALONE  AND DESERVE HAPPINESS",1,1769845691.0,AlasFeels,1,1.0,False

I’m making sure that doesn't happen to you. (Taking 3 Clients),"A few weeks ago, my favorite local coffee roaster shut down.

They had the best beans I’ve ever tasted. The owner knew everything about roasting profiles. The shop was beautiful. But every time I walked in, it was empty. Their Instagram hadn't been updated in six months, and their ""marketing"" was just a chalkboard out front.

They died quietly. Not because their product was bad, but because they were **invisible**.

It frustrated the hell out of me. It made me realize that in 2026, **visibility isn't a luxury; it's oxygen.** If people can't find you, they can't pay you.

**The Problem with ""Social Media Experts""** I’ve spent the last year working in this space, and I see the same tragedy repeating itself. Business owners hire an ""expert"" or an agency. They pay ₹25,000 a month. And what do they get?

* Generic motivational quotes on Monday.
* ""Happy Diwali"" posts downloaded from Google Images.
* Zero comments. Zero traffic. Zero growth.

It’s hollow. It’s robotic. It’s burning money to look busy.

**Why I’m Going Solo** I decided to leave the agency grind because I was tired of the assembly line. I wanted to build actual **Growth Engines** for businesses that deserve to be seen.

I don't care about ""likes."" Likes are vanity. I care about **Business Growth**. I care about taking a stranger who has never heard of you, stopping their scroll, and guiding them to your website to make a purchase.

**My Philosophy: Traffic & Narrative** I view social media as a funnel, not a gallery.

1. **The Story (Visibility):** We don't just post ""content."" We tell the story of *why* you exist. We make you human. People buy from people, not logos.
2. **The System (Traffic):** I obsess over the mechanics. Where does the link go? Is the bio optimized? Is the Call-to-Action clear? If a post goes viral but nobody clicks the link, I consider that a failure.
3. **The Result (Growth):** Revenue. That’s the only metric that keeps the lights on.

**The Proposal** I am currently rebuilding my personal portfolio. I want to work with brands where I can point to the scoreboard and say, *""Look, I doubled their traffic in 90 days.""*

I am looking for **3 Indian Founders** who have a great product but are tired of being the ""best kept secret"" in their niche.

I am offering my full strategic attention—not an intern, not ChatGPT, but **me**—at a ""Portfolio Rate"" for the first 3 months.

**This is for you if:**

* You know your product is good, but your traffic is flat.
* You’re tired of ""posting into the void.""
* You want a partner who actually gives a damn about your P&L statement.

I’m not trying to sell you a package. I’m trying to stop another great business from staying invisible.

**If this resonates with you, let’s talk.** Drop a comment or DM me with a link to your current page. I’ll send you a free, honest breakdown of why you aren't growing and how we can fix it.

Till now I’ve been drinking Tata coffee (blue pack). It’s decent, but I wanted something richer and more interesting.

So I bought Blue Tokai Attikan Estate (pour over grind). The beans smell incredible, but I just cannot make a good cup. It’s consistently bitter and unpleasant.

This is my current method:
Boil water, let it cool for ~30 seconds
Place a Hario V60 paper filter on a cup, rinse the filter and cup with hot water
Add 3 tablespoons of coffee
Pour a small amount of water to bloom
After ~30 seconds, slowly pour water in circles
Total water used is around 200 ml

I’ve tried:
With milk (around 4 spoons)
Without milk
With and without sugar

Result is always the same: bitter and bad.
What confuses me is that the coffee smells so good before brewing, but tastes awful after.

Every time I ran my script, the model would hallucinate keys that didn't exist or ""helpfully"" truncate the data because it thought the list was too long. I tried everything to fix it—I tweaked the temperature up and down and even wrote a 500-word prompt explaining exactly why it shouldn't be ""helpful"".

By the four-hour mark, I was literally shouting at my IDE. My prompt was so bloated with ""DO NOT DO THIS"" and ""NEVER DO THAT"" that I think I actually confused the model into submission. It was outputting pure garbage, and I had one of those ""maybe I'm just not cut out for this"" moments. I finally walked away, grabbed a coffee, and realized I was treating the LLM like a disobedient child instead of a logic engine.

I went back, deleted the entire ""Rules"" section, and tried a different approach: I told the model to imagine it was a ""strict compiler"". I instructed it that if the input didn't map perfectly to the schema, it should return a null value and explain why in a separate log object—no apologies and no extra talk. I also added a ""Step 0"" where it had to generate a schema of the CSV before processing it.

It worked perfectly; 100/100 rows parsed with zero hallucinations. It’s a humbling reminder that in prompt engineering, ""more instructions"" usually just equals ""more noise"". Sometimes you have to strip away the ""human"" pleas and just give the model a persona that has no room for error.

# Prologue

Let me tell you a story…

Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Joy. She lived in a small town called New Salem in North Dakota. Her family wasn’t rich, but they weren’t considered poor either. Her parents were hardworking and religious folk and they were respected among the town’s people.

Her mother named her Joy because when she was born, she brought joy into their lives. Her mother and father had been trying so long to have a baby and when her mother became pregnant, her parents were so happy. Finally, after so many years of all the disappointments and false alarms, they were going to have a baby.

Joy’s mother had to stay in bed all throughout her pregnancy. There was a bit of bleeding during the first trimester, so the doctor ordered her mother to stay in bed. Her mother didn’t mind if she wasn’t allowed out of the house. She believed it was all for a good cause. Joy’s father hired someone else to help him at the small grocery store they owned in town and also hired some help around the house so Joy’s mother could take of herself and their baby. He’d do anything just as long as their little Joy came out healthy.

When Joy was born, her mother said she came out howling. She had strong lungs and the doctor said she was healthy as a horse. When the nurse came to her mother’s room so she could suckle, Joy’s cries were so loud, they could already hear her as the nurse came. But once Joy was in her mother’s arms, she quieted instantly, like she knew she belonged there. Her father brought all their friends to the hospital to come see Joy. He was so proud.

Joy grew up like any other little girl. Playing games with all her friends, riding her bike to the park, eating ice cream on a hot summer’s day and watching the stars on a clear starlit night. She was always full of energy. She could never sit still for a second…not even for the Taylor family’s annual Christmas photo they hand out to friends and family. Joy was always seen fidgeting, she could never keep still.

When it was time for Joy to go to school, she fit right in with all her peers. She was one of the brightest in her class and the students and teachers in the local grade school always fawned over her. She was a pretty little girl with chestnut colored hair and aquamarine colored eyes. There was usually an ongoing debate whether Joy’s eyes were green or blue. To stop the squabbling, her father would say everyone was right. He told them Joy’s eye color depended on the time of day. When it was bright, they were green. When it was dark, they were blue like the ocean.

Everything seemed fine for the Taylors until Joy entered high school. Sure, she was still one of the brightest in her class, but the students and teachers in the local high school no longer fawned over her. She was skinny, tall and awkward for a freshman while the other girls her age had nice perky breasts and were curvaceous. For the first time in her life, Joy became the butt of someone’s joke, the receiving end of a prank, a victim of a bully.

Joy would often wonder why did people need to undergo puberty as she’d stare at herself in the mirror before dressing for school. Everything was fine before high school. No one made fun of her, criticized her, or laughed at her. What was so special about breasts or sashaying hips?

Well, Joy didn’t mind just as long as her bestfriend, Noah, was beside her. When they were little, Noah’s family moved into a house along their cul-de-sac. He was shy and timid and had a stutter, but Joy didn’t mind. To her, Noah was special.

Noah was smaller than the average boy and he was picked on a lot. Joy would always defend him from the playground bullies, hold his hand when he was hurt, and shared everything of hers with him. They were two peas in a pod. Where one was, it was expected the other was there too. They only separated when they had to go home to sleep.

One night, when they were stargazing under the clear night sky on a picnic blanket at the meadow near Joy’s house, they made a pact that they would always be friends forever, no matter what. Noah smiled at her with that adorable toothless grin of his and hugged her real tight. Joy knew in her heart that Noah would never leave her. Not now, not ever.

But unlike Joy, who obviously was a late bloomer, Noah began to grow into the man he was destined to be during their freshmen year. He grew tall and his muscles started to form. He was no longer toothless and was blessed with perfect white teeth. His blonde hair shined like wheat in the sunlight and his chocolate brown eyes twinkled when he smiled. The freckles around the bridge of his nose gave him that manly charm. He even grew out of his stutter. When they walked through their school together, Noah in his favorite white T-shirt tucked in his ripped blue jeans, the girls would all sigh as he passed them.

Unfortunately, their friendship changed the summer before their sophomore year when Noah got a job flipping burgers at the local diner in town. He made friends with the kids who used to bully him in grade school. They were the popular kids in their high school and they believed Noah would be a good fit in their group. Yeah, they were all handsome and beautiful, some of them rich with powerful parents, and Noah knew being friends with them would give him an edge to get where he wanted to be in the future. He began ignoring Joy and brushing her off when she came to see him. It broke Joy’s heart. She understood people did change, but she couldn’t believe Noah, of all people, would hurt her.

During their sophomore year, Joy was now all alone. What was worse, Noah, who promised he would never leave her, began joining in on his friends’ fun of tormenting her every day. She would lock herself up in the girls’ bathroom and cry. She couldn’t believe her Noah could be so cruel!

Joy left town to visit her aunt, who lived in California, the summer before their junior year. When she came back, no one could recognize her. She had finally blossomed into a lady. Her once frizzy chestnut brown hair was now straight and curled at the ends. She now had big perky breasts and curves in all the right places. Since she was tall, her long legs gleamed like alabaster in the sunlight. Her braces were gone and she smiled so sweetly, showing off her perfect teeth through her perfect pink lips.

She was loved by all and she lived happily ever after…

Sorry, I was just fooling you. You know what they say, life is complicated.

And joy can turn into misery in a heartbeat.

It was one in the morning when the Taylors heard a knock on their door. It was the night of the spring dance and Joy had permission to sleep at a friend’s house after the event.

Joy’s father peered through the peep hole of the door and saw Noah standing at their doorstep.

“Noah, Joy isn’t here. She’s staying over at Lisa’s for the night,” Joy’s father said as he swung the door open, wearing a robe over his pajamas. His eyes widened when he saw Noah carrying a girl in his arms. Her unrecognizable face was covered with blood, her wrists and ankles had ligature marks, and her white dress was torn to reveal her naked, bruised and wounded body underneath. He recognized the white dress. It was the same dress Joy made for the spring dance. “OH MY GOD! JOY!”

Noah was crying and shaking terribly. “M-Mr. Taylor, can I bring Joy inside? I-I f-found her in the b-boy’s gym room tied up and badly hurt.”

“Give my daughter to me!” Joy’s father screamed. Noah gently placed Joy in her father’s arm, backed away and wiped his nose. “MARGARET! GET THE KEYS TO THE TRUCK! I NEED TO BRING JOY TO THE HOSPITAL!

Joy’s mother ran down the stairs of their two-storey home, completely confused. “Why do you need to bring Joy to-” She froze as she saw her bloodied daughter in her husband’s arms. “WHAT HAPPENED?! My baby! What happened to you?” Joy’s mother exclaimed as she rushed to her daughter, sobbing pitifully.

“Maggie, we need to bring Joy to the hospital. Grab my keys and my wallet and lock the door,” Joy’s father said calmly. Joy’s mother quickly grabbed the keys and her husband’s wallet from a tray on a small table in the foyer. “Noah, follow us in your car. I need you to tell the police what you know.”

At the hospital, the doctor gave the grim news to the Taylors that Joy was raped repeatedly. She also had broken ribs, trauma to her face and head, and a broken leg and arm. Whoever attacked her left her for dead.

When Noah talked to the police, he said he didn’t know anything and when the police visited the local high school, the kids didn’t want to talk. Instead, they said Joy was begging for it since she was wearing a backless white dress to the dance that left nothing to the imagination.

The boy’s gym was immaculate when the police searched the premises for evidence. They could not find any trace of hair, blood or semen. All they found was the smell of bleach.

Joy’s gown and sexual assault kit mysteriously went missing. Without any evidence, the Sheriff told Joy’s father they could not file charges. If they did go ahead and file charges, Joy would have to relive everything those boys did to her in front of so many people and if they lose the case, she would be branded as the town’s whore forever.

Joy didn’t return to school after she was discharged from the hospital and no one saw her after that. The Taylors sold everything and left, hoping to give Joy a chance at a normal life after her ordeal.

No one knew where they went and after ten long years, the Taylors were now just a mere memory in the small town of New Salem.

Well, not anymore.

# CHAPTER 1 The First Day-The Love of the Blood Disciples

*Joy*

I was staring at myself in the mirror when I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I was dressed in an ordinary gray hoodie paired with my favorite jeans and white sneakers. My long silky chestnut brown hair flowed freely below my shoulders, providing a suitable cover if ever I needed to hide my face.

I sighed. The idea was to blend in and not stand out, but I still had marks on my face which even make-up couldn’t hide.

It has been over a year, but I was far from calling myself fully recovered. There were still noticeable marks on my face, although I can say there has been a stark improvement.

At least I still had my aquamarine eyes. It was the only feature I had that I could still call beautiful.

“Sweetie, breakfast is ready,” my mom said, opening the door to my room. She was already dressed, ready to go to the hospital where she worked. She was wearing pink scrubs and white sneakers, her long brown hair was fixed into a neat bun while her face was devoid of make-up.

“Okay, Mom,” I said, taking one last look at myself in the mirror. It was my first day at university and I was nervous. Scratch that. I was absolutely freaking out!

Noticing my distress, my mom walked up to me and gave me reassuring hug.

“Honey, I know you’re nervous, but look how much you’ve improved. It has only been a little over a year and you’re looking like yourself again,” she said, peering into my eyes. “But if you aren’t ready, we can ask the dean to-”

“No, Mom. It’s now or never. I need to put high school behind me and move on or I’ll never be able to move on,” I said. “Anyway, I look so hideous, no boy is ever going to try and touch me. They’ll probably throw up at the mere thought.” The reassuring expression on my mom’s face instantly turned to sadness.

“Honey, I’m so sorry this had to happen to you, but look at the bright side, you’ve been given a second chance. Come on.” She put her arm around my shoulders and guided me to the door. “You don’t want to be late for your first day of school.”

I picked up my backpack and followed my mother to the kitchen. Since I still had problems going up and down the stairs, my parents made the small office space on the ground level of our small townhouse into my temporary bedroom.

“Here comes my college student. You got everything with you?” My Dad asked before taking a sip of his coffee.

“Yep,” I answered, making myself a bowl of cereal. My dad heard the nervousness in my voice and placed a loving hand on top of mine.

“Your mom and I, we are really proud of you, Joy. You’ve overcome so much so quickly. When I was your age, it took me a while to get myself together when your grandparents died.” My dad sighed and leaned back in his chair. “I wish things were different, but we need to deal with the cards we’ve been dealt with. All of us together.”

“I know, Dad. I wish things were different too. Don’t worry about me. I’ll be just fine,” I said before I began eating my cereal.

I glanced at my dad. He now had more white in his hair than ever before. He lost a ton of weight; his once round belly was much smaller, his face and arms much leaner. The stress of moving away from his home town and caring for his ‘brutally raped’ daughter showed.

“Since Mom has an early shift, I’ll be driving you to school,” my dad said, picking his keys up from the kitchen counter while I washed my empty cereal bowl.

“Sure, Dad.”

My anxiety grew as I sat quietly in the car while my dad drove me to school. I haven’t been out with students my age ever since my assault that night at the spring formal of my junior year in high school at New Salem, North Dakota. My parents and I moved to California after that in the hopes of a second chance in life.

I was homeschooled my senior year while I underwent a series of surgeries to restore my face. I actually felt like this massive science project every time I went under the knife. But after each surgery, I noticed there was a huge improvement from before which gave me hope. At least now, I can look at myself in the mirror and not gag from seeing my reflection.

My dad parked next to my building and gave me a kiss on my cheek. I gingerly exited his SUV, so I wouldn’t put too much pressure on my once broken leg. Although my leg was declared healed by my doctor, it still hurt a bit, so I walked with a slight limp. My doctor assured me it would go away in time and I will walk again like nothing ever happened.

“I’ll pick you up at this exact same spot, sweetie,” my dad called out to me from his car window.

“Sure, Dad. I’ll see you after class. Love you!” I said, waving goodbye.

I covered my head and my face with my hoodie before walking to my building. Although my face was improving, I was still self-conscious of my appearance. My cheeks were riddled with scars, blemishes and discolorations.

I know people would try and ask me what happened to me if they notice my face. And because I didn’t want to relive that particular moment in my life every single time I was asked, I decided it was best if I hide my face as much as I could.

As I walked along the campus sidewalk, I saw a group of students, hanging out near a big tree. There were three boys and two girls. One girl I remembered from my admissions interview. She was part of the student council who handled student affairs and helped faculty with admissions. As I passed by, the girl beside her called the attention of the three boys with them and pointed at me.

I know I should have looked away, but I couldn’t help, but stare. They were the most gorgeous young men I have ever seen in my life. If I had thought Noah was handsome, these guys were downright beautiful. I could think of no other word to describe them.

While that girl laughed at my appearance, the three boys looked at me with this horrible expression on their faces. I felt so embarrassed, I quickly looked away.

*Serves you right*, *Joy*. *You aren’t suppose to stare at people*. *It’s rude*.

I sighed. Well, at least I had something nice to look at on campus.

I walked into my building, found my room and picked a chair off to the corner where I could hide from everyone else. I made myself comfortable and waited for our professor to arrive.

More students began entering the classroom five minutes before class was expected to start. Our professor also walked in, briefcase and coffee in hand. He was a tall man with gray hair and glasses, looking quite tired. While I studied our professor, I didn’t notice the three boys behind him. Their eyes locked with mine as our professor walked quickly to his desk.

Oh my gosh! It was the three gorgeous boys from earlier! They were in my class!

All three of them were the same height, had the same dark hair and muscular build. I quickly assumed they were brothers because they resembled each other in a way.

But they had different colored eyes. One had startling blue eyes, the other had rare honey-colored eyes and the last one had light brown eyes, the color of dark caramel. Their parents must be really good-looking to have a brood of gorgeous men in the family.

The one with dark caramel eyes suddenly gave me a small smile. I quickly lowered my head, blushing.

*No*, *Joy*. *That smile wasn’t for you*.

I surreptitiously glanced upward to check if that smile was for me, but to my dismay, they had already taken their seats. I slowly turned my head to scan the people at the back, but I couldn’t find them.

I sighed. Well, it was time for me to focus on the lecture rather than boys. When I was in high school, I focused on boys during my junior year and look where it got me.

“Sebastian, will you please stop crowding me!” A deep manly voice growled right behind me.

I turned to look at who it was and I unexpectedly found the three of them seated behind me!

I quickly faced forward and sat up straight, deciding it was best to just look at my professor for the rest of the period.

But it was so hard to concentrate knowing they were seated behind me.",2,1769843804.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

# Prologue

Let me tell you a story…

Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Joy. She lived in a small town called New Salem in North Dakota. Her family wasn’t rich, but they weren’t considered poor either. Her parents were hardworking and religious folk and they were respected among the town’s people.

Her mother named her Joy because when she was born, she brought joy into their lives. Her mother and father had been trying so long to have a baby and when her mother became pregnant, her parents were so happy. Finally, after so many years of all the disappointments and false alarms, they were going to have a baby.

Joy’s mother had to stay in bed all throughout her pregnancy. There was a bit of bleeding during the first trimester, so the doctor ordered her mother to stay in bed. Her mother didn’t mind if she wasn’t allowed out of the house. She believed it was all for a good cause. Joy’s father hired someone else to help him at the small grocery store they owned in town and also hired some help around the house so Joy’s mother could take of herself and their baby. He’d do anything just as long as their little Joy came out healthy.

When Joy was born, her mother said she came out howling. She had strong lungs and the doctor said she was healthy as a horse. When the nurse came to her mother’s room so she could suckle, Joy’s cries were so loud, they could already hear her as the nurse came. But once Joy was in her mother’s arms, she quieted instantly, like she knew she belonged there. Her father brought all their friends to the hospital to come see Joy. He was so proud.

Joy grew up like any other little girl. Playing games with all her friends, riding her bike to the park, eating ice cream on a hot summer’s day and watching the stars on a clear starlit night. She was always full of energy. She could never sit still for a second…not even for the Taylor family’s annual Christmas photo they hand out to friends and family. Joy was always seen fidgeting, she could never keep still.

When it was time for Joy to go to school, she fit right in with all her peers. She was one of the brightest in her class and the students and teachers in the local grade school always fawned over her. She was a pretty little girl with chestnut colored hair and aquamarine colored eyes. There was usually an ongoing debate whether Joy’s eyes were green or blue. To stop the squabbling, her father would say everyone was right. He told them Joy’s eye color depended on the time of day. When it was bright, they were green. When it was dark, they were blue like the ocean.

Everything seemed fine for the Taylors until Joy entered high school. Sure, she was still one of the brightest in her class, but the students and teachers in the local high school no longer fawned over her. She was skinny, tall and awkward for a freshman while the other girls her age had nice perky breasts and were curvaceous. For the first time in her life, Joy became the butt of someone’s joke, the receiving end of a prank, a victim of a bully.

Joy would often wonder why did people need to undergo puberty as she’d stare at herself in the mirror before dressing for school. Everything was fine before high school. No one made fun of her, criticized her, or laughed at her. What was so special about breasts or sashaying hips?

Well, Joy didn’t mind just as long as her bestfriend, Noah, was beside her. When they were little, Noah’s family moved into a house along their cul-de-sac. He was shy and timid and had a stutter, but Joy didn’t mind. To her, Noah was special.

Noah was smaller than the average boy and he was picked on a lot. Joy would always defend him from the playground bullies, hold his hand when he was hurt, and shared everything of hers with him. They were two peas in a pod. Where one was, it was expected the other was there too. They only separated when they had to go home to sleep.

One night, when they were stargazing under the clear night sky on a picnic blanket at the meadow near Joy’s house, they made a pact that they would always be friends forever, no matter what. Noah smiled at her with that adorable toothless grin of his and hugged her real tight. Joy knew in her heart that Noah would never leave her. Not now, not ever.

But unlike Joy, who obviously was a late bloomer, Noah began to grow into the man he was destined to be during their freshmen year. He grew tall and his muscles started to form. He was no longer toothless and was blessed with perfect white teeth. His blonde hair shined like wheat in the sunlight and his chocolate brown eyes twinkled when he smiled. The freckles around the bridge of his nose gave him that manly charm. He even grew out of his stutter. When they walked through their school together, Noah in his favorite white T-shirt tucked in his ripped blue jeans, the girls would all sigh as he passed them.

Unfortunately, their friendship changed the summer before their sophomore year when Noah got a job flipping burgers at the local diner in town. He made friends with the kids who used to bully him in grade school. They were the popular kids in their high school and they believed Noah would be a good fit in their group. Yeah, they were all handsome and beautiful, some of them rich with powerful parents, and Noah knew being friends with them would give him an edge to get where he wanted to be in the future. He began ignoring Joy and brushing her off when she came to see him. It broke Joy’s heart. She understood people did change, but she couldn’t believe Noah, of all people, would hurt her.

During their sophomore year, Joy was now all alone. What was worse, Noah, who promised he would never leave her, began joining in on his friends’ fun of tormenting her every day. She would lock herself up in the girls’ bathroom and cry. She couldn’t believe her Noah could be so cruel!

Joy left town to visit her aunt, who lived in California, the summer before their junior year. When she came back, no one could recognize her. She had finally blossomed into a lady. Her once frizzy chestnut brown hair was now straight and curled at the ends. She now had big perky breasts and curves in all the right places. Since she was tall, her long legs gleamed like alabaster in the sunlight. Her braces were gone and she smiled so sweetly, showing off her perfect teeth through her perfect pink lips.

She was loved by all and she lived happily ever after…

Sorry, I was just fooling you. You know what they say, life is complicated.

And joy can turn into misery in a heartbeat.

It was one in the morning when the Taylors heard a knock on their door. It was the night of the spring dance and Joy had permission to sleep at a friend’s house after the event.

Joy’s father peered through the peep hole of the door and saw Noah standing at their doorstep.

“Noah, Joy isn’t here. She’s staying over at Lisa’s for the night,” Joy’s father said as he swung the door open, wearing a robe over his pajamas. His eyes widened when he saw Noah carrying a girl in his arms. Her unrecognizable face was covered with blood, her wrists and ankles had ligature marks, and her white dress was torn to reveal her naked, bruised and wounded body underneath. He recognized the white dress. It was the same dress Joy made for the spring dance. “OH MY GOD! JOY!”

Noah was crying and shaking terribly. “M-Mr. Taylor, can I bring Joy inside? I-I f-found her in the b-boy’s gym room tied up and badly hurt.”

“Give my daughter to me!” Joy’s father screamed. Noah gently placed Joy in her father’s arm, backed away and wiped his nose. “MARGARET! GET THE KEYS TO THE TRUCK! I NEED TO BRING JOY TO THE HOSPITAL!

Joy’s mother ran down the stairs of their two-storey home, completely confused. “Why do you need to bring Joy to-” She froze as she saw her bloodied daughter in her husband’s arms. “WHAT HAPPENED?! My baby! What happened to you?” Joy’s mother exclaimed as she rushed to her daughter, sobbing pitifully.

“Maggie, we need to bring Joy to the hospital. Grab my keys and my wallet and lock the door,” Joy’s father said calmly. Joy’s mother quickly grabbed the keys and her husband’s wallet from a tray on a small table in the foyer. “Noah, follow us in your car. I need you to tell the police what you know.”

At the hospital, the doctor gave the grim news to the Taylors that Joy was raped repeatedly. She also had broken ribs, trauma to her face and head, and a broken leg and arm. Whoever attacked her left her for dead.

When Noah talked to the police, he said he didn’t know anything and when the police visited the local high school, the kids didn’t want to talk. Instead, they said Joy was begging for it since she was wearing a backless white dress to the dance that left nothing to the imagination.

The boy’s gym was immaculate when the police searched the premises for evidence. They could not find any trace of hair, blood or semen. All they found was the smell of bleach.

Joy’s gown and sexual assault kit mysteriously went missing. Without any evidence, the Sheriff told Joy’s father they could not file charges. If they did go ahead and file charges, Joy would have to relive everything those boys did to her in front of so many people and if they lose the case, she would be branded as the town’s whore forever.

Joy didn’t return to school after she was discharged from the hospital and no one saw her after that. The Taylors sold everything and left, hoping to give Joy a chance at a normal life after her ordeal.

No one knew where they went and after ten long years, the Taylors were now just a mere memory in the small town of New Salem.

Well, not anymore.

*Joy*

I was staring at myself in the mirror when I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I was dressed in an ordinary gray hoodie paired with my favorite jeans and white sneakers. My long silky chestnut brown hair flowed freely below my shoulders, providing a suitable cover if ever I needed to hide my face.

I sighed. The idea was to blend in and not stand out, but I still had marks on my face which even make-up couldn’t hide.

At least I still had my aquamarine eyes. It was the only feature I had that I could still call beautiful.

“Sweetie, breakfast is ready,” my mom said, opening the door to my room. She was already dressed, ready to go to the hospital where she worked. She was wearing pink scrubs and white sneakers, her long brown hair was fixed into a neat bun while her face was devoid of make-up.

“Okay, Mom,” I said, taking one last look at myself in the mirror. It was my first day at university and I was nervous. Scratch that. I was absolutely freaking out!

Noticing my distress, my mom walked up to me and gave me reassuring hug.

“Honey, I know you’re nervous, but look how much you’ve improved. It has only been a little over a year and you’re looking like yourself again,” she said, peering into my eyes. “But if you aren’t ready, we can ask the dean to-”

“No, Mom. It’s now or never. I need to put high school behind me and move on or I’ll never be able to move on,” I said. “Anyway, I look so hideous, no boy is ever going to try and touch me. They’ll probably throw up at the mere thought.” The reassuring expression on my mom’s face instantly turned to sadness.

“Honey, I’m so sorry this had to happen to you, but look at the bright side, you’ve been given a second chance. Come on.” She put her arm around my shoulders and guided me to the door. “You don’t want to be late for your first day of school.”

I picked up my backpack and followed my mother to the kitchen. Since I still had problems going up and down the stairs, my parents made the small office space on the ground level of our small townhouse into my temporary bedroom.

Noah was crying and shaking terribly. “M-Mr. Taylor, can I bring Joy inside? I-I f-found her in the b-boy’s gym room tied up and badly hurt.”

“Give my daughter to me!” Joy’s father screamed. Noah gently placed Joy in her father’s arm, backed away and wiped his nose. “MARGARET! GET THE KEYS TO THE TRUCK! I NEED TO BRING JOY TO THE HOSPITAL!

Joy’s mother ran down the stairs of their two-storey home, completely confused. “Why do you need to bring Joy to-” She froze as she saw her bloodied daughter in her husband’s arms. “WHAT HAPPENED?! My baby! What happened to you?” Joy’s mother exclaimed as she rushed to her daughter, sobbing pitifully.

“Maggie, we need to bring Joy to the hospital. Grab my keys and my wallet and lock the door,” Joy’s father said calmly. Joy’s mother quickly grabbed the keys and her husband’s wallet from a tray on a small table in the foyer. “Noah, follow us in your car. I need you to tell the police what you know.”

At the hospital, the doctor gave the grim news to the Taylors that Joy was raped repeatedly. She also had broken ribs, trauma to her face and head, and a broken leg and arm. Whoever attacked her left her for dead.

When Noah talked to the police, he said he didn’t know anything and when the police visited the local high school, the kids didn’t want to talk. Instead, they said Joy was begging for it since she was wearing a backless white dress to the dance that left nothing to the imagination.

The boy’s gym was immaculate when the police searched the premises for evidence. They could not find any trace of hair, blood or semen. All they found was the smell of bleach.

Joy’s gown and sexual assault kit mysteriously went missing. Without any evidence, the Sheriff told Joy’s father they could not file charges. If they did go ahead and file charges, Joy would have to relive everything those boys did to her in front of so many people and if they lose the case, she would be branded as the town’s whore forever.

Joy didn’t return to school after she was discharged from the hospital and no one saw her after that. The Taylors sold everything and left, hoping to give Joy a chance at a normal life after her ordeal.

No one knew where they went and after ten long years, the Taylors were now just a mere memory in the small town of New Salem.

Well, not anymore.

# CHAPTER 1 The First Day-The Love of the Blood Disciples

*Joy*

I was staring at myself in the mirror when I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I was dressed in an ordinary gray hoodie paired with my favorite jeans and white sneakers. My long silky chestnut brown hair flowed freely below my shoulders, providing a suitable cover if ever I needed to hide my face.

I sighed. The idea was to blend in and not stand out, but I still had marks on my face which even make-up couldn’t hide.

It has been over a year, but I was far from calling myself fully recovered. There were still noticeable marks on my face, although I can say there has been a stark improvement.

At least I still had my aquamarine eyes. It was the only feature I had that I could still call beautiful.

“Sweetie, breakfast is ready,” my mom said, opening the door to my room. She was already dressed, ready to go to the hospital where she worked. She was wearing pink scrubs and white sneakers, her long brown hair was fixed into a neat bun while her face was devoid of make-up.

“Okay, Mom,” I said, taking one last look at myself in the mirror. It was my first day at university and I was nervous. Scratch that. I was absolutely freaking out!

Noticing my distress, my mom walked up to me and gave me reassuring hug.

“Honey, I know you’re nervous, but look how much you’ve improved. It has only been a little over a year and you’re looking like yourself again,” she said, peering into my eyes. “But if you aren’t ready, we can ask the dean to-”

“No, Mom. It’s now or never. I need to put high school behind me and move on or I’ll never be able to move on,” I said. “Anyway, I look so hideous, no boy is ever going to try and touch me. They’ll probably throw up at the mere thought.” The reassuring expression on my mom’s face instantly turned to sadness.

“Honey, I’m so sorry this had to happen to you, but look at the bright side, you’ve been given a second chance. Come on.” She put her arm around my shoulders and guided me to the door. “You don’t want to be late for your first day of school.”

I picked up my backpack and followed my mother to the kitchen. Since I still had problems going up and down the stairs, my parents made the small office space on the ground level of our small townhouse into my temporary bedroom.

“Here comes my college student. You got everything with you?” My Dad asked before taking a sip of his coffee.

“Yep,” I answered, making myself a bowl of cereal. My dad heard the nervousness in my voice and placed a loving hand on top of mine.

“Your mom and I, we are really proud of you, Joy. You’ve overcome so much so quickly. When I was your age, it took me a while to get myself together when your grandparents died.” My dad sighed and leaned back in his chair. “I wish things were different, but we need to deal with the cards we’ve been dealt with. All of us together.”

“I know, Dad. I wish things were different too. Don’t worry about me. I’ll be just fine,” I said before I began eating my cereal.

I glanced at my dad. He now had more white in his hair than ever before. He lost a ton of weight; his once round belly was much smaller, his face and arms much leaner. The stress of moving away from his home town and caring for his ‘brutally raped’ daughter showed.

“Since Mom has an early shift, I’ll be driving you to school,” my dad said, picking his keys up from the kitchen counter while I washed my empty cereal bowl.

“Sure, Dad.”

My anxiety grew as I sat quietly in the car while my dad drove me to school. I haven’t been out with students my age ever since my assault that night at the spring formal of my junior year in high school at New Salem, North Dakota. My parents and I moved to California after that in the hopes of a second chance in life.

I was homeschooled my senior year while I underwent a series of surgeries to restore my face. I actually felt like this massive science project every time I went under the knife. But after each surgery, I noticed there was a huge improvement from before which gave me hope. At least now, I can look at myself in the mirror and not gag from seeing my reflection.

My dad parked next to my building and gave me a kiss on my cheek. I gingerly exited his SUV, so I wouldn’t put too much pressure on my once broken leg. Although my leg was declared healed by my doctor, it still hurt a bit, so I walked with a slight limp. My doctor assured me it would go away in time and I will walk again like nothing ever happened.

“I’ll pick you up at this exact same spot, sweetie,” my dad called out to me from his car window.

“Sure, Dad. I’ll see you after class. Love you!” I said, waving goodbye.

I covered my head and my face with my hoodie before walking to my building. Although my face was improving, I was still self-conscious of my appearance. My cheeks were riddled with scars, blemishes and discolorations.

I know people would try and ask me what happened to me if they notice my face. And because I didn’t want to relive that particular moment in my life every single time I was asked, I decided it was best if I hide my face as much as I could.

As I walked along the campus sidewalk, I saw a group of students, hanging out near a big tree. There were three boys and two girls. One girl I remembered from my admissions interview. She was part of the student council who handled student affairs and helped faculty with admissions. As I passed by, the girl beside her called the attention of the three boys with them and pointed at me.

I know I should have looked away, but I couldn’t help, but stare. They were the most gorgeous young men I have ever seen in my life. If I had thought Noah was handsome, these guys were downright beautiful. I could think of no other word to describe them.

While that girl laughed at my appearance, the three boys looked at me with this horrible expression on their faces. I felt so embarrassed, I quickly looked away.

*Serves you right*, *Joy*. *You aren’t suppose to stare at people*. *It’s rude*.

I sighed. Well, at least I had something nice to look at on campus.

I walked into my building, found my room and picked a chair off to the corner where I could hide from everyone else. I made myself comfortable and waited for our professor to arrive.

More students began entering the classroom five minutes before class was expected to start. Our professor also walked in, briefcase and coffee in hand. He was a tall man with gray hair and glasses, looking quite tired. While I studied our professor, I didn’t notice the three boys behind him. Their eyes locked with mine as our professor walked quickly to his desk.

Oh my gosh! It was the three gorgeous boys from earlier! They were in my class!

All three of them were the same height, had the same dark hair and muscular build. I quickly assumed they were brothers because they resembled each other in a way.

But they had different colored eyes. One had startling blue eyes, the other had rare honey-colored eyes and the last one had light brown eyes, the color of dark caramel. Their parents must be really good-looking to have a brood of gorgeous men in the family.

The one with dark caramel eyes suddenly gave me a small smile. I quickly lowered my head, blushing.

*No*, *Joy*. *That smile wasn’t for you*.

I surreptitiously glanced upward to check if that smile was for me, but to my dismay, they had already taken their seats. I slowly turned my head to scan the people at the back, but I couldn’t find them.

I sighed. Well, it was time for me to focus on the lecture rather than boys. When I was in high school, I focused on boys during my junior year and look where it got me.

“Sebastian, will you please stop crowding me!” A deep manly voice growled right behind me.

I turned to look at who it was and I unexpectedly found the three of them seated behind me!

I quickly faced forward and sat up straight, deciding it was best to just look at my professor for the rest of the period.

But it was so hard to concentrate knowing they were seated behind me.",1,1769843732.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

When is the best time to visit **Bukidnon** if you want cool weather?

The short answer is December to February.  
The long answer is a bit more nuanced.

[Taken @ Coffee by the Ridge in Dahilayan, Bukidnon around 3PM ](https://preview.redd.it/jpkp5mwzwmgg1.jpeg?width=1279&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72df3ff801f9fddfd77ee18cfb4b869428c6c940)

Bukidnon, especially the higher areas like **Dahilayan,** is cool compared to most of Mindanao year round. Fog is not rare here. In fact, Dahilayan can fog up in almost any month, especially early mornings or after rain. So yes, you can technically experience fog even outside the colder months.

What changes during **December to February** is the intensity and consistency.

During these months, mornings are noticeably colder. Fog tends to be thicker and lingers longer. Sometimes visibility is low enough that drivers slow down significantly, especially before sunrise. The air feels heavier, damp, and quiet. Even after the fog lifts late morning, the temperature stays cool instead of turning warm by noon.

**January stands out the most.**  
This is when cold mornings feel routine rather than occasional. You wake up already feeling the chill. Jackets are practical, not just for photos. Evenings cool down fast, and the overall atmosphere feels slower and calmer.

**November and early March are transition months.**  
Mornings can still be cool and foggy, but the cold does not always last the whole day. By midday, the sun can already feel warm, especially in lower areas.

**April to May is a different story.**  
This is dry season. Dahilayan remains green and scenic, but the cool weather is mostly gone. Fog still happens sometimes, but it is thinner and clears quickly. Jackets become optional.

So if your main goal is cool weather, not just scenery or fog for photos, December to February is your best window. That is when Bukidnon, especially around Dahilayan and Manolo Fortich, feels the most comfortable, quiet, and balanced.

Living here, that is the season when the place feels the most like itself.",1,1769843522.0,DiscoverBukidnonPH,0,1.0,False

However, in the short term I’m looking for another job to keep me going until then. I have experience as both a speciality coffee barista and as a bartender.

I also hold professional coaching licenses for both tennis and squash, and would love to do more of this if I can find a good club for it.

1qrvkw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1qrvkw0/you_werent_supposed_to_learn_her_sunday_rules/,You Weren’t Supposed to Learn Her Sunday Rules,"I met Mara on a Tuesday, which mattered to her in a way I didn’t understand yet, because Tuesdays were for beginnings and Sundays were for maintenance, and she said that like a joke while stirring sugar into a paper cup of coffee she didn’t drink. 

Dating her felt normal in the every way, Target runs, cheap takeout, sitting in traffic complaining about people who didn’t know how to merge...but there was always this low static under everything, like the air before a storm that never quite arrives.

 She lived alone in a duplex that smelled faintly of lemon cleaner and old wood, and every time I stayed over Saturday night she reminded me, casually, like reminding someone to take their shoes off, that Sunday had rules.

She didn’t explain them all at once. She said that was dangerous.

The first Sunday I noticed something was off, she asked me not to wake her before 9:17 a.m. Not nine. Not nine-thirty. *Nine seventeen*. When my alarm went off earlier than that, she slapped it out of my hand without opening her eyes and whispered, *please don’t start the day wrong*. 

I laughed it off. Couples have quirks. But when 9:17 hit, she sat up fast, checked her phone, then smiled like someone who’d narrowly avoided missing a flight.

That morning she handed me a folded piece of notebook paper. “Just skim,” she said. “Don’t memorize.”

It was titled, in block letters, 

**SUNDAY RULES (TEMPORARY)**.

**1 Don’t ask about my childhood before noon.**  
**2 If you hear someone walking in the hallway, it’s not for us.**  
**3 Mirrors are fine, reflections aren’t.**  
**4 If I say ‘not today,’ you agree. No debate.**  
**5 Do not answer the door after the third knock.**

I made a joke about horror movies. She didn’t laugh. She took the paper back, folded it smaller, and slid it into a kitchen drawer already stuffed with other folded papers, different colors, different handwriting.

 I noticed then that the fridge had no photos. No magnets. Just a calendar with Sundays circled, some in red, some crossed out entirely.

Her friend Lila came over around noon, breezy, loud, hugged me like we’d met before. She asked how long I’d been “this version,” then corrected herself to *dating Mara*, and when Mara shot her a look, Lila mouthed sorry and went quiet.

 They argued later in the kitchen in whispers that kept slipping into my name, then stopping short like it burned. When I asked about it, Mara said, *Rule three*, and pointed at a mirror that had been turned face-down on the counter.

By the third Sunday, I started noticing inconsistencies. Mara said she hated eggs, but ate an omelet without comment. She said she’d never been to Chicago, then corrected me on a street name like muscle memory. 

Her ex, the one she said moved to Oregon, showed up in her phone contacts as “Do Not Answer,” but when I asked how long ago they broke up, she said *that depends on the rules that week*. I laughed again. I shouldn’t have.

The rules changed. That was the worst part.

**1 No photos before noon.**  
**2 if the lights flicker, hold my hand and don’t look at my face.**  
**3 We eat together or not at all.**  
**4 if I forget your name, don’t tell me.**

That last one sat in my head like a splinter. She never forgot my name. Not exactly. She hesitated sometimes, eyes unfocused, like she was flipping through cards. Once she called me Evan. Once she called me *please*. When I corrected her, she flinched and said, *you weren’t supposed to help*.

The hallway rule came into play the Sunday the footsteps stopped outside her door. Three knocks followed. Slow. Patient. Mara froze. Her grip on my wrist tightened until my fingers went numb. We waited.

 The knocks came again, softer, almost apologetic. I moved toward the door out of instinct and she shook her head hard enough to hurt herself. Later, she wrote a new rule and taped it inside the cabinet.

**If you think it’s for you, it definitely isn’t.**

Lila stopped coming over. When I asked why, Mara said Lila didn’t like the new schedule. She said that like it was a job. A rotation. I found a notebook one afternoon while Mara showered...didn’t read it, not really, just flipped and saw dates going back years. 

Sundays labeled with names. Some crossed out. Some circled twice. Some had notes like *too curious* or *stayed past dusk*. One page had my name, spelled wrong.

The next Sunday, Mara broke a rule herself. She looked at her reflection.

She screamed like she’d burned herself, slapped the mirror, turned it face-down, breathing hard. “We’re late,” she said. “We’re so late.” She handed me a new list, shorter, written in my handwriting.

I told her that wasn’t possible. She looked at me like I’d told her the sky was green.

**1 If you see your handwriting where it shouldn’t be, stop reading.**  
**2 If you remember writing rules, you’re already helping.**  
**3 Do not stay past sunset.**

Sunset came and went without either of us noticing. The hallway was quiet. Too quiet. No footsteps. No knocks. The calendar fell off the fridge on its own. All the Sundays were crossed out now.

Mara sat across from me at the table, calm in a way that didn’t fit her face. “You weren’t supposed to learn them,” she said gently. “You were supposed to follow.”

I asked her what happens when the rules run out.

She smiled, and for the first time, it didn’t reach her eyes. “They don’t,” she said. “They rotate.”

When I went to leave, my shoes weren’t by the door. The mirror in the hallway was standing upright again, reflecting a man who looked almost like me, a little taller, a little more certain. He raised his hand when I did. Behind him, Mara watched, holding a pen.

The last rule was already written.

**If he reads this, let him finish the story.**

I’m not sure what day it is anymore. The calendar won’t stay up. If this posts on a Sunday, don’t ask me questions before noon. 

If you hear someone walking in your hallway while you’re reading this, it’s not for you. And if you recognize the handwriting at the end...

Samples: Chanel No 5 L'eau, Lancome La vie est Belle, Givenchy L'interdit, YSL Black Opium Glitter, V&R Flowerbomb and Valentino Donna Born in Rome og.

Of the bottles I don't think I will repurchase them. I liked Guess more as I love cherry and I could smell the cherry in this one, but it's an edt and maybe not long lasting enough for me. Lacoste is also an edt and I got noseblind to it quickly after applying. It smelled really nice for the brief moment I could notice it. I think I would have loved this in my teens. Cute, but not for me.

Of the samples I could see myself maybe buying the YSL and Valentino (10ml penspray/30ml fb) some day, but right now I have 15 full bottles and 8 samples more to go through. I could not smell the Chanel properly either. I think it was beautiful but too mild even for an edt. La vie est belle and Flowerbomb were too heavy and L'interdit was too spicy, not for me. Valentino felt like an easy everyday reach, very nice. Soft, sweet and a little woody. 1-2 sprays is enough. I liked the coffee note in YSL Glitter.

I bought way too many (13) perfumes last year and this year I'm trying to not buy anymore and just use what I have. I think I should use up like 3 bottles before adding one to my collection. I like to have variety, but I've noticed that the amount that I have makes me a little anxious. Even the samples take time to get used up.

Maybe looking for some advice and validation. I (30F) feel lonely. About a year ago I moved across the country from Georgia to Oregon. It wasn’t for any specific reason or obligation other than I chance to shake things up and try something new. 

Life in Georgia was comfortable. I had my family, a solid group of friends I met in college, and I was building my career. And yet something felt off. I grew up there, went to college there, and spent my first few years as a young adult there. My job was draining me and when I got laid off, it felt like an opportunity to start a new chapter somewhere else. The hardest part was the idea of leaving my friends but even that felt necessary. It’s hard to explain, but my friend group did not have the best boundaries. We hung out a lot (multiple times a week) and I never felt like I had the opportunity to explore my own interests and “find myself” as an adult. My social life kinda felt like an extension of college for that reason. I’m also a creative person and for years felt so uninspired and disconnected from that part of myself. My partner felt the same lack of enthusiasm about where we lived and was equally amped at the idea of a new beginning. All this to say, a move felt like….the move! 

As background, my partner and I had visited the West Coast a number of times, visiting several different cities. We both fell in love with it! The cities, the food, the NATURE! It all felt so vibrant and lush! The culture of the West Coast also seemed to align better with who I am as a person than that of Georgia (I always felt like the black sheep there). We both yearned to get out here at some point and when my job came to a halt, we both knew it was time. Ultimately we landed on Oregon. 

Leading up to the move, so many serendipitous things kept happening and it truly felt like the universe was working for my good and validating this huge decision I had made! I got a job that agreed to let me work remotely so I wouldn’t have to stress about finding a job once I got to Oregon, we found an amazing apartment in our preferred neighborhood that was more spacious and cheaper that our old one, I learned my old professor had moved out here and they offered to help me find a local job when I was ready, my partner was even able to keep their job remotely (which we never thought was possible). Overall I felt great entering this new chapter and I just knew things were going to work out! This was when my life would really begin! 

Fast forward to now and I’m a couple weeks away from hitting the first year mark and I just feel….lonely. Things could be so much worse and I need to keep that in perspective, but it’s just been hard to feel like everything is clicking. Finding community has been hard and I have tried putting myself out there in so many ways. I attend social events, joined clubs/workshops, go to neighborhood events, professional networking, even joined a board! But even still, I’m not making as many connections as I would have hoped. I find myself feeling so awkward and self conscious. Every event I go to I walk away feeling anxious and insecure, overthinking everything I did and said. The few connections I have made feel so surface level, which I know is to be expected, but still makes me sad. 

Working remotely does not help. I’m grateful to have a job, but I’m sick of being in my house all day. I can’t exactly work from a coffee shop bc I have the kind of job where I need 3 computer screens. I work in a creative field that I’m actually really passionate about, but it’s so hard to feel connected to the work when I’m not able to be as hands on. I know I need to find a new job in person, but I’m close to getting a promotion and logically it makes sense to wait so I can enter the job market at a higher paid position. I’m also feeling pretty unmotivated to start the job search because I’m feeling so overwhelmed in other aspects of life. 

At this point I’m living for the weekends, but even then, I feel like 99% of the time I’m only with my partner and our relationship is taking a toll. We both take our frustrations out on each other and have become super codependent (particularly me). All of this is causing my mental and physical health to decline. When I talk to my friends and family back home, my heart just breaks because I miss them so much. I often wonder if I made a mistake uprooting myself. My partner has settled much more seamlessly (other than the fact that we spend way too much time together). I think part of the reason is because they are more introverted than me and feel satisfied exploring their hobbies at home. I feel jealous that I can’t feel as content when I wanted this so badly. 

We visited Georgia over Christmas and it felt so good to connect with our people. We visited our old neighborhood and I was so curious to see how I felt. Overall, I was surprised that I didn’t seem to miss the place at all! It made me realize it’s really only the people I miss. In contrast, here I feel so much more connected to the place (I absolutely love our neighborhood/access to nature), but don’t have the people connections I need to thrive. 

Just feeling lonely and doubting my decision. I’m hoping I just need more time. I’m willing to let the seeds I’ve planted grow, but just need some encouragement while I wait. Let me know if you have had a similar experience and if you felt the wait was worth it.",1,1769843027.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

Too much setup

Bank sync breaking or feeling unsafe

Cloud storage I don’t fully trust

Features I don’t use, and missing ones I actually need

Lately I’ve been wondering:

What would a budgeting app look like if it worked fully offline and actually felt simple?

I’m currently exploring an offline AI budgeting app

where:

Everything stays on the device

No bank sync, no cloud, no signup

You can add expenses naturally (like typing “Coffee $15”)

There’s a small, clean dashboard instead of complex charts

But before going any further, I genuinely want to ask this community:

If you could design your ideal budgeting app, what features would you really want?

Especially things you feel current apps get wrong or overcomplicate.

I have depression maybe melancholy too and possibly autism as an autism psychologist with 20 years of expertise in autism&adhd has told me. Maybe this is why what i am going to ask will be maybe easily solved by neurotypically developed people. A coworker had asked me out through my other coworker to go out for a coffee. I hesitated and pretended to not care enough. I think i had told her that i don't believe her or that i don't want to go out. I was hesitant. I texted her the same or the next day and we would go out for a coffee but after some hours before going out i told her that i am anxious going out and that if i had my own home i would have invited her to come and i told her maybe i should go to her home since going out made me anxious. She accepted by telling me that i could go to her house since her boyfriend was at work those hours. maybe it was true maybe it was lie but they broke up some 1-2 months after that so the relationahip was not going great i guess thoat time. I told her that since she has a bf that we should not go out. She responded by saying that she understands. Unfortunately i texted her again some hours llater after that and 3 more times in the span of 3 months approximately. At the work she never seemed and never seems to be bothered by how i interacted with her through the mesaages. Contrary she has begun calling me Danny instead of daniel sometimes, though it is not my real name but she calls me like when lovers call eatch other. I only talk to her when she tells me hi or how i am doing. Maybe she is just a kind human but in my mind she wants me to begin making conversations. The problem is that i don't feel starting conversations. I gather dishes do laundry in the mcdonalds type restaurant watch the toilets if they are clean etc. so i don't have time to talk to her and i also get tired and angry because of my work so there is no way for me to relax and talk to her. She sees that i am angry and tired, she even asked me if someone hurt me. The messages that i had texted her though, those 3, they were only read and never answered so am i maybe thinking delusionally?  ",1,1769842544.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Chapter **1** 

Shannon Bradley **stayed** up all **night** on her birthday, waiting for her fiancé, Nicholas Hickman, but he never returned 

He’d gone to stop **his** one true love, Courtney Harvey, from marrying a notorious New York playboy–because **to him, that** marriage would be hell for her. 

Shannon sat **in** the **living** room all night with swollen eyes. At dawn, her phone rang. It was an **unfamiliar number** 

“**Shannon**, **marry me**,” the man said. 

At that careless, offhand tone, Shannon immediately pictured his roguish, devil–may–care grin. 

It was Benjamin Blevins, the man Courtney was supposed to marry today. 

“Benjamin?” 

“Your fiancé stole my bride.” Benjamin said with a lazy laugh. “So I’ll steal his future bride instead. Sounds fair**,** right?” 

Shannon was silent for a moment, then nodded her head slightly. “Yeah.” 

On the other end, Benjamin raised an eyebrow, his tone firm and self–assured. “Good. The wedding is in fifteen days. Get your dress ready–I’ll come get you.” 

The call ended. 

Shannon stared at the cold dishes spread across the table, and suddenly her eyes welled up with

She’d waited years for Nicholas to propose–only to accept another man’s proposal and marry 

Ten years ago, Shannon met Nicholas at freshman orientation and fell for him at first sight. 

Introducing himself in the school’s blue–and–white uniform, he looked effortlessly handsome at the time. Sunlight poured through the tall auditorium windows, casting a faint golden glow around his sharp profile. Girls in the crowd whispered excitedly, their faces flushed as they secretly snapped photos.

she had just received. 

Back then, Nicholas was the golden boy of the school.

Consistently ranked first in every exam and sweeping up gold at every Math Olympiad, he was the definition of brilliance. 

He was just as skilled at sports, playing basketball with effortless finesse. Every move he made exuded the quiet, refined elegance of someone from old money. 

She was merely a scholarship student, a girl from an ordinary world that stood in stark contrast to 

his. 

Though every girl in school adored him, his eyes never rested on any of them. 

They were always on Courtney, the girl he’d grown up with. 

Shannon had seen him organizing notes for Courtney in the library and taking off his jacket to shield her from the rain. She had also seen him run all over the city just to find the limited–edition CD Courtney had casually mentioned. 

Later, she heard their families were close and that their engagement had been decided long ago. 

But everything changed that summer, right after the SAT, when the Hickman Group’s sudden collapse dominated the financial headlines. 

Nicholas‘ father, Frederick Hickman, who once drove a Rolls–Royce to school meetings, jumped from the company building. The next day, Courtney flew to the UK. Nicholas was left alone, buried under crushing debt, drifting from job to job, exhausted and broken. 

That night, Shannon found him drunk outside a bar. 

He looked like a total mess–his expensive shirt wrinkled and hanging loosely on him, his eyes bloodshot. 

She crouched down to help him up, but he suddenly grabbed her wrist. The reek of alcohol mixed with blood hit her in the face as he slurred, “Who are you?” 

“Shannon,” she said softly. “We went to the same school, but you probably don’t remember me 

She was right–he didn’t remember her. But he still let her take him home. 

That night, Nicholas was completely out of control. He pinned her to the narrow bed in her tiny apartment and kissed her until her lips went numb

Later, she found out that half an hour before she found him, Courtney had posted a photo online. 

In it, she was kissing her new boyfriend under the Eiffel Tower. 

The next morning, Nicholas promised to take care of Shannon. 

He moved into her tiny apartment, barely twenty square meters. They got through the hardest days together, leaning on each other. 

But Shannon knew that his heart had never belonged to her, even though they were in a relationship. 

He was still in love with Courtney. 

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, she would wake to see him staring at old photos of Courtney on his phone. She knew he’d live on frozen pizzas for three months just to save up for a plane ticket to Paris. On Shannon’s birthday, when Courtney texted him, he rushed out without a second thought. 

Still, Shannon refused to give up. 

She stayed up late helping him perfect his résumé, accompanied him to submit applications at various companies, and stood by him when debt collectors came after them. During their hardest times, she secretly sold her emerald bracelet, the only keepsake from her mother, just to buy him a proper suit for job interviews. 

Slowly, things began to change. He remembered that she liked two tablespoons of sugar in her coffee, reminded her to eat when she worked late, and draped a jacket over her shoulders when she fell asleep. 

She thought she had finally won his heart. 

And he made his comeback. Once again, he was the celebrated heir everyone wanted to be near. 

And just as life seemed to be turning around, Courtney returned. 

Everything reset. 

Nicholas sped to the airport late at night to pick up Courtney and threw her a welcome party, as it the painful past, when she had left him, never existed. And when he heard she was getting married, he didn’t hesitate for a second to try to stop it. 

For the past seven years, Shannon had given him everything she had–only for him to run to Courtney the minute she returned.

Shannon stood up and began packing. She threw everything into trash bags.

The rumble of the garbage truck filled the air. She walked out and stood there, watching the men toss those bags into the back–throwing away seven years of her foolish devotion. 

Not long after she went back in, the front door burst open. 

“What did you throw out?” Nicholas asked behind her. 

She didn’t turn around. Her voice was calm as she said, “Some useless things.” 

Then, she looked back at him and continued, “I was just cleaning–getting rid of things I don’t need. 

Nicholas‘ expression changed instantly. He shoved past her and rushed inside. 

“How dare you touch my things?” 

He tore through the house, his face growing darker by the second. 

When he couldn’t find what he was looking for in the study, he bolted out the door. 

As he moved past, he knocked Shannon to the side. 

She stumbled, her forehead slamming into the doorframe. Blood streamed down immediately 

Worried she had really thrown out something important, she didn’t even treat the wound before chasing after him. 

Then she saw something she would never forget. 

Nicholas, suffering from severe germophobia, was kneeling in the trash, frantically digging through it. 

Guilt surged in her chest. She hurried to explain, “The trash has already been taken away. You’ll have to go to the landfill to find it. I only threw out my own things. I might have mixed yours up by accident. I’m sorry.” 

Only then did Nicholas notice her injury. 

He froze for a moment, reached out as if to touch her, then pulled his hand back. “I was in a hurry just now, so I didn’t notice.” 

After they got into the car, Shannon finally couldn’t hold it in anymore. “What did you lose? Is it

Nicholas tightened his grip on the steering wheel. After a long pause, he told her it was an emerald pendant he had been having cleaned and maintained for years. 

Shannon’s heart jolted violently, tears rushing to her eyes. 

The emerald pendant was a gift from Courtney at their engagement.

Chapter **1** 

Shannon Bradley **stayed** up all **night** on her birthday, waiting for her fiancé, Nicholas Hickman, but he never returned 

He’d gone to stop **his** one true love, Courtney Harvey, from marrying a notorious New York playboy–because **to him, that** marriage would be hell for her. 

Shannon sat **in** the **living** room all night with swollen eyes. At dawn, her phone rang. It was an **unfamiliar number** 

“**Shannon**, **marry me**,” the man said. 

At that careless, offhand tone, Shannon immediately pictured his roguish, devil–may–care grin. 

It was Benjamin Blevins, the man Courtney was supposed to marry today. 

“Benjamin?” 

“Your fiancé stole my bride.” Benjamin said with a lazy laugh. “So I’ll steal his future bride instead. Sounds fair**,** right?” 

Shannon was silent for a moment, then nodded her head slightly. “Yeah.” 

On the other end, Benjamin raised an eyebrow, his tone firm and self–assured. “Good. The wedding is in fifteen days. Get your dress ready–I’ll come get you.” 

The call ended. 

Shannon stared at the cold dishes spread across the table, and suddenly her eyes welled up with 

tears. 

him. 

She’d waited years for Nicholas to propose–only to accept another man’s proposal and marry 

Ten years ago, Shannon met Nicholas at freshman orientation and fell for him at first sight. 

Introducing himself in the school’s blue–and–white uniform, he looked effortlessly handsome at the time. Sunlight poured through the tall auditorium windows, casting a faint golden glow around his sharp profile. Girls in the crowd whispered excitedly, their faces flushed as they secretly snapped photos. 

Shannon stood in the shadows at the very back of the hall, fingers clenched around the student ID

she had just received. 

Back then, Nicholas was the golden boy of the school. 

11 

Consistently ranked first in every exam and sweeping up gold at every Math Olympiad, he was the definition of brilliance. 

He was just as skilled at sports, playing basketball with effortless finesse. Every move he made exuded the quiet, refined elegance of someone from old money. 

She was merely a scholarship student, a girl from an ordinary world that stood in stark contrast to 

his. 

Though every girl in school adored him, his eyes never rested on any of them. 

They were always on Courtney, the girl he’d grown up with. 

Shannon had seen him organizing notes for Courtney in the library and taking off his jacket to shield her from the rain. She had also seen him run all over the city just to find the limited–edition CD Courtney had casually mentioned. 

Later, she heard their families were close and that their engagement had been decided long ago. 

But everything changed that summer, right after the SAT, when the Hickman Group’s sudden collapse dominated the financial headlines. 

Nicholas‘ father, Frederick Hickman, who once drove a Rolls–Royce to school meetings, jumped from the company building. The next day, Courtney flew to the UK. Nicholas was left alone, buried under crushing debt, drifting from job to job, exhausted and broken. 

That night, Shannon found him drunk outside a bar. 

He looked like a total mess–his expensive shirt wrinkled and hanging loosely on him, his eyes bloodshot. 

She crouched down to help him up, but he suddenly grabbed her wrist. The reek of alcohol mixed with blood hit her in the face as he slurred, “Who are you?” 

“Shannon,” she said softly. “We went to the same school, but you probably don’t remember me 

She was right–he didn’t remember her. But he still let her take him home. 

That night, Nicholas was completely out of control. He pinned her to the narrow bed in her tiny apartment and kissed her until her lips went numb

Later, she found out that half an hour before she found him, Courtney had posted a photo online. 

In it, she was kissing her new boyfriend under the Eiffel Tower. 

The next morning, Nicholas promised to take care of Shannon. 

He moved into her tiny apartment, barely twenty square meters. They got through the hardest days together, leaning on each other. 

But Shannon knew that his heart had never belonged to her, even though they were in a relationship. 

He was still in love with Courtney. 

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, she would wake to see him staring at old photos of Courtney on his phone. She knew he’d live on frozen pizzas for three months just to save up for a plane ticket to Paris. On Shannon’s birthday, when Courtney texted him, he rushed out without a second thought. 

Still, Shannon refused to give up. 

She stayed up late helping him perfect his résumé, accompanied him to submit applications at various companies, and stood by him when debt collectors came after them. During their hardest times, she secretly sold her emerald bracelet, the only keepsake from her mother, just to buy him a proper suit for job interviews. 

Slowly, things began to change. He remembered that she liked two tablespoons of sugar in her coffee, reminded her to eat when she worked late, and draped a jacket over her shoulders when she fell asleep. 

She thought she had finally won his heart. 

And he made his comeback. Once again, he was the celebrated heir everyone wanted to be near. 

And just as life seemed to be turning around, Courtney returned. 

Everything reset. 

Nicholas sped to the airport late at night to pick up Courtney and threw her a welcome party, as it the painful past, when she had left him, never existed. And when he heard she was getting married, he didn’t hesitate for a second to try to stop it. 

For the past seven years, Shannon had given him everything she had–only for him to run to Courtney the minute she returned.

She was exhausted, the well of her devotion had run dry. 

Shannon stood up and began packing. She threw everything into trash bags.

The rumble of the garbage truck filled the air. She walked out and stood there, watching the men toss those bags into the back–throwing away seven years of her foolish devotion. 

Not long after she went back in, the front door burst open. 

“What did you throw out?” Nicholas asked behind her. 

She didn’t turn around. Her voice was calm as she said, “Some useless things.” 

Then, she looked back at him and continued, “I was just cleaning–getting rid of things I don’t need. 

Nicholas‘ expression changed instantly. He shoved past her and rushed inside. 

“How dare you touch my things?” 

He tore through the house, his face growing darker by the second. 

When he couldn’t find what he was looking for in the study, he bolted out the door. 

As he moved past, he knocked Shannon to the side. 

She stumbled, her forehead slamming into the doorframe. Blood streamed down immediately 

Worried she had really thrown out something important, she didn’t even treat the wound before chasing after him. 

Then she saw something she would never forget. 

Nicholas, suffering from severe germophobia, was kneeling in the trash, frantically digging through it. 

Guilt surged in her chest. She hurried to explain, “The trash has already been taken away. You’ll have to go to the landfill to find it. I only threw out my own things. I might have mixed yours up by accident. I’m sorry.” 

Only then did Nicholas notice her injury. 

He froze for a moment, reached out as if to touch her, then pulled his hand back. “I was in a hurry just now, so I didn’t notice.” 

After they got into the car, Shannon finally couldn’t hold it in anymore. “What did you lose? Is it

Every time I ran my script, the model would hallucinate keys that didn't exist or ""helpfully"" truncate the data because it thought the list was too long. I tried everything to fix it—I tweaked the temperature up and down and even wrote a 500-word prompt explaining exactly why it shouldn't be ""helpful"".

By the four-hour mark, I was literally shouting at my IDE. My prompt was so bloated with ""DO NOT DO THIS"" and ""NEVER DO THAT"" that I think I actually confused the model into submission. It was outputting pure garbage, and I had one of those ""maybe I'm just not cut out for this"" moments. I finally walked away, grabbed a coffee, and realized I was treating the LLM like a disobedient child instead of a logic engine.

I went back, deleted the entire ""Rules"" section, and tried a different approach: I told the model to imagine it was a ""strict compiler"". I instructed it that if the input didn't map perfectly to the schema, it should return a null value and explain why in a separate log object—no apologies and no extra talk. I also added a ""Step 0"" where it had to generate a schema of the CSV before processing it.

It worked perfectly; 100/100 rows parsed with zero hallucinations. It’s a humbling reminder that in prompt engineering, ""more instructions"" usually just equals ""more noise"". Sometimes you have to strip away the ""human"" pleas and just give the model a persona that has no room for error.

# Chapter 1

I’d spent days meticulously planning our wedding, while Lorenzo just wanted a simple ceremony with close friends.

That afternoon, while he was at his bachelor party, I went to his study to find our wedding invitations.

I found a strange envelope among his documents.

A marriage certificate, wedding photos, and property transfer documents scattered before me.

In the photo, a beautiful brunette in a white dress smiled radiantly beside Lorenzo in his black tuxedo.

My fiancé.

The certificate read: Lorenzo Moretti and Elena Rossi, dated six years ago.

Six years ago—but we’d only been together for five years.

This meant…

I grabbed the wedding photo and rushed downstairs.

“Come look at what I found!” I called out, bursting into the living room.

Lorenzo’s men were gathered around him, whiskey glasses in hand. They all stopped talking when they saw me.

“I was looking for our wedding invitations and found this instead.” I held up the wedding photo.

Marco immediately tried to snatch the photo away. “Don, this…”

“Damn, how did Elena’s photo end up here?” Tony blurted out.

“Tony, shut up!” another man quickly interrupted.

Elena. So her name was Elena.

“So you all know about her?” My voice began to shake as I clutched the marriage certificate. “You all know he has a wife?”

Silence.

“Everyone out,” Lorenzo said calmly.

His men quietly filed out, leaving Lorenzo and me face to face.

“Shouldn’t you explain what the hell this is?” I slammed the marriage certificate against his chest.

Five years. I’d been an intruder for five years.

Lorenzo waved his hand dismissively. “Ava, it’s just a piece of paper.”

He approached me with complete composure, as if we were discussing what to have for dinner.

“Elena is only my wife on paper.” He stepped closer to me. “Her late father left her in my care. I have to protect her. This is just an alliance between two families.”

“A family alliance?” I stepped back, feeling something breaking in my chest. “Then why didn’t you tell me? Five years, Lorenzo!”

“Because it’s about responsibility. I love you, but I can’t abandon Elena.” His tone became righteous, as if I were the unreasonable one. “I thought a smart woman would understand—”

“Understand what?” My voice rose. “Understand how to be a competent mistress?”

“Don’t say that,” he frowned, his tone reproachful. “The life I’ve given you, the protection I provide – it’s more than most women could ever dream of. You should be grateful.”

“Grateful?” I angrily pulled my hand away. “Lorenzo, listen to what you’re saying!”

“Then what exactly do you want?” he asked coldly. “You want me to go divorce Elena right now? Destroy the alliance between two families? Start a war?”

I looked at him standing there, tall and sharp in his tailored suit.

The same man I’d loved for five years.

But now, the coldness in his eyes made my blood run cold.

“You’re being too extreme. After the wedding, you’ll be my woman. My children will only come from you.”

His tone sounded like he was making some kind of concession, some kind of charity.

That’s why he wanted a simple wedding and never brought me to meet his parents.

“Get out!”

Lorenzo paused. “Ava…”

“I said get out!”

Rage erupted like a volcano. I grabbed the crystal glass from the coffee table and hurled it at the wall with all my strength.

Glass exploded behind him, shards flying everywhere, one piece cutting across my palm. Blood dripped onto their wedding photo.

“You’re crazy!” Lorenzo rushed over to check my wound.

“Don’t touch me!” I pushed him away. “Five years, Lorenzo! I was unknowingly your mistress for five years!”

My voice grew louder and louder, tears streaming down my cheeks.

Just then, Lorenzo’s phone rang.

He glanced at the screen and declined it.

It rang again. Declined again.

When it rang a third time, he finally answered.

Soft, broken crying came through the phone.

“Lorenzo… I feel terrible… can you come see me…”

Lorenzo rubbed his temples. “Alright, I’ll be right there.”

He hung up and turned to me, trying to explain, “Ava, she’s always been sickly—”

I said nothing, just looked at him.

This scene had played out countless times over the past five years.

His phone always rang at the most critical moments.

And I was always the understanding one, saying, “Go handle it first.”

Now I realized that those nights when he hurriedly got dressed and left, those weekends when he canceled our plans for “urgent business”—some of those times were spent with his real wife.

“Lorenzo,” I called out to him.

He stopped but didn’t turn around.

“If you dare to leave, we’re completely done!”

One second, two seconds, three seconds.

“I’ll be back soon.”

Then I heard the door close.

My hand resting on my lower abdomen trembled slightly.

Inside, there was the surprise I’d planned to tell him about today…",1,1769841810.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

Lorenzo waved his hand dismissively. “Ava, it’s just a piece of paper.”

He approached me with complete composure, as if we were discussing what to have for dinner.

“Elena is only my wife on paper.” He stepped closer to me. “Her late father left her in my care. I have to protect her. This is just an alliance between two families.”

“A family alliance?” I stepped back, feeling something breaking in my chest. “Then why didn’t you tell me? Five years, Lorenzo!”

“Because it’s about responsibility. I love you, but I can’t abandon Elena.” His tone became righteous, as if I were the unreasonable one. “I thought a smart woman would understand—”

“Understand what?” My voice rose. “Understand how to be a competent mistress?”

“Don’t say that,” he frowned, his tone reproachful. “The life I’ve given you, the protection I provide – it’s more than most women could ever dream of. You should be grateful.”

“Grateful?” I angrily pulled my hand away. “Lorenzo, listen to what you’re saying!”

“Then what exactly do you want?” he asked coldly. “You want me to go divorce Elena right now? Destroy the alliance between two families? Start a war?”

I looked at him standing there, tall and sharp in his tailored suit.

The same man I’d loved for five years.

But now, the coldness in his eyes made my blood run cold.

“You’re being too extreme. After the wedding, you’ll be my woman. My children will only come from you.”

His tone sounded like he was making some kind of concession, some kind of charity.

That’s why he wanted a simple wedding and never brought me to meet his parents.

“Get out!”

Lorenzo paused. “Ava…”

“I said get out!”

Rage erupted like a volcano. I grabbed the crystal glass from the coffee table and hurled it at the wall with all my strength.

Glass exploded behind him, shards flying everywhere, one piece cutting across my palm. Blood dripped onto their wedding photo.

“You’re crazy!” Lorenzo rushed over to check my wound.

“Don’t touch me!” I pushed him away. “Five years, Lorenzo! I was unknowingly your mistress for five years!”

My voice grew louder and louder, tears streaming down my cheeks.

Just then, Lorenzo’s phone rang.

He glanced at the screen and declined it.

It rang again. Declined again.

When it rang a third time, he finally answered.

Soft, broken crying came through the phone.

“Lorenzo… I feel terrible… can you come see me…”

Lorenzo rubbed his temples. “Alright, I’ll be right there.”

He hung up and turned to me, trying to explain, “Ava, she’s always been sickly—”

I said nothing, just looked at him.

This scene had played out countless times over the past five years.

His phone always rang at the most critical moments.

And I was always the understanding one, saying, “Go handle it first.”

Now I realized that those nights when he hurriedly got dressed and left, those weekends when he canceled our plans for “urgent business”—some of those times were spent with his real wife.

“Lorenzo,” I called out to him.

He stopped but didn’t turn around.

“If you dare to leave, we’re completely done!”

# Chapter 1

I’d spent days meticulously planning our wedding, while Lorenzo just wanted a simple ceremony with close friends.

That afternoon, while he was at his bachelor party, I went to his study to find our wedding invitations.

I found a strange envelope among his documents.

A marriage certificate, wedding photos, and property transfer documents scattered before me.

In the photo, a beautiful brunette in a white dress smiled radiantly beside Lorenzo in his black tuxedo.

My fiancé.

The certificate read: Lorenzo Moretti and Elena Rossi, dated six years ago.

Six years ago—but we’d only been together for five years.

This meant…

I grabbed the wedding photo and rushed downstairs.

“Come look at what I found!” I called out, bursting into the living room.

Lorenzo’s men were gathered around him, whiskey glasses in hand. They all stopped talking when they saw me.

“I was looking for our wedding invitations and found this instead.” I held up the wedding photo.

Marco immediately tried to snatch the photo away. “Don, this…”

“Damn, how did Elena’s photo end up here?” Tony blurted out.

“Tony, shut up!” another man quickly interrupted.

Elena. So her name was Elena.

“So you all know about her?” My voice began to shake as I clutched the marriage certificate. “You all know he has a wife?”

Silence.

“Everyone out,” Lorenzo said calmly.

His men quietly filed out, leaving Lorenzo and me face to face.

“Shouldn’t you explain what the hell this is?” I slammed the marriage certificate against his chest.

Five years. I’d been an intruder for five years.

Lorenzo waved his hand dismissively. “Ava, it’s just a piece of paper.”

The night I danced with her, held her hand, and looked into her eyes, something inside me changed. I felt something I had never felt before.

I’ve asked God why He would put someone like that in my life only for her to break my heart. I tried therapy. I tried getting closer to God. But honestly, I feel lost. I haven’t really left the house in months because I’m afraid I’ll run into her and reopen wounds that haven’t healed yet. I’m afraid I’ll see her with someone else. I didn’t want it to end. Especially not like this.

I can’t even watch movies anymore because everything reminds me of her. I wake up thinking about her. I dream about her. At night, every song brings her back. Even though I know, logically, that it was probably better for her to leave, every day for the past six months has been a struggle. I’m scared I’ll never forget her.

I’ve tried going out and meeting other women, but I feel numb. Nothing really brings me happiness anymore. Sometimes it’s just a quick trip to the coffee shop or buying things I don’t need online. Anything to distract myself. But the thoughts always come back. And I don’t know how to make them stop.

I feel like I’ve wasted so much time. If I could go back, that moment wouldn’t even exist anymore. She’s gone. Forever. And I can’t seem to move on. Nothing excites me. If I had known that one Friday night would be the last time I’d see her, I would’ve held her tighter, kissed her on the forehead, and told her I loved her.

I’ve spent years automating my home (lights, blinds, sensors), but I realized the biggest daily friction point was still manual: **Meal Planning and Grocery Lists**.

Existing apps were too clunky or required too much manual input. I wanted a ""set it and forget it"" system where I define the parameters (logic), and the system outputs the schedule.

So, I built QookCommander. 

It uses AI to generate a weekly meal plan and automatically aggregates the ingredients into a sorted grocery list, optimized to minimize food waste.

**I’m looking for beta testers to stress-test the logic.**

If you want to try it out, I’ll manually generate a plan and grocery list for you to import into your workflow (or stick on your fridge tablet).

**Comment with your ""Config Parameters"":**

* **Cuisine Type:** (e.g., South Indian / Mediterranean / Mix)
* **Household Size:**
* **Diet Logic:** (e.g., ""Meat only on weekends"", ""Vegan"", ""No Dairy"")
* **Exclude List:** (Ingredients you want to blacklist)

I’ll run these through the system and reply with a link to your structured plan within 24 hours.

**Future Goal:** eventually wanting to integrate this via API to display on a dashboard (Home Assistant/Dakboard), so feedback on the data structure is welcome!

I usually spend this time at a mall near my home, walking around, having a coffee at half price and maybe a snack. However, I've noticed that lately, I spend nearly every day, or every day I have free, doing this. 

And now I feel... Guilty? My peers are so invested in college activities and internships, while I just bike, hike and mall walk, and I don't have a lot of friends. I do volunteer as a teacher and have a gym membership, but I can't help but feel I'm doing something wrong, because who walks around a mall for three consecutive working days? 

On the other hand, I don't have much else I can do. I don't sleep in late and I often feel stuffy at home, so I have to do something. Occasionally I'll read an old literature book or something related to my studies, but I just feel like I'm a weirdo, and behind everyone else (academically, I'd say I'm average, but I posses the capacity to do more, if I had the will to).

Every time I ran my script, the model would hallucinate keys that didn't exist or ""helpfully"" truncate the data because it thought the list was too long. I tried everything to fix it—I tweaked the temperature up and down and even wrote a 500-word prompt explaining exactly why it shouldn't be ""helpful"".

By the four-hour mark, I was literally shouting at my IDE. My prompt was so bloated with ""DO NOT DO THIS"" and ""NEVER DO THAT"" that I think I actually confused the model into submission. It was outputting pure garbage, and I had one of those ""maybe I'm just not cut out for this"" moments. I finally walked away, grabbed a coffee, and realized I was treating the LLM like a disobedient child instead of a logic engine.

I went back, deleted the entire ""Rules"" section, and tried a different approach: I told the model to imagine it was a ""strict compiler"". I instructed it that if the input didn't map perfectly to the schema, it should return a null value and explain why in a separate log object—no apologies and no extra talk. I also added a ""Step 0"" where it had to generate a schema of the CSV before processing it.

It worked perfectly; 100/100 rows parsed with zero hallucinations. It’s a humbling reminder that in prompt engineering, ""more instructions"" usually just equals ""more noise"".

# CHAPTER ONE: THE TARGET

The assassin was in the target’s bedroom, and everything was perfect. The target was alone, unaware, bent over a desk, half asleep, counting something that didn’t matter. Moonlight spilled through half-closed blinds, painting stripes across the carpet. Dust floated lazily in the light, unnoticed by the target.

The assassin didn’t even consider a gun. Even a suppressed pistol would never be silent. He had learned that lesson the hard way once—almost got himself killed. The memory of that night clung to him: metallic scent of blood, echoing gunshot, the bitter taste of fear. He carried it like a scar.

The air smelled faintly of cedar and old laundry. He could hear the faint hum of the building’s HVAC, the distant horn of a car on the street below, the soft scrape of his boots on the carpet. Careful. Quiet. Every muscle coiled, every movement deliberate.

The knife in his hand was cold, heavy, balanced perfectly. He focused on nothing but the motion and the outcome.

He struck.

The blade sank into the target’s chest, straight through the back of the heart. The target collapsed. Blood spread across the floor, dark and slow, pooling beneath the light. For a heartbeat, he watched the lifeless corpse. No breathing. He searched for a pulse. Felt nothing. He searched the target. A wallet. He opened it and found their ID.

*Jonathan Monroe*

*Born November 7th, 1986*

*Eyes: Blue*

*Hair: Auburn*

*Height: 6’2*

*Weight: 185 lbs*

*Issued: November 30, 2024*

*Expiration: November 30, 2031*

Later, in some nameless hotel room, the assassin would drink coffee, turn on the TV, scroll through his phone, and try to remember what it felt like to live a normal life. He used to have friends. They called him Alex. Saturday nights were theirs—elbows on the bar, laughter spilling across scratched tables, a pint in hand, someone trying to beat him at pool. Then home, where the TV flickered and popcorn burned, the comfort of ordinary life pressing around him like a warm coat.

Life had been simple. Until it wasn’t. A mugging. A gun. Medical bills he couldn’t pay. Debt that buried him alive. Alexander Torres was ruined.

He became an assassin. A ghost. He never missed. He never left a trace.

But he remembered everyone he killed. Every one. Even the most ordinary. Criminals. Terrorists. Serial killers. Money launderers. Faces. Families. Friends. Voices he would never forget. Even the most mundane of them had left marks he could never erase.

Sometimes, he could still hear them. Whispering. Screaming. Laughing. He closed his eyes. He shut it out. Tried to breathe. Tried to sleep. Tried to forget. But sleep was fleeting, and the memories were relentless.

Every assignment had its rhythm. Observation. Planning. Execution. He knew the target’s route, the sound of their keys, the timing of their evening coffee. Every motion anticipated, every second scheduled. Time was never a problem. Precision always came first. Always.

When the job was done, he moved on to the next. It always worked this way. Always like clockwork. Every step measured. Every second accounted for. And yet… the faces lingered. The small mistakes. The forgotten movements. The questions of whether he had done the right thing. The people he had killed seemed innocent every time, no matter how bad they were. Some actually begged for their lives. Alex felt like a terrible person would not.

The hotel room was quiet. The city outside hummed with life, unaware of him, unaware of what he had become. The walls, the ceiling, the narrow bed—it all felt sterile and small, a cage he had chosen willingly.

The phone buzzed across the nightstand. Same number as always.

Alex stared at it.

The light from the screen reflected on the hotel room’s walls. Shadows stretched across the carpet, reaching like long fingers toward the bed. The blood, the faces, the echoes—they waited for him. Always waiting.

He took a slow breath.

His fingers hovered just above the phone.

And he answered.

I already have a SCCO that I love (Navy +Green check) and a CCO (Black) but would love a fun color and Deep Sea would compliment my SCCO.

I'm thinking we might have to get both the Medium Bowler in Blurred Gingham Brown since I love my leopard standard but want a bowler that fits my laptop AND an ECB because I have been LOOKING for an everyday bag with the functionality of a backpack. 😬😅

I also LOVE COFFEE and can't decide between the two.

Think tours are currently sold out, but I hear they may be able to fit you in last minute dt cancellations or you can plan your own hike and we can reconvene after. Would love extra company. Splitting car costs probably around $40 if one extra person. Let me know if you’re interested in joining and want to meetup bf hand in a coffee shop for a vibe check (or you can't make it but want to meet up for future similar adventure). Think post follow rules on events and meetups, but sorry mods if I missed something.",4,1769840555.0,SFbitcheswithtaste,2,0.75,False

In truth, the last time I tried I was maybe hip height, and my primary job was licking the whisk clean. I don’t think my dad was much of a baker either, but he did one recipe really well. And I don’t know what it was. 

I’ll spare the details, because I don’t remember them too well and they aren’t of concern here. But in short, he forfeited me to my ma when I was ten. I haven’t had a single word of contact with that entire side of my family since. I have a few feelings about that. But I swear, the muffins he used to make were the best I’ve ever had in my life. Nostalgia is most definitely playing a part, but here’s what I know:

They weren’t fancy, no pumpkin or coffee or berries or anything. It was just a damn good batter, and a generous sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar on top. 

I don’t expect a 1:1 match here. That’d be insane to expect given what I’m offering here. But I guess my hope is someone can point me to a recipe or two y’all’d vouch for, that this describes, and that a baking noob like myself could try. 

Any recipe suggestions are appreciated. Thank you.",1,1769840450.0,BakingNoobs,2,1.0,False

I don’t know if you’ll ever read this... maybe it’s better that you don’t. But there are things sitting heavy on my chest, and I need to let them out somewhere. So here I am.

You’ve always held a strange place in my heart. Even now, after all this time, even after I tried to move on even if there wasnt anything between us... there’s a part of me that still wonders about us. About what we could have been. Maybe that’s what makes this so hard.

Seeing you again, even just for coffee… stirred everything back up. I can’t lie... it felt good. Familiar. Like part of me woke up. But now that I’ve had time to sit with it, I realize something deeper: I don’t think you came back for me. Not fully. I think you just didn’t want to lose me completely... just in case.

And that’s what hurts.

Because I’m not your “just in case.”

I’m not a backup.

I’m not the person you come back to only when you’re unsure of what you already have.

I cared deeply for you. I probably always will in some small way. But I can’t keep living in a story where I’m waiting on your maybe. I deserve a chapter where I’m someone’s first choice. Not a spare tire waiting in the trunk for when things go flat.

This isn’t about blame... it’s just truth. And maybe you didn’t mean to hurt me. But I’ve hurt myself enough by holding on to a version of you that lives more in my memory than in my reality.

So this is me letting go. Not because I hate you. But because I love myself enough to stop waiting.

Thank you for being part of my story.

But now, it’s time I write the next part... without you at the center.",1,1769840446.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False
