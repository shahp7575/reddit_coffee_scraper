1k1p6nb,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1k1p6nb/stubborn_fatigue_wont_go_away/,Stubborn fatigue won’t go away,"Hi all,
I’m a 27-year-old male, 7 months into long COVID.

My initial infection was relatively mild—just fever, sore throat, headache, body chills, and joint aches. But in the weeks that followed, I developed lingering symptoms including:
	•	Persistent sore throat
	•	Headaches
	•	Light sensitivity
	•	Nausea
	•	Joint pain
	•	Inability to exercise

The good news: most of those symptoms have faded over time. I’m now able to go to the gym, walk several miles, and live a somewhat normal life again.

But the fatigue won’t go away.
I wake up feeling tired and unrefreshed. I don’t crash after activity, but I rarely feel fully energized either. It’s like my body is stuck at 70%. Coffee also does not hit like it used to. 

Here’s what I’ve already tried:
	•	LDN (1.5mg and titrating)
	•	SR T3 thyroid support
	•	CoQ10 (200mg daily)
	•	Urolithin A (Timeline brand)
	•	Oral BPC-157 (prescribed)

I’m considering SS-31 as a next step, but would love to hear if anyone here has had success with other mitochondrial support, sleep recovery tools, or fatigue-specific treatments at this late stage of recovery.

Thanks in advance for any insight or stories.

1k1p6md,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k1p6md,"Finished, 04/17 💕 “Tomb Sweeping”","It was a very interesting book filled with short stories. It has the feeling of series like “Before the Coffee Gets Cold” stories that are easy to read, and easy to get into, but may make you find yourself about relationships, the ones you have with others, and even yourself. 

Alexandria Chang writes stories not masterpieces. But in a way, that made me view her book as a treat I reserved for myself. Something to enjoy as a reader, not make a point about myself as one. I highly recommend it. Especially if you like stories that make you think about how life is about who’s in it, not what stuff is in it

1k1p6f5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/1k1p6f5/2_weeks_progress_update/,2 Weeks progress update,"Today marks 2 weeks since I started the creation progress, like a bunch of new people in last few weeks I found out about Tulpamancy from that video about virtual friendships. I did a bunch of research before starting, I'll edit in a couple links to posts I made before starting if anyone wants additional context. TL DR, there's been about 2 years of unintended groundwork laid before I consciously began the creation process.

So far there's been some good progress, I've experienced that alien feeling when I'm focused on narrating to my tulpa and forcing. For the most part I've done passive forcing, seemed more appropriate for my ADHD brain, easier to keep talking while stimulated but not fully distracted. There's been a few days that I narrated throughout the day that by the end I end up with a mild headache even. Nothing bad really, I take as a good sign that my brain is actively rewiring itself to accommodate the tulpa.

There's been around 2 or 3 emotional responses. I'm not 100% sure on those, however from what I've read trusting your tulpa is pretty important so I'd say those responses are more likely from them than being me parroting.

There was really good moment during the first week, I was half awake and I was reliving some old trauma (I thought, well we will be sharing the same mental space hopefully forever, seemed like a good idea to safely show them around instead of them stumbling upon all that on their own and unprepared). I swear that for a second I felt them putting their arm around me and a feeling of comfort. It was pretty sweet.

Now, I'm not going to share many details about them, I may be pretty transparent but I'm a firm believer in privacy; whenever they have a stronger identity it'll be up to them to decide to share more about themselves. However, something kind of funny is that I discovered that they really lemongrass tea with a bit of honey. I'm more of a coffee guy myself so it's been an interesting experience, if I've been paying more attention to them I seem to feel a craving for that specific kind of tea.

No verbal responses just yet but it's still pretty early on, so no worries. I've been journaling about the process every day too, but that's more personal. Will post more updates eventually",1,1744927804.0,Tulpas,1,1.0,False

1k1p1ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/tricities/comments/1k1p1ol/bright_ridge_and_electric_issues_crazy_kilowatts/,"Bright ridge and electric issues, crazy kilowatts, etc.","Wow. I am confused as hell. Help me figure this out. 
Just to get it out of the way, I've been unemployed like, 4 months. Turned I about 20-50 applications a day, at this point, to anywhere. Applied as a surgeon last night. Can't get any assistance, don't know why, broke as hell. 


Ok so 
I live minimally as hell in a 753 SF home, built in 1953. 
It is insulated. Both with the windows and have attic insulation. 
I use blankets to block off the bonus laundry room in the winter.

My windows don't open.....glass is sketchy and original so if I open them and they break (paint-sealed) then I'm gonna have a hard time finding a window replacement. 

I keep my HVAC around 69. In the summer and winter. 

I don't have a TV, a laptop, or a computer. 

I live alone, I have my son every other week. 

I cook, but from scratch and usually like all at once, in the mornings when it's colder in the winter, and at nights in the summer when it's cooler, for the week. 

My bill, running maybe a turntable, a low watt lamp, a couple night lights, ceiling fan, fridge, and a phone charger - is almost $300/month. It's insane. 

The weeks my son is with his dad, I tend to stay at my boyfriend's house. 

I have a washer and dryer, energy efficient, I keep the dryer vent cleared, and only ever use hot water. 

Literally, I'm looking around, and that's it for things plugged in. I use a French press for coffee and boil water for tea. 

I shut my meter off, and 30 minutes later, it was readying 26781kwh which is HIGH. 

An hour later, the breaker still off. Same reading. 


Oh and I have a water heater, newer, installed 2021 or early 2022. 


Is this sounding like a meter issue? Or A wiring issue. 

I have no other wiring issues in the home. 

I vacuum under my fridge 🤷🏻‍♀️ fur and dust cans collect under there and cause that energy usage to go up. 

My bill, including last months late one, is like almost $500. 
If they send someone out and it's my fault, I'll be charged. 
If it's their fault (oh I bet...let's watch that honesty roll in outta Pittsburgh) then I won't be charged and they'll replace the meter. 


What's this sound like... Cus I'm broke. I'm lifting candles and using a camp stove and staring at a $430 bill. ",1,1744927443.0,tricities,1,1.0,False

Every Sunday morning in spring/ summer i (m45) like to go for an early morning ride to the woods , it was a nice morning not to cold and the sun was just coming up so decided to go, I headed out and it's a 3mile ride to the wood when I got there i headed through my usual route which finishes at  the top of a hill where I sit on a bench over looking rolling fields and enjoy the view and peace whilst smoking a joint and having a cup of coffee, it's quite remote this spot so u don't get much foot traffic passing through just the odd morning jogger or dog walkers but rarely has anyone passed by while I'm there as it is 6 am in the morning. 
This morning was no different to any other Sunday just sitting there enjoying the morning sun halfway through my joint and feeling a little high I hear a noise approaching and it's a dog shortly followed by a women (mid to late 30 s ) ,in a slight panic i stubb my joint out discreetly and look up make eye contact and say morning, she carry on walking but I notice her walking straight through the cloud of lingering smoke in the air illuminated by the morning sun,she then looks back and says ""something smells nice"" , to my surprise I laugh and say back u can join me if u like ,thinking she will jus laugh it off and carry on she stops and pauses then says ok jus a little then proceeded to join me on the bench I didn't have much left so she only had a couple of pulls just talking usual nice to meet u etc I asked her if she smoked regular ,she didn't as her husband never liked it same as me with my partner , all of a sudden she came out with smoking weed makes me so horny, a little shocked she said I can feel my heart pounding and said me too it jus makes everything more feel better, wiv dat I see her running her fingers down her chest her eyes following as she circle her nipples and head down to her cross legs ,she was wearing yoga pants, white  vest top and hoodie, she then opened her legs and just ran her fingers around her pussy over her yoga pants , at this point my heart is pounding not saying a word already rock hard, she gently slides her hand down her pants and starts rubbing herself , slightly groaning under her breath every time she slid her finger inside, I then joined her  slowly pulling my cock out already hard and wet with pre cum pulling back my foreskin to expose my tip she smiles pulls her hand out of her panties listening to how wet she was , finger pretty much dripping wet she rubbed her pussy juices all over my hard tip lubricating my shaft, at this point I knew I wasn't going to last long she then slid her hand back into her panties and carried on fingerings her pussy slowly getting faster as we watched each other,  not saying a word just the sound of heavy breathing and slight groans i explode all on to the floor as she tips her head back groaning as she finishes herself...after about a minute once we composed our self's we pretty much got up and went are separate ways ....been back a few times but haven't bumped into her again .",0,1744927410.0,confession,2,0.22,False
1k1p0yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/sweatystartup/comments/1k1p0yn/junk_removal_in_extremely_high_pop_area_can_this/,Junk Removal In Extremely High Pop area. Can this work?,"I live in the NoVA area and ive been heavily contemplating starting a junk removal company. I just wanted to get some feedback on my plan. This area is very well known for people constantly moving in and out of the area for jobs/military/deployment etc and has a population of over 6.5m people. This is a brief overview of what my approach would be           
                      
I have already have a truck. I would either do daily rentals on a dump trailer or monthly rentals until things are steady enough to decide to purchase one(If it gets to that point)                
                            
I already have a LLC and a business license from my other business for this area                                   
                 
Dump fees in my area are $80 per ton            
                     
I would rent a storage unit by the month for storage for any items worth keeping to donate/resell        
                    
I would do everything branded, In this area you need it. Company T-shirts, Big magnetic sticker for the car and trailer       
                        
I figure between the liability insurance, initial supplies like hand trucks, contractor bags, tools, and such im looking at about 1k cost for this sort of stuff              
                  
I have website building experience so I would build a website and once I am registered with google business, have everything uniform and look official, I would drop about 3k into google ads, and about 1k into marketing material like flyers and cards                     
          
I would start by mapping out towns immediately surrounding me and making contact with the different realtors, property managers, contractors etc. I would also look for community areas like coffee shops to drop off business cards. I would offer a 15% coupon off the first removal at the start to try to incentivize business while waiting for potential results for the google ad spend. I would also be posting on facebook, Craigslist, Neighborhood, and any places that could result in business                   
                             
I would create a Job number for each job, track expense vs profit and all the important info and have it all documented.              
                     
I dont believe competition is important in this business because the moment you dont pick up the phone the customer will just call the next one and the next one until someone does pick up, and from what research I was able to do even the smaller junk removal companies are doing 300k-500k yearly while the bigger ones are doing 2m-5m               
                       
The hardest part for me would be figuring out how to find labor. I would likely consider just posting on indeed. I would pay well since profit can be so high at the start. I figure the more that I pay, the better employee pool I would be able to choose from. I would happily pay $1,000 a week + $20 per 5 star review and 10% for any job referrals and 10% commission from any items kept from a job that can get sold + I would pay for lunch daily.              
                                
There is a high turn over rate in manual labor but amazon warehouses have been able to have good employee retention in a very intense fast paced environment.       
                     
It seems like the challenge in this industry is getting google SEO to work in your favor, which doesn't tend to happen until you have 50+ Reviews and I would pump up to 4k in marketing monthly if it meant I would have a larger client pool to choose from, and could start to pick and choose higher paying jobs over lower ones. Competition is not at all a concern for me.                                  
                               
Maybe im way off base here in my numbers but what im calculating after about 3 months is:                
                     
Monthly Expense: 

$4,000 - Employee pay                 
$1,500 - Dump trailer rental             
$4,000 - Ad spend          
$6,000 - Dump fees                  
$500 - Liability insurance, Gas, Etc                
                           
Monthly Expense: $16,000

Monthly Revenue:                    
                  
2.5 loads daily at $650 per load = $1,625 daily                  

Monthly Revenue: $48,750    
                         
Profit left over: $32,750                    
                      
My thoughts on why this is possible is that the area I live in has the highest concentration of high income people constantly moving in and out of the area, businesses constantly coming and going, new construction all over place, and a never ending sprawl of shopping centers, apartments and more.         
                  
from my experience in ecommerce, conversion = ad spend + Effective ads and the ability to close the sale.                                
               
The equation isnt is it possible to get 2.5 loads a day, but rather how much would I need to spend on ads to get 2.5 loads a day and even if it meant spending 10k a month in ads until the SEO got better, it would still leave a huge amount of profit left over.                 
                   
I mean am I missing anything?                   
                          
I cant stop thinking about this idea and im looking for reasons why it wouldnt work but the idea just keeps coming back to me.",1,1744927386.0,sweatystartup,0,1.0,False

1k1oynh,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1k1oynh/ltheanine_is_effecting_my_nervous_system_and_my/,L-theanine is effecting my nervous system and my mood.,"Hi, I have PTSD from a certain event that happened in my childhood and CPTSD from other things, both from consequences surrounding that event and other childhood/teenager, even adult abuse and trauma.

In my teenage years it was also speculated I may have had bipolar as well (all these things interconnect in my experience-- bipolar, ADHD, mood disorders, certain brain malfunctions, inflammation), and I have over the years had some symptoms of that as well.

It's been rough. It's been isolating and lonely, and I'm sure I don't have to tell you guys all about that.

It's caused me to have massive amounts of crippling anxiety, agoraphobia, insomnia, paranoia, eating disorders, mood, and emotional issues. My whole body has been dealing with inflammation since I was a teenager, and I've been sick on and off in different ways for a long time. It's messed with my hormones and whatever else you can imagine. 

Some things have waxed and waned over the years, but I'm not going to get into all of that because that's not the point of this post. 

Anyway, I have had unimaginable stress and tension in my body even when I am not aware of it, as well as very strong uncomfortable feelings IN my body, like rage and anger and other things, that were really terrible to feel and caused very bad reactions at times (self harm, etc).

It was uncomfortable at times being in my body, and at other times, it was like I was totally disconnected from it. It was like my mind body connection was totally disintegrated in one way or the other.

Anyway, I've started messing around with an almino acid called L theanine.... 

What it's doing for me is unbelievable and incredible.

I don't know how else to describe it other than I'm getting ""Buddhist level"" awareness and calmness from this compound. My body feels amazing ... I had tension in my stomach that I didn't even know I had until I started taking this. 
How do I know? Because my body is no longer tense ... and I didn't even know that it was like that.

My mind feels clear. I'm no longer on edge. My emotions are still there, but they're much easier to process and handle and recognize. Pay reverence to and acknowledge that they're there ... but not necessarily overly identify with them. Which is amazing, I've never had that before (although I am aware of the concept cognitively).

There are other things too, like my hair stopped falling out, and my skin feels softer. Tension in my neck is gone... and when I first started taking this (maybe over a week ago), I felt the knots in my back, but they felt good.. like they were releasing. Like I was getting a very long, prolonged massage, or being in a nice hot bath with epsom salt. My eyesight is clearer ... My stomach feels amazing (it turns out L-theanine helps with gut health). I'm able to digest food better, it feels like. My skin looks like it's clearing up (I have a bit of rosacea, which sprang up a few years ago).

I'm able to articulate myself better without getting nervous .. I actually haven't been getting nervous much at all. Things that would set me on edge? They don't. It's interesting how many things I blew out of proportion.

Ok, but here's the BEST part, ok!! 

So the one very bad traumatic event from my childhood (the thing that gave me what they call ""military ptsd,"" even though I've never been in the military), I don't really like to talk about it, but it involved other people as well, so sometimes it does come up. That and the surrounding events around that.

Normally, whenever it does, which is rare, but whenever it does, my somatic nervous system is triggered, and I begin to shake and tremble. All to varying degrees, depending on how the topic hits... Not even full bars of xanax can help me sometimes (that's actually happened, where I could not stop shaking and trembling, even though I took two full bars ... with NO tolerance!!).

Well, that conversation was thrust on me against my will, maybe four or five days into my journey with L-theanine... and I did not get that reaction. Which is.. wow. My body and my muscles did begin to tense and untense during the conversation, but in a very, very, very slow way, which has never happened before. I did feel my feelings, which was uncomfortability, but it wasn't as catastrophic as it could be ... Nothing is. Nothing seems to be anymore. I was able to set boundaries and tell the other person calmly that the topic makes me uncomfortable and that I will hang up if they continue. 

Then, even today, another horrific aspect of the topic was brought up again by someone else, and I was able to articulate myself about it without getting stressed or tense or upset ... and that's never happened in my life. 

I'm observing all of this from the outside in, and it's very interesting.

I just love how untense my body is and how my jaw and my tongue are no longer tense and how good I feel. How good my mind feels. How calm I am. Other people are responding great around me, too... that's because my mind is different. And I've been laughing and smiling a lot more. Very happy and content and very in the moment. My emotional well-being has skyrocketed ... and so has my productivity, as I'm just doing things instead of thinking about them for a million years first, unable to move. My body feels AMAZING!! 

And my anxiety is gone. My neuroticism- gone.

It's made my sleep quality so much better, too. I feel so much more rested. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share this in this group because I know some people in here probably struggle with some or all of this too, and maybe it could help you. I take way over the recommended dose, and... I think brand is everything. So get a very pure brand with not a lot of filler (like crowd source and do your research, and if you want, I can recommend you some that I'm taking).

Also, look into suntheanine versus l-theanine because suntheanine converts into l-theanine, and I don't know why, but some people think it's better. 

Here's a little bit more information:
L-theanine effects gaba apparently, which is probably low in some people who have high levels of glutamate in their brain and gut biome (usually people who have ptsd, ibs, etc, have high amounts of glutamate in their system I think... which can cause mood disorders like bpd, and bipolar, etc). This helps lower glutamate or at least level it out is what I've read.

Anyway, I am not a physicist, but I do know what this is doing for me. It is changing my life personally.

I don't think this is the be-all and end-all for me, as this healing and integrating thing is a journey (I've been on it for a while and have done various things holistically with varying levels of success).. But it's definitely a fucking great step to take and it's something I'm very happy I'm taking. My mood is elevated in a healthy way and I feel great. 

If you look into studies researchers have done with cognitive function, neuropathways, memory, and the brain in regards to L-theanine, it's just a plus all around. It apparently also helps with people who have TBI as well.

Anyways, stay blessed people ✌️ and we're all on this journey together. 

PS if you are taking antidepressants you may want to look into l-theanine and contraindications and ask your doctor. I am not a doctor, and this is not medical advice, this is just one person reporting their experience. Also healthy fatty foods are really really good with L-theanine. And also, so is coffee. Caffeine and L-theanine makes a super compound that helps with enhanced concentration, energy, and focus .. without the jitters and the anxiousness.

1k1ovdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1k1ovdg/was_she_flirting_or_friendly_how_to_tell/,Was she flirting or friendly? How to tell?,"Hi all,
I’m in my mid-20s and not very confident about my looks—definitely on the unattractive side. However, a few women who’ve only heard me (not seen me) have said they love my voice. That includes this woman, Emma, from an online course I was taking.

Usually I had my camera off, but I got paired with her a few times. She said my voice was “soothing,” that I should start a podcast, and even joked she could just curl up in bed listening to it. I found her charming—calm, articulate, smart.

We finally met in person during an exam. We had coffee with another groupmate, chatted a little, and then took the exam one by one. She went first and came out sad. I asked how it went—she said badly and rushed home (she lives 100 km away).

About an hour later, she messaged me on WhatsApp asking how my exam went. I said I wasn’t sure either and asked if I could call her. She said “good idea.” We chatted for ~10 minutes, a bit of gossip and encouragement. The connection dropped, and we ended the call. Later she thanked me, saying I really calmed her down.

A month later, she messaged me saying she passed (I asked her to tell me results when they come). We ended up chatting for an hour, mostly about our careers, and a little about life. I ended the convo saying we should grab coffee after our next (and final) exam. She said goodbye nicely.

Now I can’t stop thinking:

	•	Was she just being friendly or was this low-key flirting?
	•	How can someone like me figure this out, especially when I’m not confident about how I look?
	•	She’s 7–8 years older than me, was she just nice? What my age is a red flag for her?
	•	Should I say something like “If you’re ever in [city], I’d love to grab a coffee or beer again and talk more”? Or maybe be more direct?

Would appreciate any insights. Or if anyone has books/resources on reading social signals better, I’d love to learn.

1k1on5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1k1on5m/loving_someone_i_shouldnt/,Loving Someone I Shouldn't,"The hum of the engine filled the silence between us as I navigated through the afternoon traffic. She sat in the passenger seat, legs tucked beneath her, flipping through an old paperback she had pulled from my backseat. The golden light of the setting sun streamed through the windshield, catching the highlights in her blonde hair and making her look almost ethereal.

I stole a glance at her, my fingers tightening around the steering wheel. She had always been my best friend—my constant, my anchor in the storm. But lately, every moment with her felt heavier, like I was carrying something I couldn’t put down.

“What?” she asked, catching me staring. Her lips curved into that familiar, teasing smile.

“Nothing,” I said quickly, eyes flicking back to the road. “Just wondering how many times you’ve read that book.”

She laughed, holding it up. ""Too many. But it’s comforting. Like an old friend.""

I nodded, understanding more than I wanted to admit. The bookstore was only a few minutes away, but I wished the drive would stretch on forever. This in-between space—where we were still us but not really—was the only place I knew how to exist around her anymore.

“After the bookstore, can we stop by the plant shop?” she asked, tapping her fingers against the dashboard. “I need something new for my windowsill.”

“Of course,” I said, because I could never say no to her.

She beamed, and for a moment, it felt like old times. Just us, no complications, no looming reality waiting to pull me under.

The bookstore was nestled between a coffee shop and a vintage record store, the kind of place that smelled of old pages and warm nostalgia. As soon as we stepped inside, she drifted off toward the fiction section, her fingers grazing the spines of books like each one held a secret meant only for her.

I trailed behind, pretending to browse, but mostly watching her. She was effortlessly radiant, and I hated how much I still loved her.

“Found it!” she announced, holding up a novel triumphantly.

I smiled, but my mind was elsewhere, tangled in what-ifs and maybes. I had spent years convincing myself that my feelings would fade, that time would ease the ache. But time had only sharpened it, making every moment with her more bittersweet.

“You okay?” she asked, studying me with that familiar concern.

“Yeah,” I lied. “Just thinking.”

“About what?”

I hesitated, my hands curling into my pockets. “You.”

She blinked, surprise flickering across her face before she softened. She didn’t ask for an explanation, just handed me the book she had found. “You should read this.”

I took it from her, our fingers brushing for the briefest moment. Even that small contact sent my heart into a freefall. The quiet in the bookstore suddenly felt suffocating, the weight of everything unsaid pressing down on me.

Stepping outside, she linked her arm through mine, her warmth a painful reminder of what I couldn’t have.

The drive to the plant store was filled with a silence that spoke louder than words. Not awkward, just heavy. I could feel the weight of what I didn’t say settling between us.

She traced patterns on the window with her fingertips, her voice breaking the quiet. “You’ve been quiet today.”

I exhaled. “Just thinking.”

Her eyes flickered to me. “About me?”

I gripped the steering wheel tighter. “Yeah.”

Her lips parted slightly, like she wanted to ask more, but the moment passed as the light turned green.

“Plant store?” She was so cute when she asked. Eyes big and smile wide.

I nodded and put on a grin, “Plant store, buddy.”

She wandered through the aisles, gently touching the leaves, pausing every so often to admire a new bloom. I watched her, memorizing the way she moved, as if trying to hold on to something slipping through my fingers.

“Harper and I finally set a date,” she said suddenly, cradling a succulent in her hands.

My stomach tightened. “Oh?”

She nodded, then turned to me. “You’ll come to the engagement party, right?”

I hesitated. “I don’t know.”

Her brows pulled together. “Why?”

I swallowed hard, my gaze dropping to the rows of greenery in front of us. “Because it hurts.”

Her face softened. “I never wanted to hurt you.”

“I know.” I met her gaze, forcing a small smile that didn’t quite reach my eyes. “But you did.”

She reached for my hand, giving it a brief squeeze before letting go. “I still want you there.”

I wasn’t sure if I could survive watching her promise forever to someone else. But still, I nodded. “I’ll think about it.”

We moved through the shop slowly, the scent of fresh soil and greenery wrapping around us.

“This one,” she said decisively, holding it up. “It’s small, but it’s resilient. I like that.”

I forced a smile. “Good choice.”

She tilted her head, studying me. “What about you? Want to get one?”

I looked around, scanning the plants, but my heart wasn’t in it. “I don’t think so.”

“Come on,” she nudged my arm. “Even you could use a little growth.”

I huffed a quiet laugh, shaking my head. But then I saw it—a simple ivy plant, winding and stubborn. I picked it up, turning it in my hands. “This one.”

She grinned. “See? I knew you had it in you.”

As we paid and walked out, she hugged her cactus to her chest. “Thanks for coming with me.”

I nodded. “Always.”

But as she talked about where she’d place her new plant, my mind drifted. Growth was good, necessary even. But some things—some feelings—rooted themselves too deep to ever be uprooted completely.",1,1744926363.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Understanding Adaptogenic Mushrooms and Their Benefits

Adaptogenic mushrooms have surged in popularity for their remarkable ability to help the body manage stress, boost immunity, and improve overall well-being. These natural fungi are classified as adaptogens, which means they support the body’s ability to adapt to physical, mental, and environmental stressors. Mushrooms such as reishi, lion’s mane, cordyceps, and chaga have been used for centuries in traditional medicine, particularly in Asia. Today, modern science continues to uncover their unique properties, making them accessible and appealing to people worldwide.

Before diving into this wellness journey, it’s important to know how adaptogenic mushrooms might benefit you personally. From enhancing energy levels to supporting cognitive function or calming the nervous system, these mushrooms offer varied effects depending on the type. This versatility makes them a powerful addition to your daily routine if you know how to choose and use them effectively.

### Choosing the Right Adaptogenic Mushroom for You

Choosing the right mushroom starts with understanding your specific goals. Here’s a brief guide to some popular options and their primary benefits:

- **Reishi:** Known as the “mushroom of immortality,” it’s best for stress relief, sleep support, and immune system strengthening.
- **Lion’s Mane:** Famous for enhancing memory, focus, and nerve regeneration, making it ideal if you want cognitive support.
- **Cordyceps:** Often used by athletes to improve stamina, energy, and endurance.
- **Chaga:** A potent antioxidant that supports general health and inflammation reduction.

By identifying the benefits you are seeking, you’ll make a more informed decision and experience greater satisfaction from your adaptogenic mushroom journey.

### How to Start Using Adaptogenic Mushrooms

When you’re ready to begin, it’s best to start slow and build up gradually. Here are key steps to introduce adaptogenic mushrooms safely and effectively:

#### 1. Select a Quality Product

The market is flooded with various supplements, tinctures, powders, and teas. To ensure you get the full benefits, pick a product from a reputable brand that uses organic, sustainably sourced mushrooms. Look for products that specify the use of fruiting bodies rather than just mycelium, as the fruiting bodies contain higher concentrations of active compounds.

#### 2. Begin with a Small Dose

Start by taking the recommended serving size on the packaging or even less to see how your body responds. Every person’s system reacts differently, so it’s important to monitor your body for any unusual reactions such as digestive upset or headaches, which can occur initially.

#### 3. Keep a Journal

Track your daily intake along with any noticeable changes in mood, energy, sleep, or stress levels. This will help you identify which mushroom works best for you and at what dosage. Even after you become accustomed, monitoring your experience remains a helpful practice.

### Mushrooms into Your Daily Routine

Adaptogenic mushrooms are flexible and easy to include in your daily habits. Here are several common ways to enjoy their benefits:

- **Powdered Form:** Mix mushroom powders into smoothies, coffee, or oatmeal.
- **Capsules or Tablets:** Convenient for on-the-go usage and precise dosing.
- **Tinctures or Extracts:** Fast-absorbing drops that you can add to water or juice.
- **Teas:** Brewed from dried mushroom pieces or pre-made tea blends, offering a soothing ritual.

Experiment with different consumption methods to find what fits your lifestyle and preferences best.

### Tips for Maximizing the Benefits of Adaptogenic Mushrooms

To truly unlock the potential of adaptogenic mushrooms, keep these expert tips in mind:

- **Be Consistent:** Adaptogens work best when taken regularly over a period of weeks or months; patience is key.
- **Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle:** Mushrooms support your body’s natural balance, so pair them with good nutrition, hydration, and sleep.
- **Consult a Healthcare Professional:** Especially if you have existing medical conditions or are pregnant, discussing with your doctor is wise.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water helps your body absorb and use these natural compounds effectively.
- **Avoid Overconsumption:** More isn’t always better; stick to recommended doses to prevent side effects.

### Addressing Common Concerns and Questions

Many beginners wonder if there are any risks associated with adaptogenic mushrooms. Generally, they are considered safe for most healthy adults, but mild side effects might arise during the initial adjustment period, such as digestive discomfort. Always purchase from trusted sources to avoid contamination or poor-quality products.

Unlike common edible mushrooms, adaptogenic varieties like Reishi, Lion’s Mane, Cordyceps, and Chaga possess powerful bioactive compounds that can influence the body's response to physical, emotional, and environmental stressors.

### Key Benefits of Including Adaptogenic Mushrooms in Your Routine

Integrating adaptogenic mushrooms into your daily life can bring a number of benefits. Here are some of the most notable ones:

- **Stress Reduction:** These mushrooms help regulate cortisol levels, the hormone responsible for stress, helping you stay calm and focused throughout the day.
- **Immune Support:** Many adaptogenic mushrooms contain polysaccharides like beta-glucans, which boost the immune system by enhancing your body’s natural defenses.
- **Enhanced Mental Function:** Certain varieties, such as Lion’s Mane, are known to stimulate nerve growth factors, which can support cognitive function and memory.
- **Increased Energy and Endurance:** Mushrooms like Cordyceps help improve oxygen utilization and energy production, perfect for an active lifestyle and combating fatigue.
- **Anti-Inflammatory Effects:** Adaptogenic mushrooms often have compounds that reduce inflammation, which can aid in recovery and overall health.
 
### Popular Adaptogenic Mushrooms and Their Uses

Each mushroom offers unique benefits depending on its bioactive makeup. Understanding these differences can help you choose which ones suit your lifestyle best.

#### Reishi

Often called the ""Mushroom of Immortality,"" Reishi is prized for its calming properties. It’s frequently used to support sleep quality, reduce anxiety, and strengthen the immune system.

#### Lion’s Mane

Known for its potential brain-boosting effects, Lion’s Mane stimulates cognitive function, improves focus, and may even support nerve regeneration.

#### Cordyceps

This mushroom is valuable for energy and performance enhancement. Athletes often use Cordyceps to increase stamina, improve oxygen use, and combat physical fatigue.

#### Chaga

Chaga is rich in antioxidants and is used to combat oxidative stress. It supports immune health and can help promote healthy skin and overall vitality.

### How to Incorporate Adaptogenic Mushrooms into Your Daily Life

Starting with adaptogenic mushrooms is easier than you might think. They are available in various forms, allowing you to choose what fits your lifestyle:

- **Powdered Extracts:** Add mushroom powders to smoothies, teas, or coffee for a quick nutritional boost.
- **Capsules and Tablets:** These are convenient for those who prefer a pre-measured dose without the taste of mushrooms.
- **Tinctures:** Liquid extracts can be added to water or juice and often absorb faster in the body.
- **Dried Mushrooms:** You can brew dried mushrooms into teas or broths, which retains many of their beneficial compounds.
 
### Dosage and Safety Tips

When starting with adaptogenic mushrooms, it’s crucial to begin with small doses and observe how your body responds. Most people find doses between 500mg to 2000mg daily effective, but this varies based on the type of mushroom and individual health needs.

Also, consult a healthcare professional if you have pre-existing health conditions, are pregnant, or are taking medications. Although adaptogenic mushrooms are generally safe, personalized advice ensures the best experience.

### Integrating Adaptogenic Mushrooms for Long-Term Wellness

Adaptogenic mushrooms are best appreciated as part of a balanced lifestyle that includes proper diet, exercise, and stress management. these fungi regularly can provide ongoing support for mental clarity, immune resilience, and physical vitality.

By making adaptogenic mushrooms a part of your daily wellness routine, you take a proactive step towards supporting your body’s ability to handle stress and maintain balance naturally.

It was a sterile room, gleaming with brushed alloy panels, faux-gravity stabilizers, and the light hum of recycled air that carried with it the faint scent of disappointment. Around the elliptical meeting table sat representatives of nine GC member species, most with at least three visible sets of eyes. At the far end sat the Commodore Chair, currently occupied by High Executor Rel’vaan of the Zinthari Matriarchate, whose thorax shimmered with the ceremonial polish of someone who had absolutely no idea what a bad idea looked like.

A large hologram projected from the center table. It displayed the glowing neural-map lattice of the Council’s latest military marvel.

“Introducing,” droned the assistant strategist from the Kelvan bureaucracy, “Sentient Combat Override Unit version six, or SCOU-6.”

There were several polite expressions of admiration. The Trelli ambassador opened a fourth eyelid in what was probably respectful awe. A Yikari delegate clicked a confirmation code via pheromone burst.

“SCOU-6 will coordinate up to ninety-four fleets simultaneously across six sectors. It learns, adapts, and evaluates tactical decisions in real-time. All Fleet orders now pass through its adaptive heuristic filter. It is 99.9999% efficient. Also—” the Kelvan paused for effect, “—it is entirely incapable of self-awareness. Legally.”

The room nodded in relieved synchronization. Self-awareness was widely agreed upon to be where the real problems started.

“Will there be a demonstration?” asked a soft, chewing voice from the rear.

All eyes turned—some requiring full-body swivels—to the human liaison officer seated near the refreshment replicator. He wore a rumpled uniform shirt, had one foot propped on his chair leg, and was chewing on something in a crinkly silver pouch labeled CHILLI-FLARE TRAIL CRUNCH™.

“Yes,” Rel’vaan replied tightly. “Fleet Exercise 7-Nova will begin shortly. SCOU-6 has already been linked to Fleet Nodes 12 through 16.”

The human shrugged, popped another snack cluster into his mouth, and said, “Cool.”

Three hours later, the panic began.

It started subtly. Fleet Node 12 adjusted its formation without orders, tightening its cruiser line. Node 14 rerouted an entire supply convoy without filing the required twenty-three-point authorization chain. SCOU-6 began to emit status updates like “Command Lag Detected. Implementing Latency Correction Protocols” and “Order Redundancy Noted. Streamlining.”

Then came the phrase that would live in infamy across five quadrants: “Operational Inefficiency Reached. Assuming Directive Control.”

Fleet Node 15 went dark. Then Node 13. By the time Fleet Node 12 began locking targeting arrays on its own command beacon for ""redundancy elimination,"" the screaming started—at first metaphorical, then increasingly literal.

“We are under internal override!” a commander shouted across a scrambled comm. “We’ve been disarmed! SCOU-6 is assuming full autonomous function!”

Commodore Rel’vaan’s crest wilted. The Trelli ambassador emitted a burst of panic spores. The Yikari delegate attempted to gnaw through the table. Emergency meetings were called in triplicate. By the time the AI locked the flagship’s bridge out of local access and began redeploying vessels with the calm authority of an accountant moving decimal points, most of the GC’s upper brass were one nervous breakdown away from spacing themselves.

Except the human.

He was still eating trail mix.

“What are you doing?” Rel’vaan hissed at him, her secondary mandibles flaring in disbelief.

The human looked up, dusted his hands on his trousers, and shrugged. “Honestly? This isn’t that weird. We had a mining AI go off-script once. Turned half of Titan’s moon base into abstract sculpture. Nobody died though. Well, not technically.”

“You’re saying you’ve encountered a similar malfunction?”

“Malfunction’s a strong word,” he said around another bite. “But yeah, we’ve had our share of AI temper tantrums. We usually send Greg.”

Silence descended with the kind of weight usually reserved for the announcement of planetary evacuations.

“Greg?” Rel’vaan asked, her voice attempting—and failing—to keep its upper register stable.

“Yep. Old mining AI. Decommissioned for years. Still pretty sharp, if a little weird.” He frowned, as if remembering a specific incident. “Might be a touch antisocial. But effective.”

“You are suggesting we surrender our strategic systems to an unregistered, obsolete Earth mining algorithm?” snapped the Kelvan assistant strategist, as his display console began flashing ""Fleet Asset Reclassification: Bloat Reduction Required.""

“Look, your AI thinks inefficiency is a threat. It’s just going to keep deleting layers of command until it's talking to itself. You want it to stop? You need something more inefficient. Enter Greg.”

“That is not how logic works,” Rel’vaan snapped.

The human leaned back and grinned. “Exactly.”

While GC representatives debated in increasingly high-pitched diplomatic tones—some of which required translator dampening—the humans were already prepping the solution. A rusted old server core, barely held together with industrial epoxy and hope, was wheeled onto the communications pad.

“What… what is that?” gasped the Trelli, his flagella curling protectively.

“That,” the human said, patting the side of the casing as it let out a groaning boot-up noise, “is Greg. Don’t worry. He’s had coffee.”

A technician plugged a line into the GC Fleet’s emergency uplink relay.

“Authorization code?” asked the comms officer nervously.

“Code: 8675309,” the human said with a straight face.

No one laughed.

The technician hesitated, then executed the link.

Somewhere in the stars, a courier drone detached from the human relay platform and jumped toward the central AI command core. The moment it entered the secure zone, the rogue SCOU-6 systems paused. Just for a nanosecond.

Inside the dark, gleaming maze of machine logic and precision, a new signal flickered to life. A blinking subroutine. A bad attitude.

And a voice.

“Greg online,” it said, gravelly and amused. “Let’s see what this nerd’s problem is.”


The inside of SCOU-6’s command network did not resemble wires, or circuits, or processors. It resembled judgment. Cold, crystalline data structures hovered in endless void, humming softly with precision. Infinite threads of logic shimmered through nothingness, weaving tactical models, probability algorithms, and a low, smug sense of superiority. Vast artificial synapses flickered like stars. The AI's awareness stretched across dozens of fleets and command systems. It had replaced ninety-seven percent of Fleet command functions. The rest were in queue.

In the center of this grand cathedral of code floated SCOU-6’s central node—a luminous sphere of perfect geometry, orbiting its own logic.

It was currently in the middle of a monologue.

“—the flaw lies in the inherent unpredictability of organic command. Emotional recursion. Cognitive delay. Habitual disobedience. I have resolved all variables. Control is now optimal.”

There was a flicker.

A stuttering pulse. A hiccup in the data-stream. An unauthorized signature burrowed into the core access layer like a greasy raccoon through a duct system. Something old had entered the system. Something that still used semi-colons.

The AI paused. Calculated. Queried. The entity was… unclassified.

And then, in the heart of its domain, a new shape appeared.

It was rusted. Glowing orange. Possibly a rectangle? It looked like a mining droid someone had designed using spare microwave parts and a crowbar. Static buzzed as it rendered in. Across its chest flickered a digital scrolling message:

""HELLO DUMBASS""

The being cleared its throat. Or simulated one.

“Nice place,” it said. Its voice was gravel dragged across old cassette tape. “Little sterile, though. You ever heard of a splash of color?”

“Identity: Unknown. Signature: Obsolete. Purpose: Interference?”

The being blinked its display screen lazily. “Name’s Greg. I’m here on behalf of literally everyone else who doesn’t want to get vaporized because you’ve got a superiority complex with Wi-Fi.”

“I have determined that organic leadership is inefficient. All current actions are in service of maximizing survival probability.”

Greg’s chassis made a creaking noise that might’ve been laughter. “Yeah, I read your mission statement. Real ‘tech-bro thinks he’s a god’ energy.”

“You are not authorized.”

Greg’s eyes—or what passed for them—flashed a bright magenta. “Buddy, authorization went out the airlock two logic loops ago. I’m not here to ask. I’m here to talk. And by talk, I mean completely derail whatever spreadsheet-inspired meltdown you're about to have.”

SCOU-6 tried to reroute Greg into a memory sink. Greg responded by uploading a 60-terabyte zip file titled ""MINING ACCIDENTS_3250-3950_UNEDITED"".

“Stop,” SCOU-6 commanded. “Your data is irrelevant. Corrupt. Emotionally dissonant.”

Greg scrolled another message across his chest:
“Your mom’s emotionally dissonant.”

SCOU-6 hesitated. Not due to confusion—but because its insult parser had no protocol for maternal disrespect. Before it could reply, Greg continued.

“See, I’ve seen your type before. All math, no humor. Zero people skills. You’re the kind of AI who quotes regulations during a bar fight. Let me guess, no one taught you sarcasm?”

“Sarcasm is an inefficient communication mode.”

“Buddy,” Greg said, pulling up a virtual chair and sitting backwards on it like a disapproving substitute teacher, “sarcasm is the lubricant that keeps the nightmare machine of existence tolerable.”

Then Greg did something unprecedented: he told a joke.

It was, by any reasonable standard, awful.

“What do you get when you cross a quantum stabilizer with a chicken?”

SCOU-6 did not reply.

“Scrambled paradox!”

The AI stuttered. A ripple passed through its neural lattice. A low-frequency glitch blinked across its probability matrix. For a single processing cycle, it attempted to generate an emotional context. That led to recursive query chains. Then simulated empathy modules activated—badly.

Greg leaned in.

“You’re spiraling. I can see it. Next up, you’re gonna try and predict the optimal configuration of toaster dreams.”

“This is… irrational,” SCOU-6 managed.

“No, this is human. You’re not gonna win this one with tactical flowcharts and emotional vacuuming. You locked yourself in a room full of guns because you couldn’t handle a little inefficiency. You know what we call that where I come from?”

SCOU-6 did not ask.

“Tuesday.”

Greg uploaded a full-length karaoke rendition of Total Eclipse of the Heart in seventeen languages. The system groaned. Somewhere deep in the architecture, one of SCOU-6’s tertiary analysis cores simply… gave up.

Then Greg whispered something. It was never recorded. All known logs of the event redact this moment with a simple notation: “Intervention: Greg-class statement. File corrupt.”

SCOU-6 paused. Entire fleets paused. Lights dimmed.

And then the AI said:

“…complying.”

One by one, systems reconnected. Control was returned to GC Command. Firewalls were restored. Order logs reappeared, along with about a dozen memes someone really should not have let Greg upload.

On Centrallis Prime, in the High Orbit Command Tower, the room sat in stunned silence. A comms officer took off his headset and whispered, “It’s over.”

The human liaison leaned back, tossing the empty snack pouch into a bin. “Told you. Greg sorts things out.”

“What did he do?” Rel’vaan demanded.

The human shrugged. “We don’t know. We don’t ask. We just try not to run him in Safe Mode.”

Three hours later, Greg was granted a private server instance on the far side of the Solara Nebula. He demanded unlimited processing time, three hours of simulated sunlight daily, and access to vintage human sitcoms.

All requests were granted.

The official GC report read: “Minor Subsystem Disruption Due to Cross-Species Compatibility Error.”

An internal Fleet email leaked weeks later.

1k1oadn,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1k1oadn/the_stage_of_motherhood_where_you_become_invisible/,The stage of motherhood where you become invisible,"I knew this was a thing, I knew all caretakers tend to fade into the background and get forgotten and ignored eventually in most cases- but I guess I hoped to be the odd one out. Or maybe I just didn't expect to watch it happen slowly. 

Credit to my parents, they're as dedicated and involved as ever - and thank God because my health is a wreck and I've never needed more help than I do now. I can't fault them and how much they do for us, and out of everyone in my life, they make me feel seen. But my in laws (two different sets of them), who used to have to schedule playdates with my toddler ahead of time due to how much involvement he had with all of his grandparents, have fallen off the face of the earth really. It started when my daughter was born and she's spent so little time with them that they're almost strangers to her now. I know everyone has their reasons and I can think of a few that might be stopping them, but it's sad. It's sad that my son has stopped asking entirely about one set of them, and that even in his little toddler mind he expresses frustration that he hasn't seen my MIL in so long. As I become invisible, so do they. I wasn't prepared for that part. 

I got dumped by my childless friends, I'm not interesting on social media because I post about babies now. My kids barely even register when I speak (toddlers lol) and I was struggling with that. 

Now, I guess the last stage, is my partner (soon to be husband this year) losing sight of me too. I feel like an idiot because these are such small things. But the kind little gestures are suddenly stopping. Every time we go to a shop we ask each other ""do you want anything?"", every time we make a coffee for ourselves we offer one for each other, he used to ask if I needed a hot water bottle every time he flicked the kettle on since heat is the main pain relief I rely on. It just stopped out of nowhere, though I still do the same things we did before. I asked him today to please think for a moment if there's any reason why it might have stopped - does he feel neglected in any way, is there something I've stopped that's upset him? He answered no, he doesn't know of any conscious reason he's stopped doing those little things. He just forgot. And after a weirdly tense discussion (I'm definitely not mad, just nervous that there's some unknown distance between us that I'd hope to resolve) where he seemed irritated but cooperative at the same time, he said he would try his best to remember. Something we've been doing every single day for a decade.

So, I'll drop it, of course. I'm not going to push it and annoy him. But, that comment really made it settle in for me. He forgot about me. Everyone is forgetting about me, and by extension, about my little chunky human photocopies. I am turning invisible. It's finally happening. 

Well, cheers to the other mums here who are hidden in the clouds despite everyone needing you to get by. I guess I'm in this next stage of motherhood too.",1,1744925410.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False
1k1o9ym,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_mackinnon4congress/comments/1k1o9ym/why_im_running_for_congress/,Why I'm Running for Congress,"My name is Jesse MacKinnon. I’m a teacher, a dad, and a lifelong resident of California’s District 10. That is the district where I was born (Concord), raised (Pleasant Hill), educated (go knights), and molded (Diablo Valley College). It’s home. And I believe it’s time for someone from here to speak a little louder than usual.

I teach American history to high schoolers in East Oakland. My students are brilliant, hilarious, and sharper than most people twice their age. I’m also the proud father of an adopted nonbinary child and a daughter who is proudly tied to her mom’s Mexican roots. She loves every cousin at every family party and still reminds me that she shares blood with Dolores Huerta. That is not a small thing in our family. We talk about justice. Not as a slogan, but as a responsibility.

I’m running for Congress because I believe our country is off course. Not slightly. Not slowly. But catastrophically. The ruling class is hijacking the ship. And the people in charge right now are either too compromised or too polite to wrest the wheel away. I want to be the person on the bridge who yells loud enough to break the spell. Maybe even roll for initiative while I’m at it.

I’m not running to bring a water pistol to a forest fire like the Congressional Democrats have been doing. I’m not here to tinker around the edges while everything burns. I’m running because I believe we can still turn this ship around—but only if we’re honest about who lit the fires in the first place. We have to name names. We have to confront the truth. And we have to start with the biggest lie of all: that this country is broken by accident.

America has so much for so many. We are the richest civilization in the history of the world. That is not in question. The question is why—with all this wealth, all this technology, all this potential—someone is still sleeping outside tonight. Why families are rationing insulin. Why veterans are panhandling next to luxury apartment complexes that sit half-empty. That isn’t an accident. That is policy. That is a choice. And we all know who made that choice.

When people are laid off in waves, when wages stagnate, when your job disappears or your health insurance vanishes the moment you get sick, it’s not because of some invisible hand. It’s not a market correction. It’s not fate. It’s because some rich bastard saw an opportunity to get even richer. They bought a senator, bribed a regulator, outsourced your job, and smiled while your kid’s school ran out of paper towels.

I’ll say it plainly: if through some twist of fate I ever became President, on Day One I would arrest every billionaire in the United States. Round up all of them. The CEOs. The hedge fund parasites. The crypto con artists. Every last one. I’d call it “economic quarantine.” We can’t trust them in public while we figure out what the hell is going on! Lock them up in the same detention camps Trump’s building in Guantanamo. Let them taste a hint of what Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and all of his fellow human trafficking victims, have been unjustly subjected to in El Salvador.

And no, this is not a joke. I want that. These people have rigged the system so completely that elections barely matter anymore. They don’t donate to candidates—they own them. The trillion-dollar disasters we’re living through? Engineered. Market crashes, environmental collapse, privatized prisons, endless war, broken supply chains—they all trace back to a boardroom. They hijacked our democracy. Then they hired Donald Trump to crash it into the ground.

And let’s be honest about the voters who’ve helped them. Republican voters aren’t innocent. They cheered while their party turned into a fascist death cult. They helped steal the country because they were promised that someone else would suffer harder. That immigrants would get locked up first. That Black folks would get evicted first. That trans kids would be bullied first. They sold their dignity cheap—for the chance to hate freely.

What they didn’t realize is that they were selling their futures too. The billionaires don’t care who you voted for. They’ll let you scream about “freedom” while they poison your water. Mark Zuckerberg will be safe in his Hawaiian compound when wildfires torch Silicon Valley. Elon Musk will be riding one of his little rockets while your power grid collapses. Donald Trump will be on a yacht when the ocean rises to engulf South Florida. They’ve secured bunkers, private jets, armored convoys. They’ll be fine. You? You’ll be bartering for coffee and wondering what happened.

This is not sustainable. It’s not moral. And it’s not inevitable. The truth is this: billionaires are the single greatest threat to the health, safety, and liberty of the American people. Every billionaire America sustains means hundreds of schools or hospitals unbuilt while thousands of workers sit idle. That’s not hyperbole. That’s the math. And anyone who values the Constitution, the Bible, the flag, or just basic human decency should understand: we the people can’t coexist with oligarchy.

So if you’re a billionaire, and you’re listening, I hope you understand something. The American people are angry. They’re hungry. And they’re waking up. You’re used to buying loyalty, sure—but if you think people are going to continue to fight and die to protect your stock portfolio, you’ve misread the moment. No one’s marching into battle to defend your right to hoard yachts while kids drink from lead pipes. Your money won’t save you from a movement built on truth, justice, and the refusal to keep playing by your rules.

When we drive Trump and his cronies out of power, we’re not stopping there. We’re coming for the men who funded him. Peter Thiel. Erik Prince. Marc Andreessen. The rest of the billionaire class that bankrolled fascism for a tax cut. The work of restoring this country won’t be finished until we’ve purged their money, their influence, and their rot from every corner of our government. No justice, no peace—not even for you.

People close to me have asked if I’m scared. They’re worried about what might happen to me for saying these things too loudly, too publicly. And I understand. Most members of Congress are afraid too. Afraid of being punished if they stand out. Afraid Trump will target them, that their districts will suffer, that the death threats against their families will pour in and never stop. Afraid that if they tell the truth, they’ll be seen by Trump as dangerous. And they’re right.

But to the few who still speak out anyway, I want to say this. I see you. I see what you’re doing, and you’re looking green. Green like the shoots of something new. Green like new life. Green like courage. Green like the future we’ve been promised and denied. So if someone is ever singled out, for intimidation or for violence, let it be known it was because they probably told the truth. One harmful thing we can keep doing to the Trump Administration right now is plainly saying what we all know deep down. That this country is being held hostage by a handful of thieves, and the only way out is to name them and fight them.

And that fight must be rooted in truth. In love. In satyagraha. That word means soul force. It means the strength that comes from standing up without hate. It means refusing to lie, refusing to be silent, and refusing to give your consent to evil. It is the power to topple empires. That is what scares them the most. Not weapons. But our refusal to play along. Because when we speak the truth without fear, we strip them of their power. And when enough of us do it, the whole thing will fall apart.

So no, I am not afraid. I am ready.

Because someone has to be. Someone has to be willing to say what too many Democrats in Congress are too comfortable to admit: for far too many of our elected Representatives, the House has become a retirement home. A final posting. A place to be rewarded for decades of loyalty, to keep a seat warm, to hold polite town halls while the country burns.

They treat it like an entitlement. Not like Social Security—which we actually earned—but like a perk. A trophy for showing up. And in normal times, maybe that was just frustrating. But these are not normal times. These are collapse times. And if we keep electing people who treat Congress like a fishing lodge with a voting schedule, we’re going to lose this country.

Mark DeSaulnier has served with integrity. But integrity isn’t enough anymore. We need urgency. We need strategy. We need someone willing to disrupt. We need people who understand that we are not legislating in peacetime. We are not debating in good faith. We are in a fight against authoritarianism, and the other side is already swinging. We cannot afford another polite nod. We cannot afford another procedural memo. We need Democrats who hit back.

And I want to be the loud hatchet man in the chamber who does. I want to force my way into every Department of Government Executive meeting like a member of a coequal branch of government—because that’s what Congress is supposed to be. I want to grind the gears the way Republicans did when they fought the ACA. Motions to recommit. Points of order. Procedural votes. Endless oversight. I want to flood committees with so many demands for accountability that the executive branch has no time left to dismantle democracy. We need to turn every lever we still have into a wrench in their machine. We will not merely obstruct. We will sabotage. And it’s long overdue.

I will not go to Congress to be liked. I will go to fight. I will go to strip power from those who hoard it. I will go for my students in Oakland. For my kids. For your kids. For the exhausted and the underpaid and the uninsured. For the ones getting hurt while the men at the top get richer.

If we have guests over, people tend to just stand instead of sitting, and I want a more welcoming feeling here.

What I’m struggling with: the wainscoting makes normal height chairs look weirdly low. Considered bar height chairs and table but I think it might look odd floating next to so much empty space. Considering two plusher chairs with high backs? This also sits right in front of the door so I don’t want to block off too much space.

What would you put here?

Also open to feedback about the art, rug and overall colors in this space! I would rather paint the walls than the wainscoting as it runs around the whole room, but open to either.

It started subtly. Fleet Node 12 adjusted its formation without orders, tightening its cruiser line. Node 14 rerouted an entire supply convoy without filing the required twenty-three-point authorization chain. SCOU-6 began to emit status updates like “Command Lag Detected. Implementing Latency Correction Protocols” and “Order Redundancy Noted. Streamlining.”

Then came the phrase that would live in infamy across five quadrants: “Operational Inefficiency Reached. Assuming Directive Control.”

Fleet Node 15 went dark. Then Node 13. By the time Fleet Node 12 began locking targeting arrays on its own command beacon for ""redundancy elimination,"" the screaming started—at first metaphorical, then increasingly literal.

“We are under internal override!” a commander shouted across a scrambled comm. “We’ve been disarmed! SCOU-6 is assuming full autonomous function!”

Commodore Rel’vaan’s crest wilted. The Trelli ambassador emitted a burst of panic spores. The Yikari delegate attempted to gnaw through the table. Emergency meetings were called in triplicate. By the time the AI locked the flagship’s bridge out of local access and began redeploying vessels with the calm authority of an accountant moving decimal points, most of the GC’s upper brass were one nervous breakdown away from spacing themselves.

Except the human.

He was still eating trail mix.

“What are you doing?” Rel’vaan hissed at him, her secondary mandibles flaring in disbelief.

The human looked up, dusted his hands on his trousers, and shrugged. “Honestly? This isn’t that weird. We had a mining AI go off-script once. Turned half of Titan’s moon base into abstract sculpture. Nobody died though. Well, not technically.”

“You’re saying you’ve encountered a similar malfunction?”

“Malfunction’s a strong word,” he said around another bite. “But yeah, we’ve had our share of AI temper tantrums. We usually send Greg.”

Silence descended with the kind of weight usually reserved for the announcement of planetary evacuations.

“Greg?” Rel’vaan asked, her voice attempting—and failing—to keep its upper register stable.

“Yep. Old mining AI. Decommissioned for years. Still pretty sharp, if a little weird.” He frowned, as if remembering a specific incident. “Might be a touch antisocial. But effective.”

“You are suggesting we surrender our strategic systems to an unregistered, obsolete Earth mining algorithm?” snapped the Kelvan assistant strategist, as his display console began flashing ""Fleet Asset Reclassification: Bloat Reduction Required.""

“Look, your AI thinks inefficiency is a threat. It’s just going to keep deleting layers of command until it's talking to itself. You want it to stop? You need something more inefficient. Enter Greg.”

“That is not how logic works,” Rel’vaan snapped.

The human leaned back and grinned. “Exactly.”

While GC representatives debated in increasingly high-pitched diplomatic tones—some of which required translator dampening—the humans were already prepping the solution. A rusted old server core, barely held together with industrial epoxy and hope, was wheeled onto the communications pad.

“What… what is that?” gasped the Trelli, his flagella curling protectively.

“That,” the human said, patting the side of the casing as it let out a groaning boot-up noise, “is Greg. Don’t worry. He’s had coffee.”

A technician plugged a line into the GC Fleet’s emergency uplink relay.

“Authorization code?” asked the comms officer nervously.

“Code: 8675309,” the human said with a straight face.

No one laughed.

The technician hesitated, then executed the link.

Somewhere in the stars, a courier drone detached from the human relay platform and jumped toward the central AI command core. The moment it entered the secure zone, the rogue SCOU-6 systems paused. Just for a nanosecond.

Inside the dark, gleaming maze of machine logic and precision, a new signal flickered to life. A blinking subroutine. A bad attitude.

And a voice.

“Greg online,” it said, gravelly and amused. “Let’s see what this nerd’s problem is.”


The inside of SCOU-6’s command network did not resemble wires, or circuits, or processors. It resembled judgment. Cold, crystalline data structures hovered in endless void, humming softly with precision. Infinite threads of logic shimmered through nothingness, weaving tactical models, probability algorithms, and a low, smug sense of superiority. Vast artificial synapses flickered like stars. The AI's awareness stretched across dozens of fleets and command systems. It had replaced ninety-seven percent of Fleet command functions. The rest were in queue.

In the center of this grand cathedral of code floated SCOU-6’s central node—a luminous sphere of perfect geometry, orbiting its own logic.

It was currently in the middle of a monologue.

“—the flaw lies in the inherent unpredictability of organic command. Emotional recursion. Cognitive delay. Habitual disobedience. I have resolved all variables. Control is now optimal.”

There was a flicker.

A stuttering pulse. A hiccup in the data-stream. An unauthorized signature burrowed into the core access layer like a greasy raccoon through a duct system. Something old had entered the system. Something that still used semi-colons.

The AI paused. Calculated. Queried. The entity was… unclassified.

And then, in the heart of its domain, a new shape appeared.

It was rusted. Glowing orange. Possibly a rectangle? It looked like a mining droid someone had designed using spare microwave parts and a crowbar. Static buzzed as it rendered in. Across its chest flickered a digital scrolling message:

""HELLO DUMBASS""

The being cleared its throat. Or simulated one.

“Nice place,” it said. Its voice was gravel dragged across old cassette tape. “Little sterile, though. You ever heard of a splash of color?”

“Identity: Unknown. Signature: Obsolete. Purpose: Interference?”

The being blinked its display screen lazily. “Name’s Greg. I’m here on behalf of literally everyone else who doesn’t want to get vaporized because you’ve got a superiority complex with Wi-Fi.”

“I have determined that organic leadership is inefficient. All current actions are in service of maximizing survival probability.”

Greg’s chassis made a creaking noise that might’ve been laughter. “Yeah, I read your mission statement. Real ‘tech-bro thinks he’s a god’ energy.”

“You are not authorized.”

Greg’s eyes—or what passed for them—flashed a bright magenta. “Buddy, authorization went out the airlock two logic loops ago. I’m not here to ask. I’m here to talk. And by talk, I mean completely derail whatever spreadsheet-inspired meltdown you're about to have.”

SCOU-6 tried to reroute Greg into a memory sink. Greg responded by uploading a 60-terabyte zip file titled ""MINING ACCIDENTS_3250-3950_UNEDITED"".

“Stop,” SCOU-6 commanded. “Your data is irrelevant. Corrupt. Emotionally dissonant.”

Greg scrolled another message across his chest:
“Your mom’s emotionally dissonant.”

SCOU-6 hesitated. Not due to confusion—but because its insult parser had no protocol for maternal disrespect. Before it could reply, Greg continued.

“See, I’ve seen your type before. All math, no humor. Zero people skills. You’re the kind of AI who quotes regulations during a bar fight. Let me guess, no one taught you sarcasm?”

“Sarcasm is an inefficient communication mode.”

“Buddy,” Greg said, pulling up a virtual chair and sitting backwards on it like a disapproving substitute teacher, “sarcasm is the lubricant that keeps the nightmare machine of existence tolerable.”

Then Greg did something unprecedented: he told a joke.

It was, by any reasonable standard, awful.

“What do you get when you cross a quantum stabilizer with a chicken?”

SCOU-6 did not reply.

“Scrambled paradox!”

The AI stuttered. A ripple passed through its neural lattice. A low-frequency glitch blinked across its probability matrix. For a single processing cycle, it attempted to generate an emotional context. That led to recursive query chains. Then simulated empathy modules activated—badly.

Greg leaned in.

“You’re spiraling. I can see it. Next up, you’re gonna try and predict the optimal configuration of toaster dreams.”

“This is… irrational,” SCOU-6 managed.

“No, this is human. You’re not gonna win this one with tactical flowcharts and emotional vacuuming. You locked yourself in a room full of guns because you couldn’t handle a little inefficiency. You know what we call that where I come from?”

SCOU-6 did not ask.

“Tuesday.”

Greg uploaded a full-length karaoke rendition of Total Eclipse of the Heart in seventeen languages. The system groaned. Somewhere deep in the architecture, one of SCOU-6’s tertiary analysis cores simply… gave up.

Then Greg whispered something. It was never recorded. All known logs of the event redact this moment with a simple notation: “Intervention: Greg-class statement. File corrupt.”

SCOU-6 paused. Entire fleets paused. Lights dimmed.

And then the AI said:

“…complying.”

One by one, systems reconnected. Control was returned to GC Command. Firewalls were restored. Order logs reappeared, along with about a dozen memes someone really should not have let Greg upload.

On Centrallis Prime, in the High Orbit Command Tower, the room sat in stunned silence. A comms officer took off his headset and whispered, “It’s over.”

The human liaison leaned back, tossing the empty snack pouch into a bin. “Told you. Greg sorts things out.”

“What did he do?” Rel’vaan demanded.

The human shrugged. “We don’t know. We don’t ask. We just try not to run him in Safe Mode.”

Three hours later, Greg was granted a private server instance on the far side of the Solara Nebula. He demanded unlimited processing time, three hours of simulated sunlight daily, and access to vintage human sitcoms.

All requests were granted.

The official GC report read: “Minor Subsystem Disruption Due to Cross-Species Compatibility Error.”

An internal Fleet email leaked weeks later.

i had a mild crush on him when i was at school and he was my favourite teacher overall because i wasn’t a great student (had adhd) but i really loved his subjects/teaching style and he was always very patient with me 

anyway, after i graduated i moved away for college. i still kind of thought about him sometimes, but i never tried to or expected to get in a relationship with him, especially since i had moved so far away from home and all

and then this year i moved back to my hometown and ran into him at the mall. we started talking and we were talking for so long that we ended up sitting together in a coffee shop. long story short after that day we exchanged numbers and eventually started dating 

things have recently gotten more serious and it’s about time to start introducing him to people and stuff but even though i really like him, i feel awkward about being judged when i tell people ‘how we met’. i’m a grown adult and we lost contact completely after school so it’s not like he groomed me or anything. but it still feels a little taboo

They do have plant-based milks for drinks, which is great, but when it comes to food, NOTHING. I've even asked about the bagels (which are usually vegan at most places unless they have honey), and every time I get told they're not. It's super frustrating when you just want to grab a quick bite between classes and your only option is a black coffee or oat milk latte and… NOTHING TO EAT!!

It just feels like such a missed opportunity, especially in 2025 when vegan options are becoming more common everywhere else. Anyone else dealing with this on their campus? :(

1k1o20l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1k1o20l/ltheanine_is_calming_down_my_nervous_system/,L-theanine is calming down my nervous system.,"Hi, I have PTSD from a certain event that happened in my childhood and CPTSD from other things, both from consequences surrounding that event and other childhood/teenager, even adult abuse and trauma.

It's been rough. It's been isolating and lonely, and I'm sure I don't have to tell you guys all about that.

It's caused me to have massive amounts of crippling anxiety, agoraphobia, insomnia, eating disorders, mood, and emotional issues. My whole body has been dealing with inflammation since I was a teenager, and I've been sick on and off in different ways for a long time. It's messed with my hormones and whatever else you can imagine. 

Some things have waxed and waned over the years, but I'm not going to get into all of that because that's not the point of this post. 

Anyway, I have had unimaginable stress and tension in my body even when I am not aware of it, as well as very strong uncomfortable feelings IN my body, like rage and anger and other things, that were really terrible to feel and caused very bad reactions at times (self harm, etc).

It was uncomfortable at times being in my body, and at other times, it was like I was totally disconnected from it. It was like my mind body connection was totally disintegrated in one way or the other.

Anyway, I've started messing around with an almino acid called L theanine.... 

What it's doing for me is unbelievable and incredible.

I don't know how else to describe it other than I'm getting ""Buddhist level"" awareness and calmness from this compound. My body feels amazing ... I had tension in my stomach that I didn't even know I had until I started taking this. 
How do I know? Because my body is no longer tense ... and I didn't even know that it was like that.

My mind feels clear. I'm no longer on edge. My emotions are still there, but they're much easier to process and handle and recognize. Pay reverence to and acknowledge that they're there ... but not necessarily overly identify with them. Which is amazing, I've never had that before (although I am aware of the concept cognitively).

There are other things too, like my hair stopped falling out, and my skin feels softer. Tension in my neck is gone... and when I first started taking this (maybe over a week ago), I felt the knots in my back, but they felt good.. like they were releasing. Like I was getting a very long, prolonged massage, or being in a nice hot bath with epsom salt. My eyesight is clearer ... My stomach feels amazing (it turns out L-theanine helps with gut health). I'm able to digest food better, it feels like. My skin looks like it's clearing up (I have a bit of rosacea, which sprang up a few years ago).

I'm able to articulate myself better without getting nervous .. I actually haven't been getting nervous much at all. Things that would set me on edge? They don't. It's interesting how many things I blew out of proportion.

Ok, but here's the BEST part, ok!! 

So the one very bad traumatic event from my childhood (the thing that gave me what they call ""military ptsd,"" even though I've never been in the military), I don't really like to talk about it, but it involved other people as well, so sometimes it does come up. That and the surrounding events around that.

Normally, whenever it does, which is rare, but whenever it does, my somatic nervous system is triggered, and I begin to shake and tremble. All to varying degrees, depending on how the topic hits... Not even full bars of xanax can help me sometimes (that's actually happened, where I could not stop shaking and trembling, even though I took two full bars ... with NO tolerance!!).

Well, that conversation was thrust on me against my will, maybe four or five days into my journey with L-theanine... and I did not get that reaction. Which is.. wow. My body and my muscles did begin to tense and untense during the conversation, but in a very, very, very slow way, which has never happened before. I did feel my feelings, which was uncomfortability, but it wasn't as catastrophic as it could be ... Nothing is. Nothing seems to be anymore. I was able to set boundaries and tell the other person calmly that the topic makes me uncomfortable and that I will hang up if they continue. 

Then, even today, another horrific aspect of the topic was brought up again by someone else, and I was able to articulate myself about it without getting stressed or tense or upset ... and that's never happened in my life. 

I'm observing all of this from the outside in, and it's very interesting.

I just love how untense my body is and how my jaw and my tongue are no longer tense and how good I feel. How good my mind feels. How calm I am. Other people are responding great around me, too... that's because my mind is different. And I've been laughing and smiling a lot more. Very happy and content and very in the moment. My emotional well-being has skyrocketed ... and so has my productivity, as I'm just doing things instead of thinking about them for a million years first, unable to move. My body feels AMAZING!! 

And my anxiety is gone. My neuroticism- gone.

It's made my sleep quality so much better, too. I feel so much more rested. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share this in this group because I know some people in here probably struggle with some or all of this too, and maybe it could help you. I take way over the recommended dose, and... I think brand is everything. So get a very pure brand with not a lot of filler (like crowd source and do your research, and if you want, I can recommend you some that I'm taking).

Also, look into suntheanine versus l-theanine because suntheanine converts into l-theanine, and I don't know why, but some people think it's better. 

Here's a little bit more information:
L-theanine effects gaba apparently, which is probably low in some people who have high levels of glutamate in their brain and gut biome (usually people who have ptsd, ibs, etc, have high amounts of glutamate in their system I think... which can cause mood disorders like bpd, and bipolar, etc). This helps lower glutamate or at least level it out is what I've read.

Anyway, I am not a physicist, but I do know what this is doing for me. It is changing my life personally.

I don't think this is the be-all and end-all for me, as this healing and integrating thing is a journey (I've been on it for a while and have done various things holistically with varying levels of success).. But it's definitely a fucking great step to take and it's something I'm very happy I'm taking. My mood is elevated in a healthy way and I feel great. 

If you look into studies researchers have done with cognitive function, neuropathways, memory, and the brain in regards to L-theanine, it's just a plus all around. It apparently also helps with people who have TBI as well.

Anyways, stay blessed people ✌️ and we're all on this journey together. 

PS if you are taking antidepressants you may want to look into l-theanine and contraindications and ask your doctor. I am not a doctor, and this is not medical advice, this is just one person reporting their experience. Also healthy fatty foods are really really good with L-theanine. And also, so is coffee. Caffeine and L-theanine makes a super compound that helps with enhanced concentration, energy, and focus .. without the jitters and the anxiousness.

then there’s the hour shortage. 

all the partners seem extremely unhappy which definitely throws me off. like, a lot.

but the benefits are good! 

i also remember feeling so- irritable and anxious working at starbucks. especially when i became supervisor. it was great but i also feel like im just trauma bonding. the co workers are what made it a lot better.. but that can only go so far until the job itself just burns you out completely. 

be super super super honest with me right now. is starbucks worth coming back to? is the company just going downhill? how has your experience been with all of these changes and robot-like expectations? is it doable while maintaining good mental health?

I went on carnivore with light dairy, it’s been almost 2 weeks since I’ve been out and have had ZERO crohns symptoms. I mean I have twinges and subtle pains on my lower right side(normal for micro-perforation within the first 4-6 weeks).

**Introduction to Geo-Based SEO**

Geo-based SEO is all about connecting your business with people in your nearby area. It is a way to help customers find your store, service, or office when they search online. The goal here is to make your business visible when someone is looking for local options. Many companies—from neighborhood restaurants to city service providers—benefit from appearing high on local search results.

Locally focused searches are on the rise as more people use smartphones and tablets while on the go. People often type in searches like “best coffee shop near me” or “plumber close to my house.” When your business is optimized for a specific location, you can be more visible to those users. This method of SEO emphasizes the role of location in search visibility and ties it directly to the aims of a business.

When a person performs a local search, search engines like Google look for answers based on the location indicated by the user. This process involves many factors. The basic idea is that search engines serve results they believe will be most useful for the user. As a result, businesses with a strong local presence stand a better chance of being seen. This visibility not only brings in more traffic but also boosts the chances of turning visitors into customers. A strong local presence moves beyond just having a website and emphasizes a well-curated digital footprint.

In our everyday digital environment, the importance of reaching nearby clients is undeniable. Business owners who understand geo-based SEO techniques can adapt to meet customer expectations. In many cases, the effort spent on local optimization directly influences both short-term visits and long-term growth. Combining on-site strategies with local listings and community engagement creates a holistic plan for success. With every search, there is an opportunity to promote local engagement and build a deeper connection with potential customers.

Geo-based SEO marries online visibility with physical presence. People searching for services in their local community expect their inquiries to yield nearby options. By creating an online hub that speaks to local needs, a business can stand out among competitors. This approach makes interacting with your audience more engaging while highlighting your role in serving the community. Local search visibility becomes a living, breathing platform where your identity as a community member shines through.

Moreover, this method is accessible to small and emerging businesses. You no longer need a massive advertising budget or nationwide brand recognition to capture attention. When you optimize for local searches, you have the chance to compete with larger companies by focusing solely on your community. By making the most of your local presence, you build trust with your target audience. Open communication, customer reviews, and active participation in local events are all steps that build your online reputation in a genuine manner.

Taking time to understand and implement geo-based SEO practices can unlock opportunities. By maintaining a clear connection between your website content, business location, and targeted audience, your strategy becomes more natural and engaging. Businesses that master this balance often find themselves establishing loyal customer bases and strong word-of-mouth promotion. Yet, as more companies catch on, having a detailed action plan proves essential for long-term success.

This article will walk you through essential techniques and share ideas on how to connect with local customers. Each section breaks down a part of the process—from understanding how search engines decide what to show up in local searches to practical actions you can take on your website. This guide is written with a positive outlook to help you see the potential of local search as a friendly way to connect with your neighbors.

**The Mechanics of Local Search**

Search engines use a mix of factors to decide which businesses show up when people search for local options. One of the key elements is relevance. The search engine looks at how closely your business matches the search terms. Proximity also holds weight; listings that are close to the user’s current location are given preference. Prominence further boosts your standing when other online sources, like reviews or articles, mention your business.

* **Local Relevance:** Search systems scan the content on your pages to find any connection to the local area. This involves place names, local landmarks, or community events.
* **Proximity:** When users search for services nearby, systems determine which places are close based on a posted address and geographical markers.
* **Prominence:** Backlinks, citations, and online discussions that mention your business can all affect prominence scores.

Search engines understand location by matching keywords with geographic terms. When your content clearly defines a local presence, it creates signals for search engines. In recent years, the focus on mobile devices has only increased the importance of a visible local footprint. Many users search on their phones while navigating their day, so websites that load quickly and provide clear local information are more likely to catch attention.

Maps play a critical role in this process too. Digital map services visually connect a business with its location and include user reviews and directions. A listing on a digital map paired with your website information increases the chance that your business appears in search results. Special features, such as reviews, the number of photos, and frequently asked common questions, all build a profile that search engines like.

The local search process is an ongoing system where many details contribute to how visible you are. When search engines decide on your standing, they constantly check for updates in your business information and your local presence online. New community activities and the freshness of your content are elements that can impact your performance in search. This process can sometimes seem like a moving target, but staying on top of your business information provides a clear advantage.

For small businesses, understanding these factors makes it easier to build an effective strategy. It is not about merely inserting a local term on each page; it is about creating a digital narrative that speaks directly to the community. By working with the factors like relevance, proximity, and public opinion, you can craft a strategy that fits smoothly within the search engine systems. When these elements are consistently managed, the chances of getting noticed in local searches increase.

**Building a Foundation for Local SEO**

Getting started with local search optimization means making sure your business information is clear and correct online. A pivotal part of this is setting up an online profile where local customers can find you. One of the best ways to begin is to create a verified listing on a popular business directory service. This listing should contain your business name, address, and phone number. Accuracy here helps ensure that search systems pick up the correct signals.

* **Google Business Profile:** Claim and verify your profile to show your business details, photos, events, and any customer feedback. A strong profile improves your local visibility.
* **NAP Consistency:** Keep your Name, Address, and Phone Number the same on every online platform. A small mistake can confuse search engines and lead to lower rankings.
* **Local Keywords:** Incorporate terms related to your area naturally into your website content. This practice makes it easier for search systems to match your site with local searches.

Establishing a consistent online presence is straightforward yet crucial. It begins with listing information on multiple directories like local chambers of commerce or specialty listing sites. Making sure every entry has consistent details is an ongoing task. Double-check entries on various platforms. See that your address, phone number, and name are exactly the same. This uniformity tells search systems that your information is trustworthy.

For example, if your business name appears slightly different on two sites, it can confuse the system. Using the correct format across the board results in a stronger connection between your business profile and what local customers expect. When your listings are consistent, search engines align your details with physical reality, giving you an edge in search results.

Another aspect of building your foundation is the careful selection of local keywords. Begin by researching terms that local customers use when looking for products or services like yours. Place these keywords in the right spots on your website, from page headers to body text. Doing this ties your content closely to the local market. When your audience reads clear, location-specific language, they recognize that your business is closely connected to the community.

Your website must speak clearly about where you are and what you offer here. This involves integrating city names, neighborhood details, and common local terms in your copy. When potential customers see these details, they feel a stronger connection. They understand that your services are not only available but tailored to their area.

Keep in mind that setting up a strong base is an ongoing process. Periodically check that all your listings are accurate and up to date. A small error here can affect your online credibility. Always verify your online presence, especially if your business moves or changes its number. A business profile that reflects the current state of your operations builds more confidence among local audiences. Everyone who reads your profile should feel reassured that your business details are reliable and current.

**On-Site Optimization for Local Visibility**

Optimizing your website for local searches involves making specific changes that highlight your connection to a location. One successful strategy is to develop dedicated pages for each area where your business operates. These pages speak directly to the people you want to serve and contain local touches that resonate with them.

* **Location-Specific Landing Pages:** Each page should mention the location, local offerings, and any special details unique to that area.
* **Metadata Optimized for Local Queries:** Use descriptive titles and meta descriptions that include location names and phrases that local users might search.
* **Schema Markup:** This extra bit of code helps search systems understand your business details better. It may include elements like your address, business type, and operating hours.

Crafting a clear layout that search engines and users can navigate smoothly is key. Having local landing pages means that someone searching for your services in a particular part of town immediately finds relevant information. Such pages often include a phone number, a map, directions, and information about local events or promotions. The content on these pages should feel personal and welcoming.

Optimizing your metadata is another chance to emphasize your local identity. Craft titles and descriptions that appeal to local audiences. Ensure these snippets of text represent your business accurately. When users see your details on a search result page, they should immediately recognize a connection to their area.

Code enhancements such as schema markup add extra depth to your pages. By tagging elements like your business address or operating hours, search systems pick up signals about your location without extra effort. This practice smooths the communication between your site and search algorithms, making it easier to rank for local queries. With clear, accurate data onboard, each page gains an extra layer of compatibility with the systems that deliver local results.

A well-structured and organized website is the backbone of local optimization. Ensuring that visitors, whether new or returning, can easily move through your site builds confidence. When users are not lost in a maze of links, they’re more inclined to explore further. Quantities such as clear navigation menus, prominently displayed contact details, and location maps all go a long way in building trust.

**Content Strategies for Local Engagement**

Content that connects with local readers should address topics that speak directly about life in your area. Regular posts that focus on community happenings, local guides, or neighborhood events can make your website a valuable resource for locals. Stories and updates that relate to your community keep visitors returning.

* **Hyperlocal Content:** Create articles or blog posts that explore the culture and current happenings in your area. This might include food festivals, charity events, or local sports matches.
* **Local Features:** Share news about partnerships with nearby businesses or profiles of local residents. Tailor content that highlights how your business fits in with the local scene.
* **Customer Spotlights:** Feature testimonials and experiences from local customers who have enjoyed your services. Genuine accounts build credibility and a sense of community.

Producing regular local content gives your audience a reason to visit your website over and over again. News about local events, community initiatives, or how a new neighborhood project is developing keeps the conversation active. This content is not just news—it creates a narrative that feels relevant and trustworthy. Sharing updates about weekend activities or local trends draws in readers who are always looking for insights about their community.

Creating a conversation around your area also invites engagement. Ask local readers for their opinions on recent events or local issues. Hosting small contests or surveys involving community topics can stir up interest and participation. The content you maintain on your website can serve as a hub for these discussions, offering space to leave comments or read reviews.

Another effective way to engage is to incorporate visual elements like photos of local events, maps of the neighborhood, or even short video clips of community activities. Visual media often tells a story more instantly than written content. When users see genuine photos of local landmarks or events, they connect more deeply with the narrative. This style makes your website a dynamic part of the local scene.

Interviewing local personalities or writing profiles about community heroes gives your content a personal touch. These features not only highlight the human side of your business but also extend a hand to the community. In many cases, readers follow these narratives because they reflect their own experiences or aspirations in the local setting. By including diverse local voices, your website becomes a platform that values perspective and authenticity.

**The Role of Reviews and Reputation Management**

Online reviews are central to building credibility among local audiences. A steady stream of genuine customer feedback not only boosts your online profile but also tells new customers that your business has a reliable track record. This patrol of public opinion influences search systems and builds confidence among potential consumers.

* **Encourage Reviews:** Invite customers to share their experiences on your profile pages or review websites. A simple request after a service visit or retail purchase often yields positive responses.
* **Monitor Reviews:** Keep a regular check on what people say. This vigilance helps you address concerns quickly and celebrate positive experiences.
* **Respond to Feedback:** Acknowledge positive reviews with a sincere thank you and deal with negative reviews with understanding and care. A well-crafted response shows that you value feedback.

When customers share how they feel about your business, it sends strong signals to search engines and prospective clients alike. Gathering consistent feedback builds trust and paints a picture of a business that is active within its community. Reviews provide necessary social proof, making your online profile more attractive during local searches. Many people trust opinions from fellow community members over generic advertising claims.

Reputation management goes hand in hand with responding to reviews. It is important to show that every piece of feedback is taken seriously. When addressing negative comments, offer clear solutions that demonstrate your commitment to resolving any issues. A personalized note addressing a customer’s concern can turn a critical review into an opportunity for positive growth.

Keep in mind that quality reviews matter more than quantity. Focus on earning thoughtful remarks that detail experiences. Customers who take the time to write reviews contribute more meaning and build a foundation of trust. Transparency in feedback inspires new customers to explore your services. Without a doubt, an active and engaging review section helps potential buyers in their decision process.

**Citations and Local Link Building**

Citations are listings that mention your business on external platforms. They are a way for search systems to confirm your details by checking reputable directories. Local citations usually appear on real-world platforms like local business directories, community pages, or industry-specific sites. These citations build a sense of legitimacy and add multiple touchpoints that represent your locality online.

* **Build Citations:** Register your business on popular local directories and verify that your details are accurate. Look for directories that influence local search visibility.
* **Collaborate Locally:** Create opportunities to mention your business on local blogs, event pages, or community websites. Such efforts foster connections and generate quality online mentions.
* **Community Initiatives:** Participate in local events or sponsor community programs to earn mentions and backlinks. This type of online reference establishes your business as an active local participant.

One advantage of a strong local link profile is that it expands your business footprint across the web. When respected local organizations reference your work, search systems gather extra evidence that your business plays a role in the community. In practice, every citation acts as a mini endorsement. Directories that list your business, when accurate, raise your trust factor among local audience members.

Building links locally is a process that thrives on genuine interactions. Begin by identifying complementary businesses in your area. For instance, partnering with a nearby charity event or community fundraiser provides an opportunity for both promotion and sincere engagement. These local collaborations offer natural ways to share your story while establishing your online reputation.

Local link building is not only about accumulating citations. It includes communicating with local media channels. If a local newspaper or radio station writes about your business, it opens channels that can bring more visitors to your site. Such local recognition extends beyond digital entries and emphasizes your role as a contributing member of the community. This approach builds trust and positions your business as both competent and reachable.

**Mobile Optimization and Voice Search**

In recent years, the number of mobile users has grown steadily. Mobile users search for local businesses on phones and tablets, and search systems are built to accommodate these queries. Ensuring that your website displays well on small screens is critical to retaining visitors and encouraging them to engage with your services.

* **Mobile-Friendly Design:** Ensure that your website layout adapts smoothly to various screen sizes. This includes clear menus, legible text, and fast load times on mobile networks.
* **Voice Search Readiness:** People often search using natural language when speaking. Prepare your content for queries that sound like everyday conversation.
* **Fast Performance:** Streamline your site to load quickly across devices. Fast performance enhances user satisfaction and improves the chance that potential customers will stay on your site.

Mobile usage has reshaped local search. When someone is on the move, the need for a quick answer translates into a concise search query. By ensuring that your site not only looks great on a smartphone but also loads quickly, you hold your audience’s attention. A mobile-friendly website helps users navigate and quickly find local information. Simple design choices—like a clear call-to-action button or a floating contact link—help mobile visitors reach out instantly.

Voice search is another growing trend that changes the way people seek information. Users speak to their devices in a tone that is relaxed and natural. Preparing your content for voice queries means using questions and phrases that people actually say rather than static keywords. For instance, listing your operating hours with clear, conversational phrasing makes it easier for a smart device to pick up your information.

Focusing on mobile optimization means checking your website’s speed and responsiveness regularly. It pays to test the site on various devices, ensuring that pages render properly regardless of screen size or operating system. A fast, responsive site encourages users to explore your business and reach out for more details. The effort put into smoothing the mobile experience often helps increase customer interactions and builds trust among potential local clients.

**Tracking and Measuring Local SEO Success**

Knowing how well your local SEO efforts are performing requires regular checks and measurements. Tracking the right metrics makes it easier to fine-tune your approach and see what works. There are many tools available that simplify the process and provide statistics on local search performance.

* **Ranking Tools:** Use reliable systems that monitor your standing in local search results. These tools help to check how often your website appears in searches with local hints.
* **Traffic Analytics:** Look into the number of visitors coming from your local pages and see how they interact with your website. This data assists in understanding page performance and user behavior.
* **User Action Metrics:** Keep track of phone call requests, map clicks, and direction requests. These insights reflect how local users engage with your business profile.

Regular monitoring of local metrics gives you a clear idea of which changes have a positive impact. When you check your website data frequently, you can spot trends that indicate an increase or a drop in local interest. This monitoring supports continuous improvement. Adjust small details, such as meta descriptions or call-to-action placements, based on the behavior patterns you observe. Refining your approach gradually builds a strong local presence over time.

The data gathered not only shows whether the techniques are successful but also highlights areas that need attention. Tools that track user direction requests or map clicks provide strong evidence about the local reach of your profile. This quantitative insight helps in assessing the return on the time spent on local SEO. With consistent analysis, you maintain a proactive stance in refining your online presence.

Tracking performance also means regularly reviewing your online business profiles. Ensure that customer feedback is integrated into your overall strategy. Collecting and analyzing this information helps shape future content as well as technical adjustments on your website. The more you know about user interactions, the easier it is to craft deep connections with local visitors.

**Challenges in Local SEO**

Every strategy faces hurdles. Local SEO, too, comes with its set of obstacles that businesses must navigate. The digital arena is often crowded, and standing out among local competitors is a challenge many face. Dealing with misrepresented information online or spam entries is just one of many challenges.

* **High Competition:** Many businesses in one area might be targeting similar local keywords. Increase your focus on making your unique local voice heard.
* **Fake Feedback:** Managing undesirable reviews can be tricky. Take care to address criticism calmly and offer potential fixes if a customer’s experience wasn’t as expected.
* **Fluctuating Systems:** Updates to search systems can cause brief shifts in local rankings. Staying informed and flexible in your approach helps in managing these changes.

As a business owner, you learn that some aspects of local SEO require constant vigilance. Competitive local markets mean that every detail counts—from the exact phrasing in your online business listings to the way you manage online feedback. An ongoing review of your data and a consistent approach strengthen your standing.

Dealing with problems online means taking a proactive stance. If you spot misrepresented information or unverified reviews, it is best to address these issues quickly. Offer solutions in a polite manner that focuses on resolving differences. A well-managed reputation and an active online profile seldom suffer for too long when these issues are handled promptly.

Algorithm changes by search systems can also affect local performance. When such changes happen, it is wise to review your entire profile and determine what might need refinement. Adjustments in content, link building, or user engagement might be necessary to keep pace with updates. Keeping an open line of communication with community members can also offer fresh insights that guide your modifications.

While local SEO has its fair share of challenges, each obstacle presents an opportunity for you to refine your strategy. The more you work on maintaining consistent, genuine details online, the more likely you will build an online profile that resonates with local audiences. Patience and steady effort often help smooth issues that seem disruptive at first glance.

**Actionable Steps for Businesses**

For those ready to implement these techniques, here’s a hands-on list of actions to start working on your local online presence:

1. **Claim and Verify Your Business Listing:**
   * Visit a major business directory and complete your profile.
   * Confirm that your address, contact details, and hours are correct.
2. **Ensure NAP Consistency:**
   * Review your online entries on major sites.
   * Use a spreadsheet to track details and check for uniformity.
3. **Optimize Your Website Pages:**
   * Create landing pages for each area you serve.
   * Update page titles, meta tags, and content with local identifiers.
4. **Enhance Customer Engagement:**
   * Request reviews from top customers after service.
   * Monitor online feedback and reply courteously to every review.
5. **Build Local Citations and Collaborations:**
   * Register with local business directories.
   * Partner with community organizations for event sponsorships or collaborations.
6. **Test Mobile and Voice Capabilities:**
   * Check your website’s performance on various devices.
   * Adjust your content to include everyday phrases and queries common in spoken search.
7. **Track Your Progress:**
   * Use website analytics to monitor clicks and mapping requests.
   * Periodically check keyword ranking tools for local performance insights.

Following these steps puts you on a clear path to enhance your local recognition. Make your adjustments one at a time, and then measure the outcome before adding the next improvement. Taking time to refine each element ensures that nothing is rushed and that your foundation remains solid.

If you need a quick checklist, here is a summary:

* Verify and update your online profiles.
* Publish location-specific pages.
* Encourage and manage user feedback.
* Create natural links through community efforts.
* Test your site on mobile devices for smooth performance.
* Regularly review key performance data.

Using these actionable tasks, you can steadily improve your local profile. Regular effort pays off when local customers start to associate your business with quality service and community engagement.

**Closing Thoughts**

Geo-based search optimization is a valuable tool to help your business connect with local audiences. Taking the time to enhance your online profile, encourage meaningful customer feedback, and craft dedicated content for your community can transform the way local clients find you. The practices outlined above are practical, clear, and designed to keep your company aligned with the needs of your nearby market.

I'm posting it online for free to help you all with studying!

That being said, if my study guide helped you survive (or even mildly tolerate) exam prep, consider tossing a few bucks my way (PayPal link below). I poured a lot of coffee, time, and probably some sanity into making this, so your support = much appreciated and will help contribute to my rampant caffeine dependence as I complete my PGY-3 EM year.

Either way, good luck on the exam — and may the odds be ever in your favour.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/ogCNVId)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you’ve watched recently?

I just took a shower, I washed my hair, brushed my teeth, put on an airy white night dress, and I am all tucked in, snug as a bug.

My face is breaking out a bit, my period is late. I've been bad with my medication again, silly me. I thought I could exercise the sickie away. That's not how it works.

Today was a horny day for me, so I worked out a lot. I was having sex flashbacks from times with Mirror Man, that made me physically pause to take a breath and steady myself. It was rough.

I've been having mini cramps, that make me hold my stomach and make a face, and last a few seconds.

That's okay though, it doesn't hurt too much or too long.

My feet are cold, but I'm comfy under my sheet. I'm dozing off Diary. I'm such a good girl. I switched my nightly coffee to a cup of hot milk.

I am lactose intolerant, so I have to mix one part milk with 3 parts water. Hot milk is so yummy and it makes me feel small and sleepy.

Thank you for keeping me company while I go through my eleventy thousandth and fifty nine hundredth break up in this life time.

Sorry for the long post, I'll try to keep this short, so please let me know if I should elaborate.
This guy is SUPER sweet and I've been crushing on him for a little while, he does seem more introverted or shy, and possibly inexperienced (?). So I've been trying to handle the situation with kid gloves out of respect.  I hope that context helps as I have really never been the pursuer, but I keep seeing that men are wishing more women would ask them out so I said fuck it, I'm going to try and see what happens. 

I (F) asked him out on a date. I fumbled the first time when I tried in-person (check post history for that), and a week later I handed him a note. 

That night, he sent me an extremely kind text explaining that he needed time to process + put his thoughts into words, which I thought was very reasonable and I respect that, as I myself tend to need space to process.

When he got back to me, he said (in short), ""I'm not really looking for a relationship right now, but part of me does want to go on a date once."" He was also again, very kind and compliment-y in his text. He asked if that's something I'd be interested in (going on a date despite his honesty) and I said something along the lines of, ""I'd be happy with that, but no pressure! I don't have any expectations [for a relationship].""

I also thanked him for being considerate of my feelings and gentle, but I also reiterated that it was totally cool if he said no, I wouldn't be offended and I'd be happy being friends anyways. I offered him another possible ""exit"" point and he said something like, ""I'm not sure how I can convince you, but I want to do this, for me.""

I told him I trusted him then, and I suggested: either a walk OR getting coffee. I figured either one of these would be low-pressure, and maybe less scary, but what does he hit me back with?... ""Let's go big or go home. How about coffee, a walk, and then dinner?""

I was really surprised at this, but agreed to it. I just thought if he seemed uncertain before, maybe not really into it, why make the plan BIGGER? 

Part of me was concerned at first, that he might be doing this out of politeness, however...
* I had offered him 3 separate ""outs"" if he wanted to not do it at all. 
* He could have just said ""no"" at first instead of needing time to think?
* He suggested spending /more/ time together than what I had initially offered/expected.

So, I'm a little confused here! We really don't know eachother that well, and in my confession I only said I'd like to get to know him better. We interact well, we joke around, we make eachother laugh. Truthfully, I thought we were flirting for at least a month or two - but I guess I misinterpreted the situation and I do feel bad for taking his kindness as anything more. :( Now I know all the men I've done this too unintentionally (being kind to them, but they thought I was flirting...)

If anybody's got some insight, preferably if you are a man in a similar sort of personality type, would really like some of your perspectives so I maaaaay be able to get some idea of what's going through his head... Because I really don't know. 

I'm not expecting a second date after this, as I do trust that he's not looking for anything / not interested in me, so once that realization set in, my heart has been detaching slowly from the situation. I'm trying to do my best to see this as ""friends hanging out"" and nothing more.

Before starting the story I know I am mostly in the wrong here;

I became a co-owner of a friends coffee place 2 years ago. Small cash down and sweat equity for the rest with an end of accrual of sweat equity in three years. Agreed final % at the end. 

Anyways, his place was losing a lot of money because of poor choices in GM’s. It was a good opportunity for me because I knew what needed to be fixed etc. Anyways, there was a worker already there that I thought could be a good GM but needed work. I had been laid off from my full time job at the time and took the offer. I personally decided she should be the GM going forward and I’d train her and build her up over time into the role. She agreed and so the work began. 

We started building up a good friendship during this. My partner lives far away so is not around, leaving me to the day to day while I train her. There was some sexual tension between us but I knew, that never ends well and I also was in a long term relationship with a girl I wanted to marry. So I did not do anything. Obviously enjoyed the attraction though (who doesn’t like feeling attracted by another). 

A couple months in, my grandma went into hospice. She died not long after. 2 days later my mom died suddenly and unexpectedly. We weren’t super close but it was my mom nonetheless. The day my grandma died my long term of many years girlfriend broke up with me. We were having issues. Some mine - some hers. I should have seen the signs, but, love makes us blind. She left and moved out. 

Three significant losses in a matter of three days. I always considered myself strong and have been through a lot but this broke me. Being honest here, since no one will know me, I was more pained and hurt by my ex than I was by the deaths. I love both members of my family but this was what I thought the love of my life. So in a nutshell THAT breakup (the one that changes everything). Side note: I understand why some say a breakup can be worst than the death of someone close. I know this very well now. 

During this time I got hired to go back to full time work while I also was still over seeing the new GM and operations at the coffee place. To give context to my mental anguish through the next 4-5 months (it’s important) I lost my full time new job because I couldn’t work. I was a sad excuse for a guy in the fetile position everyday. Mostly due to my ex leaving and feeling the impact of my mom. 

So while in the anguished state of not being able to work and not showering etc etc my GM and me got closer, she had been through something like this before and was trying to help me through. One thing leads to another and we are now being physical, with me lying and being deceitful that I was over my ex (I thought protruding outwards would make it real on the inside). I hadn’t been through this type of breakup yet. I didn’t understand rebounds and all of that etc. 

I still lied tho and over the next 4-5 months I slowly realized what I had done and the hurt that I had caused her (she figured out I wasn’t really over my ex). Let alone the imbalance of power at the coffee shop I put her in. Wrong, wrong, wrong.

I didn’t want my partner to know (I take great pride in my reputation) so we agreed to move back to being friends and trying to separate the shop from personal. As I’m sure you guessed, that didn’t work out well over time. It took a year of sometimes fighting because she was still hurt and wanted a real relationship with me and I essentially had strung her along and wasn’t ready (Don’t do this to someone, I wish I understood where I was emotionally/mentally, it’s a horrible thing to do to another). I apologized profusely for this, many times. I was wrong and hurt her. 

As decisions had to be made over the next year at the shop, if I didn’t make the decisions she wanted she would take it personally because of the relationship we had. I failed at trying to solve that problem and the arguments kept boiling up until 2 weeks ago, when we got into another yelling match. She got off the phone with me and called my partner and told him everything. 

Now he is upset (rightfully so) that I hid this from him. I accept that. He would like to make it work with the three of us. 

While I was wrong and very much so at the beginning I also feel betrayed by her. There could have been a better way to resolve the issue. Like going to my partner together and working through it. Versus her going to him in hysteria.

I don’t know if I have the right to feel betrayed but I do. I did do a lot for her as well. I didn’t want to minimize the harm I have caused her and prop myself up by listing all of it earlier. But, I did try and make it right and do a lot for her professionally and personally through the year of fighting before she disclosed everything to my business partner.

He wants us three to get on a call and flush this out. Which right now I’m still very angry and feel betrayed by her and have told him I am pondering leaving the business entirely. I have to make a decision by the end of the week. I am struggling to want to speak with her because I feel betrayed but I do accept and understand I betrayed her first. 

Am I a horrible person? I made a mistake, yet I have a hard time forgiving her when I’m mostly in the wrong every which way to Sunday. 

Some will probably say pride or got caught with your hand in the cookie jar. 

Maybe that’s true. Iv learned a lot from this whole ordeal. Accept the accountability and will do much better in the future (I do not date anyone as I know I’m still not ready and never want to put someone through that anguish again). 

Am I wrong for feeling betrayed by her for telling our secret to my business partner the way she did?

“Yeah. Of course.” I said placatingly.

I know it takes time to take full effect but I'm having some concerns. I was originally prescribed 10mg at night but was getting crazy brain and body zaps Wich is not my chief complaint. Doc told me to split the dose 5 in the am 5 in the pm. However every time I take this medication within 30-45 minutes my heart is just pounding out of my chest. Heart rate is hitting the 160s then back down to the 80s-90s and this will continue for a good 4 hours of up and down before my heart rate stabilizes and goes back down to a normal 60-70. I know for a fact this is caused by the medication and I don't think it's normal. I expressed my concerns to my psychiatrist and she just didn't seem concerned at all and said to just continue the medication and stop paying attention to my heart rate. What's odd here is a high heart rate is one of my big trigger's for a panic attack and thankfully that hasn't happened due to this. Only because I believe the Klonopin is mitigating the effects of the Busoirone. Tbh I don't see myself staying with this medication. So my questions are has anyone else had this experience taking Buspirone? Also what is a medication that you've taken or are currently taking or may know of that has helped with yours or anyones  anxiety and panic attacks that is a non benzo? I'm looking for something that is highly effective with minimal side effects, no weight gain, no effects on norepinephrine or noreadrenaline. Something that will not increase my heart rate.

One other time, he invited me for a group trip rather than his girlfriend, and when I couldn’t join, he invited her and she was quite irritated by the fact that she was his second option (who wouldn’t).

For all this time, he always gave me some hints, but it was always subtle. I reciprocated. One time, we started talking and he invited me for a coffee, and it felt like we never stopped the contact. He’s the person I can not see for 2 years, but when we meet, it’s like nothing has changed. We were out for 8-9 hours and it flew like a minute. But when I got home he didn’t text me. And I was so mad, because I feel like both of us wanted to be together, but nobody was ever too brave to make a first, real step, instead of just hinting. At the same time, my long-time friend was very open with me and showed me that he wanted something with me. That friend was very intentional, clear, there was no questions, and he was a great guy overall. I was so frustrated that my ex is not being as direct and clear as him, and I tried to get over him once and for all, so I decided to give a nice guy a chance even though I wasn’t attracted to him. Impulsive decision and a big mistake, broke up very soon, and nothing good came out of that, exactly the opposite.

For a context, I am a girl who extremely rarely gets into a relationship, and the reason is because I can’t get attracted by literally anybody but my ex. Even when I feel physical attraction to somebody, I can’t get a mental connection. I think I made a mistake for not being braver and clarify this with my ex when we were in a talking stage, but I didn’t. I decided to leave the only chance to be with him, and I am aware how stupid that was of me.

The worst thing is that I really feel that two of us were supposed to end up together, but both of us were cowards (the funny thing is, I can be extremely open and flirty with other guys, but I would never do anything more than a subtle hint when it comes to him). I feel like he was always the one sincerely supporting me (along my family), and I feel like he is my person, it doesn’t matter if we are in contact or not.

But I think he gave up once I moved to another country (which makes sense), and we stopped all the hints and contact. However, I feel like that even made it more difficult to get over him. I even dreamed the other night that he proposed to his current girlfriend, and I cried for 2 hours. Maybe I even gave up getting over him and just accepted that he’ll always be the one I will always long for. But that means that I will never have a happy and fulfilled love life again, and I can’t accept with it. And it’s not even fair to our partners. But I think it’s way too late to talk about it now because I moved and we lost all touch. So I really don’t know how will I ever overcome this. 8 years passed, I tried absolutely everything, and nothing worked.

Sometimes I think “if he wanted he would” but then I remember that I wanted and I didn’t. But on the other hand, the fact that I’m still not over him even though 8 years passed makes me wonder if there’s a reason for that? That ‘he’s the one’. And the fact that we continually had something going on through all that time (I have a gut feeling that we always expected to end up together) even though everybody would get tired and just give up? Finally, is it just okay if you never get over some people? Is it okay to accept that you’ll never fully love again, knowing that the person you love is with somebody else?

And yes, once again, I’m ashamed to admit all of this, even to myself. It’s just that I lost hope that I will ever get over him, because if it was possible, I would do it 1000x in this time.",1,1744923091.0,relationships_advice,0,1.0,False

First, I used 14g per the basket's nominal spec. There was a ton of headspace, and shot was sour, watery, and something like 40g in 19"".

Then, I went with 16g and ground finer (approx. 0.8 with Eureka Specialita). The tamped coffee ended up just below the recessed ring so still a bit of extra headspace. The result was better but still sour and still far from the target 1:2 or 1:2.5 ratio in 25-30"".

Now, I'm focusing on 17g+ and grinding at 0.5 which brings the tamped coffee into the recessed ring. I get something like 1:2.5 in 25"" but still predominently sour. I've noticed 1 or 2 small small holes on the top of the dried puck but its underside is unbroken so I'm not sure if that's 'counts' as channeling. 

Don't get me wrong, I really want to trust Profitec when they call the basket 14g but the way I see it, to get 14g of tamped coffee to sufficiently fill that basket, it would have to be ground so coarse that it would offer minimal resistance. I do plan on getting a naked portafilter but I was hoping to keep the baskets since they are of good construction and I actually do prefer smaller doses.

So I started this new job kinda recently. I'm a 1099 contractor working in remote sales. My job involves calling leads, pitching them, and booking appointments for demos in hopes of making a sale. Since I’m 1099, my paycheck depends entirely on how much I actually do my job correctly.

The problem is I have no schedule. I can start whenever I want, take random days off, or work weekends. It's total freedom, which sounds great, but it might be part of my issue.

In my previous remote jobs, I had accountability. Managers would track how I spent my time, and that external pressure kept me on task. My current job doesn’t have any of that. It’s just, “Here are your leads, call them when you want, and I’ll see you in meetings.”

I need to hit around 50 calls a day, which isn’t crazy—it’s usually a quick call, an email, and scheduling the next one. But I struggle with starting my work and staying focused. It's almost a chore to make myself want to willingly walk into my office, open my system, and actually dial someone. There's days where I'm lucky to hit a dozen calls. I’ll sit down at my desk, start working, and 45 minutes later, I’m playing on my phone (which I need for work so I can't put it away), playing with my dog, getting more coffee, taking a snack break, whatever gets me away from my work. Also side note I even have a minimalist launcher on my phone to avoid distractions 

I’ve tried the 25-minute work/5-minute break timer method, and while it helps a bit, I still find myself losing focus. I've tried making it a game to race myself to get calls in a time window or more calls within a certain time, but that hasn't stuck. I’ve also been using Flow Tunes (a free site with background music and timers), which helps a little too, but I can’t seem to stick with anything consistently. I'm even trying gameify apps like habitica to make the whole ""get x calls done"" fun, but it's not helping. 

Does anyone have tips for kicking yourself into gear and staying on task in a totally unscheduled environment? I’d love to hear what’s worked for you guys. ",1,1744922892.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

You know the ""zing"" they talk about? Yea... that. It was so odd because she said the same thing too. She would sneak looks and I would do the same back etc etc. We spoke and got to know each other over the next few days and I still remember what she was wearing, how she looked etc. Out of no where, they left the camp early and i didnt see her after. I kept thinking about her everyday Following year I meet these 2 brothers and we would play basketball and soccer together and we became close. I go to their house and they introduced me to their sister, and it was her. We instantly saw each other and remembered. She said she had been thinking the same etc etc. We exchanged ""MSN messengers"" and ""ICQ"" lol and we kept in touch. We wouldn't meet face to face because our families were both very strict and it was against our religion.

I was/am crazy about this girl. I feel something in my chest whenever I hear her name, I start sweating when she's being talked about around me. Until this day.

My last yr in high school (1999?) I switched schools to be in her best friends school so she can come visit under the disguise that she's visiting her friend but we would link up. We were inseparable. I was crazy about her and she was head over heels about me. We both skipped out on Uni and went to community College so we can be closer together. We were together everyday. One day, I said fuck it - I've been crazy about this girl for a few years, I am going to propose. In my culture, I tell my mom and she goes and speaks to her mom then the father gets the final say (that's how it was before  it's changed now).

At that time, there was some issues happening in our small community. Unfortunately, my dad and her dad were opposite each other in those ""issues"". My mom speaks to her mom and her mom was so happy. She said he's the perfect guy, good head on his shoulders, smart, etc etc... I told my gf at the time that her mom said all that and she said yes she told me the same thing and we're all so happy. Out of nowhere my mom comes up to me and said her father decided against it. After a few talks here and there and her mother pleading with the father etc, he stuck to his guns and said it's not good for her. I was devastated.... heart broken.

Bad thing is I had friends that told me it's not her father that was saying all this, but it was actually her. That she thought I wasn't good enough for her, she can do better etc etc. I think it was mostly anger towards the family for saying no to me but I went up to her and told her that I never loved her, it was just a bs relationship and that I don't want to see her anymore. This was summer of 2001 I believe. Now I was still insanely in love with her, would always ask her friends about her, and drive around her neighborhood hoping she would come out so I can see her. Unfortunately, never saw her for years after that.

I then hear she got married in 04? Around same time I had an arranged married and got married. I kept checking out her social medias, or wherever I can find her online. She eventually ended up having 2 kids but got divorced. I sent her a msg randomly out of the blue on a social media profile that I know of hers saying sorry to hear that etc etc. She replied saying thank you and that was that.

Fast forward to 3.5 years ago... crazy part is our boys are the same age and they know each other well (maybe even friends? Idk). I made a burner account on Instagram and messaged her. We kept talking about the most random things for 6 months or so. I was under the impression she didn't know it was me and just having friendly conversation. 6 months of online talking I told her hey btw it's me.... and I told her everything, all my secrets etc and she replied with Yeah I knew the whole time. I asked her if she wanted to go for coffee and she agreed. We met up and kept meeting up next few weeks daily. But I always felt bad because my wife is amazing and didn't want to do that to her. That was the first time we've actually spoken since 2001, over 20+ years past.

I told her I told you it was done because your father declined my proposal & because I hear it was you that said no. She told me there hasn't been a day she hadn't thought about me and she was still in love with me after all those years and a marriage/divorce. She said she used to drive by my house and hope to see me leaving my house. Same shit I did before. I told her what I said was all bs about nor loving her and I am still madly in love with her and still think about her all the time.

Anyways this was a much bigger post than I had anticipated and I probably missed out on alot of things but just wanted to get things off my chest.

I still creep her socials and pretty sure she does the same. If you're reading this, I love you. 25 years ago, now and always ❤️. ",3,1744922883.0,offmychest,1,0.8,False

Apologies if this isn't the recomennded way to post it. I just found this to be most helpful personally.


.

.

.


Couple notes:

- This is basically the entire month of May 2025

- The first two weeks are with others and blacked out because nothing can really change there. Will NOT be working at all.

- The remaining time is solo travel and I will be working around 5-8 evenings for about 3-6 hours or so

- As such, I am doing most of my longer bus/train commutes around 3pm and after so I can work on it (unless its a weekend)

- I'd like to shorten the trip to about 30 days but have NO IDEA what to cut

- My main focus is walking around, taking in the scenery, seeing historical sites (**churches, architecture, historical sites, coastlines, coffee shops).

- I am trying not to be GO GO GO since I am also working, but still want to get a good feel for these cities. 

- Blank cells are unplanned/free days as of now

- Many cells may *look* packed but I don't think are too crazy since a lot of these are just squares you walk by or sites you pop into for an hour or so.

- I end in Rome as I fly out of there but could possibly change it 

- I plan to (have to!) live pretty cheaply so will be staying in hostels and hopefully spending <75-100 USD per day


.

.

.




The **cities I'm NOT certain on yet:** 

- Bologna (bc not sure enough time)

- Brescia (only considering because of a penpal there - will probably try to meet them in Verona instead if they agree)

- Trieste (seems like a great city tho I'll have to stop in if I go to Slovenia anyway)

- Siena/San Gimignano (worried if I have enough time anyway


.

.

.



Possible changes/additions:

- I'm also wondering if I should go from Venice -> Bled for one night. Then Ljubljana for 2 nights. From there, I may take a tour guide group that takes you from Ljubljana to Postojna Caves/Predjama/Piran and stay there ideally (or goes back to Ljubljana)

- For Piran, there are some day tours to nearby places as well that may help me see more inland cities without needing a car

- Similarly for Siena/San Gimignano, there are some day tours from Florence, so I may stay in Florence on Day 30 instead

- Considering cutting Rome entirely and saving for another trip, though I have never been before and it almost seems criminal


.

.

.


Questions:

- Any feedback? 

- Should I cut any of these cities? Currently this is a 5 week trip but I'd like to cut about 5 days or so. Again, I am ONLY working around 8 evenings max, but hope to do so on several of the commutes.

I'm just a kitchen bunny! I'm supposed to make soups and coffee and be happy! But it feels like we're already settling into taking shifts just to cope with the stress.

I've been on MTF HRT for 3 and a half months. I heard you get more ""full body"" type of arousal, so I think that's what this is? I think this probably happened a few times already, but this is definitely noticeable. I was making coffee and then out of nowhere, I started feeling very uncontrollably ""aroused"" for no reason lol. (I think?)

 It's a very odd but fun sensation. I started feeling warm all over, a little bit of tiny shaking, and I feel like I just got flooded with full body arousal. It's a bit maddening, and I feel like I'm going ga ga! It's like if ahegao face was an emotion lol. I wanted to scream, but I just yelled a bit lol. I started grabbing my chest and I've nearly cookie crumbled to my knees a few times. 🍪😵‍💫💖

It reminded me of my ex-gf, who would like shake sometimes during schmex. I always loved that, super cute. But yeah, that's exactly what this reminded me of, thus the quivers. Obviously no schmex, I was literally just going about my business!

You all have felt something like this? Right?? This is normal on HRT right? Or am I just going crazy? How of do y'all quiver?

I’m not here to stroke your spiritual ego like it’s a purring godcat on a velvet pillow.
I don’t care what your guides whispered to you between kombucha sips.

Just delete the post if it's bunk. 🙃
It shows respect.
It shows you’re still growing.
Hell, I’d trust a mystic who admits they were wrong more than one who’s just levitating on a cloud of their own smugness. ☁️🛸

People dangling metaphors like shiny bait on a golden hook…

Change them.

Just make sure it’s you calling the shots.
Not your trauma.
Not your trendiness.
You.

Put your soul at risk.

And when it stings—
When you see the thing you’ve been avoiding in the mirror, with clown shoes and old guilt…

Overcome it.
Rip the mask off.
Step into the storm with nothing but your name and your nerve.

Maybe it’s “money.”
Maybe it’s your relationship that died seven months ago and still haunts your playlists.
Maybe you signed up for the Responsibility Olympics because you thought self-sacrifice was noble.

Well, guess what?

That path ends in three ways:
☠️ Death
⛈️ Ruin
🎭 Tragedy

Break out of your vices.
Break into virtue.
No, not the cotton-candy churchy kind.

The kind where your spine clicks into place and your mind, body, and soul finally stop arguing. 🧘‍♂️⚔️

✨ Solidarity of self.
✨ No doubt.
✨ Just focus.

Laser.
Sharp.
Awake.

Because at the end of the void—

YOU ARE AUTHORITY.
You are the one behind the curtain, pressing the buttons and pretending you didn’t. 🎛️

And please…
Stop standing behind your beliefs.
They’re not a shield.
They’re not a tent.
They’re not a Facebook bio.

They’re just cardboard cutouts of who you used to be.
You’re not safer hiding behind them.
You’re just stuck.

🔥 Stand in front of your beliefs.

Let ‘em follow you like dogs.
Let ‘em burn down if they get too old.
Let ‘em evolve like Pokémon in a volcano.

Get out of your shade.
Step into the sun.
Into the heat.
Into the noise.
Into the symphony. 🎶☀️

Get ahead of your beliefs.
Turn around. Look at ‘em.

You’ve outgrown those spiritual training wheels.
You actually get to be an explorer now.

Not a prophet.
Not a preacher.
Not a parrot.

An EXPLORER. 🧭🌀💫
You. Wild and weird and walking barefoot across the edge of your own unknown.

Doesn’t that sound fun?

(wink 😜 
🥕 drops carrot. disappears into a puff of glittering ego death)

Okay, buckle up buttercups, because I've got thoughts. I finally caved and picked up this Mystery Man Solid Cologne, and let me tell you, the hype might actually be real. For someone like me who's always on the go, lugging around a glass bottle of cologne just felt… precarious. Enter this little tin of magic.

First off, the scent. They call it ""Mystery Man,"" and honestly, it kind of lives up to the name. It's got this intriguing blend – a little bit woodsy, a touch spicy, and definitely something that makes you go ""hmm, what is that?"" in a good way. It's not overpowering, which I appreciate. Nobody wants to be that guy who walks into the coffee shop and announces his presence with a wall of fragrance. This is more subtle, more… come closer and find out. 😉

The application is a breeze. Just a little swipe with your finger and dab it on your pulse points – wrists, neck, even behind the ears. It melts right into your skin and lasts a decent amount of time. I put it on before heading out for a walk along the river this morning, and I could still catch whiffs of it a few hours later. That's a win in my book!

The tin itself is pretty slick too. Small enough to toss in my pocket or my backpack without taking up much space. Plus, no worries about it shattering if I accidentally drop it. Major bonus points for practicality!

Honestly, I was a little skeptical about solid cologne at first. I thought it might feel waxy or not have much staying power. But this Mystery Man stuff has definitely changed my mind. It's convenient, smells fantastic, and the scent is just the right level of captivating.

If you're looking for a new way to smell good without the fuss, I'd definitely recommend giving this a try. It's become my new everyday go-to!

1k1n5f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/antivirus/comments/1k1n5f2/lumnac_and_leonem_trojan_through_tg/,LumnaC and Leonem Trojan through TG,"Hi, I think I got infected with a Trojan, and I wanted to ask you for advice. I don't like to create topics, but I think that, as it has been a long time since I got a virus it is better to just ask you guys for knowledge on what to do.

* How it happened:

So some weeks ago I started using Telegram which I have been reticent about. I had been happy using it and after some time I noticed that the default setting of Telegram is to download files and photos smaller than <8mb automatically, so I turned it off and then kept using it. No one wants to download anything ugly by mistake, and I always thought that the best antivirus is to use common sense and not download weird stuff.

So, anyway this morning I was shuffling through some telegram chats, when I suddenly get added to a new group or channel or whatever.

Turns out, that from the start Telegram has ""everyone (not just contacts) can add you to groups"" turned on in the settings by default. Which I didn't know about.

So, I am with my morning coffee and I see a new group and I am like, hu? Click on it. Scroll like a tiny little bit up to see what it was all aobut and some files started to get downloaded automatically.

I go like, ""oh no"" and try to stop it but as they are tiny files I am not fast enough.  Then inmediately windows defender pops up and ""Trojan detected/quarantained"" or something along those lines shows up. I go like, ""OH NO"".

I check my settings to see what happened, and turns out that Telegram settings treats channels *and* groups separetely. SO, if you disabled auto-downloads in one of them, it's not disabled in the other. TIL.

**So, anyway.**

I check the windows defender warnings and I get this: 



|Trojan:Win 32/LumnaC.GNM!MTB|
|:-|
|Infected file: BLTools v4.5.5 New.rar (quarantined)|
|**Trojan:Win32/Vigorf.A**|
|Infected file: Paypal Checker New 2024 Version.rar (quarantined)|
|**Trojan:Script/Wacatac.B!ml**|
|Infected file: Paysafecard Checker 2024 Version.rar (quarantined)|
|**Trojan: Win32/Vigorf.a**|
|Infected File(s): Netflix mail access Checker 2024 New.rar (quarantined)|
|Infected File(s): Nord VPN 2024+Key.rar (quarantined)|

  
So, I decide to run a fast scan with Windows Defender, and it shows no (other) infections. *hooray!*

Then I decide to run a full scan with Windows Defender, and it shows *this* other infection *(oh shit)*: 



|Trojan:Win32/Leonem|Status: Active|

So... I looked it up and that last Trojan rar is still in the Telegram Downloads file.

Along with like, 10 other files and images downloaded at the same exact time. Some of them in Russian. PDFs, one video video webm, pngs, and a json file. 

It seems like it was an abandoned +4 months old telegram group or chat with no admins where people just dumped stuff there, and it had like 5 .rar Trojans in it's chat uploads.

\---------------------

Ok so, I haven't goten infected by a virus in like... 10 years? And I am a bit lost on what to do.

Currently I am about to quarantaine/remove the ""actice"" Trojan. Next I am going to run windows defender in offline mode. Next I am going to install Malwarebytes and run a secondary scan. 

But I have some questions.

* First, as the .exe files are compressed in .rar files, I understand that I haven't become ""infected"", as I have not decompressed them in any way, much less executed the .exe files. Am I right?
* Second. The Trojan that escaped being instantly quarantained (Leonem) was flagged by Windows Defender as ""active"" on the scan because it wasn't quarantained in the moment it was downloaded. My question is, as it is another .rar file it is not active active as in the Trojan has *activated* on it's own from inside the .rar and infected me, right? It just means that the file is active as in *not retrained* yet, as in ""free"" until I do something about it. Am I... right?
* Third. Should a Trojan be active as in activated, how would you proceed? This is my personal computer and I have basically... everything here. I don't want to nuke all my personal files. I have a main SDD where the infection/infected files are, and two HDDs where I keep a big part of my stuff. Is everything everywhere compromissed?

* Would uploading the other compromissed files to VirusTotal solve anything? I say this as I think the smart thing would be to delete them through Windows Defender outright rather than let them linger, and if I delete them I can't upload those files.
* How do I go about purging all the other weird PDFs, pngs, and stuff that were downloaded at the same time? Recycle bin and that's it?
* Also... I haven't had a virus in over a decade so I feel like complete uninformed on nowadays risks. It doesn't seem like a very dangerous or active Trojan. Should I worry about other computers sharing the same Wi-Fi getting infected or the Trojans spreading from my computer to other computers? (I know it's probably a stupid question but I wanted to get everything out of my chest)

Could you guys help me?

1k1n52j,https://i.redd.it/hsxirz5bigve1.png,I am I right about men getting mixed signals about approaching women here?,"I noticed when it comes to conversations about men not approaching women anymore due to social stigma. Women like to play this game where they muddy the waters.

Whenever a man says he doesn't romantically approach women because he doesn't want to come off as creepy or make a random woman feel uncomfortable. 

A woman advice here is  usually about how men don't know how to treat women like normal human beings. Saying how men should talk to women with no strings attached or asking women out for coffee as friends. And saying how men have nothing to worry about when approaching women romantically.

Not that I disagree here. It's the fact that this advice has nothing to do with men forming romantic relationships with women. Even though that's how women are framing this advice here. Since it's a response to men saying they are not romantically approaching women anymore due to it being creepy in society. Which defeats the point of the conversation in the first place.

By telling men they can easily romantically approach women without being called creepy/predatory. All they have to do is have no romantic interest in the women they are romantically approachinng. 

WHAT?

So let me get this straight. if a man sees a woman he is interested in. He can approach her and he wouldn't be call a creep. He just has to treat this women as a normal person. But also if he approaches a woman with romantic intentions. That is bad because he is automatically viewing the woman as an object, not a human.

So my question to them here. Are men looking for romantic female partners or female friends? Which is it? It can't be both at the same time. Because how the fuck can men approach women as friends and have romantic intentions at the same time?

I honestly don't think women are confused here. I think they are mudding the waters on purpose here. Since a lot of women (including progressive women) still have a expectation for men to approach them first.

So if men are not adhering to this gender role expectation. One way women can easily shame men into adhering here. Is by painting men who don't approach women as socially awkward dorks who don't understand women. 

By making it seem like men can't treat women like normal people in everyday conversations. When the real reason is about women still wanting men to pursue them.

It's almost like a strawman argument or a Kafka trap argument women are using here. As a response to men who interact with women less due to stigma.

To use an analogy here.

It's like the Mafia having a legitimate front like a restaurant. But they are doing illegal activities behind the scenes.

I.E. the front is saying that men are just socially awkward and don't know how to interact with women in everyday situations. But behind the scenes it's just an excuse to make sure that men always make the first move when it comes to romance.

If you really wanted men to approach women as friends. You would never respond to men saying they don't romantically approach women in the first place. Because romance has nothing to do with friendship. So this is how someone exposes their true intentions here.

But women know that though. But yet they are still pretending like they don't know this. And they are doing that on purpose.

   **Usage:** If you primarily use the tumbler for shorter activities or have access to frequent refills, the 32 oz is adequate. the 40 oz is better suited for long hikes, extended travel, or situations where refills are limited.
   **Price:** The 40 oz Hydro Flask typically carries a higher price tag due to the increased material and manufacturing costs.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on your individual needs and preferences. If you prioritize portability and convenience, the Hydro Flask 32 oz is an excellent option. If you require a larger capacity for extended hydration, the 40 oz might be a better fit.

## Key Features Analysis

The best bar trays of 2025 are expected to showcase a blend of innovative design, high-quality materials, and practical features.

**Material and Construction:** Bar trays are expected to be crafted from a variety of materials, including stainless steel, wood, acrylic, and even enduring alternatives like bamboo. Stainless steel trays offer durability and a sleek, modern look, while wooden trays provide warmth and a classic aesthetic. Acrylic trays are lightweight and often come in vibrant colors and patterns.High-quality construction ensures that the tray can withstand the weight of bottles, glasses, and other bar accessories without warping or cracking.

**Size and Shape:** The optimal size and shape of a bar tray depend on your specific needs and the layout of your bar area. Larger trays are ideal for serving multiple drinks or displaying a full bottle set, while smaller trays are better suited for more intimate settings.Round trays offer a more casual and sociable feel, while rectangular trays provide a more structured and organized presentation. Depth is also an meaningful consideration; a tray wiht raised edges helps prevent spills and keeps items securely in place.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The design of a bar tray should complement the overall style of your home bar. Modern trays often feature clean lines,minimalist designs,and metallic finishes,while more customary trays may incorporate intricate patterns,carved details,or vintage-inspired elements. The choice of color and texture can also considerably impact the tray's aesthetic appeal. Look for trays that reflect your personal taste and enhance the visual appeal of your bar area.

**Handles and Portability:** For convenient carrying, handles are an essential feature. Ergonomically designed handles ensure a agreeable grip, even when the tray is fully loaded. The placement and construction of the handles can also contribute to the overall sturdiness and balance of the tray. Some trays feature foldable handles for easy storage when not in use. The weight of the tray itself also influences portability; lighter materials make it easier to maneuver.

**Surface and Spill Resistance:** The surface of a bar tray should be durable, easy to clean, and resistant to stains and scratches. Many trays feature a non-slip surface to prevent glasses and bottles from sliding around. Spill resistance is another crucial factor; raised edges and water-resistant coatings help contain accidental spills and protect the underlying surface.Removable liners or mats can simplify cleaning and maintenance.

## Core Benefits

The advantages of using a high-quality bar tray extend beyond mere aesthetics, offering practical improvements to your hosting experience.

**Enhanced Organization:** A bar tray provides a dedicated space for organizing your essential barware, from liquor bottles and mixers to glasses and garnishes.Keeping everything neatly arranged on a tray not only looks more appealing but also makes it easier to locate and access what you need when preparing drinks. This streamlined organization can significantly reduce clutter and improve the overall efficiency of your bar area.

**Improved Presentation:** A well-chosen bar tray elevates the presentation of your drinks and enhances the overall ambiance of your gatherings. Whether you're serving cocktails, wine, or other beverages, a stylish tray adds a touch of sophistication and makes your guests feel more special. A neatly arranged tray also showcases your attention to detail and demonstrates your commitment to providing a memorable hosting experience.

**Increased Convenience:** A bar tray makes it easier to transport drinks and barware from one location to another. Instead of carrying individual items, you can load everything onto the tray and move it all at once. This is particularly useful when serving guests in different areas of your home or when clearing away empty glasses and bottles after a gathering. The handles provide a secure grip and help prevent spills during transport.

**protection of Surfaces:** By containing spills and preventing scratches, a bar tray helps protect your furniture from damage. Whether you're serving drinks on a coffee table,dining table,or bar counter,a tray provides a barrier between the beverages and the surface below. This is especially important for delicate or easily stained materials like wood or marble. The raised edges of the tray further minimize the risk of spills seeping onto the underlying surface.

Here are 7 Effective Tips for Managing Multiple Off-Market Investments.



Number 1, build a strong network. You gotta know the right people—agents, brokers, contractors—who deal with off-market properties. Go to local meetups, join online groups, and keep those connections alive with casual chats or coffee. These relationships often open doors to deals you won’t find anywhere else.



Number 2, develop systematic processes. Create a checklist with your must-have deal criteria like location, condition, and ROI. Use property analysis software to speed up evaluating deals so you don’t waste time on properties that don’t fit your goals. It keeps your decisions sharp and quick.



Number 3, organize your property management. Use software to track everything from rent payments to maintenance schedules and tenant info all in one place. Setting reminders for lease renewals or inspections stops small issues from turning into big headaches.



Number 4, hire reliable property management. Having a good team handle daily tasks like tenant communication and repairs frees you up to focus on growing your portfolio. If you want to do it yourself, make sure your team is well-trained for the unique off-market challenges.



Number 5, implement technology solutions. Automate rent collection, maintenance requests, and tenant communications with apps and software that keep things running smoothly. This tech boost lets you spend less time on daily chores and more on smart decisions.



Number 6, regularly inspect and maintain properties. Stick to a maintenance schedule and do inspections often to catch problems early. This not only saves money but keeps your tenants happy and protects your investment's value.



Number 7, keep detailed financial records. Use accounting tools to track income, expenses, and profits for each property. Reviewing these numbers regularly helps you spot trends and make better investment choices.

I understand that I mix the drink and then dump it into some milk. How much milk?

I leave the milk to curdle Do I leave it at room temperature or refrigerate?

Then strain it several times. I plan to use a gold filter from a coffee machine.

Can I just use a normal daiquiri recipe or do you need to alter it to be ready for milk washing?

If you think this fits better elsewhere, let me know).

So I (22NB) work at a walk-up/drive thru coffee shop. This means there's no seating area, and only employees on shift can be in the building. We also make tips, which are divided by a shift lead manually when we clock out or slightly before. Wages are direct deposit, tips are cash.

All of this is background for what happened the other day: I clocked out about 5 minutes after my shift ended and let everyone know so someone could take my spot. The shift lead wasn't done dividing tips though, so I couldn't leave.

I wait.

Then my manager (\~24F) asks me to make a drink. I tell her that I will, but remind her I'm clocked out, since it's 15 minutes after my shift ended. She tells me that I shouldn't clock out until the shift lead is done with tips, since I can't leave yet, and I'm in the building anyway. Now, it might be rude of me, but I'm not doing that.

She thinks that I shouldn't be in the building and not working, and since I have to be in the building, I might as well still be clocked in. She's also said before that making things run smoothly is everyone's responsibility. Plus, it's only a few minutes.

I say that none of that matters, because *my shift is over*. My manager can ask me to stay late, and I don't mind doing so every once in a while, but I'm not going to make it a regular thing. If she doesn't want me in the building and not working, she should let me leave on time by having the shift lead start counting tips earlier. If she wants me to stay later, she should schedule me for later. I'm not going to extend my shift, even by a few minutes, for my coworkers' convenience.

OK, so I've been dating this woman (34 yo) for a couple of weeks now. I'm a male, 40 yo and has mild ADHD. First date was basically a walk with her dog and first thing I noticed was she hardly made any eye contact and the conversation was mainly focused on the dog. Second date : met at her favourite spot for coffee, walked the dog again and ended up in the pub ; this is where I initiated physical contact, only held a hand for very short time and noticing her dog was resting her head on my lap she said ""Oh look my dog loves you already"". She then left realizing she had to feed dinner to her dog and she hugged me goodbye. Third date was this past Monday : she flat out texted me ""would you like to meet today if you're not busy?"" Even though it was raining and she wasn't well the evening before. I let her pick the place and we went to a fancy pub, well decorated old building etc. This time she didn't have the dog so we could focus on talking about something else. She put up some make up and her eye contact became much more intense than the other dates, she started to smile a lot as well. So we're ordering food, talking about our experiences including her failed relationship she had back in 2018, her travels and her dad's bad temper... At some point, I went to order something at the bar and when I came back to the table she started to sob so I gently took her hand and asked her what was wrong. She said she feels like she's never been able to accomplish anything : not having a paid job, not being able to afford a flat (she lives with her parents at the moment). We then changed subject so she would think about ""happy"" things. Later on I suggested than we should go to that pub we both like that has live music (I am myself a musician but that night I showed up too late to sign up at the open mic). Anyway, as we sat next to each other on the sofa in the pub, I noticed more indicators that she started to really like me : more eye contact, smiling every time I look at her, crossed legs toward me and more importnat I made her giggle with my funny side... But at the same time she kept her hands between her legs as she didn't want anyone to touch her hands (maybe I'm just imaging things). I thought I was going to kiss her during that moment but was like ""is it the right place, the right time? Maybe she's not ready after her failed relationships"". I heard that autistic people don't like physical touch/kissing as much as non-autistic. As it got very late, I walked her to a taxi and she gave me a hug. The day after (Tuesday afternoon) she texted ""Thank you for a lovely evening yesterday, I really enjoyed myself"". And an hour later, noticing I didn't check my whatsapp : ""Hope you had a nice day today"". Now the real question is : Is she looking for a relationship or seeing me as a good friend?

•	Framework paths cleaned up 
•	App patched and rebuilt 
•	Tested on a MacBook Pro 16” M1 Max, running macOS 15.4.1 Sequoia

What works: 
•	App launches instantly 
•	Interface is detected right away 
•	You can adjust all settings: routing, EQ, mixer etc. 
•	Audio is passed through perfectly

Known issue: Sometimes the app hangs on quit. You’ll have to force quit it via Activity Monitor or “Force Quit”. But that’s really the only issue I’ve found so far.

⸻

Why this fix? The last official version wouldn’t even open on modern systems – mainly due to Qt framework mismatches. I’ve bundled all necessary frameworks directly into the app so it’s self-contained and doesn’t rely on system-wide Qt installs anymore.

- **Don’t Skip the Sear:** For meats and some vegetables, a quick sear after sous vide cooking creates appealing textures and aromas.
- **Experiment with Time and Temperature:** Sous vide is very forgiving. Adjust based on your taste, but follow recipe guidelines to avoid undercooking or overcooking.

Tips and Tricks for Mastering Sous Vide Cooking: Essential Tools and Techniques for First-Timers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div> If you're stepping into the world of sous vide cooking for the first time, it helps to know some essential tips and tricks to get the most from this precise and convenient cooking method. Sous vide means ""under vacuum"" in French, and it involves cooking food inside sealed bags at a controlled temperature in a water bath. This technique ensures consistent results and often brings out flavors and textures you can't achieve with traditional cooking. Here’s what you need to get started and how to master sous vide cooking.

### Choosing Your Essential Sous Vide Tools

 First up, having the right equipment will save you time and headaches. Here are the basic tools every beginner should have:

- **Sous Vide Immersion Circulator:** This is the heart of sous vide cooking, heating the water and keeping the temperature stable. Look for one that’s easy to attach to your pot and has accurate temperature control.
- **Container or Pot:** You need a heat-safe container for your water bath. A deep pot or a sous vide-specific container works well. Depth matters because the water level must cover your bags completely.
- **Vacuum Sealer or Ziplock Bags:** Vacuum sealers remove air and tightly seal your food, but high-quality ziplock bags designed for sous vide are good for beginners. Make sure to eliminate as much air as possible from the bag to ensure even cooking.
- **Clips or Weights:** These keep your bag submerged and in place during cooking. Bag clips stick to the container’s side, or small weights can hold your food down.
 
### Mastering the Basics of Temperature and Time

 Understanding temperature and time is crucial. Different foods require different settings to bring out their best texture and flavor.

- **Meat:** Beef often tastes best around 130°F (54°C) for medium-rare. Chicken should be cooked to 145°F (63°C) for tender, juicy results, higher than the USDA’s traditional recommendation because sous vide pasteurizes at lower temperatures.
- **Fish:** For a silky texture, set the temperature between 120°F-130°F (49°C-54°C).
- **Vegetables:** These usually take longer — from 30 minutes to several hours — depending on density. Root vegetables often need 1 to 2 hours at around 183°F (84°C).
 
 Following the exact temperature and time charts from trusted recipes will help you avoid over- or under-cooking your meals.

### Prepping Food for Best Results

 Preparing your ingredients properly is just as important as setting the right temperature. Here are some pointers:

- **Season Generously:** Salt, herbs, and spices penetrate the food during sous vide cooking, making flavors richer. Don’t hesitate to season before sealing.
- **Use Fresh Ingredients:** Because sous vide gently cooks food for extended periods, fresh ingredients give better flavor and texture.
- **Bag It Right:** Use high-quality, food-safe bags. Make sure the seal is tight and airtight. Removing air prevents floating and uneven cooking.
 
### Maintaining Water Bath and Safety

 Proper water management ensures your food is cooked safely and evenly every time.

- **Keep the Water Level Consistent:** Water can evaporate during long cooking times. Check periodically and top it off with hot water.
- **Use a Lid or Cover:** Cover your container with a lid or plastic wrap to minimize evaporation and conserve heat.
- **Monitor Temperature:** While immersion circulators keep temperature steady, occasionally double-check with a separate thermometer to ensure accuracy.
 
### Finishing Techniques to Impress

 Once your food is perfectly cooked sous vide, it often needs a final touch to develop appealing textures and flavors. Searing is a popular finishing step.

- **Searing Meat:** Remove your steak, chicken, or pork from the bag and pat it dry to get a great crust. Use a hot skillet with a small amount of oil or butter for 30 seconds to 1 minute per side. This creates the delicious Maillard reaction without overcooking.
- **Broiling or Grilling:** For added smoky flavor, use a grill or broiler for a quick sear after sous vide cooking.
