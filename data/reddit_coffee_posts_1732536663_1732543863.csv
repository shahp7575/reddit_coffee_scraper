1gzjmix,https://www.reddit.com/r/beholder/comments/1gzjmix/did_someone_else_encounter_these_bugsglitches/,Did someone else encounter these bugs/glitches?,"Hi everyone, I’ve been a Beholder fan and player for a while and I would like to ask if I was the only one who encountered the following bugs/glitches.

  
1) **wedding arrest glitch –** maybe it’s supposed to be a gameplay mechanic, but i’m not sure. It happened to me a few times – I’d have Alloisus marry Sarah and just as the wedding was happening, I would report Sarah. The police would come, arrest her during the wedding and take her away. The cutscene with Alloisus drinking the poisoned coffee would never happen, I’d get the cruise tickets from a dialogue option, and he’d stay indefinitely in the house. I used to do that so that treating Martha would be cheaper. However, when I once attempted to do so, the cops came, stood by the house the entire wedding and only then came in to make an arrest – and Alloisus ended up dying.



2) **zombie Anna glitch –**

I don’t remember exactly how did I do that, but I think I bought the radio for Anna in the very last second. She went and was trampled by the crowd. Her body was taken and she was gone, but the funeral cutscene never played and I was not made cover the funerary expenses. There were no dialogue options concerning her death. I also believe the price to escape the country was somewhat lessened. But when I ran away, she was there with me.

  
3) **DeSalvo’s ghost** – sometimes, when leaving DeSalvo’s tortue room, I’d find that for a second his spirit sits by his table. ",1,1732543708.0,beholder,0,1.0,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1732543340.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

1gzjedo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1gzjedo/how_do_you_talk_to_guys/,How do you talk to guys?,"I (22F) have never had guy friends nor have I been in a relationship. Ever. 

I'm a big introvert and find it difficult to talk to girls let alone guys. But somehow I manage to talk to girls fine because we can usually find some relatable topic to speak about.

But I never had guy friends in school or in college either. 

I'm not looking for a relationship right now per se but seeing my friends and parents discuss about marriage and my cousins weddings has made me realise that even if the ""no love marraige"" barrier in my family was not there, I wouldn't even know how to get a guy myself! But even for a future arranged marriage, I don't know how I'd even talk to the guy and see if we're compatible or not. Like how do you physically talk to guys? How do you talk to them without sounding stupid or offending them os sounding lame? Ik it sounds stupid but please bear with me here. 

I've never had more than a 5 minute conversation with a guy. It's mostly been friends or college batchmates who I've been put into groups with for projects, etc and even then it's basically just exchanging pleasantries or talking about the matter at hand. Like ""this is the plan for this project"" or ""can you give me this"", etc. I've never talked to a boy casually for anything like about his life or my life or even about general stuff like politics or sports or current events, etc.

How do I get over this fear of seeing guys as something alien? 

I have a good relationship with the men in my family like my dad, my brother, my uncles, grandfather's, etc. It's very easy to talk to them. 

It's when it's outside people that I freeze up. Like even if a guy cracked a joke with me, I just pause and then it becomes awkward and they go away. Or I end up saying something lame and they just smile and say ah ok and move on.

I've seen my girl friends be so comfortable and casual with guys like they go out for snacks or just sit and talk (non-relationship wise). And it seems so easy for them. 

It's also not a case of my family being conservative or anything. Maybe once or twice when I was younger they might have mentioned no love marriage, dating etc. But after that it's never been a conversation. Like they are chill with guys as long as they are friends but I cant even manage to have a single convo with a guy, forget relationships!. Both my parents even have friends of opposition genders that they are close and friendly with. My mom has a friend group which meets up every once or twice a year and half of them are guys and she's very close to them. Like she regualrly calls them to just talk and gossip with and no one, even my dad's side has any problem with it. So its not that my family is super conservative. My dad also has female colleagues and college friends who he meets up with for work stuff, or weddings, parties and conferences and all. No one in my family have a problem with having guy friends. Even my grandparents on both sides have opposite gender friends from their school days who they are close to even after 50 years!

I think it's stuck in my mind that ""Good girls don't talk to guys"" thing. I've always tried to be a  ""sanskari bacchi"" even though no one in my family told me to be. My parents even encourage me to go out for dinner or tea and coffee with friends even if there are guys in the group (platonically ofc) but I back out as soon as I see that there are guys there. I don't know where this fear is coming from. I think of guys as some alien beings from another planet who I can't talk to. 

It's not even that it's some deep rooted fear of like past trauma or SA. I've never been around men I can't trust and I've never experienced any kind of abuse from men. 

I saw my roommate talking to her guy friends and seniors every day at night and it baffles me how she does it. Like how do you connect with a guy?

How do I get over this fear of talking to guys or joking around with them even in a platonic way?

Ik I seem pathetic but I can't talk about this to my parents or friends without seeming like a loser. Please give me some advice. I'm not some femcel. I don't hate guys or anything. I'm just scared of talking to them.",1,1732543089.0,AskIndianWomen,3,1.0,False

1gzjckl,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gzjckl/how_do_i_get_my_friend_to_accept_that_hes/,How do I get my friend to accept that he's depressed?,"My good friend has been struggling for a while now with his job. He's a school teacher and works in a very stressful environment. It's an inner-city charter elementary school—under funded, poorly administered, lots of troubled kids. For almost as long as I've known him, his job has been a major stressor. He vacillates between quitting and ""grinning and bearing it"", the latter of which he's always done. Lately though he's been having a much harder time. The last time I saw him in person and talked to him in mid-October he broke out into tears talking about his job, and more specifically wondering if he chose the right career path.

About a week and a half ago he bailed on coming out for my birthday celebration, which really peeved me. It was a big celebration that he knew I had been preparing for for weeks, and I even picked the date partially to accommodate his schedule. And after that, I didn't really hear from him at all. I was mad at first, but I didn't tell him that.

So I reached out by text and he started getting flippant. He told me how his job is really stretching him thin these days, and then started talked about how he wants to be alone for a few weeks. He mentioned he's bailed on other friends, alluded to money issues, and lamented he hasn't seen his family, who are on the other side of the country. But he insisted he isn't depressed, which he said on his own, i.e. I didn't ask him if he was depressed.

His tone was spicy and he was being weirdly evasive. He agreed a couple of weeks ago to petsit for me while I go away for Thanksgiving, but with the text conversation we were having, I asked him to confitm he still would. He bailed on that too, which left me in a bit of a bind to try to find a new sitter last minute. I wouldn't say he was burning bridges, but he definitely wasn't building or reinforcing any.

He's said he's content being alone right now, but it's all very strange. I've tried to connect over the past couple of days, offering any kind of interaction. I invited him over for dinner, to go to coffee, or just talk a walk around the block. He's been mostly evasive, but he finally agreed to meet this evening for a walk. 

I want to tell him that he is depressed and offer to help him find help and resources (therapy, etc). But I don't want to just be like, ""dude, you're depressed"", because I don't think being so direct would really help. I want to be more compassionate, but I also don't want to be so soft that I'm just dancing around it. 

I care for my friend and am concerned, and I want him to be well. Over the past few months I've gone out of my way to be there for him for other things (e.g. I picked him up after a surgery and helped him a lot while he was immobile). I also suffer from depression and am an introvert, so I'm sure I'm familiar with his headspace.

Any advice you can offer to help me have a productive and compassionate conversation, I'd be so grateful. He lives alone and will be alone for Thanksgiving, and so I don't want his condition to worsen.

Quitting it was the best decision for focus and creativity. My findings - caffeine is an illusion of energy and productivity.,"I work as a startup CTO, been in the software industry for 10+ years now. My work requires great attention to detail + creativity + calmness (I have only recently found that calmness is the most important piece of the formula).

I quit caffeine last month and it's been 42 days now off caffeine - no dark chocolate (or cakes with it), no green/black tea, no coffee.

Prior to quitting, I have tapered down for 2 months from 2-3 cups of coffee / day to 1 coffee cup + 1 green tea cup / day. Taper-down process was extremely helpful before preparing the cold turkey season.

Zero caff trip - Week 1 (W1) was pretty tough; after the first few days I've decided to start exercising early in the morning, collecting all the morning energy into a semi-intense cardio and weight-lifting session. This helped the withdrawal significantly. Also - I took ZMA before sleep (3-4 caps) and Ginkgo Biloba (60mg) 2x per day (morning & after lunch).

Let me tell you - I've been on caffeine for 10+ years now (since I was 17-18, mostly black & green teas back then) and, allow me to emphasize - YOU HAVE NO F\*\*\*\*ING IDEA how deep and blissful your sleep will become.

Cognitive benefits have been incredible - extreme patience with tough problems & decisions, amazing focus, no more sporadic jumping from task to task in the afternoon (when the caff crash comes), calm, no-panic-mode mindset, better short-term and significantly better long-term memory (thank you, Sleep).

Also, as a strange benefit - I need less sleep now, can wake up at 5 or 6AM easily if I go to bed at 10 or 11PM. I get up from bed immediately and feel refreshed.

I feel my caffeine addiction made me a different person:

\- always wired-in; unable to really notice the surroundings or other people's emotions / feelings (you need that when working with people)  
\- always looking for the next bullshit thing to make me feel busy & productive  
\- anxious whenever facing difficult problems (technical or social - like, having hard talks about performance, product direction etc.)  
\- associating my productivity with coffee / tea - meaning - I CAN'T WORK WITHOUT MY MORNING FIX. Also, consuming more coffee / tea whenever feeling anxious or frustrated. It's a vicious cycle.

SUMMARY - try quitting caffeine at least ONCE in your life and don't be afraid. Life's short, so please, try that. You may find caffeine is your biggest enemy or your best friend.

If there’s theater or a board game involved, I’ll gladly show up, but organizing outings that can be called spiritual or very adventurous is not really my thing. I’m not into bars or big social events, but would love to find meetups for board games, yoga, smaller outdoor events, theater, stand-up, or climbing (bonus points for beginner-friendly environments). 

A bit about me:  
- I do yoga (I like it mainly for the ""lying down"" portion) and do random dance moves when walk for coffee.
- I enjoy reading—particularly older books that don’t make me question my life choices. I’m over 40, so enough of questionable choices made. 
- New things? I love trying them, am
less successful at learning them. You’d understand if you saw the bread I baked in covid.
- But I recently tried climbing. I know, it sounds like something I’d do just to seem more interesting, but no, I actually like it. It’s a great way to not think about anything while trying not to fall off a wall. 
- Board games are my jam—if you think you can beat me at Catan or Ticket to Ride, give it a go. I am not competitive, though, and am more about snacks and good conversation. 

Any recommendations for introvert-approved hangouts focused on, well, *mild* social interaction? Also, while I’m a single female, I’d like to find interesting people of both genders and local communities to join, so please don’t automatically send me to the dating apps*.

Fast forward to last week, I finally made it to the boutique to get my hands on it 🤩🤩🤩 

I got it in the medium size to fit my iPad and use it as a “boss girl doing work from coffee shops” bag, and wanted something timeless in pebbled leather so it would last me forever. I treat my things very well, but I can see how a work/everyday bag could easily get scratched. 

The only thing that puts me off is honestly the price. I knew it for months but paying 3.500€ for a bag was still very painful. The leather is also quite tough (I remembered it being more soft and supple) but the SA said it has to be more rigid to keep the structured shape. That said, it’s less rigid than the normal Jackie, so it’s more comfortable to carry (especially in this size).

1gzj7ig,https://i.redd.it/p6hla7ndy13e1.jpeg,How to Order Tea or Coffee in German 🇩🇪  ,"How to Order:

1.	Basic Phrases:

•	Ich hätte gern eine Tasse Kaffee, bitte.

(I would like a cup of coffee, please.)

•	Könnte ich bitte einen Tee bekommen?

(Could I get a tea, please?)

•	Ich möchte einen schwarzen Kaffee, bitte.

(I would like a black coffee, please.)

•	Haben Sie auch Kräutertee?

(Do you also have herbal tea?)

•	Kann ich Milch und Zucker dazu haben?

(Can I have milk and sugar with that?)

2.	Specific Orders:

•	Ich hätte gern einen Cappuccino, bitte.

(I would like a cappuccino, please.)

•	Für mich einen grünen Tee, bitte.

(For me, a green tea, please.)

•	Gibt es koffeinfreien Kaffee?

(Do you have decaffeinated coffee?)
	
•	Ich nehme einen Espresso, bitte.

(I’ll take an espresso, please.)

•	Können Sie den Tee mit Zitrone servieren?

(Can you serve the tea with lemon?)

***Cultural Notes Just For You*** 😊 : 

1.	Politeness:

In Germany, being polite is crucial. Always use bitte (please) and say Danke (thank you) after receiving your order. A phrase like Ich hätte gern… or Könnte ich bitte… is considered more polite than just saying Ich will… (I want…).

2.	Self-Service Cafés:

In some German cafés or bakeries (Bäckereien), you may need to order at the counter and carry your drink to the table yourself. Look for signs like Selbstbedienung (self-service).

3.	Coffee Culture in Germany:

Germans love their coffee and tea breaks, especially in the afternoon with a slice of cake. This is called Kaffee und Kuchen. If you’re ordering during this time, pairing a drink with dessert is common.

4.	Tea Options:

While coffee is more popular, many cafés offer a good selection of teas like Schwarzer Tee (black tea), Grüner Tee (green tea), Kräutertee (herbal tea), or Früchtetee (fruit tea). Always ask if you prefer something specific.

5.	Tipping 💶 :

When you’re finished, it’s customary to round up the bill slightly when paying. For example, if your total is €4.50, you can give €5 and say Stimmt so (keep the change) to show appreciation.

[GME's Price Action as of the Week of 25 Nov 2020 - Always worth the refresher!](https://preview.redd.it/w0u83ot0x13e1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=506937fa149940f8d609d4bebdc49274d27b30ee)

From the looks of it, Market Makers were able to control our trading well-enough to avoid a code-red Gamma Ramp scenario last Friday. However, they did so only by retaining the stable trading structure of our upward trend. Will we see $30 this week? Will that trend stay stable? Let's take a look at our data and find out!

**Price Movement Recap**

[GME Trading Day 11\/22 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/sdwiylsmy13e1.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ce951e4adc7497a31bb3956969f857b8fbdaf88)

Friday's trading displayed high convergence to the price movement scenario I assumed Market Makers would seek to shape with respect to our gamma hedging structure from premarket last Friday. I'll reiterate my comments:

[Post URL: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Superstonk\/comments\/1gx8q7y\/comment\/lyg350i\/](https://preview.redd.it/o0scz18vx13e1.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0025df16bc10757834e09a1e0efa782235b51d2)

If you want to review how I came to this conclusion, you can specifically take a look at my rationale in the Gamma Exposure section of last Friday's post. There isn't too much to comment on here outside of the fact that what we got on Friday conformed exactly to what I laid out, namely that relative Bears (in this case MMs) limited our downward price action in order to avoid a test of $27 and the 50-4hr Simple Moving Average on our initial downward price action. The price was after about 15-20min of price action battle taken instead up into the $28-$29 tight gamma hedging bracket in order to pin the price in a low volatility zone and quash potential for a Friday gamma ramp run that might have seriously threatened MM profitability.

After this initial upward momentum ran out of steam in the direct center of that $28-$29 gamma hedge bracket, we saw limited trading activity as MMs shed their share hedges on OTM short Call delta loss over time (Charm) and theta decay. It is difficult to say whether the reversal we saw to the upside of $27.42 in the closing minutes of the day was another attempt to keep the price away from touching the 50-4hr SMA or whether this was a small reversal from intraday Short traders closing out their scalps after capturing that $1 Charm-induced move from $28.46 to $27.42 and not wanting to hold over the weekend (again, given the strong possibility of reversal as noted last Friday).

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

The only real mover in terms of OI amid Friday's comparatively low volume (under 8mil, our lowest total since the Post-Cat Day cool off) was, understandably, 11/29.

[11\/29 OI Changes 11\/22-11\/25](https://preview.redd.it/nkfplst4x13e1.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=87765573f735ce35fd7a3795d437e2d0cd93985c)

We still had very little activity below $25 on Friday and low Put activity overall. Indeed, our largest increase in Put OI was just under 800 contracts at $27 and our largest Put strike overall is $25 with just under 3500 contracts. On the Call side, increases in OI overall were generally pretty modest - except at $30 where we had an OI increase of over 6000 new Calls just last Friday. Premium sentiment at this strike was dead even during Friday's trading with 9000 Contracts traded apiece at the BID and ASK. We did get two orders of 1,000 contracts each at the ASK just before 12pm and at 1pm, though it is difficult to know given the noise of high trading volume whether these orders were to open or close.

https://preview.redd.it/ra3z8kakx13e1.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c54f9de90a48490c510896b55ea5bf63e26c09

ChartExchange has Max Pain for this week where it was last Friday at $24, but Maximum-Pain is currently reporting 11/29 Max Pain as $25. If $25, this would indicate that, just like all of last week, Max Pain is continuing its climb upward and is placing MM optimal profitability much closer to our current elevated trading range and price levels than in weeks prior. This is a bullish sign. How bullish, is a separate matter of consideration. If $24, this is still certainly not a bad sign.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/7eo951m6x13e1.png?width=430&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9a563b8962f483f3ef8375223641502a5d8c18a

Our Daily Put-to-Call GEX ratio is back trending in the 1:4 area after Friday's gamma wipe. This continues to project stable, bullish trading.

https://preview.redd.it/ixwfg3h7x13e1.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=a834e1fe2e0e628263b5429e4253066c606ba04b

This past Friday's gamma wipe has thinned out our trading range overall leaving only substantial Call Gamma concentrations at our big anchor-strikes of $25, $30, and $35. With most of our strikes pretty light on total gamma exposure accumulation, $28-29 stands out as our most likely intraday trading range much as it served last Friday. We show negligible negative gamma accumulation below this range with some milder stability still present at $27 and $26 and the Call Strikes of $31, $32, and $33 still retaining a non-negligible amount of Call Gamma carried over from our trading last week.

Bullish traders and institutions will be aiming to keep the price elevated above $28 in order to maintain and create opportunities for Call buying to grind our price closer and closer to the $30 Call Wall in the hopes of a breach and hold in the coming weeks.

Market makers, as relative bears on the other hand, while accepting the status quo of our upward moving trend, will likely want to drag out our trading below $30 for as long as possible and see the price grind between $28-$30 on this short week. I conjecture that, based on this set-up, they would want to see new Call OI insert itself above $30 in substantial numbers in order continue to profit as optimally as possible from their Options Dealing strategies. Thus, barring any major news, I'd expect their aim would be to keep trading tight and contained in the $28-$30 range without threatening major deviations from our technical paradigm as we'll see below.

It is probably worth pointing out at the same time that we don't have much Gamma Hedging support underneath $28. We don't have a lot of Put Gamma, so the options market isn't exactly setting up for a Bearish reversal in the near term. However, if for some reason some big bearish volume did hit the tape, we could conceivably slip a bit into the $28-$25 range with decent velocity until enough Call Gamma got put in place to slow things down a bit. I don't see this prefigured in our technicals, but, again, it's worth mentioning this particular feature of our GEX structure. With that being said $25 is a strong Call GEX position that would backstop an unexpected movement to the downside should on the outside chance it show up.

**Technicals**

[10\/15-11\/25 4-hr Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/zv3jq1j8x13e1.png?width=1496&format=png&auto=webp&s=991871890d8cfab1d96d400ce72a0ca9eff1db00)

Trading continues to respect the upward-trending paradigm guided by the 50-4hr Simple Moving Average, the white line displayed above. As we have seen throughout this paradigm, a touch of the 50-4hr SMA has also coincided with a small dip below RSI Neutral (=50) which has served as a buy signal for intratrend upside reversals since our movement into this paradigm following Nat'l Cat Day.

There are currently no technical indicators to suggest that this paradigm will stop serving as a framework for our present trend. Thus, the question seems to pertain not the structural integrity of this framework, but rather to how the price is expected to move within this channel in the coming days.

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean Implied Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/0yi85paex13e1.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=791bf35103f2cea2ba66dddf999a770877ce5c6b)

We still do not have an idea from the company itself as to when we can expect to hear the results of the Q3 Earnings report. While brokerages are still estimating Dec 4, I still think our most likely dates are 12/10 and 12/11 and that we won't hear an announcement until midweek this week (just like last quarter, exactly two weeks before the actual report date). When the two week mark is reached, this will begin an anticipatory earnings IV appreciation trend that will build on top of whatever IV levels we are seeing at day T-14 Calendar Days to the Q3 report, as we have seen for the past two years.

**Forward-Looking Remarks - Wen $30?**

I wanted to take a few moments to bring together our data from multiple sections and seek some insight into this week's trading as a whole.

As $30 continues to loom large as a an overhead and as our gap between our average trading range and this overhead narrows, we have a substantial question facing us: when will the price overtake $30?

On any given week, Market Makers can accept bullish movement in a particular stock, but preferably if it proceeds at a pace which permits their Market-Making strategies to continue to turn a profit. Otherwise, certain conspicuous infelicities just \*happen\* to show up on our intraday charts somehow permitting trading to close out the week in ways that avoid jeopardizing their profitability.

As I have pointed out especially over the past two weeks (with a granted speculative causality) we have seen targeted, but still subtle manipulations of the price action directed and redirected in their favor in ways that have kept the very large $30 Call OI positions OTM and, thus, kept the premium from the sales of these contracts in their pockets.

This week is no exception to the $30 question and profitability assumptions with respect to MM strategies. As we saw above, we have over 25,000 Calls of Open Interest at $30 for 11/29 Weekly expiry with options trading not even having begun yet for this week. That's over $2.3mil in premium value to collect from the OTM expiry of these contracts just based on today's OI just at the $30 strike and just for 11/29 weekly expiry alone.

However, as we look forward in our weekly strikes, we see this OI number decline substantially until 1/17 Quarterly OPEX. Here is the data:

11/29: 25,649  
12/6: 7,287  
12/13: 2,884  
12/20: 12,506  
12/27: 1,587  
1/17: 25,277

December 20 stands out as a larger $30 call position, however our next two weeks of expiries still show $30 as relatively substantial, but absolutely no extravagant Call OI position. If I were a Market Maker looking at our current technical set-up and with a short week on the horizon (no trading Thursday and half day on Friday/1pm Close) I would want to try to fit in one more weekly close beneath $30. This would likely draw in options volume and new OI at whole dollar strikes proximal to, but above $30, spreading out Long-Call demand to lower ITM probability strikes as we continue our march upward.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

Based on my previous remarks, I think the most likely scenario for the week is to trade stably above the 50-4hr moving average with a test and rejection of $30 mid-week that draws in some Call Buying in the $30-$35 range for our next few weeks ahead of earnings before a very slow, Charm + Theta decay dominant trading session on Friday that closes still under $30 EOW.

Any bit of significant news or some untrackable external factor that causes very heavy bullish options volume could transform our landscape profoundly. However, if I had to project a weekly structure from our standpoint now, this is what I would go with. Ultimately, we'll have to continue to monitor how our trading and hedging landscape develops.

Cheers and good luck out there, everyone!

PS: Thanks again to all those who have treated me to coffee for the next few weeks. This week's coffee and newsletter is brought to you by the generosity of '**FrequentPoem**.' Be sure to thank Frequent this week in the comments for supporting our efforts here! Cheers, my friend :)

I've had a lot of generous coffee donors over the past few days and weeks to whom I have had the pleasure of giving shoutouts - I'll be sure to revisit everyone who was generous enough to donate as I drink your coffees! Thank you friends :)

For those of you who are on X, I have, at the encouragement of several users, decided to start crossposting there. These posts will be identical to those found here on Superstonk, so no need to leave the party here. However, just in case there are any 'issues' with my posts in the future, you'll be able to find each and every Open Interest Newsletter in the Articles tab of my profile. Open Interest will remain aimed toward the Superstonk - and GME shareholder - community first and foremost. So, rest assured, this will in no way affect my attention here. @ MichaelTLoPiano if Reddit is down for some reason like last week.

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

In addition to free online copies of old cookbooks, the blog author tried out the recipes and added notes and pictures on how it turned out. She also tried living and meal planning on the actual ration allotments. She also took notes and put out advice on how she ate while sheltering during COVID.

The most interesting part is that she is operating off of the rations that were allotted in the UK. I live in the US and I've heard people speak in awe, confused how Americans in the 40s could live with things like sugar and coffee being rationed. Well, the UK was actively getting bombed, they had stricter rations, and women whose children weren't sent off to the country had to attempt to educate their children while dealing with all of the chaos. 

In case of a bird flu situation, these recipes also make limited use of meat, milk, and eggs because of how strictly they were rationed (1 egg per person per week).

My favorite recipe is the cookies that used shredded carrots instead of sugar. I brought them into work one day and they all disappeared. Hopefully someone finds this helpful!",17,1732542280.0,TwoXPreppers,0,0.95,False

Shopping around, there's a Costco club unit that looks somewhat comparable to the models that are available at Lowes, though the model names (Ultimate) don't quite line up.  Are there any functional or material differences that would lead me away from a Costco club model - like lacking stainless steel internal parts?  

Cost-wise, they seem comparable - with the Costco unit including the power cord.  I also assume both are compatible with an air switch, though it's not called out anywhere.

Ajax invited everybody over for “beer and bowls,” which was just his excuse to get crossfaded and pass out by midnight.



The basement permeated with weed to the point that the air was foggy. Ajax’s cheap coffee table was covered in empty beer cans and a large bong, and Ajax had already melted into the couch.



“Did you bring any rum?” Casmir was sitting on the recliner with Aria. The two were inseparable, especially when booze was involved.



“I brought something better,” I said, pulling out a large, crimson crystal. “Pinched it from my Dad’s collection.”



Aria slid off the recliner. “Are we supposed to crush it and snort it?”



“I’m gonna cast a spell,” I smiled.



“Not cool, bro,” Casmir said, “I don’t like it when you mess with your Dad’s wizard shit.”



“This is gonna be radical, I promise,” I said, placing the crystal gently in the top of Ajax’s bong.



I took a deep breath, concentrated, and recited the spell I stole from my Dad’s tome.



“**ßřęąťħ ĹįfƐ ƑǒřƎṽƏṛḾơrę**.”



The crystal started glowing. Two small doves of golden light flew from the crystal and circled the room, shining brilliantly in the smoky air.



“Alright,” I said, pulling out my titanium (+2 sharpness) dagger, “who wants to know what it feels like to die?”



“What the fuck are you talking about?” Casmir asked, getting up from the recliner.



“You’re right, I should go first.” I jammed the knife into my throat and jerked, slicing my jugular open and spilling blood all over.



“What the fuck!” Aria screamed.



The crystal hummed a C-Sharp, and all the blood flowed back into my throat as my neck sealed itself shut.



“*Ta-da*!” I sang while doing jazz hands, “Crystal of Invulnerability! We are now *incapable* of dying. Radical, right?”



Ajax, who had been a vegetable up until this point, finally spoke: “What. The. *Fuck*.”



“It’s my Dad’s rarest crystal. He won’t even tell me how he got it. He refuses to speak about the Hobgoblin Wars.”



“Can I try?” Casmir asked. I handed him the knife, and he stabbed Aria right in the heart.



“Jesus!” She yelled, falling to the ground. Then she got right back up, and pulled the knife out of her chest. “Holy shit, we can’t die!”



“Let the carnage begin!” I said.



“I’ve got an idea,” Ajax said, “let me take a big hit and then stab me in the lungs to see if the smoke comes out.”



Ajax reached for the bong, but in his drunken stupor knocked it over.



“No!” I cried, but it was too late. The crystal hit the ground and shattered, and the faint, glowing doves evaporated. The last person to notice was Aria, who had straddled Casmir and was repeatedly stabbing him in the chest.



“Die, fucker!” She screamed, only relenting when he was full of holes and covered in blood. “Casmir? Casmir, get up.” ",15,1732541643.0,shortscarystories,2,1.0,False

Wow, we not only had snow here, we had _freezing_ temperatures. Older I get, the less charming I find that ..._<laughs>_...

Made for a good time inside though. Well, mostly inside. I attended an award ceremony for someone important in my life. I'm not sure who was more proud; me or them!

..._<goes silent a moment>_...

When my wife died, [I was told a lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/DadForAMinute/comments/122pkta/good_morning_kiddo_its_26_mar_2023_tw_death/) about how to grieve. About how to ""get over it"", ""move on"", and what not. What was intriguing is that most of that came from people who had _not_ lost a life partner. Those I met who did, never said those things. They said it takes time. That you have to go through it. That eventually things get different. The difference between the two groups was not only that one hadn't lived it  -- it was that one was prescriptive in how they thought my grief _should_ be, while the 

..._<nods>_...

Well meaning people said, ""I understand; I lost my parents"", or ""I get it, I divorced"", even ""I know what you feel - my pet died.""

Not the same. Similar feelings but not the same. The same way everyone can understand _a tiny bit_ of depression because we've all been sad, but being sad is not at all the same as being depressed.

..._<is silent again, trying to formulate>_...

The same happens with things like estrangement and trauma. People think they ""get it"" because they has partially similar emotions resulting from partially similar experiences. That's okay; that can be a useful tool to build empathy and understanding. 

But partially similar comes nowhere near to identical. 

Those who haven't lived it, can't understand it fully. And that removes their ability to _prescribe_ how it _should_ be.

..._<thinks>_...

Okay, we may have had _terrible_ cramps. THE. WORST.  Right? ..._<nods>_... And you made it through, somehow, right? ..._<nods>_... But to extrapolate that we know how it feels to go through birthing contractions would be _soooo_ insanely dumb. Right? ..._<nods>_... Right.

..._<takes a sip of coffee, reflects>_...

Your trauma is _your_ trauma. You are the expert on how that experience is.

People may tell you, ""you need to forgive."" I tell them ""F you; let them decide."" Yes, there is a lot of research showing forgiveness can help. But correlation isn't causation. There have been _zero_ double blind studies comparing this. Nor is it shown forgiveness is the component itself; letting go of ruminating about the perpetrator in one's daily thoughts is a huge part of it.

Don't let anyone tell you you _must_ forgive, _have to_ forgive. It's okay to not be okay with it. If you want to hate them, hate them. Take your time doing so. _You_ decide when you're done. And if you want to let go of thinking about them ""all the time"" but still don't want to forgive them -- don't. There's nothing wrong with hate. It's OK to watch the news, see children starving from hunger, and _hate_ it happening. It's OK to see injustice and _despise_ it.  

And if you want to forgive? ..._<gestures widly with arms>_... Nothing wrong with that either. 

But in case you needed to hear it; it's okay not to. Don't _should_ on yourself.

The available selection, time to delivery, freshness, etc. - not perfect, but fine. By now I've found three single origin varieties that I like and that I order regularly. (I'm less fond of their blends.)

One issue, though, is that roast to roast the taste and aroma of their products varies. Sometimes a bit, but sometimes so much that I wondered if I really got the same variety as before. Even the roast level is sometimes visibly different. Last time, it was a lot darker, and the part of the aroma that I liked was very much diminished - and this one was roasted only two weeks after the previous one (so I think it's unliknely the green beans have degraded that badly).

Neither my setup nor my skill are perfect, but by now I get consistently tasty results, and the character of the coffee comes through clearly. And the difference in the roast can be seen by eye and smelled fresh from the bag, before brewing.

To quantify a bit: out of four bags over two months for a single origin product of theirs: two bags were very similar, one was slightly different but recognizable, but one bag was clearly different, and without searching for their characteristic aroma I'd have guessed it's a different roast altogether. Given that I'm not a trained sensory assessor, it could be that the last one was indeed different, and even the diminished aroma a fabrication my mind.

So, my question is - how consistent can a small roaster be, and how consistent do you usually demand them to be?",1,1732541476.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I have used my local Panera for four years and am a Sip Club member. Initially, I bought some salads like strawberry fruit with chicken. Still, they got skimpier, and the chicken got boring as I noticed it was essentially poor-quality deli-style prepared with little flavor. (I've found an actual salad store a walk away that's much better (Roots). I liked the turkey chili, but they got rid of it. However, I get oatmeal, cookies, and bagels daily. For four years, nearly every reward option would include one of those three (oatmeal, cookie/pastry, bagel), and I used them primarily. After about four months, all three of these options stopped cold! WTH? What Panera was making the most money off me, they decided to stop rewarding me for? I understand the marketing to incentivize me to try something else with the two other reward option selections, but bagels/cookies are no longer.

Has anybody else experienced this? The cashiers say the oatmeal rewards have stopped for everyone, but not the bagels or cookies. So, I opened a new account, and, wow! I get cookie and bagel rewards again, just like before. So far, the cashiers have been excellent, letting me use the new account for food and my original account with the sip club membership for coffee. At renewal, I close my old account and renew on my new account. I understand that technically, Panera does not allow more than one membership per person.

Alright, let’s be real—music production isn't just pushing buttons, dragging loops, and sprinkling some reverb on a vocal. It’s much weirder—and way cooler—than that. It’s the modern-day equivalent of alchemy. You're taking raw, messy pieces of sound and trying to turn them into gold… or, at least, something people nod their heads to in traffic.  

But here’s the thing—they don’t tell you how many times you’ll almost quit because your snare doesn’t “spark joy” or your mix sounds like it was recorded underwater. So let’s talk about the chaos, the magic, and the downright frustrating beauty of making music.  

---

### *You're a Mad Scientist With a DAW*
When you open up a blank project, you’re basically saying, “Let’s build a universe from scratch.” Sound dramatic? It’s not. Think about it: You can bend sounds, stack them, reverse them, distort them—all while wearing slippers and sipping coffee.  

- That sound you added? You can pitch it down 10 semitones and turn it into the rumble under your bassline.  
- That one vocal sample? Chop it, throw some reverb on it, and suddenly it’s the emotional centerpiece of your track.  
- Craving chaos? Put a flanger on your hi-hats and watch the world burn (in stereo).  

Somewhere along the way, you realize the software isn't just a tool. It’s a playground. But it’s also a monster that demands both creativity *and* technical precision.

---

### *The Art of Chasing “That” Sound*  
Let’s not forget one universal truth about music production: No matter how good your track sounds, your brain will tell you, “It’s missing *something*.” And let me tell you—a lot of your time will be spent hunting for *that sound.*  

- Spent three hours EQing your kick drum? Classic.  
- Layered six different synth patches for a pad no one will notice? Absolutely.  
- Accidentally found a random factory preset that changed everything? Welcome to the club.  

The key here is to embrace the journey. Sometimes, it takes days to find the right sounds, and other times, a happy accident (shoutout to MIDI controllers malfunctioning) will take your track to a level you didn’t even know was possible.  

---

### *Creativity vs. Perfectionism: The Eternal Fight*
One of the greatest things about music production is that *no one track is ever finished.* I mean, yeah, you can upload it, but tell me you don’t hear five things you’d change every time you listen to it again. You could EQ your snare until the sun explodes, but will anyone really notice?  

Here’s the hard truth:  
- A perfect track doesn’t exist.  
- Done is better than perfect.  
- Someone, somewhere, will love your track *the way it is.*  

The sooner you let go of perfectionism, the sooner you actually release your music. Which—you know—is kind of the point.  

---

### *Community is Your Greatest Weapon*
Quick shoutout to all the music producers out here sharing tips, tricks, and presets on YouTube, Reddit, and Discord. Without the community, this craft can feel isolating in a big way. But find your people—people who’ll give you honest feedback (“This slaps” isn't *always* helpful, but we still love to hear it), or just folks trying to figure out the same stuff as you—and the whole ride gets a bit more fun.  

---

### Final Thoughts: Make Stuff That Excites You
Whether you’re just starting or trying to make your 50th track, remind yourself of why you’re here. Maybe it’s because you love sound design. Maybe it’s because music production gives you the freedom to create without limits. Or maybe…it’s just really satisfying to hear your 808 make someone’s car speakers vibrate.  

At the end of the day, the most important thing is this: create music *you* love. Get weird, get experimental, make mistakes, and fall in love with the process. You’re a music producer—that means you’ve got a little bit of magic in you. Don’t waste it.",1,1732540872.0,Songstuff,0,1.0,False

I used the James Hoffman technique (11g for 200g of water), and it turned out great! I've only ever had commercial cafe coffee and stuff from Mokka, so my palate isnt super developed, but it had a very smooth mouthfeel and was very fruity. No doubt some of that was due to the more consistent grind size, or whatever.

  
A lot of people suggest pre-ground coffee over coffee ground with a cheap grinder, and I can finally see their reasoning, this is a good step above any of the coffee that I brewed with beans I ground with my cheap agaro grinder. However, pre-ground coffee does tend to deteriorate quicker than whole-beans, so I'm skeptical that I'll hold this opinion a week in.

  
Overall, I really liked it, and I also got some easy pour bags as a bonus. Definitely pricier than mokka, but I'd say it was worth the price difference. If you're a beginner looking to get into coffee, go for this one!",3,1732540280.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

Despite the challenges, Emma was determined to find moments of calm amidst the chaos.

One evening, after a particularly rough day at work, Emma found solace in her garden. The act of tending to her plants was a grounding ritual. Each touch of soil and every new bloom reminded her that growth was possible, even when it felt like everything was falling apart.

Emma’s relationship with her partner, Alex, was one of her greatest joys but also one of her biggest challenges. BPD often made her feel intensely insecure and fearful of abandonment. On this night, she decided to open up to Alex about her feelings. They sat on the porch, the setting sun casting a warm glow, as Emma spoke about her fears and struggles. Alex listened with understanding and reassured her that they were in this together.

The next day, Emma had a therapy session. Therapy had become a crucial part of her journey, helping her develop tools to manage her emotions. Her therapist, Dr. Lee, was a guiding light, helping Emma navigate the complexities of her feelings. They worked on techniques to handle intense emotions and practiced ways to communicate more effectively with loved ones.

After therapy, Emma went to her favorite café. The familiar scent of coffee and the hum of conversations provided a comforting backdrop. She spent the afternoon writing in her journal, a practice that helped her process her thoughts and emotions. Each entry was a step towards understanding herself better.

In the evening, Emma attended a support group meeting. Sharing her experiences with others who understood made her feel less alone. The group had become a second family, offering a space where she could be open and honest without fear of judgment.

As the day came to an end, Emma sat on her bed, reflecting on her journey. Living with BPD was never easy, but she was learning to find moments of peace and connection amidst the storm. With the support of therapy, loved ones, and her own resilience, Emma knew she was on a path of growth and healing.",1,1732540072.0,mybpdlife,0,1.0,False

I saw him Friday on a follow up appointment and I have been and I am in pain. Crippled over pain, can’t stand up pain from my back and my tummy has decided to throw a flare. I hurt I need rest and to sleep constantly. I am awake about 9-10 hours a day and the rest I sleep. I work from home so not as bad as could be. I even nap through the day. 

New GP prescribed 5 days steroids if I needed them as I see new consultant next week - urgent referral from the new gp practice to ensure that my biologics don’t get forgotten in the move. 

I saw a different GP the week before to complain of being in pain and symptoms of flare and he suggested pain clinic that takes 2/3 months to get an appointment. So I have to wait but he refused to put me on anything else to do with pain relief. 

Original GP says he doesn’t like to see me like this but refuses to prescribe anything else. And I will just have to wait till I see pain clinic. I can’t wait this long. I can’t even hold a cup of coffee in my right hand, my partner is cutting up my food. Not that I want to eat because of CD flair.

1gziaje,https://www.reddit.com/r/mybpdlife/comments/1gziaje/meet_sam/,Meet Sam,"Sam always felt like they were living on the edge of a cliff, constantly battling the whirlwind of emotions that came with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Each day presented new challenges, but Sam was determined to find stability.

One morning, Sam woke up feeling unusually anxious. They had a presentation at work, and the fear of judgment loomed large. To calm their nerves, Sam decided to take a walk in the park before heading to the office. The crisp air and gentle rustling of leaves provided a momentary escape from their swirling thoughts.

At work, Sam's heart raced as the time for their presentation approached. They took a few deep breaths, reminding themselves of the supportive colleagues who always had their back. The presentation went smoothly, and Sam received praise from their boss, but the fear of failure still lingered in the back of their mind.

During lunch, Sam met up with their friend Taylor, who had been a pillar of support throughout their journey. Over coffee, Sam shared their anxieties and triumphs from the morning. Taylor listened intently, offering words of encouragement and understanding. It was these small moments of connection that kept Sam grounded.

The afternoon was filled with meetings and tasks, but Sam made sure to take breaks when the emotional weight became too much. They had learned the importance of self-care and finding balance. A quick chat with a colleague or a moment of solitude in the break room often helped reset their mind.

After work, Sam headed to a local support group for individuals with BPD. Sharing experiences and hearing others' stories provided a sense of community and belonging. Sam felt less alone, knowing there were others who understood their struggles.

Back at home, Sam spent the evening drawing in their sketchbook. Art had always been a therapeutic outlet, a way to express emotions that words couldn't capture. As they filled the pages with vibrant colors and intricate designs, Sam felt a sense of accomplishment and peace.

Before bed, Sam reflected on the day. Living with BPD was a rollercoaster, but they were learning to navigate the ups and downs. With the support of friends, colleagues, and their own resilience, Sam knew they could face whatever challenges came their way.",1,1732539703.0,mybpdlife,0,1.0,False

Mostly I start drinking it again after not having good sleep and need to get stuff done. But I just can't break the cycle. Everytime I stop drinking it, I get into bad state of mind, become lazy and depressed. And I don't get back to ""normal"". After I drink coffee, I feel fine (in a good mood) for a while but after the third day of drinking it I start to sleep really bad, my heart's racing and I feel dizzy all the time.

I stop it, my heart feels good, I feel more relaxed, but really low on energy, in a brain fog and depressed.

What's going on here? Is it really caffeine only that does this or does coffee contain other substances that cause these kinds of withdrawals? Can anyone provide some scientific grounds for what's going on?

I also read somewhere that coffee acts as an SSRI. Maybe that's what causes the depression which doesn't go away in weeks?

I'm curious to see if you have the same problem I do. Every time I find myself in a new situation (for example, my job, or my move) I find after a short time, that I can confidently do things. For example, not long after moving, I was able to go get a coffee, play my bass in the apartment and sing a little without worrying too much about whether my brothers could hear me. But as usual, fast-forward a few months and the old anxieties have set in. I'm even more self conscious than before and feel like I have to really push myself to get that coffee, play that instrument etc. It's like I don't want to get 'caught' or be seen. Still, I come from an abusive home, so it could well just be that.

1gzi48j,https://www.reddit.com/r/cafesing/comments/1gzi48j/my_notion_of_espresso_extraction/,My Notion of Espresso Extraction,"My notion for making espresso is: **Excellent Espresso Extraction = Even Extraction × Segmented Extraction**. Even extraction is the foundation for a quality espresso, and segmented extraction opens up endless possibilities for flavor exploration, making espresso more exciting.

**Even Extraction**

Even Extraction is a holistic view. Every coffee particle in the basket has a different extract yield rate — this is determined by the coffee particle size, particle position, basket structure, and water characteristics, none of which can be changed.

Even Extraction refers to keeping the amount of over-extracted and under-extracted below the threshold of human perception, at the same time, the bitterness and off-flavors of over-extraction, and the sourness and astringency of under-extraction, to be offset by the properly-extracted flavors. In short, all particles need water to flow through them continuously, plus the good ones neutralize bad flavors. One practical rule is to avoid channeling — keep the water from numerous small uniform channels through the coffee puck instead of one to three big channels.

**Segmented Extraction**

Segmented Extraction is a process perspective. In reality, the different flavors in the coffee puck—acidity, sweetness, bitterness, and off-flavors—are extracted sequentially. Tetsu Kasuya's 4:6 brewing method inspired this idea.

By breaking extraction into stages and adjusting variables for each phase, you can manipulate the extraction yield and rate at each stage, creating more possibilities and flavors.

A variable-pressure espresso machine can achieve a form of Segmented-Extraction by adjusting the pressure. Here's a link to my review of the MUVNA Mach Mechanical Manual Espresso Machine.

I ended up having to yell at P to stop trying to clean up the mess because they kept making it worse. P finally went to bed and I slept on the couch. I left the mess for P to clean up. Sunday morning I get woken up to them washing the sheets and I ask what happened. P just said ‘someone peed on them.’ I rolled my eyes and told P they had a mess to clean up and they said “I don’t even remember last night” and tried to make jokes. I told P that it’s really not funny to me and I’m not in the mood to joke about it. P cleaned the kitchen and passed out on the couch. I let them nap for a few hours before I tried waking them up at about 10am. (We work dayshift and have to be up at 4am Monday morning so I tried to wake them up because if we sleep too late, we won’t get good sleep for work). P got mad at me so I let them sleep and went to lay on the bed. I didn’t realize the per had soaked down to the mattress cover, so I laid in P’s pee. I got pissed and took a shower and while I was in there I guess P woke up so I told them “hey you need to clean the mattress cover.” They got pissed off at me and said “I’m so glad you’ve never made a mistake”. I said “an accident is different than drunkily pissing the bed”. So they said “okay im not cleaning up after you anymore”. I was shocked because I do everything except for dishes and putting clothes away. I said “okay, I’m not cleaning up after you anymore.” They said “that’s fine. Im not lazy like you are.” So P went back to sleep on the couch and I cleaned up all of my messes, did all of my laundry and set up the guest bedroom to sleep in. I don’t want to lie, I’m not great at keeping up with the chores throughout the week but on the weekends I do a big clean and if they wanted something cleaned they could do it.

Taking the stone path leading up the house Trevor thought the yard looked immaculately well kept. Especially considering that the owner was blind.

Peeling back the welcome mat that read *Home Sweet Gnome* he felt for the spare key that had been hidden for him.

 

Stepping inside he was greeted by another gnome statue with a wide smile holding up a tray. “How many more of these ugly things does she have? Strolling through the house Trevor quickly found out that it wasn’t just the yard that was pristinely kept. There wasn’t a single speck of dust to be found anywhere in the house. The kitchen didn’t even have a single stain or crumb of food left out. Throughout the house everything was tidy and tucked away in place. The only thing left haphazardly out of place was a note set out on the coffee table.

 

Scanning over the typed up note the owner had left a list of instructions. It went over every task in the house in excruciating detail from what day the trash picked up to taking care of the roses in the garden. The instructions all seemed too mundane to need this much detail, but something drew his eye to the bottom of the page. Below all the instructions was a line written in by hand reading, *Leave* *the house as you have found it*! Reading it Trevor felt a wave of indignation didn’t need to be told how to do his job. When he looked over the letter again the indignation vanished and replaced by an uneasy feeling in his gut. The entire note had been type up except for the shakily scribble line at the bottom. He wondered if the owner had felt strongly enough to somehow write it in herself and if not who had scratched that into the letter.

 

No longer sporting his carefree expression he decided to take his bag to the bedroom and unpack a few things. Tossing his duffle bag onto the bed he began to take out his clothes glancing around the room. It was sparsely furnished leaving plenty of space to navigate around the extravagant king bed. A small makeup table with a jewelry box and fainting couch lined one side of the room and a bookshelf the other. Trevor froze like a statue midway through unpacking, seeing two more gnome statues staring back from the bookshelf. One was playfully swinging its legs dangling off the shelf while the other scowled, holding his hand above his eyes surveying the land.

“You’ve got to be kidding me! How many of these ugly gnomes does she have?!” Trevor blurted out to himself in disbelief. “There is no way I’m sleeping with those things staring at me all night.

Plucking the gnomes off the shelf he tucked one under each arm surprised by how heavy they were. Struggling with the weight and unwieldy shape he hauled both of them to the backdoor in one trip. Setting the gnomes down to unlock the door he was surprised to see a pet door leading outside. It was strange since none of the detailed instructions had mentioned anything about a cat or dog. He supposed the owner might have taken her pet, but that was one more thing that wasn’t his problem this week.

 

Swinging open the back door, Trevor stepped outside and his jaw almost hit the floor. Scattered across the garden interspersed with rose bushes were dozens of garden gnomes. One was balanced on one foot delicately watering the plants. Another had his shirt off and was flexing with a pair of gardening shears in his hands. Anywhere in the yard he looked he found another gnome. Each one performing some unique activity or pose, Trevor wondered where she could have even gotten all of them from. “Did she have all of these custom made? She must have more money than she knows what to do with.” Looking down at the gnomes in his hands he thought it only fitting they join their friends outside. “Sorry gentleman but there is no way you creepy fellas are spending the week in the house with me. Hang out with your friend for a while.” With a light thud he dropped them down into the closest bed of mulch.

 

Trevor returned into the house satisfied that he had rid himself of the unsightly gnomes. They didn’t warrant another thought as he lounged about the house. He briefly glanced at the detailed list of instructions as he passed by, but figured what was the harm in skipping one day. Who would know after all? The rest of the day went by peacefully for Trevor. Night quickly set in and he found his way back to the bedroom. Taking a look around the room he checked again for any last gnomes hiding out he might have missed. The thought of waking up to their eerie expressions made him shudder. Luckily for Trevor his last cursory check of the bedroom turned up no more gnomes. Feeling satisfied he hurled himself into the giant king bed waiting to drift off to sleep.

 

While Trevor found the bed quiet and relaxing, he couldn’t get to sleep. The old house was filled with creaks and pops that kept him awake. Every time he would start to drift off a strange new noise would spring his eyes wide open. The final straw was when he heard soft footsteps coming from the kitchen. Throwing off the covers he grabbed a flashlight to investigate. Walking toward the kitchen he realized how stupid it was to have left the pet door open. “Please don’t let some wild raccoon have made its way in.” he said to himself preparing for the worst. To his surprise, panning around the kitchen with the flashlight, nothing looked out of place. The longer he looked around the more he started to think he had just been hearing things.



As Trevor turned to leave the kitchen his flashlight revealed a set of eyes gleaming back at him. Shouting at the top of his lungs he threw the flashlight up into the air, letting it fall clattering to the kitchen tile. Leaping two steps backwards Trevor waited motionless while the flashlight rolled to a stop on the ground shining on yet another gnome statue sitting on the counter. The pudgy gnome wearing a chef's outfit holding a rolling pin and beaming back a smile at him. Trevor shifted around uneasily feeling like the gnome's blue eyes following him. “Are you kidding me?! How did I miss another one of these hideous things? This woman has absolutely no taste.” Snatching the gnome off the counter Trevor opened up the back door hurling the statue into the bushes. Once again, feeling confident and relieved that he had rid himself of the gnome statues he went back to be finally able to get some sleep.



While Trevor managed to sleep through the night it wasn’t particularly restful after his encounter with the gnome. Getting out of bed the thought crossed his mind that he wasn’t getting paid enough for this. With that thought cemented in his mind he set out around the house looking to scavenge for anything that the owner might not miss. “What’s a blind woman going to see missing anyway” he said, chuckling to himself. *Speaking of which, I should make sure I didn’t break that ugly chef gnome last night.*

 

On his way to the backdoor he rifled through a number of draws and closets. To his disappointment the only thing he found were a few pieces of gold jewelry that had been laying out on her jewelry box. Patting the bonus he had just stuffed in his pocket he opened the backdoor to check on the statue. After one quick glimpse outside he immediately slammed the door shut. Awaiting him outside all the gnomes had been moved and repositioned gathering at the door to greet him.

 

Panic raced through his mind at the thought of the gnomes out for revenge, but in an instant, he calmed his mind back down. *Don’t be stupid it’s just some dumb prank by the neighborhood kids. Really, it's sad they couldn’t come up with anything clever.* Just thinking about how long it would take to move all the gnomes back tired Trevor out. Deciding not to let it ruin his day he went back to sit on the couch scrolling through his phone instead. Right as he began to settle in he heard a strange noise coming from the kitchen. It was the sound of something plastic swishing around accompanied by a soft click. Trevor’s eyes opened wide, realizing it was the sound of the pet door he forgot to close yet again.

 

Storming into the kitchen Trevor felt annoyed and ready to confront whatever pest had snuck into the house. “Well if she didn’t have any pests before, she has them now.” Stepping into the kitchen he could see the flap of the pet door swinging shut, letting him know that he was a second to late. He dashed for the back door angrily chasing down the kitchen invader. Bursting out of the kitchen the back door rebounded off the house crashing shut behind him. The loud slam of the door didn’t bother him at all. It was the distinctive click of the backdoor locking that caught his attention.

 

Trevor turned around tugging at the locked door in vain. His mind went into a full panic, immediately forgetting about the chase. The thought he had locked himself out pushed everything else out of his head. His thoughts now tightly focused on recalling if he had locked the front door today, and what would happen if he couldn’t get back inside. Had Trevor not been distracted he would have been far more concerned where all of the gnome statues had disappeared to. No longer waiting at the backdoor to greet him, the yard now looked picturesque lined with rose bushes. Before his brain could register what was wrong he scrambled around to the front of the house. Standing confronted by the front door Trevor took in a deep breath praying that he had left the door unlocked. His hand wrapped around the nob and to a welcomed surprise the door creaked open. He couldn’t believe his laziness had paid off for once. The stress and tension he had been holding melted away and Trevor heaved a sigh of relief walking back inside.

 

His relief only lasted a moment feeling his food snag something on the ground. Lurching forward he tried to get his other foot under him, but it collided with something hard sending a throbbing pain through his foot. Unable to catch his balance he slammed against the hardwood floor. Gasping for air he looked back to see a gnome statue planted in the middle of the floor. Its arms spread wide with a devilish grin on his face. Dragging himself away from the creepy statue he was shocked to find four more statues in front of him.

“What the he…”

Before Trevor could get the words out of his mouth there was a thunderous crash on the floor. A bag of flour landed perilously close to his head exploding against the ground. The white pounder flew out in all directions coating Trevor from head to toe. Trevor’s eyes began to water trying to flush out the flour, but it was no use against the thick fog. Blinded by the flour confusion and panic returned. The feelings worsened hearing the clattering of small footsteps surrounding him.



Swinging his arms around in a panic he floundered like a fish out of water. Flailing around on the floor his hand collided with something fleshy and squishy. Trevor didn’t think about what to do next, reflexively grabbing onto what he had found. It proved to be a painful mistake, feeling a set of teeth clamp down on his hand. Crying out in pain Trevor swung his arms around stronger in a wild fury. The mouth unlatched from his hand, but his problems only worsened. Voices shouted out swirling around him.

“Hold him down!”

“Gouge his eyes out!”

“Bite him again!”

“Kick im lads!”

A torrent of blows rained down on Trevor following up on the menacing shouts. Sharp prods and kicks pelted him from all sides as he desperately tried to cover his head. Small hands grabbed at his arms trying to pry them away from his face. Fueled by adrenaline Trevor launched himself back up to his feet, spinning like a whirlwind. His chaotic attack repelled the onslaught but disoriented him in the process. Dizzy and blinded by the flour he lost track of his surroundings.



A barrage of small objects began to rain down on him from all sides. Taking no time to get his bearings, all he could do was pick a direction and run. He only made it a few steps before something latched onto his leg. Trying to shake his leg free as he ran he smashed it into a bookcase, almost tumbling him back to the ground. By some miracle he regained his footing just in time to collide face first into a wall. Finding the wall turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Feeling with his hand along the wall he searched out the first room he could find to get away from his attackers. 

 

Ducking into the first room he found Trevor quickly slammed the door shut leaning up against it. Wasting no time, he wiped at his watering eyes brushing the caked-on flour out of them. Through his blurry vision he saw that he made it back to the master bedroom. As his vision cleared he could finally make out the object that had wrapped itself around  his leg. A terrifying gnome statue with a hideous expression had its arms firmly wrapped around his leg. Trevor readied himself to smash the statue, but a pounding at the bedroom door demanded his attention.

 

Fumbling at the doorknob Trevor raced to lock the door. The pounding at the door turned into loud crashes shaking the door its frame. Slinking away from the door Trevor looked around the room grasping at what to do next. The bedroom window caught his attention and Trevor ran over, throwing open the curtains. Peeking his head cautiously above the windowsill he looked out into the empty yard. Making a breakout the window seemed to be his best chance at a getaway.



Gripping at the window he tried desperately to pull it open only to find it wouldn’t budge. On closer inspection he could see the window had been sloppily painted shut which only spurred on his desperation. Contorting his body, he tried to position himself under the window lifting with his body. His face turned red from exertion, pushing with all his might to free the window. With his head positioned toward the ceiling he noticed the horrifying sight of a small gnome diving off the nearby bookshelf towards his face. The moment Trevor laid eyes on the gnome its pale skin crackled, turning into stone.

 

Trevor screamed out watching the now stone statue plummet down towards his face. Time seemed to slow as he struggled to get his hands up to protect his face, but they got caught fumbling on the window. The statue collided with Trevor’s head dropping him to the ground. Blood poured over his face obscuring his vision once again. Trevor wobbled to his hands and knees fighting through the splitting pain in his head to get back up. Repositioning his leg under him felt surprisingly easier than he expected. His heart raced into overdrive realizing the gnome statue was no longer stuck to his leg. He wondered where the gnome had gotten off to, but shuddered at the thought it wouldn’t be longer before he found out.

 

Back on his feet Trevor wildly swung and kicked his arms and legs trying to keep his attackers at bay. A loud click and creak from the master bedroom door let him know they were nowhere near him. The two gnomes had worked together stacking on top one another to reopen the bedroom door, letting in the flood of gnomes pounding at the door. Gnomes poured through the wide open door each armed with kitchen implements as weapons.

 

The onslaught of shout began again as the gnomes pushed one another racing to attack Trevor. Forming a circle around Trevor the gnomes quickly went to work stabbing at his arms and legs crumpling him back to the ground. With fervor and sadistic glee, the gnomes danced around him taking swings until Trevor lay on the ground motionless. The dancing and merriment continued well after Trevor’s expiration until one of the gnomes loudly clapped his hands together.

“It’s time to get this place cleaned up!”

Moving in precise coordination, the gnomes broke up into teams going to work. Several of them started rifling through Trevor’s pockets taking back the stolen goods, returning them back around the house. The next group strung a rope around the body dragging it out of the house while another team set up to clean the blood-soaked floor. Waiting outside gnomes were standing by with shovels and a pre dug hole waiting to drop the body in. The body was unceremoniously rolled into the hole without hesitation or thought, buried next to the rose bushes. Once the deed was done the gnomes hurried back to their respective places as if nothing had happened.

\*

A few days later the old woman returned home exhausted but satisfied from her long week away. Stepping inside the house the fragrances of fresh roses wafted through the air she would have never guessed the violence just days before. Setting her bag down at the door she walked into the living room, collapsing into her chair.

“Welcome home”, a small voice chimed up at her.

“How did Trevor do taking care of the house”

The gnome beside the chair rubbed at his face, “I’ve told you we can handle things here on our own. That kid made a mess of the palace, but we got it cleaned up for you. He was so clueless he scribbled down a thank you note before he left.”

“Be here in an hour. Don’t make me wait.”

Cocky. Direct. I felt a flutter low in my belly. He always knew how to pull me in. I bit my lip, excitement and nerves mixing as I typed back:

“Better be worth it.”

But I already knew he would be.

The Preparation
I stepped into the shower, the hot water cascading over me, and my thoughts drifted to him—his rough hands, his demanding lips, his weight pressing me into the bed. My fingers grazed my neck, then lower. By the time I was out, my skin was flushed, and not from the heat.

The dress was black, skin-tight, clinging to every curve. Underneath? Black lace panties and a matching bra that barely contained me. My body hummed in anticipation as I slipped on my heels, my legs looking longer, more dangerous. A spritz of perfume, and I was ready.

The Arrival
When I got to his place, he was already waiting. His shirt hung loose, giving me a peek of his chest, and the look in his eyes? Predatory. He didn’t speak at first, just stared, like I was something he wanted to devour.

“Took you long enough,” he said, his voice low and rough.

“I like to keep you waiting,” I teased, brushing past him. But before I could take another step, he grabbed my wrist, spinning me into his chest.

“You look like trouble,” he murmured, his lips so close to mine I could feel his breath.

“And you like trouble,” I shot back, smirking.

His lips crushed against mine, hot and demanding, his hands already exploring my curves. My lipstick smeared, my lips swollen from his kisses. He lifted me effortlessly, and my legs wrapped around his waist.

The Bedroom
The door slammed shut behind us. He tossed me onto the bed, his weight pressing me into the mattress. My dress was gone in seconds, his hands gripping my thighs, spreading me wide. His mouth found my neck, my collarbone, the swell of my breasts.

When he finally slid inside me, I gasped, my nails digging into his back. He was thick, hard, stretching me in ways that left me breathless. I moaned his name, the sound raw and needy, and he groaned in response, his hips thrusting deeper, harder. The friction was unbearable, delicious, driving me wild.

“Fuck, you feel so good,” he growled, his voice strained.

I could barely form words, the pleasure overwhelming. The way he filled me, hitting every spot, had me trembling beneath him. My thighs shook, my back arched, and when he reached down to rub my swollen clit, I shattered, screaming his name.

The Aftermath
Hours later, the room was a wreck. Wet sheets clung to our bodies, the scent of sex thick in the air. My lips were swollen, my throat sore from moaning, screaming, begging. My pussy throbbed, tender and swollen from his relentless thrusts.

He pulled me into his arms, his lips brushing against my ear.

“You’re trouble,” he murmured, his voice soft now, teasing.

“And you love it,” I whispered, smiling against his chest.

I drifted off in his arms, blissfully sore, my body humming from the memories of his touch. That Sunday wasn’t just naughty—it was everything.

I've read from this sub that there's a lot of restriction during working hours. I mean restriction in terms of going to restroom, taking your short break and others. Other than that, there are times you have to pick up call nonstop.

I'm thinking about finding more money to support myself, but on the same time, I don't want to sacrifice my freedom of working. I don't want to feel restricted and feels like I'm a robot instead of a human.

I'm considering moving to downtown Toronto into a 2-3 bedroom condo with my golden retriever next summer/fall. 

My budget is around $3300 + utilities. 

I'm looking for a condo building with a doggy area for running/playing, pool, gym, grocery stores, coffee shop, access to public transport, etc.

I am open to being/keen on something near Union or Financial District.  

My main goal is having a waterfront view/beach view. 

I know that the Sugar Wharf condos are quite popular and I like what they offer too, but the layout of the condos are very odd. Triangular, weirdly shaped kind. 

I'm aware that condos in downtown are very shoe boxy in general but I've seen some great ones that are larger, wider, but don't offer the amenities im looking for or the view. 


I'd be grateful if someone could offer their insight and advice on condo buildings that offer the above criteria as well as safety as I'm a young woman and will be out and about when it's dark due to my working hours. 

Thank you!

Alex had been formulating a hypothesis about Eleya. Originally, he thought that she had a drinking problem. Before the whole clusterfuck with Sharadi, Sergeant Zenshen confirmed that alcoholism also affected the Tsla’o, her own father included in that count. Surprising no one, it had experienced a sharp increase after the cataclysm as more products had returned to the market. Having attended a few social functions with the Empress had allowed him to refine that.

“I believe he mentioned that he has a brother once, yes!” Eleya was practically beaming at this confirmation. She had seen when she picked his brain against his will, but it had actually been brought up in conversation after the whole thing with Sharadi. “Though he has not told me anything about him.”

She appeared to drink a lot at formal dinners. As with everything Eleya did in view of the public, and particularly the political class, there was some sleight of hand involved. She *appeared* to, but she did not. The wine glass she used at these functions was different. It filled too quickly and a handful of sips emptied it. So while it looked like she was hitting the wine pretty hard, having three or four glasses at a meal, he was quite sure at this point that she never even drank a whole serving. It was a layer of illusion for her to play with.

He wasn’t sure what the illusion was supposed to be, and Carbon didn’t know when he asked about it. She had suggested that it may just be to imply that she was able to tolerate a lot of alcohol, or that the less informed might be tempted to try and put something over on her while they think she’s slightly inebriated. Maybe both. 

“Yes, Peter is his older brother.” Audry looked to Carbon, trying to figure out *why* this was a big deal to Eleya. “He’s married already, and has a son of his own.”

Carbon shook her head. She had no idea what her aunt was on about, either.

Alex couldn’t speak to Eleya’s alcohol consumption when alone, but when it was just family, she actually did drink. Actual glasses of wine. Those sour citrus mixed drinks she liked, or just a lowball of liquor, neat. He wouldn’t call it excessive drinking, exactly, but it tended to be heavy. It appeared to relax her, eased back the carefully built façade for a time. Her words came more quickly, less carefully considered. Carbon had said it reminded her of when they were younger, before Navaren had been assassinated and she had taken up the role of Sovereign alone.

Alex surmised that the root of Eleya’s behavior was that she wanted to have a family again. While she hadn’t explicitly said this, all her actions pointed to it. She risked a lot, possibly *everything* up to and including the Empire, vetting Alex and bringing him into the fold just to appease Carbon. He could have easily turned that introductory assault into something that withdrew Human aid from them, if not that kicked off that hot war that she wanted to avoid. Alex believed that she wanted to be able to shrug off her duties, sit around a table and enjoy being with people she cared about, who cared about her. The main problem there was that after decades of gripping the reins of the Empire by herself, the only way she could manage that now was to be in an altered state of mind.

Eleya clearly considered this dinner to be one of those times where she wanted that. In this quiet moment, she was sitting here with her niece, nephew, and the closest thing Carbon had to a mother now. This was a family dinner, even including the stranger Alex brought along.

They hadn’t even ordered food and she just finished that Titan Tea, setting the empty pint glass down on the coaster with a thump. “Good, good. What does he do? Is he also a Pilot?”

His new, refined theory? Getting slightly drunk surrounded by the people she trusted implicitly was the closest she could get to being vulnerable with them. The only way she could feel close to someone anymore.

“No, Peter is an architect. He’s been with his company for about a decade now, right out of college.” Audry was obviously proud of Pete’s accomplishments, and rightly so. He had busted his ass to excel and the owner of the company recognized that.

“Is it so?” The gears behind Eleya’s slightly glazed eyes turned, antenna lifting just a little bit as she schemed. “A creator with a young family and devotion to a cause. Yes... That is very good.”

The table drew silent, no one sure what to make of that comment. Carbon turned to Audry, interested in moving the conversation somewhere else. “I have been negligent in my inquiry today. How are Peter and his family doing?”

“They’re doing well. Gaspari is gearing up for a new project and he’s stressed about that, but that’s just how Peter is. The bigger the venture, the more it weighs on him. He was like that all through school.” She took a sip of her Last Word, the drink barely touched compared to Eleya’s. “Jason’s going to be starting pre-k soon, he’s actually excited about it.”

“I am pleased to know that.” Carbon bowed a little bit. She had a tendency to swing towards more formal as Eleya became more drunk. “Next time you see them, would you send our regards and be sure that they are still at ease about the accident with Jason. I know he had no ill intentions.”

In that moment where Carbon and Audry spoke to each other so easily, Eleya looked like she was in pain. It was brief - even getting drunk she had impressive control over herself - but there was a moment of sorrow clear in her eyes. The relationship she had given up and so desperately wanted back, right there in front of her.

Alex felt bad for her, but she had dug that hole herself. At least 30 years down the line, she was starting to fill it back in.

“What is this accident? Who is Jason?” Eleya inquired.

“Jason is Pete’s son. He got over excited and came running at Carbon as fast as he could to hug her. You might say running into things is a bit of a family trait.” Alex was very mindful to not mention that Jason unintentionally and very enthusiastically dropped a slur. Nobody expected a four year old to be a diplomat.

“Who is Pete?” She asked immediately after he got done speaking.

Oh yeah, Tsla’o didn’t really do nicknames the same way. “That’s just a short way of saying Peter.”

“Ah. It is only one letter shorter?” She puzzled that out, shaking her head slowly until she noticed the waiter, Derek, return. She *clapped* at him. “Server. This drink is empty, I require another one immediately.”

The reactions to this varied significantly around the table. Ed was about to start dying, hiding a barely restrained smirk behind his pint. Alex sucked in a breath through his teeth and he was pretty sure Carbon did the same. Audry was shocked, which was fair. No one really expects that sort of behavior, particularly when the person doing it hadn't seemed so petty.

Alex wasn’t going to let that slide. “Hey, we don’t do that here.” You could tell a lot about someone based on how they treated waitstaff. Normally Eleya didn’t order anyone around like that. Normally she didn’t drink like this around people. 

“*You* do not do that.” She chose obstinate as the way to respond. Great. Drunk Eleya was getting downgraded from pitiable to annoying right this very second. 

“*We* do not.” All right. Picking a Royal We fight with the Empress was probably not the best idea in the world, but he had some protection on his side. A lot of her plans had him as a central component now, and he could not be easily replaced for several of them. Carbon was within striking range, as well. In less violent options, Eleya’s insistence that Alex pay attention to things he didn’t care about had taught him a few things about *her*. “Is that the example you set for your people? For those who may someday take your place? Clapping at a professional who is clearly working alone, to get a drink a little faster?”

Invoking leadership was something she did all the time, and the Tsla’o took the chain of command very seriously. Alex framed himself as the subordinate in this case, which he was as the Crown Prince. Making her look at plainly disrespectful behavior over something as petty as getting a refill, from a different point of view. Coercing her military background into the picture. Asking her if this is really how she wants him to treat random Tsla’o when he wants something, without saying it directly.

It was unsettling that he felt like he was channeling Eleya when he said all that, though.

Eleya glanced up at his ears where the piercings marking his station would normally reside as she thought that over, slowly rubbing her teeth together. “No. Perhaps not. You are wise beyond your years, Pilot. Your council is appreciated.” 

She turned to Derek, giving him a shallow bow. “I beg your forgiveness. My behavior was needlessly rude, unfitting of my station and your dignity alike.”

Derek was caught off guard. The situation had turned on a dime, and he was clearly not used to belligerent people coming around so fast. He looked to Alex, who was trying to get him to bow in pantomime. Derek picked that up and returned the bow. “Thank you, you have my forgiveness.”

Alex gave him a discreet thumbs up. Perfect.

Derek was also ready to get this behind him. “Are you all ready to order?”

Turns out they were. Alex and Ed both went for the double bacon cheeseburger. Classic, couldn’t go wrong with it. Audry had been about to order the Irish stew when they both jumped to warn her this place was Irish pub *themed*. She got a cheeseburger as well. Carbon tentatively asked if it was possible to get the ribeye, rare, from *Gardien de Phare* as they were not actually in Noonan’s. Turns out it was possible. Eleya ordered what Carbon was having, and another Titan Tea.

“Hey, maybe you’d like to try some other Human specialties while you’re here.” Eleya with a few drinks was fine. Eleya with half a pint of spirits after who knows how much champagne was already annoying and it probably hadn't even hit yet. “Maybe a Shirley Temple? It's got several kinds of fruit. Centuries old recipe, as well.”

Another little bit of manipulation he’d learned from Eleya. She did actually like old things. History interested her. It was baby steps compared to what she did, but it was effective.

She looked from Alex to Derek. “Is this so?”

Derek nodded. “I would say that is an accurate assessment. It is a very old recipe, and makes effective use of grenadine, cherry, and citrus to produce a bright, effervescent drink.”

“Cherry is like *tamaks*, they are both a sweet pit-fruit.” Carbon added, intuiting what Alex was doing.

“Very well, I will try that.” She relented, and Derek departed with their order.

Eleya turned her attention to Audry again, getting back to their original conversation. “This Jason, he is a small child? Four years, was it?”

Alex excused himself to use the restroom.

Not that he was going to use the restroom, he just wanted to talk to their waiter. He dipped out the service door, the room beyond it actually nearly as large as the dining room itself. Suppose they might be staging food for dozens of people sometimes.

The security crew inside stopped talking and turned to look at him as one, which was impressive for two separate groups who had never met before. He couldn’t be sure but it sounded like they had been discussing their issued equipment before his trespass had been noticed. “Hey, uh, did you guys see the waiter? I need to talk to him.”

The closest DSS suit jerked his head towards the back door. “Down the hall, left is the kitchen, right is the service bar. If you leave the secured area, we will have to scan you on the way back in.”

“Alright, I can dig that.” Derek had just taken orders, so the kitchen would probably be the first stop. Alex went left, peeking in the window on the swinging doors. Busy, but no waiter in sight. He turned around and nearly ran straight into the guy coming back from the service bar. “Ah hey. I just wanted to apologize for that scene. She doesn’t get out a lot.”

Derek once again looked surprised. “Accepted. I must say, it was very mild even before her apology. Diplomats tend to think extremely highly of themselves and it comes out in some interesting ways, and they do not reverse course so readily.”

“That’s- Sorry to hear that. Just, whatever she orders from now on, get her an alcohol free version of it?” That was the real reason he was back here. Keeping Eleya from getting more drunk. “And could we get an appetizer platter? Biggest one they can make.”

“Will do. Anything else?” He was the definition of professional about all this.

“Yeah, can I give you my card and get this paid for without bringing the check out?” They couldn’t be spending *that* much, and he had hardly bought anything since he got back.

“DSS has it expensed already.”

“Oh, shit. Okay. Well, I’ll stop holding you up then, thank you.” Alex stepped out of Derek’s way with a shallow bow and headed back up the hallway. Apparently he was going to continue not buying anything.

Scans only took a couple of seconds, even with both teams doing their own.

While he had been gone for only a few minutes, the conversation had moved on to Ed. “No, you’re right. My background isn’t too different from Alex’s, with a few notable exceptions. All my runs in the Scout program ended with very little fanfare. I do have one planet being terraformed under my belt, but that’s the big one. Otherwise it’s lots of natural resources and a couple of interesting gas giants.”

“And you have spent fifteen years engaged in training the next generations of Pilots after that?” Eleya had leaned in, resting her chin on her knuckles as she dug into what Ed had been getting up to until now, bright blue eyes alight with interest despite looking a little more drunk than before. “It may be forward of me to ask - and I understand that this question is more appropriately taken to those in control of the program as a whole, I am merely gauging your interest at this moment - would you be willing to impart some of this experience unto the Tsla’o Empire? Even with the expedition cut short, the yields exceeded our usual exploration returns.”

“I don’t-” He stopped talking as Derek returned, dispensing a platter of fried food to the table and a glass of vibrant red liquid for Eleya. Sharp gray eyes tracking their waiter until he was out of sight again. “I don’t mind the idea at all. I’m biased, of course, but I find the program to be a good use of money - both in material returns and as a testbed for technology. I do have a trainee right now that I would prefer to see to the end of their course first, but this doesn’t sound like something that will be set up overnight anyway.”

“No, bureaucracy moves at its own pace.” Eleya tried her Shirley Temple, giving it a curious look that turned into a sidelong glance aimed at Alex. Obviously not drunk enough to miss the lack of alcohol. “I will see to opening channels about another partnership. Even without such deals brokered, if you have time available, I bid you to visit *The Sword of the Morning Light* and tour our training facilities. They are aimed more at maintaining and improving skills rather than teaching, but wise words are always appreciated.”

As he perused the selection of deep fried goods in the middle of the table, Alex wondered how he would *covertly* notify someone that if they got their hardware upgraded, the ONI would absolutely be fucking with it. Not just blurting it out like he wanted to do right now. “Don’t spend too much time over there or Section Seven is gonna poach you too.”

“Yeah, they can try if they want to make an actual enemy out of the CPP. It’s tolerated when they rustle a pilot every now and then, but I am in way too deep. I’ve seen Admirals sweat when I talk about retirement.” He reached out and plucked a fried ravioli off the plate, not talking while he eats it. Always was a stickler for not talking with his mouth full. “I would actually very much like to see your ship and facilities. Alex seems no worse for wear from his time in your care, and I’ve heard generally good things coming from friends in the Trailblazer community.”

No worse for wear. Alex did not laugh at that, knowing it would have been sarcastic and strained. A couple of meetings with a therapist did not undo multiple near death experiences, or any of the manifold other things he had been working on. He just let them talk and pointed out the crab rangoons to Carbon. She was aware of crab and the other large sea bugs that forest spider reminded him of, but hadn’t had a chance to try yet. He went for the mozzarella sticks. Nostalgic, more than anything. Hadn’t had one of those since he was a kid.

It was good, it just didn’t land the same as an adult.

“I will formally extend an invitation when we return to the ship.” She nodded once, the statement made and to be carried out with the authority of the Empress. “I assume the young Pilot will be able to assist me in spelling your name correctly, I suspect it does not translate well to Tsla.”

Everybody had a chuckle at that except Carbon, now stuck between rigid formality and curiosity about the little packet of fried food Alex had indicated she should try.

“Even if he couldn’t, I’m the only Edwin in the CPP training department so it won’t be hard to track me down.” He gave her an affable smile and went for another ravioli.

“Speaking of visiting places... I was recently invited along to Na’o, the Tsla’o home system. Carbon is meeting with the first class of *Lan* to graduate since the Cataclysm, and not a lot of Humans have had the opportunity to visit there as guests.” By his estimation it was zero. No Human had actually ever been allowed into Tsla’o space without a specific reason, and he wasn’t actually an outlier here. He was doing Prince stuff, like escorting prisoners. “Just a quick trip. With transit time back and forth there’s enough time for a few days there before we have to be back in Sol for other ongoing business.”

“I expect pictures.” His mother took that pretty well, all things considered. The idea of Alex jetting off to distant parts of the galaxy *was* old hat to her now. “Maybe a new mug.”

They both got a laugh out of that, no one else at the table privy to the fact that Alex had been buying his parents novelty tourist mugs from pretty much every place he had gone to off Earth. Having a souvenir from the seat of an alien Empire would be one of those things you trot out whenever the annoying neighbors start boasting about having been all the way out to New Austin or something. There would be no way to top it. 

“At least a keychain, if I can find one.” That actually got him wondering... He looked to Carbon, just now tentatively biting into that crab rangoon. He was not going to interrupt his wife while she was eating. Eleya was still perusing the options, so he aimed the question at her. “Do the Tsla’o have souvenirs? Like keepsakes or mementos from places that have been visited?”

“Yes, though it is often less functional than a mug. Small art pieces, usually reflecting the local culture in some way, were the most common.” She settled on a fried ravioli, inspecting it as she continued. “Telucten, the province I am from, was known for its livestock and used a sleeping *Rakaro* as the base for its traditional memento. Pictures, paintings, carvings, little stuffed toys for children. I am sure it would be easy enough to find an artisan interested in ceramics to make something specific.”

Having something custom made kind of defeated the purpose of the souvenir mug, but he would certainly ask for some kind of visual pun. A joke that was incomprehensible to a Human would actually fit the novelty mug genre perfectly, at least. “I’ll be sure to ask around once we’re in the area.”

“I can put you in contact with a few people.” She popped the little fried square into her mouth and seemed to enjoy it.

“Thanks.” He would still ask around.

The conversation stayed light as the appetizers disappeared. Three of the people at the table were aware of the full level of the deceit being engaged in at the moment, a fourth just keeping the fact Alex and Carbon were married on the low for now. Ed was completely unaware of anything other than them not being able to discuss the ongoing work with the Confederation.

Eleya got the full explanation of what a research librarian was, which as it turned out was close to what they called Conservators. A librarian with specialized knowledge or experience. This was also met with earnest approval by the Empress. There were dozens of Conservators in the employ of the royal court, though much of their work now focused on restoration. The palace library had been fully destroyed in the Cataclysm, and many other libraries that survived are not expected to be evacuated until they’ve run out of living survivors, which probably meant they’d be considering digging them out of collapsed cities in fifty years. 

A bit of a downer to reach as dinner arrived. Eleya ordered a Last Word as she had finished the Shirley Temple.

“This is from a cow, correct?” Eleya inspected a slice of ribeye stuck on the end of her fork, pink through the middle and still dripping juice. “It is a larger livestock animal?”

“Yeah, I think some of them get up to like a thousand kilos. Most are probably not that big.” Alex was entirely unfamiliar with the process of raising cattle and the exact details of such, but he had written a report on cows in grade school. 

“A thousand...” Her eyes widened slightly, looking back down at the slab of grilled meat otherwise untouched. “That is enormous. More than five *Rakaro*. Do they serve any other purpose aside from being used for meat?”

That third grade report was getting a workout today. “Used to be used to pull carts or plows, they produce milk, hides can be tanned for leather... Those are the biggest traditional uses, at least.”

“Very similar in use to the *Rakaro*, just massive.” She popped the slice of beef into her mouth and savored it. “Quite a lot of fat, too. What an interesting creature.”

“The fat striations - it is referred to as marbling - create a flavor profile that is generally not found in Tsla’o cuisine.” Carbon was a third done with her steak already. While she was speaking in a very formal cadence right now, she was not waiting to finish eating before she started sharing this with Eleya. 

“So it is. We will have to revisit this at some time, I suspect the chefs will find many interesting uses for it.” Eleya seemed just as sold on beef as Carbon.

“Correct me if I’m wrong, but this is the first time you’ve had Human food?” Alex was almost certain that was a yes.

“It is. I leaned on Carbon’s knowledge of your cuisines, and she has certainly lead me down an agreeable path.”

“Everything we had from *Gardien* while in debrief was excellent.” It was, but it wasn’t Alex’s sort of thing. Too fancy. This time the steaks came with broccolini and truffled gnocchi. He wasn’t even sure what broccolini actually was. 

His burger had garlic fries on the side. That was perfect for him. It was familiar and comfortable and still made him feel homesick even though they had never had garlic fries at home.

“Wish they would have put me in the diplomatic suites for debrief at least once.” Ed grumbled into his burger. There was still mirth crinkling the corners of his eyes, the complaint all in fun.

“Careful what you ask for.” Alex shot back with a chuckle. Getting sent up there was a security thing, and had come after a week in quarantine. He wouldn’t say that exactly balanced out.

The conversation hit a lull there, everyone eating in silence. It was strange. Normally, any combination of this group would be fairly talkative. Things had changed a lot in the last few months.

It would have been nice if his dad had come along, even though the trip originally started as a girls day out. It would have just left him sitting around most of the day or acting as a third wheel, both of which Alex knew he didn’t particularly like. There would be other times, other meals shared. He’d see to that. 

Ambrose also had a ton of stories to tell that didn’t involve things that they were keeping secret as well, which would have been nice right now. Everything Alex could think of to talk about inevitably had to be heavily censored or simply not spoken of. Carbon was in the same boat and frankly he was a little worried about what Eleya would say if he tried to get her to keep talking about something. Audry loved engaging people in *conversations*, but usually shied away from just talking. Ed, on the other hand... “Hey, Ed. I am reasonably sure no one else at the table has heard about the *Easy-E*.”

He held up a finger, hands still gripping his burger as he was mid-bite. This was his favorite story. “Ok, ok. My first outing was on an original first generation Scoutship, right? The last one that was in service, the *Ernest Shackleton*. It was named before they started letting Pilots name them, they were on this kick of explorers who hadn’t killed a bunch of people with disease and war. Shackleton was perfect for that, absolute legend for what he went through to keep his crew alive. Keep that in mind. It had the nickname *Easy-E*, because it was not easy to work with at all. Fully and intentionally ironic, nothing ever worked exactly right...”

That got them through dinner. Ed’s bombastic retelling of the various things that plagued his first expedition and how close they had gotten to having to request a recovery on the ship was actually pretty entertaining. Alex was sure he was embellishing it a little bit, but all of it felt reasonable. He had just gotten to the point where the primary sensor bus caught fire while on approach to an F-type main sequence star when dessert arrived.

Apple pie à la mode. It didn’t really make sense for Noonan’s to be a bastion of pies, but somebody in the kitchen absolutely knocked it out of the park every time.

By the time Alex was done with his coffee, Ed and Vikas, his engineer, were limping the *Easy-E* home at a quarter of maximum speed to keep the Waveride array from collapsing itself.

“It was great seeing you guys again.” He hugged his mom tightly, and gave Ed a slap on the back. “When we get back from Na’o, I’ll be sure to find some time to catch up, all right?”

“I’ll bother Carbon about it until you do.” His mom smiled, always a troublemaker at heart.

Carbon got a laugh out of that as she leaned in and gave Audry a hug. “I will gladly bother him until he does.”

“See you, man. Take care and have fun, right?” He shook Alex’s hand, and put a little bit of jive on it.

Having fun wasn’t really on the itinerary in Na’o.  “You know I always take care, time will tell about having fun.” 

“It was lovely to make both of your acquaintances.” Eleya bowed to both Audry and Ed, who bowed back. 

His mom held her arms out to Eleya, eyebrows raised, and gestured for her to bring it on in. Audry was perceptive, always had been. If Alex had noticed his aunt-in-law feeling left out once, she had probably seen it three or four times.

There was a moment there where Eleya looked nervous, a brief flicker across her features before it was quashed. She went for the hug.

It was short, of course. A quick squeeze and friendly pat on the shoulder, and they were done. Just like when one of Alex’s regular aunts visited on holidays. Carbon was staring, wide-eyed with surprise the whole time.

DSS escorted Audry and Ed from the dining room, and the trio left gathered their own security agents before heading back down to the hanger. Alex stood between Carbon and her aunt, keeping the pair physically separated. He wasn’t sure if he inserted himself there despite how well things had gone, or because they had gone well and he now expected some sort of fuckery to occur.

“Would you allow me to accompany you back on the Masamune? I assume you will be piloting it, Alex, as we do not have anyone else trained on it.” Eleya spoke softly as they passed through the still-secured halls. “I direct that question to both of you.”

“Fine by me. Carbon?” He had stopped drinking after that one beer, which had been over an hour ago now, specifically because he had intended to fly it back. He also knew that question was actually aimed at Carbon. Mind getting trapped in a wee little can with the aunt you’re on questionable terms with for a few hours?

She actually thought about it, several meters of hallway passing by before she spoke. “I agree, it will be fine.”

“Thank you.” Despite having retained her usual level of self control after the Titan, Eleya sounded surprised. “It was...”

The Empress hesitated there, and then went silent as they approached the hanger. The Royal Guard were still there by the hatch to the GX8, and a little hive of activity fired up as they approached the Tsla’o ships. A gesture told her security team which ship she was taking, all of the guards splitting up as necessary, only the pair in power armor coming into the Masamune with them.

Eleya waited until the hatch was closed before she spoke again. “A moment, please. It was nice to spend time with you both, without the pretense of the court. Thank you. Alex, your mother is a treasure, be sure you treat her as such.” Her voice was still soft and felt as though she was still ruminating on the evening, devoid of the usual imperious tones that she was fond of.

Neither Alex or Carbon had really been prepared for that, exactly. Alex found his reply first, “of course, you’re welcome. I wish we could have been a bit more open about everything, but... Agreed, it was nice.”

“Yes. We are in agreement. I would like to speak as family more.” Carbon was surprised that those words had just come out of her own mouth.

Eleya looked happy. Strange as it was, a smile that appeared genuine and even continued up into her eyes was plastered on her face as she gave them a little bow. “I will be seated. I assume you do not require assistance with handling Human traffic control, young Prince?”

That did get a short chuckle out of him. “Yeah, I got them.” He turned to head up to the flight deck. Should get the thing fired up sooner rather than later. It was a two hour burn.

“Alex, before it slips my mind...” Eleya stopped him with a hand on his arm. She held up her index and middle fingers.  “You owe me two real Human drinks.”

He sighed. Can’t pull one over on a professional drinker. “Fine. You can avail yourself of  the bar on the way back.”

She clicked her tongue. “I will, but I am owed two *mixed* drinks. One of them must be the one your mother had.”

Alex rolled his eyes. Well, the Berkmann could do that easily enough. Just have to figure out what absurd other drink she was going to end up with. It had to have an extensive list. “Alright, I’ll figure it out. In the meantime, I gotta get this ship underway.”

Up the stairs he went, half expecting to hear Carbon follow him. No dice, but he could hear the two of them talking as he slipped into the pilot’s chair. He slid a finger under the row of switches to bring the ship to life, the hum of the engines peaking before settling to a low, distant drone.

He grabbed the headset and pulled it on, the last thing he heard from the cabin being Eleya asking Carbon to sit with her and discuss something long overdue.

Eleya feeling humble, about to get a hard conversation done.

If you aren't already aware of it, what Shackleton did was wild. A documentary about it just came out, well worth a look.

Did not have the time this week to redo Ch. 114 significantly, but I am still working on it.

1gzhest,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gzhest,Unexplained rising RHR and lowering HRV,"Hey.

So the last handful of days/week, my resting heart rate has been climbing higher and higher and my heart rate variability has been going lower and lower. I don’t drink or smoke, I quit coffee 4 days ago (I was only having 100mg of caffeine a day in one single small coffee), I am not poorly or under the weather. There’s zero explanation.
My heart rate won’t go lower than 71 while I’m sleeping, it just wants to remain high. 

I’m at a total loss. Anyone else experienced this? 

(I’ve got a doc apt booked, but already been cleared by cardiology and endocrine)
