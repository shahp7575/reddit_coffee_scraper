Aside from some slight pain while driving, I felt pretty much fine. I got a coffee and ran a quick errand, and went home. I got home, still feeling great and did some light house work, trying to clean my room as its been a little messy since I've been recovering. An hour or two later, my boobs were swelling and starting to hurt, and the pain kept getting worse. It feels like a different kind of pain from when I was first recovering, not as stinging more like burning? They are literally the biggest I think they've been since the surgery. I am currently in bed trying to relax and stay still but it still kinda hurts. I took 3 ibuprofen about 4 hrs ago, I would take one of the pain pills, however after I got home from driving I took about 50 mg of edibles a

couple hours ago and I don't want to mix those.

1qacnxu,https://i.redd.it/iyhrqxe5nscg1.jpeg,My mom’s journey from diagnosis to goodbye,"Thank you to this community that has helped me through months of uncertainty and pain and hope and acceptance. My beautiful, kind, strong, smart and amazing mom left this earth January 2nd.

My mom was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer on July 16.

Her doctor had encouraged her one last trip,so she came to visit us mid September. By then she was still active and you couldn’t tell she was terminale. Once she arrived to the US, her health took a turn for the worse and we had to rush her to the hospital were they told us that the cancer had spread and that she has to be put in hospice. We chose hospice at home. Over the months that followed, her health steadily declined—extreme fatigue, more weight loss, digestive issues, weakness, and increasing sleep. By the final weeks, she had lost the ability to walk on her own and was sleeping most of the day. She was barely drinking, maybe a small bottle of water per day, and eating very little—around 300 calories at most. A week before she passed, she stopped eating entirely.

She began actively transitioning about five days before she passed.

The day before that transition began was striking. She suddenly had a burst of energy. She stood up on her own, asked for coffee, and ate half a madeleine—very French, very her. It felt almost Proustian, like memory surfacing one last time. She sang, talked, and was fully present with us all day. By that night, she slipped into a comatose state.

She was on home hospice, and once she started transitioning, nurses came once a day for about 30 minutes. My sister and I cared for her ourselves around the clock until her final breath. We did everything—changing her, cleaning her, administering morphine and anxiety medication every three hours along with medication to reduce secretions.

Her last bowel movement was two days before she passed, and again shortly before the end. About an hour before she died, the death rattle began, but it was not severe. Turning her head to the side and elevating it helped significantly. We gently cleaned her mouth and managed secretions.

We prayed, held her hands, and told her it was okay to let go—that we would be okay.

When she passed, I felt something profound—not just her body failing, but a clear separation. It was as if her body was only a shell she no longer needed. I sensed her spirit leave, peacefully and unmistakably. What remained was the body, but she was gone. That moment deepened my faith beyond words. It felt like a transition, not an ending.

She looked peaceful afterward, almost smiling.

She took her last breath at the same exact time written on my birth certificate. To me, that felt deeply symbolic, like a closing and an opening at once.

I’m sharing this because this journey makes you question everything and carry deep anticipatory grief.

I hope my mom’s journey helps someone feel a little less afraid of what comes next.

Sending strength and love to all of you 🤍

Here is a chart that proved to be very accurate. As we moved toward the last column, my mom matched more and more of the signs—until, in the final column, she matched them all.",1,1768169305.0,pancreaticcancer,0,1.0,False

Nearly a year in and 20+kg down, more than 20% of my body weight. Just under 25 BMI, but I’m an ethnic minority so would prefer to be under 23. Calculators say BF% is around 28 so could be higher or lower. Fittest I’ve ever been (lots of Pilates 3-5x a week) but still not doing enough cardio! 

I have been in what I call a plateau for 2-3 months. This week I finally went up to a 12.5mg dose after 6 pens worth of 10mg. Now struggling to find a place with a price I’m happier with but I suspect that is because I haven’t purchased that many pens since the price hike. 

I think I’d like to continue for a bit longer and then taper down slowly. Overshoot a little on the weight loss goal as a buffer. 

New Year’s resolution this year has been to eat more protein, which unfortunately has resulted in the purchase of a lot of protein yoghurts and not amazing tracking of food but we press on. Supplementation has been patchy at best, a brief foray into collagen powder in my coffee has not been retained.

All this to say, I am really pleased with how I’ve changed how I exercise, but there is more to do.

I gave up for the second time.   It’s frustrating.

As I step off the bus, head down and avoiding everyone’s gaze, I can’t believe this is happening again.

I could say the worst part of this is the financial loss, but it isn’t. I mean, wasting money sucks since I’m not rich, but the feeling of not being able to do it is the worst.

The feeling of failure.

For the second time, I’ve given up on taking the trip, stepping off the bus when almost everyone else has already boarded, simply because I can’t handle the anxiety.

The idea of spending so much time in that confined environment, close to so many people, makes me feel... I don't even know how to describe it. It’s like having an elephant sitting on my chest.

Dejected, I call a ride-share app to take me back home.

End the live stream, and the first thing I do is let out a tired sigh I’ve been holding in for several minutes. I make sure everything is okay on my channel, then give a long stretch before standing up. I turn off the computer and head to the kitchen.

As I fill a glass with orange juice, I think about the kind messages I receive from people while I’m streaming games. When I’m live on my channel, I split my time between completing game challenges and reading the comments, always doing my best to respond and try to return all the love people send me through short messages. Many nights, while I’m playing and talking, I read messages from people saying how important I am in their lives. I can identify each of them by their profile pictures, and I love all the affection, but this idea that I make a difference in others' lives always hits me hard. I think: if they knew who the guy who entertains their nights really is... would they still like me?

I find myself thinking about how different the character I created on the internet is from my actual self. I finish my juice and decide to go for a walk; it’s almost dusk, and that’s the best time for a stroll.

Before leaving the house, I look at the table, the attractive packaging is there. I turn toward the door, trying to resist, but I give in, reach out, and promise myself these will be the last ones. But... who am I kidding? I’ve barely stepped out of the house and I’m already lighting a cigarette. I decide to leave the lighter at home, convincing myself that it will make it harder to light the next one.

I walk along the sidewalk, and between one puff and another, I enter a reflective state, thinking about how good it feels that someone rarely recognizes me on the street. Partly because I live in a small town where most residents are older and spend their time on crosswords and knitting instead of watching someone play games. But, of course, the fact that I wear a wig, contact lenses, and makeup, becoming a different character in every stream, also helps maintain my anonymity. That’s it: the guy who plays, dresses up as characters, and is super fun, that’s me on the internet. No other detail of my personal life is shared.

I walk faster as it starts to drizzle. My cigarette is almost finished, and I reach into my pocket for the lighter, momentarily forgetting I left it at home. Instead of the lighter, my fingers touch something metallic, and a flood of memories hits me without warning. I take a deep breath and, without giving any other intrusive thought time to take over my mind, I pull another cigarette from the pack and join its tip to the one that is almost finished but still lit.

I finish the second cigarette and put out the stub in an ashtray in front of the one and only, and best, coffee shop in town. I step inside.

Inside, the light has a yellowish tone that gives me a very pleasant sense of comfort. Besides, the chairs are cozy and have made me change my mind and drink my coffee here instead of taking it to-go several times.

I should be friends with some of the people in this shop since I come here often, but making friends has always been difficult for me.

An introvert who can’t even look his interlocutor in the eye couldn't succeed in any other field than a job where I don’t have to face anyone directly.

I go to the counter, and even this minimal social interaction makes my hands sweat.

Damn it.

I order my coffee, staring at the counter, and the girl asks in a gentle voice if it’s ""the usual."" I smile and say yes. In no time, she prepares it and hands me the drink. I thank her, take the cup, and apologize after spilling a few drops on the counter, I think I got clumsy the moment she handed it to me, but she says it’s fine. I briefly lift my head and give my best smile, still apologizing, and head to one of the tables.

I sit down and start drinking the coffee slowly, letting my brain understand that this is the last stimulant it will have tonight. As I enjoy the drink, I look around. There are few people in the shop; it usually peaks earlier when many young people gather here to talk and flirt. I once dared to come here during the busiest hour and bitterly regretted it... When I pulled away from the crowd, panicking because I simply couldn’t handle the social pressure, that’s when she came to talk to me... Vanessa. I still think of that night as both the best and worst of my life. I reach into my pocket again and touch the metallic object there. This time, I let a smile escape. Out of all my coats, did I have to pick this exact one?

Trying to push painful memories out of my mind, I look around once more. At a table near mine, there’s a man in a tie sitting in front of a laptop, looking bored and typing without much enthusiasm. At another, a man in a beanie with his head down eats a croissant and seems to look away when I glance in his direction. A few tables ahead, in a more discreet corner, sits a couple. They are talking in low voices, letting out little giggles, probably laughing at inside jokes and looking at each other lovingly. It’s beautiful to see, and I feel a pang in my heart. Before lowering my head again to stare at my coffee, I have the impression of seeing someone standing outside the shop, both hands in their pockets, looking in. I turn only to see the back of someone walking away quickly. I wonder if it was the same person who was there before, staring inside. I don’t give it much thought, standing still isn't a crime, right?

I finish my coffee, put on my hoodie, and leave.

I live in a quiet neighborhood, in the most remote area I could find. It’s a pleasant house, and the fact that no one can hear me is good because I constantly get excited and talk loudly when I’m live streaming. Plus, it’s nice to be able to listen to music and watch my movies and series at a high volume, knowing for certain that I’m not bothering anyone.

Someone as lonely as I am is constantly looking for ways to fill the silence that takes over this place.

1qacivj,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1qacivj/i_thought_i_had_gotten_away_with_an_easy_puppy/,"I thought I had gotten away with an easy puppy, but hello 7 month old menace!","**I am going to apologize in advance for this long rant lmao but I am slowly losing my mind**. Hoping this is just a stage (I HOPE) but can also use some positivity/advice and know I am not alone.

Background - I got my Chihuahua at 10 weeks old back in September. Chi's are the only breed I've ever had so I am pretty used to their behaviors and traits, but of course each has their own personality. I struck gold in terms of demeanor - he loves all people, all dogs any size, has never growled/shown aggression in any circumstance and even loves going to the vet. I worked at a dog daycare and then as a vet tech through college and that has helped, but to a point of course.

He has just hit 7 months old and new behaviors are forming that are sending me into insanity. It's just a few things that are not overly serious but I have no clue if what I am doing to solve them are correct and I don't want him to regress into negative behaviors because he truly is such a good dog, and I don't want to be the one that causes him to resent me or turn into a 'bad dog'.

One of his new teenager traits is when he gets high reward chews, he will hide them. That doesn't bother me; I know his hiding spots and he will go retrieve them when he is ready to chew on them for a bit. But, now he is hiding them, and coming back to the couch, and then digging to the point of destroying the fabric as if there is a lost chew that fell through couch cushions. I will take the cushions off and make sure to show him that there is nothing there. I put the couch cushions back on and bam, digging at the same spot where there is NOTHING. I have tried telling him no/stop and direct him to where he hid the chew, but he comes back to digging the couch. He's at the age where no and stop are just not phasing him. This is the point, after probably 20 minutes, I gently lose it and say DUDE ITS NOT THERE and then I feel bad for getting frustrated but it is so incessant its incredibly annoying. I genuinely think he is trying to make me think he lost it so I just keep giving him more, which I don't.

I have no choice but to put him in his crate, which is always freely open all day and he will nap in there, but I hate that I feel recently, I am needing to crate him to force him to stop the bad behavior. The last thing I want to do is use the crate as a punishment and I know that's not what it should be for and don't want that safe space to become a place he fears.

The other new trait that driving me insane is the way he started playing fetch. After I throw his toy he comes back to me and launches his whole body into me instead of just stopping in front to play with the toy so I can toss it again. I know he's only 3 pounds so it's not like he's meaning to hurt me, but it's also not acceptable. He's hit my chin and cut my lip and knocked my nose into a nosebleed. Again, no and stop are just not working so I take his fetch toys away until he can calm down and then that sends him into a spiral.

He doesn't love walks right now (we are in NJ and cold + snow = nope, not doing anything but going to the bathroom). He gets plenty of exercise with brain games and mental stimulation such as his Kongs, puzzle toys, etc and then any type of playtime inside.

Lastly, it's the need for all the attention all the time. And of course, he's a puppy and I am his person and I do give him so much love *but* he knows when he can be a menace with it. If I am on my laptop on the couch he purposefully walks onto the laptop to stare at me, because he is not getting attention for 10 seconds. If I am on the phone, he does anything and everything to be a nuisance such as nip at my fingers, get the loudest toy he can possibly and squeak it around the apartment, find and try and destroy something in his path, like try to rip up a package on the ground he could have cared less about before the phone call. This one has become a huge problem being I work from home and 90% of my days are in mettings/on the phone. I have a small apartment so at the moment I don't have a private work area. I also have to stay tied to my companies VPN so going to a coffee shop or work space to work isn't an option.

85% of the day he's amazing - Chi's love their sleep and he does have so many amazing qualities. He's for sure my soul pup. He is now like a miniature tornado and has stopped listening when it is bad behavior. He listens so well when we do puzzle games/training and he's incredibly smart, so I know it's just him choosing not to listen to me when he is doing things he shouldn't.

I am trying to find a daycare for him 2 or 3 days out of the week as I think this would benefit both of us but he is only 3 pounds so there are not many dogs as small as him so he wouldn't get as much playtime as the other size groups have more playmates, and I don't want to pay for him to sit in a crate and have a little amount of playtime or even just only one on one because he's so small he can't be with the other groups. I have called around to a few but if I can find one with tinier pups, I think that would help a ton.

He is getting neutered in a few weeks but I am not expecting that be a magic solution.

I swear it was exactly at 7 months it was like a switch turned on to become a mini, yet very cute, demon. I have days where I have to go into a room and cry so I don't get too upset with him.

I think it is possibly we are just together too much. This is my first puppy solo, as all of the rest were either family pets or I had roommates, so I think underestimated how much it helped to have other people giving attention.

Whoever read through this in full, thank you for coming to my Ted talk because this is a novel, but needed a solid place to vent it out.",1,1768168978.0,puppy101,2,1.0,False

One Moment Message: How Slowing Down Can Strengthen Your Faith 🙏
----------------------------------------------------------------

In our fast-paced world, we often find ourselves caught up in a whirlwind of activities, responsibilities, and distractions. Yet, what if I told you that taking a moment to slow down could actually deepen your faith? Imagine sitting on a quiet park bench or sipping morning coffee, allowing the world to fade away — this simple act could open doors to profound spiritual insights and growth.

### The Power of a Pause

When we rush through our days, we miss out on the beauty of the present moment. Just as a camera needs to focus before capturing a picture, our hearts and minds need stillness to truly engage with God.

Consider Psalm 46:10, which says, “Be still, and know that I am God.” This verse serves as a gentle reminder to pause and refocus our attention on our Creator.

### Finding God in the Small Moments

Slowing down allows us to recognize God’s presence in the everyday. Here are three ways to cultivate that awareness:

1. **Mindfulness in Prayer**: Instead of a hurried “thank you” or “please,” take time to sit in silence with God. Reflect on your day, express gratitude, and listen.
2. **Nature Walks**: Stepping outdoors can shift your perspective. Allow the sights and sounds of creation to remind you of God’s handiwork. As Romans 1:20 states, “For since the creation of the world, God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen.”
3. **Meditative Scripture Reading**: Choose a verse and read it slowly. What emotions does it stir within you? How does it relate to your life? This reflection transforms the act of reading into a dialogue with God.

### The Blessings of Stillness

By carving out moments of stillness, we can experience numerous spiritual benefits:

- **Enhanced Clarity**: In stillness, our minds can hone in on what truly matters, allowing for clearer direction in life.
- **Strengthened Relationships**: Slowing down can improve our interactions with others, creating space for deeper connections.
- **Increased Peace**: A quiet heart is a heart open to receiving God’s peace, as described in Philippians 4:7: “And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”

### Reflective Questions

To deepen your journey, consider these questions:

- How often do you take moments to be still and connect with God?
- What distractions are keeping you from experiencing that stillness?
- How can you incorporate intentional pauses into your daily routine?

### A Call to Action

In a world that values speed and efficiency, let’s commit to carving out sacred moments of stillness. Choose one of the activities above, and try it this week. What do you discover during those quiet times?

In closing, I encourage you to share your thoughts or experiences in the comments below. How has slowing down transformed your faith journey? Let’s support one another as we seek to deepen our connection with God through mindful moments of stillness.

May your day be filled with peace, clarity, and the sacred beauty of one quiet moment! 🌟

Boy, what a letdown. IKEA has better quality furniture by a country mile. 

All the sofas, sectionals, and armchairs are absurdly low to the ground and are cheap-looking, and the few items I actually sat upon (a huge round chair and a sofa) were so incredibly hard that it felt like the only cushioning was from the upholstery. This is not an exaggeration. The sales guy even agreed with me about this and said that the pieces were very uncomfortable. (Points to him for his brutal honesty!)

The “wood” items, (like side and coffee tables) were mostly made of some type of composite and covered in veneers.

I really wanted to enjoy this visit and even thought I might purchase things I’d seen on their website, but reality cast a sad light over all their products. In the real world, these products don’t look like they do online, so buyer - beware.

only two of us work while two are disabled and one is a 7 year old with ADHD. 

my step mom is the bread winner. she provides 98% of the income for the house we live in in the suburbs. my brother has a job and pitches in as much as he can. but because of this we don’t have any money to waste. she’s one of the most important persons at her job, and top dog. she is extremely successful. 

my brother and i are adults and we pay rent because my step mom can’t do it alone. if you can’t tell, my step mom is the only one without ADHD. 

my brother with ADHD and my dad with ADHD play video games. my brother much more, my dad calls it an addiction.

my 7 year old brother takes ADHD meds every morning and when he forgets to take them we can all tell. when he comes home from school that’s around the same time his meds wear off so we leave him alone to his own devices when he comes home. reading homework is done while he’s tucked into bed, i guess to limit stress for him. so when he gets home he gets like maybe an hour on tablet, sometimes much less, but that’s only because he likes playing with his friends so much. so by the time he gets home until dinner he’s always outside playing his friends.

bath/shower and bedtime is a nightmare with him. i always feel bad for my step mom. my dad gets him off the bus, sometimes he’s busy and asks my brother or i to do it. he’s in charge of the 7 year old until my step mom comes home late and she’s the one that puts him to bed. 

i have a type of ADHD where i spend all day researching niche topics and mental health. i know SO MUCH useless information but its good in conversations and harm reduction. i know so much about mental health and mental healthcare that my case manager thinks i could get a job in mental health without getting a degree because i possess the tools and the knowledge from research and experience alone. 

we drink A LOT of coffee in this house. 

one rule of the house is that we have to come out of our rooms before and after dinner so we don’t isolate ourselves and our mental health doesn’t take a crash. this is hard, because as ADHD people we’d rather stay in our rooms and stay regulated than having to be around other people. 

we all get stressed as hell when we leave the house so when someone comes home we leave them alone.

it’s a very understanding environment for ADHD. my step mom is so cool and sometimes laughs at some of the stuff we do because of our ADHD. i imagine it’s both extremely frustrating but entertaining at times… mostly frustrating. we all have patience with each other. not just for our ADHD but our other mental disorders and illness as well. 

that’s not to say i don’t get called out when i’m in the wrong. we don’t use mental illness as an excuse but as a tool to help us grow.

the house gets really messy really fast. the 4 of us work hard to make sure my step mom comes home to a clean house. on the rare occasion that we don’t, it’s usually because my dad is running around trying to get other stuff done, my brother is at work, and i’m at my moms. 

sometimes when i open the fridge the peanut butter jar is in there. i once put the frozen waffles in the pantry, remembered it about an hour later, came back and put it in the freezer. cheese was also in the pantry but we got it out before it spoiled. 

my dad is a house husband since he’s disabled. he takes the most care getting everything done. groceries, things we need for the house, appointments, and sometimes a project in the garage. he also cooks superb dinners for the house everyday with fresh ingredients. leftovers are normally rare to find and are usually gone by dinner the next day unless it’s soup. 

we order takeout on the weekends. friday, saturday, and sunday are the only days of the week my dad doesn’t cook. my brother and i pay for our takeout so my step mom doesn’t have to cough up more money for us. 

even though i myself am physically and mentally disabled (i can’t stand for more than four hours at most), my dad is recommending me i get a job to pay for better mental healthcare. mental health is very important in this house and is a main topic of discussion and it’s important to my dad and step mom i get a job where they’re not so hard on me because of my ADHD (they exist! it’s all about who’s in charge) 

buddhism is strongly encouraged but not forced.

my moms house is very much not ADHD friendly so when i get to go to my dads for a few days it’s a huge stress relief. i’m not as on edge and i feel like i can relax my mind for the most part. i also get the BEST sleep because my nervous system is calm enough and i’m not always looking over my shoulder worrying about doing something “wrong”.

it’s uh… it’s hell at my moms tbh. absolute hell for someone who has any sort of mental illness, especially ADHD. if i happen to get a brain fart, as soon as i notice it, i’m called out. it’s bad. my step dad really makes it known im a burden to him and his house for having ADHD. one mistake leads to panic and then chaos. it’s not just me but my other siblings go through it too with him. it’s actually so bad his blood children have told me a couple times over the years they don’t respect him. 

which is one of the reasons why i wanted to share life at my dads. maybe this can be used as a tool for parents to be able to help their ADHD kid have a home they can feel safe in? personally, i think the reading homework at bedtime is probably the greatest idea. medicine can also really help your ADHD kid. my dad used to be against ADHD meds but after noticing that really did not help me in the slightest when i was growing up, he’s all for it now.

when parents understand their child’s mental illness and find ways to work with it, it relieves so much stress off not just the child’s, but everyone’s shoulders. with a good system in place it helps everyone in the house. 

another thing- it’s understandable our rooms will be messy. as long as we don’t keep dishes in our rooms for them to fester, it’s fine. we can have messy rooms as long as we can walk around it, it just can’t get dirty.

Today marks my 4 week update. 
Zero side effects so far.

Today i upped my dose from 2mg to 4mg

Currently down 13 pounds.

I spent dec 24/25 and dec31/jan1 eating and drinking like an animal. Im sure i could’ve dropped a couple extra pounds. 

I’ve made a few changes in my diet. 

Reincorporated carbs so now currently doing high protein mild carb diet, still doing 16:8 fast but somedays its a 18:6 depending on if they make coffee at the office or not while eating an avg of 1200-1700 cals a day. No cheat days on weekends and zero alcohol for now.

One thing I noticed is i’m more thirsty than usual so thats good i guess, helps me drink a more healthy amount of water.

Also just started taking GHK-Cu to help with loose skin in the future.

Quicksilver is the first book in Neal Stephenson's The Baroque Cycle, a historical fiction series set in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, following the intertwined lives of Daniel Waterhouse, ""Half-Cocked Jack"" Shaftoe, and Eliza, amidst the Scientific Revolution, political intrigue, and the birth of modern finance in Europe. The novel is known for its dense, detailed narrative that blends historical figures like Newton and Leibniz with fictional adventures, exploring themes of science, alchemy, and the clash between reason and ambition. !<

It devastated me because I would have never guessed this would have happened. She says she just doesn't have any interest in relationships at all and prefers to be alone which is opposite of me.

I met a girl who works at Aldi about a month ago. During our first interaction I asked about a product, learned her name, introduced myself, complimented her smile, and asked if she’d like to grab a coffee sometime. She blushed but politely said, “Sorry, no, I’m busy working.” I said no worries and left it at that.

I shop there regularly and see her often. I kept things respectful and brief. A few days later, she actually initiated a “Hi, you alright?” with me, and since then we just exchange short, friendly greetings when we make eye contact. No flirting, no long chats.

I really like her but don’t want to lose my self-respect by asking again after being rejected. So I’ve decided not to pursue it further unless she clearly shows interest first — which may never happen, since she’s always at work when I see her.

TL;DR: Asked Aldi employee out once, she politely declined. We now just exchange brief hellos. I like her but don’t want to ask again after rejection. Should I keep it friendly and move on, or wait for a clear signal?",0,1768168335.0,relationships,27,0.1,False

I've read several posts saying the next is the most problematic model and its been in the back of my  mind, 2 days ago I went to make my morning coffee using the festive double espresso and ill caffe pod. It tasted AWFUL. Bitter and weak. Used different pods and made another, same thing. Descaled the machine twice and factory reset. Same thing. Wasted about 7 or 8 pods. 

I called customer service and video chatted and did all the troubleshooting they asked for, they asked how long I had the machine and I told them its only been about 3 or 4 months. I assumed the next step was sending me a new machine. 

Wrong. She says they are sending me a new sleeve of pods to make sure its not bad coffee, despite me telling her and showing her I've used multiple different pods. She said her supervisor told her 'the machine wouldnt change the taste of the coffee' i said if it's not brewing correctly yes it would ??  I agreed to try the new pods but im sure my machine is done for. Has anyone else been through this ?? It seems bonkers to me that a less than 6 month old machine breaking wouldnt qualify for a new one immediately and their solution is to send new pods ? Im hoping once the new pods come (im sure they will be also be awful) they will send a new machine but this did not go how I expected.

Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 30 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

Out of curiosity I checked Vegas and they were super cheap. Checked MGM and holy crap, 4 comped nights except Dec 31st of course. We are on! Fourth trip this year and we just did Thanksgiving. I know, rookie numbers to some:).

Bucket list item 1. Flying in at night. Holy crap what an exciting view, my craps fingers itching before I even landed.

Stayed at MB of course. NYE vibe was weird! Service was off, vibe was low. I’m assuming that most gamblers were outside so tips were elsewhere. Had an okay craps session before stepping outside to watch the fireworks which were very cool and called it a nice night.

Note to self: When the cocktail waitress says welcome back and the craps dealers say the same thing review your actual spend! 

Day 2 explored Aria for the first time, beautiful property and a winning Wheel of Fortune sesh for the wife. Noted a few restaurants for future visit and saw a Rueben that made me drool!

Bourbon at the Four Seasosn. Wow, just wow! Don’t realize who much I would enjoy steeping away from the casino into an old world realm of luxury and the best Manhattan if mixed drink I have ever tasted. Very be had shifted back to normal and service was out of this world.

Went over to a semi remodeled Luxor. Center bar made it brighter, place was clean and smelled nice. Played $200 of blackjack for over an hour with plenty of comped drinks. Cheap way to relearn the game and a reminder that I had forgotten even basic strategy! Relearn and may make that a day game with coffee and soda! 

Wrapped up at MB winning a few bucks back.

Day 3, strip walk. Hadn’t done it in years. Never on the East Side and never again. The level of street vendors and skunk weed overwhelmed my old ass so we crossed over to the Park and toured Eately, absolutely on must do list for next time. I had no idea I could get meet or fish grilled on demand!

Cabbed down to TI for Mystere. It was good to see how this whole Cirque thing started and we enjoyed it. Big surprise was Gillies at TI, yes, the bar from Urban Cowboy. To walk in, beer in hand and see an outstanding country band including a fiddle that wasn’t afraid to play Footloose to get people dancing. 

Laying in bed I casually checked Raider tickets… $180 row 20, club level??? Oh hell yeah! Moved our flight, got an extra night for $54 and $204 air credit! Game was the game but at least $1500 cheaper than normal to sit in the best arena on the planet was worth it. KC fans showed up in force and Midwest people are nice. Guy next to us said that in Arrowhead, no one in the lower bowl sits for the entire game.

Wrapped it up with an excellent craps session to get my total loss down to $400. Grabbed a roady, danced a bit to the always excellent bands at Rythm n Riffs and good night.

Woke up with full blown flu on Teusday:( but worth it.

Too all the folks that treated us with such kindness and friendliness, thanks again, its that welcoming vibe that keeps us coming back.",1,1768167984.0,vegas,0,0.6,False

Please also don't message unless you meet my criteria. I appreciate kind works and good lucks but it becomes frustrating after a while.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this, more inclined to go higher than lower)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?
4. Would you rather live in 24 hours of daylight or darkness?",1,1768167958.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Since last October, he’s gotten everyone hooked on ginger cinnamon coffee and raw honey. When things get stressful, he brings us to his office to sniff lavender oil. He also keeps the entire color spectrum of gel pens in his bag so we can color coordinate everything.

I don’t think any of it works. We’re still stressed and tired, but he’s nice enough. Definitely the most interesting coworker I’ve had so far.",19,1768167930.0,coworkerstories,10,1.0,False
1qac2a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CommercialPrinting/comments/1qac2a0/help_us_move_on_from_primera_printer_hell/,Help us move on from Primera printer hell,"We coffee roastery where we print labels for both our main line of products and for white labeling. We also do small runs of coffees for weddings, events, and business gifting.  We get a lot of small batch coffee lots that we may only print 50 labels or so for.  We have a lot of different skus and custom runs that prevent us from simply ordering 10k stickers at a time in the same design.

We started small and I purchased a Primera LX600.  It was ""okay"" for the first few months but has grown into a PITA when it's time to print labels.  They shot their ink prices up 20% last year which were already high to begin with so I've been eying an upgrade. The feed roller likes to slip with new rolls due to their weight, the cutter sometimes cuts off the ends, the alignment is always a PITA, and they won't sell me basic maintenance parts to repair in house.

We've gone from doing a few hundred labels a month to thousands a month and we are about to open a new dedicated coffee roastery so the volume should go up even more.

With this in mind, what would be a comfortable step up from this POS Primera that would handle thousands of labels per month with room to grow into?  The largest sticker we do is a 4x5 and we currently buy their roll stock.

Something with refillable ink tanks would be ideal so we don't have to buy marked up cartidges all the time.  Initial price on the machine is less of an issue compared to the ongoing costs as volume increases.

Any suggestions on printer?  We are not interested in outsourcing our labeling. Thank you!",2,1768167901.0,CommercialPrinting,3,1.0,False

What happened to Mami?


Mini receives a double impact of contrasting news.


---


*I will leave the links to the previous parts in the comments. The entire story is joined for better tracking. If you haven't read the previous parts yet, I recommend doing so before starting this chapter.*


---


**The main threat was defeated; however, this is not the end. Something darker will take its place without anyone being prepared for its arrival. While the sun remains radiant in the sky and the first hours of the day unfold with apparent normalcy, in the shadows, a direct and ruthless attack has begun to be executed that will break the tranquility with a frenetic rhythm.**


**The war was about to end, but, in an instant, the enemy leadership changed hands. The emergence of a stronger, darker, and bloodier King has rewritten the rules of the game. Very soon, the first victims will be claimed.**


---


**A scheduled encounter had begun, with the mysterious girl being the first to go on the attack. Without leaving time for Chizuru to have space to analyze the situation or think about her movements, the girl placed the photo on the table as her first move. A second later, she launched her initial verbal offensive, leaving Chizuru with no room to process the impact of the revelation.**


**Yuzuki was too direct; she did not prepare the ground before taking out her cards, but instead lunged for her objective without hesitation. It was something Chizuru was not used to in her usual interactions; even so, based on a tenacious will, she did not let herself be intimidated and responded with a mixture of firmness and caution to her question.**


Chizuru: ""Nakamura-san, I don't know what you are looking for, but I will not be intimidated. Hypothetically, even if the photo were genuine, you won't get anything from me. I came here because my manager is a friend of your father's; so, before 'confirming things,' as you say, I would like to know more about you and your intentions. Let's calm down and start over. Tell me, what would you like to order? A coffee or do you prefer a dessert?""


**Yuzuki listens attentively. She perfectly understands what Chizuru is trying to do. However, she does not give up on her intention and formulates her next move, revealing more details that break any attempt at normalcy.**


Yuzuki: ""So that's how you want to play... Good try, but I don't plan to wait any longer. The photo is real. How do I know? I'm very observant. I saw a girl running scared with her 'boyfriend' by the hand and, a second later, I found the photo in the machine's tray. However, when I investigated at my school to return it to you, I discovered that you had already graduated. Curious, right?""


**Yuzuki pauses, takes out her cell phone, and shows an image of Chizuru Mizuhara, the rental girlfriend, on the screen. Chizuru goes cold, not knowing what to say, but Yuzuki continues without giving her a break.**


Yuzuki: ""And then... I see you on television with a new leading role. Shortly after, the controversial news breaks and your life hangs by a thread. By the way, congratulations on your press conference; what a great performance, you almost convinced me. But, I repeat, I don't want to hurt you. Just let me give you my theory.""


**Chizuru clenches her fists under the table and one of her feet begins to shake rapidly; still, she makes an effort to respond normally.**


Chizuru: ""You are very smart, but that's already old news. Of course, he was my client before, but I don't know what you're getting at with this. I'll only tell you one thing: don't you dare do anything to... Kaz... to my friend.""


**Yuzuki listens with microscopic attention and notices it immediately, answering with a mixture of curiosity and sarcasm.**


Yuzuki: ""Interesting... very interesting. I never mentioned anything about him, why are you defending him like that? You've told me everything yourself. But fine, let me give you my theory.""


**Chizuru mentally reproaches herself for her mistake; she cannot respond, she knows she has said too much. Instead of trying to correct herself, she prepares to listen to what the girl has to say without further interruptions. Yuzuki continues.**


Yuzuki: ""This photo started everything. After looking at it several times, I noticed something subtly hidden: this girl is pretending to smile. However, I could also notice flashes of something real in others... You know how to go unnoticed, I could never find you; but that role in the play gave me your name, and that fake news gave me something that confirmed everything. Let me explain.""


**Chizuru does not stop being surprised by the girl's intelligence; she read her perfectly. Remembering that day, and with her feelings on the surface, Chizuru was able to internally confirm each of her words. While silence took over the table, Yuzuki took out a notebook and began to write with almost detective-like precision.**


Yuzuki: ""You had a rental date with this boy, but it was more than that, right? Later, I confirmed the identity of the producer boy from a photo of the movie premiere that an actress friend gave me. Very possibly, this boy became very important after that and I can be almost sure that he helped you overcome your family loss. Also, that jealous girl's audio seemed quite real; her pain was authentic. Added to what the 'source' declared, this is more than just a fight between enemies; there is something that connects it all.""


**Yuzuki continued making notes, drawing lines and symbols; it seemed as if she were trying to unravel an international conspiracy. Chizuru could do nothing but listen, amazed and scared at the same time.**


Yuzuki: ""I shouldn't have to say it, but your last response has confirmed it. Kazuya Kinoshita is the center of all this. That 'client' looked very excited in the photo; in love, if you'll allow me. The fact that he made a movie for you confirms it for me. Therefore, those girls are your rivals and Kazuya is your boyfriend. But something doesn't fit: why do you let them keep bothering you like this?""


**Yuzuki stops writing and fixes her gaze on Chizuru's eyes, looking for a deeper crack.**


Yuzuki: ""And also, why do you deny the relationship in public? From what I see now, you're still worried about him... so, why are you lying?""


**Chizuru feels a lump in her throat. Yuzuki's logic is so precise that it only makes her feel more pathetic; another person had found the answer while she sailed in a sea of confusion and denials for months. She answered her question with a sad and defeated voice.**


Chizuru: ""Boyfriend? Sure... it seems like that, right? I'll be honest with you: we never became that. He really loved me, but I... I didn't understand it. I made him suffer, I was an idiot. Happy? There you have it. Those girls were still there because of me, because of my indecision. And for that very reason I haven't lied: we are not that, not now... and maybe never.""


**Yuzuki stares at her. She sees the real woman, finally out of her armor, and begins to speak after letting out a slow sigh.**


Yuzuki: ""So that's what happened... What a complicated woman. Did you say he 'loved' you? Why do you speak in the past tense? How can you be so sure of that? I'm sorry... it wasn't my intention to make you have a bad time. I really thought you would just accept that you are more than friends; I didn't calculate this result, I apologize.""


**Chizuru listened to her feeling a hint of tranquility. Now she knows that this girl is not bad, but the pain does not go away so easily. Suddenly, Yuzuki changes her attitude drastically and begins to speak in a somewhat strange way.**


Yuzuki: ""I don't accept it! This love story doesn't end here. I will help you; I didn't spend more than a year imagining like a fool your all-loving and cheesy courtship for it to end in this. As a lover of romance, I will not leave things like this. Your story is worthy of being the most impossible modern love story I've ever heard, and I won't allow you to give up so easily. I decree that you will be a couple and you will get married! I will do the impossible to achieve that goal, so lift up that face, woman, and tell me what happened!""


**Chizuru blinked several times, completely stunned. The detective-like coldness that Yuzuki had demonstrated had evaporated, leaving in its place a familiar but multiplied intensity that left her speechless. The situation changed so drastically and impossibly that it was as if a violent storm suddenly vanished before the simple breath of an old man; the danger disappeared, leaving only absolute strangeness.**


**Chizuru took a breath, feeling a strange calm. Everything was so unexpected that it made no sense; however, the surprise made her forget her depressed state and she realized something instinctively: this girl was serious.**


Chizuru: ""But... what happened to you? Are you serious that you made that whole speech for this? You're crazy! But... thanks. I think, maybe, it was me who judged you wrong. I'll tell you, but... lower your voice, will you? I don't want anyone to find out, do you agree? Don't you dare tell anyone anything, understand? Swear it to me.""


**Yuzuki nodded. She placed a hand on her notebook, imitating a judicial oath from a court, and her gaze fixed on Chizuru with a fierce loyalty.**


Yuzuki: ""I swear it. I, Yuzuki Nakamura, swear here and now, by my honor and by my parents, that I will not reveal to anyone what I hear here. And if I break my word... let the Reaper come for my soul! Is that okay? Or do you prefer that we record it? Wait, let me find something to prick my finger, these things must be left written in blood to have validity...""


**Chizuru looked at her with a mixture of horror and confusion. It was complete madness, but for some reason, that extreme intensity was so rare and authentic at the same time that it gave her the security she needed. However, she noticed that the girl had actually taken out some scissors and was about to hurt herself, so she immediately interrupted the action.**


Chizuru: ""Wait! Calm down, it's enough, don't hurt yourself... uh... mmm, write it with normal ink and that's it. And about the recording... it really wouldn't be bad... Wait! No! What am I saying? It's enough, don't do anything else! Ahhh, seriously, how did we get to this? Nakamura-san, you're so weird...""


**Chizuru rubbed her temples. She was being overwhelmed by Yuzuki's intensity; it was as if she were sucking the energy out of her with every word. The feeling, however, was somewhat familiar; it was like her streamer friend, Mini, but on a higher scale of eccentric madness; it was overwhelming. Still, at least she was able to regain some tranquility by perceiving her authenticity; she left behind that unsettling feeling of danger in her chest.**


**Chizuru closed her eyes for a moment and, letting out a long and deep sigh, gave a small dry clap. She needed to reset the current atmosphere, leave the chaos behind and calm down in the process. Upon opening her eyes, her gaze had changed suddenly, passing from confusion and sadness to absolute determination.**


Chizuru: ""It's enough... Listen carefully, Nakamura-san, because I won't repeat it. Surely you heard Grandma Nagomi's interview, knowing you, but there was something else... I will trust you, so don't make me regret it. After the accident... Kazuya... woke up in the hospital without the ability to remember the last two years of his life. That erased me from his existence without leaving a single trace. And... that's all. I'm sorry, but I won't say anything else until I trust you totally.""


**Yuzuki remained silent for what seemed like an eternity, processing the magnitude of the information she had just heard. Her eyes scanned the notes in her notebook, analyzing every detail at superhuman speed. Finally, she closed her notebook with a snap and spoke again, with a serious voice and in a complete state of shock.**


Yuzuki: ""I understand... Retrograde amnesia. Now that I didn't expect... What a dramatic turn of events! But now I understand everything: from your defensive attitude to your lack of clarity before the public. This is a total reset, a blank canvas. I can deduce by looking at you that things with the boy are bad currently... and I'm almost sure that the controversial news was the main cause... How complicated. But all is not lost; he is at his house, you just need to keep convincing him little by little... Fine, it's okay, I think I know what needs to be done...""


**Chizuru lowered her gaze, clenched her fists tightly over her knees, and her lips contracted in synchronization. She felt a critical impact in her heart before that reality that no longer existed, bitterly remembering the moment she couldn't prevent his departure.**


---


— *Kazuya: ""I've had enough, miss actress, Ichinose-san. Let's leave it here, I won't listen anymore. I'm tired of hearing excuses and lies to my face... Honestly, I thought you were different. Truly, for some reason, I don't hate you, but I can't help feeling disappointed right now. Take care...""*


---


**Chizuru relived every sensation in a blink, but tried to contain it all within her without saying anything. Or so she thought, since a solitary tear escaped, sliding down her cheek and falling directly onto the table, leaving a Yuzuki speechless as she was already preparing to tell her plan.**


**The image of the perfect and elegant actress broke in a single phrase. Yuzuki was stunned at such a demonstration of vulnerability; the strategist and lover of love stories finally understood that this was very serious, reflecting on herself and her actions. Chizuru wiped her face with a quick movement, regaining her composure; however, the silence between them was, for the first time, something that took control.**


**A new bond had been formed; two girls had connected at last. The wall between them thinned and, without saying a word, silence sealed their connection. The conversation had reached a turning point, leaving the bases ready for the next interaction.**


---


**At the same time, in another part of the city, Mini was having breakfast, a ""melonpan"" (melon bread) freshly taken out of its packaging and a cup of strong coffee with milk, sweetened with a common sugar substitute. Her face made it evident that she had barely gotten out of bed, with her hair disheveled and her pajamas still on.**


**Checking her cell phone just after waking up and yawning lazily, she found a piece of news that left her surprised, but relieved at the same time. The trends of the last few hours had taken a radical turn, shifting the focus of attention away from Chizuru Ichinose's controversy.**


Mini: ""Well, well... it seems that social networks have fresh food to devour with intrigues and unfounded comments... People surprise me more every day; they can be really unpleasant.""


**On her screen, the following could be read:*


---


**SHOCKING**: ""Shiunji Kaname's seven children... Were they actually all adopted?!""


---


**Mini slid her finger across the screen with curiosity to know more. The news was a media bombshell: an article that questioned the authenticity of the blood ties of one of Japan's most famous and influential families, the owners of the ""Ban-K"" conglomerate, exploded like an atomic bomb in the morning trends, flooding the networks in a matter of minutes.**


Mini: ""Incredible... I didn't even know anything about these siblings. How lucky it must be to live with such luxury, but that doesn't justify the vultures judging them like that... What? The Shiunji company already recorded a drop in the stock market so soon? Uff... Rumors can really destroy the stability of an entire empire in a blink. I feel sorry for them, truly, but this is good for us! If the attention shifts to them, they will end up forgetting to bother us.""


**Mini let out a sigh of genuine relief, biting her melon bread with excitement. For a moment, she felt that fate was giving them a breather.**


**However, when updating her YouTube Studio app, a blood-red banner appeared at the top of the screen, making her choke from the shock. The text said:**


---


***Community Guidelines strike:***


Your channel has 2 strikes. The video ""Exclusive Interview: The Truth Behind the Scandal"" has been removed for multiple legal violations (Privacy and Image). 


You cannot upload content or perform broadcasts for 14 days.*


---


Mini: ""What...? It can't be! Yesterday everything was fine!"".


**She stood staring at the screen, processing the impact. That video had been the one from last night's livestream.**


Mini: ""Oh, damn it! I completely forgot to hide it because of the Master's sudden call. This must be because Ruka-chan mentioned Mami's name and because of the photo of that evil blonde that I put... But it was only for a second! Damn it!"".


**Anxiety began to take hold of her; she began to scratch her arms compulsively while continuing her analysis aloud.**


Mini: ""Ruka, Ruka... you see what you do, woman. Ahhh! If I explained everything to you... Heavens, I don't believe it! It hasn't even been a day! They must have sent separate complaints to achieve this... What do I do now?"".


**With her heart beating like crazy and her hands that wouldn't stop shaking, Mini entered her Gmail inbox, looking for answers or something to help her understand the disaster. There, just below the automatic YouTube notifications, was a message that had no logos; only a sender from a private law firm.**


**With nothing to lose, she opened the email that said:**


---


**SUBJECT**: Notice of extrajudicial legal process – (Confidential)


""You are informed that the restriction of your channel is the result of the dissemination of private information and the illicit use of personal image. If you wish to avoid the definitive removal of your account (3rd strike) and the initiation of a criminal process in the Tokyo District Court, you are granted a single opportunity for private mediation with our legal representative.""


""Call the attached number to coordinate an immediate meeting. No intermediaries or external legal representatives will be accepted to make this option valid.""


---


**Mini stared at the email without saying a single word; her mind also went blank for an instant, causing her to drop the piece of melon bread from her hand onto the plate. The relief of a few moments ago was overshadowed by the current surprise that made her stomach churn. Her career was being legally threatened, and everything would end if she didn't do something soon.**


Mini: ""This is... a vulgar disguised threat. Who do they think they are? But... I don't have much else to do. What am I supposed to do? This is horrible... Does Mami have that much power for this? Damn it! I don't know... but they have me where they want me.""


**She leaned back in her chair, looking at the ceiling and reflecting on her next move.**


Mini: ""What do I do? If I don't go, I lose everything; but if I go, I risk an even worse threat or who knows what else... I must do something, but I can't think like this. I'll take a shower to try to clear my head.""


**Mini got up from the chair and walked to the bathroom almost in zombie mode. All her effort was being hijacked simply for doing the right thing and helping her friends. She had nothing to be ashamed of and, even so, they had her in their claws for who knows what purpose. The sound of the door closing marked the beginning of her final reflection and her next decision.**


---


**While a new dark phase began to unfold in Tokyo, collapsing the relative calm that had settled into the atmosphere, far from all the rising chaos and more than two hundred kilometers away, a beautiful blonde with bluish eyes opened her eyes again after the perfect family ambush she had suffered the previous night.**


**The first thing she observed upon waking up was a completely new and unknown dark wood ceiling. Her eyes, still heavy and dazed by the side effects of the sedative, kept her pinned to the floor, unable to check where she was now. However, she felt the hardness of the cold ground; reaThelizing that she was not lying on the comfortable and fine mattress of her home in Tokyo.**


**The sensation of the air was fresher and purer, and the smell of grass was intense. With great effort, she managed to sit up and began to examine the surroundings. All she saw was a traditional-style room, almost as if she were in an old, typical, and boring hot spring inn.**


**Suddenly, Mami noticed a perfectly folded Yukata beside her next to a pair of wooden sandals. Looking down, she noticed she was still dressed in the clothes she wore the day before.**


**Little by little, she managed to regain her strength and stood up, ignoring the Yukata with disdain. She began to quickly search for her cell phone among her clothes, but found nothing; she didn't even have her headphones. She was completely devoid of any type of modern technology. Irritated, she began to analyze the situation.**


Mami: ""I am in Nagano... that bastard really did it. They must have snatched my purse and cell phone while I was sedated. The Yukata tells me there is someone else here. I have no idea where exactly I am, but I have to get out right now. Everything is too silent; it is possible that the person watching me has gone out. I must check; I must move now.""


**Mami put on the sandals and began to walk; she was surprised to find that the door was open, sliding the shoji aside with caution. In front of her, she came across an interior Zen-style garden in perfect condition; to the sides, she could only observe a long polished wooden hallway alongside several wooden doors and walls.**


**Not a single soul in sight; only an empty and disturbing silence, broken only by the thin and dry tapping of the Shishi-odoshi, which resonated throughout the place every time the bamboo hit the rock. The natural lighting gave the feeling of a place more than perfect for meditating, something that felt extremely strange to Mami, who, despite her distrust, began to explore.**


**She walked slowly, trying to silence her steps so as not to betray her position to the potential guard of the mansion. As she continued forward, she noticed that each of the doors she left behind was identical to the previous one, as if she were trapped in an infinite loop. Her anxiety increased with every step she took toward her freedom, until she reached what appeared to be the main foyer of the building.**


**In front of her was the door to the outside, alongside an elegant marble sculpture and a modern-style rug. Mami noticed nothing else; her attention was fixed on the exit. As she approached, she looked back, but she was still alone. Then, she proceeded to slide the door with great delicacy to avoid making any sound that would condemn her.**


**Upon stepping out, her pupils dilated at the direct contact with the sunlight, leaving her dazzled for a few moments. As she removed her hand from her face and adjusted to the brightness, the first thing her eyes found was a dreamlike view: a radiant and beautiful flower garden adorning a cobblestone path, which surrounded a large sculptural fountain rising right at the center.**


**Mami had not the slightest interest in admiring anything, so she walked quickly toward the large wooden gate that was wide open, revealing what appeared to be the outer street of a rural village, with only a gray wall on the other side of the road.**


**As she crossed it, she could feel a cold draft on her skin while stepping onto a narrow cobblestone path, illuminated by the morning sun. To her left, there was a gate identical to the one she had just crossed, but it was closed, blocking any other escape route. Only the other side remained: a hallway that seemed endless between two gray walls topped with rustic tiles, creating a single possible path.**


**Mami stopped for a moment to catch her breath, looking with contempt at the stone walls surrounding her. Frustrated, she thought out loud:**


Mami: ""Damn it, are you kidding me? Where is the road? I can't hear a single car; only the sharp and annoying sound of the stupid birds behind me. I can't see where this damn street ends. Where on earth am I? Ahhh... I'm fed up, but I have no choice, I must keep going...""


**Mami resumed her advance with a firm step without losing her state of alert. Each strike of the sandals echoed throughout the corridor, so she began to mind her gait with mastery, moving cautiously to minimize the noise on the cobblestones. However, after a few seconds, she had to stop again; the pain in her feet, aggravated by the wooden footwear she was not used to, was starting to be an unbearable nuisance.**


**After a brief rest of just a few moments, she kept moving forward until she reached the end of the hallway with a throbbing pain that kept growing. Because of this, she momentarily lost her focus on what was in front of her; only when she perceived a sudden change in the intensity of the light did she look up. In that instant, she was completely in shock, paralyzed by seeing the reality before her eyes.**


---


**Before her, a cruel and dark truth rose: she had no way to escape. That momentary freedom she thought she had obtained had collapsed like a house of cards in a single glance. She was a prisoner.**


**Mami looked with helplessness at the enormous stone wall that lay at the end of the horizon. For a second, she deceived herself into believing she was in a small rural village; but, as she continued to observe, her crude reality cleared up immediately. Before her stretched a vast main plaza adorned with multiple impeccable gardens and fountains worthy of royalty that no humble municipality could afford.**


**She observed a beautiful natural pond in one of the corners, accompanied by a gazebo and small wooden bridges. Countless buildings with unified roofs were distributed in every direction, connected by their own internal streets. As if that weren't enough, an absurdly large gate rose right at the center of the wall.**


**That was when she understood it all: this was a perfectly fortified** ""***Yakata***.""


**Suddenly, a voice cut through the silence and Mami's shock in an instant. Looking in the direction where the sound came from, she saw her: an old woman in her sixties flanked by two young girls at her sides. All three wore their respective Yukatas elegantly, remaining motionless as if they had been waiting for that precise moment to reveal themselves.**


Old Woman: ""Good morning, Miss Nanami. I see you have recovered your energy to come out for a walk through the fortress. Where is your Yukata? Did you perhaps not find it when you woke up? It is a personal gift from the honorable Hakuba-sama himself. It is not proper for a young lady to ignore such a kind gesture. Breakfast is ready. Please, accompany me back to the mansion, we have things to talk about; the Master left me in charge of your education. It will be a pleasure to be the instructor for the wife of Hakuba-sama's son.""


**The impact of the old woman's words hit Mami with a hostile force. The wife of Hakuba-sama's son? It was an archaic, disgusting, and insulting way to refer to her; however, looking again at the immense wall and the three figures surrounding her, the burning fire of anger and rage she felt inside was replaced by cold and simple calculation.**


**She couldn't escape, she couldn't communicate, she was hungry, and she didn't have a single miserable yen. If she wanted to get out of there, she had to understand where she was and trace an infallible escape plan. Mami exhaled a long sigh, letting her shoulders drop subtly and transforming her expression of shock into one of feigned shyness and regret.**


Mami: ""You're right... I'm very sorry for my lack of manners. Waking up in an unknown place confused me a bit, but now I understand where I am. I am calmer now; please, give my father-in-law my thanks for the beautiful gift. Guide me back; I am hungry and I will be delighted to listen and learn a lot from you.""


**The old woman nodded with a calculated smile, perfect and sharp. Without another word, she made a brief signal to the two assistants and the group began the walk back. Mami walked in the center, escorted as if she were a high-value piece of porcelain and, at the same time, as if she were a prisoner with her guards leading her toward her cold cell.**


**The illusion of freedom broke at once, leaving behind only the peaceful landscape of the Japanese mountains, acting as a witness to the moment, illuminated by the warm rays of the sun on the horizon.**


---


And we are back! My apologies for the delay; between a busy week and the mental break I took, the days flew by. But we have returned with more strength. I won't say anything else, just wait for the continuation; I promise not to take as long next time.

I went in for a dual Fraxel treatment with a very well-regarded derm in my area this past Wednesday for some pitted acne scarring and general anti-aging. She said that she was going to go pretty intense since I’m pale and should tolerate it well. I was definitely puffy and red and had some undereye swelling on the first day, and skin has been a bit rough - but I’ve been shocked that I really haven’t seen any “coffee grounds” or pigmentation sloughing off my skin except for very small areas near my eyes and forehead. Also have no taken any meds. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience? I’m expecting to do at least one more fraxel treatment but almost feel like I’m not getting my money’s worth without a crazy reaction! 😂 This honestly doesn't seem much different than a reaction after using too much tretinoin in terms of dryness/roughness.

I (34M) got a job here last year and have been renting a place off Alberta st for the past 5 months. I didn't know anybody prior, and have since met a couple cool people via groups, outdoor recreation, and even Reddit.

The first month or so I was absolutely in love with the city and my neighborhood. I adore all the coffee and food options nearby. I'm also a big music fan so I've been making an effort to go to various venues for shows as of late.

But despite all this, I just feel like I don't really.. fit in? Don't get me wrong, I'm very outdoorsy, I love music, etc., so on paper it seems like this would be my paradise, but whenever I'm in public, I just get the vibe that I don't belong. Everyone hangs out in groups, and usually my efforts to strike up conversation don't go anywhere. It feels like I'm doing all the typically recommended things for a new guy in a new city: participating in activities, going to shows, going to bars, doing hobbies, etc., but it still feels like I haven't connected with anyone past surface level conversations. It almost seems like the socially-successful people here have some sort of secret ingredient I'm not privy to, haha.

I'm certainly progressive, but it feels like because I don't wear clothes a certain way or have colored hair, people don't want anything to do with me. I'm probably preppy by this city's standards lol. I'm not trying to be petty or hyperbolic here, btw. I'm just venting about how I truly feel when I'm in these social settings.

I’m also divorced so I’m sure this just compounds my feelings of loneliness and lack of belonging.

During our first interaction, I asked her about a product, thanked her, asked her name, and introduced myself with a handshake. I complimented her smile and asked if she would like to grab a coffee sometime. She blushed and politely said, “Sorry, no, I’m busy working,” so I told her to just take it as a compliment and left it there.

I go to that store regularly and see her often. For the next couple of days, I didn’t speak to her, and then one day she initiated a short conversation by saying, “Hi, you alright?” I replied politely and asked the same back. Since then, when we make eye contact, I just say “Hi, you alright? Hope your shift is going well,” and keep things brief and respectful so I don’t seem pushy.

I realise my timing in asking her out was probably too early. She didn’t know me then, though now she recognises me. I like her, but after that initial rejection I don’t have the confidence to ask again. To protect my dignity and self-esteem, I’ve decided not to ask her out again; if she’s interested, I’m hoping she might give some sign, although that may never happen because she’s always at work when I see her.

1qabtuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1qabtuk/long_distance_dating/,Long distance dating,"In October I decided to book a month long trip to explore Europe, with a focus on the UK. (November 22 to December 23.) Then I reached out to a girl from Insta from Ireland who I could just tell was someone I’d appreciate. Got to know her some and asked her out. She has an 18 month old girl and was abandoned by the father while pregnant. We went on a date and she brought her daughter (childcare is rough, and I told her it’s absolutely fine) and it went very well. She offered a second date during the first, so we went on one the next day, just us. She even wore a nice dress and heels because I’m tall haha. It was a lovely evening. She had us take some pictures together. And me take a bunch of her outside. I had to leave for the next 2.5 weeks for the rest of my trip, and she even offered to do laundry for me. We stayed in light touch. Sending reels, story replies etc. I sent her flowers. She posted them on insta. When I came back we went on another date. Children’s museum, lunch, children’s play place. I held her daughter a bit, pushed the stroller, played, it was a really nice time. We also started building a little deeper of a rapport. She even posted part of my body when she posted our food. When she knew I was gonna take the train to my Airbnb, she asked to drive me home. Half hour each way at night after a long day. She even stopped and offered to get me snacks when she got some. As I was getting out, she asked I wanted to get coffee the next day after work. I kissed her daughter goodbye on the head. Instead of coffee the next day, had dinner. We’d also made plans to get out of the city the following day. At that after work dinner she told me she couldn’t see me again before I went back to the U.S., because of family things. Twice when parting she told me to keep in touch, in a heartfelt kinda way. But, I was still sad to not see her again.

Before and during my visits, her life has been so difficult, over capacity, over stimulared, and worrisome for her, so I know making time and letting me in like that mattered.

I’d already grabbed a few little Christmas presents on my travels in England, so I messaged to ask if I could drop them off somewhere or whatever’s convenient. She offered to meet me on her way to work for a few. I gave her more flowers and a few little gifts. She adored those flowers. Posted them to insta. We window shopped and talked a bit. She bought me a drink. She said “We should write letters and you could come visit again and if I win the lottery I can come visit you for a week!” That really shocked me in a good way. She then told me to let her know when I got to the airport. I let her know when I boarded my plane and turned my data off. Once I got home, two days before Christmas, I turned it on and got a message saying “Thank you for everything, it was really nice meeting you, I hope you have a happy Christmas.” Gutted, I replied “You too.”

It really stunned me, because she had offered visits and such without any prompting.

I didn’t reach out all Christmas week, but New Year’s Eve morning I liked her story, and when she woke up, she sent me a reel and a message.

I tried to keep things going but felt so confused. I sent her a message saying “Hey, you never felt like a burden to me, and I’m not sure what made you pull away, but if there’s anything It’d be helpful for me to understand, you can tell me. (The burden thing is because she apologizes a lot and does feel like a burden.)

She said “I didn’t think I pulled away?? Something something - I just was keeping things friendly and relaxed.”

I told her I appreciated her clarity and that I was feeling things bit differently and then I wished her well. 

She let it sit on read for a couple hours then said “It was lovely hanging out and if you’re ever back in town we could do something!!”

I didn’t respond, and then the next morning she sent me a post, so I asked her about her weekend, she told me a bit, and she left my last question on read, like almost a week ago now. She still looks at most of my stories and has liked one of me dancing in my car. I dunno. 

One interesting part is that on our third date I mentioned how she’s so used to doing everything alone as a mom that when I help I am just in the way. It was warm and funny, we laughed. Later that night she sent me a reel of a woman shoving a man out of way to carry a Christmas tree and the text over it said “When you’re independent but decide to get a boyfriend.”

I wouldn’t think she’d let that through for nothing, ya know?

Well anyway, she’s 34, I’m 37. I’ve been married from 21-33, and had other relationships. Had someone who bored me, and someone who was a powerful connection. I’ve experienced a lot. This however, well, if a year ago you’d asked me to write down what would be ideal in a woman for me, it’d have described her. Her fashion, her absurd dark humor, her values, goals, lifestyle, what she eats, etc. I’ve never held so much alignment with someone inside and out. It didn’t have my nervous system going, not even my charming entertaining side. It was just like a quiet beautiful knowing. Knowing that this isn’t lust or attention, but someone I truly enjoy and appreciate. Someone who would probably make a very good partner for me if given the chance.

But here we are. Silence is information. A closed door and a ball in her court. It’s not rejection that kills me, it’s ambiguity, ya know? So I’m lost. Right now, I’m not reaching out. I don’t want to push, or lose my dignity. I have chosen to not date for a while, but I think she’s worth it. Maybe she just isn’t into me. Maybe she’s simply overwhelmed with life. Maybe when I left, with her abandonment fears and logistics, she realized she couldn’t hold this right now. We didn’t hold hands or kiss but we hugged hello and goodbye, and sat next to each other at dinner. She also didn’t mind when I put my hand on her shoulder once or picked things off her shirt. Maybe she wasn’t romantically into me, maybe she’s just scared. I dunno!

She talks a lot in person, which I love, but in messages she is a lot more filtered. I know she was shy growing up and is trying to not be a people pleaser anymore. 

Either way, I’ve never quite been here before. If you made it this far, you’re a real trooper!!!

1qabqt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/floorplan/comments/1qabqt4/need_help_with_apartment_layout/,Need help with apartment layout,"Hey folks,

I was hoping to get some help switching up the layout of my apartment. I unfortunately have NO interior design skills whatsoever (architectural wise to start here) and I was hoping to get some advice on my current layout:

https://preview.redd.it/cs81cz8tfscg1.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=0388bbbd70b94990096ec1c9bfcf217a121f69e9

I know it's too cluttered, the coffee table and dinner table were a last second decision, but they were deals hard to pass up on and saved me \~$1000 min. However, should I consider downsizing them? How can I reorientate my apartment to have a better flow? (i'd also like to add that the yellow wall between the gaming/office and guitar area is a wall of acoustic panels I'm currently working on building).

I forgot to label the doorways, but the one to the left of the TV is the kitchen, right is the hall to the bedroom/bathroom. The door on the lonewall is the enterance (door opens outwards luckily.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, I could really use it

Edit: the apartment is 135""x284""",1,1768167157.0,floorplan,0,0.67,False

1qabp27,https://i.redd.it/bu6ucuxegscg1.png,Can the De'Longhi Stilosa actually make good coffee?,"Can the De'Longhi Stilosa actually make consistently good coffee or do I need to upgrade?

I've had the machine 8 months and upgraded:
Portafilter to open
Basket to IMS 18g
Tamper
wdt tool
Pick screen (not shown)

I already had the 1zpresso k-ultra grinder and Timemore Black Mirror Coffee Scale for my v60 and aeropress.

When making an effort to dial in I feel like I might get a good espresso 1/5 shots and even that shot is no where near as good as the coffee shop. Most of the time they taste harsh or astringent. The good shots don't have this but are missing the nice subtle flavors and taste relatively flat compared to the coffee shop.

I've got to the stage where I've stopped trying and just use steamed milk for a flat white or hot water for an Americano which does a lot of work in still making it relatively enjoyable to drink.

Process:
18g coffee in
Turn on machine 
Once I see first coffee drops I stop the machine and allow 5s preinfusion
Turn on again and and turn off once coffee hits 36g for 2:1 or 45g for 2.5:1
I set the grinder so I get somewhere between 23-35s total time including time waiting for first coffee drops and pre-infusion 

Issues:
Machine keeps dripping once turned off. Difficult to hit exact 36g out. Need to stop at 31g for example and then pull cup out.

Machine has no temp control. No clear guides on how to install PID. Or solution isn't ideal and not as good as Gaggia (can only place temp sensor on outside). 

Machine has no pressure control I think or can go up to 15bar (I think I've read this online). Most machine have pressure release valve that opens at 9bar.

Grinder step size quite large, one click can cause 10-15s time difference 

Timemore scales. I think it drifts. In picture you can see it measures 17.6g about 1-2min after measuring out 18g.


Additional questions:
Can 36g out vs 41g out cause an amazing shot to turn terrible? Is espresso really that sensitive? Or should it go from amazing to good? 

I haven't tried playing with my water used. I really hope it's not this. I asked one coffee shop nearby what they use and they said they use tap water so hopefully that's not my issue.

My filter coffee on V60/aeropress drinkable but I don't get these amazing tasting notes that others describe. I've also tried filter coffee in a coffee shop and tasted some of these notes. Maybe I'm just bad at coffee.",5,1768167043.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

I can see a wide, grey-blue carpet with a regular, structured pattern on its surface lying on the floor right next to me. Its color is matte and dark and it is shaped like a large rectangle. On my couch table to my right lies a mid-sized, thick book with a turquoise-grey colored cover. It is shiny and within arms reach. Right next to me is also a black, shiny, tall coffee mug. It is cylindrically shaped and gets a bit wider towards the top. I can see a white, tall door in front of me. The door, that is about 2 meters away from me, has rectangular shapes on its surface and a white-matte finish. I can see a dark, hand-sized postcard hanging on the white wall in front of me. The postcards features a picture that is dominated by black and white colors and is shaped like a small rectangle. 

I can hear the low and calm sound of a saxophone. The sound of the saxophone is smooth, not too loud, but clearly audible and features a lot of drawn out notes. I can hear my teeth clenching into one another. The sound of my teeth meeting each other has low and high notes and is a bit quieter than the saxophone that I can hear alongside them. I can hear my breath streaming through my nose. The sound of my breath is whooshing, wide and fairly quiet. I can hear the quiet melody of a piano playing high notes. I can hear the sound of my over-ear headphones whenever I turn my head. This sound is low and feels very close to my ears and my skull.

I can smell the sweet scent of the empty chocolate bar wrapper sitting next to me. The smell is quite faint, but very distinct and smells of warm cocoa. I can smell the salty and savory scent of the leftovers of nuts in a snack cup sitting next to me. The scent is pretty intense and smells mainly of roasted hazelnuts. I can smell the clear and synthetic scent of paper when putting my nose close to a book that I hold in my hands. I can smell the slightly stuffy, fatty scent of cream when I open the tub of handcreme lying next to me. I can smell the floral and slightly dusty scent of my blanket.

I can taste some chocolate and strawberry flavors in my mouth after having eating a chocolate bar earlier. The taste is sweet and warm like cocoa, but also sourish as strawberries are.

I can feel the rough and cool texture of the blanket covering my legs. I can feel the cool, smooth and rectangular surface of my phone. I can feel the rough and dry texture of the back of my left hand. I can feel the soft, fuzzy and mildly warm texture of my sweater. I can feel the warm, slightly rough and thin texture of socks covering my feet.",1,1768167021.0,dailygrounding,0,1.0,False

•Schedules meetings and complaints/conversations over small issues, looks very uncomfortable and awkward at me. 

•They had a not so nice talk about someone else they are friends with while I was reading a book, and started screaming for me to leave the room.

•Roommate seems to be on a mission to complain as much as they can to others in gc to make it seem like I’m not helpful or that I’m difficult. Unnecessary chat interactions, seems like they are trying to get “receipts”.

-We’re visiting from Türkiye so we don’t really want middle eastern kind of cuisine, we’d prefer anything but hamburger, pizza type of thing would work better. Any coffee shops, bakeries (this one is important), bars and restaurants that are cheaper compared to the regular prices in Oslo would be appreciated.
- We made plans for the daylight (We’re going to the sauna, toboggan run, we bought a cross skiing tour from get your guide) but after the sky gets dark and the shops are closed, we don’t know what to do. I found a bar named tilt where we can go and play arcade games. Those kind of evening activities would make us happy.

1. STAR RANK OF INGREDIENTS DO NOT EQUAL STAR RANK OF DISH.
-This seems to be the case even if you've leveled up so higher star ranks are possible. Be mindful of the star rank of your ingredients as some can be sold higher as is rather than in a dish. It is entirely possible to use all 2 or 3 star ingredients and still get a 1 star dish.

2. INGREDIENT VARIANT DOESN'T AFFECT DISH PRICE.
-For dishes like Fish and Chips or Salad, the type of ingredients does not affect the final sell price of the dish. Be mindful of which fish you are using as some can be sold for far more gold than the dish itself. The same applies with crops. 

3. SOME DISHES UNLOCK NEW DISHES DEPENDING ON INGREDIENTS.
-However! There are dishes that actually unlock NEW dishes depending on the ingredients. So the price of the dish only changes if you've basically unlocked a new recipe. One example is Mixed Jam. If you use all blueberries, you unlock Blueberry Jam and that has a different sell price. This doesn't always happen as the Grilled Mushroom dish also unlocks other dishes but all of them sell for the same price regardless. 
-This far I've unlocked: Blueberry Jam, Raspberry Jam, Apple Jam, Mandarin Jam, and Tomato Sauce. As well as each version of grilled mushroom (Grilled Shiitake, Grilled Button Mushrooms, Grilled Oyster Mushrooms, Grilled Penny Bun. NOTE: there is no Grilled Truffles recipe. Don't waste your tuffles.) Looking at the Collection app, it seems we also have things like Grape Jam, Pineapple Jam, etc that we'll eventually be able to make. I assume some forageables don't spawn until a certain level or these are all crops we'll eventually be able to plant as gardening is leveled.

4. WHERE DO I FIND ALL THE MUSHROOMS?
-There are a few variants of mushrooms in the game that can be gathered and each can be found in a particular area:
SHIITAKE near the Fishing Village (I generally go from the bus stop and follow along the road close to the fences and light posts)
PENNY BUN in the Forest (my preferred route is around the wandering tree guy and down along the lake to the camping site to the west of the bus stop. You can literally ride the bus right there and just make your rounds)
BUTTON MUSHROOM near the Flower Fields (I start at the base of the hill and follow along next to the swing and back further east around the nearby hill)
OYSTER MUSHROOM in the Onsen Mountain (this is another one that you can ride the bus right into the route I use. I go down across the nearby water and continue south east around the rock to the light just before the wooden bridge then go back to the bus stop, where I then go up the nearby slope and go across the rock bridge and around the little hot spring area starting from the left and go back around to the bus stop. NOTE: the capybara trough is down the slope on the far side of this spot if you wanna feed them)
TRUFFLE on Forest Island (they take much longer to respond than others but there's like 3 or 4 spawn points there. They'll look like dark piles of dirt)
-I have yet to find Matsutake. I've heard that you have to be at a certain level for them to spawn amd they supposedly spawn close to trees in the Spirit Oak Pine Forest.
-Bizarre variants spawn in the same places as the normal versions at random but you can't cook them.

5. PRICE OF INGREDIENTS VS PRICE OF DISH
This is what I've found so far with the limited dishes I've unlocked. I'm sure someone will make a spreadsheet eventually but I hope this helps for now. Feel free to correct me if you think I'm wrong anywhere

SALAD 
(2 CROPS: 2x1* TOMATO=60, This is the best choice for the most profit if 1* dish is assumed. 2*tomato is also fine here ss the dish would still add 10g value in that case) 
-1* 90 / +30 gold value for 1*tomato

GRILLED MUSHROOMS 
(4 MUSHROOMS: 16x4=64, all edible mushrooms with the exception of truffles and probably matsutake sell for 16 gold)
-1* 180 (all versions) / +116 gold value

MIXED JAM 
(ANY MIX OF 4 FRUIT, honestly better to sell a specific type of jam.) 
-1* 160
BLUEBERRY JAM 
(4 BLUEBERRIES 16x4=64)
-1* 170 / +106 gold value
TOMATO SAUCE
(4 TOMATOES 1* 30x4=120)
-1* 180/ +30 gold value (same as salad)
RASPBERRY JAM 
(4 RASPBERRIES 26x4=104)
-1* 250/ +146 gold value
APPLE and MANDARIN JAM
(4 APPLES OR MANDARINS 28x4=112
-1* 270/ +158 gold value

COFFEE 
(4 COFFEE 30×4=120)
-1* 290/ 170 profit
LATTE 
(2 COFFEE, 2 MILK 30×4=120. Milk and coffee cost the same so latte is the better choice between the two for now as these are ingredients bought from Mossimo)
-1* 300/ 180 profit


FISH AND CHIPS 
(2 FISH, 2 POTATOES. 2x1*potatoes=180. Fish that have best profit assuming 1*dish: 
1*50g fish=Common Bleak, Minnow, Sardine, Schneider, Horse Makeral, Sea Stickleback, Spined Loach, Tench. All other fish are better off being sold directly are used elsewhere assuming 1*dish)
-1* 310/ +80 gold profit (for 50g fish+1*potato)

CHEESECAKE 
(CHEESE 100, MILK 30, 1*WHEAT 285)
-1* 480/ +65 gold value (assuming 1*dish. This subtract the cost of the Cheese and Milk. 2*wheat is better sold directly unless you're sure you're getting a 2*dish)

SMOKED FISH BAGEL 
(FISH, 1*WHEAT 285, CHEESE 100, CROP. Note low price fish above. Tomato is the cheapest crop. So assuming a 50g fish and a 1*tomato, the sum of those with wheat is 365 so you're getting a 55g increase. A 75g fish would still be profitable here as well. So the 2* of those above and a few other 1* fish of slightly higher value)
-1* 520/ +55 gold value (for 50g fish+1*tomato+1*wheat)",3,1768166454.0,heartopia,1,1.0,False

1qabf53,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qabf53/do_not_watch_this/,Do Not Watch This,"I’m writing this here now because I’m not sure when I’ll get another chance. I’m not sure I’ll live long enough to recount this event in its entirety. 

My name is Donavin Meeks. I’m 22 years old, and last month, I found a VHS tape. 

I had been rummaging through my attic, searching for some old Halloween costumes I could pull back out for old times' sake, just to get into the ol’ holiday spirit. 

I’ll preface by saying, much like many others, my attic was almost backroom-ish. 

The way the dust had collected amongst the clutter, and how the cobwebs seemed to decorate the beams that supported my roof, the atmosphere alone was unsettling enough. 

As I searched through box after box of old knick-knacks, photo albums, and stocking stuffers that nobody used anymore, I finally managed to find the cardboard box labeled “Halloween” with a little cutely drawn spider with a smiley face beside it. 

All hail the Gods of irony, because as soon as I lifted the box, the biggest black widow I’d ever seen came running out, its legs clicking against the hardwood.

I *hate* spiders, so this obviously caused me to jump backwards, tripping and falling over some other boxes and immediately flailing like a maniac in fear of a bite from the arachnid. 

Hopping to my feet and checking ferociously for any sign of the thing on any part of my body, I happened to glance down at the mess of boxes I had just created. 

Lying in the center of the scattered clothing and Christmas decorations, lie a VHS tape. 

Unlike the other items, the VHS tape was completely dust free, and seemed as though it had been watched to about the halfway point. 

I picked it up to analyze it and found that it had been labeled “Do Not Watch” in black permanent marker over white painters tape. 

Staring at the words, I couldn’t help but feel utter intrigue. 

Not only had I never seen the tape, I had never even OWNED a VHS player. 

I mean, I’m 22, honestly, what am I going to use one of those things for? 

The dams of curiosity broke within the first two minutes of my discovery, and off I went, down to the local pawn shop to find my VHS player. 

It cost me a solid $5.98. One of the perks of being obsolete, I guess. 
Upon returning home, I was bewildered to find that the mysterious videotape was no longer on the coffee table where I had left it. 

Living alone, this turned out to be incredibly concerning to me. 

I began to rack my brain, thinking of how I could have misplaced the thing. 

I distinctly remembered placing it directly in the center of my coffee table. I mean, I checked under the couches, on the dining room table, my bedroom, bathroom, every room in my house had been checked. 

I began thinking that it was my mind that had been lost instead of that damn tape. 

I stayed up into the early morning hours because the idea of something that distinct just vanishing like that; it irked me. 

My mind already tends to wander and teeter on borderline paranoid schizophrenia, and this event did NOT help. 

Once I finally DID choose to go to bed, my sleep was shakey at best. 

I couldn’t have been asleep for more than an hour and a half when the abrupt sounds of what seemed to be footsteps awoke me. 

I could have swore that I heard the sound coming from directly above me, yet, once I fully regained consciousness, they had stopped completely. 

I had first put it off as a dream, a mere trick of the mind, similar that feeling you get when you’re falling in your sleep. 

That thought gave me comfort, and allowed me to doze back into sleep. However, that comfort was quickly vanquished when the same sounds started up yet again. 

This time I KNEW what I had heard, and I wasn’t about to just lay in bed defenseless. 

I immediately threw the covers off of myself and grabbed the bat that I keep beside my bed in case of home intruders just like this one. 

Being sure to make a lot of noise so the intruder KNEW that I was coming. I wanted them afraid, I wanted them to feel what I had been feeling. 

I yanked the attic door down and began climbing the ladder, flashlight in one hand, bat in the other. 

I hyped myself up as I ascended, preparing myself for whatever may lay within the plane of darkness which is my attic. 

Once I got about 6 inches from the entrance, I called out. 

“I know you’re up there! I hope you know I’m calling the cops, AND I’m armed. So just come on out please. Don’t make this any harder than it needs to be.” 

I waited a few moments and received no response. 

The silence was daunting, and cut through me.

The hot attic air seemed to grow chilled. A distinct drop in temperature that made me shiver. 

“Just come on out, man. We can work this out just as soon as you come out and make yourself known!” 

I waited a few moments once more, and once more, received no response. 

“Alright, I’m coming up! I swear to God if I see any movement whatsoever from you, I am bashing your head in!” 

I slowly began to ascend what remained of the ladder. 

My right palm sweat profusely wrapped around the rubber grip of the bat, whereas my left hand shook the beam of the flashlight ever so slightly. 

I began to scan the room with the beam, making sure light touched every surface possible from the attic entrance. 

Everything seemed still. Calm. Untouched, if it weren’t for where the few boxes I had knocked over prior. 

Though my light landed on no one, it did happen to fall upon a familiar plastic black rectangle, placed right back in the center of the spilled clutter. 

“No fucking way…” I thought to myself. 

Cautiously, I made my way towards the VHS tape, practically spinning in circles with my flashlight as I inched closer. 

Still, no sign of an intruder. 

I reached down and retrieved the VHS tape. 

Just then, a whole wall of boxes came tumbling over from across the attic, followed by the sounds of swift footsteps that seemed to approach me at an inhuman pace, only to completely dissipate as soon as it was before me. 

The flashlight and bat were both shaking wildly now as I spun around the room, sweating and petrified. 

“COME OUT! COME OUT RIGHT NOW!” I screamed. 

The attic was now eerily silent again. 

As I stood there, shaking and on the brink of a panic attack, the sound of creaking floorboards scratched the back of my mind, and a deep, booming voice spoke from behind me. 

“Boo.” 

I flew across the attic at a speed I didn’t know I was possible of achieving, 

I was down the ladder so fast that my foot ended up getting caught on the last rung, causing my ankle to twist, followed by a sickening POP that shot pain throughout my entire leg. 

I had saved my videotape though, and this time, it wasn’t leaving my side. 

I ended up having to spend the rest of the night and next morning in the hospital getting x-rayed and having my foot casted up. 

I had ended up breaking my ankle, and all I could tell the doctors was I tripped while climbing out of the attic. 

Anyway, I returned home as soon as I was cleared, anxious to finally watch this VHS that seemed to had randomly appeared in my home, as well as some sort of unwanted visitor. 

I never really fed into the whole paranormal thing, but holy shit, man. The true horror that I felt in that moment up in that attic; it made me a believer instantly. 

Well, I should say that it made me believe that things can be ATTACHED to objects. Whether it be holy or demonic. Attachments can happen. 

And I believe that’s what the case was with this tape. 

Once I arrived home, I was determined to finally view its contents.  

Something that I had failed to notice upon retrieving the tape from the attic was that now, instead of being half way through, it was completely rewound to the very beginning. 

Not only that, but the black marker had now been turned…red? It looked as though a completely new label had been placed on the tape. It looked…flashier. Like the *CAUTION* tag on a bottle of chemicals. 

“DO. NOT. WATCH. THIS.” 

Yeah, right. Who WOULD’NT watch this? 

Arriving home, I found that my house had been completely trashed. 

Cabinets were thrown open, couch cushions ripped off and strewn across the floor, pots and pans sat neatly across every counter top. 

Luckily for me, my VHS player had remained untouched, and sat where it had been just below the TV stand. 

Unbothered by the mess, unbothered by the clear red flags, I sat down in front of my television and popped the tape into the player. 

Nothing happened at first. Just a black screen that lingered. 

Suddenly, blasting white and black static came scratching across the display. 

I jumped a bit, and felt my heart drop before steadying. 

Slowly but surely, the picture began to become clear and smooth. 

The first thing to come into view was a mailbox. 

A mailbox that stood displaying my exact address. 

My heart began to speed up again. 

As the picture video became clearer, I was able to make out the sidewalk that led to my front porch. 

Then my front door. 

Then my stairs.

The attic door. 

The ladder. 

And then darkness as the person recording nestled into a dark corner within the attic. 

The video then remained that way. Black stillness for an uncomfortably long period of time. 

There was a sudden and harsh skip in the frames and now the camera was panned to the attic door from within the attic. 

Distinct shadows could be seen through the cracks in the doorframe, shadows that seemed to be that of a certain 22 year old man, living alone. 

There was another cut, and now the recorder appeared to be crouched in a new corner of the attic, filming as the door to the fell open and footsteps began to climb the ladder. 

I watched in horror as my own head popped into frame, waddling up the stairs, completely oblivious, as I searched through box after box for a stupid Halloween costume. 

The video then abruptly ended, right before the black widow came crawling out from under the package causing me to jump backwards and fall. 

The next cut was a shot of my living room. It showed the camera slowly approaching the tape that lay on my coffee table. 

Another sudden cut. 

A hand was now in frame, pale and decrepit. It carefully placed my silver spaghetti pot atop the kitchen counter before patting it softly, then panning the camera around the room to reveal the mess that had been created. 

The next and final cut revealed me, yet again, cautiously searching the addict with a flashlight. Eyes wide and apprehension painted clearly across my face. 

I stared at the television in absolute dismay. Frozen. My jaw dropped cleanly to the floor. 

I remained in a trance-like state for the remainder of the footage, broken only when the video abruptly ended, and was somehow replaced by live footage. 

Live footage that showed a 22 year old man, who lives alone, sitting in awe, as he watched himself on the television. 

My mind took longer than I care to admit for it to put the pieces together, but once it did, it was too late, and the sound of heavy footsteps began echoing from the television, and the live footage inched closer and closer to my spot on the sofa. ",1,1768166408.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

This event is open to everyone ages 18+ and is part of our open community programming, welcoming neighbors and friends from across Marine Park and the surrounding area. Everyone from southern Brooklyn is welcome to join, including those from Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, and beyond—we are proud to bring together people from neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn.

Admission is $5, and we’ll be serving fresh popcorn and water to all attendees. The admission cost helps us rent out the coffee shop for the evening and directly supports Nick, the owner of Marine Park Coffee, for hosting the gathering and making the space available for a private community event.

We’ll be screening The Drop, a Brooklyn-set crime drama starring James Gandolfini and Tom Hardy, with several scenes filmed right here in Marine Park. It’s a great local film with a strong neighborhood connection and a perfect pick for a relaxed winter evening.

While many of our core events are designed specifically for young adults, this movie night—like our Live Music events—is intentionally open to the wider community. These events are about creating accessible, welcoming spaces where people can connect locally.

We’re also in the process of planning to file as a 501(c)(4) social welfare nonprofit, focused on strengthening community ties, supporting local businesses, and offering accessible programming that benefits the neighborhood as a whole.

Please RSVP on Partiful so we can plan accordingly:

I was down the ladder so fast that my foot ended up getting caught on the last rung, causing my ankle to twist, followed by a sickening POP that shot pain throughout my entire leg. 

I had saved my videotape though, and this time, it wasn’t leaving my side. 

I ended up having to spend the rest of the night and next morning in the hospital getting x-rayed and having my foot casted up. 

I had ended up breaking my ankle, and all I could tell the doctors was I tripped while climbing out of the attic. 

Anyway, I returned home as soon as I was cleared, anxious to finally watch this VHS that seemed to had randomly appeared in my home, as well as some sort of unwanted visitor. 

I never really fed into the whole paranormal thing, but holy shit, man. The true horror that I felt in that moment up in that attic; it made me a believer instantly. 

Well, I should say that it made me believe that things can be ATTACHED to objects. Whether it be holy or demonic. Attachments can happen. 

And I believe that’s what the case was with this tape. 

Once I arrived home, I was determined to finally view its contents.  

Something that I had failed to notice upon retrieving the tape from the attic was that now, instead of being half way through, it was completely rewound to the very beginning. 

Not only that, but the black marker had now been turned…red? It looked as though a completely new label had been placed on the tape. It looked…flashier. Like the *CAUTION* tag on a bottle of chemicals. 

“DO. NOT. WATCH. THIS.” 

Yeah, right. Who WOULD’NT watch this? 

Arriving home, I found that my house had been completely trashed. 

Cabinets were thrown open, couch cushions ripped off and strewn across the floor, pots and pans sat neatly across every counter top. 

Luckily for me, my VHS player had remained untouched, and sat where it had been just below the TV stand. 

Unbothered by the mess, unbothered by the clear red flags, I sat down in front of my television and popped the tape into the player. 

Nothing happened at first. Just a black screen that lingered. 

Suddenly, blasting white and black static came scratching across the display. 

I jumped a bit, and felt my heart drop before steadying. 

Slowly but surely, the picture began to become clear and smooth. 

The first thing to come into view was a mailbox. 

A mailbox that stood displaying my exact address. 

My heart began to speed up again. 

As the picture video became clearer, I was able to make out the sidewalk that led to my front porch. 

Then my front door. 

Then my stairs.

The attic door. 

The ladder. 

And then darkness as the person recording nestled into a dark corner within the attic. 

The video then remained that way. Black stillness for an uncomfortably long period of time. 

There was a sudden and harsh skip in the frames and now the camera was panned to the attic door from within the attic. 

Distinct shadows could be seen through the cracks in the doorframe, shadows that seemed to be that of a certain 22 year old man, living alone. 

There was another cut, and now the recorder appeared to be crouched in a new corner of the attic, filming as the door to the fell open and footsteps began to climb the ladder. 

I watched in horror as my own head popped into frame, waddling up the stairs, completely oblivious, as I searched through box after box for a stupid Halloween costume. 

The video then abruptly ended, right before the black widow came crawling out from under the package causing me to jump backwards and fall. 

The next cut was a shot of my living room. It showed the camera slowly approaching the tape that lay on my coffee table. 

Another sudden cut. 

A hand was now in frame, pale and decrepit. It carefully placed my silver spaghetti pot atop the kitchen counter before patting it softly, then panning the camera around the room to reveal the mess that had been created. 

The next and final cut revealed me, yet again, cautiously searching the addict with a flashlight. Eyes wide and apprehension painted clearly across my face. 


I stared at the television in absolute dismay. Frozen. My jaw dropped cleanly to the floor. 

I remained in a trance-like state for the remainder of the footage, broken only when the video abruptly ended, and was somehow replaced by live footage. 

Live footage that showed a 22 year old man, who lives alone, sitting in awe, as he watched himself on the television. 

My mind took longer than I care to admit for it to put the pieces together, but once it did, it was too late, and the sound of heavy footsteps began echoing from the television, and the live footage inched closer and closer to my spot on the sofa. ",1,1768166330.0,stories,1,1.0,False

During our first interaction, I asked her about a product, thanked her, asked her name, and introduced myself with a handshake. I complimented her smile and asked if she would like to grab a coffee sometime. She blushed and politely said, “Sorry, no, I’m busy working,” so I told her to just take it as a compliment and left it there.

I go to that store regularly and see her often. For the next couple of days, I didn’t speak to her, and then one day she initiated a short conversation by saying, “Hi, you alright?” I replied politely and asked the same back. Since then, when we make eye contact, I just say “Hi, you alright? Hope your shift is going well,” and keep things brief and respectful so I don’t seem pushy.

I realise my timing in asking her out was probably too early. She didn’t know me then, though now she recognises me. I like her, but after that initial rejection I don’t have the confidence to ask again. To protect my dignity and self-esteem, I’ve decided not to ask her out again; if she’s interested, I’m hoping she might give some sign, although that may never happen because she’s always at work when I see her.

This event is open to everyone ages 18+ and is part of our open community programming, welcoming neighbors and friends from across Marine Park and the surrounding area. Everyone from southern Brooklyn is welcome to join, including those from Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, and beyond—we are proud to bring together people from neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn.

Admission is $5, and we’ll be serving fresh popcorn and water to all attendees. The admission cost helps us rent out the coffee shop for the evening and directly supports Nick, the owner of Marine Park Coffee, for hosting the gathering and making the space available for a private community event.

We’ll be screening The Drop, a Brooklyn-set crime drama starring James Gandolfini and Tom Hardy, with several scenes filmed right here in Marine Park. It’s a great local film with a strong neighborhood connection and a perfect pick for a relaxed winter evening.

While many of our core events are designed specifically for young adults, this movie night—like our Live Music events—is intentionally open to the wider community. These events are about creating accessible, welcoming spaces where people can connect locally.

We’re also in the process of planning to file as a 501(c)(4) social welfare nonprofit, focused on strengthening community ties, supporting local businesses, and offering accessible programming that benefits the neighborhood as a whole.

Please RSVP on Partiful so we can plan accordingly:

1qabajn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1qabajn/was_the_behavior_of_this_colleague_and_her/,Was the behavior of this colleague and her husband normal?,"
I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a female colleague who was 50, four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We would chat and go to lunch together, sometimes with other colleagues. She would also bring me homemade dishes because she knew I enjoyed good food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks; I felt she was almost like a big sister. Occasionally, she acted childishly around me—for instance, one day she ran toward me to talk to me like a child, and she would tease me during our discussions. Every time a workplace meal was organized for a celebration, she insisted I participate, even though I don’t typically enjoy work social events. Afterward, she would become colder and more distant. Sometimes she would ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to run some errands. She often suggested outings with the children, but I systematically refused because I had no desire to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management—a kind of harassment that was very difficult for me. For several months, I didn’t speak to anyone at work, focusing only on my tasks and trying to get through that tough period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied, ""I have a lot of work,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance on the metro, and she came over to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirting (she got very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, and leaned in very close to speak to me). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close against me. I didn't know how to react because she is older, and I was quite surprised.

I eventually found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and said she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the day, she took me out and asked if she had done something wrong and why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been suffering from harassment and had been looking for another job, which I had found.

She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't because of her. She then continued to make flirting gestures, such as touching my hand. I then told her that since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with the children and spouses (this might have been a mistake on my part!). Delighted, she organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly—always with our respective spouses at my request, as I didn't want us to meet without her husband and my wife. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and didn't tell her, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that's not nice."" Yet, it was her choice, and frankly, I didn't care. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he doesn't invest himself, that he just sits at home drinking coffee, and that he is old. When I asked her how they met, she told me he was the one who hit on her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick—something her husband could have done.

She had promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested she come to the house with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day, after an outing with her son and mine (exceptionally without the spouses), she said, ""Let's meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, so once we arrived at my house, I thought we would chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself and did the dishes without saying a word. It was very bizarre. Then she said, ""The meal is ready, I have to go now."" She left the premises without even having a conversation. In my opinion, it was a truly strange scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family; I told her I knew that country well and preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family instead. I found that weird.

She began organizing outings with both families herself—booking hotels, suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home, or outings with the children to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go abroad together or to a mountain chalet. She also suggested organizing a ""girls' trip"" for her and my mother to a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations at each other's homes, she suddenly stopped giving any news. Just like that. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot... One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble furniture—a plan made weeks in advance—and on the day of, he bailed on me. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I went to pick him up by car, he said to me in the auto during the trip: ""If she wants us to separate, no problem."" I didn't understand that comment.

Then, no more news at all... I wrote to her several times to see if everything was okay, and she replied briefly. I then sent New Year's greetings to her husband, but got no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.

I finally confronted her via SMS several months later, after hearing nothing... I asked her why they had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised renovation information. She wrote back saying she was on vacation. I wrote to her: ""The two of you disappeared without giving us the promised contacts; you are users (profiteurs)."" She then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship ends.""

1qabadn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/1qabadn/sunday_blues/,Sunday Blues,"Why do I sometimes feel sad on Sundays, even if I love my job?  For me, there isn't any sadness or anger that a new work week is starting tomorrow.

I wonder if it has anything to do with the idea that no one is doing anything?  Not that I'm always hanging out with people; I am an introvert and only have a small group of friends that don't even live around me.  But just the idea of everyone bumming around home makes me a little sad.  I start to overthink parts of my life or worry about the future.  The weird part is, I'm a pretty religious person, so shouldn't I believe in the Sabbath and the idea that it's okay to do nothing and rest on Sundays?

I've been trying to stay off of my phone on Sundays and not text anyone or scroll social media, because I'm thinking this could help.  I could be more present, with my family members, myself, and maybe even God.  Even if being with myself means sitting and watching a show or movie, which I think is a better use of time than scrolling.  So far, on most Sundays, I go to church, have a coffee date with my dad afterwards, watch a few episodes of a show, talk with my parents at lunch and dinner, maybe go on a walk, and read a chapter of a bible book I have.  Then, I get ready for bed, because those things take up most of the day.

If anyone has felt this, has any tips for things I can do, or ideas as to why this feeling happens to people, I'd love to hear them.  Happy Sunday and thanks for reading!",1,1768166104.0,SeriousConversation,1,1.0,False

There’s a kind of heartbreak nobody warns you about.

It doesn’t come from screaming.

It doesn’t come from betrayal.

It doesn’t even come from the dramatic ending people picture when a marriage falls apart.

It comes from something quieter.

Something slower.

Something you don’t feel killing you until you’re already hollow.

For the longest time, I tried to understand what happened to me.

Someone once asked me:

Was it anger?

Resentment?

Boredom?

Distance?

Or did she simply stop loving you?

Five possibilities.

Five explanations.

Five bullets laid out in a row.

I sat with them longer than I should have.

Every one hurt.

Every one seemed possible.

Every one could have been the reason.

But the truth wasn’t any of those.

It was indifference.

A clean, point-blank shot to the soul.

Silent.

Precise.

The kind of wound you don’t recognize until you realize you’re already bleeding from the inside.

Indifference doesn’t slam a door.

It builds a glass one.

You can see her through it.

Making coffee.

Laughing at her phone.

Walking through the life you built.

You’re only inches away,

but somehow completely out of reach.

You knock.

You wave.

You hope.

Nothing.

Then one day you notice something worse.

It isn’t a glass door.

It’s a one-way mirror.

You see her clearly.

She sees only her own reflection.

You become the darkness behind the glass.

Still alive.

Still trying.

Still hoping.

Invisible.

And here is the part I didn’t understand until I was already emptied out.

People who are hollow inside will quietly take from the people who aren’t.

Not out of cruelty.

Not out of strategy.

But because they don’t have what you have.

And your warmth is the only thing that keeps them from feeling their own coldness.

So they drain you without noticing.

They borrow your strength because they have none of their own.

They depend on your stability to keep their world from falling apart.

They lean on your compassion because they can’t create any themselves.

And once they feel steady again,

they don’t look back to see if you’re drowning.

You were their life preserver

until they reached the shore.

After that, they walk on

like you were never holding them up.

That’s what indifference really is.

The hollow turning away from the full.

The hardest part wasn’t that she stopped loving me.

The hardest part was realizing she didn’t care enough to understand why.

She didn’t ask.

She didn’t look up.

She didn’t notice the collapse happening inches away from her.

And while I drowned silently,

she moved through her days untouched.

But here’s the truth no one tells you.

Eventually, something inside you breaks in the opposite direction.

You stop staring at the mirror.

You stop begging to be seen.

You stop wondering what you did wrong.

You start noticing the room you’re trapped in.

And you start looking for the door.

That’s when the seasons inside you start to make sense.

You survived the fall.

The moment everything cracked open.

You survived the winter.

The long, empty season when you were cut back to almost nothing.

Pruned down by someone who feared your growth.

Then, without noise or ceremony,

spring arrives.

Not dramatically.

Not all at once.

Just a little warmth in the chest you haven’t felt in a long time.

A small breath you didn’t know you lost.

A reminder that something in you is still alive.

Because you were never dead.

You were a tree waiting for sunlight again.

And your roots remember how to grow back.

You begin to remember who you were before the mirror.

Your laughter.

Your voice.

Your passions.

Your dreams.

Your life.

And one day, finally, you understand the truth.

It wasn’t that you weren’t enough.

It was that she couldn’t see anyone past herself.

Indifference didn’t erase your worth.

It revealed hers.

And walking away from someone who couldn’t feel you

isn’t the end of your story.

It’s the beginning of your return to it.

Because when you break that one-way mirror

and step through the glass,

you discover that everything they drained out of you

is already coming back.

Not perfectly.

Not instantly.

But undeniably.

Life is here.

Sunlight is here.

Spring is here.

Summer is coming.

And you, after everything,

will bloom again.

Stronger.

Fuller.

More alive than she ever allowed you to be.

Surviving indifference isn’t just survival.

It’s rebirth.

1qab6pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/comments/1qab6pu/bloodwork_was_okay_but_felt_terrible_audited_my/,"Bloodwork was ""okay"" but felt terrible. Audited my environment for Xenoestrogens (Plastics/Phthalates) and the brain fog lifted.","I know the main answer here is usually ""hop on TRT"" and I get that. But for those of us trying to maximize natural production first, or those on TRT who still feel high estrogen symptoms like lethargy or water retention, the environmental factor is massive.

I have been diving deep into the literature on **Xenoestrogens**. These are synthetic chemicals that mimic estrogen in the body, bind to receptors, and crush natural production. I spent the last few months auditing my apartment to remove these endocrine disruptors.

Here are the 5 most common ""Testosterone Killers"" that were sitting in my home and what I replaced them with.

# 1. The Non Stick Pan (Teflon/PFAS)

That convenient non stick frying pan was the first thing to go. When heated, the coating (PTFE) breaks down and releases per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) into food.

These are known as ""Forever Chemicals"" because the body cannot easily excrete them. Studies have directly linked PFAS exposure to lower testosterone levels and smaller testicular volume in men.

**The Swap:** I threw out anything labeled ""Non stick"" or ""Teflon."" I replaced them with Cast Iron and Stainless Steel. Yes, they are harder to clean, but scrubbing a pan is better than scrubbing your hormones.

# 2. Polyester Underwear

This is the silent killer. 90% of modern men's underwear is made from Polyester, Nylon, or Elastane. These are plastic based fabrics.

Plastic is an insulator. It traps heat. By wearing plastic underwear, you create a greenhouse effect around your testicles. Your scrotum is designed to hang away from the body to keep the testicles 2 to 3 degrees cooler than your core temperature. This is required for optimal sperm and testosterone production. Polyester disrupts this thermoregulation.

Additionally, the friction of polyester generates an electrostatic field which has been shown in animal studies to suppress T levels.

**The Swap:** I got rid of anything with more than 5% synthetic fabric. I switched to 100% Cotton or Merino Wool boxers (loose fitting).

# 3. The Plastic Kettle and Coffee Pods

I used to wake up, put a plastic pod into a machine, force boiling water through it, and drink the result. Or boil water in a plastic electric kettle.

**Heat + Plastic = Poison.** When you heat plastic, it leaches phthalates and bisphenols (BPA/BPS) into the liquid. You are essentially drinking a ""microplastic tea"" every morning. These chemicals are potent endocrine disruptors.

**The Swap:** I switched to a glass kettle (ensuring the lid isn't plastic) and now use a Stainless Steel Moka Pot or French Press instead of plastic pods.

# 4. Thermal Receipts

This sounds paranoid but the science is solid. Thermal paper receipts (the shiny ones you get at the grocery store) are coated in free BPA or BPS.

Unlike the BPA in hard plastics, this BPA is ""free"" meaning it is not bound to a polymer. It absorbs through the skin instantly. One study showed that holding a receipt for just 5 seconds can transfer significant amounts of BPA into the bloodstream. If you use hand sanitizer before touching it, the absorption increases by 100x.

**The Protocol:** I decline the receipt. If I must take it, I hold it by the very edge (the non printed side) and wash my hands immediately after. I never put them in my pocket.

# 5. Scented Candles and Air Fresheners

That ""Ocean Breeze"" smell isn't real. It is a chemical cocktail stabilized by **Phthalates**.

Phthalates are used to make scents linger longer. They are also well documented anti androgens (substances that block testosterone). When you burn a scented candle, you are vaporizing these chemicals and inhaling them directly into your bloodstream via the lungs.

**The Swap:** I threw out the Glade plug ins and cheap candles. I switched to 100% Beeswax candles or essential oil diffusers (using organic oils).

**Summary** You cannot out train a toxic environment. You can lift weights 6 days a week and eat steak, but if you are marinating your cells in estrogen mimicking chemicals, you are fighting a losing battle.

In the past during trips back I've suggested going for local / Chinese food (in a few cases pushing back on their initial suggestion of those kind of coffee and brunch places downtown) and while they were generally obliging part of me can't help but feel that they are just being kind and that my suggestion was just not in line with local norms. And ultimately I wanna be respectful of those norms and not send the signal that it's me being cheap or lazy or not caring enough. 

I mention considerations about the cost despite being a straight woman because my frame of mind going into it is that it's 50/50 - usually that's never the case though because guy offers to pay for my share but I stick to this to never have the mindset that someone else owes me something, ever. It's a dangerous slope to get on and yes i'M noT likE thE oThEr gIrLs (insert spongebobmeme.jpg). 

I also don't see the point of spending more than Ya Kun or Toast Box or on the upper end, the average meal at Song Fa for a first date, unless both of you are damn sure that the vibes click and the first date at that point is more of a formality than actually evaluating each other seriously, and you're 100% certain you will see this person again even before you've gone on that first date. 

The long and short of it is that I'm just so sick of angmoh food, but I'm also not someone who places a lot of emphasis on atmosphere as it's the company and quality of the conversation that ultimately trumps everything. What's the best way to navigate this? Am I doing something weird or okay to proceed as it is? ",1,1768165861.0,sgdatingscene,0,1.0,False

1qab5x0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1qab5x0/i_just_finished_watching_stranger_things/,I just finished watching Stranger Things,"I agree that Will's coming out scene was... it felt like ""A very special episode"" It felt off... but it didn't ruin the season for me.... I half expected Vecna to be there, just silently nodding and smiling without lips.

Secondly.... they set the mountain sized spider on fire, stabbed its pus sacks, aimed at a weak point, and essentially gave Vecna constipation while El spiked him like a football. And Wynona Ryder went whole ham on his neck with a blunt axe. So that was fun.

Overall.... It was a rare experience, touching on my own childhood in certain ways, and I will be honest here.... The three Demodogs getting pop tarted in the laundry room was a bit sad, like they were just being entertained! and then, boop! they done gone did the boom.

Eddies scene, while impactful, left the question of ""what other songs would have been epic?"" 1. King Nothing, 2. Rock version of never ending story, and numerous other options. The exotic matter.... felt like Vecno was craving smores and made everything out of smores and spiders.

Max hiding out in Henrys Trauma was hilarious, and Will being all ""NOW YOU'RE PLAYING WITH POWER!"" on him was kind of funny. They really could've done more with that seen.

The fact that John, Steve, Robin, and Nancy esentially breakfast clubbed was good. And the last shot of the boys popping their character books on the shelf must've been heart wrenching as they each walked up with steps. You can tell that some of the dialogue the duffers wrote for hopper made the guy face what he did in the past, wit hthe rumours of bugging Millie a little too much? He was feeling it.

What... got me thinking was that, there wasn't really any opportunity to have a day with Henry, get to know him a bit more when he wasn't being the creepy milkman for Psychonauts. Just be like ""Hey, I'm grabbing a burger, come with me, I got questions!""

I'm really tired.... so if anything makes sense, awesome.... time for sleep.

\*\*five hours of a lseep later\*\*

Now that I've had some sleep, a redbull, a cup of coffee, souls of the LSD addicted portion of the river stix, and a single cinnamon gummy bear, let's dive into this, shall we?

First off, going into the first season was a hard watch for me, I tried watching the first episode back when it came out, and... watching a bunch of kids squeak their way through slice of life stuff seemed too slow. But... then psychic orphan annie popped up and started her nose bleed powers and I was like, ""Okay, we'll see what happens.""

I felt like I was watching childhood in fast forward, reliving the momentous freedoms of the 80's and 90's back when I was a kid. Watching saturday morning cartoons, eating cereal from the box/tupperware container, listening to synthpop music and watching MTV back when music television really was king.. The stories of Mike, Will, Dustin, and Lucas reminded me of my own childhood friend group, Blake, Bobby, Daniel, and myself. We'd spend time at Blake's house playing Dungeons and dragons, eating pizza, drinking coke, and playing modded versions of FF7 where Cloud was a frog that did 1 damage to a ghost boat monster in a casino.  
God bless Game Shark, you cursed, cursed tool.

Jim, Joyce, Murray, and the others, including Ted weren't the focus of the show, yes, yes, yes, they were important and provided various pillars, but we all know that the focus was squarely on the boys, the girls, and Henry the lipless hententacle monster.  
Hop reminded me of a few father figures in my life, gruff, short worded, doing the best they could with what they had, but underneath the armor of it all... All the battles, victories, and losses, Hop was a guiding force, a hairy, hairy, demodog and russian chewtoy of a guiding force. He was scarred from his daughters lost fight with cancer, and he transferred that sense of duty over to Jane. He eventually healed enough and grew enough to figure out what and who he wanted, and it was lydia deetz. I mean Joyce byers.

Joyce, like the other mothers... and Ted, were support characters until the moment they weren't, except for Ted.  
Dude took a 9 iron to a demogorgon fight and was side swiped harder then Jake Pauls make a wish chin.  
Joyce, to me, is a secret badass, the absolute end boss that Vecna had to face. It wasn't the combo attack from the Squawkers, it was the metnal game of ""peek a book I impale you"" that Jane/El played with him, it wasn't the absolute beast mode fireplace poker to the face that Holly delivered, nor was it the uno reverse that William pulled on him, yes, they all helped. But the duffers knew what they were doing writing this scene.  
Would it have been cathartic had all the boys moms had their moment to shine in the end, and did it feel like Lucas, Dustin, and Will's moms got a bit shafted? Yes, just a bit. Dustin's mom remind's me of Blake Mother, she was no nonsense, loved her son to pieces, and was incredibly bubbly to no end in sight. But the thought of all the bubbly goodness dissappearing in the blink of an eye as all four mothers, armed with axes, and pent up rage, focused squarely on Vecnas pinned the tail on the fleshy spike butt?

Pure, epic cinema.

Billy, and Eddie... I wanted so badly to live. The dynamic and empathetic dualities of their personalities, each coup\[led with their own traumas, felt as though they shouldn't have been sacrificial pieces in the Duffers magnum opus, not minor characters, but pillars which could've been put through some additional circles, maybe as still living vessels, each fighting to return to normalcy amidst internally while external forces guided their unwilling hands. But, we know not the minds of those who craft these fine artifacts of entertainment for us.  
Billy... was the passive agressive brother who took things too far, and ended up paying a price he never knew until it was too late. Maybe I didn't feel anything for him at first, but the revelations of a happy childhood and the abusive nature of the high pressures that his father placed on him drove him towards passing that same treatment down to max. His infection, and the fear on his face, told more of his inner workings than any fan theories could ever. His sacrifice, and rebellion at the end of his arc, felt as though it were a rainbow i nthe dark, that most appreciative and deservive ""Here I am, rock you like a hurricane!"" moment of fortune favoring the bold.

Eddie's arc, from master of the Hellfire club, rebellious spifire of a soul, to traumatized falsely accused survivor, to hunted down percieved fugitive, to epic rock soloist, to his final self sacrifce sacrifice, it was... a gust of wind gently blowing against a fragile flame which had previously burned a whole forest down. and it was glorious to watch.

Maxine, Jane, Nancy, Robin, Erica, Holly... These girls were written with the differing personalities and depth their characters deserved, and the actresses played the hell out of those characters with all they had.

Jane's origins from stolen baby to stolen childhood, to test subject, to groomed by ""Mr. Rogers if he were secretly creepy Santa Clause"", not to mention Henry ""I am the milkman, and the milk is me"" Creel's lessons.... it all felt a little... too much.  
But, she went from stunted and blunted logic girl to an absolute powerhouse doing everything she could to free herself from the nature of his origins and abilities. Her journey was that of epic classic heriones, from start to finish, and the more obvious portions of her humanity, the need for connection, the evolution of her blossoming, and the breaking away from the standards with the help of Max, helped crafted an ending that felt appropriate.

Erica.... gave zero shits, she was by far my favorite character, and I wonder if her actress brought that power and natural charisma naturally has to the role? Or... was it just her exploration of the character itself at the time of filming that brought it out? Her journey with erica... I wonder if it had some lasting impacts as to the external off screen intellectual persuits?  
Erica herself... She was a pain in the butt to every antagonist, and it wasn't until Dustin readjusted her viewpoints that she really shone in her journey.  
Family is still family, after all, regardless of the origin.

Max.... as a red head myself, was accurate to a fault line. Male or female, all red heads share a single trait, fiction or no, we're all head strong pains in the butts that stop at nothing to achieve our goals, whatever and where ever they may lead.

1qab32d,https://www.reddit.com/r/RezeCult/comments/1qab32d/chainsaw_man_and_tokyo_ghoul/,Chainsaw man and Tokyo Ghoul,"Interestingly, Fujimoto Tasuki admits Tokyo Ghoul and Sui Ishida is one of the influences for his work, and there are clear parallels with that and Chainsaw man.

* **Reze: Rize or Touka?**

Aside from the core difference that Kaneki's education and literary background make him think widely and philosophically compared to Denji, the heroines have a clear similarity.

So in Tokyo Ghoul, the main love interests for Kaneki were Rize and Touka. Reze shares certain similarities with both Rize and Touka, such as having darker purple hair like Rize and sharing a similar name. On the other hand, being a waitress, having a eye-covering hairstyle, having a dark past and general ""teachings"", and the level of love and emotional connection resemble Touka much more than Reze. Thus, the element of teaching is constantly vital in the story, along with ""coffee"" as a symbol, even though it is one of the foods for ghouls. If you look at the Reze arc, her teaching of Denji about a normal life is very similar to what Touka does, and the part when she teaches about fighting as a hybrid further makes her more similar to Touka.

As you know, Touka is the one who gets married to Kaneki eventually. Touka plays a vital role in making Kaneki settle into a Ghoul's life during part 1, even though Kaneki has to part from her temporarily. She sets up a cafe in Re:, but Kaneki does not have the memory as Kaneki Ken, the ghoul until the middle of part 2. However, recovering the memory and Touka's confession leads to an explosive scene and pregnancy. This is where I see semblance between the entire dynamic, as Denji and Reze both think of each other as important people in their lives despite being physically parted during arcs. Again, the background for the reunion is set up as the relationship clearly resembles Kaneki and Touka's storyline.

* **Then how could part 2 flow?**

At this stage, we know Reze is closer to Touka, but that doesn't prove anything for now. So let's continue to observe the characters. What I aim to highlight is that Rize isn't actually the primary influence for Reze. In fact, her traits also resemble Makima's, as both serve as a first love who becomes very predatory, sharing similar elegant yet childish physical and emotional traits.

However, we have neglected one more character that loves Kaneki and who appears in Tokyo Ghoul: Re, which is Tooru Mutsuki. Tooru spends much more time with Kaneki like Asa does in part 2, which makes romantic feelings from her side to emerge. The amount of time together is disproportionately larger than Touka until Kaneki reclaims his memory. What I found surprising was that, like Denji and Asa, who share their past of hating their parents and killing them, Kaneki and Touro also share that story of getting bullied by their parents. Even though Kaneki did not kill his mother, that is the point where they bond the most in the entire series.

Now the intriguing part is that Touro does start to love Kaneki, as she feels sympathy for him and understands his pain. In terms of sheer comparisons, she is most like Kaneki, and this is why I suspect Asa's motive somehwat originates from her. Her interactions with Owl and, more crucially, her battles with Touka aptly illustrate this. During her fight with Touka, Touro becomes extremely angry when Touka refers to Kaneki as her ""husband"", and she attempts to kill the baby inside Touka; however, her allies, who Kaneki was using to fight the final boss, stop her. It is also interesting that Kaneki has only platonic feelings for her sorrows, but they never become romantic. (Kaneki's education and principles do help, though.) So ultimately Touro's Asa + Yoru behaviour does not make her end up with Kaneki, and she even tries to obtain Kaneki by betraying him temporarily in part 2.

Since Tasuki believes that love is an explosion, Tokyo Ghoul serves as an intriguing comparison for Denji's three past potential love interests: Makima, Reze, and Asa. If the dynamics work like it happened in Tokyo Ghoul, then I must say Reze still has a good chance, as the story is similar yet somewhat different to",7,1768165642.0,RezeCult,0,1.0,False

1qab2wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/gumball/comments/1qab2wb/eww_the_awkwardness/,EWW: The Awkwardness,"Hello and welcome to episode 142 in a series inspired by u/kamikazeb0y and CinemaSins, where I'll be sinning each and every episode of Gumball!

Quick Disclaimer: I know this is just a children's cartoon and isn't meant to be taken seriously. This, like the show itself, is not at all meant to be taken seriously or considered an actual critique of the show. It is all in good fun.

With that out of the way I present you, Everything Wrong With: The Awkwardness!

**Okay, firstly, did we** ***really*** **need a sequel to The Hug that does nothing but re-use the same old ""lol Gumball is really awkward around Hot Dog Guy"" joke for another 11 minutes and literally nothing more? Especially in the** ***same fucking season,*** **only** ***ten*** **episode later??**[**?**](https://www.wattpad.com/user/?) **You couldn'r have at** ***least*** **waited until Season 5? This just screams ""the writers ran out of ideas so just re-used a previous episode's premise, made a pseudo-sequel, and calle dit a day +5**

**Also tf is this episode's synopsis? ""Gumball is walking in the same direction as Hot Dog Guy, and with each step it becomes increasingly awkward.""? That barely tells us anything about the actual ep.** 

**Like, damn, even the synopsis couldn't find a way to properly differentiate this from The Hug +5**

**Also also, didn't Gumball and Hot Dog Guy resolve their awkwardness at the end of last episode? Why are they suddenly awkward with each other again?? +5**

**Okay okay, enough pre-episode ranting. Let's actually get into the episode already.**

*\[Gumball opens the fridge to find an empty ketchup bottle\]*  
**Gumball**: *\[Groans\]*  
*\[Gumball raps about ketchup as he makes his way through the neighborhood\]*  
**Gumball**: *On my way to buy some ketchup, I'm feeling pretty good.*  
**Can't you just use some other sauce? I mean, by the time you get home with the ketchup your hot dog will be cold +1**

**Gumball:** *Ketchup is my favorite sauce, it is the condiment of kings!*  
**Really? Ketchup? That's literally the most boring choice possible. There's so many other sauces that are more flavorful and interesting that tomato suace. BBQ Sauce, Mustard, Mayo, Brown Sauce, Hot Sauce. Ketchup is literally the most mild and bland one out there +1**

**Gumball:** *You can use it on a burger, or spaghetti Bolognese.*  
**Your italian ancestors are writhing in horror in the grave right now. What the fuck dude +1**

**Gumball:** *You can use it to clean your ears or even wash your face!*  
**...no you cannot. Unless you consider smudging red goop over your face and in your ears 'clean' +1**

**Gumball:** *On pizza, pasta, chops, or cookies as a main or on the side.*  
**Dude, each food you listed just made things worse and worse. Ketchup on bolognese is one thing, but pizza? Chops?** ***Cookies?*** **What are you, a pregnant woman?? +1**

**Gumball:** *As hair gel, salad dressing, or to grease a slip-and-slide.*  
**Okay I'll give you the slip and slide one, and** ***maybe*** **salad dressing even though it's a little weird. But hair gel??? Dude I am now actively concerned for your hygiene +1**

**Gumball:** *It's good for steak, cake, coffee break, roast hake,*  
**It is good for none of those things. +1**

**Gumball:** *a pasta bake! If you drink some in the morning it'll make you feel awake!*  
**Wha- you** ***drink*** **it too?? I don't know who's more obsessed with ketchup at this point, you or Ash's pikachu. +1**

**Gumball:** *On fries, shish kebab, on bacon, crab, or toast, you can fry it, steam it,*  
**Well done, it took you eight lines into the rap to actually say something that isn't weird or gross. Took a while, but you got there -1**

**Gumball:** *On meats, beets, cheese, wheat, sweets, and treats*  
**And you immediately lost the streak. Ketchup on sweets and treats? The fuck is wrong with you, genuinely?? +1**

**Gumball:** it\*'s not just there for you to eat, when dried, it works like\* [*concrete.To*](http://concrete.To) *shine your boots, on veg, on fruits, to clean your shirts, your socks, your suits, to lubricate a creaky door, to clean your teeth, to clean a floor, to paint a painting you have painted, revive old ladies who fainted, to give your quiche a little lift*  
**Okay genuinely what are you even rambling on about at this point? You're just making shit up to try and continue the song at this point +5**

**Also, tf does ""paint a painting you have painted"" even mean? +1**

**Gumball:** *it's always guaranteed to make an awesome fake nose bleed.*  
**Okay, finally something that's objectively true and makes sense +5**

**Gumball:** *But my favorite use for ketchup's not on fries or roasted hog, where I love ketchup most is on a big juicy hot dog—*  
*\[While Gumball is rapping, he is interrupted by Hot Dog Guy bumping into him, who drops his phone\]*  
**Hot Dog Guy just so happens to bump into Gumball** ***right*** **as he's talking about big juicy hot dogs. Either the universe hates him, or Gumball is just the unluckiest person on planet Earth +1**

**Also, massive kudos to Jacob Hopkins here. It** ***cannot*** **have been easy to rap at such a high speed like Gumball was here. Dude has some insane skill -5**

*\[Both Gumball and Hot Dog Guy start groaning in an awkward silence. They try to pick up the phone but accidentally hold hands, startled, they leap out before both trying again and pushing their faces together by mishap\]*  
**Why is Gumball trying to pick up the phone? It's Hot Dog Guy's phone, just let him pick it up himself +1**

**Gumball**: *\[Monologue\]* *Okay. The only way we get out of sync...*  
**Hot Dog Guy**​​​​: *\[Monologue\]* *...is if I say something really unexpected like:*  
**Both**: Business clown! Meat flan! Thunder quack!  
**Okay, how the fuck did both of them happening to think of the exact three same phrases? Are they psychic or something?? +1**

*\[They accidentally walk in the same direction and, nervously trying to break sync, simultaneously and continuously step forwards and backwards\]*  
**Okay, the two are so in sync it's genuinely getting kind of creepy now. +1**

*\[The stoplight turns green. Cuts to the two walking but coming to a stop when a group of children run their way, blocking them, they both sigh and wait impatiently for several moments, though eventually notice the same children have been running around them repetitively\]*  
**Gumball**: Wait a minute!  
**Darn, just as I about to call out the animators for being lazy and re-using the same toddler models over and over. You win this time, Gumball crew -1**

**Though wait, why are a bunch of toddler crossing the street and running around completely on their own? Where are Patrick, Judith or Penny and the other toddlers guardians? +1**

**Child**: Playing tag!  
*\[The children break the loop and start running on the sidewalk before all bumping one by one into a fence\]*  
**Gumball isn't the slightest bit worried about Polly, his girlfriends' sister, being alone in the middle of town, nor about her getting hurt here +5**

**Both**: Hopefully I'll never see his face—  
*\[They accidentally meet as they come to a bus stop.\]*  
**Okay, at this point I'd just give up and go home. It's not worth enduring this awkwardness just for a bit of ketchup dude +1**

*\[Hot Dog Guy walks away. The bus arrives, stuffed with passengers\]*  
*\[Gumball tries to make his way through the bus, grunting, apologizing, and pushing a passenger out of the bus through a window in the process by pressure\]*  
*\[Scene cuts to Hot Dog Guy's bus stop, the same bus arrives\]*  
**Gumball**: *\[Breathing heavily, sweating\]* Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot... *\[Starts blowing air in Hot Dog Guy's direction\]*  
**Dude, at this point you only have yourself to blame for getting into these awkward situations. I mean, if** ***I*** **see a bus that full I'm either walking away or just waiting for the next one +1**

**Also Judith tf are you doing here?? Go attend your toddler who's out wandering the streets unsupervised! +1**

**Gumball**: Still thirsty though.  
*\[Hot Dog Guy suddenly bumps into him out of nowhere\]*  
**Gumball**: Hey! This is my private happy place! What are you doing here?  
**Okay, dude can even enter Gumball's inner thoughts now? Maybe they really are psychic +1**

**Gumball**: *\[Sighs\]* Who am I kidding, the elevator is one of the most awkward places on the planet. Right up there with the school locker room, dinner with your girlfriend's father, and dinner with your girlfriend's father in the school locker room.  
*\[The elevator doors open. The two walk inside, unnerved\]*  
**If the elevator is the most awkward place on Earth why are you using it? Just use the stairs instead you lazy bum +1**

*\[After some nervous silence, Hot Dog Guy takes his phone out of his jacket. Gumball, slightly annoyed, imitates him and his phone's sounds. Hot Dog Guy turns to Gumball, wondering what the latter is doing. Gumball casually moves his hand to the back of his head and the other to his hip, pretending he didn't do anything. They both then quit their acts resignedly\]*  
**Why not just...actually take out your phone too? Unless you left it at home, by the fuck would you do that? +1**

*\[In slow-motion, they're both about to press the same button\]*  
**Gumball**: *\[Slow-motion\]* Not *this* time! *\[Withdraws his hand, changing its direction\]* Ha ha ha! *\[Continues laughing as his finger accidentally derails into his eye, and his laughing becomes a long yelp of pain\]*  
**I mean, still better than awkwardly touching his finger again +1**

*\[Gumball glances towards the panel, which is showing the elevator moving at decimal numbers\]*  
**Gumball**: Come on! Come on!  
*\[Gumball presses the button repetitively, and the elevator stops abruptly\]*  
**The two awkward people happen to get stuck in an elevator together. How totally not predictable! +5**

**Gumball**: I'll start! I've got like a weird nail at the end of my tail. Look. *\[Moves the fur on the end of his tail to reveal the end of a finger on his tail\]*  
**Ew, what in the actual fuck? +1**

**Also how did Gumball get born with a human finger on his tail as a birth defect? I man, neither Nicole nor Richard have any human DNA, nor were any of their ancestors human from what we saw much later on in The Cheerleader +1**

*\[The elevator doors open suddenly\]*  
**Both**: *\[Gasp\]*  
**Tobias**​​​​​: *\[Holding up both a phone and his other hand\]* Don't worry, I didn't take any pictures.  
**Both**: *\[Sigh\]*  
**Tobias**​​​​​: *\[Chuckles\]* It was a video!  
**A video of what? The door opening and twso people standing in an elevator? Oh my, how scandolous! +1**

**Also why was he recording before the doors even opened? Was he just hoping that something interesting would be in the elevator? +1**

**Also also, didn't the elevator stop? How did they arrive at their floor? +5**

**Gumball**: Finally.​ A some place where I won't-  
**Hot Dog Guy**​​​​: *\[Busts inside the same cubicle as Gumball's\]* —bump into that guy again!  
**Okay, seriously, at this point the universe has to be fucking with them for shits and giggles. There's no other explanation for it +5**

**Gumball**: *\[Disgusted\]* Why do you have to make everything so awkward?  
**Hot Dog Guy**​​​​: Me?  
*\[They start to walk up the wall\]*  
**Gumball**: You're the one who's haplessly awkward!  
**Hot Dog Guy**​​​​: I'm not hapless, I'm totally hapfull man!  
**Gumball**: That's not even a word. Look, how about we just pretend this is all normal?

*\[Leonard Daniels stands in front of the cubicle where Gumball and Hot Dog Guy are\]*  
**Hot Dog Guy**​​​​: *\[Off-screen\]* Ok, it's just a hot dog and a blue cat climbing on a public toilet using only their feet. Nothing weird here.  
**Aaaand with that line you just proved Gumball right. And only a few sentences later too. Dude, please, just shut up +1**

**Gumball**: *\[Rapping\]*  
*Finally I got rid of that annoying Hot dog Guy.*  
*Now I'm in the store so there is no reason why.*  
*He can interrupt my day so I'll tell you all what's up*

1qab16n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1qab16n/i_audited_my_apartment_for_endocrine_disruptors/,I audited my apartment for Endocrine Disruptors. Here are the 5 items I threw out immediately to fix my hormones.,"I’ve been diving deep into the statistics around male testosterone dropping \~50% since the 1950s, and while diet/sleep are obvious factors, the environmental aspect is often ignored.

We are constantly exposed to **Xenoestrogens,** synthetic chemicals that mimic estrogen in the body, bind to receptors, and crush natural production. I spent the last few months auditing my apartment to remove these endocrine disruptors.

Here are the 5 most common ""Testosterone Killers"" that were sitting in my home, and what I replaced them with.

# 1. The Non-Stick Pan (Teflon/PFAS)

That convenient non-stick frying pan was the first thing to go. When heated, the coating (PTFE) breaks down and releases per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) into food.

These are known as ""Forever Chemicals"" because the body cannot easily excrete them. Studies have directly linked PFAS exposure to lower testosterone levels and smaller testicular volume in men.

**The Swap:** I threw out anything labeled ""Non-stick"" or ""Teflon."" I replaced them with Cast Iron and Stainless Steel. Yes, they are harder to clean, but scrubbing a pan is better than scrubbing your hormones.

# 2. Polyester Underwear

This is the silent killer. 90% of modern men's underwear is made from Polyester, Nylon, or Elastane. These are plastic-based fabrics.

Plastic is an insulator. It traps heat. By wearing plastic underwear, you create a greenhouse effect around your testicles. Your scrotum is designed to hang away from the body to keep the testicles 2-3 degrees cooler than your core temperature—this is required for optimal sperm and testosterone production. Polyester disrupts this thermoregulation.

Additionally, the friction of polyester generates an electrostatic field which has been shown in animal studies to suppress T-levels.

**The Swap:** I got rid of anything with more than 5% synthetic fabric. I switched to 100% Cotton or Merino Wool boxers (loose fitting).

# 3. The Plastic Kettle & Coffee Pods

I used to wake up, put a plastic pod into a machine, force boiling water through it, and drink the result. Or boil water in a plastic electric kettle.

**Heat + Plastic = Poison.** When you heat plastic, it leaches phthalates and bisphenols (BPA/BPS) into the liquid. You are essentially drinking a ""microplastic tea"" every morning. These chemicals are potent endocrine disruptors.

**The Swap:** I switched to a glass kettle (ensuring the lid isn't plastic) and now use a Stainless Steel Moka Pot or French Press instead of plastic pods.

# 4. Thermal Receipts

This sounds paranoid, but the science is solid. Thermal paper receipts (the shiny ones you get at the grocery store) are coated in free BPA or BPS.

Unlike the BPA in hard plastics, this BPA is ""free,"" meaning it is not bound to a polymer. It absorbs through the skin instantly. One study showed that holding a receipt for just 5 seconds can transfer significant amounts of BPA into the bloodstream. If you use hand sanitizer before touching it, the absorption increases by 100x.

**The Protocol:** I decline the receipt. If I must take it, I hold it by the very edge (the non-printed side) and wash my hands immediately after. I never put them in my pocket.

# 5. Scented Candles and Air Fresheners

That ""Ocean Breeze"" smell isn't real. It is a chemical cocktail stabilized by **Phthalates**.

Phthalates are used to make scents linger longer. They are also well-documented anti-androgens (substances that block testosterone). When you burn a scented candle, you are vaporizing these chemicals and inhaling them directly into your bloodstream via the lungs.

**The Swap:** I threw out the Glade plug-ins and cheap candles. I switched to 100% Beeswax candles or essential oil diffusers (using organic oils).

**Summary** You cannot out-train a toxic environment. You can lift weights 6 days a week and eat steak, but if you are marinating your cells in estrogen-mimicking chemicals, you are fighting a losing battle.

I have a longer write-up on this where I go into the specific brands I used for the swaps and the supplement stack for detoxing the liver, but this covers the main household offenders.

Ever since she's come into my life, I've experienced so many new things (especially in food since she loves eating). I'm a typical middle-class guy from a tier-2 city - not poor, not incapable of affording things like Starbucks, but I always preferred momos with friends over expensive coffee. I never really saw the point.

This New Year's, when we were out celebrating with friends, I casually mentioned I was thirsty. She suggested trying a Starbucks refresher since there was a store nearby. I was hesitant (didn't see the point of spending that much on what I assumed was watered-down juice), but she ordered it for me anyway. And honestly, it was genuinely refreshing and way better than I expected.

What meant even more was that she's only recently started earning through gig work, and we're still college students - so her spending her own money on a small treat for me meant a lot.

1qaax0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qaax0m/im_the_one_who_sold_the_night_lights/,I'm the One Who Sold The Night Lights,"I’ve rinsed the bitter taste of police station coffee out of my mouth, but it doesn’t help. Morning mist settles over the Ozarks, and I can’t stop thinking about those poor families.


I work at the Ridgemont General Store, past the gas station on Oxford Street where that biker got shot, if you saw the news article. People often miss it, nestled amongst the pine trees. The area is so quiet, you can hear the electronics buzz.


The night lights arrived in an unmarked cardboard box. Collected and signed for by the day shift attendant, I assumed. I didn't think there was anything odd about the delivery; it's the kind of item a tired parent might desperately search a store for when trying to get their kids to sleep. They emit white noise that's meant to be soothing.


I sold them for about two weeks until I got a call. Not many--maybe four or five of the lights.


""Where do you get off selling this shit? Do you even check?"" a lady yelled through the line.


""No, I'm just a clerk."" I told her. ""If it's about a faulty item, don't stress. I'll organise a refund."" 


""What I want is my damn kid to go to sleep. He's terrified.""


She said it worked fine at first. Her kid giggled when the egg-shaped bulb lit up, and the white noise calmed his crying. Later that night, she passed his room on the way to the bathroom and found him kneeling in front of the light, talking to it. When she asked him what he was doing, he only said,


“Can I sleep with you tonight?”


We received plenty of complaints, and many we had no way of verifying. Kids have imaginary friends. They talk to themselves. I noted the complaint but wasn't particularly bothered.


Once inventory was done, I had nothing to do during my night shifts other than listen to podcasts. I unboxed one of the night lights and connected it to the socket next to the store counter. As advertised in the information slip, the device released a faint, static buzz. I figured that's all the kid heard--voices in static.


About two hours into my shift, the static made a sudden click. The audio shifted to something more akin to waves pulling in and out, or a jogger who's out of breath. I leaned in closer, and heard the voice.


“Meet me outside,” it said. “Those aren't your parents. They're here, with me.” For a moment, I just gaped at the light, feeling dizzy. ""I can hear you breathing. You can trust me, I'm a police officer. We listen to every house in this neighborhood. To protect you.""


My lips didn't move--I couldn't speak.


Someone had remote access to the light. Someone who thought I was a kid, because only children are afraid of the dark.


I ripped the device from the socket and let it clatter on the linoleum floor. If they were meeting me outside, that meant they were tracking the device. I raised my foot, ready to stomp.


But I stopped.


Maybe he was nearby--maybe he was already here. Maybe he'd done this before. I'd sold half a dozen of those lights--to real families. If this was real, I needed to know.


I reconnected the light, and whispered in a small voice ""Okay.""


Not long after, headlights crested a hill and a car came prowling down the road. An ordinary sedan, the kind that drives past all the time. It slowed down once it got to the store. The window rolled down; a gap just small enough for their eyes.


Then it took off.


Faster than I could whip out my phone and take a photo of the number plate. Plus, it was too dark.


I knew why immediately; they'd been expecting a house, not a store.


I spoke with Mike from the day shift. He had no idea what I was talking about. He never collected a delivery.


The police are aware and are investigating the missing children.


To whoever I sold the night lights to, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. ",10,1768165249.0,nosleep,0,0.92,False

It’s a place where you can work from a modern café in the morning, then be snorkeling, diving, or chasing waterfalls by the weekend.

Here’s what living and working from Cebu City is really like 👇



# 🏙️ The Vibe: Busy City, Island at Heart

Cebu City is the **second-largest metro in the Philippines**, but it doesn’t feel overwhelming. The city has malls, offices, hospitals, coworking spaces, and international restaurants — yet you’re never far from the sea.

* Weekdays = city life, cafés, coworking, meetings
* Weekends = beaches, diving, island hopping, road trips
* Mix of locals, expats, students, and remote workers

Think **Manila-lite** with way better access to nature.



# 💻 Remote Work Setup in Cebu

Cebu is one of the **most practical cities in the Philippines for remote work**.

# Internet & Workspaces

* Fiber internet widely available in the city
* Coworking spaces in IT Park, Business Park, and central areas
* Cafés with Wi-Fi are common (especially in IT Park & Lahug)
* Mobile data is cheap and useful as a backup

Compared to smaller islands, Cebu is far more reliable for video calls and deadlines.



# 💸 Cost of Living (Approx.)

Cebu is affordable, especially compared to Western cities — but more expensive than small islands like Siargao.

* 🏠 Apartment (1BR): $400–800/month
* ☕ Coffee: $2–4
* 🍽 Local meals: $2–5
* 🛵 Motorbike taxi / Grab: very cheap

You can live comfortably on a **moderate nomad budget** without sacrificing convenience.



# 🏖️ Beaches & Nature (This Is the Big Win)

One of Cebu’s biggest advantages is **location**.

Within **1–3 hours**, you can reach:

* 🏝️ Mactan Island beaches
* 🐠 Moalboal (sardine run + diving)
* 🏖️ Bantayan Island (white sand, chill vibes)
* 🌊 Kawasan Falls
* 🐋 Whale sharks in Oslob

It’s one of the best bases in the Philippines if you want **urban comfort + constant access to nature**.



# 🍜 Food & Lifestyle

Cebu has:

* Excellent Filipino food (lechon capital of the Philippines 🐷)
* International options (Japanese, Korean, Western)
* Night markets and food courts
* Big malls for daily life and errands

English is widely spoken, which makes daily life extremely easy for nomads.

# ⚠️ Honest Downsides

Cebu isn’t perfect — here’s the real talk:

* Traffic can be heavy during rush hours
* Hot and humid climate year-round
* Some neighborhoods are noisy or chaotic
* Pollution and infrastructure can feel messy in places

Choosing the **right area** to live makes a huge difference.

To get that ""sickly"" look quickly, I used the Slapchop method combined with specific Army Painter Speed Paints 2.0 to filter the colors over a zenithal prime.
 The Recipe:

Prep: Started with a heavy drybrush/zenithal of white over black to establish values.
Base Skin: Coated the model in Maggot Skin to get that necrotic green/yellow hue.
Inflammation: Used Murder Scene on the open sores and extremities to create the look of raw flesh.
Bruising: Glazed Hive Dweller Purple into the deepest recesses and shadow areas to add volume and a bruised effect.
Pustules: Hit the boils and highest points with Pastel Yellow to make them pop.
After the Speed Paints dried, I went back in with Pro Acryl paints to smooth out the blends and push the highlights even further.  Speed Paints are great for the base, adding standard acrylics on top is what removes that ""stained"" look and adds real volume.
Refining the Flesh: I used Pro Acryl Tan Flesh to layer over the green skin. This smoothed out the coffee-staining from the wash and made the skin look taut and solid.
The ""Pop"": For the final disgusting details, I used Pro Acryl Bright Ivory. I applied this as a dot highlight on the pustules.

1. If she allowed coffee to be in fodland she would absolutely invent iced coffee due to the fact she actually dislikes hot drinks 

2. It’s hard for her to be drunk but if you somehow succeed in getting her to that point she is a scary drunk. Like to the point where she terrified Hubert 

3. Is one of the few people who actually liked alois dad jokes to the chagrin of everyone

The TV was on. Low. Muted maybe. I don’t know. The apartment smelled like burnt coffee and old socks. Something metallic too. I thought it was a dream.

I grabbed my phone. Locked. No notifications. When I unlocked it, every photo, every contact, every text was someone else’s. Faces staring at me. Not in the photos, at me. I don’t know how to explain it.

A message from Mom said why are you in our apartment again

I tried calling my own number. A man answered. Stop. You’re not him

I ran. Hallway wasn’t mine. Every apartment number had my name. I pressed my ear to one door. Someone slept inside. Wearing my face. My chest rose and fell the same way mine does. I don’t know how I didn’t scream.

I slammed it shut. My phone buzzed. Notification said we know where you are

I ran down the stairs. Outside the street was empty. Every window reflected me. Watching. Smiling. Waiting.

Buildings were wrong. Shadows were wrong. A street sign flickered and spelled my name backwards.

Then I remembered the beta app I installed last week. Sync memories across devices it promised. I didn’t think anything would happen. Maybe this is the experiment and I’m the test

Then a vibration in my hand. My phone lit up by itself. Caller ID said Yourself

I answered. My own voice whispered sync incomplete please remain still

I ran. Streets shifted under my feet twisting like the world was breathing. A child waved from the corner. Wearing my face. Blink. Gone. Air smelled like coffee socks metal.

1qaamso,https://i.redd.it/tzb029rvtrcg1.jpeg,Review: Lyre's Bourbon Alternative (formerly American Malt),"For 2026 I've decided to set myself on a mission to flesh out a home NA bar, so naturally that means doing some comparative tastings on everything I might need. Bourbon is typically my go-to when I'm not not drinking, so it seemed like a natural place to start.

Obviously these reviews are going to be subjective, but I'm going to try to keep them as consistent  as I can. Plan is to taste each spirit neat, then evaluate how it performs amongst a set of 10 cocktails classic to the intended style. Cocktails will be standardized to a 1floz portion of the spirit, and I'll list ingredients and ratios for each.

# Lyre's Bourbon Alternative (formerly American Malt)

**From the Producer:**

“Lyre’s Bourbon Alternative is a premium non-alcoholic bourbon-style spirit with notes of caramel, vanilla and cedary oak. Smooth, gently spiced and impossibly crafted for classic whiskey cocktails. Mellow caramel and vanilla layered with toasted nuts, sweet spice and charred cedary oak, finishing smooth and gently spiced.”

**Ingredients:**

Water, Glucose Syrup, Caramel Syrup E150D, Natural Flavours, Acidity Regulator (Phosphoric Acid), Stabiliser (Cellulose Gum), Preservative (Potassium Sorbate, Potassium Benzoate), Sweetener Steviol Glycosides

  
**Availability:**

# TLDR

Lyre's Bourbon Alternative scores an average 2.36/10. In both the best performing and worst performing cocktails, the spirit plays an absolutely minimal role in the end product. Any amount of strong flavoring, sweetening, or acidification is enough to hide the spirit entirely. **Bottom Line:** Don't waste your money on this. If you're itching for Bourbon, this ain't it.

**Neat - 3/10**

Appearance: 1/1 - Copper to caramel in color, high clarity, low viscosity/body

Nose: 1/3  - Artificial caramel, some sherry-like notes, not a lot of depth

Palate: 0/3 - Very watery, artificial caramel up front with some notes of black tea. No attempt being made at replicating alcohol “burn”.

Finish: 1/2  - Long, dry finish that doesn’t go anywhere or evolve.

Balance: 0/3 - Bitters are doing the heavy lifting, no real sweetness

Expression: 0/3 - spirit character is fully lost when mixed

Bitters + Vermouth: 1/2 - Both dominate the whiskey, and it's like they're fighting for attention.

Texture: 0/1 - Body hasn't been improved from the base spirit, still just very watery

Finish + Aftertaste: 0/1 Doesn’t linger, but the dry finish is also gone.



[**Old Fashioned**](https://imbibemagazine.com/recipe/old-fashioned-cocktail-recipe/) **- 3/10** (.5floz Rich Syrup, 1/8tsp All The Bitter Old Fashioned Aromatic Bitters)

Whiskey Forwardness: 0/3 - all character masked by sweetness

Balance: 0/3 - straight up sugar bomb, like Grade A Maple almost

Integration: 1/2 - bitters come forward, only briefly and only at the very end

Texture + Dilution: 1/1 - **needs** to be properly diluted

Finish + Evolution: 1/1 - finish is really lengthened with the syrup, and the flavor lingers just as long.

[**Highball**](https://punchdrink.com/recipes/japanese-whisky-highball/) **- 2/10** (2floz chilled Soda Water)

Refreshment: 1/3 - slightly less refreshing than soda water on it’s own

Whiskey Presence: 1/3 - Lengthening it this way really brings forward a lot of the synthetic/artificial flavor notes. 

Integration: 0/2 - water + water = water

Carbonation + Texture: 0/1 - It’s just half carbonated seltzer

Finish + Cleanliness: 0/1 -  not refreshing, just a long aftertaste of the ""natural flavors""

  
[**Irish Coffee**](https://punchdrink.com/recipes/st-john-frizells-irish-coffee/) **- 2/10** (4tsp Simple Syrup, 4tsp Espresso)

Whiskey Expression: 0/3 - spirit is fully lost underneath the coffee and syrup.

Balance: 1/3 - Far sweeter than I'd drink coffee on it's own, but if you like a sweet coffee drink the balance is there.

Integration + Texture: 0/2 - The traditional whipped cream garnish would be good for a texture boost, but otherwise it's basically just coffee.

Warmth + Comfort: 1/1 - I think there wouldn't be a way for this not to be warm and comforting.

Finish + Aftertaste: 0/1 - Finishes how you'd expect for a fancy coffee drink. Lingering sweetness **and** lingering bitterness.

  
[**Mint Julep**](https://punchdrink.com/recipes/jeff-morgenthalers-mint-julep/) **- 4/10** (5 mint leaves muddled with 4tsp Rich Syrup)

Aroma + Mint Expression: 1/3 - mint is there, but feels very subdued. A bit brighter after dilution

Whiskey Presence: 1/3 - Giving that maple-y feeling we got in the Old Fashioned.

Balance: 0/2 - straight up sugar bomb

Texture: 1/1 - **needs** to be properly diluted

Evolution Over Time: 1/1 - Improves as it sits, which is how this drink was designed.

Balance: 0/3 - DIY Campari very dominant, which I personally don't hate but definitely draws it away from the classic flavor profile.

Whiskey Presence: 0/3 - all character of the spirit is lost

Integration: 0/2 - Campari dominates both of the other ingredients

Texture + Dilution: 1/1 - Body is as expected, no big surprises.

Finish + Perseverance: 1/1 - Long, lingering bittersweet finish

Citrus Balance: 0/3 - overpoweringly citrusy, which is weird with such small volumes

Whiskey Expression: 0/3 - all character of the spirit is lost

Sweetener Integration: 1/2 -It’s there’s, but it’s not doing much

Texture + Body: 1/1 - Nothing offensive, but nothing to write home about

Finish + Cohesion: 0/1 - long, unpleasantly tart finish

  
[**Whiskey Ginger**](https://www.thespruceeats.com/irish-whiskey-ginger-ale-beer-drinks-761457) **- 1/10** (just over 3floz chilled Ginger Ale)

Refreshment + Drinkability: 0/3 - I mean, it’s ginger ale

Whiskey Presence: 0/3 - spirit character is fully lost

Ginger Integration: 0/2 - Cocktail is indistinguishable from the ginger ale straight out of the can

Carbonation + Texture: 0/1 - Carbonation is definitely lost from the addition of the spirit

Finish + Cleanliness: 1/1 - Fine? I guess? It’s no different than just ginger ale



[**Hot Toddy**](https://punchdrink.com/recipes/hot-toddy/) **- 1/10** (.5floz Honey, 3floz Hot Water)

Warmth + Comfort: 1/3 - It's warm and comforting, but not much else

Balance: 0/2 - it’s just hot honey water

Texture + Mouthfeel: 0/1 -   it’s just hot honey water

Finish + Aftertaste: 0/1 - Hot. Honey. Water.

Is there a current or emerging standard for  separating the hardware control of domestic appliances (sensors, actuators, motor control, inputs, displays, etc), from a microcontroller module e.g. a matter node? 

To clarify, I'm sort of thinking of a combination of Linux BSP like config tree (DTS/DTB) standard which describes the hardware, a physical connector standard (think something like high density module interconnected), an inter-module protocol standard? The intention would be to make it easier for upgrades, supplier standardization, sku minimization. Like PCIe but on more mcu/appliance scale.

We sort of have this is the hobby field with the Home Automation projects for ESP32 like ESPHome and Tasmota, at least as far as the hardware pin to sensor and actuator mapping goes, but i'm thinking more washing machines, coffee makers, fridges etc.

My current understanding is that all these use entirely custom boards with at most module for the mcu.

I deleted all social media accounts cuz of this . Also her saying she’d marry me and saying i cheated on her was a huge effector for me here it is: 

I feel like I failed as a man and in my relationship. I just feel like a failure

7 months ago my ex (F25 now F26) accused me of cheating (M24 now 25) because I accepted a friend request on Snapchat of someone I vaguely knew. I didn’t know what she wanted. We just had a brief catchup convo (I never went out with this person or was on any romantic stage with her). The very first thing I stated was I had a gf and she asked how we met. As I was replying my ex looked over my shoulder and asked who it was. I told her honestly who it was. She didn’t say anything about it as we just continued hanging out that day at the beach. 2 days later she expressed her discomfort with it so I unadded that person, apologized and reassured her and said that’s a reasonable thing to ask. We’re both being reasonable.

This is where it all went downhill. I thought we had it handled. The replies got shorter and shorter. A few days after the Snapchat situation occurred from the beach. I had some poisoning and that weekend since we both still live at home, I got asked to mow the lawn, but I also didn’t anticipate getting some poisoning so I couldn’t. My mom got home from a vacation and she was visibly upset that I didn’t mow the lawn, but I was also in constant communication with they were saying I would mow it later that week on Tuesday when I get off from work because I would most likely feel better from the sun poison. I told my ex that and she went off on me about how keeping my word was important to her and that I broke my word to my mom. My response to that was I agree with that, but there’s much bigger things to be this worked up about and that it’s just the lawn and it’s not like I broke my word to a bigger responsibility like helping somebody out with something more important.

Since I’m an engineer and work at a power plant, it was 9 PM mid argument and I just fell asleep because I was so tired. I woke up at 4 AM for work and I had to get to work as soon as I got in because we were busy, so I wasn’t able to text my ex until my break at 11 AM the next day she said I Stonewater and put up a brick wall for 14 hours from 9 PM to 11 AM and then I just ignored her. I texted her at 11 AM and then at 2 PM and then again at 6 PM cuz at that point she was ignoring me. The text I sent at 6 pm was one I would’ve like to receive from her “my day was good I was grading papers as the kids watched a movie” and she replied an hour later that we needed to talk the next day because I ignored her.  the next day she broke up with me because she thought I was cheating on her with the whole Snapchat situation and that she said what if I asked you to mow the lawn and you don’t do it. Her single friends she talk to you about this and her married friends and her married sister both of those groups said different things. The married friends and sister told her she should stay with me while the single friends told her to leave. (We were together 5 months)

A week later, we met up at a coffee shop to talk where I read her the note I poured my heart and sole into. And took full accountability for what had happened and I told her I would never add anybody back again, and I didn’t know this would be so catastrophic to end a relationship. Both times in the car and at the coffee shop. She said she would’ve married me. The only reason why I got the coffee shop meet up was because the time span from her breaking up with me in the car and the coffee shop talk a week later I sent her three text messages and the fourth one was me asking if she was serious about the marriage thing. Where she said, yes I was serious. I thought the talk went well, but she said before we even started talking that this does not mean we’re getting back together today. But after the talk, she said we can go out to dinner and talk slowly from there on out that ultimately didn’t happen as I wished her a happy fourth of July and asked her holiday one and she never got back to me 11 days later, and after she drunk, called me after a concert I texted her for our dinner. Where she said, she ultimately needed a time and his face to heal, but she wish she was ready, but she felt like I didn’t give her the space. She said she needed. I texted her a week later after she said that to me, leaving the door open and thanking her for our time together and that you know how I feel about her and if she ever wants to continue with us, she can reach out to me and I also let her know what I was going to be doing. It’s been six months and I haven’t heard from her since she ghosted me. This whole thing really messed me up mentally I would never ever cheat on anybody. That’s not how I was raised, and that accusation really fucked me up and what she did to string me along too. My therapist my family and friends have all said that this was not something that should’ve caused a break up and that it wasn’t even a big problem but I still have a hard time seeing it and I really just feel like I fucked up so badly. I just feel like I lost the best thing ever happened to me. She projected the four years of abuse she went through from the person before me as well as the cheating stuff because she did go through a whole lot of physical and emotional abuse from that person.

But also, my therapist said that when she said to me during the coffee shop talk was completely out of line and said this problem on a scale from 1-10 was a “1” and her reaction was a “10” as it was disproportionate and almost clinical. Especially since she also used the app and I remember 2 weeks prior we were exchanging college and navy stories and she said there would be a guy on there that would hit her up every so often, so I know there was other people on her account. I asked if she still talked to him and she said no and that she’d leave him on open and that was the end of the convo. Anyways back to the story; at the coffee shop talk she said I needed to be a better son, and when I expressed to her that I was wanting to go to college to set an example for my future kids on how you could do anything you say your mind to being that I just got out of the Navy after five years and then I wanted to change careers from being an engineer to teaching. She questioned if I could raise a family go to school full-time and work full-time doing that and she said she didn’t think I could. She also called me lazy too. I just never heard from her again and it hurts because she was my first serious relationship and she was everything I was looking for morally and value wise, we clicked on the bigger picture items that we both wanted, but to end it over me accepting a friend request because she didn’t know what I talked about with this person after I treated her so great  I can’t wrap my head around it and can’t stop blaming myself. I also had to cancel a vacation because of this that I had planned later on in that summer. Everyone has said I dodged a bullet & didnt do anything wrong but I can’t seem to think so. She was my first gf. I’m a pretty secure guy so this all just doesn’t make sense to me still when I think about it. I told her I’d delete my account and she said “no you don’t have to id feel bad” and “I hope your family didn’t think I’m crazy”. I tried everything to repair this and she did nothing at all ",1,1768164357.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1qaajg8,https://i.redd.it/skjishye8scg1.jpeg,Repair report: intermittent leak underneath a Samsung refrigerator (RWF0700A / RSG307AAWP),"I figured I would do a write up on my recent refrigerator repair success in case somebody else has the same issue and comes across this post while searching Google for a solution. My refrigerator is from 2012, a Samsung RSG307AAWP (specifically, the RWF0700A with AWP options).

For the past week, I’ve had a mystery leak showing up under the freezer door every day or so. I’d wake up, go to make coffee, and find a puddle on the floor. 

I checked under the fridge and saw water couplings for the icemaker and dispenser, so I thought perhaps one of them failed. I replaced both and hoped  that was it. A day later, there was another puddle. Searching again on Google led me to believe that the issue might be a hairline crack in the icemaker waterline, inside of the door itself. As that line is foamed in place inside the door, it apparently requires replacing the entire door. 

I was planning on doing an external bypass of the door line (by attaching a line from the bottom coupling, running it along the side, and up into the top coupling on the door itself) when on a whim I plugged in everything that had happened and the things I had done to try to fix it into AI. It pointed me in the right direction by having a check to see if there was any ice or water at the very bottom of the freezer drawer. Which there was. Which then pointed to it being an issue with the defrost water freezing up. Removing the back panel of the freezer showed that this was definitely the issue, as it was solid ice. 

A hairdryer and a turkey baster with hot water (and a few towels) cleared the ice and got it draining again. It also turns out that this model is notorious for the duckbill drain filters in the back (access panel area) clogging over time (which mine were), so I trimmed the tip to prevents future backups. 

I also saw that many people “modded” their defrost to prevent it from freezing again by adding an aluminum clip (part number DA61-14306A) to the bottom heater. Since it’s only $6 on Amazon I bought one and will install it tomorrow. It clamps onto the bottom black heating tube and extends down into the drain. The heating tube heats up the clip and sends that heat down into the drain to prevent ice buildup from happening again.

I bought the fridge in 2012 and thought it was time to replace it, but it looks like it may still have a few more “bonus years” left in it. ",1,1768164350.0,appliancerepair,1,1.0,False

I’m doing it because it’s fine.
That’s the part I don’t think anyone understands.

It’s fine.

My job is fine. My apartment is fine. The coffee I drink is fine. The people in my life are fine—kind, even.
There is no villain, no cruelty, no tragic loss to point to.
The problem is the fine. The problem is that every morning feels like reading the same page of a book, over and over, and I am not even the protagonist. I’m a background character in my own life, moving through scenes with no lines, no motivation, no arc.

The loneliness I feel isn’t about being alone. It’s about being surrounded by people who love a version of me I retired years ago. They smile at a ghost. They ask how I am, and I say “fine,” and no one hears the silence in the word.

I tried.
I tried medication. I tried sunrises. I tried lists of things to live for. I tried yoga. I tried volunteering. I tried telling myself tomorrow would be different.
But it wasn’t. It was the same fine. The same soft, suffocating okay.

The sadness isn’t sharp. It’s ambient.
It’s not a stab—it’s a low, constant pressure, like being underwater without knowing when you last saw the surface.
You learn to breathe in it. You learn to call this breathing.

My therapist says depression is a liar.
But what if it’s the only thing telling the truth?
What if the lie was pretending I was built for this—for alarm clocks and small talk and stacking days like empty boxes until I die of old age in a room that’s fine?

I wrote notes. Then I burned them.
They weren’t explanations. They were apologies.
Sorry for leaving. Sorry for the mess. Sorry for the silence I’ve already been living in.

There’s a kind of grief that comes from knowing no one will truly understand why.
They’ll think it was a bad day.
They’ll think if they’d called, if they’d hugged harder, if they’d noticed—
But it’s not a bad day. It’s every day.
And it’s not that they didn’t notice.
It’s that what they noticed was the person I built for them to see.
I built him well. So well, even I believed it for a while.

I don’t want to die.
I want the performance to end.

So tonight, I’m stepping off stage.
It’s not anger. It’s an act of mercy.
For myself. For the ghost they love. For the person I was supposed to be but never figured out how to be.

It’s so quiet in here.
It’s the kind of quiet that hums.
I’ve been hearing it for years.
Tonight, I’m going to step into it, and I’m not going to come back.

You can’t save someone who’s already gone.
I’ve been gone a long time.

1qaaiib,https://www.reddit.com/r/girls/comments/1qaaiib/hannah_and_adams_break_makes_no_sense_to_me/,Hannah and Adam’s “break” makes no sense to me??,"Sorry for the long post! 

So I just binged the show and so confused about the breakup. 

I understand that before Hannah leaves for Iowa, Adam is already getting tired of the relationship. For the first 2 years they were together, Adam was seemingly madly in love with Hannah, calling her, “my best friend”, that if she died, “I couldn’t live. My whole world would blur. I wouldn’t even recognize what a tree is”. But towards the time he starts getting serious about his own life (taking his career/future more seriously) he starts to get annoyed with how overbearing she is. She starts feeling insecure & despite Adam saying he needs space, she crosses that boundary multiple times. This causes Adam to feel suffocated & annoyed. I think the straw that broke the camels back was when she dropped the bomb she was moving RIGHT before his big performance. 

They stayed together but it’s clear he’s upset with her. Right before Hannah leaves, Adam & her agree they’ll talk on the phone every day and she’d come to visit at least once a month. Then the night before she leaves, Adam is clearly upset. Hannah asks, “do you want to go over the plan again?”. Adam states, “the plan is that there is no plan”. Basically they both agree, then have sex. 

She leaves in the morning, & when she finally gets to Iowa, all of her friends agree to not talk to her about Adam. It’s clear that Hannah and Adam are not speaking. I assumed they broke up off screen & it would be clarified later how it ended… 

Fast forward & Hannah returns to the apartment. She is shocked that Adam has a girlfriend. She tells him “just 1 month ago you were in love with me”. So she was only gone 1 month. Adam states he was seeing Mimi-Rose for about 3 weeks. So it only took Adam roughly 1-2 weeks to move on. Hannah is acting as if he broke her heart… But they agreed to stop speaking when she went to Iowa? I assumed that meant they broke up. 

Later, the show alludes that they were in an open relationship. But only while they were apart. They wouldn’t talk to each other on the phone while Hannah was away, but when she came home to visit, the relationship would resume? I’m so confused on if they actually agreed to be “open” while she was gone or if they just agreed to not talk to each other during that time but were still together (since Adam sucked at it). Especially after Adam talked to Jessa, stating, “I just couldn’t talk on the phone anymore. She always wants to talk about stupid shit that doesn’t matter, like ‘look at this coffee shop or tree.’ I don’t care. It got so annoying”. 

If they agreed to be open while she was away, was Hannah upset because Adam got into a full blown relationship behind her back? Or was she upset cause she assumed he loved her enough to not see anyone else? That would make sense only if Hannah was open to causally date someone while away but she never mentions that. 

If they agreed to not speak to each other while Hannah was away but still were actively in a relationship, 1) how did they expect that to last two years of only speaking MAYBE once a month?, 2) how did Hannah not catch on that Adam already had one foot out the door, considering he was so annoyed with her on the phone he rather just not speak to her at all?

The break up just makes no sense to me. If anyone can explain it, I would really appreciate it.",26,1768164288.0,girls,7,0.87,False

so after a lifetime of owning and riding bikes i got a lot more serious about it over the past few years and have been building, working on and collecting bikes. just fell in love with cycling again and got the bug to build and modify and help friends with their bikes.

i had just finished an ATB build that i was super hyped on and wanted to ride with people.. sadly there aren't a ton of people in my world that really ride, so in an attempt to make new cycling frens i went to a group ride.. welllll, it was okay i guess, but when i walked in and the entire group was wearing skin-tight lycra, clip less shoes, and were all on 5k+ bikes, i immediately felt like i was just out of place with my vans slip-ons, alt bars, and flat pedals.

the 'ride' was more of an endurance test than a casual fun ride. 25 miles in less than 2 hours with no break or conversation until we finished. it just didn't feel fun to me.  i get it, and i'm truly not judging, but where do i find people that i fit in with in this alt-cycling world?!? there doesn't seem to be much overlap where i live there. i.e., it seems like either you go all out with the lycra and take a second mortgage out to buy a bike, or you wear regular clothes and probably just ride bikes because you don't have a car.

at one point my curiosity got the best of me and i even put a post on a sub last year asking if bibs and chamois were worth it and i got flamed for days by people literally telling me i wasn't a cyclist BC i didn't own a 1000 dollar cycling outfit.

the things that i have always felt more connected to were the people just out riding everyday. riding for fun, riding to the store for groceries, riding with friends for a coffee.. and then ripping up a singletrack cut otw home in skate shoes and carhartt's.. kind of the more urban/punk/skater/artsy side of things i guess. maybe that just doesn't exist where i live (Charleston SC) but i figured it cant hurt to ask if anyone else identifies with this and if so where did you find your community and how did you cultivate it?",34,1768164132.0,xbiking,41,0.84,False

Not exaggerating. Filming product videos on my phone during breaks, testing different angles at 2am, spending entire weekends analyzing why videos weren't converting. It consumed everything.

Why? Because 2026 is shaping up to be the year where organic content decides who makes sales and who doesn't. Paid ads are getting expensive. Everyone's selling the same products. The only edge is whether you can make someone watch your product video for 40 seconds and actually want to buy. Can't do that? You're broke.

Here's what nearly made me quit: grinding nonstop and making zero sales. I'd spend an entire day filming a product and the video would get 4,000 views but 0 purchases. Tried every angle I found. Copied what was working for successful sellers. Followed every ""winning formula"" people shared. Still stuck at terrible conversion rates.

Genuinely started thinking maybe I'm just not cut out for this. Some people can sell and I can't. That's honestly where I ended up.

Then something clicked. I'm working constantly but I don't actually know what's killing my conversions. I'm just trying random stuff hoping something sells.

So I changed everything. Stopped chasing product research and started measuring real data. Went back through 85+ product videos I'd posted, marked exactly where potential buyers left, and found 6 things that were destroying my conversion rates:

1. **Generic product intros kill sales** ""Check out this amazing product"" gets scrolled instantly. But ""This thing removed coffee stains from my white couch in 8 seconds"" stops scrollers and makes them want it. Show the result immediately, not the setup.
2. **Second 5 is where they decide to buy** Most people bounce between second 4 and 7 if you haven't shown the product solving their problem. I was doing feature lists first like an idiot. Now I show the product working exactly at second 5. That's what creates the buying urge.
3. **Any pause over 1 second kills conversions** Tracked this obsessively. Silence longer than 1.2 seconds makes people think the demo's over. Your comfortable product showcase pace reads as boring to buyers. Had to cut way tighter than felt natural. Felt rushed but sales jumped.
4. **Static product shots lose buyers fast** If your angle doesn't change for more than 3 seconds, potential customers mentally check out. Started constantly rotating the product, cutting to different uses, showing before-afters, creating nonstop visual proof. Conversion rate went from 0.8% to 3.2%.
5. **Apps that show exact problems are game changers** Shop analytics tell you people watched. I use an app called TikAlyzer, which tells you exactly when potential buyers left and why. Things like ""product appears at 6.5 seconds but buyers need to see it by 2, show it earlier"" or ""2.3 second pause before the result at second 12 drops 47%, cut it."" Went from 12 views per sale to averaging 31 sales per 1k views once I knew what killed purchase intent.
6. **Rewatch rate drives way more sales** Videos people watch twice convert significantly higher because they're actually considering buying. Started packing in details people miss first time, faster demonstrations, little benefits you catch on rewatches. Rewatch rate jumped from 7% to 34% and revenue exploded.

The breakthrough was stopping random testing and measuring exactly what was killing conversions in my product videos.

If you're getting views but no sales, it's not your products or pricing. You just don't know which parts of your videos work and which parts lose buyers.

Sharing this because I burned months getting traffic but no revenue when the answers were in my video data the whole time. 2026 is looking massive for sellers who understand what actually converts and I wish someone had just explained this to me when I started.

It's an easygoing place to sit down and get creative at all skill levels, grab some refreshments (we have some snacks and drinks, but you can bring your own or bring some from across the street at Subjective Coffee, who are our friends), and paint, draw, sculpt clay, write a novel, whatever. We have some things to keep kids busy like playdough, coloring books, and little projects. Event schedules are subject to change, but at the moment, we have music open mics on Fridays. We have stand-up open mics every other Thursday. We often have classes on weekends and are always open to it if folks want to run a class or an event.

We're a non-profit and while we take donations, many things like open studio are free with rental or purchase costs *if* you need supplies, but you can bring your own. Our classes are not typically expensive and we sell our snacks cheap. Our main goal is to build a community in this neck of the woods that is inclusive and hopefully a light hearted place for creatives to gather.

Our space is at 3704 w 72nd Ave, roughly at 72nd and Lowell and isn't far from the US36 and Federal exit or a short walk from the Westminster RTD train station.

4. **Static shots for 3+ seconds lose people** If nothing changes visually for more than 3 seconds, viewers zone out mentally. Started constantly switching angles, inserting different clips, moving text around, creating nonstop visual variety. Halfway retention jumped from 39% to 70%.

Something Answered Me Instead.,"I’m writing this with my right ankle wrapped so tight my toes keep going numb. The urgent care doctor called it a “moderate sprain” like that phrase makes it feel smaller. My left forearm has bruises shaped like fingers, too long to look right. The nurse didn’t say that part out loud, but her eyes did.

I went camping to get away from people. I ended up begging one for directions over a radio, and by the end of the night I wasn’t sure the voice on the other end was a person at all.

I want to be clear about something up front: I wasn’t out there trying to test myself. I’m not a survival guy. I wasn’t hunting for creepy stories. I had a reservation and a map and enough food for one night. I picked a back loop because the main campground was full of headlights, barking dogs, and Bluetooth speakers.

The park brochure called my site “primitive.” That should have been a hint. It meant a fire ring, a flat patch of dirt, and a picnic table with initials carved into it so deep the wood looked chewed.

The evening was normal. That’s the part I keep coming back to, like if I replay it enough times I’ll find the exact moment I made the wrong choice.

I ate a lukewarm meal out of a foil tray. I rinsed my hands with a water bottle. I watched the sun drain out of the trees. A couple times I heard something moving in the brush and I did the usual mental math: squirrel, raccoon, deer. I told myself I’d be up early and out before the day hikers showed.

Around nine, when the air got cold and damp, I realized my headlamp wasn’t in my pack.

I’d left it in the car.

The car was parked at a small pull-off a couple miles back. I remembered the pull-off because there was a brown trail sign with the number on it and one of those map cases bolted to a post. The plastic cover on the map case was cracked and someone had stuffed wet paper inside like they’d tried to light it on fire and failed.

I told myself it was a quick walk. I had my phone light. The trail was straightforward. One main path, then a spur.

Fifteen minutes, in and out.

I took my keys, my phone, and without thinking much about it, the little handheld radio I’d brought “just in case.” It was a cheap black unit with a stubby antenna and a screen that glowed green. I’d bought it years ago and barely used it, but I’d programmed in the park’s “ranger frequency” from something I’d read when planning the trip. It made me feel responsible, like I had a backup plan.

The first part of the walk was fine. My phone light made the trail look like a tunnel, and everything beyond it was just shadow and bark. The air smelled like pine needles and cold soil. My footsteps sounded louder than they should have.

Ten minutes in, I passed a reflective trail marker nailed to a tree. It flashed back at me like an animal eye. I remember thinking, good, I’m still on something official.

Another ten minutes and I still hadn’t hit the pull-off.

No gate. No gravel. No sign.

I slowed down, then stopped.

It wasn’t the dramatic “the forest went silent” thing people say. There were still insects. Wind in the needles. Something small moving deeper in the brush. But the human layer was gone. No distant voices from the campground. No car doors. No far-off engine.

I swung my light down and saw something that made my stomach drop.

My own boot prints, faint in the dust, curving off the trail and back toward where I’d come from. Not a clean loop like a track. A sloppy arc.

I had been walking in a circle without realizing it.

My first instinct was to laugh at myself, because that’s what you do when you’re embarrassed and alone. I took out the paper map and held it up in the beam of my phone. The lines and symbols might as well have been a subway map for a city I’d never visited. Everything around me looked the same. Trees, roots, brush, darkness.

I checked the time. 10:18 p.m.

That was when I remembered the radio.

I turned it on. The screen lit up. Static hissed softly.

I pressed the transmit button.

“Ranger station, this is a camper on the back loop. I’m lost. I’m on Trail Six somewhere, I think. I’m trying to get back to the entrance. Do you copy?”

Static, then a click like someone keying a mic.

A voice came through, flattened by the speaker, calm enough to make my shoulders sag with relief.

“Copy. Stand by.”

I let out a breath I didn’t realize I’d been holding.

“Thank you,” I said. “I parked at a pull-off by a gated service road. Brown sign, map case. I walked out to grab my headlamp and I looped. I can’t find the spur back.”

Another pause. Behind the voice, I could hear a faint background sound like wind hitting a building, or maybe just the radio adding its own texture.

“Describe what you see,” the voice said.

It sounded like a man, middle-aged, the kind of voice you’d expect from someone who’s given directions for a living. Not hurried. Not annoyed. Like he’d rather talk you down than lecture you later.

“Evergreens,” I said. “Packed dirt trail. I’m at a fork. Left looks wider, right looks narrow and drops down.”

“Take the right,” he said.

I stared at the fork. The left side looked like the main trail. The right looked like an animal path that someone had convinced themselves was a trail.

“The right is smaller,” I said. “Are you sure?”

“Yes,” he said, immediate. “Right will put you on the access road.”

That didn’t match what my common sense was screaming, but I had a voice on the radio. A ranger. Someone official. I wanted badly for that to be true.

I turned right.

As I walked, I narrated what I could. A fallen limb. A patch of damp ground. The slope. I kept waiting for the trail to open up onto something recognizable.

The radio clicked again.

“Keep your light low,” the voice said.

“What?”

“Keep it low,” he repeated. “Do not swing it around.”

That made no sense. Every safety pamphlet I’d ever seen said the opposite: make yourself visible. Stay put. Conserve battery. Signal.

I should have stopped right there. I should have turned the radio off and started climbing toward higher ground, or stayed put and waited for morning.

Instead, I did what he said. I pointed the beam at my feet and tried not to move it.

A minute later, he asked, “Do you hear water?”

I stopped and listened.

Nothing I could pick out. Just the normal whispering of trees.

“No.”

“Do you hear anything else?” he asked.

The question was too open. Too curious. It didn’t sound like someone trying to locate me. It sounded like someone checking whether I was alone.

“Just… woods,” I said. “Why?”

Static. Then, softly, “Keep moving.”

My phone battery ticked down. Twenty percent. Eighteen. The cold was chewing through it faster than I expected.

I tried to keep my breathing steady. I kept walking.

That’s when I saw the reflective marker again.

Except it wasn’t on a tree.

It was on the ground.

A small rectangle of reflective tape in the dirt, like it had been torn off and dropped. The soil around it looked scraped, disturbed. Not clear footprints, more like something heavy had been dragged across the trail and then lifted.

I crouched without thinking and touched it with two fingers.

The tape was damp and cold.

The radio clicked.

“Don’t touch that,” the voice said.

I froze mid-crouch.

“How did you…” I started, then swallowed it. He couldn’t see me. He couldn’t.

I stood up slowly, heart thudding.

“Ranger,” I said, “what’s your name?”

A pause long enough for the static to fill my head.

“You don’t need that,” the voice said.

My skin prickled under my shirt.

Behind me, somewhere off the trail, something moved.

Not a squirrel. Not a deer. It was too measured. Too heavy.

Footsteps.

One slow step, then another, like something matching my stop and start.

I turned my head without lifting the light. The beam stayed low, because part of me still clung to the idea that following the instructions kept me safe.

“Ranger,” I said quietly, “there’s something behind me.”

The voice on the radio didn’t sound surprised.

“I know,” it said.

My mouth went dry.

I lifted the light anyway and swung it toward the sound.

The beam caught tree trunks, low brush, a tangle of branches. Nothing obvious.

And the moment my light moved, the footsteps stopped.

I stood there in my own shaky cone of light, listening so hard my ears felt strained.

“Who is this?” I said into the radio, and my voice cracked on the last word.

Static surged, then cut suddenly, cleanly, like someone had switched channels.

Then I heard my own voice come back at me through the speaker.

“Who is this?”

Same cadence. Same crack. Same tiny breath at the end.

It wasn’t a recording quality. It wasn’t muffled like a replay. It was like someone had taken my words and thrown them right back.

I jerked the radio away from my face like it had burned me.

The voice returned, calm again, but different now. Less like a person. More like someone wearing a person’s tone.

“Don’t raise your voice,” it said. “Keep moving.”

My chest tightened. I forced myself to turn and start walking, because standing still felt worse. The trail ahead looked narrower than before. Less maintained. The smell changed, too. A sourness under the pine, like wet fur and old meat.

My phone light flickered.

“Ranger,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady, “I’m going back to the fork. The left trail is wider.”

The radio clicked so fast it felt like an interruption.

“No,” the voice said, sharp. “Do not go back.”

At the same moment, the sound behind me changed.

It wasn’t footsteps anymore. It was a dry, rapid clicking, like someone trying to speak through a throat that didn’t work right.

I stopped walking. My hands shook. I could feel my pulse in my fingers.

I swung the light again.

This time the beam caught it.

Between two trees, half-hidden, a shape that was too tall to be a deer and too thin to be a bear. It was standing upright, but not like a person stands. Its posture was wrong, weight distributed like it wasn’t used to its own joints.

Its torso was narrow and too long. Its arms hung low, almost to its knees. The head was the worst part, because my brain kept trying to label it and failing. It wasn’t antlers like the stories. It wasn’t a clean skull. It looked like skin pulled tight over something sharp. The top had uneven ridges like bone pushing out from inside.

Two dull reflective points caught my light, not bright like animal eyes, but wet and heavy.

It tilted its head.

Then it took one step toward me.

Not loud. Not charging. Just a single, confident step that erased distance too quickly.

I ran.

I ran because I didn’t have a better idea.

The trail pitched down and twisted. My phone light bounced wildly. My breathing turned into ragged pulls. Behind me, I heard movement through brush that didn’t sound panicked. It sounded like it knew exactly where it was going.

The radio in my fist hissed.

“Don’t run,” the voice said.

It didn’t sound worried. It sounded irritated, like I’d stopped playing the game correctly.

My phone light died in the middle of a step.

One second I had a cone of visibility, the next I was in full dark.

I nearly faceplanted. My arms flailed. My foot caught a root. I stumbled, recovered, and kept moving with only the green glow of the radio screen.

The creature’s clicking breath stayed with me. Sometimes louder, sometimes fainter, like it was pacing me from the side.

I tried to slow down to save my ankle, but the moment I did, the clicking got closer.

I ran again.

The trail dipped hard. My foot hit something slick. I went down on my hands and knees. Pain shot up my right wrist like a spark. My knee slammed a root. I bit my tongue and tasted blood.

I pushed up fast, panicked, and my right ankle rolled on loose needles.

A clean, sharp pain climbed my leg and almost took me down again. I had to catch myself against a tree trunk.

I couldn’t put my full weight on that foot anymore.

Behind me, the clicking stopped.

For one breathless second, I thought maybe it had paused. Maybe it had decided I wasn’t worth it.

Then I felt it behind me. Not in a mystical way. In the way you feel a person standing too close in an elevator. Air pressure. Heat. Presence.

I turned, lifting the radio screen like a useless flashlight.

The green glow caught a piece of its face and shoulder.

Up close it wasn’t just thin. It looked damaged. Skin torn and healed wrong, like something had ripped it and it had closed back up without care. The mouth was pulled too wide, lips stretched tight, teeth crowded and uneven like they’d grown in wrong.

It reached toward me with those long, jointed fingers.

I swung the radio at it as hard as I could. Plastic cracked against something solid. The radio flew out of my hand and skittered into the dark.

The creature didn’t flinch.

It grabbed my left forearm.

The grip wasn’t wet or slimy like horror movies. It was cold and dry, like grabbing a dead branch. The pressure was immediate, crushing. Pain bloomed so fast it turned my vision white.

I screamed.

I yanked back, twisting. It dragged me a step like I weighed nothing. Its fingers tightened and I felt something in my arm give in a way that made me nauseous.

My free hand fumbled in my jacket pocket and found the one thing I’d thrown in there without thinking: a cheap road flare. I’d packed it because it was small and because I’d told myself, “It can’t hurt.”

My fingers shook so badly I almost dropped it.

I popped the cap, scraped the tip, and for half a second nothing happened and I thought I’d just died doing something stupid.

Then it lit.

A violent red flame, hissing, bright enough to turn the trees into hard-edged black silhouettes.

The creature jerked back like the light hit it physically. Its grip loosened. Not a full release, but enough.

I ripped my arm free and stumbled backward, holding the flare out between us like a spear.

In the red light I saw more of it. Legs too long. Knees bending in a way that looked half backwards. Skin mottled like bruises under thin flesh. Dark stains around its mouth that weren’t fresh but weren’t old enough to be nothing.

It didn’t charge.

It watched the flare with the same tilted-head curiosity, clicking softly.

Then it did something that snapped the situation into a new, colder shape.

It looked past the flare.

Down at the ground.

Toward where the radio had slid.

It took a slow step toward it, careful, like it didn’t want to get close to the flare.

Another step.

It wasn’t focused on me. It wanted the radio.

My throat tightened. I backed away, flare held out, and realized the “ranger” voice hadn’t been trying to save me. It had been trying to keep me moving, keep me talking, keep me transmitting.

Like a lure.

Like a line it could follow.

The creature crouched, long limbs folding wrong, and picked up the radio with those stick-like fingers. It turned it over as if it understood what it was holding.

Then the radio clicked.

And from the speaker, not from my hand now but from the thing’s hand, came the voice again.

Calm. Patient.

“Describe what you see.”

The creature lifted its head, still holding the radio, and the dull reflective points of its eyes turned to me.

I felt my stomach drop through the floor.

I didn’t wait to see what it would do next. I turned and limped away as fast as my ankle would let me, flare burning down in my hand, my left arm throbbing and numb where it had grabbed me.

The clicking breath moved with me, not rushing, not fading. Just staying close enough to remind me it could.

The flare shortened quickly, heat biting my palm. Red sparks spat into the dark.

I forced myself to follow the trail because stepping off into the trees felt like stepping off a dock at night. You don’t know what you’ll hit until you do.

Ahead, through the trees, I saw something angular and straight. Not a branch. Not a trunk.

A signpost.

I limped toward it and almost cried when I saw the reflective letters catch the flare light.

TRAIL 6

SERVICE ROAD 0.4

RANGER STATION 1.2

My brain snagged on that last line.

RANGER STATION.

Deeper.

Not out.

The flare hissed lower. The light dimmed.

From off to my right, through the trees, I heard the radio again.

A little burst of static.

A click.

Then my own voice, thin and distant, as if someone had learned the shape of it and was practicing.

“Ranger station… do you copy?”

I froze.

The sound didn’t come from behind. It came from the side, like it was trying to draw my attention off the trail. Toward the trees. Toward the direction that sign said “RANGER STATION.”

My chest tightened hard enough to hurt.

I turned my face away from the sound and forced my feet to move toward “SERVICE ROAD 0.4.”

Every step on that ankle was a bright spike of pain. My left arm felt heavy and wrong. I could feel bruising spreading under my skin.

The flare died with a wet sputter.

Darkness swallowed everything.

I stood still for a second because my eyes were useless and my panic was loud. Then I heard it again. The clicking breath, closer, patient.

I moved.

I walked by feel, hands out, fingertips catching branches, following the faint line of packed dirt underfoot. I slipped once on loose gravel and almost went down. I caught myself against a tree and felt bark dig into my scraped palm.

The radio crackled in the trees.

Sometimes it was static. Sometimes it was my voice repeating the same few words. Sometimes it was that calm “ranger” voice saying, “You’re almost there.”

After what felt like an hour but was probably ten minutes, the ground changed under my boots.

Gravel.

Then flat, hard-packed gravel.

A road.

I stepped forward and the tree line opened just enough that I could make out a darker shape ahead.

A metal gate.

I stumbled to it and grabbed it with both hands like it was a lifeline. The metal was cold. I pressed my forehead to it and pulled in air that tasted like rust and sap.

Behind me, the radio static swelled.

Close.

I turned slowly.

I couldn’t see it in the dark, but I could hear it. The clicking breath, a soft scrape of something moving through brush just off the road, staying in the cover of trees.

The radio clicked.

“Open the gate,” the voice said.

It didn’t sound like a ranger anymore. It sounded strained, like the words were being forced out through a mouth that didn’t fit them.

“I can’t,” I whispered, because my brain was still treating it like a conversation.

“Open it,” the voice repeated.

And under the words, the clicking breath accelerated, excited.

I backed away from the gate, then stopped, because backing away meant stepping closer to the sound.

I stood in the middle of the service road, gravel under my boots, and tried to think.

Cars used service roads. Rangers used service roads. If I followed it long enough, I’d hit something. A lot. A building. A sign. Anything.

Staying still felt like waiting to be taken.

I chose movement.

I limped down the road, faster than my ankle wanted, gravel crunching underfoot. To my right, in the tree line, something moved with me, quiet and effortless.

Every few seconds, the radio voice tried a new angle.

“Turn back.”

“You’re going the wrong way.”

“Your car is not there.”

Then, softer, using my voice again, like it was trying to sound concerned.

“Hey… hey… where are you?”

I didn’t answer. I bit down on my tongue and kept moving.

The road curved. The trees thinned.

And then, ahead, I saw the faint outline of a vehicle.

My car.

The pull-off.

I almost fell from relief. My hands shook so badly I dropped my keys once, then found them by feel and hit the unlock button.

The beep sounded like the best noise I’ve ever heard.

I got the driver’s door open and folded into the seat, dragging my bad ankle in like it didn’t belong to me. Pain flashed up my leg. I slammed the door and locked it.

For a second, I sat there in the dark, breathing hard, staring straight ahead like that would keep me safe.

Then I looked at my side mirror.

At the edge of the pull-off, where gravel met trees, something stood half-hidden in the brush.

Tall. Too thin. Motionless.

In one hand, a small green glow.

My radio.

It lifted the radio slightly, as if showing it to me.

Then the speaker crackled.

And the voice that came out was mine, careful and patient, exactly the way I’d sounded when I thought help was real.

“Ranger station… do you copy?”

I turned the key.

The engine coughed, then caught. The dashboard lit up.

The headlights snapped on, bright white, flooding the pull-off.

The brush at the edge of the trees was empty.

No movement. No shape. No glowing radio.

Just branches and shadow.

I didn’t wait. I threw the car into reverse, gravel spraying, and drove like I was late for my own funeral.

I didn’t stop until I hit pavement. I didn’t stop until I saw another vehicle’s taillights. I didn’t stop until I found the park office, a dark building with a big sign and an emergency phone mounted on the wall.

I called.

I told the person on the other end that I was injured, lost, and something had chased me. I didn’t say “wendigo.” I didn’t say “monster.” I said “an animal” because I needed them to send someone and I didn’t want to sound insane.

They told me to stay in my car with the doors locked until a ranger arrived.

A ranger truck rolled in twenty minutes later. Light bar flashing, tires crunching. The ranger was young, maybe late twenties, and he had the exhausted posture of someone who’d already worked a full day and then got pulled into someone else’s mistake.

He walked up to my window and I rolled it down an inch. I didn’t mean to, but the second I saw a uniform my throat tightened and my eyes burned.

He took one look at my hands and my ankle and swore under his breath.

“Jesus,” he muttered. “Okay. Okay. You did the right thing coming here.”

He helped me into his truck. The heater blew air that smelled like coffee and old vinyl. My body started shaking now that the danger was gone enough for my nerves to catch up.

On the drive to the clinic in the nearest town, he asked me what happened.

I told him the clean version first. Lost the trail. Radioed for help. Got turned around. Something grabbed me.

I didn’t talk about the voice using my voice until the words fell out by accident.

“It repeated me,” I said, staring at my bruised arm. “Like… like it was throwing my words back.”

The ranger’s hands tightened on the steering wheel.

“What channel were you on?” he asked.

“Seven,” I said. “The ranger frequency.”

His eyes flicked to me, quick.

“That’s not ranger dispatch,” he said.

My mouth went dry. “Then who answered me?”

He didn’t answer right away. He watched the road ahead like he was reading it.

Finally he said, “Nobody should have.”

The clinic wrapped my ankle, checked my wrist, cleaned the scrapes on my palms. The bruises on my forearm had started to bloom dark purple by then, finger-shaped, too long. The nurse asked if I’d gotten caught in wire.

I nodded because it was easier than explaining I’d been grabbed by something that didn’t move like a person.

When I came out, the ranger was still there. He stood by his truck with his hands in his jacket pockets like he didn’t want to leave me alone to walk to my car.

“Did you find my radio?” I asked, and I hated how small my voice sounded.

He shook his head. “No.”

I swallowed. “Is there… is there an old ranger station out there? Like an actual tower?”

He hesitated, then sighed like he’d made a decision.

“There’s a decommissioned lookout,” he said. “Old structure. Not staffed. We don’t use it.”

“So the voice could’ve been someone messing with me,” I said, trying to find a normal explanation to cling to.

He looked tired, and for a second he looked older than he was.

“It’s possible,” he said. “But listen to me. If you ever camp again, you do not call for help on random channels. You call the emergency number. You stay put. You don’t let a voice tell you to walk deeper. You understand?”

I nodded.

He leaned closer, lowering his voice like the night could hear us.

“And if you hear your own voice come back at you,” he added, “you stop transmitting.”

I stared at him.

“You’ve heard that?” I asked.

He didn’t answer directly. He just said, “Dispatch got weird traffic tonight. On that channel. We thought it was interference at first.”

“What kind of traffic?”

He rubbed his jaw like he didn’t want to say it.

“A man asking for help,” he said finally. “Saying he was lost. Saying he was on Trail Six.”

My stomach dropped.

“That was me,” I whispered.

He shook his head once.

“No,” he said. “It started before you called. And it kept going after you stopped.”

I didn’t sleep that night. Not really. I lay in my apartment with my ankle propped up and my forearm throbbing and I kept hearing that clicking breath in the back of my head, like my brain had recorded it and didn’t know how to delete it.

Two days later, in daylight, I went back to the park office. I told myself I was going to file a report about the radio. I told myself I wanted closure.

The woman behind the counter was older, hair pulled back, eyes sharp in the way people get after years of dealing with strangers who don’t read rules.

I gave her my name and the date. She typed into her computer. Her nails clicked against the keys.

“No lost property matching that,” she said.

I nodded like I expected it.

Then I asked, carefully, “Do you get… strange radio calls? People using the wrong channel?”

Her eyes shifted, just a fraction, to a binder on the desk behind her. A plain three-ring binder with a white label strip.

She didn’t reach for it. She didn’t have to.

“There are signs in the brochure kiosk,” she said, voice neutral. “About emergency procedures.”

“I saw those,” I said. “They don’t mention radio channels.”

Her expression didn’t change, but her tone did. It got flatter.

“We don’t provide radio channels,” she said. “Not anymore.”

“Why?”

She stared at me for a moment like she was deciding how much truth a stranger deserved.

Then she slid a piece of laminated paper across the counter. Not a brochure. Not a map. Something that looked like it had been printed in-house and updated a hundred times.

It had one line in bold at the top:

DO NOT REQUEST ASSISTANCE OVER UNMONITORED FREQUENCIES.

Below that were three bullet points. Short. Clinical.

	•	If you are lost, stay on trail and stay put.

	•	Use emergency phones or call 911 if service is available.

	•	If you hear a voice directing you off-trail, do not respond.

My mouth went dry.

“That’s a weird thing to have to print,” I said.

She didn’t smile.

“It became necessary,” she said.

I tried to speak. My throat felt tight.

“Has anyone… been hurt?” I asked.

She paused long enough that my stomach sank again, then said, “People get found. People don’t get found. Same as any park.”

She reached under the counter and pulled out a small plastic bag.

Inside was a handheld radio. Not mine. Different brand. Same cheap shape. Mud dried into the grooves.

She set it on the counter like evidence.

“We find these sometimes,” she said. “Not often. Usually they’re dead. Sometimes they’re still on.”

I stared at it.

“What do you do when they’re still on?” I asked.

Her eyes met mine.

“We turn them off,” she said. “And we don’t stand there listening.”

I left after that. I didn’t argue. I didn’t ask for the location of the decommissioned lookout. I didn’t ask about the binder. I didn’t want to.

I drove home with both hands tight on the wheel and the irrational feeling that if I relaxed my grip, the car would drift into the trees.

Here’s the last thing I’ll say, because it’s the part I can’t explain away.

Last night, I was cleaning out my pack. Shaking dirt out of the seams. Counting what I’d lost.

I found the flare wrapper in a side pocket and the edge of the paper map, folded wrong from when I’d yanked it out. I found a smear of dried blood on the strap where my wrist scraped it when I fell.

And tucked into the smallest inside pocket, the one I never use, I found a strip of reflective tape.

The same kind that had been on the ground.

Damp. Cold, even though it had been inside my apartment for days.

When I held it up to the light, I saw something stuck to the adhesive.

A single dark hair, coarse and stiff, like it didn’t belong to any animal I know.

I threw the tape away. I took the trash out immediately. I washed my hands until my skin was raw.

And later, lying in bed with my ankle throbbing and my arm bruised and my phone charging on the nightstand, I heard a sound that made my whole body lock up.

A soft burst of static.

A click.

Not from outside. Not from the woods.

From somewhere in my apartment, close enough that I could hear the tiny speaker distortion.

Then, very quietly, my own voice, patient and calm, asking the same question it asked the night I thought help was real.

Something Answered Me Instead.,"I’m writing this with my right ankle wrapped so tight my toes keep going numb. The urgent care doctor called it a “moderate sprain” like that phrase makes it feel smaller. My left forearm has bruises shaped like fingers, too long to look right. The nurse didn’t say that part out loud, but her eyes did.

I went camping to get away from people. I ended up begging one for directions over a radio, and by the end of the night I wasn’t sure the voice on the other end was a person at all.

I want to be clear about something up front: I wasn’t out there trying to test myself. I’m not a survival guy. I wasn’t hunting for creepy stories. I had a reservation and a map and enough food for one night. I picked a back loop because the main campground was full of headlights, barking dogs, and Bluetooth speakers.

The park brochure called my site “primitive.” That should have been a hint. It meant a fire ring, a flat patch of dirt, and a picnic table with initials carved into it so deep the wood looked chewed.

The evening was normal. That’s the part I keep coming back to, like if I replay it enough times I’ll find the exact moment I made the wrong choice.

I ate a lukewarm meal out of a foil tray. I rinsed my hands with a water bottle. I watched the sun drain out of the trees. A couple times I heard something moving in the brush and I did the usual mental math: squirrel, raccoon, deer. I told myself I’d be up early and out before the day hikers showed.

Around nine, when the air got cold and damp, I realized my headlamp wasn’t in my pack.

I’d left it in the car.

The car was parked at a small pull-off a couple miles back. I remembered the pull-off because there was a brown trail sign with the number on it and one of those map cases bolted to a post. The plastic cover on the map case was cracked and someone had stuffed wet paper inside like they’d tried to light it on fire and failed.

I told myself it was a quick walk. I had my phone light. The trail was straightforward. One main path, then a spur.

Fifteen minutes, in and out.

I took my keys, my phone, and without thinking much about it, the little handheld radio I’d brought “just in case.” It was a cheap black unit with a stubby antenna and a screen that glowed green. I’d bought it years ago and barely used it, but I’d programmed in the park’s “ranger frequency” from something I’d read when planning the trip. It made me feel responsible, like I had a backup plan.

The first part of the walk was fine. My phone light made the trail look like a tunnel, and everything beyond it was just shadow and bark. The air smelled like pine needles and cold soil. My footsteps sounded louder than they should have.

Ten minutes in, I passed a reflective trail marker nailed to a tree. It flashed back at me like an animal eye. I remember thinking, good, I’m still on something official.

Another ten minutes and I still hadn’t hit the pull-off.

No gate. No gravel. No sign.

I slowed down, then stopped.

It wasn’t the dramatic “the forest went silent” thing people say. There were still insects. Wind in the needles. Something small moving deeper in the brush. But the human layer was gone. No distant voices from the campground. No car doors. No far-off engine.

I swung my light down and saw something that made my stomach drop.

My own boot prints, faint in the dust, curving off the trail and back toward where I’d come from. Not a clean loop like a track. A sloppy arc.

I had been walking in a circle without realizing it.

My first instinct was to laugh at myself, because that’s what you do when you’re embarrassed and alone. I took out the paper map and held it up in the beam of my phone. The lines and symbols might as well have been a subway map for a city I’d never visited. Everything around me looked the same. Trees, roots, brush, darkness.

I checked the time. 10:18 p.m.

That was when I remembered the radio.

I turned it on. The screen lit up. Static hissed softly.

I pressed the transmit button.

“Ranger station, this is a camper on the back loop. I’m lost. I’m on Trail Six somewhere, I think. I’m trying to get back to the entrance. Do you copy?”

Static, then a click like someone keying a mic.

A voice came through, flattened by the speaker, calm enough to make my shoulders sag with relief.

“Copy. Stand by.”

I let out a breath I didn’t realize I’d been holding.

“Thank you,” I said. “I parked at a pull-off by a gated service road. Brown sign, map case. I walked out to grab my headlamp and I looped. I can’t find the spur back.”

Another pause. Behind the voice, I could hear a faint background sound like wind hitting a building, or maybe just the radio adding its own texture.

“Describe what you see,” the voice said.

It sounded like a man, middle-aged, the kind of voice you’d expect from someone who’s given directions for a living. Not hurried. Not annoyed. Like he’d rather talk you down than lecture you later.

“Evergreens,” I said. “Packed dirt trail. I’m at a fork. Left looks wider, right looks narrow and drops down.”

“Take the right,” he said.

I stared at the fork. The left side looked like the main trail. The right looked like an animal path that someone had convinced themselves was a trail.

“The right is smaller,” I said. “Are you sure?”

“Yes,” he said, immediate. “Right will put you on the access road.”

That didn’t match what my common sense was screaming, but I had a voice on the radio. A ranger. Someone official. I wanted badly for that to be true.

I turned right.

As I walked, I narrated what I could. A fallen limb. A patch of damp ground. The slope. I kept waiting for the trail to open up onto something recognizable.

The radio clicked again.

“Keep your light low,” the voice said.

“What?”

“Keep it low,” he repeated. “Do not swing it around.”

That made no sense. Every safety pamphlet I’d ever seen said the opposite: make yourself visible. Stay put. Conserve battery. Signal.

I should have stopped right there. I should have turned the radio off and started climbing toward higher ground, or stayed put and waited for morning.

Instead, I did what he said. I pointed the beam at my feet and tried not to move it.

A minute later, he asked, “Do you hear water?”

I stopped and listened.

Nothing I could pick out. Just the normal whispering of trees.

“No.”

“Do you hear anything else?” he asked.

The question was too open. Too curious. It didn’t sound like someone trying to locate me. It sounded like someone checking whether I was alone.

“Just… woods,” I said. “Why?”

Static. Then, softly, “Keep moving.”

My phone battery ticked down. Twenty percent. Eighteen. The cold was chewing through it faster than I expected.

I tried to keep my breathing steady. I kept walking.

That’s when I saw the reflective marker again.

Except it wasn’t on a tree.

It was on the ground.

A small rectangle of reflective tape in the dirt, like it had been torn off and dropped. The soil around it looked scraped, disturbed. Not clear footprints, more like something heavy had been dragged across the trail and then lifted.

I crouched without thinking and touched it with two fingers.

The tape was damp and cold.

The radio clicked.

“Don’t touch that,” the voice said.

I froze mid-crouch.

“How did you…” I started, then swallowed it. He couldn’t see me. He couldn’t.

I stood up slowly, heart thudding.

“Ranger,” I said, “what’s your name?”

A pause long enough for the static to fill my head.

“You don’t need that,” the voice said.

My skin prickled under my shirt.

Behind me, somewhere off the trail, something moved.

Not a squirrel. Not a deer. It was too measured. Too heavy.

Footsteps.

One slow step, then another, like something matching my stop and start.

I turned my head without lifting the light. The beam stayed low, because part of me still clung to the idea that following the instructions kept me safe.

“Ranger,” I said quietly, “there’s something behind me.”

The voice on the radio didn’t sound surprised.

“I know,” it said.

My mouth went dry.

I lifted the light anyway and swung it toward the sound.

The beam caught tree trunks, low brush, a tangle of branches. Nothing obvious.

And the moment my light moved, the footsteps stopped.

I stood there in my own shaky cone of light, listening so hard my ears felt strained.

“Who is this?” I said into the radio, and my voice cracked on the last word.

Static surged, then cut suddenly, cleanly, like someone had switched channels.

Then I heard my own voice come back at me through the speaker.

“Who is this?”

Same cadence. Same crack. Same tiny breath at the end.

It wasn’t a recording quality. It wasn’t muffled like a replay. It was like someone had taken my words and thrown them right back.

I jerked the radio away from my face like it had burned me.

The voice returned, calm again, but different now. Less like a person. More like someone wearing a person’s tone.

“Don’t raise your voice,” it said. “Keep moving.”

My chest tightened. I forced myself to turn and start walking, because standing still felt worse. The trail ahead looked narrower than before. Less maintained. The smell changed, too. A sourness under the pine, like wet fur and old meat.

My phone light flickered.

“Ranger,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady, “I’m going back to the fork. The left trail is wider.”

The radio clicked so fast it felt like an interruption.

“No,” the voice said, sharp. “Do not go back.”

At the same moment, the sound behind me changed.

It wasn’t footsteps anymore. It was a dry, rapid clicking, like someone trying to speak through a throat that didn’t work right.

I stopped walking. My hands shook. I could feel my pulse in my fingers.

I swung the light again.

This time the beam caught it.

Between two trees, half-hidden, a shape that was too tall to be a deer and too thin to be a bear. It was standing upright, but not like a person stands. Its posture was wrong, weight distributed like it wasn’t used to its own joints.

Its torso was narrow and too long. Its arms hung low, almost to its knees. The head was the worst part, because my brain kept trying to label it and failing. It wasn’t antlers like the stories. It wasn’t a clean skull. It looked like skin pulled tight over something sharp. The top had uneven ridges like bone pushing out from inside.

Two dull reflective points caught my light, not bright like animal eyes, but wet and heavy.

It tilted its head.

Then it took one step toward me.

Not loud. Not charging. Just a single, confident step that erased distance too quickly.

I ran.

I ran because I didn’t have a better idea.

The trail pitched down and twisted. My phone light bounced wildly. My breathing turned into ragged pulls. Behind me, I heard movement through brush that didn’t sound panicked. It sounded like it knew exactly where it was going.

The radio in my fist hissed.

“Don’t run,” the voice said.

It didn’t sound worried. It sounded irritated, like I’d stopped playing the game correctly.

My phone light died in the middle of a step.

One second I had a cone of visibility, the next I was in full dark.

I nearly faceplanted. My arms flailed. My foot caught a root. I stumbled, recovered, and kept moving with only the green glow of the radio screen.

The creature’s clicking breath stayed with me. Sometimes louder, sometimes fainter, like it was pacing me from the side.

I tried to slow down to save my ankle, but the moment I did, the clicking got closer.

I ran again.

The trail dipped hard. My foot hit something slick. I went down on my hands and knees. Pain shot up my right wrist like a spark. My knee slammed a root. I bit my tongue and tasted blood.

I pushed up fast, panicked, and my right ankle rolled on loose needles.

A clean, sharp pain climbed my leg and almost took me down again. I had to catch myself against a tree trunk.

I couldn’t put my full weight on that foot anymore.

Behind me, the clicking stopped.

For one breathless second, I thought maybe it had paused. Maybe it had decided I wasn’t worth it.

Then I felt it behind me. Not in a mystical way. In the way you feel a person standing too close in an elevator. Air pressure. Heat. Presence.

I turned, lifting the radio screen like a useless flashlight.

The green glow caught a piece of its face and shoulder.

Up close it wasn’t just thin. It looked damaged. Skin torn and healed wrong, like something had ripped it and it had closed back up without care. The mouth was pulled too wide, lips stretched tight, teeth crowded and uneven like they’d grown in wrong.

It reached toward me with those long, jointed fingers.

I swung the radio at it as hard as I could. Plastic cracked against something solid. The radio flew out of my hand and skittered into the dark.

The creature didn’t flinch.

It grabbed my left forearm.

The grip wasn’t wet or slimy like horror movies. It was cold and dry, like grabbing a dead branch. The pressure was immediate, crushing. Pain bloomed so fast it turned my vision white.

I screamed.

I yanked back, twisting. It dragged me a step like I weighed nothing. Its fingers tightened and I felt something in my arm give in a way that made me nauseous.

My free hand fumbled in my jacket pocket and found the one thing I’d thrown in there without thinking: a cheap road flare. I’d packed it because it was small and because I’d told myself, “It can’t hurt.”

My fingers shook so badly I almost dropped it.

I popped the cap, scraped the tip, and for half a second nothing happened and I thought I’d just died doing something stupid.

Then it lit.

A violent red flame, hissing, bright enough to turn the trees into hard-edged black silhouettes.

The creature jerked back like the light hit it physically. Its grip loosened. Not a full release, but enough.

I ripped my arm free and stumbled backward, holding the flare out between us like a spear.

In the red light I saw more of it. Legs too long. Knees bending in a way that looked half backwards. Skin mottled like bruises under thin flesh. Dark stains around its mouth that weren’t fresh but weren’t old enough to be nothing.

It didn’t charge.

It watched the flare with the same tilted-head curiosity, clicking softly.

Then it did something that snapped the situation into a new, colder shape.

It looked past the flare.

Down at the ground.

Toward where the radio had slid.

It took a slow step toward it, careful, like it didn’t want to get close to the flare.

Another step.

It wasn’t focused on me. It wanted the radio.

My throat tightened. I backed away, flare held out, and realized the “ranger” voice hadn’t been trying to save me. It had been trying to keep me moving, keep me talking, keep me transmitting.

Like a lure.

Like a line it could follow.

The creature crouched, long limbs folding wrong, and picked up the radio with those stick-like fingers. It turned it over as if it understood what it was holding.

Then the radio clicked.

And from the speaker, not from my hand now but from the thing’s hand, came the voice again.

Calm. Patient.

“Describe what you see.”

The creature lifted its head, still holding the radio, and the dull reflective points of its eyes turned to me.

I felt my stomach drop through the floor.

I didn’t wait to see what it would do next. I turned and limped away as fast as my ankle would let me, flare burning down in my hand, my left arm throbbing and numb where it had grabbed me.

The clicking breath moved with me, not rushing, not fading. Just staying close enough to remind me it could.

The flare shortened quickly, heat biting my palm. Red sparks spat into the dark.

I forced myself to follow the trail because stepping off into the trees felt like stepping off a dock at night. You don’t know what you’ll hit until you do.

Ahead, through the trees, I saw something angular and straight. Not a branch. Not a trunk.

A signpost.

I limped toward it and almost cried when I saw the reflective letters catch the flare light.

TRAIL 6

SERVICE ROAD 0.4

RANGER STATION 1.2

My brain snagged on that last line.

RANGER STATION.

Deeper.

Not out.

The flare hissed lower. The light dimmed.

From off to my right, through the trees, I heard the radio again.

A little burst of static.

A click.

Then my own voice, thin and distant, as if someone had learned the shape of it and was practicing.

“Ranger station… do you copy?”

I froze.

The sound didn’t come from behind. It came from the side, like it was trying to draw my attention off the trail. Toward the trees. Toward the direction that sign said “RANGER STATION.”

My chest tightened hard enough to hurt.

I turned my face away from the sound and forced my feet to move toward “SERVICE ROAD 0.4.”

Every step on that ankle was a bright spike of pain. My left arm felt heavy and wrong. I could feel bruising spreading under my skin.

The flare died with a wet sputter.

Darkness swallowed everything.

I stood still for a second because my eyes were useless and my panic was loud. Then I heard it again. The clicking breath, closer, patient.

I moved.

I walked by feel, hands out, fingertips catching branches, following the faint line of packed dirt underfoot. I slipped once on loose gravel and almost went down. I caught myself against a tree and felt bark dig into my scraped palm.

The radio crackled in the trees.

Sometimes it was static. Sometimes it was my voice repeating the same few words. Sometimes it was that calm “ranger” voice saying, “You’re almost there.”

After what felt like an hour but was probably ten minutes, the ground changed under my boots.

Gravel.

Then flat, hard-packed gravel.

A road.

I stepped forward and the tree line opened just enough that I could make out a darker shape ahead.

A metal gate.

I stumbled to it and grabbed it with both hands like it was a lifeline. The metal was cold. I pressed my forehead to it and pulled in air that tasted like rust and sap.

Behind me, the radio static swelled.

Close.

I turned slowly.

I couldn’t see it in the dark, but I could hear it. The clicking breath, a soft scrape of something moving through brush just off the road, staying in the cover of trees.

The radio clicked.

“Open the gate,” the voice said.

It didn’t sound like a ranger anymore. It sounded strained, like the words were being forced out through a mouth that didn’t fit them.

“I can’t,” I whispered, because my brain was still treating it like a conversation.

“Open it,” the voice repeated.

And under the words, the clicking breath accelerated, excited.

I backed away from the gate, then stopped, because backing away meant stepping closer to the sound.

I stood in the middle of the service road, gravel under my boots, and tried to think.

Cars used service roads. Rangers used service roads. If I followed it long enough, I’d hit something. A lot. A building. A sign. Anything.

Staying still felt like waiting to be taken.

I chose movement.

I limped down the road, faster than my ankle wanted, gravel crunching underfoot. To my right, in the tree line, something moved with me, quiet and effortless.

Every few seconds, the radio voice tried a new angle.

“Turn back.”

“You’re going the wrong way.”

“Your car is not there.”

Then, softer, using my voice again, like it was trying to sound concerned.

“Hey… hey… where are you?”

I didn’t answer. I bit down on my tongue and kept moving.

The road curved. The trees thinned.

And then, ahead, I saw the faint outline of a vehicle.

My car.

The pull-off.

I almost fell from relief. My hands shook so badly I dropped my keys once, then found them by feel and hit the unlock button.

The beep sounded like the best noise I’ve ever heard.

I got the driver’s door open and folded into the seat, dragging my bad ankle in like it didn’t belong to me. Pain flashed up my leg. I slammed the door and locked it.

For a second, I sat there in the dark, breathing hard, staring straight ahead like that would keep me safe.

Then I looked at my side mirror.

At the edge of the pull-off, where gravel met trees, something stood half-hidden in the brush.

Tall. Too thin. Motionless.

In one hand, a small green glow.

My radio.

It lifted the radio slightly, as if showing it to me.

Then the speaker crackled.

And the voice that came out was mine, careful and patient, exactly the way I’d sounded when I thought help was real.

“Ranger station… do you copy?”

I turned the key.

The engine coughed, then caught. The dashboard lit up.

The headlights snapped on, bright white, flooding the pull-off.

The brush at the edge of the trees was empty.

No movement. No shape. No glowing radio.

Just branches and shadow.

I didn’t wait. I threw the car into reverse, gravel spraying, and drove like I was late for my own funeral.

I didn’t stop until I hit pavement. I didn’t stop until I saw another vehicle’s taillights. I didn’t stop until I found the park office, a dark building with a big sign and an emergency phone mounted on the wall.

I called.

I told the person on the other end that I was injured, lost, and something had chased me. I didn’t say “wendigo.” I didn’t say “monster.” I said “an animal” because I needed them to send someone and I didn’t want to sound insane.

They told me to stay in my car with the doors locked until a ranger arrived.

A ranger truck rolled in twenty minutes later. Light bar flashing, tires crunching. The ranger was young, maybe late twenties, and he had the exhausted posture of someone who’d already worked a full day and then got pulled into someone else’s mistake.

He walked up to my window and I rolled it down an inch. I didn’t mean to, but the second I saw a uniform my throat tightened and my eyes burned.

He took one look at my hands and my ankle and swore under his breath.

“Jesus,” he muttered. “Okay. Okay. You did the right thing coming here.”

He helped me into his truck. The heater blew air that smelled like coffee and old vinyl. My body started shaking now that the danger was gone enough for my nerves to catch up.

On the drive to the clinic in the nearest town, he asked me what happened.

I told him the clean version first. Lost the trail. Radioed for help. Got turned around. Something grabbed me.

I didn’t talk about the voice using my voice until the words fell out by accident.

“It repeated me,” I said, staring at my bruised arm. “Like… like it was throwing my words back.”

The ranger’s hands tightened on the steering wheel.

“What channel were you on?” he asked.

“Seven,” I said. “The ranger frequency.”

His eyes flicked to me, quick.

“That’s not ranger dispatch,” he said.

My mouth went dry. “Then who answered me?”

He didn’t answer right away. He watched the road ahead like he was reading it.

Finally he said, “Nobody should have.”

The clinic wrapped my ankle, checked my wrist, cleaned the scrapes on my palms. The bruises on my forearm had started to bloom dark purple by then, finger-shaped, too long. The nurse asked if I’d gotten caught in wire.

I nodded because it was easier than explaining I’d been grabbed by something that didn’t move like a person.

When I came out, the ranger was still there. He stood by his truck with his hands in his jacket pockets like he didn’t want to leave me alone to walk to my car.

“Did you find my radio?” I asked, and I hated how small my voice sounded.

He shook his head. “No.”

I swallowed. “Is there… is there an old ranger station out there? Like an actual tower?”

He hesitated, then sighed like he’d made a decision.

“There’s a decommissioned lookout,” he said. “Old structure. Not staffed. We don’t use it.”

“So the voice could’ve been someone messing with me,” I said, trying to find a normal explanation to cling to.

He looked tired, and for a second he looked older than he was.

“It’s possible,” he said. “But listen to me. If you ever camp again, you do not call for help on random channels. You call the emergency number. You stay put. You don’t let a voice tell you to walk deeper. You understand?”

I nodded.

He leaned closer, lowering his voice like the night could hear us.

“And if you hear your own voice come back at you,” he added, “you stop transmitting.”

I stared at him.

“You’ve heard that?” I asked.

He didn’t answer directly. He just said, “Dispatch got weird traffic tonight. On that channel. We thought it was interference at first.”

“What kind of traffic?”

He rubbed his jaw like he didn’t want to say it.

“A man asking for help,” he said finally. “Saying he was lost. Saying he was on Trail Six.”

My stomach dropped.

“That was me,” I whispered.

He shook his head once.

“No,” he said. “It started before you called. And it kept going after you stopped.”

I didn’t sleep that night. Not really. I lay in my apartment with my ankle propped up and my forearm throbbing and I kept hearing that clicking breath in the back of my head, like my brain had recorded it and didn’t know how to delete it.

Two days later, in daylight, I went back to the park office. I told myself I was going to file a report about the radio. I told myself I wanted closure.

The woman behind the counter was older, hair pulled back, eyes sharp in the way people get after years of dealing with strangers who don’t read rules.

I gave her my name and the date. She typed into her computer. Her nails clicked against the keys.

“No lost property matching that,” she said.

I nodded like I expected it.

Then I asked, carefully, “Do you get… strange radio calls? People using the wrong channel?”

Her eyes shifted, just a fraction, to a binder on the desk behind her. A plain three-ring binder with a white label strip.

She didn’t reach for it. She didn’t have to.

“There are signs in the brochure kiosk,” she said, voice neutral. “About emergency procedures.”

“I saw those,” I said. “They don’t mention radio channels.”

Her expression didn’t change, but her tone did. It got flatter.

“We don’t provide radio channels,” she said. “Not anymore.”

“Why?”

She stared at me for a moment like she was deciding how much truth a stranger deserved.

Then she slid a piece of laminated paper across the counter. Not a brochure. Not a map. Something that looked like it had been printed in-house and updated a hundred times.

It had one line in bold at the top:

DO NOT REQUEST ASSISTANCE OVER UNMONITORED FREQUENCIES.

Below that were three bullet points. Short. Clinical.

	•	If you are lost, stay on trail and stay put.

	•	Use emergency phones or call 911 if service is available.

	•	If you hear a voice directing you off-trail, do not respond.

My mouth went dry.

“That’s a weird thing to have to print,” I said.

She didn’t smile.

“It became necessary,” she said.

I tried to speak. My throat felt tight.

“Has anyone… been hurt?” I asked.

She paused long enough that my stomach sank again, then said, “People get found. People don’t get found. Same as any park.”

She reached under the counter and pulled out a small plastic bag.

Inside was a handheld radio. Not mine. Different brand. Same cheap shape. Mud dried into the grooves.

She set it on the counter like evidence.

“We find these sometimes,” she said. “Not often. Usually they’re dead. Sometimes they’re still on.”

I stared at it.

“What do you do when they’re still on?” I asked.

Her eyes met mine.

“We turn them off,” she said. “And we don’t stand there listening.”

I left after that. I didn’t argue. I didn’t ask for the location of the decommissioned lookout. I didn’t ask about the binder. I didn’t want to.

I drove home with both hands tight on the wheel and the irrational feeling that if I relaxed my grip, the car would drift into the trees.

Here’s the last thing I’ll say, because it’s the part I can’t explain away.

Last night, I was cleaning out my pack. Shaking dirt out of the seams. Counting what I’d lost.

I found the flare wrapper in a side pocket and the edge of the paper map, folded wrong from when I’d yanked it out. I found a smear of dried blood on the strap where my wrist scraped it when I fell.

And tucked into the smallest inside pocket, the one I never use, I found a strip of reflective tape.

The same kind that had been on the ground.

Damp. Cold, even though it had been inside my apartment for days.

When I held it up to the light, I saw something stuck to the adhesive.

A single dark hair, coarse and stiff, like it didn’t belong to any animal I know.

I threw the tape away. I took the trash out immediately. I washed my hands until my skin was raw.

And later, lying in bed with my ankle throbbing and my arm bruised and my phone charging on the nightstand, I heard a sound that made my whole body lock up.

A soft burst of static.

A click.

Not from outside. Not from the woods.

From somewhere in my apartment, close enough that I could hear the tiny speaker distortion.

Then, very quietly, my own voice, patient and calm, asking the same question it asked the night I thought help was real.

I’m American and recently arrived abroad Scotland, and I went on a first date with a guy here. We meet on a dating app. We met for coffee. He didn’t offer to pay (I paid £3 for my own coffee), which I know can be normal outside the US — but what threw me off was everything else. 

He didn’t hold doors open, walked ahead of me,  didn’t offer a hand when I was wearing a skirt and walking down steep steps (this is just a polite thing to do), and when we were walking on the street he let me walk on the side closest to traffic. He also wiped his mouth with his sleeve at one point, which really stood out to me.

I even offered to pay for *his* coffee at one point and he didn’t really react either way.

In the US, behavior like this would usually signal that a guy isn’t interested or doesn’t find you attractive. That’s what’s messing with my head — I can’t tell if this is just cultural difference, low effort, or if I somehow don’t meet beauty standards here.

What’s confusing is that after the “date,” he texted saying we should get a beer sometime (I declined).

So I guess my question is:

* Is this normal dating behavior here?
* Is this just a mismatch / bad manners?
* Am I misreading this through an American lens?
* Also how do I know if I meet the beauty standard here...who will give me an honest opinion. Maybe I am just not attractive by Scottish standards (this is fine) just wanna know. 

I’d appreciate honest perspectives. Thanks! ",0,1768163399.0,Scotland,70,0.13,False
1qaa4gu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qaa4gu,St-Regis Chicago. Had one free night. December 12 (an essay 😁),"Ex Four Seasons employee here. I was able to use my benefits and secure 5 free nights at the Four Seasons in Chicago. 

My first day was oversold, so I was walked to the St-Regis instead.

This was also my first luxury hotel experience EVER, so this experience was definitely grander than my past hotel experiences. 

However, as a luxury hotel employee, I was able to nitpick (not that I like to) and spot the little things that may have disrupted my guest experience a little bit.

I was given a Grand Deluxe room, not entirely sure what grade that is, but it was huge, maybe too huge for a lil guy like me lollllll (not complaining tho).

I only stayed a single night because I had to check in to the FS the next day. I arrived at 5pm.
Didn’t have much time to use the spa or the pool. Gym was spacious, liked it!

The entrance was gorgeous, check-in was smooth, the guy checking me in was incredibly nice and I didn’t feel judged by any staff member at all, considering I was wearing grey sweatpants with a jacket over a hoodie.

I was given the card to my room, walked in the elevator, and that’s when it kicked in - I’m staying at a fucking St-Regis baby!!!

When I got to my room, I was absolutely SHOCKED at how big it was. When traveling, I was raised to only pick the cheapest and the essential when booking flights and hotels. Always the rooms on the bottom floor, the economy flights, etc.

The bathroom was gorgeous, took a selfie - had to draw over it because I wasn’t fully clothed 🫢. The bathroom had a window that overlooked the bedroom, which gave you the possibility to have a view if you were bathing. The shidder and the shower were in separate sub-rooms within the bathroom.

So far, I felt awwweeeesome, I felt like king!!

Some girl at the reception desk had a little bit of an attitude which kind of shattered the “honeymoon” phase of my stay here. I came down to ask question regarding reservations, walked to the front desk, she looked busy so I waited until she was finished doing what she was. She stared at me and gave me a loud “Hello?” after a good 3 seconds. It felt awkward and felt like she didn’t want to help.

Anyway, it was a Saturday night, so Tre Dita and Miru were both at full capacity, but they managed to secure me a spot at the Miru sushi bar.

I wasn’t too hungry but I still wanted to try the food. Got the popcorn shrimp tempura and the salmon truffle. Very disappointed lol, sorry. Paid 65USD ish on my total bill for these two things. Salmon was a bit bland, truffle didn’t taste like truffle. Shrimp balls are very basic, you could get that same taste anywhere else.

The next morning, went back for Miru for breakfast. Staff was incredibly nice, but Maitre D did not smile a single second. Servers were awesome. Chia pudding was good, well it’s just chia pudding right? Had a vanilla iced coffee, quite good as well.

Anyway, had to left a few hours later. Lady checking me out was INCREDIBLE. I made sure to give her a good word (forgot her name).

Overall, 7/10.

Everything was great, if not for the food and the rude girl at the desk.

Would I come back? No, because I’m a broke boy 🥴

I also have an updated fork of AtlasLoot for retail, so it made sense to maintain ALC as well. I've updated my fork for TBC and included the content phase for specific items, which even the original didn't have. I also added the items for Season of Discovery and integrated them into each list (unlike the original ALC SoD fork). SoD items will only be loaded on SoD, in Classic Era you'll only see Vanilla loot.

Going forward, I'll continue to update ALC for Vanilla and TBC (and WOTLK and Classic+ if they happen). I'm also considering giving ALC a UI update like I did for AtlasLoot in retail, so that it matches the default UI. But I realize that maybe ALC's look is part of the Classic feel, so I'd be interested in people's thoughts on a UI update.

I’ve been a Deadhead since I first heard “Uncle John’s Band” when I was 14; Bob and the rest of the boys have brought immense adventure, insight and, above all, pleasure, in the many years since. About a decade ago, I realized that Bob’s last name rhymes with a ton of words, including: Beer, Bier, Cheer, Clear, Bier, Dear, Deer, Ear, Fear, Gear, Hear, Here, Jeer, Meer, Near, Peer, Pier, Queer, Rear, Schmear, Sere, Smear, Sneer, Spear, Sphere, Steer, Tear, Tier, Veer, We’re, Year, and, of course, Weir (maybe not a rhyme, but still).

I thought it would be cool to design images of Bob that played off his name. Unfortunately, I have zero artistic talent. I never did anything about it until last year when I told my daughters about this idea. One of them, Amelia, used Chap GPT to create a Bob Beer coffee mug and a Bob Fear t-shirt for my birthday. This Christmas I got more mugs, including Bob Schmear and Bob Sneer.

Anyway, it would be cool if one of the ways Heads honored Bob and his off-kilter sense of humor was by creating their own images.

Maybe I was naive but I’ve used the K2 and had to go more coarse than any online recommendations because of my pressurised basket. The very first shot I pulled with it with 25 clicks, no liquid actually came out, which is embarrassing to even type. I’ve done some research since and realise the one thing that’s holding me back from making a decent shot is the basket. Also the coffee is so hard to bang out into the bin afterwards which I suspect is from the pressure build up.

So my porta filter is 54mm wide and the current basket when I take out all the attachments is 53mm wide and 200mm deep. Can I get away with buying just a basket for my machine or do I need a new porta filter altogether? I don’t mind either way but would rather just get the basket if I can. It’s a breville one touch machine which is nothing too special.

I have a metal puck screen which I’m not sure is adding anything really.

2025 In Review – A Canine Perspective","In putting this recap together, I realized how fast time is passing and what little I remember doing, seeing, and smelling even a few months ago. Is this what “aging” feels like?

In picking out the best moments from each month, I want to remind readers that this selection of images is coming from a canine perspective, and one that was a long-term resident of our animal shelter. Food, smells, and supporting my brothers and sisters in the shelter are my passions. Let’s get started.

January

Until I was hired as the roving reporter and had the opportunity to really see our island community, I had never seen a turkey let along an entire rafter. Judging solely by their appearance, I always assumed they were flightless. According to the NASA website, one needs the right “object”, “motion”, and “air” to be able to generate lift. To me, these representatives of the genus Meleagris are objectively too heavy to fly and could never generate enough forward motion to create lift. Just ask any driver that has encountered a flock walking down Central Avenue. So slow. 

In January, I had a Wright Brothers moment when I saw a turkey run down Alameda Avenue, achieve rotation velocity, deploy a huge wingspan, and flap its way onto a pine tree branch 60 feet in the air dispelling the myth that these guys couldn’t fly. Nature is amazing.

February

This is my Gotch Month, and I returned to the FAAS shelter I resided in for over seven months for a reunion and cake eating activity. It was great to see many of the folks that took such good care of me during my stay. 

March

At the end of February, my human companion had a partial knee replacement and couldn’t take me out on walks. Luckly for me, Karen and Dan Platt offered to take the noon time shift. They made a good team. Karen kept a lookout for other dogs, cats, and squirrels while Dan acted like a great weight to keep me from running off. I was very grateful for that midday walk.

April

This month marked another first for me. While walking along Shoreline Drive, I experienced my first major earthquake or so I thought. As it turned out, it was not an earthquake at all. When I turned onto Grand Avenue, I saw this big, tall crane with a pile driver attachment that ran eight hours a day, five days a week. All I could think about was the poor neighbors living across the street.

 May

After reading about the groundbreaking of the FAAS veterinarian hospital called Animal Medical Services and Training Campus in the Harbor Bay Business Park, I set up a tour with John Lipp (center) to see how things were shaping up. I got a chance to get a tour of the construction by Leslie Denham – the project manager- (left) and meet the soon to be new executive director Adrien Abuyen (right).

June

 I don’t recall the exact day I explored the northern waterfront from Grand Street and north along the Bay Trail to Pasta Pelican. However, I can tell you the exact location of the Mosley’s Café dog treat jar. It’s a great little walk that takes one by the floating home community.

July

The beginning of July is always stressful for me due to all the noise caused by the fireworks. However, there is nothing like a fresh hot dog from Alameda’s iconic purveyor of this classic American staple. Minus the onions of course.

August

I think the most fun I ever had researching for a report was the round-a-bout story. It was crazy fun going round and round, and I didn't even get car sick and throw up. It was an awesome day that I will not soon forget.

September

Alameda saw record temperatures this month, and residents sought out cool locations to beat the heat. While some folks had iced coffee drinks at Julie’s Coffee & Tea or headed down to Crab Cove, me and HC hit the tiki bar called Forbidden Island. Hanging out in our matching German Shephard Hawaiian shirts was a true bonding experience.

October              

The best month of the entire year has got to be October, because the holiday of all holidays is on the 31^(st). This year, I had my HC make me a Shephard’s Pie costume. Special thanks to John Thiel -owner of Pappo Pizza- for allowing me to use the restaurant for the photo shoot. By the way, you need to try one of his pizzas.

November

Thanksgiving is a time for expressing gratitude for what we have in our lives, but for those canines in the shelter, it is hard to be grateful when you don’t have a forever home. This is why I chose this month to pay it forward and prepare special treats for all the dogs having to spend Thanksgiving in the shelter.

December

December can be a real 💩 show with folks driving crazy, Doordash and PRIME drivers double parking everywhere, and everyone frantically shopping for “stuff.” But, I have found the true meaning of the holidays by taking on the role of Santa Paws. I made sure that every dog at FAAS received a Christmas stocking to hang in their kennel and that the real Santa Paws filled each one with lots of treats and toys.

While I am only eleven days into the new year, so far things are going great. It’s an election year, and I will be making my run for mayor. Watch for my official announcement soon.

 I want to wish everyone a healthy and prosperous 2026

So I'm the sous chef of a restaurant and I've been tasked with teaching our FOH staff (who are a great group, but very much NOT baristas) how to better care for our espresso machine. I know normal home use stuff but want to make sure I'm not missing anything major. I'm really looking for basic daily cleaning as well as anything that should be taken care of on weekly/monthly intervals.

The machine is a Wega two group and it is plumbed in. They do cafiza when someone thinks about it but that's about it. We pull maybe 15 shots on our busiest nights, so it's getting a fair amount of use but no where near what a coffee shop would be doing out of it.

I also need to replace the group head gaskets, do I need to know anything specific here or is E61 standard across the board?

If I’m buying makeup, there’s a spreadsheet-level thought process behind it. I’ve only got Walmart nearby, and even then I mostly shop online because shipping math usually works in my favor if I’m patient enough. Over time, I realized that putting together a complete makeup kit doesn’t require a huge upfront haul, it just requires timing. I always check Walmart prices first, then hop over to Amazon to see if they’ve matched it. That’s usually where the magic happens, especially once Subscribe & Save discounts kick in. No Prime needed, no shipping fees, just some waiting and a bit of planning. I clip coupons obsessively, especially the random “first order” or extra percentage-off deals that stack without much effort. That’s how my basics slowly came together. Micellar water for almost half price. Drugstore lip products that cost less than a coffee. Mascara that didn’t make me question my life choices at checkout. I even found brush sets and organizers while browsing Alibaba during price comparisons, which helped round things out affordably. This might sound like extreme bargain hunting, but if you’re piecing together a complete makeup kit without wrecking your budget, it’s surprisingly satisfying. And honestly, kind of fun.

I loved it! The variety of expesso-like drinks I could make were welcome (though I mostly just do flat whites) and the coffee is..OK.  Good enough.  Period.  

Then in late October, it said it needed to be descaled.  I bought the Nespresso brand descaler (pack of 2) and ran descaling.  After that it was OK again.  Then I noticed it started to be erratic in the volume of coffee it makes and then it started to not puncture the top of the pod resulting in little-to no coffee.    
  
I called Nespresso support in November.  Spent 90 minutes going through troubleshooting and cleaning instructions.  After a second descale (with no descaler - just a flush) it worked again.  The support person marked the problem as fixed and sent me on my way.

A month later, I got another descale notice.  You cannot ignore it and brew a beverage anyway.  So I ran another descale (this would be like the 3rd or 4th since the October support call!).  That lasted 3 days before another descale message came on.

I've called support again and they seem to insist on doing the trouble shooting again - insisting that fixed the issue last time.    

I believe I have a faulty unit.  I don't have hard water and I have cleaned the unit (scrubbing inside puncture area with tooth brush and clearing nozzels with toothpick/pin!!) as support said should be done.. (weekly!).

At this point, I'm ready for them to make good on the 2-year warranty.  

  
Has anyone had similar issues?

Note, the last descale, I used a stronger white vinegar based solution in hopes that a stronger descaler would help clear the problem.  At this point, I think there may be an issue with the flow meter or thermoblock sensor.",2,1768162990.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

I'm a 19-year-old girl and very much an introvert. Big groups tire me out fast, small talk feels awkward and empty, and I need a lot of time by myself to feel balanced and like myself again. I've come to really value this part of who I am, but lately I've been wishing for someone who shares the same kind of energy. Someone I can connect with slowly and naturally, without any pressure to be outgoing, energetic, or always available.

I'm in college right now, mostly focused on classes and keeping things simple. In my free time I love reading (fantasy series that pull me into other worlds, or quieter books with deep characters), watching movies and shows that take their time with the story and the feelings, listening to soft music like lo-fi, ambient, or gentle indie while I journal random thoughts or just stare out the window. I enjoy making tea or coffee exactly the way I like it, going for walks when it's not too busy outside, and letting my mind wander without any rush. Loud places, crowded events, and constant plans make me feel drained very quickly. I recharge best in peace and solitude.

I'm not looking for someone who wants to change how I am or bring me into a busier, more social life. What I'm hoping to find is another introvert who understands it without explanation. Someone comfortable with long silences that don't feel uncomfortable, who prefers one real conversation over a lot of surface ones, who would be happy spending time together in low-key ways like reading in the same space, sharing playlists or book thoughts, watching something calm side by side, or talking about whatever feels meaningful when the moment is right. I think two introverts can create something very gentle and solid because we both respect the need for space and choose closeness carefully.

I'd like to hear from guys around 18 to 24 who feel the same about being introverted. You don't have to be super shy or have social anxiety, just someone who naturally recharges alone, thinks things through, and values depth and calm over constant activity or frequent plans. Distance isn't a problem if the connection feels genuine and we communicate openly.

If this sounds like it could fit you, feel free to message me whenever you're ready. Maybe share something small about yourself, like what you enjoy doing when you're alone, a book or song that's been on your mind lately, or what your perfect quiet day looks like. No need to reply right away or be especially talkative at first. We can go as slow as we both need, starting with simple messages and seeing if it feels right. I'm just hoping to find one person who makes the quiet feel a little warmer and less empty. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",0,1768162801.0,IntrovertDating,3,0.43,False
1qa9veg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DrummerSlight6205/comments/1qa9veg/chess_story/,Chess story,"When I transferred to my new school, I decided on one rule: stay invisible. New schools love labels—smart kid, athlete, tryhard, chess prodigy—and I had worn that last one before and was tired of it. So when I joined the chess club a few weeks late, I made sure no one expected anything from me. I sat in the back, spoke only when spoken to, and played like I barely knew what I was doing. I missed mate-in-ones, traded queens for no reason, and lost games in under ten minutes. People noticed. They laughed when I hung my rook and smirked when I asked what opening we were supposed to be learning. Someone even leaned over once and said, “It’s okay, you’ll get better with practice,” and I nodded and thanked them. What they didn’t know was that chess had been part of my life for years—early mornings, late nights, tournaments in hotel ballrooms that smelled like coffee and stress, coaches correcting my endgames, and state championships where one mistake meant everything was over. At my old school, my name was on pairing sheets and people prepared for me, but here I wanted none of that. As weeks passed, I slowly stopped throwing every game. I still lost sometimes, but now my losses were close and my wins were quiet, with no flashy sacrifices, just solid moves. A few people started to notice something was off. Someone asked how I was suddenly better, and I said I was just practicing. When the state championship came around, I was barely talked about—low seed, no hype, the kind of player you hope to face in round one—and that’s exactly what happened. That was when I stopped pretending. In my first game, I played clean and controlled with no mistakes, and halfway through the middlegame my opponent frowned because he could feel it slipping away. By the endgame, there was nothing he could do, and it ended in checkmate. The same thing happened in the next round and the next. Word spread, people started watching my games, the jokes stopped, coaches whispered, and opponents showed up nervous, overthinking every move because they didn’t understand how the “noob” had made it this far. By the finals, the room was packed, and I faced the top seed, the player everyone expected to win. He played aggressively, trying to intimidate me early, but I stayed calm because I had seen it all before. One mistake and one quiet move later, his position collapsed. When his clock ran out and he tipped his king, the room went silent. I shook his hand, signed the scoresheet, and walked away with the state championship. I never learned chess at this school; I just let everyone believe I didn’t know it until it mattered most.",1,1768162768.0,u_DrummerSlight6205,0,1.0,False

On a good day I can load the dishwasher and make the bed without puking. Other days, like today, I do nothing but sleep, sleep, eat a lil and sleep. My arms and legs feel like lead and no rest seem to fix 

Coffee makes me puke so I’ve had to quit that. I’m eating plenty of fruit and fresh vegetables (kind of a craving rn) and I’m taking my prenatals plus extra magnesium in the evenings. I haven’t had my first meeting with the doctor yet but I’ll definitely bring this up.

In the mean time, is there anything I can do? Any tips or hacks? Or do I just gotta soldier on through the trimester?",10,1768162692.0,pregnant,15,1.0,False

For context, I (just turned 24 F) just moved to a new city and started a new serving job. I’ve been struggling to make friends in this area since it’s mainly retired people or families. I have other friends closer to age but they live a couple hours away so it has been difficult to arrange hangouts because of work, life, etc. I met a couple of girls at my new job (20F, 18F, 19F) who I get along with great and have similar sense of humor and interests. We all got together outside of work to grab coffee and chit chat which was super fun! All of my other coworkers are 30-50y/o who are problematic and gossip about each other 24/7 so I tend to not talk as much with them. They want to plan more hangouts like movies, thrifting, etc but I’m worried that it’s a bit of an age gap and I will be viewed as that weird older person that hangs out with younger crowds (I’m the youngest out of all of my other friends so it’s not a common thing for me) We don’t do anything illegal like drink or smoke, just hangout and talk.

Before explaining the situation, here’s a quick intro about me.

I’m a 30-year-old software engineer, working a regular 9–5. I’m married to a lovely wife and I’m from North Africa.

You know those moments during the day when you’re doing something completely routine; like making coffee in the morning, and suddenly a train of thoughts hits you all at once?

In that exact moment, I might be thinking about:

\- a task I need to finish at work

\- a broken chair I should fix at home

\- a side project I’m building

\- a new feature I *really* want to add

\- and somehow… entirely new project ideas I suddenly feel like starting right now



The problem is when I finally sit down to do some proper work, everything disappears.

It feels like my head is full of messy cabinets and drawers. I ***know*** there's a lot in there, but I can't clearly grab anything. 

Sometimes I end up staring at the screen for an hour, doing almost nothing, no real work, no actual productive time.

I recently started questioning this because it genuinely feels like it's affecting my productivity and focus.



I don't know if anyone else experiences this.

Would really appreciate hearing how others handle this, if ever?",1,1768162621.0,Productivitycafe,2,1.0,False

1qa9snr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicDating/comments/1qa9snr/dating_in_2026/,Dating in 2026 😭,I feel like some people over spiritualize dating in Catholic groups. I’ve known guys who will sit around months praying on whether or not to take a girl on a date and I’ve even been told by guys that God “told them” they would end up with a girl but they’re just playing the long game. One guy was rejected over three times by a girl with a boyfriend but swears that because this girl just so happened to be lectoring at mass one day that it was a sign from God. I also know girls who will use God and various things as an excuse not to go on or continue dating dudes. I’ve seen girls reject guys over “discerning convent” or “not feeling called to date at the time” just to talk about him behind his back for being short or creepy and end up dating not long after lol. Please just tell us the truth if you aren’t interested. Men if you like a girl and she likes you just ask her out! Don’t use prayer and discernment as an excuse for your lack of action. Women if a guy ask you out and you don’t like him just say you’re not interested. Don’t say you’re “not ready to date” or that you “need to ask your spiritual director” if you can meet someone for coffee. Let your yes be yes and no be no.

My spouse and I recently started a little community non-profit studio/gallery where have open studio with some supplies, classes, a stage for shows (we've done some comedy, music, and improv events), we hang resident artists for three month seasons, and have other events. It's an easygoing place to sit down and get creative, grab some refreshments (we have some snacks and drinks, but you can bring your own or bring some from across the street at Subjective Coffee, who are our friends), and paint, draw, sculpt clay, whatever. We have some things to keep kids busy like playdough, coloring books, and little projects. We have music open mics on Fridays. We have stand-up open mics every other Thursday. We often have classes on weekends and are always open to it if folks want to run a class or an event.

We're a non-profit and while we encourage donations, many things like open studio are free. Our classes are not typically expensive and we sell our snacks cheap. Our main goal is to build community in this neck of the woods that is inclusive and hopefully a light hearted place for creatives to gather.

It is *technically* in Westminster, but is a stone's throw from the city limits of North Denver at 72nd and Lowell and isn't far from the US36 and Federal exit or a short walk from the Westminster RTD train station.

Stop by or let us know if you think of something you'd like to see us provide as a show, event, or class!",1,1768162484.0,DenverArtSeen,0,1.0,False

I’ve been there done that, and it feels pathetic, truly. It’s always been my dream to have a girlfriend to game with, talk about stuff with, listen to each other, go get a freaking coffee, but it’s just never truly worked out. I mean shit, I’ve gone as far as exchanging numbers before, and being invited to a possible future hangout, but it never ever comes to fruition. Any good friendship “online” I’ve had with a chick, ended with them leaving me for their other friend/s, and suddenly there’s never time for me. Joining a group doesn’t work out either, maybe it’s my age, who knows. Or perhaps I haven’t tried hard enough. 

Now, being honest, for me, I prefer to just use my free time and energy for my bf. I’m not a multi-person gal, never have been. I suppose I get a bit overly stimulated? Or awkward? But perhaps that’s my downfall. Eh, all I know is, he has his friends, and told me “Why don’t ya join a server or read a book?” This made me feel a bit stupid. It’s time I make effort in putting my time and energy into someone else, and myself, SO

If you’d like to chat, hit me up. I’m currently watching Newsroom, as I read it was similar to Succession (one of my favorite shows). I don’t really game much, but I like Apex Legends, Uno, 8Ball, Monopoly, and Minecraft, which are more fun with someone else, whom I do not have. So I rarely play. I have an Xbox and an iPhone. I’m also currently reading Silvertip’s Search, a western book by Max Brandy. I just finished “They All Died Screaming”, which I’d recommend if you like rough horror. I work mon-fri, 8-4, so there’s a sort of estimate for times I’m available. 

Looking forward to someone reaching out, let me know what your interests are and what brings you here, thank you if you read this far :)",1,1768162446.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,5,1.0,False
