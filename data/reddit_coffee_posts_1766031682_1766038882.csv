1ppjrdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheButtface/comments/1ppjrdk/wibtb_for_asking_my_boyfriend_about_the_girl_who/,WIBTB for asking my boyfriend about the girl who claims he's taken her out twice?,"boyfriend (18m) recently called me (18f) after one of his classes because a girl in his class (who i had heard about from him before, he didn't like her because she made class difficult for everyone) had forged screenshots of him flirting with her and she wanted him to either ""come clean"" and give her proof he told me, or she would reach out to me on insta. she had found his, and found mine through a tagged post. i didn't care nearly as much as he did, he was worried that i would believe her even tho i know he wouldn't do that.

 he reported her to campus police in case she tried anything else, we both blocked her insta, i didn't think twice about it.

more than a week later (yesterday) some other girl followed me and commented something under my most recent post ""blah blah ik this is weird but i have info blah blah dm me"" so i figured, since she put her friend up to it now, i would talk to her to make it clear i had no interest in what she had to say. it was a lot of ""your boyfriend is a liar and you don't deserve to be lied to"" vs ""i'm gonna need more than the word of two strangers vs the man i love"".

she gave me some story about ""he took her (the friend blackmailing (?) my bf) out to dinner and coffee and flirted with her constantly"" and i thought it was dumb because he has no time, he doesn't spend money rn unless it's taking me out or going out with his church guys, and this man has absolutely no clue how to flirt. i've watched him try. it's kind of sad, in an endearing way.

she was really insistent but i blew her off and got pretty unserious until she dropped it. i said a civil goodnight and blocked her. i ss'd the whole convo and sent it to my boyfriend, too.

i don't think he did it, and had a conversation earlier thanking him for being someone i could trust. i don't want him to think i've gone back on that. he's a good man who recognizes his mistakes and owns up to them. he knows he's lucky to have me, and i'm lucky enough to have someone who knows it.

however,, i still want to ask him about the things that girl said. just to check the mental box that i did ask him. i still want to ask, but i feel like i can't ask anything now that it's been handled, especially with how much of a cool, unbothered head i've handled this all with.

idk if this context helps, but he did mention the situation to my mom and sister when he was over once, so it's not like he's trying to keep it close to the chest. and he did let me know the first time they went to get coffee that he mentioned me, as his girlfriend, and she seemed disappointed ? idk,

tldr : someone threatened my boyfriend with fake ss's of him flirting and claimed he took her out multiple times, i don't believe her and already spoke to / shut her down myself & thanked my boyfriend for being a trustworthy man, but i still want to ask him questions about it, even though i do believe him.",1,1766038789.0,AmItheButtface,0,1.0,False

1ppjpse,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ppjpse,Need help with grinder,"I recently bought some specialty coffee beans from Paris and Brussels (origin - colombia and costa rica). Im unable to bring the same clarity i tasted at the cafe. 

My equipment:

1. Instacuppa burr electric grinder

2. V60 dripper with karafe

I tried different v60 recipes (hot) with coarser and finer, but couldn’t understand whats missing.

I suspect these two could be reasons

1. My grinder is producing too many fines or irregular grinds 

2. Resting - one of the baristas suggested me to rest for atleast 3 weeks, i rested only for a week. Will that affect this much?

Recipes i tried

1:16 - hoffman method - 50g/45s bloom - pour in intervals of 10-15s gap (+50g) until i reach 250g - drawdown \~3-3.30 mins - 89C temp

1:16 - chatgpt suggested - 45g/30s bloom - pour until 250g for 1.15 mins continuously - drawdown 2-30-3 mins - 92C

I tried with different grind sizes for above 2 recipes. (8,9,10 in instacuppa)

Can someone suggest what am I missing? If its grinder, please suggest me a good manual grinder around 10,000 rupees.

1ppjoil,https://www.reddit.com/r/askanything/comments/1ppjoil/am_i_doing_something_wrong/,Am I doing something wrong?,"Note: This is not meant to be a “woe is me” type thing so I apologize in advance if it comes off that way. I’m simply looking for some opinions of fellow people and their experiences. Also, if you want to skip the backstory and simply read what I’m asking about, I will separate the rambling into two sections.

CONTEXT/BACKSTORY For reference, I am a straight 19M, fading blonde hair and blue eyes, about 5’6”, around 165lbs and live in Missouri. I currently am attending a community college to get an associates degree with scholarship money. I work two jobs, one as a manager at a DQ and the other as an office worker at my old scoutmasters shop. I currently am living with my parents because I can’t afford to live on my own at the moment.

I have had exactly two relationships in my life, both occurring within the last 14 months (one only lasted a week, so really only on “real” relationship). I dated my most recent girlfriend (F17 at the time of break up, I was 18) for almost six months until she broke up with me. I won’t get into details, but she had some personal stuff going on in her life, and I had also said some things that made her upset and uneasy, and I regret that she felt slightly unsafe around me. (This was all told by a mutual friend after the breakup)

I would consider myself a humorous guy at heart. I always wanna make people laugh, mostly at the expense of myself or people whom I/we do not get along with. It is never my intention (with few exceptions) to hurt anyone with the things I say. However, I do sometimes happen to get out of line on occasion, but am usually brought back down to normal by myself or sometimes a close friend. I have to keep in mind the social circle I am in at the moment in time on how I respond to certain things, and sometimes I slip, but I am only human.

THE QUESTION I don’t exactly know what I’m trying to ask, and the title does make this sound a little vague and incel-ish. But I guess what I’m trying to ask is if my desire to get into a relationship is what’s holding me back from obtaining one? (I hope this makes sense to someone)

I would say, personally speaking, that most people could flip-flop on wether or not I am considered “conventionally attractive,” and I typically don’t approach women in public for a variety of reasons I make up at the moment or later after I kick myself for not saying anything. That’s why I kind of came around to trying out dating apps, as you can usually get a decent idea of a person based on how they describe themselves. However, I seem to have no luck with any of the 3 I currently use (Tinder, Duet, Coffee Meets Bagel). I have had maybe 3 or 4 genuine conversations total on these apps after using them for 3 1/2 months, and usually just end up getting depressed every time I swipe. I’ve lost count on how many times I’ve even swiped right because I seem to only swipe left anymore.

I wouldn’t say my standards are non-existent or extremely high. Typically, when viewing profiles or when I see women in public, I look for a few things…

1. ⁠How “healthy” is she - healthy might sound bad but it’s the only word I can use to properly describe what I mean. Basically, I want a woman who is not anorexic or overweight
2.	⁠Does she smoke/vape - as someone who was surround by smokers as a child, I cannot stand the smell of cigarettes, and I personally think capers look stupid with their USB looking shit sticking out of their mouths. I’ve come around on people who smoke weed (as long as it’s not your whole personality), but this is one thing I cannot compromise on
3.	⁠Actual woman - I am a straight man looking for a biological female. I am not physically attracted to trans people or the idea of being in a romantic relationship with a trans person
4.	⁠Age - I personally, as of now, would not date anyone under 17, or anyone over 26
5.	⁠Kids - I love kids and hope to have some someday, but I would prefer to not have to care for someone else’s (specifically like if the child’s dad is a deadbeat, I might be more willing if the father was dead or something)
6.	⁠Personality - have one. Would prefer someone not so obsessed with themselves or someone else like an ex, has a relatively low body count (mine is 0), has non-sexual relations with other men (I only mention this because most of my friends and people I talk to are women so I don’t know if that makes me look bad in the eyes of a woman), and has hobbies and things they like to do. I will gladly listen to ramblings about stuff she likes, even if I don’t fully grasp it

Now, I wanna be clear that I’m not desperate to be in a relationship, but I would like to be in one at some point, to a point in which we could marry and have children. My goal here is something life-long and meaningful. What I want is someone who will support me as much as I support them.

Well, if you actually took the time to read my ramblings, I thank you. And if you understood any part of that, I guess what I’m asking is: are my standard too high? Too low? Am I asking for too much? Am I not specific in what I want? Do I need to just approach women in public more often? Should I wait and let something find me?

Is it just me or am I doing something wrong?",1,1766038508.0,askanything,0,1.0,False
1ppjnmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelLinks/comments/1ppjnmu/falling_for_my_exs_brother/,Falling for My Ex’s Brother,"# Chapter 1 He Left For A Rich Girl

Aria's POV

I stood in front of the chapel.

Pink roses and white lilies decorated every corner. My favorite flowers.

The guests were already seated. Soon, at the end of the red carpet would stand the man I once loved, waiting to marry his bride.

Everything was perfect.

Except I wasn't the bride.

“I really need to see Jace today.”

I begged the bodyguard blocking the door. A beat-up suitcase and two boxes sat at my feet. Everything I owned in the world.

""No you don’t. Get out of here,"" the bodyguard said icily.

I saw disgust in his eyes. Yeah I get it. No one has sympathy for the crazy ex who shows up at the wedding.

But I have my reason to be here.

""If you don't let me see him, I'll just stand here and all the guests will see me,"" I threatened under my breath.

Jace wouldn't want that. Especially not today.

Because today, he was marrying Delilah Hart.

She is the sister to Alpha Grayson Hart of Redstone Pack. A 100% high-society darling.

All the guys in the world knew that marrying Delilah would totally change their lives, including Jace.

So he made the easy call—marrying the lady who could turn him from a small-town nobody into a golden boy. And dump the girl who stayed by his side for last 4 years when he had nothing.

He didn’t want any guests to see me here. Because I represented his broke, embarrassing past. He wanted me nowhere near his glittering new world.

Tears stung my eyes as I thought of that. Like a knife was twisting in my chest.

“Let me in or I’m starting to yell.” I choked.

The bodyguard frowned. ""Wait here.""

He finally called somebody. A few minutes later, he waved me in.

I wiped my eyes and struggled into the hall with my suitcase and boxes.

Instantly, I felt out of place.

Everything reeked of wealth here. Expensive perfume. Manicured nails. Not a hair out of place. It was everything you imagined about the upper-class and way more.

And me?

I was wearing a baggy T-shirt and jeans. My sneakers had holes.

""God, a homeless. She stinks."" A woman mutter as I walked by.

No it couldn’t be. I just showered this morning. My hair still smelled like strawberries and coconut.

But poverty had a scent, apparently.

""Mr. Carter is inside."" The guard took me to a closed door and warned, “Make it quick.”

“Thank you.”

The room inside looked like something out of a movie. Marble floors. White carpet. A chandelier that probably cost more than my apartment.

And there he was.

The man I used to love.

Adjusting his bowtie in front of a mirror.

Jace was still heartbreakingly handsome. No wonder Delilah fell for him.

When he turned and fixed his gorgeous blue eyes upon me, I still felt my heart race.

""Hey, Jace,"" I said quietly.

And immediately, I wanted to punch myself.

Hey, Jace?!

That’s the best I could do?

His face was ice cold.

""You shouldn't come, Aria.” he said with a frown. “Your ratty suitcase, your ripped jeans, your Vans. None of that belongs here.""

Well if you wanted to be brutal and vicious, that’s how it’s done.

""Don’t you think I deserve an explanation? You dumped me over a fucking email!"" I snapped.

He shrugged. ""Look around you. The wealthiest people in the world came for me today. This suit I’m wearing cost more than you can make in your entire life. What more explanation do you want?""

Wow.

I always knew he was a cold, calculating bastard.

I just didn’t realize how deep it ran.

""Maybe chasing Alpha’s sister got you here faster. But you know what? When she finds out how shallow and cold you are. You’ll lose it all.""

Anger flared across his face.

""I know how to love someone! I just won't waste that on a small-town girl like you.” he said freezingly, “Are we done here?""

“No.”

I took a deep breath and got into the real reason I came.

""You're marrying a rich girl. Fine. But why did you have to get me fired?""

Yeah. I used to work for this jerk.

From intern to full-time at Apex Corp, he was my supervisor.

Our office romance was a secret. And just days ago, I found out he was getting married with Apex CEO’s sister. And I was out of a job thanks to him.

""Right, your job.” The jerk shrugged, “You got your job all thanks to me. Now that I’m not around, maybe they finally saw how incompetent and stupid you are. Problem?""

Was he fucking kidding me?!

""I graduated top of my class. Made it through 7 rounds of interviews. My performance exceeded every quarterly target. I earned that job!"" I snapped.

“Come on, Aria. You really gonna be so naïve?”

He walked closer, smirking.

""You passed the interviews because I said so. Your sales? I contacted those customers for you. Without me, you'd be nothing but a pretty face.""

He seized my chin and looked me over with a disgusting look. I slapped his hand away.

""Give me my job back,” I hissed, my voice slightly trembling. “My dad’s debt. My grandma’s medical bills…I need the money. You of all people should know what it’s like to be poor. Don’t. Make. Me. Beg.""

I was throwing my pride at his feet.

But he just laughed.

""Well, how about I offer you a deal?"" he said as though he’d been waiting for this moment.

He brushed my hair back, fingers trailing down to my collarbone. I shivered in disgust.

""You and I. We never fuck. You were so clinging to that pathetic no-sex-before-marriage rule. Maybe it's time to grow up. Let me fuck you once and I’ll write you very handsome check. How does that sound?""

I widened my eyes in shock.

Then I slapped him. HARD.

“FUCKING HELL…What the hell are you doing?! I’m getting married in front of everyone in fucking 10 minutes!” He roared covering his swollen face.

""Fuck you, Jace!” I yelled, “You're a spineless freeloading puss! And hey—congrats on the wedding. Hope your junk is soft like a fucking spaghetti tonight!""

Then I stormed out dragging my suitcase and boxes, ignoring his angry curses behind me.

Hot tears poured down as I dashed across the hallway.

God this couldn’t be any worse.

I was prepared to drop all my self-esteem and begged with my life. Because I needed the job and money.

But I still let him get to me.

Now what do I do?

My salary barely covered my rent, my father’s debt and grandma’s bill. Now with my job gone, I already got kicked out by my landlord. I probably had to sleep in a park tonight.

So do I go back and let that jerk win? Let him humiliate me...No. I’d rather die than that…

""Hey, watch where you're going!"" someone yelled.

Too late.

I slammed right into the man in front of me.

He was tall. So tall I felt like I’d just walked into a brick wall.

His diamond cufflink was sharp like a blade. When we collided, it sliced clean through my thin T-shirt with a loud rip.

In one second, the front of my shirt was torn open, exposing my white lace bra.

“Ah!” I gasped and looked up.

This was the most handsome man I’d ever seen. His face was like a statue carved by a master artist. And his expression was so cold and distant.

When he looked down at me, I swear I was about to drown in those stormy gray eyes of his.

Suddenly, I recognized who he was.

This was Alpha of Redstone Pack. CEO of Apex Corporation.

Jace’s brother-in-law.

THE legendary. Grayson Hart.

“Aria Collins?”

His voice was sexy and velvety.

He lowered his head and his eyes dropped to the exposed part of my bra. Maybe it was just my imagination, but the color of his eyes seemed to darken as he stared.

Wherever his gaze landed, my skin started burning up.

But wait.

How did he know my name?

# Chapter 2 With Ex's Brother-in-law

Aria’s POV

Of course I recognized him. God, who didn’t?

I’d met him at the Apex gala. His face was on every finance magazine cover, and any time you turned on a TV, there he was—linked to the latest scandal with some actress or model.

But there was no way he’d know who I was.

“I-I…Hello, Alpha Grayson,” I stammered.

He turned his eyes away and said to a nearby guard, “Escort Ms. Collins out.”

“Yes, Alpha.”

The guards stepped in immediately, stretching out their arms like I was some kind of contaminant that might taint Grayson’s perfectly tailored suit.

“Wait a minute. You’re not going to say something about my shirt?” It’s torn beyond repair and was showing my breasts.

He paused. Just for a brief second. Then flicked something down at my feet.

I looked down. A blank check.

“I need a shirt that can cover my front. Not your hush money.” I gritted with humiliation.

But he didn’t even glance back and just walked away.

“God,” I muttered under my breath.

Can you believe these rich bastards?

They think they can buy everything with money.

People nearby were all staring, snickering under their breath. I tried to cover my chest and grab my things to escape, but it was hard to do all that with just two hands.

“Oh my god…Aria Collins?”

Three girls emerged from the whispering crowd. I took one look at them and sighed internally.

Great. Just when I thought today couldn’t get any worse.

“Hello. Layla. Sabrina. Brielle.” I said dryly.

I used to work in the same team with these girls back at Apex. We were all under Jace.

These girls adored Jace. They spent more time flirting with him by the coffee machine than actually working. Which left me doing most of their work.

After I got fired, and when news of my secret relationship with Jace got out, they decided I was public enemy number one.

“What are you even doing here, Aria? Trying to win back your ex at his wedding? That’s a new low even for you,” Layla snickered.

“I’m not here to win anyone back.” I tried to push past them.

But they blocked me.

“What happened to your shirt?” Brielle snickered. “Did you seriously walk in here with your bra out? Is this like some low-budget fashion statement?”

They burst into laughter together.

“You could be completely naked and Jace still wouldn’t give a damn,” Sabrina squeaked. “Because he’s marrying Lady Delilah. THE Delilah Hart! Redstone Pack’s sweetheart. And you…well you’re just a poor-ass small-town girl.”

I stopped in my track and gave them a cold glare, “Oh yeah? Well at least this smalltown girl actually dated Jace. And you all got nothing. Do you know how many times I had to listen to him complained about your screechy voices and cheesy perfume after we got home? Apparently he rather be with me than any of you.”

Their jaws dropped.

“Jace would never say that!” Brielle cried.

“And my perfume isn’t cheesy!” Sabrina screamed.

“Word for word,” I rolled my eyes. “Now move. Or I’m rolling this suitcase over your pretty little skirts.”

They looked like ruffled chickens, but they parted. I quickly shoved my dingy luggage ahead like a weapon and stormed out of the church.

Rich people were assholes.

Grayson, Jace, and their whole damn minions.

I struggled to get my suitcase down the steps, and once I hit the street, cold wind slapped me in the face.

It’s almost night. But I had no idea where to go.

I could crash in the hospital with my grandma, but she’d ask too many questions. Like why I hadn’t brought Jace around recently, or why I wasn’t staying at my apartment. I didn’t want her to know how bad things had gotten.

I thought about the park. Sleeping on a bench. But in a ripped T-shirt that exposed my whole front? Horrible idea.

So I texted my best friend, May, asking to stay at her place for a few days. She was my rock. If the whole world turned against me, at least I still had her.

She texted back right away inviting me to come over.

Dragging my suitcase across the street toward the bus stop, I told myself it was going to be okay. This horrible day was going to end.

Then I heard them.

“Hey, nice shirt!”

A group of street wolves were loitering near the stop.

I hugged myself tighter and curled into the bench, hoping they’d get bored and leave.

“C’mon baby, drop your hands. Let us see what you’re working with.”

Go away. Go away. Go away.

“You rip that shirt yourself? Damn that’s wild. I like that in a girl.” One of them moved closer, reaching for my shoulder.

“Fuck off!” I snapped, my voice shaking.

But it only fired them up.

“Oh, feisty. Shake those tits for me!”

They grabbed my wrists, yanked my arms down. My T-shirt gaped open completely, revealing my lace bra. The cold air made my skin pebble. They laughed even louder.

I struggled and screamed. My wolf growled in rage.

Shifting in the city was illegal…but right now, I didn’t have a second choice…

Just then. Blinding headlights. Followed by screeching tires.

A silver car skidded to a stop inches away.

The door flew open. A deep voice thundered:

“Get in.”

I was too shocked that I didn’t think twice and obeyed. The car peeled away the second I shut the door.

“My suitcase!” I cried.

“Someone will get it,” he said darkly. “Address.”

I told the driver May’s, my body still shaking. Then he pressed a button. A privacy screen slid up between the front and back seats, sealing us in the back.

That’s when he turned toward me and leaned in. Like a beast ready to pounce.

His scent hit me. It’s sharp pine mixed with cold metal.

My head started to get dizzy.

“Walking on the street in that shirt was a mistake,” he said darkly.

“It got like this because of you,” I mumbled.

He snorted.

Then there’s the sound of rustling fabric. A heavy jacket landed across my shoulders. It was still warm from his body and carried his scent.

I held my breath.

Wearing his coat almost felt like…he was wrapping himself around me.

“Alpha Grayson…do you know me?” I whispered.

My gut told me that he would never do this for a strange girl. But if he knew who I was, he must know that I was his sister’s husband’s ex. That didn’t explain why he would help.

“We’ve met,” he said simply.

I stared at him, searching those icy gray eyes. He was staring at me too, with those cold, hungry, possessive eyes. I felt like I was completely naked in front of him.

“Aria,” he warned, voice thick and husky.

But I couldn’t control myself.

I was leaning forward.

Shit. Why did my body become so weird?

My skin was on fire. My panties were wet. All I wanted was more of his scent. More of his heat.

The next second his lips crashed onto mine. Hard. Rough.

I gasped and opened my mouth for him. His tongue slipped in and explored every inch of my mouth, making me shiver. His hands pushed into my torn shirt and grabbed my breast. I couldn’t control my moan when he touched my naked skin.

This…This was crazy.

He was a stranger, and most importantly, my ex’s brother-in-law.

And I was making out with him at the back of his car.

The crazy part was I didn’t even want to stop.

He lifted me onto his lap like I weighed nothing. I straddled his thighs and yanked at his tie as he bit my collarbone.

Then, suddenly, the car stopped.

“Alpha, we’ve arrived,” the driver said behind the screen.

That’s when it all froze.

His lips paused at my neck. I was still squirming on his lap, flushed and throbbing. But he shoved me off.

“We can’t do this,” he said coldly.

# Chapter 3 You're Special To Him

Aria’s POV

“So you’re telling me this guy made out with you in the backseat of his car… and then just shoved you off like nothing happened?” May asked in shock.

20 minutes later, I was sitting at her place, wrapped in one of her oversized hoodies, a steaming mug of tea in my hands.

But I was still reeling from everything that had just happened.

“Yup,” I muttered. “Who knows what’s wrong with him.”

“What an asshole,” she huffed. “But honestly, this really isn’t like you. You dated that jerk Jace for 4 years and didn’t even sleep with him—which, by the way, was a brilliant choice—and now you're suddenly making out with a complete stranger in his car?”

I opened my mouth but had no idea what to say. Yeah, she had a point.

“I—I don’t know. Maybe it was the whole Jace-getting-married thing. Maybe I just snapped and wanted to screw around with someone hotter just to get back at him…Honestly, it was so stupid now that I think of it.”

She grinned and wiggled her brows. “So… he was hot huh?”

My cheeks flushed and my mind drifted back.

Those stormy gray eyes, his perfectly shaped lips on my neck, and those arms that could pick me up like I weighed nothing…Shit I need to stop.

“Yeah. VERY,” I whispered, hiding my red face behind the mug.

May burst out laughing. “Now we’re talking! That’s exactly what you need right now—a drop-dead gorgeous rebound to get that loser Jace out of your system. Screw your ‘no sex before marriage’ rule. Life is short.”

I gave her a weak smile.

Honestly, I didn’t need a rebound. I needed a job, money, and a place to live. Grayson Hart was like dessert when you can’t even afford dinner.

“So… do you even know who this guy was?” she asked.

I hesitated. Right at this moment, the doorbell rang.

She jumped up to get it and came back a few minutes later, hauling in my luggage, her face frozen in disbelief.

“OMG. You are not gonna believe what just showed up outside.”

“Umm… my luggage?” I joked.

“Two fucking muscular guys in black suits and guns! And a freaking stretch limo! They called me ‘ma’am’ and said they hope Miss Aria has a wonderful evening. Now, you—”

She leapt at me and shook me by the shoulders.

“—you tell me right now who the hell you hooked up with!”

I squealed and dropped into the couch with her, laughing and giggling breathlessly.

“Okay, okay—I’ll tell you. It was… Grayson Hart.”

I practically whispered his name.

Because honestly, I still couldn’t believe it either.

May froze, eyes wide as saucers. “Grayson—THE Grayson Hart?! As in our Alpha? The CEO of Apex?!”

“And Jace’s soon-to-be brother-in-law. Now you know how stupid I was earlier?”

She let out a full-on scream. Then she grabbed my hand, her face flushed with excitement. “Oh my God! Aria, do you know what this means? Alpha Grayson never even lends his jacket to his model girlfriends. He likes you. You’re special!”

“No,” I said firmly. “If I was special, he wouldn’t have thrown me off his lap when I tried to take off his shirt.”

“Maybe he had somewhere to be—”

“Don’t, May. Let’s be real. Guys like him don’t fall for girls like me.” I took another sip of tea, hiding the ache in my chest.

Hell even Jace thought I was beneath him.

What chance did I have with Grayson freaking Hart?

“Don’t be silly, Aria. You’re gorgeous. And smart and amazing and—WAIT! I just had the best idea ever.”

“What?”

“That arrogant jerk Jace thinks you’re just some small-town prude who wasn’t good enough for him right? But what if you ended up with Alpha Grayson? It’ll be easy to get him because he’s already obsessed. Oh, it would destroy Jace. That dickhead would never recover.”

OKAY.

I’d be lying if I said that exact scenario hadn’t crossed my mind when Grayson kissed me back.

What girl hasn’t daydreamed about dating the perfect guy and getting revenge in the most dramatic way possible?

But right now, I couldn’t afford to daydream. Reality was already breathing down my neck.

“Tempting. But right now I need a job and enough cash to keep Grandma in her hospital bed. Dating rich dudes isn’t exactly high on my to-do list.”

May looked at me with soft eyes. “So…any plans? I can try to hook you up with a job, but you know I just work at a coffee shop, and with your degree, you deserve so much more.”

I hugged her. “Thank you. Really. I’ll figure something out. Apex promised me severance when they fired me, so I’m going to HR tomorrow to get it sorted.”

If I could get that money, at least I’d be OK for the next round of Grandma’s medical bills.

—

The next morning, I showed up at Apex right on time.

But the second Brielle walked in with the HR manager, I had a bad feeling.

“What’s she doing here?” I asked coldly.

“I’ll explain in a minute,” HR replied with a polite, rehearsed smile as she sat across from me. “So Ms. Collins, I understand you’re here to discuss severance?”

“Yes. So let’s not waste time. Just give me the check and I’ll be out of here.”

“Unfortunately, severance only applies when the company terminates a contract without cause. In your case… it appears you were let go due to misconduct.”

Misconduct?

What the freaking hell.

“Jace made a snap decision and booted me. What misconduct are you talking about?”

“But that’s not what Mr. Carter said. He provided evidence that you made a costly error on a sales quote—omitting a few zeroes, to be exact. Cost the company millions. Here’s the email record.”

She handed me a printed sheet.

I swore I had never sent this email in my life. But there it was—my name in the sender field.

No freaking way.

Jace forged this.

“And Mr. Carter reported that you had a difficult attitude toward your coworkers. Quote: ‘impatient and arrogant.’ Brielle’s here to verify that.”

Brielle twirled her hair and smiled smugly. “Yeah. Aria was a horrible team player.”

I stood so fast my chair screeched. “The only thing I didn’t ‘teamplayed’ with you was flirt with the boss in the breakroom!”

“Liar!” she yelled. “And I asked Jace. He never said my voice was screechy!”

Oh my God. I couldn’t believe how stupid she was.

“Sit down, Miss Collins,” HR warned. “As of now, not only are you not getting severance, but we’re also considering legal action to recover the losses. If you understand the situation here, sign this acknowledgement—”

“Does Alpha Grayson know about this?” I asked.

Both of them froze. After a long pause, HR finally found her voice. “What does Alpha Grayson have to do with any of this?”

“He owns Apex, doesn’t he? Does he know his team is abusing their power and firing hardworking employees illegally?”

HR frowned. Brielle let out a loud snort. “Please. Don’t act like you know Alpha Grayson.”

“What if I do? What if I go to him and then it’s you who gets fired?”

She laughed in my face. “Oh, you mean you know him on TV?”

“Let’s find out.”

I shoved my chair back and stormed out, heading straight for the CEO’s private elevator at the end of the hall. HR scrambled after me, shouting my name.

I was too furious to care how this ended. All I wanted now was to blow the whole damn place up.

Two guards stood by the elevator.

“I need to see Alpha Grayson,” I told them.

“Appointment?”

“No, but I swear he knows me. Just tell him it’s Aria—from yesterday. He’ll remember.”

“You aren’t the first girl here saying that,” one of them mocked.

“Come on, Miss Collins,” HR snapped, trying to drag me back. “This is getting crazy. Go back, sign the paper. Take responsibility for your own mistake.”

“I didn’t send that email. It was Jace—he’s framing me! I will report all of you.”

“Alpha Grayson doesn’t have time for your report, or your visit, or any of your little drama!”

“I believe no one but me has the right to decide that,” a cold voice said behind us.

# Chapter 4 Take Me, Please

Aria’s POV

A large hand grabbed my arm and pulled me away from HR’s grip.

I looked up and my heart almost stopped.

Even I couldn’t believe he just showed up here. It felt like a dream.

“A-Alpha Grayson,” HR stammered, her face frozen with shock and fear.

“I don’t need employees who think they can make decisions for their boss,” he said freezingly while wrapping his arm around my waist. “If I see something like this again, you’re fired.”

“Y-yes, Alpha. I’m terribly sorry…”

HR’s expression was priceless, but I was in no mood to enjoy it. His icy pine scent consumed me again, making my body weak and hot. My wolf let out a soft purr, urging me to lean into him. But before I could even move, he let go.

A pang of disappointment hit me in the chest.

“Come,” he said shortly, striding toward the private elevator.

I shot HR and the stunned security guards a smug look, then hurried after him.

He swiped his card and the elevator doors closed. We started going up to the 58th floor.

It was dead silent. My heart was beating so wildly that I was afraid he’d hear it. I snuck a glance at him—he just stared straight ahead, emotionless, keeping a distance, like he wanted to be anywhere but here.

Unease twisted my stomach.

“So, um… what brings you here today?” I broke the silence.

He sighed softly. “I owe this company.”

“Oh, Oh…Right.”

I wanted to punch myself in the face.

The awkward silence lingered until the elevator dinged open. The 58th floor was a wide-open space with no cubicles or dividers—just massive floor-to-ceiling windows and a sweeping view of the entire city.

“Wow,” I whispered under my breath. Grayson was already walking ahead.

I jogged to catch up as he led me into an office at the far end of the floor. A stunning female assistant closed the door behind us, and once again, it was just the two of us. My heart rocketed back into my throat.

He casually unbuttoned his jacket. It was amazing how he made even that look sexy.

“So you insisted on seeing me?” he asked.

He didn’t ask me to sit. He didn’t even move closer. That distance stung a little.

“I worked here till a week ago when I found out I was let go for no reason…” I quickly told him the story of how I was fired. “This is clearly illegal in so many ways… can you help me get my job back?”

“Unfortunately, no,” he replied, barely hesitating.

My heart dropped like a stone. “Why not?”

“I’ll have the hiring department look into whether your termination followed proper protocol. But this isn’t something a CEO handles directly. Anything else?”

The hiring department?

That could take weeks—and I didn’t have weeks.

“No… you don’t get it,” I stepped forward, my voice trembling. “My grandma’s in the hospital. Her bills are getting insane every month. And I’m already deep in debt… If I can’t make money, I don’t even know— I really, REALLY need this job.”

I knew we came from two different worlds, but laying out the most desperate parts of my life in front of him still made me feel horribly exposed. I just hoped—begged—that he’d understand.

But he didn’t.

His gray eyes stayed emotionless.

“I’m sorry, Miss Collins,” he said quietly.

Tears rushed into my eyes. I couldn’t even breathe.

All I could think about were the bills, the debt, the mountain of shit waiting for me the second I left this building.

“If there’s nothing else, my assistant will show you out.” he said, reaching for the intercom.

I rushed forward and pressed my hand down on his before he could call anyone in.

His whole body stiffened—but he didn’t pull away. He just stared down at me. I stepped in closer, tilting my head up. His gray eyes darkened like a storm brewing in the distance.

His pine scent wrapped around me again, thick and intoxicating. As werewolves, our scent only spikes during a fight or sexual arousal. It was damn obvious which case this was.

“You clearly feel something for me,” I whispered.

He said nothing. I placed my hand on his chest and felt his heartbeat. It was racing as well. His breathing had also turned shallow.

“What are you doing, Miss Collins?” he asked tightly. “Trying to seduce your way into a job?”

“You can do whatever you want,” I locked eyes with him. “I won’t stop you.”

His Adam’s apple bobbed. God, I wanted to lick it.

And… well, I did.

I leaned up and pressed my lips to it. He let out a growl.

The next second, I was pinned on his desk. He stood between my spread legs, one hand by my head. I whimpered, clamping my thighs together—the heat between them was almost unbearable. Just like in the backseat of his car.

His hand slid from the desk to my throat. It was so big, he could probably snap my neck if he wanted.

“You shouldn’t keep tempting me, Miss Collins.”

His body was pressed against my thighs—I definitely felt the effect I was having on him.

“Why?” I whispered, licking my lips. “Because your self-control isn’t as strong as you thought?”

“Because I don’t fuck virgins.”

What the actual hell???

The next second, he had pulled away. I scrambled off the desk, face red, eyes wide.

“What did you just say?!” I snapped. “Why—How the hell do you even know—?”

“I know who you are. And I know about your relationship with my sister’s husband.”

And just like that, everything clicked.

It was Jace.

That bastard didn’t just dump me—he ran his mouth about my virginity to everyone, including Grayson.

Humiliation crashed over me like a wave.

“Jace is a fucking asshole,” I snapped shakily.

Grayson shrugged. “Obviously. But Brielle likes him. And he’s family now. I’m sorry but I just can’t get involved in this.”

I climbed off his desk with my whole body red and shaking.

He didn’t want me. And he was taking his sister and Jace’s side.

I was so damn stupid to think that one kiss in the car actually meant anything. But this was Grayson Hart for Christ’s sake. He could have anyone he wanted.

“I’m sure you’re a very capable employee, Miss Collins. But seducing me won’t help your career. I wish you all the best.”

He finally pressed the intercom button. His assistant appeared at the door, waiting for me to leave.

“Bye,” I whispered without even look back. I didn’t want him to notice my falling tears.

I walked out of that office, numb, and rode the elevator down like a ghost. My mind was a storm of bills, debt, and Grayson’s ice-cold stare. Now I desperately needed a new job.

“Miss Collins!”

I turned and saw his assistant come rushing out again, holding an envelope.

“Alpha Grayson asked me to give you this,” she said, handing it over.

“What is it?” Why didn’t he give it to me earlier?

“He didn’t say. Maybe you’ll know once you open it.”

She gave me a mysterious smile and walked away.

I opened the envelope. A blank check slid out first—I held my breath in shock.

Then I found a crumpled note. His handwriting, rushed and messy.

Haven’t repaid you for the shirt. Hope everything works out for you Aria. Stay strong. —Grayson

# Chapter 5 Getting My Attention

Aria’s POV

“That check clearly means something,” May insisted.

“Come on. We’re not doing this again,” I sighed.

“If he’s not into you, then why did he give you that check? He probably saw you crying and couldn’t stand it. You should definitely go back and see him again.”

“Nope,” I shut it down immediately. “I had one perfect, fairytale encounter with a rich bachelor. That’s enough. I’m not about to go back there and humiliate myself all over again.”

“But—”

“Hey, you two!” our manager yelled from the other end of the aisle. “Less talking, more working!”

We rolled our eyes at each other and got back to inventory.

May had helped me land this supermarket job.

It was part of a chain under a big corporation, so the pay and benefits weren’t bad. May still thought it was beneath someone with my degree, but honestly, I was just grateful to be employed.

Once we finished our section, the manager wandered off to shout at someone else, and May scooted back over to me.

“Just imagine it,” she grinned. “You could write a couple million on that blank check and…BOOM! Instant rich girl life.”

“I’m not gonna do that.”

“Sure you won’t. You’re too nice,” she muttered, half-admiring, half-scolding. “So? What are you gonna write?”

I hesitated.

At first, I actually considered writing the price of a shirt. 19.99 that was. Because apparently, my dignity still thinks it matters.

But let’s be real, Grayson wasn’t just paying me back for a ripped tee, or he would’ve simply handed his assistant a $20 bill.

Maybe… he felt bad I lost my job too.

“I’m going to write the amount I should’ve gotten in severance,” I admitted eventually.

May's eyes bulged. “That’s it?!”

“I know it’s not much, but it’s what I actually deserve. And it’ll help me cover 2 months of bills.”

May sighed and looked at me like I was the biggest idiot alive. But my mind was made up.

I just wanted to walk away from the mess as quickly as possible. I still wanted to rip Jace’s smug face off, but the best revenge right now was surviving.

6 hours later, we finally finished our shift, exhausted and aching.

Everyone else got to clock out, but not me. I’d volunteered for night shift and closing duties.

The staffs left one by one, yawning, including May. Finally I was alone in this big market.

Now here’s the big secret—

I actually lived here now.

Nobody knew this, not even May.

She thought I’d found a new apartment and moved out, but I just couldn’t keep bothering her anymore. Her roommates were getting irritated with me hogging the living room and utilities.

And renting my own place seemed way out of budget now.

So I stayed in this supermarket instead.

I closed up the store at night and opened it early in the morning. For the 5 or 6 hours in between, I made a bed out of my coat and slept on the floor near the refrigerated section.

Now don’t ask me why I can’t sleep in the staff’s break room. That room was too hot without AC. At least it was cool by the freezer.

Tonight I was extra exhausted. The manager made us girls haul too many heavy crates around. I fell asleep on the floor in seconds.

It felt like I’d only been asleep for 5 minutes. My alarm hadn’t even gone off yet.

And I was jolted awake by someone screaming:

“—OH MY GOD! What the hell are you doing?!”

I shot upright, still half-asleep.

And I froze.

In front of me stood an entire group of people. Including the manager and several guys in suits. They were all staring at me wide eyes.

And I was only in a tank top and shorts. Half naked.

OH GOD.

What the hell…Is it morning already?!

Why didn’t I hear my alarm?

I scrambled to pull my clothes over my body, my hands shaking.

The stares didn’t stop. They got more invasive.

“Aria Collins! What the fuck are you doing?!” the manager stormed over and roared. “Napping half-naked in my fucking store?! Are you a fucking sex perv?!”

My face went beet red, “No! I—I was just staying here temporarily—”

“Temporarily?!” he yelled, eyes bulging. “I hired an employee, not a fucking squatter! How much water and electricity have you used free?! Have you been stealing food too?!”

“No I swear! I shut everything off when I’m done, I don’t use the water unless I have to…And I paid for everything I’ve eaten!”

Tears blurred my vision as I tried to explain, but he wasn’t listening. His spit actually hit my cheek as he snarled.

“Of all days—you had to pick the day corporate shows up to camp out in my perfect store. You filthy, disgusting little—”

“Aria Collins?”

A new voice called my name. It came from one of those suited men.

I looked up. And my heart dropped.

God I knew this guy. I think his name is Jonathan. A former coworker of mine from Apex.

“Holy shit, it is you,” he grinned in surprise, raising his brows. “Almost didn’t recognize you at first.”

“You… what are you doing here?” I stammered.

“Apex owns this supermarket chain. We’re doing site inspections today,” he said with a smirk, his eyes trailing down to my bare legs. “Man! Most people hit rock bottom after getting fired from Apex, but you fall faster than anyone.”

“I’m working. Making a decent living,” I said in shaky voice. “There’s no shame with that.”

“Oh really?” he sneered. “Does your job include lying around half-naked on the floor? What is this, a new hooker gimmick?”

The suits burst out laughing. My furious tears were on the verge of falling.

“I’m so sorry, sir. I’ll fire her right away.” The manager groaned.

“Hold up,” Jonathan drawled with a smirk. “This chick got fired from Apex for messing up a seven-figure deal. You might wanna check your inventory. She could be stealing.”

I was furious. “You know that’s a lie! Jace made it all up. I never made a single mistake at work—”

“Oh please,” he cut me off. “Everyone in the industry knows how you fucked up. Jace was so embarrassed that he had to apologize to all the customers for you.”

The manager grabbed my wrist. “Then you’re definitely stealing from this market as well. That’s it. You are going to jail. When I figure out what you’ve taken, you must pay back everything!”

My heart pounded in my chest.

I didn’t doubt for a second that the manager would come up with something that I didn’t steal, just like how Jace framed me before. It wasn’t hard for guys like them.

But I couldn’t go to jail.

My grandma had no one to count on but me. I can’t leave her.

I knew what I had to do.

The wolf in me surfaced up the next second. I snarled at the manager, yanked my arm free, and ran.

“Stop her!” someone shouted behind me.

I had no idea where I was going. I just fucking ran. Desperate and horrified.

At the door, I slammed right into someone coming in.

“Get away from Alpha!” a bodyguard barked.

I staggered back in panic. But a large hand caught my wrist, steadying me.

“Aria?”

I looked up, still shaking involuntarily.

God, it’s indeed him! I couldn’t believe he’s here.

There’s a tight furrow between Grayson’s brows as he checked me up. Then he quickly unbuttoned his coat and wrapped me in, covering my half-naked body.

“It’s OK.” his voice was deep with clear hint of rage.

I clutched his shirt, gasping for air.

But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t seem to breathe at all. Tears streamed down my cheeks.

“She’s having a panic attack,” a woman said nearby. “Alpha, if I may—”

I silently prayed him not to hand me over. And he didn’t.

“It’s fine, Nova. She stays with me,” he refused. “Aria. Breathe.”

Panicked footsteps echoed behind us. Jonathan’s voice rang out, stunned:

“Alpha Grayson! W-What’s going on here?!”

“Nova,” Grayson said in a cold, dangerous voice, “Stay here. Don’t let anyone leave.”

“Yes, Alpha.”

He scooped me up like I weighed nothing, one arm under my legs, the other around my back. I instinctively wrapped my arms around his neck.

Then he carried me through the astonished crowd, into the store, and found a private room.

“You’re safe here,” he said after he shut the door.

That’s when I broke down. Crying out loud.

Fear, shame, panic—everything spilled out in a messy, helpless flood.

I clutched his wrist like it was the only thing keeping me from falling apart. He didn’t pull away.

I cried for 10 minutes straight He waited for my sobs to quiet down.

“Th-thank you…I’m better now.” I sniffled eventually.

He wiped a tear from my cheek with his thumb. I shivered at the way he touched my skin.

“You are always a mess when I find you,” he said. “Why is that?”

“I don’t know…Fate?” I choked.

He let out a dark chuckle. “This is not good.”

“W-Why?” I didn’t mean to be miserable all the time.

His voice was low, rough, and strained.

“Because it’s getting harder and harder for me to leave you like this,” he said.",1,1766038420.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

\>>>>

A heavy sigh echoed in the almost empty room. It was a meager abode, as one would expect in the bowels of a spaceborn warship. It was meant to be a single person’s quarters, and was thusly occupied. Joints creaked, and the chair groaned under the weight of man and armor. A single, out-of-regulation cigar smoldered to the side as the lone figure reached for the record button.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We should have known they would come, over three decades of sporadic skirmishes, countless failed negotiations, and thousands of lives lost, proved the grim prophecy of what was to come. The Shreeks, at least that’s what we called them, chose our most sacred holiday season to loose their hordes upon us. It went by many names; Some just called it the Winter Holidays, others celebrated it as Yuletide, others Hanukkah, and yet others, Christmas. Now, Humanity remembers it by yet another name, The Red Noel.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My name, my name was Archie Beckman… and I was there, on Celest 3; one of humanity's furthest colonies, on the night that name, and the shaggy-haired, lanky, innocent kid… died. I was home for the holidays, freshly back from Terra, and a newly minted graduate of architectural engineering. I missed the first snowfalls by mere weeks, and by the time my transport made orbit, the towering ranges of the “New Alps” were already thick with fresh powder, and the streets of my hometown of NeoHallstatt had acquired their customary sprinkling of white. I remember my freezing knuckles almost reaching the door before it was flung open. “Archy!! You made it!!” Mamma Beckman, Ma to most everyone, practically dragged me through the threshold of their home. I smiled through the not-quite-crushing embrace, “Hi Ma, \*OOOF\* I made it. I was able to catch a Redeye out of LAX, routed through Luna station.”

Ma Beckman waved away my explanation, taking my hand to forcefully drag me futher into the abode “Later, Later. I want you to meet someone!”. The statement drew an unwilling groan from my chest, “Ma! Not again, I just got home!” another dismissive wave slumped my shoulders. Ma Beckman always fancied herself a matchmaker, constantly trying to pair off her only son with a suitable match to continue on the Bechman name. We finally reached the Den, and I stopped cold. “Archy, I want you to meet Lacy, She’s freshly home from Terra as well!” I groaned internally, not having the heart to tell my mother that she had failed, once again. “Nice to meet you, Ms?”

“Jorrins” Lacy played her part well, “Lacy Jorrins, and you must be this Archibald Beckman I keep hearing about.” I shook my head with a playful smile, “Archibald is my father, just call me Archie. Otherwise, guilty as charged.” I glanced over my shoulder to see my mother positively beam with joy before turning to leave them Lacy and I to ‘get to know each other’. Unfortunately, we did… know each other. Lacy and I had dated briefly in my junior year of academy. It was a hot, fast flame that burned out too quickly. We were still close friends, but Lacy was seeing someone on Terra, and I was not interested in any relationships at all. I leaned in, “Sorry about all this, my mother can be….” Lacy snorted a giggle, “It’s fine, you did warn me about her. I hope you don’t mind me crashing dinner, my parents are away on a ski trip and won't be back until the 23^(rd).”

“I’m game if you are, at least I don’t have to pretend to entertain a complete stranger this time.” I whispered before offering my elbow. “I’ll let my mom down easy tomorrow, Shall we?” Lacy took my arm, and the two of us turned toward the dining room. We made it three steps.

The heat still burns my memory, a massive explosion from the street, bursting its way through the panoramic dining room window, blowing me back through the door connecting it and the den. Everything went white with the flash, then black when my head slammed into the hardwood floor behind me, barely missing the coffee table’s edge. Consciousness clawed at me, and I rolled over with a groan. “Ma!  Pa!” my ears rang. I knew I was speaking, but I could not hear my own voice. My vision cleared, and I immediately wished for blindness once more. The exterior wall to the dining room was gone, the bottom half of Pa’s body lay where he stood, the upper half skewered to the wall next to the doorway I was blown from. Ma was gone. She had been standing directly in front of the window during the blast, and I can still see the blood stained shoes just sitting there as if she were still standing in that self same spot. *Lacy*

My mind caught up, and I spun towards my next horror. Lacy had not missed the coffee table, her motionless body punctuated by her head, tilted unnaturally from the impact, her blank stare boring into me. I knelt long enough to check her pulse before closing her eyes. More explosions rocked the house, drawing me from my grief-fueled stupor in time to hear something else… an unnaturally piercing high-pitched wail, one I only ever believed I would hear in horribly directed cautionary films for elementary school students. My blood ran ice cold, and my body refused to move *Shreeks.* More nightmarish calls followed, soon followed by the equally terrifying screams from human lungs. It was those screams that broke me from my stillness, not in anger, not in vengeance… but in fear.

I bolted from my ruined ancestral home, running for the only safety I believed I could attain, the spaceport. I needed to get off this world. Celest 3 was on the wrong side of Terran space to have ever seen a Shreeker incursion, and she was equally undefended. The spaceport was the only place my mind allowed me to rush too. My lungs burned with the frigid air, and my legs soon followed. The Space port was over 100 miles from me, but rational was no longer something I was capable of. I rounded a corner and came face to face with my first Shreeks.

I say Shreeks because that is what they were. Eight feet tall, but relatively frail compared to human anatomy, their four long, spindly reverse-jointed legs, covered in silky white fur allowed them great speed, and their blood contains chemicals that made them incredibly resistant to the cold, but at the price of resilience. Their blood flowed a blackish purple, but dried a bright red as those antifreezing chemicals evaporated from the fluid. Their species had compensated for this over the eons. A breeding pair could produce over a thousand of their kind in a standard year, expecting less than 5 percent to survive to adulthood. This strategy proved balanced in their ancient times, but overpopulation combined with evolution merged into a perfect storm once their race reached for the stars. Thus, the Hordes were created. The first Horde encountered Humanity roughly 50 years ago, on a faraway jungle world of New Amazonia. That conflict lasted a full decade before Humanity withdrew from the planet before dropping antimatter ordinance upon its surface and launched more antimatter weapons into the Horde fleet. It was at this moment in time, the Shreeks first reached out.

Having the power to erase a planet had proven worthy of pausing their great hunt. In their twisted logic, pissing off a space-faring race that could eradicate entire food sources was… not to be rushed into. Whether this was another skirmish or something more, I had no idea, but none of that mattered. In front of me were eight of the hideous creatures. The first, a crest of black on its head, hissed its challenge, saliva spraying to the ground in front of me. The ground instantly sizzled, and I was reminded just why the Shreeks were still dangerous to humans. Their saliva was made predominantly of a compound that, while safe for them, rivaled Humanity’s strongest corrosives. Being bitten on an arm was certain amputation. If that saliva reached the bloodstream, the victim was promised an excruciating death.

I froze a second time, but this time only for a moment before turning to run. I made it two steps before running straight into my neighbor. His name was Franz, and to my horror, he wore a fierce smile on his face, “Get clear, boy! We’ve Bestien to kill!” With that, he charged the beasts with his bare hands. He was not alone. 3 other men followed, and I felt myself drawn to watch. Franz was the first to reach the closest Shreek, grabbing one of its legs before twisting violently. The appendage shattered at the joint, and Franz spun the improvised weapon in his hands before driving it into the torso of a second Shreek. Moment’s later, the other men arrived. Two more Skreeks fell, dismembered by enraged hands, but the momentum was not to be. Fifteen more Shreeks emerged from the surrounding rubble, their leader releasing a vile black stream of acid mixed with saliva. I watched Franz’s body melt in front of me before the other men were jumped. Their bodies were pierced by the long, wicked fangs of the reinforcements.

I fell to the ground, scrambling backward until my back was against some rubble, my hands grabbing at anything I might have a prayer of using until my fingers found a jagged piece of concrete. Scrambling to my feet, I hurled my only weapon. To my surprise, I hit the leading Shreek in the head, and it crumpled, a bleeding hole through its forehead. The others paused briefly before shrieking their challenge. They charged, and I picked up another chunk of rubble. Tears flowed, and my hands shook, but I hurled the second rock, determined to take at least one more with me. I watched the concrete impact, but this time the Shreek exploded less than 15 yards from me. The blast covered me in thick purple ooze, throwing me from my feet. My head bounced off the pavement, and my mind began to swim. More explosions shredded through my psyche, followed first by the shrieks of these monsters, then by loud yet absurdly calm human voices.  “Clean’em up! I want this sector secured in 5! We’ve evac ships inbound!!” a deep base voice bellowed, giving my mind something to concentrate on. “Get the Civi’s back to the drop zone!!” A massive human hand, encased in a thick leather glove appeared in my vision, “Are you bit, son?” that same voice asked. I pawed at my vision, wiping the alien gore from my eyes, and taking the hand.

“I don’t think so, but… Pa… Ma.. They’re..” My voice failed me, and I stared at the mountain of a man next to me. In truth, I was nearly as tall as he, if still little more than a lanky twig in comparison. His long shaggy hair bore the resemblance of salt and pepper, if that salt and pepper were splattered in long-dried, bright red alien blood. He wore a long whiting beard, again stained in red, with the ensemble framing piercing eyes, and a pronounced nose that bore a long healed scar that stretched from his forehead to where it disappeared into his beard. He wore a heavily armored vest, ammunition pouches wrapped ‘round his midriff to give him a deceptively portly appearance, and a thick, hooded white winter coat that was now stained bright red from recent events. “They’re gone, son. We are tasked with getting the survivor from the planet.” The words nearly broke me, searing my soul with agony that slowly morphed into a blinding rage. The man reached for my shoulder, “Let’s get you out of here so…” “NO!” My voice cracked, but it also held. My tears dried, replaced with a fury that raised the eyebrow of my savior, “I want them dead… all of them… DEAD…”

“I see…” Something flashed across his features, a memory perhaps, or perhaps recognition. “Stay close, we will talk, if you live.” He spun on his heels to meet another man, also drenched in red, but wearing green fatigues, “The shuttles have touched down, The civi’s will be out in five, Who’s this,” The Towering bearded man in red looked down at me, “We will see.” He turned to another soldier to his left, “FRANK! Get the boys! Let's move!! Icarus in 1 hour!!” He turned back to me, “Survive, boy; try to keep up.”

With that, we were off. We made it two blocks, following the screams of the dead and dying. The man in red drew a cut-down shotgun from beneath his overcoat, dropping a pair of fresh shells into it before returning it to its oversized holster. On the opposite side of his body, he produced an enormous nickel-plated revolver that he reloaded from what I later learned were Moon clips in his ammunition pouches. He finished, never breaking stride, as we rounded the corner to face no less than 30 Shreeks. Two of the monsters wore strange packs on their back. These instantly turned to face us, and a bright yellow beam lanced out from the first one. The particle beam slammed into the chest of the soldier to my left, and he pinwheeled to the ground in the impact, “Officer class!!” the man in red bellowed, “Cut them down!” The air around me hammered my ears with the eruption of gunfire, but I dove for the fallen soldier's weapon. I had seen its kind in propaganda videos showcasing Humanity’s might, but I had no idea how to use it other than remembering where the trigger was. It didn’t matter, my anger half blinded me as I grabbed hold of the gun. I was heavy, but I lifted it to my shoulder anyway, pointing the barrel towards the center of the mass of Shreeks and pulled the trigger.  The recoil threatened to break my shoulder, driving me a full step back before I could level the weapon at my enemy once more. I don’t remember how many times I fired, or if I hit anything at all…but the gun clicked empty and I realized it was over. 30 Shreeks lay dead at our feet, and I felt a hand land on the barrel of my weapon, “Mind if I have this back?” I spun wide-eyed to see the man I watched die, standing beside me. His expression was stern, if slightly flickering with amusement, “At least you didn’t freeze.” Was all he said, nodding to the man in red before taking the weapon and leaving at a jog to search for surviving Shreek.       

The next hour followed a familiar pattern, and I found myself following the group through various parts of my home-town, but we found fewer and fewer survivors. Instead a never-ending horde of Shreek patrols seemed to replace the small pockets of human resistance. We ended up in the town square. The water fountain was long demolished in the nightmare that was this night. “Pull security!! Our Jumper arrives in 2 minutes!!” The man in red bellowed, swinging his revolver toward a group of charging Shreek. Now familiar booms echoed, his bullets ripping through multiple monsters before expending their energy, but this was different. The Shreeks kept coming, stepping over their fallen in waves… There must have been hundreds of them, and the Man in red drew his shotgun with his other hand, handing it to me along with a cloth satchel. “load like this,” he ordered, thumbing a lever that broke the weapon in half, exposing the shells inside, “keep shooting.” My hand throbbed after the first two shots, but I did as told, the searing pain fueled rage not allowing me to fear. All I cared about was dead Shreeks, and I was getting to kill them. In that moment, I truly did not care if I survived.

Two minutes felt like an eternity. I didn’t bother aiming, instead choosing to fire blast after blast into large clumps of Shreek foot-soldiers. Still, they advanced. A thirty-yard perimeter turned into twenty yards, and then into ten. We were being squeezed, more officer-class Shreeks appearing to pour their fire into our ranks. I felt the heat of one such beam sear the hair from the left side of my face, leaving that eye half blind in the process. We were dead, we all knew it; or so I thought. I was reaching for the last 2 shells in the pouch when I heard what I could only describe as the universe ripping in half, and several thousand explosive impacts stitched their way on either side of our position. A slower series of deafening staccato reports heralded more explosions about our position, and I looked up to see a massive, winged beast of iron and fury. It was a combat jumper, its nose cannon glowing from the heat hatred still being dispensed in bright flashes of high explosive impact. The arrival of the jumper turned the tide, driving the horde back far enough for the craft to land. I felt a hand on the back of my neck, firmly driving me under the wings and into the cargo compartment aft of the cockpit. Each man fired off a final salvo before following, and the man in red was the last aboard, emptying his revolver into the regathering horde from the door, even as the jumper began lifting off for its departure.

He closed the door, and I heard the telltale seal of an airlock. He didn’t bother reloading his gun, holstering it under his crimson attire. His eyes appraised me, noticing the shotgun still in my hand, fresh shells still in the other. The silence felt eternal, but he sat down across from me, “Well, boy, my name is Major Kristoff Nicolas. Welcome to the 25^(th). Let’s start with your name, shall we?”

It has been 40 years since that night, yet I still remember it as if it was yesterday. That day, the boy I was died. Today I will be present for the final assault, the strike that will ensure the future that I was never given. Today we eradicate the threat that took everything from me, yet gave me a purpose I never expected…

The doorbell rang, and the lone figure ended the recording. “Come!” The gravelly voice answered. A young naval ensign, barely old enough to shave, appeared from behind the opening door, “Uh,” he stuttered, noticing the half-glazed left eye and burn scarring still prominent on that side of the occupant’s face. “… I…Commander Clause Bechman? It is time, the Fleet has secured the last of the Shreek defenses, we are in orbit above their homeworld.”

Clause Bechman stood slowly to his full height. Gone was the lanky, skittish, terrified boy, gone was the architect. Decades of constant combat had prematurely aged him, and a neatly kept, short salt and pepper beard combined with grey hair betrayed the strain of combat and command. “Very good. Thank you, Ensign. Tell the admiral, I will be there presently.” The Ensign saluted and withdrew. Clause found himself reaching for a familiar coat, now permanently bright red instead of white. It was a final gift from the man who Clause owed his very existence, given in the final moments of a nameless hellhole some seven years past. Clause caressed the feathered hood’s edge, “Well, Major. We made it.” That was all he said before donning the overcoat and turning towards the door.",1,1766038338.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I’ve been working overnights for about two years I believe, Ian’s I never liked it. The only good thing about working overnights that I can think of is the extra pay and that my curre job is more quiet at night.

My last job was a complete mess overnights and quiet during the day, so working there during the day is what everyone on my shift wanted except you didn’t get the extra pay ofc 😒

Night shifts are catching up to me, there are times where I feel so tired, that just waking up in the middle of the night even on my days off makes me feel like I just might not make it another day, literally. Sometimes I’m so tired that I want to cry, I even had moments where I felt depressed.  Now trying my best to study for school, at least I while it’s slow on my job but even that’s a struggle especially once I get home from work.

I have a pet too that try my best to show affection towards and a boyfriend and sometimes i worry that I may burn out and crash on the both of them. My memory, I’m convinced is getting worse, I’m also almost constantly having to reschedule doctors and other appointments that I need to get to whenever I’m free from work bc I’m either too tired to make it to them or i forget that I schedule anything.😦

I’m convinced that my work shift is slowly taking over my body and I’m hoping that sooner than later I can work a different shift, I suggest that anyone out there that’s feeling the way that I do, escapes this craziness.

**12/21**

	I remember the morning really well. My mom and dad had just been told about their jobs going fully remote due to the pandemic. To my delight, they finally had time to make me breakfast in the mornings that wasn’t just cereal. I don't remember what I had that morning but I do remember there was crunchy bacon; my favorite food in the world. After breakfast was finished, I helped clean up and then asked my mom if she would play with me. She let out an audible sigh, “Maybe in a few minutes. I need to finish sweeping the floors.”  
	“Ok, Mom! I'll be in my room.” 

As I went up the stairs, I looked out the front window to look at the valley of snow. I was itching to play in it, and as I looked out, I saw what appeared to be a glistening, tall, and lanky Santa statue on the front lawn, staring directly inside and at me. I giggled and yelled to my pa, who was still sitting at the dining room table. “Hey, Pa… Santa's on the front lawn.” I said as I skillfully slid into the kitchen. He lowered his newspaper and looked at me with a perplexed face.   
	“What do you mean - ‘Santa’?” he said with a pause.  
	“Santa’s outside, and he's looking straight into the house from out on the front lawn.”

	My dad got up and started to walk towards the front door in his robe. He opened the front door to see… A freshly powdered lawn of white with no Santa to be seen. He turned and looked at me and said, “I don't see any Santa here.”  
	“I swear, I saw Santa!” I said with skepticism.

“Well, maybe it was a trick of light,” he said while closing the door, “Anyways, why don't you go up and get dressed.” 

	Me and my mom played for most of the afternoon in my room and in the crawl space going between rooms for tag. It was a quirky feature with our house, something my great-grandfather built way back in the 40’s. My great-grandfather was scared of intruders, so he built the house to have a large crawl space under and through the house. It connected many rooms in the house via a small 3’ by 3’ tunnel of plasterboards and wood. I was told that he made this so he could escape if the house was broken into. One day my mom showed them to me as a way to climb around the house but forbade me to enter them without supervision from her. Even still, I rarely went in them, as fun as they were, they were scary and full of  creepy crawlies.

	I played the day away with my mom and dad. I used up every inch of snow on the lawn and the neighboring sled hill in my fun. That night as I went inside, knocking off my boots to get the snow off, I looked back out at the tree line and saw a red glint from the moonlight from beyond the trees. It was dim but noticeable in the swath of snow. I told my pa, but again, he looked and saw nothing. He told me jokingly “We might have to go get your eyes checked little miss”. 

“But dad! I know what I saw! It was out in the trees.” I said with confidence. 

“Alright, I'll look for it in the morning, it's a little late to look tonight.” he replied, starting to slowly close the door.  We went in and watched Frosty the Snowman, which soon made me forget about the events of the afternoon. My parents made amazing caramel kettle corn, which I wolfed down while watching Christmas specials way past my bedtime. The last thing I remember was looking out the sun window and seeing a figure standing on the edge of the tree line.  
**12/22**

	I woke up the next morning in my bed, covered in my princess blanket. I sprang out of bed and made my way to the kitchen for breakfast. I went downstairs to find my mom reading the newspaper at the table alone with her cup of coffee. I jumped down the last four steps, landing with a reverberation \*THUMP\*, and rushed to the table to hug my mom as she glared at me. I started towards the kitchen to grab some food, but my dad busted through the front door in his ugly plaid winter wear.

“Jesus, George, are you trying to take the door off the hinges?” My mom said with the malice of pre-coffee disposition.

“I found something I think you both might like,” my dad said out of breath, “Come out and see!”

We walked outside to see the same Santa I had seen the other night standing on our front lawn in the snow. “Found him in the woods. I guess your eyes are not so bad,” He said to me, “He’s definitely ceramic.” my dad said knocking on it ”I’d say it weighs fifty pounds and is about seven foot, but he looks great.” He said as he walked back inside. “I don't have the energy to move him anymore and he looks good where he is.” My dad said with a sigh. He had set up Santa looking out into the forest it came from for the most aesthetic as possible. Though nobody would see it but the three close neighbors to us. I turned to go back upstairs from the doorway and had the sudden urge to look at Santa one last time, and as I turned on my heels to look back at it, to see it staring at me. 

“Hey, dad. Wasn't the Santa just facing the street?'' I asked.

“Uhhh,'' my dad retorted as he looked back outside, “Swore he was but must have put him facing the house. I’ll face him in the morning” he said as he closed the door completely. I went to bed that night feeling weirded out. I couldn't get the image of that Santa staring into my soul out of my mind as I faded into the nothingness of sleep. 

**12/23**  
	I woke the next morning to my mom nudging me to wake up. “It's time for school. Get dressed and come downstairs, breakfast is ready. I had all but forgotten the Santa in our front yard till I went outside to start my walk to school on the icy roads. I gave him a slight glance over and saw my pa's footprints all around it as I started to walk towards the road. 

“You sure you don't want skis?” he quipped as he stood at the door with a coffee cup in hand.

“No pa, I'll be fine. None of my friends are bringing skis anyways.'' I said with sarcasm as I started on my way to school. 

	After breakfast I started on my walk down the dirt road towards my friend's Houses. We all met up every day to head to school. I lived the farthest away and gathered everyone as I walked towards town. My parents and all their parents felt safer with all of us walking to school together, as they felt it was safe enough and no predators, human or not, would harm us if we were a group. We were all the same age and in the same class so we became super close, our parents even made sure we all had similar classes every year, much to the chagrin of our teachers. Our friend group, consisting of the closest to farthest from my house, was Jain, Stiv, Tucker, and Mia. All our parents moved in at different times, but had us all within the same four	 month of spring, which meant that we were all super close in age, but back then all that mattered was that within a four month section of the year, we had a birthday party every four weeks or so. 

	As I walked towards Jain’s house I looked into my metal lunchbox and saw that my mom had packed me a peanut butter and honey sandwich. Now I was never a very picky kid, but to me, there is a right way of making it. My mom always puts the honey on the bread which soaks in and makes it taste funny and gives it a rough texture which I hated. 

	As we walked and talked about what we were going to do after school that day. “My dad said that it is going to snow a few more inches today,” Jain said, looking up at a few flakes of snow coming down from the gloomy sky above. “We should sled!” We all looked at each other in agreement. 

	We nearly took down the front doors to the schoolhouse as we left on our way to go sledding. We ran all the way home, only stopping when Mia fell on her face on a patch of black ice. When we got to Mia's House, we all said we would go our separate ways and meet up at the edge of my house, which had an amazing sledding hill that went on for a good two hundred feet. 

	As I ran up to my house, I nearly had a heart attack when I saw Santa was now back on the edge of the treeline. I went inside feeling weird again. As I got in I saw my pa, sitting in front of his laptop and talking to his boss on Zoom. He was wearing a suit top and no bottoms. As I got in he said “Hey Yara! How are you.”

“Good dad. Thanks for asking.” I said in a loving tone. “Hey, why did you move Santa?” 

“One second Yara. Let me finish this meeting up.” He said going back to his laptop.

I ran up to my room to get into my sledding gear and to grab my sled that was hanging on the wall in my room. As I ran down from my room with my sled in one hand and a pair of mittens in the other, my dad walked around the corner, making me stop on a dime to not hit him. “Woah Yara! In a rush I see.” He said in a sarcastic tone. “Well, what did you want to talk to me about again?” 

“Oh yeah. Why did you move Santa?” I said lightly. 

“I uhh... I didn’t move him” my dad said with a hint of worry in his voice.  
	“Well.” I said, “He’s at the edge of the tree line again.”

“Well I didn't move him today and your mother left right after you, and I know she couldn't have moved it.” My dad said as he walked out the front door. “Well I'll be damned,"" he said looking from where Santa used to be to where he was now starting on the other side of the road 50 meters away. He walked over to where Santa once stood. A blotch of grass is shown in the blanket of white in the yard, where Santa used to stand. 

“Huh, it looks like someone dragged Santa across the street,” he said pointing at the skid mark in the snow. 

“That's not nice,” I retorted in a sympathetic tone.

“The question is… why? Are you sure you and your friends didn't do this?” My dad asked.

“I've been with them all day, it was there this morning, and when we all came back from school it was there,” I said pointing to where Santa now resided.

“Yeah, I thought as much. Probably some teens ditching school and playing a prank.” My dad said as he started to walk over to Santa. 

	Dad brought Santa back across the street, nearly being hit by our grumpy neighbor Renkin who lived 2 miles past our house in the middle of nowhere. As Renkins nearly hit my dad and caused him to drop Santa into the one bush we had in the front yard, we heard the sound of ceramic chipping as it hit the ground. After my dad started to pick Santa back up he called over:

	“Hey, get over here, I need help getting him out,” my dad said trying to move branches out of the way while heaving Santa up. I just stood there looking. “Now is as good a time as ever you little devil”

“Alright pa, coming,” I said as I started to run over.

“Hey don't run..” I heard my dad say as I hit a patch of black ice and fell backward onto my butt.

“You okay?” my dad said after dropping Santa back into the bush and rushing over.

“Yeah, ""I said, verging on tears, “My butt hurts,” I said, trying to laugh the pain away.

“You want to go inside or help me with Santa?” dad said after looking me over.

“I'm good enough to help with Santa a little bit,” I said as I scooted myself across the ice and onto the snow so I could get up without falling again.

I walked over to Santa in the bush. My dad grabbed the feet and I grabbed the head, thinking I was stronger than I was. We lifted Santa from the bush and carried him towards our curb, slipping on ice the whole way across the street and setting him down with a \*Thunk\*.   
	“Alright. That should do.” my dad proclaimed. “I don't see where he chipped anything off though. Weird.” my dad commented, “sure heard something break off when I dropped him”  
	Just then a gust of wind hit us, causing us to look out towards the west, “looks like a storm is rolling in. Let's head inside and enjoy some hot cocoa.”

 Later that night as I was just falling asleep watching The Land Before Time, my mother came downstairs. As she came to the landing, she stopped and turned pale as she looked in my general direction. “Ma, are you ok?” I said.  
	“Y… Yara. It's uh… it’s time for bed…” she continued in her worried tone. I got up from the couch and turned off the TV. As I started back up the stairs, I still saw my mother looking at where I was just moments before. I looked back and yelped. There, just outside the window, stood Santa, staring in through the window at where I once lay. His fat figure is standing, almost touching the window. I didn't get a good enough look at him before turning and running up the stairs, but I swore he was looking straight at me and my mother. 

We both rushed upstairs and into my parents’ room. “George,” my mother said in a rude tone at that time of night, “Why did you move Santa to look into the living room?” she said in a scolding tone.   
	My dad got up, rubbing sleep from his eyes. “What do you mean? I and Yara moved him to the curb, then came inside. Nobody has been outside since.” My dad croaked.   
	“Just come and see,” my mom said as she pulled him downstairs.

As we went down the stairs, we went to face the living room window, and there it was. This time I could feel it looking at us.  
	“Ok, that's it. Tomorrow morning I am getting rid of that thing, so help me. It's hideous and is causing no end of problems.” My dad in a creeped out voice. My dad went and closed the blinds, and rechecked the lock on all the doors and windows around the house. We all went upstairs and I finally went to sleep after my parents tucked me in and gave me good night kisses. But just before drifting off, I heard my parents outside my door whisper screaming about Santa.  
	“It was staring at Yara while she was watching a movie, George… I don't care if you have to smash it; get rid of it,” she said as they both walked away.

**12/24**

	I woke the next morning to my dad calling me from downstairs. I got out of bed to see my dad standing at the bottom of the stairs with the door wide open to the outside, where Jain, Stiv, and Tucker stood, sleds in hand. “Yara, come on, we got 2 feet of snow last night!” Jain said tapping on her sled, “It's perfect for sledding!”

“I'll be right down” I yelled, turning on the spot and rushing into my room to get changed. I put on four layers of clothing and flew down the stairs to the front door, barely hitting a single step on the way down, when I saw my mom sitting on the couch by the door staring at me.

“Goodness, we might need to put in a ramp just for you Yara if you keep refusing to use the stairs.” She said in a pre-coffee mood, “Did you ask if you could go play?”

“No Mom.” I started to lose excitement realizing I didn't get full approval. “Can I go out?”

“It's fine Yara, go and have fun.” My mom said, and without a second thought, I ran out, flying out the door, almost tripping on the bat my dad left by the door and right off the deck, into the dry, thigh high, icy snow. As I looked out, I saw the hulking yellow garbage truck slide to a stop on the road outside my house. “Hey Yara,” the garbage man yelled over. “Great day for sledding inn'it?” He said looking down at the haul. “Are you really throwing out this giant Santa?” He yelled over my shoulder at my father who had stepped out into the frigid morning air. “Yeah, it's been creeping out the whole family and I don't want to drive down just to drop it off.”  
	“Alrighty then” He called out. “Mind if I keep it? Looks expensive so may as well put it up in my yard.”  
	“Sure, as long as you don't bring it back” My dad called with sarcasm.   
	I raced to the top of the hill behind our house a couple hundred yards whilst racing the trio up the hill, stopping just before the forest where we always started. As we reached the top of the hill, we laughed and fought over who had won the race. 

“I won,” I said in a sassy voice

“Nat-awh” Said Stiv

“No, I won” Said Jain

“I think Yara won” Said Tucker

“Majority rules,” I said, sticking my tongue out at Jain and Stiv.  
	“Hey by the way, where is Mia?” I asked.  
	“We don't know. We went over and the front door was open. We called in and nobody responded.” Jain replied.  
	“I wanted to go inside but someone,” Tucker said looking over at Stiv, “Didn’t want me to do that.”  
	“It’s not your house dude.” Stiv snapped back  
	“Whatever,” Jain said, “Let's just sled. RACE YOU ALL DOWN” She said throwing herself belly first on her sled down the hill.   
	Just before launching myself down the hill, I heard the sound of a twig snap from the forest. As I looked back, I saw Santa standing at the tree line not 5 feet away. As I looked up, I dropped my sled and tried to scream, but it came out as a whisper. I heard my sled start to skid down the hill, and as I was just about to turn, I saw its eyes move to look down at me. His slightly snow covered head shed a clump onto my already snow covered boots. I fell backwards and started to scamper away on all fours. I finally got up and jumped down the hill on my sled, somehow landing on my sled with enough speed to catch up and pass everyone on the way down. As I made it to the bottom of the hill and started to lose speed, I rolled off and started to run back towards my house, not stopping when Stiv called after me, “Yara, where are you going?”  
	As I ran inside my house and slammed the door, my mother scolded me, “Yara! Do not slam the door. Go back out and take off your boots.” She said,  
	“I saw Santa” I said as I fell to the ground trying to catch my breath.   
	“What do you mean you saw Santa?” My dad said as he came out of the kitchen with a dish towel on his shoulder.  
	I started to cry as I spit out “I… I went… I went up th… the.. the sledding hill and just before I came down I, I, I heard a twig snap and then I, then I turned around, and Santa was just standing there.” I bawled. “AND HE LOOKED AT MEHE.”  
	Both my mom and dad ran up to me and embraced me. “It's ok dear. You are safe now.” My mother said in a loving tone.

Just as I stopped crying, I heard a knock at the door. My father got up to answer the door.

“Is Yara ok?” Jain asked 

“Yeah she's fine. Something spooked her on top of the hill.” My dad told them.

“Did she say what? We didn't see anything up there when we went up so I don't know what she could have seen” Tucker quipped.  
	“She said she saw the ceramic Santa that was in our yard.” my dad said. “But we just gave it away to the garbage man before y'all left.” my dad said, looking past them to where Santa once was.

My dad talked with my friends for a few more minutes before closing the door and coming over to me.

“Well Yara, do you think you are good enough to go back out and play? Your friends are asking for you” My dad asked, “If not, it's fine.”  
	“Yeah, I'll be fine.” I said sniffling.  
	“Before anything, are you sure you saw Santa?” My dad asked

“Yes.” I sniffled, I could have touched him if I wanted to.”  
	“Alright, I’ll call Waste Management and see if they can get ahold of Ishmael to see if he still has that cursed thing” My dad commented, pulling out his phone. “Why don't you go play outside and stick close to your friends?”  
	As I walked outside, my friends all ran up to me with worried looks.   
	“Are you ok Yara?” Jain asked, giving me a hug.  
	“Yeah.” I replied timidly. “It just - It just really freaked me out.”  
	“Well we went back up there and didn't see anything so hopefully it was a one off occurrence.” Tucker chimed in.  
	We played the rest of the afternoon in the snow, with the occasional parent coming over with hot cocoa, a snack, or new gloves for us so we could continue having fun. We had a few mishaps, one of which was Tucker going head-first into the tiny tree from Charlie Brown, giving him a nice whip mark across his face, and Stiv tricking Jain into eating yellow snow. But eventually the sun went down and so did we from the hill one last time. As we all split ways, we promised to meet back tomorrow after we opened presents.   
	“Does noon sound good to everyone?” Jain asked.  
	“Yep” was heard from everyone.  
	“Merry Christmas everyone!” I called back.

	When I got inside my mom got me upstairs and into a hot bath to warm up as I had snow in my ears and was about to turn blue. The bath was nice. When I finally got out of bed I went downstairs in my holiday PJ’s and went up to my dad who was sitting on the couch reading a book. 

“Yara I think it's time for you to go to sleep,” He said, seeing me visibly yawning.

“Fine,” I said in a huff. 

“Now go along now,” He said. “You had a long day and you know what tomorrow is”	  
**12/25**	  
	I woke the next morning to the smell of cinnamon and butter touching my nose and the joy of a kid on Christmas morning. “Good morning dad.” I chimed   
	“Come sit down you two” my mother cried from the kitchen, “monkey bread is done”  
	I wolfed down the monkey-bread in excitement to open presents. That morning was wonderful as I opened the dozens of gifts a single child gets on Xmas and watched my parents sip their coffee and open the presents they got from me. My final gift was addressed to me, from Santa. I tore open the large gift to reveal a brand-new sled which was taller than me with a good foot.   
	I squealed “CAN I GO USE IT!?!?!?” 

“Sure,” my parents said, giving each other a silent argument over who was to clean up the trash on the ground now. I ran outside to find Jain and Tucker sledding down the hill. I called them to show off my new sled.

“Woah!” Tucker said, “You get that for Christmas?” 

“Yep. Speaking of, here's your Christmas presents,” I said, pulling out two small boxes and handing one to each of them.  
	“Yara-,” Jain stammered “I'm Jewish and my parents don't like me getting gifts.”

“Fine.” I said, throwing it at her, “Happy Hanukkah or whatever. Just take it. It’s just a bracelet,” I threw over my shoulder.  
	The three of us ran towards the hill as fast as we cooked, kicking our sleds with every step. As we reached the top of the hill I stopped and turned to see Jain and Tucker finally catch up. “Hey, Where's Stiv?” I questioned.

“I don't know. We knocked at his house this morning and got no answer. Not even smoke from their chimney”. Tucker said.

“Huh, maybe his parents took him out of town for Christmas,” I suggested

“Maybe. Could have been a last minute trip” Jain chimed in.

“Well nonetheless let's continue sledding,” I said, setting my sled down on the snow track. “I got room for both of you. You two want one?” I asked.

“Yeah,” they chimed in unison.

As we came down the hill, rolling over a jump to the side of our house, we saw all of our parents grouped on my front porch with two police officers.. We all rushed over, leaving our sleds behind.

“. . . Well, we need to go looking for them.” I saw Jain's dad speak up.

My mom looked over and saw us coming up “Thank goodness you all are here.” she said, exasperatedly, “when was the last time you all saw Stiv?” my mom asked us all.

“Yesterday when we went home” we all murmured, not knowing what was going on.

“Why?” I chimed up.

“No reason, sweaty,” my mom said. “Some nice policemen are here looking for him,” She said with a waver in her voice. “Go inside with Jain and Tucker and show them your new toys.”

	We all went up to my room and pressed our ears against the door trying to listen for anything we could hear about Stiv from the police downstairs. We only heard muffled talking with a few words about a breaking and door open.

	Eventually, our parents all came into my room and sat down around us. A few of them had faint tears in their eyes. There was some awkward mumbling as they all fought not to be the first to speak, looking from one to another. Tucker's dad finally broke the awkwardness and sat down and said, “Guys. Stiv’s family was robbed last night. Their house was found broken into with items scattered everywhere.” He went on. “Everyone is missing and we are looking for them.”

	The parents comforted us for a while, whilst they cleared up details and such to make us believe that he and his parents had left. After a while Tucker and Jain went home with their parents and went to sleep. 	  
12/26

	I woke up the next morning to my mom and dad sitting down at the table in our kitchen.   ""Good morning Yara."" said my mom as she sat down with a bowl of cereal for both her and my dad. My dad set down his newspaper as my mom sat down and put his hands on his head as he started to look over towards my mother.

""Three more missing this morning. Including Ishmael and Renkin. They found Ishmael’s truck abandoned with the windows smashed a couple miles down the road."" my dad said as he looked at my mother. ""I don't know who could be doing all of this or what sick type of person it would take to kidnap so many people in such a short time.”  
	“Who’s Ishmael?” I said.   
	“The Garbage Man,” my father said.

My mother butted in, “I don't know how so many people are going missing, but it scares me,” said my mother. “It's happening all around us.. I don't think sending Yara to school would be a good idea.” she said.

“It's up to you.” My dad said looking at me, ""Do you want to go to school or stay home and get homeschooled?” 

“I think I'll go to school,”  I said, grabbing some of my papers for my classes. ""I want to go back! We have a word project that I need to present.” 

“Okay.” My mom said hesitantly. ""But if anything happens we're going to homeschool you.” 

“Fair enough,” I said.

“Go get your book bag and get ready for school. You're running late.”

	 Just then I heard a knocking on my front door. I ran over and opened the door to see my friends Jain and Tucker standing with their backpacks. ""Are you coming to school today?” Jain asked.

“Yeah, I got a late start. Give me 5 minutes and I'll be out the door.”  I said running upstairs to get changed.

“Yeah sure, just warm the entire outdoors while you are at it Yara.”  my dad called from downstairs.

“Sorry,” I called back.

 On our way to school that day we were talking about what we thought was going on  
	“I heard it was some clown who was kidnapping people for the circus,” Tucker said.

“That's stupid. It's probably just some creep who is lonely.” Jain said.  
	As we walked towards school, we had to deal with very icy roads which kept making us slip and slide the whole way. As we arrived we noticed our custodian shoveling off snow from the front walkway to allow students to get into the building.

	 Classes started normally that day until second-period science when I was walking outside and noticed a faint red shave from the tree line about a hundred feet away next to the playground. I stared at it for a good 2 minutes trying to decipher what it was. It looked faintly like the Santa Statue that Ishmael took. Just as I started to think more about it, my name was called by the teacher to answer a question. After stuttering and passing the question off to another classmate, I looked back out the window at a spot where I thought I saw Santa, to see nothing but a bare treeline without a hint of red to be seen. ""odd” I thought as I returned my mind to the science lesson.

	 A few hours later, the Bell finally ran signaling the end of lunch and the start of lunch recess. As I stampeded out of the cafeteria, I noticed Jain and Tucker hanging out near the swings. I went up to them and started to chat about how our days have been going so far. We all got on the swing and swung for a while. “So what do you think happened to Mia and Tucker  
until the final bell rang. As we started to head back in for our Collective PE class, Jain stopped; “Hey I forgot my jacket back at the swing set” she said starting to go back. “I'll catch up with you two in a minute,” she called back, running towards the swings. 

“Don't be too long,” I called back. “Don't want to cover for you again.” 

	Gym class started and we started doing warm-up exercises while Coach Christina called out attendance.

“Yara”  
	“Here” 

“Tucker”

“Here”

“Jain.” She called out, “Where is Jain?” She said, looking towards me and Tucker. 

“I don't know,” I said. “She said she left her jacket by the swing set as we were coming in and we didn't see her come back in.”

My PE teacher's face turned pale as she turned on a dime and ran to the principal's office which was just down the hall from the gym. As she left she yelled at us to get out the dodgeballs to start playing as she nearly busted down the doors leading out of the gym to the playground.  We all continue to play dodgeball till an announcement came over the intercom,  
	“Code Adam. Code Adam. Everyone please stay in your classrooms.” The crackly speaker belched. I learned from my dad last year that a “Code Adam” was just a way to say a kid was missing.  
	We all turned to each other in confusion when the gym doors burst open with the gym teacher and principal in hot pursuit.   
	“Everyone to the corner of the gym, right now!” Coach Christina called out.  
	We all started to run to the back corner. I huddled up with Tucker in the very corner. We started to talk with people around us about what's going on. Then Tucker piped up, “Do you think this is about Jain? I haven't seen her come in yet” He said.  
	“I completely forgot. Maybe we should ask” I said, starting to make my way towards the gym teacher. “Hey Coach,” I said in a hushed voice, “Where is Jain?”  
	“Not now Yara.” She said harshly. 

	 The drill lasted 2 hours and had quite a few police officers walking through the gym and outside in and around the playground. Eventually, we got the all-clear and we were told to head to the Assembly Hall for an assembly. As we all walked, we started to talk about where we thought Jain was. As we stepped into the assembly hall, we were stopped by our PE teacher and two police officers.   
	“We need you to come with us.” said one of the officers, ""It's about Jain.” 

	We walked into the principal's office and were told to sit down in front of her desk. We both took seats and put our backpacks under our chairs. As we did the second officer started to question us; “So when was the last time you two saw Jain?”  the police officer asked in a tone that was hard to read. 

	“We were playing with her on the playground…” Tucker said. ""The bell rang and we all started to walk inside when Jain said that she had left her jacket on the swing set. so we just continued to walk while she ran back to get it expecting her to catch up in a minute.”

“Alrighty,” said the police officer turning to me, ""that truly what happened?”  he asked.

“Yes sir. Just as Tucker said she ran back to get her jacket."" I said.

“All right kiddos, any chance you could show us the path you took with Jain and the general areas you were in while at recess,” the officer asked in a nice tone.

“Sure, why not,” we both said.	

We walked to the cafeteria with the principal and police in tow. “We sat here and after the bell rang we walked out the left side towards the swings where we stayed for the whole of recess.” We took the officers and walked the path we took to get to the swings almost step for step. Upon arriving at the swings where we had left her, we walked to the section of swings on which we had been and sat down on them. “Jain was in the middle of the two of us,'' I said pointing at the swing in the middle of the two of us that was vacant. As we were saying that the police officers, the older one bent down to look at the swing and took a step back;

“Well there's a jacket here,” he said in a gruff voice, looking out at the sand and wood chips that surrounded the swing set. “don't see much else around here. No chance to track shoeprints as there isn't an inch of fresh snow around here” he continued as he got up, cracking a few joints in the process. 

The police officers started to walk over to the sand on the far end of the swing set. Tucker and I started to follow but were stopped by the principal and told to go back inside in a worried tone that took us by surprise, as he had always been a very timid person. 

The Principal said, ""Go back to the assembly."" We walked back into the school and were immediately swarmed by dozens of kids asking us questions all at once about why we were with the police and a few asking where Jain was. We didn't say anything and just walked to the cafeteria. Luckily the principal held the kids back so we could eat in peace. 

	As we walked home from school that day I could feel the absence of Jain looming. The walk was silent till we came upon Tucker’s house. “Cya around,” I said in a gloomy tone. 

“Cya,” Tucker said as he opened his front door.

As I walked home my mind ran and reran what happened at school. Jain just ran back for her coat. Why would she just disappear? It all seemed so surreal. 

My mom and dad were standing in the doorway as I walked up to my house. 

“Hey, sweetie. How are you doing?” my mother said as she knelt to give me a warm hug. I knew something was wrong as my mother only used the term ‘sweetie’ when something bad had happened.   
	We spent a good hour just talking that night. About what happened at school, and about Stiv.  
	“I know this is rough, but they will be found soon.” my mom said  
	“Alive.” my dad commented.  
	“Not helpful George.” my mother said as she elbowed him. “Anyways, It’s time for bed. We will keep you home tomorrow as well so you can sleep in a bit,” I got up and hugged my mom and dad, and as we hugged, I looked out the front window and did a double take. There stood Santa. “Are you alright Yara?” she said to me, turning to see what I was staring at. “O my god George!” She screamed as she picked me up in one big swoop. “Why the hell is it at the window again??? I thought you got rid of it!”  
	“Screw this” my dad grumbled, ""I'm breaking that thing into pieces.”   
	My dad went outside with his wooden baseball bat by the door and walked up to it. Me and my mom ran out the door after him. “George, be careful.” my mom cried.   
	My dad swung the bat back over his shoulder and straight down onto Santas head, cracking half of Santa's head off onto the ground, and breaking the bat in two.   
	“Fucking piece of shi…” my father yelled, throwing the bat aside and moving towards the figure. As he went to push Santa over, I saw the glint of Santa’s one remaining eye move towards my dad. Right as he touched it, he disappeared. Just then a gust of wind blew a wall of snow at us, hiding Santa from sight. As we averted our eyes, we looked back in horror. Santa didn't have more than a small chip of white on his head. In fact his head was back together, and worse, he was smiling even wider, showing glistening teeth and staring straight at us, bat sitting on the ground, still shattered. 

“Yara” my mother cried, “RUN!”  
	“What about dad” I cried, getting pushed inside

“He will come inside later” my mother lied, “Just get inside.”  
As I ran upstairs, I heard the front door fall down and a cold gust of wind traveled up the stairs.   
	“Yara, go into the crawl-space.” my mom ushered me.  
	I didn't hesitate. As much as the creepy things inside scared me, nothing could ever top Santa. As I rushed into my parents closet, I rushed to open the safety latch for the hatch leading into the crawl-space. Just as I opened it my mom slammed the door of the closet shut behind us. “Yara, get in.” She said, bracing herself against the door. As I climbed into the crawl-space. I heard a massive thunk from the door. My mother lurked forward, then bounced back at the door, trying to hold it closed. “Go Yara” My mom cried as another hit knocked the door from its hinges, sending my mom into the wall again. She crumpled to the ground and as I looked back, I saw a red mass standing in the doorway. I scurried further into the crawl space and around a corner. I waited for hours for my mother to come around the bend to meet with me, silently crying, but she never came. Darkness turned to dawn and I soon heard the distant cries of people outside calling my and my parents names. I refused to come out for anyone, eventually a firefighter came in to assure me that all was fine and helped me out. As I crawled out, I saw the door on the ground and a hole in the wall where my mother landed. “Where is my mom?” I whimpered.   
	“We are looking for her,” the fire fighter said, “What happened here?”

2/12/21  
	“So Yara,” my therapist, Meredith said in a kind tone, laying out a set of games onto the floor, “are you up for talking today?”

“...”

“Alrighty then, well why don't you come out from the stuffed animals and play a game with me. We don't even need to talk, ""she ushered. I reluctantly crawled out from my cozy hiding place amongst the beanbags, stuffed animals and pillows and sat down. 

I had not much since I left that crawl space, Meredith was the first person to really talk to me after I was admitted to the mental hospital, and even then, I never really said more than a one or two word response to her, but she was kind, so I listened to her as much as I could, ""I'm trying to help you get better,” she would tell me. One of the main ways she tried to get me to open up was by playing videogames. We played a multitude of games including Checkers, Sorry, and Uno. I really liked Uno but it just has not felt the same since that day left me all alone in this world, like the last card in my hand.

I’ve had some minor thoughts of wanting to take a couple sips from the bottle just to “relax”. I’ve been feeling anxious and depressed so that’s probably why I was craving it. I know the booze won’t fix my problems and most definitely won’t help me get over this flu.

1ppjjcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1ppjjcp/dismal_doors_part_1/,Dismal Doors Part 1,"""How long did you say?"" Asked the scrawny man sitting in the passenger seat. A raspy tone filled his voice from years of smoke inhalation. Likely responsible for the stench within the cabin.

The driver let off the gas a moment, and released his left hand from the worn wheel of the 1987 Ford Lariat. He began to quickly roll down the window. *cough* ""About 9, wanna take over?"" His voice had a drawl, but with the same accent as his passenger; West Coast. He takes a moment to inhale a long breath while pellets of hail bombard the interior, followed by a strong gust of icy wind.

The passenger partially guards his face with the collar of his hoodie, yelling over the cliff's downdraft. ""Of course Bro! Let's just st-"" before he could finish, the driver rolled up the window. ""You could've left that open, it's cool.""

""I'm all right now; just wanted a little fresh air."" The driver scratched at a patch of razor burn high up on his cheek. ""How 'bout we swap in Bridgeport after we grab some coffee?""

""Sounds good.""

The interior of the cabin was littered with various sports drinks and to-go bags, a bottle on the floor was filled halfway with a black, tarry substance. Several grocery store bags sit behind the men; Filled with more bottles, wrappers, and bottles filled with the tar. Besides all the garbage, the interior is in pristine condition. In the bed of the truck are three large bags, one significantly larger than the two. A few moments of silence passed, and the men pulled off the highway and into the nearest mini-mart.

The driver hopped out of the truck. He wore a burgundy sweater, size 14 hiking boots, and a pair of dark-grey cargo-style pants with a large pocket on either side, that bulged slightly. His rear pockets appeared empty while his wallet and phone sat in his left and right front pockets, respectively. Letting out a large groan, he stretched and then looked into the back seat as the passenger leapt out of the vehicle. ""Yo, Theo!""

Theo let out a similar groan as he stretched his legs and began touching his toes. He wore an oversized hoodie stuffed with a bag of marijuana, a small glass pipe, a paperclip, and an empty Bic lighter. Baggy blue jeans sat crooked on this thin waist in absence of a proper belt, the ends being tucked-in to the tops of his size 12 Osiris'. ""What's up?!"" He shouted beneath the truck.

The direction of the sound made the driver jump momentarily. He scanned his surroundings and saw a large dumpster alongside the minimart. ""Let's toss this shit before we head out; getting ripe in there.""

""Copy that. The usual?"" Asked Theo.

The driver nodded, and the pair split up as soon as they entered the establishment, Theo went straight for snacks and necessities, while the driver went for coffee.

The driver seemed displeased with the coffee selection. He tried the Maxwell House, but winced at as he did so. Next he began to try the Folgers, but noted that the grounds in its reservoir was completely full, while the dispenser and subsequent tray beneath, was covered in dust. ""You must be the un-popular one,"" he muttered to himself. Deciding on the Red Diamond roast for the both of them. He topped off his own brew with some creamers, then unloaded ten creamers into the passenger's cup, and filled the remaining volume with fresh steaming coffee. The steam felt good on the driver's face, so he opted to forego the lid on his own cup and sip right out of it. He capped-off the passenger's coffee, pocketed an extra handful of creamers and started walking towards the counter.

The two men head towards the cashier. She must have been around 50 years old. A short woman, with hair that fell to her shoulders. Theo gingerly rested a pile in front of the woman: Two bags of peach rings, two bags of butter-toffee peanuts, two bags of southwest trail mix. A bottle of Ibuprofen, a six pack of Coronas, a new lighter, and a tall can of sour cream and onion Pringles. ""Hey, do you guys have a restroom?"" Asked Theo.

She nodded and turned to grab a key with a large toilet scrubber attached by a length of paracord.  
""Just down the hall,"" she pointed down a short hallway. ""Door on the right. That towel things likes to jam, be nice to it.""

Theo nodded and made a brisk walk down the hall, quickly shutting the door behind him.

""Where're you boys headed'?"" Her voice was calm and trustworthy, but frail, as if she had been crying. A stark contrast from her hands that raced across the surface of the table, grabbing and scanning the items.

The driver grabbed the Ibuprofen and sat it back on the shelf before she could scan it, ""We're visiting every National Park; On our way to Glacier right now.""

""Gotcha, are you sure this will be enough then?"" The woman asked with what felt like genuine concern.

""Should be, but if not, we'll be passing through Spokane in a few hours; We can stock up there.""

""Fair enough, I.D?"" She held out her free hand, the other placed on top of the Coronas.

The driver quickly pulled a card out of his wallet and handed it to her. She froze, her voice choked as she fought back tears. ""I-I'm sorry I just need your drivers license."" She handed it back, he looked down at his Common Access Card and apologized.

""Sorry ma'am, my mistake."" He pulled his drivers license out and handed it to the woman, he waited a moment as she inspected it, slowly. ""You okay?""

She looked up from the card and wiped her eyes. ""Y-yes,."" She composed herself, ""That'll be $15.97.""

*The bathroom door creaks loudly as it swings open, grabbing the cashier and driver's attention*

Theo walks out patting his hands on his hoodie and pants, noticing the receipt in the driver's hand he shouts from across the mini-mart, ""What the hell man? Thought I was getting this one.""

""You are."" The driver turned his attention to the cashier, ""Can I also get $50 on pump 2?""

""Of course, dear."" She said warmly.

""Oh so it's like that?"" Theo said sarcastically, handing the woman a crumpled $50 bill out of his hoodie. She looked down at the bill with a minor look of disgust before swiping it with a pen to confirm its legitimacy.

""Should be good to go now, here's the receipt."" She starts handing the receipt to Theo, but he refuses.

""Sorry ma'am, I don't wanna leave a paper trail."" Said Theo as he turns towards the automatic double-doors. She rolled her eyes and threw the receipt into a small trash can behind the counter. The driver followed behind shortly after.

As the driver was about to leave, she ran around the counter. She firmly wrapped her thin arms around the drivers waist and buried her face into the small of his back, sobbing. The driver was stunned, unable to speak, all he could do was try to turn around to see the woman's face.

""I'm so sorry."" She sobbed, stepping away. ""M-my son was, he. He was. They sent him t-""

""It's okay, what was his name?"" Asked the driver in a soft tone of voice.

""Nicolas,"" she sniffled then looked up at the driver, ""his friends in the Guard used to call him 'Saint Nick', after he grew out his beard"" she chuckled, so did the driver.

Theo looked back at them through the storefront's windows, from the pump stall. Once he got the driver's attention he mouthed 'what the fuck?' and gestured at a imaginary watch on his wrist. The driver nodded.

""I oughta get going ma'am, I'm sorry about your son.""

""Please,"" she wiped her eyes one last time, ""just be careful,""

""I will."" The driver walked out of the mini-mart with a waving gesture towards the old woman.

""What the hell was that about?"" Theo squinted at the driver as he approached.

""Her son was National Guard, we was killed during the Liberty Collapse. His name was Nicolas...""

""Woah. Sounds like bad juju Nik, lets get the fuck out of here.""

""Copy that.""

Nik and Theo hop back into the truck, taking time to adjust their new seats before pulling back onto the highway.

An hour into the drive, Theo says ""-Oh shit, we totally forgot to dump all this"" Theo gestured with his thumb at the mound of trash in the back seats. ""There's a Safeway in Spokane, we can just unload there.""

""Sounds good,"" said Nik as he began rolling his window down, the storm had died down to just a couple hard gusts. He sat staring at the swollen Spokane River, watching the churning waters eat up vegetation along the banks.

In an instant, a portion of the road in front of them is swallowed whole.

""Fuck!"" Screams Theo, in a panic he slams on the breaks and veers the car to the right, away from the river. Upon leaving the paved road, the passenger-side tires lurch downward as more of the roads foundation slips away. Theo starts backing up, but the tires find no purchase on the asphalt. ""What the fuck did I say Nik?!""

""Yeah, yeah bad fucking juju! Now ain't the time, dawg!"" Yells Nik as he begins to unbuckle.

The truck starts to slip further into the river while Theo easily climbs out, as he does so the weight distribution is thrown off, Nik's side is sent further down. Nik scrambles out of his seatbelt, crawls over the center console, and falls on to the remaining road, tweaking his shoulder in the process. Theo, who was pulling the bed of the truck down for leverage, loses his grip and is sent backward, slamming the back of his head against the concrete before blacking out.

Nik dusts himself off and sees Theo on the ground, unconscious. Choosing to abandon the Lariat, he sprints towards Theo, scoops him up, and keeps jogging into the woods as more of the highway and pieces of the embankment disappear behind them. He goes on for what feels like hours, until coming across a clearing in the woods.

In the dark, illuminated by the full moon, Nik spots a small shack. A large wooden door marked the entryway. As Nik drew closer, he couldn't help but appreciate the neatly chip-carved geometry of the door. Curves undulated across it's surface, as if it were being seen under murky waters. He hoists Theo onto his shoulder, and takes hold of the handle. His hand sank deeply into the bronze casting, the ergonomic fit pulling, urging him into the frame, across the threshold. Upon opening the door, he loses his footing and falling on to wet cobblestones before collapsing from exhaustion.",1,1766037996.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1ppjjax,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1ppjjax/two_dumb_old_famous_people_who_semi_hurt_me_years/,two dumb old famous people who semi hurt me years ago,"two famous people did some odd things to me about 8 years ago. these two people were kirk and james of metallica and it involves witchcraft. It's a long story but I was supposedly supposed to meet Kirk hammett and lose my virginity to him years ago but he and james hetfield did some kind of bizarre witchcraft on me and they kept our interactions through this strange method. It was really wrong of them to do this and they acted as if I was so lucky to be getting their attention since they were 'metallica', but it was the strangest, weirdest most f\*cked up situation to exist. I was just a fan at their show and literally got victimized by them in the strangest way possible. They make their victims feel like they're lucky to get their attention in any way because they are 'metallica' and it's the dumbest thing to exist.

i was also supposed to meet them but they had little interest in meeting me, and were just playing games. one even talked about marrying me. well james hetfield is dating some female named adriana and he even divorced his wife possibly because of the situation that was happening with us- it's a long drawn out story that involves weird paranormal stuff. It's not that i was anyone important to them and i reallly don't care but it pisses me off what they put me through and what I had to go through and in the end they just date their wives and girlfriends and used me as some side project to do weird sh\*t to. Kirk and james are both fakes and losers who do bad things to women and fans and they are capable of who knows what and this involves the things they do to fans secretly. They even invited me to go on tour years ago but didn't try to make it happen, it was like a fake invitation. Kirk said metallica would be my 'sex slaves' or some bullsh\*t and it was all fake and lies. Not that I care. 

They're awful and not normal or nice people and it's a messed up situation. They do still think about me and i know this because of things I can't get into but really I'm not on the top of their list anymore. if it wasn't for some other weird sh\*t that happened to me Kirk hammett was trying to get me to meet them or just go and witness them at metallica night. I'm not even a fan but a part of me is still kind of bitter about all of this I can't get into all the different reasons why. James is just a betraying jerk and they are fake people who enjoy leading people on and doing bad weird crap to them. I'm not sure how to feel abotu this anymore

for instance- metallica cancelled their australian tour because of something that happened to me and they 'finally' played in australia finally after years.

they played in abu dhabi in december because my birthday is in december and its a long story

they came to daytona florida rockville and began playing in festivals because of me and now play in festivals regularly and started a skateboard and coffee company too because of this- this was years ago.

they did a lot of things pertaining to 'metallica' because of this game that was going on between us.

Kirk will never update his twitter because of what happened between us and the last thing he posted was of a black mercedes and it has to do with all of this.

Now james is just some punk who has a girlfriend and doesn't care- what a prick. a part of me is just semi-bitter and i cant' get into why. James even did things with metallica's art concerning this situation and it involves a lot I can't get into. kirk said to me many years ago that 'metallica is nothing without me"" not sure why. anyway this is a very weird situation. I'm not sure how to feel about it and should probably just forget about it all.",0,1766037990.0,WhatShouldIDo,1,0.5,False

I was wondering if God in the World of Darkness and, by extension, the Saints and Elohim were not Umbrood.

because there is this whole chicken and the egg situation when it comes to the spirit world. how much it shapes the material and how much the material shapes it. And since the Abrahamic faith has been dominant in the Western world for one and a half thousand years, it would have an impact.

But as the first commandment of the Abrahamic faith for three millennia, wouldn't that make the spirits formed from the beliefs of two-thirds of the planet... a contradiction in terms?

Maybe around 1000 BC, when the Levitical laws were in full swing, the Jagglings and Gafflings of the Twelve Tribes began to see themselves as idols, and let's say... hmm.

How about we use a Christological term, committed kenosis (self-emptying)? choosing non-existence over paradox.

Then a carpenter from Galilee and a warner from Makkah later, who leave such an impression on the umbra that they form their own concepts, do the same.

I think this is a way to keep the Fallen from DTF and true faith away from the umbra and all those questions about celestines and incarna. 

We could even have saints and angels almost form. come to these realisations that the concepts that they are, which are lenses to understand the All-maker, become opaque if they stick around. Some are going out in a dignified manner; others are breaking down into tears at their existence that is anathema to their goals and melting back into the umbra.

Imagine a journey by mages or werewolves into the deep Umbra to find ""Limbo, Gethsemane or the dry place"", where it is assumed all these Christian, Jewish and Muslim spirits go. As these faiths are still around, it's obvious that the Kenotics didn't destroy themselves. but choose absence. they find nothing except themsleves and horrible things to slay to avert terrible time... with a little help administered in ""mysterious"" ways.

Maybe we could have something that looks like Saint Catherine, Mary Magdalene or Miriam falling apart crying literally. in the arms of a Black Fury nun. in despair, ""I cannot be what they want me to be... and do what they ask of me.""

Or an angel steps up like it's a flu shot and accepts kenosis with dignity.

Perhaps Dismas could help a ragabash steal something to attain release.

Maybe have Longinus ask some mages or some celestial choristers to kill him.

Maybe a saint or an angel lashes out violently when someone or something tries to stabilise them.

This in no way precludes an Umbrood from taking on Christian trappings. halos, choir singing, and church coffee mornings. but I think it fits White Wolf's hodgepodge of half Gnosticism, the Watchmaker's God, and full-on polytheistic pagan animism.

It would explain the patriarch. the weaver incarna. the seed of dogma born of religious extremism. we could have garou try and stop this God ocsed spirit form making a son or servant of its own. have it become a kenotic and then it fights it dad alongside the garou.

**AIO for telling my coworker to stop talking in a baby voice**

Hi reddit! Longtime lurker first time posting. I (22 F) have an odd coworker (22 F) and like the title says she does talk in a baby voice. When I first came to work at our company she was quiet and never talked to me and I understand I am new why would she want to talk to me but me being the person I am I wanted to try to have a relationship with my coworker because we are going to be desk to desk so I would just start out by complementing her on her clothes and got us to start talking from there. I finally had my foot in the door and now I don’t have to sit in a quiet awkward space with her.

Until one day she started speaking in a baby voice and at first I thought it was a joke but there was no joke that was made. It was just her speaking to me and I just awkwardly laugh and I just went back to what I was doing. I thought it was a one time thing maybe she was making a joke and it just didn’t land for me but I was wrong.

It was not a one time thing almost everyday now she at least speak in that baby voice once and it is starting to make me feel uncomfortable because now she will come over by me and talk to me in the baby voice and just start acting strange such as walking by my desk stopping staring at me and walking away, waiting for me when I go on my lunch and recently I was talking to another coworker and she comes over to grab a cup of coffee she turns to look at us stares and scoots over and says “Can I play?” in the baby voice laughs and walks away. My other coworker was stunned but then we both laugh awkwardly and we tried to go back to our conversation.

So reddit AIO if I tell her to stop talking in a baby voice because it is making me uncomfortable?

**Comments**

**Dangerous\_Sun9982**

*i’ve (19f) actually had this problem in high school. this girl would not stop with the baby voice. at the time i never said anything but if it were me now i would say, “why a baby voice if you don’t mind me asking?” with as much kindness as i can muster.*

**Miserable\_Concern\_81**

*It's very possible she was either a victim of SA as a child or is simply autistic or has a speech impediment. I'm autistic and a victim of childhood sexual abuse, because of that, I find it difficult and uncomfortable to talk 'normally', and even when I do there still that but if 'baby voice'. My advice is, don't judge her, you don't know her circumstances, if you really need to know why she talks like that, ask her kindly.*

**\*\*Judgement - NTA\*\***

**Update - 1 day later**

Hi reddit. I talked to my coworker. I never thought this would’ve happened but here goes.

I grabbed my coworker aside and said I needed to talk to her. She followed me to the break room and I asked her about why she sometimes spoke in a baby voice whenever she was around me. She looked at me and began to laugh and I was caught way off guard. She was laughing so hard that she started snorting.

She eventually stopped but it felt like she was laughing forever then she walked out of the break room and came back with our other coworker and they were laughing together. At this point you are probably as confused as I am.

Turns out it was a prank because I was new to the company and they were waiting to see how long until I “broke”. I started working here in August. I beyond words and I am embarrassed because this was all just a “prank” but genuinely felt weird about this coworker and come to find out it was a prank because I was new. I smiled awkwardly and laughed because I didn’t know what else to do. All I can say is that I am embarrassed that it took this long for me to realize it was a prank.

**Update - 9 days later**

&#x200B;

Hi Reddit! I am back with an update. The reason why I took so long to respond to some comments is because I was trying to handle how I was going to approach my coworkers.

So from my last post my coworkers were pulling a prank on me by making one of my coworkers speak in a baby voice for months and act creepy.

After realizing it was a prank I did feel very embarrassed but some of the comments made me realize I have nothing to be embarrassed about because it did make me uncomfortable and how was I supposed to know it was a “prank”.

I decided to confront my coworker the one who did the baby voice (for this explanation I will be calling her Ericka a fake name). I told Ericka that the prank made feel uncomfortable because I genuinely didn’t know how to confront her about it and I didn’t want to overstep but it became very uncomfortable when she would watch me.

Ericka looked at me and laughed. She told me that I couldn’t take a joke and that I am being immature. Ericka than told me that I am nothing special that our other coworker who was in on the prank (for the sake of the explanation her name will be Bre a fake name) was also doing it another girl in a different department. Not only were they doing this to me, they were doing it to another girl and I was completely shocked.

I walked away and decided to go to HR. This was getting out of hand and it may not seem like a big deal to most people to bring it up to HR but this had been going on for months for me and I wasn’t sure how long it was going on for the other girl.

I told HR everything and surprisingly they had believed me. They had apparently been having issues with Ericka and Bre for a while with these so called “pranks” but since the other people they did “pranks” to never brought it up to HR directly. The only reason HR knew about the “pranks” was because of office gossip but since it was never formally reported there wasn’t anything they could do.

Eventually news got back to Ericka that I had reported her and Bre to HR and it was a cluster f**k. Ericka started screaming at me in the middle of the office to the point other floors could hear her. Bre came up to her trying to calm her down and then Ericka told her that I reported the both of them and they both then started screaming at me. Ericka started throwing all my things off my desk and Bre started stomping on all my things.

They completely lost it and were escorted out by security and fired. I am not an exciting or overly extrovert person and I’ve never experienced this let alone heard of something of this be this crazy so sadly this was the most exciting part of my year. Take what you will but I am amazed by the fact people can be this absurd and act like this.

As of right now I am not sure what happened to them because they never return to pick up their items. I talked to the other girl they did this to and apparently she suffered way worse than I did to the point she had to go to therapy and for privacy reasons I will not go into detail and all I can say is that she feels so much better with them gone. This will be my last update.

Thank you to everyone who gave advice and thank you for making me realize that this is bullying.

Adding more context: the other coworker who was being “pranked” was not being “pranked” the same way I was. It was way much worse and that is all I will say.

**jarofgoodness**

*Good. Here's how you know for a fact you did the right thing: if they thought and expected you to agree that it was harmless and you shouldn't be upset by it, then they should have had no problem with HR knowing about it. According to them HR should also agree that it was harmless and wouldn't be a problem. The fact that they knew HR wouldn't think that because they got upset that they got reported is proof that they understood that it was harassment and not harmless.*


**Confident_Proof338**

*You really handled it right 😊 Most people go around bullying people without knowing how it feels to be bullied, so am happy when I see them going through what they make people go through*


**Silvaria928**

*It may sound like a crazy story to others but not to those of us who have been in ""mean girl"" situations. I'm so glad you reported them to HR. This sort of behavior requires consequences and it sounds like these two never faced those much before.*

The theme of the review seemed to be ""perception"" because that's what he used to justify everything that he said; in actuality the *real* theme was ""Projection.""

I'll just get right into the main topics that have bothered me since the review:

* **Job Performance & Time Management:** Some context, up until a large project I recently finished, I hadn't needed to work any overtime to finish prior projects on time and correctly. That being said, I'm paid hourly as opposed to my manager whose salaried. He's constantly brought up that I'm not working overtime while at the same time acknowledges that it's because I haven't needed to (confusing I know). Yet on the large project I earlier referred to, I did have to work overtime, and he ended up lecturing me about not managing my time properly. Yet the reason I had to work overtime was because he sent half of the project to me late, giving me a shorter window to complete it, and had someone new try to help with a portion but they ended up creating more work for me that I had to fix over a weekend. As this was happening I made him aware of the issue and again when the project was submitted. However, he went on to lecture me about time management and having to take overtime to complete the project, despite me explaining why I had to take overtime. This was a huge topic during my review today where he brought it up again and I explained, AGAIN, what happened and he would not and did not hear me. It's basically as if his mind was made up and he used this singular project to determine my job performance and time management. He also went on to complain about the fact that I can get paid for my overtime while he can't (he's been working overtime almost every week the past 6 months) and he's admitted to projecting his frustration (or is it jealously?) onto me, but continues to bring this up as if it's my fault. He's also made comments regarding ""why wouldn't you want to take overtime"" and I've stated to him that ""I have no issues with overtime, but if I don't need it I'm not going to take it.""
* **PTO:** Another topic of my review was my PTO. We have flexible PTO (there's nothing in our employee handbook or anywhere stating a cap or soft cap on PTO). Recently there was a c-suite meeting discussing PTO usage across the company and he brought up my PTO usage in my review as if the amount of PTO I took was an issue, but at the same time said it wasn't and that his ""perception"" was skewed because HE wasn't able to take off when he wanted to (the example he gave was that he had family in town but was unable to take PTO because he had to work overtime). Though as that topic continued he in a way shamed me for taking the amount of PTO I did which was 124 hours, and went on to say I had taken more than each individual on the team. I then reminded him that 32 of those hours were because my dad was dying (and did die) and he instructed me to take PTO and all the time I needed. After I reminded him of this, he responded with ""oh that was this year?"" So in actuality I took less than everyone on the team INCLUDING HIM. Even after reminding him of this and him acknowledging it, it turned back into ""well you took too much and its about perception.""
* **Lunch:** Buckle up - to reiterate I'm an hourly employee. Maybe once a week (if that) I would grab coffee with a coworker during lunch of which we have a full hour (and some change) to do so. His issue is that when I do this I don't eat my lunch during that hour and instead eat my lunch afterwards at my desk while working. He explained that people may perceive this as me not taking my lunch hour to actually eat (I'm still trying to make sense of this one). The hour itself is unpaid and personally I'm under the impression that it's my hour to do with what I choose. I feel like I got in trouble for using my hour for what I choose and eating my lunch at my desk (while I'm working) later in the day. I wish I had a rebuttal to him regarding this point, but I was just baffled that it was even an issue. And I very much don't want to bring in what other people in the office do to this post but I feel it's important here: other people will eat their lunch at their desk while working later in the day as well. Granted he's not over them, but it's just my *perception.*

I'm honestly at a loss of what to do. Even after I explained my side of things, it just fell on deaf ears, as though his mind was already made up. I feel like my work ethic and character were attacked, that my using PTO was weaponized, and that he just doesn't like me. The weird part is we do get along for the most part, but at the end of the day he's my boss, and I care about my job and doing a good job, but clearly his perception of me unfair.

Important to note, this is a small company with less than 50 employees, so there's not state mandated HR department. Our handbook is pretty outdated and doesn't address the three points above. I would ask if this is worth going to HR about, but I don't know how to even do that, or if I should considering the facts.",1,1766036731.0,WorkAdvice,1,1.0,False

1ppj5j1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ppj5j1/im_so_tired/,i'm so tired,"This has been a really hard year for me. At the start of the year, I started a new job as a grit packer/delivery driver after a coffee shop I worked at went out of business. What I didn’t know was that the job did not have many hours, and I was working maybe 4 hours a week, and I was actively losing money working there. Around mid-January, I had emergency surgery to get my appendix removed, so I was out for about a month recovering. I finally got a job with the help of a friend I made at the coffee shop, with better pay and hours, as a beertender. Unfortunately, it was an awful workplace, and I very rarely saw my family and loved ones. This went on for about 7–8 months, when my job suddenly closed, leaving me to go back to the grit place. I’ve been out of a job for about 2 months now, and I’ve worked maybe 2 shifts, and every time I’ve been like, “Hey, I’m here,” I’ve been told, “Oh, I won’t need help on this.” I’ve applied to other jobs and have been told, “Oh, we’re looking for bartenders, not beertenders,” and when I’ve said I’m willing to learn, I’ve been turned down or told I’m just not qualified. I have a friend who is a broker in charge at a local real estate office, and he sent info about a class, and if I get my license, I can have a job at his office. I’m taking my final exam Friday, and if I pass, I can take my state and national exam and become a real estate agent, but I don’t even know if this is what I want to do. For years now, my goal was to start my own business, but working around small businesses and seeing them close, as well as being told I’m not qualified after applying to work at similar jobs, I just feel so defeated. Now getting this feels like my only option, but even this is an unpredictable market, and if I don’t pass my exam, I have to take the class again, and I genuinely can’t do that. I feel like such a failure, and I can’t talk to anyone about this. I’m sorry if this is hard to read. I haven’t slept in about 2 days from studying and stress.

They’ll blame inflation or say prices “change too often,” but that just feels like an excuse. Not showing prices upfront pushes people to buy first and think about cost later. It’s manipulative and completely lacks transparency.

I don’t care if prices go up. Just be honest about it. Hiding prices feels like a deliberate move to make customers less price aware and more likely to overspend.

Most houses would be multistory traditional and cape cod houses, with a small row of town houses, and an obnoxious McMansion at the edge of town (lol) as well. It would also include a grocery store, park with a lake, and a community center.

I (27F) have a quiet crush on someone at work. Nothing dramatic just the kind where you suddenly become hyper-aware of your posture and vocabulary whenever they’re around. I usually keep things professional and calm. Usually.  
  
This morning, I was running on very little sleep and way too much coffee. I got to the office early and was setting up my desk when my crush walked by and said a casual, “Good morning!”  
  
Now, in my head, I had a perfectly normal response lined up. Something like, “Morning! Hope you’re doing well.”  
  
What actually came out was… not that.  
  
I smiled too fast, stood up too quickly, and somehow combined three different thoughts into one sentence. It came out sounding like,  
“Good! I mean...morning....hope...yeah.”  
  
Then, because the universe enjoys chaos, I immediately knocked over my water bottle. It didn’t spill much, but the noise echoed far louder than it had any right to.  
  
He paused, looked at me, then smiled. Not an awkward smile. A genuinely kind one. He said, “Sounds like one of those mornings,” and helped me pick up the bottle before continuing on his way.  
  
I sat back down, face warm, heart racing, wondering how a simple greeting turned into a full performance.  
  
The rest of the day went completely fine. He acted normal. No weirdness. No teasing. Just quiet professionalism and the occasional friendly smile.  
  
TL;DR: Overthought a good morning, fumbled my words, knocked something over, and was reminded that small awkward moments don’t have to be disasters, sometimes they’re just human.",20,1766035839.0,tifu,3,0.95,False

Served in a delicate Wild Strawberry patterned Wedgwood cup, the coffee was strikingly bold. It carried a distinct smoky aroma and a deep, velvety bitterness. There was almost no acidity, making it an incredibly smooth, heavy cup of coffee that demanded me slow down and savor every sip. The tiramisu was the perfect companion to such a robust coffee.

1ppituc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ppituc,How to I start?,"Hey everyone! I’m looking to start intermittent fasting and I’ve tried in the past but cannot stay on track. I’ll set my window from 10-6 and then something happens and I can’t eat dinner until 6:30 for example.

Mornings are tough because I love coffee but haven’t developed a taste for black (if anyone has a fav brand I could try I’d appreciate it!)

What kills me is I used to be in such great shape and then 2020 happened and I slowly started gaining weight, but it was gradual over the past 5ish years I didn’t really notice how much until I saw myself in a pic from work 😞 and stepped on the scale and I’ve gained 20 lbs.

So I’m needing advice….I want to  lose quickly but I also want it to be sustainable…is 16:8 a good place to start? Also, what should I be focusing on eating during my window so I’m less hungry while fasting? Protein, complex carbs….?? And yeah if anyone has any advice on how to love black coffee you’d be my hero lol

1ppitfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Positivity/comments/1ppitfq/i_replaced_morning_doomscrolling_with_sunlight/,I replaced morning doomscrolling with sunlight and everything changed,"A few months ago, I noticed something was off. Every morning I woke up feeling tired, even after a full night’s sleep. Before I even sat up, I was already on my phone. TikTok, Reddit, news, emails. By the time I got out of bed, my brain felt noisy and scattered.

I brushed it off for a long time because it felt normal. Everyone checks their phone in the morning. But deep down, I didn’t feel good. I felt foggy, irritable, and flat. I struggled to focus, my mood dipped early in the day, and most afternoons ended with a crash.

I didn’t want to completely overhaul my life. I barely had the energy for that. So instead, I decided to experiment with a few small habits and see what happened.

I added a short walk outside most evenings. I started drinking water before coffee in the morning. I did a couple of short workouts each week, nothing intense.

And the biggest change was this, no phone in the morning until I got real sunlight.

At first, it felt strange. Just stepping outside and looking at the sky for a few minutes seemed almost too simple. But within a week, something shifted. My mornings felt calmer. I felt more awake without forcing it. My anxiety softened. Even my sleep improved, which I wasn’t expecting at all.

I wasn’t perfect with it. I missed days. Some mornings were cloudy or rushed. But overall, that one change gave me a sense of steadiness I hadn’t felt in a long time. It made mornings feel intentional instead of reactive.

A few things that helped me stick with it:

1. I drank water before caffeine, which surprisingly helped me feel more alert.

2. I went outside first thing, even if it was only for a few minutes.

3. I paired sunlight with something I enjoy, like music or light stretching, so it felt rewarding.

Some extra resources that helped:

1. Atomic Habits by James Clear: [https://www.amazon.com.au/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/1847941834](https://www.amazon.com.au/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/1847941834). This helped me stop thinking I needed to fix everything at once. Small changes really do compound.

2. The Huberman Lab Podcast: [https://www.hubermanlab.com/podcast](https://www.hubermanlab.com/podcast) His episodes on light, dopamine, and circadian rhythms made the science behind sunlight finally make sense to me.  
  
3. Bright Start: [https://www.brightstart.app](https://www.brightstart.app). Came across this here on Reddit. It locks certain apps in the morning until you scan real sunlight. Simple idea, but it helped remove the willpower battle for me.

4. The Mel Robbins Podcast [https://www.melrobbins.com/podcast](https://www.melrobbins.com/podcast) Her conversations around habits, motivation, and getting out of your own way were incredibly grounding and  encouraging.

If you’ve been feeling burnt out, foggy, or disconnected lately, please be gentle with yourself. You are not broken. Sometimes your nervous system just needs a quieter start to the day. Start small. Step outside. Let the light hit your eyes. It adds up more than you think.",8,1766035536.0,Positivity,9,0.9,False

Most of my family has passed, and I've also had to let go of multiple toxic relationships this year.  

Being forced to sit with myself is triggering past  wounds, and I don't know how to make it stop. 

I've had to do life alone for so long and im exhausted ... 

I'm not bad at socializing, but I always feel extremely unfulfilled afterwards. I have friends, but no one who truly gets me. I'm craving deep intimacy...I have a new potential love interest,  but I'm afraid I'm not stable enough for a healthy relationship. He seems very normal and I'm afraid I'm going to come across as defected. 

The void of no family is hurting me so bad I'm close to breaking.   

I'm checking all of the boxes- I'm doing intense psychotherapy, I attend networking events frequently, I joined a fitness class and I work at a coffee shop most days. I feel like I run out of energy from having to operate my freelance business on my own. I want my business to grow but that would require more isolation/computer time.

This year, the RVA Meetup community launched the Richmond Meetup Challenge to support Feed More to run from November 24th through December 21st (this SUNDAY), aiming to make a tangible difference in our local community. Many of our neighbors face hunger, and we believe our meetup community can help.

What sets RVA Meetups apart? We NEVER charge fees for our members, ensuring our gatherings remain accessible and welcoming. However, this also means we seldom ask for anything in return.

Here’s a straightforward way to GIVE BACK:

\- Several RVA Tech Meetups are participating in a challenge to raise funds for Feed More over the next month.

\- Each meetup will create a fundraising page for Feed More.

\- Members can contribute whatever they can—$1, $5, $10, or more. 

\- We will track totals by meetup and celebrate the top fundraisers.

\- All funds will go directly to Feed More to provide meals for families in our region.

\- Feed More turn EVERY $1 donated into 4 MEALS!  

There are individuals in RVA who are going hungry tonight. Everyone can help change that. Imagine fasting for the next 24 hours; at the end, you could either prepare a meal or get something to eat. But what if you couldn't? Consider not eating for two, three, or four days. Hunger is a real issue. 

Let’s demonstrate the strength of our community! Healthy competition can lead to real impact—together, we can provide thousands of meals. 

I personally run both RVA.js (Richmond's JavaScript meetup - in our 14th year!) and RVA Code & Coffee!  I'll include a link to each meetup participating with RVA.js 1st and RVA Code & Coffee 2nd.  ",1,1766034921.0,u_KashMoneyBrothers,1,1.0,False

Support said no receipt = no help. Okay, cool. Instead of throwing this into the garbage, I opened it up to see if I could fix it or at least learn how to clean it if I decide to buy another. There are a bunch of design issues in this machine that cause hot coffee to leak and accumulate at the bottom, which will eventually burn or short the thin signal cables. Then there is this ultra‑complex combustion‑engine–like intake valve system that uses a really thin membrane. Most importantly, you will never get rid of the gunk that accumulates on the head. The whole design philosophy behind this machine is to throw it away after a year or less. I wonder if anyone actually used this machine for more than 2 years?

In one day it will be two months since my ex committed suicide. We seperated in July, dated since 2022, and we had an unrequited friends to lovers to enemies to lovers ark over the span of 9 years. I thought he would be the one I married. I was deeply attached to his lack of care for me, due to my cptsd.
For most of our relationship, he was an avoidant. He broke up with me in a state of mania three seperate times, and ultimately pushed me away. When I took him back the third time, he could feel that withdrawal and became anxiously attached. He picked up a bad habit of emotional abuse when things didnt go his way, and I was not allowed to spend a night away from him. I got fed up, and decided to take my life back. I was neglecting my own needs, home, and hobbies for him. 
He did not handle the break up well, and began concerning patterns bordering harrassment and breaking and entering with gifts of love and passion like rings and portraits he had painted of me and my animals. This lead me to breaking contact, which lead him to threatening his life. He left me alone for a couple weeks, then October 13th I let him back into my life with a weird feeling it was we he needed to do, and he was behaving in extreme guilt for his actions. He was kind, caring, and even asked for advice in handling the grief of our relationship. He stepped away to speak on the phone about an appointment reschedule with a new therapist he was beginning to see. We laughed, watched birds, drank coffee, and told stories of what life had been like without eachother. I will never forget how happy he seemed for me I was healing from years of trauma and codependency.He told me he was gonna spend the rest of his life making up what he had done to me, I told him I loved him but I wouldnt let him, and he left this world only three days later. 
This may be the experience to break me forever, or heal me. I hope i can continue to guide myself in the right direction. This corner of grief is dark, scary, and lonely and only adds to the guilt i have felt since i could have a conscious thought. He was only 23, I am only 23.

They are both mentally ill, and I had limited contact with them because of that. I also had limited contact with my dad because of them. My dad had a traumatic brain injury in 2014 and inste of working to get better he kept drinking and getting head injuries. By 2018 he was in a nursing home. I used to make the 3 hour 1 way drive every month to see him, but soon the abuse from my brother was too much. 

I don't even know how to explain my brother and sister in law. They have been together since middle school and have crafted their own version of reality. My brother fabricats traumatic events from the past and berates people over them. 

On this particular day he stormed out of lunch and walked to my dad's nursing home. I had lunch with his wife while she cried and we talked over some things. We had no idea where my brother had gone, but after lunch were heading to see my dad. He called as though nothing had happened and told us to go get my dad coffee, so we did. 

We were in the nursing home less than 10 minutes before my brother had another episode and tried to storm out. I stood in the door and told him he couldn't keep storming off like a child. My brother is much larger than I am, but he's an alcoholic who doesn't work or move much, and I'm a fitness instructor, so he wasn't able to remove me from the door. Until he grabbed me in a chokehold and dragged me back into the room.

I am a martial artist and I ran through what I could do, but I'm in a nursing home. A tiny room with my frail dad. So I protected my airway and followed where he was dragging me. 

A nurse came in and my brother let me go. He started crying and screaming ""she wouldn't let me leave, she wouldn't let me leave.""
I told him just go, I don't care anymore. The nurse starts yelling at me. He leaves. His wife is crying and telling the nurse I didn't do anything. The nurse then goes on a tangent about how important family is. Sister in law is still defending me, explaining I'm there to help them. I'm just nodding and waiting for this to end.

My dad thought the whole thing was funny. Which I found upsetting, but given my dad had severe dimentia I wasn't mad. Just sad. I know I hugged him and said goodbye. I think we stayed a little while after that. But it was awkward.

Somehow the day got worse. My brother wound up at a duck pond sending suicidal texts to me and my mom on the other side of the country. My mom was freaking out. Long story short nothing got better, despite attempts to reset and salvage the attempt to help them avoid their impending eviction. At the end of the night mt brother told me he was going to press charges against me, because he tried to explain protein and muscle gains, and I told him his understanding was incorrect. He needs to be correct about everything, so he went nuts. I told him his attitude, and complete lack of qualifications were a problem. He went batshit again.

I left and decided to go no contact. 

On Saturday I woke up to 2 pages of missed calls from my brother and sister in law every 10 minutes for an hour. One from my mom and one from my uncle. I looked at it and thought, ""well, my dad's dead. Who do I want to hear tell me that news?"" I called my uncle.

My brother has basically kept my dad like the one ring. He's controlled him, who can see him, who can talk to him. He never even told my uncle my dad's home had a phone and he could call him. It wasn't until I visited my uncle that  I found this out and got him the number. 

The first day we talked when my dad died things were fine. But the next day they were in a manic state. It's been 5 days and I'm now dreading when the clock striked 9 because that's when they usually start up with their insanity. 

I don't know how to plan a funeral with these people. I don't know how to morn my dad. Without my shitty brother it's so complicated. My dad has been gone for years. And after his brain injury our relationship was severely damaged. I found out my dad had basically lied to everyone he knew, was a different person to everyone in his life, and manipulated people to keep them from talking to each other to expose these lies. But I loved my dad.

For background: I know I don’t tolerate caffeine that well. I’ve had many instances where coffee makes me shake and extremely anxious, but, I’ve also had moments where I drink coffee and am completely fine. Anyway, I don’t drink coffee that much, if I’m in the mood for a beverage, I’ll have a matcha. 

This brings me to now. I just got a job at an energy drink company and I’ve never had one before (which is completely fine). Since I’ve started, I’ve been very curious on trying one of the drinks just to see what they taste like. I know I’ve had some bad moments with caffeine, but I was doing some research and saw that a large coffee from dunkin/starbucks is about the same amount of caffeine that’s in the energy drinks (200mg), if not more. So today I finally caved and tried one. I didn’t finish it by any means, I had about half (maybe less than that honestly). I felt relatively fine all day until now. It’s midnight and I am SO anxious and my stomach is in knots. It’s a very similar feeling to what I’ve experienced when I’ve had anxiety attacks after coffee. And not I’m just stressing about how I need to wake up early for work tomorrow and I can’t seem to calm down. With that being said, I’d appreciate any advice anyone has!

I’m (25M) fairly new to the city and figured I’d give this a shot. I work in software engineering, live in LaSalle, and I’m trying to actually build a social circle here instead of just working and going home.

I’m into low-key hangs: grabbing a coffee or a beer, smoking a bit of weed, walking around, having deep conversations about life, the world, reality, whatever comes up. I also really love nature, but winter here is new to me and I honestly don’t know where to start or what people usually do.

Most of my free time is after 5pm on weekdays and pretty open on weekends.

I’ve been feeling pretty lonely lately and don’t know many people here yet, so if you’re also looking to make friends, or if you have suggestions for groups, activities, or places where it’s easier to meet people in winter, I’d really appreciate it.

Thanks for reading ✌️",14,1766034300.0,montreal,3,0.94,False

Not because of any danger, more so just, because I don’t know if there is any meaning in sharing it. But if someone else out there comes to my same situation, maybe the experience I had can be useful.



It’s funny how the brain can skip over some things that seem impossible. We’re so aware of our own fallibility that I’m almost certain now we’ve all had instances occur to us in which the laws of reality glitched or broke in some way, and we just skimmed over it. 



Not that the mind is secretly some kind of infallible beacon of truth. The opposite probably. It’s more that we know so little in reality, that the laws of physics we invented are just as flawed as the eyes that read them, and the brain that understands them.



A couple of days ago, October 10th, kept happening. But the first time, the first time I lived through the same day twice. I didn’t even notice. 



I was on my phone watching Youtube. October 10th. I watched the hours tick by, occasionally pulling my phone screen down to see the time, which included the date. I saw it so many times. 



Oct 10, 9:00pm

Oct 10 10:00pm

Oct 10 11:00pm

Oct 10 12:00am

Oct 10 1:00 am



Nothing happened. There was no blackout, no fainting, no bang, no crash, no light, no alert, no warning. 11:59 turned to 12, and yet the date hadn’t changed. It had stayed the exact same. 



It took me until 2am to even really realize that discrepancy despite the date screaming itself at me. Checking it, It was still supposedly Friday. But that couldn’t be right, Friday had already happened.



Sure something was just wrong with my phone, I ignored it and stayed up another hour before finally ripping my phone out of my hand and letting the sleep desperately scrabbling for purchase over me my hand.



My daily routine wasn’t the kind of thing that had lots of variation in it, so for me there was no smoking gun. No thing that kept happening that alerted me to the sameness. That was everyday for me.



My alarm rang at 8am, and I deleted the app.



I woke up at 2pm, having missed my one Friday class, a noon class by the way.



My apartment room was filthy, covered in full trash cans, empty bulk ramen containers, and a laundry bin that had been so full that the ground around it was now likewise covered in clothes.



I walk through and don’t bother brushing my teeth. My entire day consists of making myself my one luxury, really nice coffee. Then food, then returning to my bed, and watching more Youtube. Sometimes switching which distraction I used. Computer games, reading short stories and fanfic, anything. 



Then I took a shower, this was a must for me. No matter how bad I got, no matter what, I took a shower everyday. It was more for my mind than my body, but it was nonetheless important.



Lots of time was spent staring at the Bluetooth head of the shower nozzle, and feeling a profound sense of distaste for its very existence. The implication of external noise being fed into my shower felt like an offensive concept. I know no one was making me, and plenty of people enjoyed it. I would often hear my older sister's music playing from her shower when we were both still young and in the same house.



But the shower was my one bastion away from the internet, from my headphones, from any kind of screen. To still find some way to make sure you can get stimulation in there as well, it just felt wrong. 



A Bluetooth shower. The only way you could further encroach on my inner mind is if you managed to hook up my skull to vibrate to the tune of a song.



I walk past my sink, feel a sinking sense of guilt for still not brushing my teeth, but drown it out with nice vices and colors on a screen.

It looped again.



I ignored it again, and went to bed far too late. But when my alarm blared at 8am the next morning, I stared down at it with bleary eyes. It was an application called Alarmy. Which would make me do math questions or memory games before I was able to stop the alarm. Afterwards it would give me a notification in about 3 minutes, checking I was still up. If I wasn’t, it rang again.



All of which could be circumvented by just deleting that app, which I had taken a bad tendency towards doing. 



There was just one issue.



I didn’t redownload it last night. I had deleted it, and intended to download it again Sunday, so that I could ignore it when it tried to get me up for my Monday classes.



Friday, October 10th. 



I got on my computer this time, still in my underwear, but a deep existential confusion washed over me as I clicked the date. October 10th. My college app had my schedule on it, and informed me of my class that was in a couple of hours. My Friday class.



Staring at the screen wasn’t helping, and I was already up, so after about a half hour of blank staring and mindless confusion, I made myself coffee.



This was my first experience with a time loop admittedly, but not really. I worked a fast food job for a year before heading off to college. Which, I told people was for money, but was really because I worked through a semester, then messed up some paperwork and had to skip another semester.



It was a shitty job, but if you’re ever interested in the broader issues that come with looping time, try out the monotony of a fast food job. It’s like micro-dosing pure meaninglessness. 



Still I had walked away from it a couple thousand dollars richer, a year older, and with a distinct affinity for coffee. The sugar added, flavored creamer mixed kind.



It was funny to me that despite that being my *thing,* that easy hobby to fix into a conversation. Despite coffee being that for me in a lot of ways, I hated the actual taste of it. I only liked my fake sugar-coated version of it.



Not much interesting happened for quite a few days. Or repetitions. I’d eat, drink coffee, watch videos, sleep, wake up, then repeat. 



It just. Didn’t stop.



For whatever reason, I became convinced this was some kind of glitch. A bug, like in a code. Which I could just continue existing through, and eventually it would stop. Just ignoring it, all of it. The inherent question of the physics defying nature of it all. Not seeing any actual other people with whom to ask if they were experiencing something similar. Just…continuing. Into infinity if I had allowed it.



Time just kept going. But I didn’t. I stopped. The world around me stopped. But, even then, did I? 



A pause would imply absence. But, cogito ergo sum. I think therefore I am. 



And I was.



I was and I was and I was



I was I was I was I was I was I was.



Even now, I am.



But the irrefutability of that fact didn’t mean I had to accept it.



Given the plethora of tools at my disposal with which to do so, I could run from my own continuing mind quite easily. Youtube, Tik-Tok, Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus. 



Youtube alone, even with no new content, could’ve subsisted me for probably centuries with no need to actually ever think at all. There were more than enough people who would do that for me.



But even my own mind, as deeply hooked on it all as I was, could feel a growing numbness. A sheer kind of boredom and loneliness that you can’t quite name.



It was rather pathetic when you really broke down into what got me moving.



I had a homework assignment, which required me to read my textbook. Having elected to do that tomorrow for the past ten or so days, I eventually at some point decided finally to just get it over with. Something to change up the pace at the bare minimum. 



Staring at the pages, reading the words about Nicaraguan revolutionaries, I started tearing up.



I don’t know how to describe it properly. Nothing about the text was making me sad. Nothing external at all was of any real depressing status for me. Yes my world and time itself seemed to have folded in on itself, but that had yet to present itself in the way of tragedy yet. Just, continuation. Repetition.



But, finally having torn my mind away from entertaining personalities recorded to interact artificially with me, to me, at me, I was forced to reckon in some way with, well, me. My eyes skimmed the pages, but my internal mind finally got a chance to breathe as I lifted my hands from the back of its head, which I had been holding deep underwater.



The first thing the bastard that was my mind did was flood me with the desire to cry, for no reason at all, proving that really I should’ve just kept it under, kept myself sedated, and not had to deal with it.



Maybe I should've broken down crying then and there, and something better would’ve come of it, but I didn’t. I didn’t like to cry. And there wasn’t much reason either. Not that I understood. So I just didn’t. I was a failure as a guy in a lot of ways. But at least I didn’t cry much. I didn’t want to lose that one positive trait as well over literally nothing.



I decided to do something I hadn't done in a long while. I put the book down, threw a heavy flannel coat on, grabbed my apartment keys, and left my room. Checking my phone revealed that it was midnight.



There wasn’t much in the way of fine dining this late at night, but there was a Wawa right next to my apartment, well within walking distance. Hands in my heavy pockets, I walked.



The night air was cold, and when I glanced up I could barely see the brightest stars piercing through the haze of light pollution. I passed through some other late night strangers, a few people employed by the big grocery store just sitting in their cars after they had finally finished closing. A couple of people pulled into the nearby McDonalds which closed down their dining room at 11, but stayed open for drive through all night. Probably a drug deal or two that I was intentionally trying not to pay too much attention too.



I felt my shoe hit something, and I looked down to see a little ice cream cardboard container. A plastic spoon still in it, just sitting on the sidewalk. Just litter. I reached down to pick it up, and tossed it in the trashcan when I found the entrance of the Wawa. 



The little thing was so insignificant, but I couldn’t help thinking about it while I walked through the gas station, looking at the pre-made meals for my perusing.



I picked up a soda, and a buffalo chicken wrap. Used the self checkout, and then headed out.



A voice called out to me, and two people sitting by the entrance were looking right at me. “Yo bro! Hey man, can I get a sec?” 



I probably should’ve just ignored them. That’s what everyone else had seemed to do. But more than anything, I just felt an instinctual response bubble out of me before I could really judge my options and make an informed decision. “Yeah what's up?”



It was hard to make out faces in the dark, but it was a man and a woman, both older than me, but still pretty young. Probably late twenties early thirties if I had to guess. The man had long dreadlocks, and was on the thinner side, but he spoke with a full and friendly voice. He held up his palm which had a bunch of coins, mostly silver quarters and nickels, but with a few pennies that stood out. “Hey man, do you have any cash you can spare? I’m counting coins at this point, but if I got a little bit more, me and my girl could get a room over there. Otherwise we’ll have to sleep out here again.” He nodded off in the distance, where I knew a motel was.



“Sorry man, no cash.” Which was true, and he could probably tell. My comfy coat, while truly the height of luxury, was also beat to hell. With one big hole under the armpit, and another smaller but more noticeable one below the coat pocket.



He nodded and I walked off.



But I couldn’t help thinking about it. Money didn’t really matter to me now. I’d just loop. Things would just repeat. So, why bother worrying about my admittedly dwindling finances? By the same logic, maybe he’d just end up here tomorrow, but, for today, for this loop. Maybe he and the woman with him could sleep in a bed.



Maybe they were just asking for cash so they could go see one of the probably drug dealers around here. Hell that was probably more likely. But, I didn’t know anything about them. They were perfect strangers, I had no room to judge, to impart my own feelings, or express any kind of judgement. 



I just had a choice.



There was an atm right next to the grocery store. Not really sure why, it wasn’t like they didn’t accept card. But at the very least, I got some use out of it. Withdrawing fifty dollars from my immense wealth of a hundred dollars.



I could see him recognize me as I walked back, he had been talking with his girl, who I hadn’t heard speak at all. But she got quiet as she noticed me approaching.



The guy looked back up at me, and I dropped the fifty dollar bill into his hand, and turned around to walk off without saying anything. 



Being thanked always made me feel guilty. 



So I just brushed past it, and left them either to their drugs or their sleep without having to thank someone much younger yet somehow a little more financially stable. In fairness, most of what I have isn’t earned, but given from loving parents. It’s not like I earned those fifty dollars I gave them. I just happened to have it when they didn’t.



I started making it a habit to pass by the Wawa, pick myself up some sweet drink or food, and drop some money in their hands. Asking them how much they specifically needed winded up giving me the number twelve fifty, so I started bringing 20 bucks along with me to hand them after.



They obviously never remembered me, and giving them what was potentially just drug money didn’t feel like it was at all of any use to me as a person stuck in time, but well, it was nice to see someone happy.



It made me think quite a lot. 



When he got the money for the hotel, he was happy. Sleeping in a hotel was a downgrade for me, my room was much more comfortable. Yet, I was unhappy. The upwards movement mattered more than the place he was at. And for me, upwards movement wasn't possible. Not anymore.



It was a couple days into that new routine that I realized something strange. My body retained its status, even if the world around me all reset. 



At one point, when opening a ramen packet with a pocket knife, I nicked my finger. Which I wrapped in a bandage. When the time change happened, the bandage was just gone. But the mark remained there. The little red line with white skin sticking out against it.



The next night, I cut my finger on purpose at the crack of midnight, watching my phone timer. The blood landed on my blanket. Then at twelve, I blinked and it was gone, and yet, another droplet fell right down on top of it, from the still open cut. 



The slightly gruesome idea of leaving tally marks on my body came to mind, but I decided knowing how many loops had passed wasn’t nearly as important as the pain doing that would cause.



A couple loops after that, I decided to go to the club.



A bit of a wild change in tune for me I know, but I had been getting bored of the same old entertainment types, and wanted something new to drown out my internal dialogue. Plus, I wanted to see what the loop in time was like for everyone else. So, where would people be past midnight on a Friday? 



It helped that having an apartment so close to a big collage meant I had lots of choices around, and one within walking distance.



It was great. Loud noises, drinks, lots of people all mindlessly enjoying each other. 



I helped a larger man get to a trashcan to vomit, started guiding him out before he shook his head, told me he was fine. An hour later, I saw him getting another drink. What a guy. 



Deeper into the night, I caught a girl's eye. To my surprise. 



I was at the bar when she came up and asked if I would be willing to do some charity work and spare a poor girl from having to pay for her drink. I thought it was funny, so I bought her one. I technically had Infinite money after all. But I am a stranger to these kinds of places, and didn’t realize how blatantly she was flirting with me, nor that I had somehow smoothly laughed at her joke and reciprocated.



We talked and danced a little, though I was cognizant that I probably shouldn’t be doing it. I had a girlfriend. 



We met at my old fast food job I mentioned. She was a much better worker than me, and I…well I'm still not sure how I feel about her honestly. 



I don’t know. Dating her just felt like what I should do, maybe more than what I wanted to do. I really don't know.



There was no issue with her. She was nice, funny, enthusiastic, a good worker, a smart person. To want more was greed beyond measure, but I don’t even know if want was the right word. I don't know why I don't love her.



It’s hard. And even with eternity to spend thinking about her, I don’t have my feelings in order. 



But dancing with this girl, it still felt a little wrong. We didn’t do anything bad, mostly just eye contact while we moved and smiled at each other, enjoying the music and the feeling of so many people right around us.



When I checked my phone, it was about 10, meaning I had two hours before time looped. At the same time she grabbed my arm, and I looked over at her. I had to lean in to hear her speak, and she yelled that she was tired and drunk, and was heading home. She wanted to know if I wanted to go with.



I sobered up quickly as the offer was put out there. My mind jumped to a bad place. It made excuses for me in advance. I was in a time loop. Nothing really mattered. In an hour, she wouldn’t remember I exist. This never happened in any way besides in my mind. Not really much different then porn right?



I thanked her, told her to sleep well, paid for her uber, gave her my phone number and told her to text me if she sobered up and still wanted me over. Knowing that the number and memory of me would be gone by the time she went to bed.



Then, I walked out to the bushes near the club, and I vomited.



A lot.



Think I was crying too. So much for being a strong man. But I guess I never really was.   


I rolled over onto my back, having gotten out of view so most of the other partygoers wouldn’t see me or think to help. I was also outside, which meant I’d have to just go home. I didn’t want to wait in the steadily forming line to get back in.



Staring up at Orion's belt in the sky, I could feel my puffy eyes and the vomit still on my tongue as my chest heaved up and down. 



It wasn’t fair, I don’t think. That any good things I did would be meaningless by the next day, but I alone would have to live with all the bad.



How much different really was that from real life though? No one would ever care if I did or didn’t give that couple money to sleep at a motel. But, cheating on my girlfriend was just wrong. Always, forever. 



It was hard to grapple with. Nothing I did mattered. So, why shouldn’t I do whatever I want? It would never affect Laura.   


But at some point. At some point it would end right? It didn’t feel like it at the time, but that was how the world worked. Time would move again. And I’d have to live with what I did. 



Even if I was the only one who remembered everything. There would still be a me that walked away from this all. 



When I looked in the mirror, who did I want to see? At the end of it all? 



Even if my relationship with Lauren wasn’t what I wanted, even if I didn’t know what I wanted, even if I was here forever, even if I couldn’t really breakup with her over text just out of sheer principle alone, I didn’t want to be the kind of person who cheated. 



My life can get worse. It will, inevitably, that was the nature of a world of ups and downs. I’d have good days and bad. But I didn’t want to ever hurt other people. Maybe it was my one redeeming quality. Maybe it was just another weakness. But it was something core to who I was. 



Would this have hurt her? Even if she never knew, somehow, cosmically, I think yes. As if the slight against her would reach out across the world, the awful action stretching across the space and the time that I had been stuck in, and it would hurt her.



Somehow it would hurt her. I didn’t want that. I didn’t know what I wanted when it came to her, but it wasn’t that. Never that.



I wish I never went to the stupid club.



The last of my meager wealth for the day was spent up on the girl’s uber. So I was left to either walk, or spend the remaining hour of my time in the grass next to my vomit outside of the club. The vibrations of its music strong enough that I could feel it on my body, let alone hear it.



Sighing, I found a nice tree where I could see some of the people of the club dancing, and I just watched them, nursing the nausea from vomiting.



It was hard to even tell it happened. But at midnight, when I blinked, it was all new faces dancing. All the people from Thursday who had stayed until midnight. All these people who were here every time the loop started.



This night also revealed another of my theories, that I could go wherever I wanted. I wouldn’t wake up in my bed. If I fell asleep, I’d wake up on this tree, probably prodded awake by the club security guards to get going.



Lucky me, my infinite money was back. I could uber back to my apartment, drunkenly stumble up to my room, fall into my bed, and sleep. Missing my class once again.



If you’re familiar with time loop stories, and you’ve understood the rules of the loop how I’ve described them, you’ve probably reached the same conclusion I have about how I can break it.



There’s already a pretty obvious solution. 



Injuries retain. Position retains. I don’t want to spell it out.



It was a couple loops later where I was really thinking about it. Most of my time was spent rather mindlessly just watching videos. There was still so much left for me to see, and literally endless time with which to watch it. 



I honestly was somewhat impressed that each loop, just by refreshing my homepage and liking certain videos, I could watch entirely new tik toks every single day, and waste hours away without any issues.



Most of my time was spent asleep really. I averaged waking up around 4 to 5pm. It wasn’t like I was missing much in staying up.



But today I had woken up around noon. Remembering the thoughts that I had last night. 



I made myself my coffee, and I walked through my apartment complex. Towards the parking garage right next to it, walking up floor after floor. The time loop had of course started while the elevator was broken. Another small joy, though I hadn’t seen a reason to drive anywhere just yet.



I glanced at my car, and the bike hooked onto the back of it, but kept going up. To the top floor, the seventh.



The breeze was pretty nice, and the glittering skyline was open to me. I almost thought I could even see my college. Where my class had probably already started. The railing was bulky shoulder high concrete. I put my arm over top of it, resting them on it and staring out at the city. Then glancing lower down. 



The ground never feels far away until you look down and see it not right there for your feet to touch. 



If I leapt to meet it, I could probably end the loop. But so too would end everything.



Was that what I wanted? 



It’s frustrating. I can sip my sweet coffee while I think, which is nice. It’s frustrating that what I want is so unclear. Shouldn’t that be the most simplistic aspect of being something? Of being a person? A thing. 



Even in stories, motivation comes first. But what was I reaching for out there in the world? 



Nothing really. I didn’t have anything I wanted. I just was. Just am.



But did I want to stop being?



Not really.

""Terrance, are you crazy? You're really putting your own life on the line for Yasmine?""

""Back when Gianna's mom's surgery failed, you gave her kidney to Yasmine without even asking Gianna. Now, you're giving her GoldenAge's project, and you even broke your ribs trying to protect her. Do you even realize your broken ribs nearly pierced your heart?""

""Aren't you afraid Gianna will find out everything you've done for Yasmine behind her back and divorce you?""

When Gianna Henderson heard about her husband Terrance Henderson's car accident, she rushed to the hospital, only to hear someone yelling furiously inside the ward.

Gianna's mind went blank, her blood running cold in an instant.

A cold chill ran down her spine as she gripped the doorknob, frozen in place.

''Wait, Terrance gave my mom's kidney to Yasmine?' Gianna thought, her mind spinning. 'Terrance knew just how much I despised Yasmine.'

Terrance's voice came through the door, hoarse and weak. ""As long as Yasmine is safe, nothing else matters to me.

""You have no idea how sick I've felt having to be around Gianna all these years.

""Every time I think of how those debt collectors took turns with her, I just wanna throw up.

""If I weren't worried she'd go after Wyatt again after the divorce, I would've divorced her a long time ago.""

His tone was cold and indifferent, every word slamming into Gianna's heart like a hammer.

Back then, Gianna's father, Bruce Greene, set Gianna and her mother up and threw them out of the house. Her mother was gravely ill, and they were saddled with a crushing debt of 25 million dollars.

The debt collectors showed up and took Gianna away as collateral.

Gianna tried to call her fiancé, Wyatt Wheeler, for help, only to find out he dumped her and married Yasmine.

When things were at their worst, Terrance was the one who saved Gianna.

He paid off her debts and married her, never caring about the gossip swirling around them.

When Gianna's mother suddenly had a brain hemorrhage, Terrance called in top doctors right away for the surgery.

Even though her mother didn't survive, Gianna never stopped being grateful to Terrance.

Terrance had always been good to her over the years.

Everyone believed that Gianna had been sexually assaulted by those debt collectors.

But Terrance never cared about any of that. He still loved and cherished her.

He didn't want her to feel ashamed, so he chose not to hold a wedding at all.

Worried she'd be haunted by emotional scars, he kept his distance, never having sex with her.

For the longest time, Gianna believed Terrance was her salvation.

But now, she finally understood that everything he'd done was for Yasmine, not her.

Gianna's face went ghostly pale. She couldn't bear to stay another second and bolted from the hospital.

She stumbled back to their marital home with Terrance, her mind numb and empty.

Every corner of this place was packed with memories of her and Terrance.

The wall art they picked out together, the fresh flowers Terrance gave her on the coffee table, and the matching slippers by the door...

All of them used to mean happiness and love to Gianna.

But now, every little thing felt like a stinging slap to her face.

They were mocking her for how naive she'd been.

Gianna curled up on the couch, crying until she had no tears left. Then started sobbing all over again.

After a long, silent night, the quiet of the villa was finally broken by the sound of the front door unlocking.

Terrance pushed the door open and stepped inside.

When he saw Gianna sitting on the couch, he froze for a second, then hurried over to her.

His good looks were clouded with concern. He asked, ""Gigi, why are your eyes so swollen? Have you been crying? Is it because I didn't come back for your birthday?

""I'm really sorry. Something came up out of nowhere yesterday. I just couldn't get back in time. I swear, it won't happen again.

""Look, this is your birthday present. Tomorrow, let me make it up to you, okay?""

He took out an elegant blue velvet box and popped it open. Inside was an extravagant pink diamond necklace sparkling under the light.

It suddenly hit Gianna that yesterday was her birthday.

She'd been looking forward to Terrance coming home so they could celebrate together, but instead, the only thing she got was a call from the hospital. They told her Terrance had a car accident.

She'd rushed over, only to overhear that cruel conversation.

Gianna's heart clenched, and tears began to fall once more.

Terrance gently wiped her tears away without hesitation.

""Don't cry, honey. I'm really sorry. Let me help you put it on, alright?"" he said softly.

Terrance took out the necklace, moved behind Gianna, and gently fastened it around her neck.

But as Gianna replayed those words she'd overheard at the hospital and saw Terrance putting on that affectionate act, her stomach turned.

She couldn't hold it back anymore. She clapped a hand over her mouth and threw up right there.

Terrance froze, worry etched all over his face as he rushed to rub her back. ""Gigi, what's wrong? Are you feeling sick? I'm so sorry. I really should've come back earlier.""

Gianna tried to pull away from his touch, but the moment she moved, her stomach twisted even worse.

""I'm taking you to the hospital right now,"" Terrance said, his voice urgent.

Without another word, he bent down and scooped Gianna up into his arms.

Gianna still felt nauseous, but she managed to hold it together and didn't throw up again.

She glanced at Terrance, and his handsome face was etched with heartfelt worry.

If this had been before, her eyes would've been brimming with tears.

But now, all she felt was a coldness that cut straight to her bones.

''He despises me so much, yet he can act like he really cares about me. His facade is downright scary,' Gianna thought.

Terrance stormed into the hospital and yelled for help, with Gianna cradled in his arms.

He was so frantic that people would think Gianna was at death's door.

During the examination, Terrance never left her side, holding her hand tight and comforting, ""Gigi, relax. I'm right here. You'll be alright.""

Gianna stayed silent, not saying a word.

She just couldn't connect the caring guy in front of her, the one acting like she was his whole world, with that cold-hearted man who said he would've dumped her long ago if he weren't afraid she'd go after Wyatt and mess up Yasmine's life.

''He's such a fake,' Gianna thought, her heart sinking.

Terrance could tell Gianna was weirdly quiet, but he figured she was just giving him the cold shoulder because he missed her birthday. He just brushed it off and didn't think much of it.

After the check-up, Terrance stayed by Gianna's side on the hallway bench, waiting for the results.

""Gigi, are you feeling any better? Want some water?"" Terrance asked.

He glanced at Gianna's ghostly pale face, concern etched deep in his eyes.

After puking, Gianna still had that nasty taste lingering in her mouth. She really needed some water to wash it away.

Just as she was about to nod, Terrance's phone started ringing out of nowhere.

He glanced at the caller ID, and a strange look flashed in his eyes.

""Gigi, I need to take this call,"" he said.

With that, he got up and stepped aside to answer.

Gianna kept her eyes down, her fingers clenched tightly in her palm.

She saw the caller ID when Terrance pulled out his phone—it was Yasmine.

Terrance deliberately stepped away, making sure Gianna couldn't hear a single word Yasmine was saying.

Terrance's face suddenly turned anxious, and Gianna was sure Yasmine had said something that made him worry.

Gianna thought wryly, 'Honestly, as long as it's about Yasmine, Terrance will always get worked up, no matter what it is.'

Soon, Terrance came back from his call, looking apologetic and uneasy. ""I'm really sorry, Gigi. There's an emergency at work. I need to head back right away.

""Will you be okay by yourself? I promise, as soon as I handle things, I'll come straight back to you.""

Gianna shot him a long, searching look.

Suddenly, she remembered that so many times before, Terrance had used the same excuse, saying there was some emergency at work and he had to rush out.

''Was it ever really about work, or was it always Yasmine calling him away?' she wondered.

Yet she didn't dare let herself keep thinking. The more she thought about it, the more heartbroken she felt.

Terrance got a little nervous under her stare, and he subconsciously pursed his lips.

Just as he was about to say something, Gianna casually replied, ""Go ahead. Don't worry about me. I'm fine.""

Chapter 2 Terrrance's Two Roles

Gianna thought it was good without him around. She had something she wanted to check out anyway. If he were still here, it would just get in the way.

""Thanks, Gigi. Marrying you is honestly the best thing that ever happened to me,"" Terrance smiled.

He didn't pick up on the change in her tone, just gave her a half-hearted compliment, and leaned in to kiss her forehead.

Gianna turned her head away, dodging his kiss.

Terrance paused for a second, but didn't think much of it. He just figured she was still sulking.

""Gigi, once you get the report, snap a pic and send it to me right away, okay? Don't make me worry,"" Terrance said, giving her head a quick rub before hurrying off.

As soon as he was gone, Gianna scrubbed at the spot he'd touched, unable to hold back another wave of disgust.

Forcing herself to push through the nausea, she made her way to the hospital records room, claiming to be a family member so she could get her hands on the consent form her mother had signed for the kidney donation.

The records room was overflowing with files, making it a real challenge to find what she was looking for.

Luckily, Gianna still remembered the exact date of her mom's surgery. The clerk dug through the files from that year and quickly found the consent form.

Gianna's hands shook as she took the organ donation agreement. When she spotted Terrance's name written in the section for the donor's family, it was like her whole world came crashing down.

She staggered, her face turning as white as a sheet, startling the clerk.

""Are you alright, ma'am?"" the clerk asked with concern, quickly reaching out to steady her and help her sit down.

Gianna waved her hand, trying to assure them she was okay.

But when she tried to speak, all that came out was a painful rasp from her throat.

Gianna felt like someone had carved a hole right through her heart.

The icy wind rushed in, shredding her heart into bloody, aching pieces.

''I was so stupid. How could I have been so blind?' she berated herself inwardly.

Terrance had given her mother's kidney to the daughter of the woman who killed her mother, and all these years, she'd been living in the dark, married to him, clueless about the truth.

She'd even leaned on him for everything—her savior, her hero, the only one she ever relied on.

Right then and there, Gianna decided she would divorce Terrance.

She grabbed her phone and called a number she knew by heart. ""I accept your offer. I'll join you in two weeks.""

Two weeks was plenty of time for her to end things with Terrance.

Gianna wandered out of the records room, still in a daze. As she was about to leave the hospital, she bumped into two nurses.

""Oh my, is that woman in the VIP suite Mr. Henderson's wife? She's absolutely stunning. She and Mr. Henderson look amazing together. And he's totally head over heels for her, just like everyone says,"" one nurse gushed.

""Yeah. I heard they got into a car accident, and Mr. Henderson nearly died trying to protect her. Even with those serious injuries, he wouldn't stay in bed. He rushed straight to her room to look after her. I'm so touched,"" the other nurse chimed in.

""Ugh, same people, different fates. Why is my luck so bad? Why can't I get a guy like that?"" the first nurse sighed.

""Forget it, girl. Did you see that pink diamond ring on Mrs. Henderson's finger? Seven carats! Mr. Henderson dropped 30 million at an auction just to get it for her,"" the second nurse said.

The nurses's gossip drilled into Gianna's ears like venom-tipped needles, each one stabbing straight into her heart.

Her heart felt like it was bleeding out. The agony made her wish she were dead.

Turned out that while she was kept in the dark, Terrance had been bending over backwards for Yasmine all along.

Gianna stared at the ring on her right ring finger, the one Terrance had slipped on when he proposed to her.

It was too loose, always sliding around on her delicate finger, never quite fitting.

But since they never had a wedding, Terrance seemed to forget about getting her a proper wedding ring.

''If he really cared about me, how could he forget something so important?' Gianna thought bitterly. 'Of course, the real wedding ring was meant for someone else.'

Gianna clutched her chest, feeling like her heart was about to shatter into pieces.

Inside the ward, Terrance tried to sound tough. ""You know you're injured, and it's hard for you to get around, but you still insist on doing everything yourself. What if you fall again? Do you want to end up crippled?

""Where the hell is Wyatt? You got into a car accident and ended up in the hospital, but he can't even bother to show up? Does that even make sense?""

Terrance frowned, ""Just tell me straight. Is Wyatt ignoring your feelings?""

Yasmine smiled, trying to reassure him, ""Terry, Wyatt's really good to me. He was overseas for work, but the moment he heard about my accident, he wanted to fly back right away.

""I told him I was fine and said he should finish up his business before coming back.

""You know how much GoldenAge's project means to him. If he can land it, life will get a whole lot easier for both of us in the Wheeler family.""

Terrance immediately replied, ""Didn't I tell you I'll get you the project?""

Gianna's heart hit rock bottom upon hearing that.

She had led her team through more than a month of sweat and tears just to win GoldenAge Enterprise's project.

Terrance just decided to give it to Yasmine without a second thought for her team, not giving a damn about all the effort they'd poured into it.

""Forget it. If Gigi finds out we've been keeping in touch and you're giving me the project, she'll totally get pissed,"" Yasmine said, shooting a subtle glance at the doorway.

""If it ends up causing a fight between you two, I'd honestly feel so guilty,"" she added.

Terrance shot back, ""Why does it matter if she gets pissed? You're always stressing over everything. Why don't you put more energy into yourself for once?

""Gianna's already been kicked out by his father, and her mother is gone. If she tries to stand up to me, she's got nowhere left to stay. So don't sweat it. She won't be against it.""

Yasmine started to say something else, her voice hesitant. ""But...""

Terrance cut her off. ""Forget about those people. They don't matter.

""Does your stomach still hurt? I'll go get a nurse to bring you a fresh hot water bottle.""

Without waiting for her reply, he grabbed the still-warm hot water bottle from her stomach and headed out to find a nurse.

As he walked out, Terrance pulled out his phone and shot a message to Gigi.

Terrance: \[Gigi, did the test results come in yet? Let me know as soon as you hear anything, okay? Don't keep me in suspense.\]

Hearing footsteps approaching, Gianna instinctively darted into the nearest corner.

She was so numb from heartbreak that even the tears had run dry; all that was left inside her was a cold, hollow emptiness.

Gianna thought bitterly, 'So Terrance knew everything all along.

''He knew I had nowhere else to turn, and that he was the only one I could rely on, so he was convinced I would never walk away.

''That was why he could lie, hurt, and betray me so shamelessly, without a trace of remorse.'

Her phone buzzed in her pocket. Gianna pulled it out and saw a message from Terrance.

She looked up, watching Terrance's back as he headed toward the nurse's station, her eyes filled with disbelief and bitter sarcasm.

''How does he manage to switch between those two roles so effortlessly?' Gianna scoffed inwardly.

He could fuss over his lover, all sweet and caring, while putting on a show of devotion for his wife, who was nothing but a burden to him.

""You saw it all, didn't you?"" Yasmine's voice rang out, taunting and smug.

Gianna looked up and met her triumphant gaze.

""Whether it's Dad, Wyatt, or Terrance, the one they all love is me,"" Yasmine declared, her voice dripping with arrogance.

""And you? You're just the one they tossed aside like trash,"" she sneered.

Yasmine lifted her hand, showing off the huge pink diamond ring on her finger.

The diamond was plump and brilliant, sparkling beautifully under the lights.

""See this? Terry bought this diamond just for me, and he personally designed and had this ring cut and made,"" Yasmine gloated.

""And that necklace around your neck? It's just the leftover bits from the diamond Terry used for my ring,"" she sneered.

Yasmine's eyes were dripping with sarcasm, each glance like a needle driving deep into Gianna's chest.

Her humiliation of being scorned, dismissed, and suffocated for being the illegitimate child was finally released.

Yasmine watched Gianna with smug satisfaction, almost as if she were eagerly waiting for Gianna to completely lose control.

Chapter 3 I Quit

Yasmine thought, 'So what if she acts all high and mighty, pretending to be the socialite role model? She still can't beat me at anything. All she can do is pick up the scraps I leave behind.'

Gianna looked at Yasmine's face, which was a spitting image of her homewrecker mother, and couldn't help but remember how that woman had ruined their happy life, flaunting her victory in front of her mother.

It was they who drove her mother into depression and even took her mother's kidney.

Just thinking about her mother's kidney now being inside Yasmine made Gianna want to grab a knife and cut her open to take it back.

However, her reason held her back, forcing her to keep it together.

''No, not now. At least, not yet,' she told herself.

''Losing it won't fix anything. I'm not here to crash and perish with the two bastards. I'm going to make them pay, every last bit,' Gianna thought.

She took a deep breath and clenched her fists.

She lifted her gaze, eyes dripping with sarcasm as she stared at Yasmine's smug face. ""Figures, trashy blood really does get passed down. Your mother was nothing but a homewrecker.

""And you? Snatching one wasn't enough for you, huh? Had to go for seconds. What, are you that desperate for men?""

Gianna's pale face was nothing but sarcasm and ridicule.

Every word she said was laced with poison, hitting Yasmine right where it hurt the most.

What Yasmine hated most was people calling her mother a homewrecker and calling her an illegitimate child who should never have existed.

Yasmine was shaking with rage. ""Gianna, say that again. I dare you!""

Gianna shot her a sideways glance, her presence overwhelming. ""Sure. You're nothing but a shameless illegitimate brat, a homewrecker who snatches my fiancé and wrecks my marriage.""

""Ah..."" Yasmine snapped and reached out to slap Gianna.

Gianna surely wouldn't just stand there and take it. She instinctively raised her arm to block.

But before Yasmine's hand could even touch Gianna, Yasmine suddenly fell back, her head slamming into the wall with a heavy thud.

""Minnie!"" A worried voice called out from behind Gianna.

Gianna was just about to turn around when, out of nowhere, a powerful force slammed into her, sending her flying and knocking over a nearby medical waste bin.

Her hand landed right in a pile of shattered glass, and blood started pouring out instantly.

Terrance acted like Gianna didn't even exist. He rushed to help Yasmine, his face full of worry. ""Are you okay? Did you get hurt?""

Yasmine's face was pale, but she shook her head, looking fragile and determined.

""I'm fine,"" she said, looking at Gianna with red eyes.

Forcing back tears, she said, ""Gigi, I just wanted to clear up the misunderstanding from back then. I didn't mean anything by it. Why did you push me?""

""Gianna!"" Terrance whipped around, staring at Gianna. ""Yasmine was just trying to clear things up with you. Even if you didn't want to listen, you can't push her.

""Say you're sorry. Right now.""

Even though Gianna already knew Terrance only cared about Yasmine, seeing him take her side so obviously still cut Gianna to the core.

After all those years together, there wasn't even a shred of trust left for her.

He didn't bother to ask and just pinned it all on her without a second thought.

Gianna closed her eyes, sneering, ""Apologize? For what? Why should I apologize to her?""

She forced herself up from the floor, watching Yasmine play the helpless victim, snuggling up to Terrance. The sarcasm in Gianna's gaze was practically dripping.

Gianna scoffed, ""You say you want to explain some misunderstanding? What are you gonna say?

""Was it when you crawled into Wyatt's bed and tried to seduce him? Or was it when you stole my mother's...""

Gianna hadn't even finished speaking when a stinging slap landed, cutting her off.

She covered her cheek, staring in shock and disbelief at the person who'd just hit her.

Terrance paused, frustration flickering across his face as his hand clenched tightly.

Terrance tried to explain, ""Gigi, I didn't mean to...""

But Gianna just shot him a look that cut right through him, then ripped the necklace he'd just given her and hurled it straight at his face.

""You gave me the crap she doesn't want to disgust me, huh? Terrance, I don't give it a damn,"" Gianna sneered.

With that, she spun around and strode off without a second glance.

Terrance started to go after her, but Yasmine suddenly grabbed his arm. ""Terry, my head hurts so much. I feel so dizzy.""

Terrance immediately forgot about everything else and focused on Yasmine. He quickly scooped her up and carried her back to her room.

Yasmine nestled in his arms and watched Gianna walk away, her eyes cold and calculating.

Yasmine wondered, 'What was Gianna about to say earlier? What did she know? Does she actually know about the surgery?'

Gianna left the hospital, ready to hail a cab and head back to the villa to pack up her things.

She was done with Terrance. She was getting a divorce and moving out of the house they once called home.

The moment she walked in, Terrance rushed over and grabbed her by the shoulders.

""Gigi, where have you been? What took you so long to get back?"" Terrance blurted out. ""I called you a bunch of times, and you never answered. Do you even know how freaked out I was?""

Gianna winced at the pain from his grip, her brows knitting together as she pried his hands off. ""It's none of your concern.""

She walked right past him, heading upstairs to pack her things.

As Gianna brushed past Terrance, she was caught off guard to find Yasmine standing there too.

Gianna's face went stone cold in an instant.

""Gigi..."" Terrance saw her face darken and tried to say something, wanting to explain himself.

But before he could finish, Yasmine jumped in. ""Terry, see? You worry too much. I told you she'd be fine.

""She was probably just giving us the silent treatment because of what happened at the hospital.

""But Gigi, Terry only acted out because he was so worried about me. Please, don't take it to heart.

""I already explained to Terry. I was just slipping. You didn't push me.

""Come on, Gigi, don't make a fuss with Terry. There's really nothing going on between us.""

She spoke in that pitiful voice, pretending she was just worried about Gianna and Terrance, acting like she didn't want to be the reason they fought.

But actually, she was just rubbing it in Gianna's face.

She was showing off how Terrance was totally wrapped around her finger, always jumping to do whatever she wanted.

Gianna felt nothing but disgust. She gave Yasmine a frosty stare. ""We both know the truth, don't we?

""Drop the act, Yasmine. Whatever happens between you and him has nothing to do with me.""

Gianna's voice was cold and sharp, leaving no room for argument.

Her attitude hit so hard that Terrance suddenly felt a chill run down his spine, like everything was starting to spiral out of his control.

Seeing Gianna about to walk away, Terrance grabbed her arm in a hurry. ""Seriously, there's nothing between me and Yasmine. I only take care of her because she's your sister, that's all.

""You don't have to move out just to prove a point. Let's just let it go, alright? I'm not going to hold it against you or make you apologize to Yasmine.

""But to make it up to you, I'm letting Minnie take charge of GoldenAge's project.""

""On what grounds?"" Gianna shot Terrance a frosty glare. ""My team and I pulled more than a dozen all-nighters, grinding away for over a month just to win GoldenAge's project.

""What makes you think you can just hand it over to her easily?""

Terrance's brows furrowed at her response.

He thought he'd been more than generous—cutting her some slack, not making her apologize, just handing her an easy way out. He figured she'd play along and let him smooth things over.

He'd already set it up for her to take the easy route, but she just refused to go along with it.

Terrance was starting to lose his cool. He snapped, ""I'm your boss. It's my call who gets the project.

""If you've got a problem with that, I can just take you off everything.""

Gianna snorted, her gaze dripping with sarcasm as she stared at Terrance.

She'd busted her ass for him, doing everything she could to help him get a foothold at Henderson Group, including making plans, closing deals, and always having his back.

And now, just because she wouldn't hand over the project she'd poured her heart and soul into to Yasmine, he wanted to kick her out.

Gianna shot him a disappointed look, her anger simmering just beneath the surface.

She spoke through gritted teeth, ""Save yourself the trouble. I quit.""

Chapter 4 No Turning Back

Terrance was furious that his voice came out through clenched teeth. ""Gianna!""

He couldn't believe Gianna would repeatedly defy his orders.

""Terrance, I'm not stupid. If you pay attention, the truth isn't hard to spot,"" Gianna said with a mocking smile. ""You are not worth trusting from the start.""

Terrance frowned, thinking, 'What the hell is up with Gianna today? She's acting so out of character and even ignoring everything I say.'

Seeing the situation heading south, Yasmine quickly hatched a plan. She spoke up in a hesitant voice, ""Terry, if Gigi doesn't want to give me the project, it's okay. I really don't want to make things difficult for her.

""Besides, it seems like this project is super important to Gigi. I'm totally fine with that.""

Yasmine tugged gently at Terrance's sleeve, her delicate face looking up at him with a pitiful, almost tearful expression.

1pphy5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/meateatertv/comments/1pphy5r/would_you_subscribe_to_a_meateater_magazine/,Would you subscribe to a MeatEater Magazine?,"I have an idea for the MeatEater crew. I have always thought that they should have a printed magazine. I’m not sure if this would be profitable for them or not. I tend to think it could be. I understand everything has went digital but I miss the days of checking my mailbox and finding new issue of a magazine I had subscribed to. Or having a hard copy of the last three months on the coffee table. Magazine subscriptions also make great gifts.  

The post about MeatEater pay for content recently caused a ruckus. Truth is a company like this has to make a profit. They employ upwards of 100+ across their brands, they have been putting out free content for years. I don’t mind the ads in podcast and such, I like the MeatEater personalities and I want them to get paid. Maybe a magazine could add to their profits, or not. Let me hear your thoughts.

I graduated in June 2025 at Rotman U of T, and over 8 month of full time experience, did decently well with school, after graduating in finance/Economics and have gotten one interview at one of the big 5 through an internal referral. And almost any Big firms had 0 interviews 0 contact, just constant rejections every single day.

I would say I almost did everything I can, except I didn't do grad school nor did CFA level1/CSC. I genuiely have no idea what I could do to possibly get better, I am an international student, and I don't have so many local network, even though I coffee chat/ cold calls/emails and tried to network a lot, just not getting anything back. I just want to have a positions that pays decent and my more than satisfied, and just getting a position is much more important to me than monetary benefits.

Every single position has hundreds of applicants and I’ve been consistently rejected every week although I’m an M&A analyst at my position right now. But I felt like I will get laid off and just planning to get a better job.

What can I do more? I sincerely want some advice.

1pphu4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pphu4j/sf_six_driveins_and_a_yorkie/,[SF] Six Drive-Ins and a Yorkie,"Colt had been trying to keep things low-key ever since the Easter incident, when he’d accidentally referred to the resurrected Christ as a “zombie with a purpose” during a youth sermon. But this Sunday, as he sipped his third cup of church-lobby coffee and tried to dodge a second conversation about the volleyball league’s no-dunking policy, the older boys from the youth group cornered him.

“Yo, Brother Colt,” said Jaden, wearing a sleeveless hoodie that read HOLY GAINS. “We’re doing a Turbo Tots crawl today. You in?”

Colt blinked. “What’s… a Turbo Tots crawl?”

“You don’t know what a Turbo Tots crawl is? That’s a crazy L to take. One meal, six courses, at six different Turbo Tots drive-ins. We got it mapped: drinks, apps, chicken, burgers, mystery round, dessert. It’s like a pub crawl, but with tater tots.”

“Also it’s a ministry opportunity,” added Tyler, whose only spiritual gift was speed-eating footlong chili dogs.

Colt scratched his chin. He was technically off the clock, but this might, on paper, qualify as discipleship.

“I’m driving,” Colt said, immediately regretting it.

Turbo Tots 1: Drinks.
Easy. Everyone got their signature beverage. Colt, trying to impress the boys, ordered a Blue Puddle with extra coconut and lime. It tasted like suntan lotion and regret.

Turbo Tots 2: Appetizers.
Jalapeño poppers, mozzarella sticks, and those weird pickle fries that taste like they were left behind by a traveling carnival. Tyler claimed he once baptized a guy in cherry limeade.

Turbo Tots 3: Chicken.
Things got messy. Jaden threw ranch packets at Brayden, who retaliated by snorting crushed ice and had a brain freeze so paralyzing that he could not defend against being farted on. Colt tried to give a devotion about the loaves and fishes but was interrupted when unintentionally hit in the face by a flying chicken tender.

Turbo Tots 4: Burgers.
Everyone got quiet. There was something sanctifying about eating a greasy double cheeseburger on the side of a regional highway while TobyMac played softly through a Bluetooth speaker.

Then came the fifth Turbo Tots stop of the afternoon. The mystery round. The mistake.

This location had been chosen solely for its convenience on the route to Turbo Tots 6, but there was no parking lot. Just a sign:

PARKING TEMPORARILY LOCATED IN PERSEPOLIS COUNTY PARKING GARAGE #4

“That doesn’t even make sense,” Colt muttered, shaking off his tetraphobia. “But signs don’t lie.”

Persepolis County Garage #4 was dim, low-ceilinged, and deeply un-Turbo Tots-like.

“Maybe it’s like… an urban Turbo Tots?” Jaden offered.
“What is an urban Turbo Tots?” Colt asked.

No one knew, that’s crazy. But they parked anyway.

They walked to Turbo Tots 5 for the mystery round: everyone ordered something blind and swapped through. Colt unwrapped a Frito chili pie burrito wrapped in tinfoil and bad decisions.

Back at the garage, bellies full of deep-fried ambiguity, Colt hit the key fob.

Become a member
Nothing.

“Dude,” Brayden whispered. “Your car’s gone.”

Colt stared. It was still there; just one level down, nose-deep in a fresh, cartoonishly perfect hole in the concrete.

“Oh no,” Colt said softly. “This is exactly how my cousin’s wedding ended.”

A construction crew swarmed like ants.

“Not our fault,” said a guy in a hard hat labeled #1 Pawpaw. “Garage was built during the Carter administration. She was bound to give.”

Then Colt’s First Sergeant from his National Guard unit showed up, in the capacity of a County Sheriff’s Deputy. No one had called him.

“We’re doing a barbecue. Come by. Bring the youthlings.”

Colt asked how he was barbequing while clearly on duty. The First Sergeant did not answer.

This is how they ended up at a three-bedroom ranch conveniently next to Garage #4. The air smelled like mesquite and mild theological tension.

The First Sergeant’s wife, wearing a rhinestone hair claw and a turquoise cross necklace large enough to require a seatbelt, appeared holding a basket of teacup Yorkies.

“Pick one,” she said brightly. “They need Godly homes.”

Colt picked the one with an underbite and a limp. He named it Tribulation.

Tribulation wandered off during the cornhole tournament and was found yapping at a chain-link fence. The neighbor turned out to be Colt’s cousin Nathan, who wore cargo shorts for all of life’s occasions.

“Come see what I’m growing,” Nathan said, without otherwise acknowledging Colt or his teenaged crew.

In the greenhouse, Colt and the church bros saw vines drooping under the weight of tomatoes the size of pumpkins.

Colt reached toward one.
It pulled back.

The skin glowed. Veins of gold pulsed beneath the surface, like lightning trapped in fruit.

“They’re almost ready,” Nathan said.
“Ready for what?” Colt asked.

“For when the ground splits and the sky doesn’t answer. You’ll need seed then. Not noise. Not fear. Seed.”

Before Colt could reply, the tomato cracked open. Blinding, alive, humming.

Everything stopped. The mosquitoes. The wind. The Earth.

Only Tribulation moved, tail wagging like he’d passed a test he didn’t know he was taking.

“Did it just… sing?” Colt asked.
“I wouldn’t call it singing,” Nathan said. “More like… agricultural prophecy.”

Colt gently closed the tomato’s cracked skin like a book he wasn’t ready to read.

“Bro,” Jaden whispered, “we just found the fruit of the Spirit.”
Brayden crossed himself, which made no theological sense, but Colt let it slide.

“Do you have more of these?” Colt asked.

Nathan didn’t answer. He opened a chest freezer in the corner of the greenhouse. Inside, nestled between two frozen lasagnas and what looked like a raccoon skull wrapped in butcher paper, were six vacuum-sealed tomato slices, each glowing faintly.

“Emergency seed.”

Tyler, still sucking on the last of his dessert slush, nodded.

“Respect.”

Suddenly, the First Sergeant shouted: “Time for spiritual charades!”

The Yorkies were dressed as the Twelve Minor Prophets. Colt’s was given a tiny name tag: NAHUM. He decided to go with it.

----------------------------------------------------------------

That night, Colt sat on a porch swing with Tribulation… or Nahum… on his lap, watching the stars, fiddling with a complimentary I Brake for Tots! bumper sticker for a car he no longer had, and wondering if his insurance covered artificial sinkholes.

Somewhere in the distance, the tomatoes hummed again.",1,1766032351.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1pphtkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1pphtkn/the_cold_war_accountant/,The Cold War Accountant,"My grandfather was a thin, serious man who worked as an accountant and traveled constantly for audits. He was kind and honest. He gave extra tight hugs that he called Bear Hugs. He logged every detail of his life after retirement. If it was a trip to the gas station he would write how much gas was per gallon, how much he purchased, and which tires he inflated with how much air.

Before he was an accountant, he was in the military. He enlisted in the Air Force specifically to avoid being drafted into the Army or Marines during Korea. He grew up in a poor mining family and was terrified of water because couldn’t swim; otherwise he probably would’ve joined the Navy.  Plus the Air Force was new then and he loved planes. 

In his last few years, he started telling us strange and intriguing short stories. This was well over a decade before the movie The Accountant with Ben Affleck, so no one thought that the job title of accountant, sounded cool. I thought it sounded like a nightmare. I hated math. But his stories started spicing up.

We’d be watching a spy show or fighter jet on TV and he’d casually say “After I got out of the Air Force, that’s a lot of what I used to do.” And we’d say “What a spy?” “What a pilot?” He’d give ha solemn “Yup”

We laughed it off. My grandfather had terrible dementia in those final years. He couldn’t remember where he left his newspaper when it was within arms reach. We all knew these brief stories were just imaginary confusion. Plus it was fun to hear so we never pressed him for evidence of these tall tales. 

But then the stories got detailed. His long “auditing projects” were more than numbers.

He started explaining how he learned to fly, how he flew reconnaissance and interception missions out of Greenland, and how they “chased the Russians back almost daily.”

Still funny, still harmless, and wholesome family joke territory.  

Then one morning over coffee, he dropped the big one.

“On one of my ‘accounting audit’ trips, I shot down a Soviet plane over Greenland in December of 1963. The Soviets covered it up out of embarrassment, and blamed it on ice in Moscow. Like they don’t understand ice in Russia. We helped cover it up to prevent a war.”

We were barely holding it together at this point. We had to ask- “Oh yea, what happened after that?”

Then he continued, completely straight-faced holding his coffee mug in one hand and news paper folded in the other.

“I snuck into Russia a week later to attend one of the pilots’ funerals in Moscow. I only said a few words in Russian to his widow. ‘Please accept my condolences.’ And she looked at me in a way that made me think that somehow she knew what had happened and who I was.”

He went so far as to tell this story to a Naval pilot at an air show. The man thanked him for his service and seemed genuinely impressed. 

That story became legendary in our family. We referenced it constantly. Any time a fighter jet flew over, or a Cold War documentary was on tv, or our annual James Bond Christmas marathon, we were all instantly cracking jokes “Look it’s Pop!” He would laugh nodding slowly and say “I know! Hard to believe it!” 

Years later, at his funeral, we’re standing graveside as his casket was being lowered. Everyone’s crying. It’s quiet. Heavy.

And then a black SUV slowly pulls up near us in the cemetery.

Without thinking, I blurt out in a monotone voice “We’re all gonna feel pretty silly if an old Russian lady gets out of that car.”

There was a pause and then, one by one, sniffles turned to chuckles. Suddenly our entire family was laughing through tears as my grandfather was laid to rest like the mysterious Cold War legend he claimed to be.",3,1766032300.0,stories,1,1.0,False

OK, great picks no doubt, but that's seven guys. We're still 243 short. Not counting open mic dilettantes, is 250 not a decent estimation of the amount of real comics out there?

1pphqrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackgirls/comments/1pphqrg/dating_is_strange/,Dating is strange.,"as a 23 year old black young woman, I finally believe my mind is maturing, and I’m beginning to realize a lot of things about myself that the younger versions of me would not have been able to accept. which has been a very insightfully yet bittersweet experience so far. 

Recently, I have been simply yearning for relationship that seems to be close but far away im my future. I feel like in due time it will come my way, but I’m really fighting the urge to force it, despite me already, knowing that it won’t be good for my mental health or my self image. I went out of town  for some time, and decided to get back on the apps to see what else is out there outside of my big but, small town. I quickly became pissed off with the process; people saying “hey baby” or just “hey” with very shallow compliments or remarks simply pissed me off and quickly convinced me to delete the apps shortly after downloading them. My friends were quite astonished by my resolve, as in the past i would entertain the people i matched with in the hopes of finding “the one”.  it didn’t take a lot for me to decipher the bullshit that was coming for me this time and immediately delete the apps. I realized that the parasocial relationships dating apps give us no longer has a purpose in my life. And it seems like God doesn’t intend for me to find my partner like that seeing that I’m so opposed to the idea of it that it makes my head hurt lol. I’m starting to realize that I want something real. I no longer crave the sparks immediately flying and the instant attraction, I no longer crave the butterflies and racing heart and blinding love.  I want something long-lasting, slow, warm, gentle and comforting. Like a good slow burn book. 

It hasn’t been helping I’ve been reading a lot of slow romance novels and comics that focus on the small actions. It’s nurturing the idea of having something slow, steady, and wholesome. Like bumping into an old classmate and starting a friendship, or randomly chatting with someone I met at a coffee shop or at a grocery store. Leading to us touching elbows when walking, genuine interest in what we say and why, the sensuality of caring for others and who they are, and actually asking someone out on a date that ends at a decent time at night in us both going our separate ways and reminiscing on the date we had. What I want is something that our current culture doesn’t push, and at times I feel like I’ll never have that moment because most people are on apps or value social media. I’d love to find my person without the use of that.

I’m also realizing that sex is something extremely sacred to me.  I no longer feel comfortable with the idea of flings, hook ups, or any relationship that evolves or has a foundation around the transaction of sexual favors. I want that to be the last thing that happens between me and whoever I end up with. growing up I was obsessed with a fantasy of what love and relationship relationships are supposed to look like, thinking that relationships are supposed to be easy and filled of butterflies and laughter. But I’m starting to realize and except that relationships are a lot more complex than that. it’s definitely taking a while for me to realize that, but I’m very glad that I have. Anyone else have this realization?

Since ZMF take 6-8 week to test and ship them, I don't yet have possession of this set (hence my ""weird post"" comment). However, this offers the opportunity to do a transfer of sale to a new original owner. A friendly AVExchange user showed me how ZMF, in the past,  have done this for their customers: [https://www.head-fi.org/classifieds/zmf-verite-open-transfer-sale-to-new-owner.9244/](https://www.head-fi.org/classifieds/zmf-verite-open-transfer-sale-to-new-owner.9244/)

If we do this trade now (i.e. before I have possession), I will work with you + ZMF Support to do the ownership transfer. The original owner card would have your name.

If we do this trade after I receive the headphones, I will ship you the set as received. The owner's card would have my name.

Either way - you pay what I originally paid - **$2,899.99.**

On the flip side, I’m not into alcohol, smoking, or bad drivers. I also stay away from politics (too much drama for me), and I’m not a fan of country music or reality TV shows. As for me personally, I’m married with kids, so I’m just looking for a cool friend to chat with, nothing romantic.

Aria's POV

I stood in front of the chapel.

Pink roses and white lilies decorated every corner. My favorite flowers.

The guests were already seated. Soon, at the end of the red carpet would stand the man I once loved, waiting to marry his bride.

Everything was perfect.

Except I wasn't the bride.

“I really need to see Jace today.”

I begged the bodyguard blocking the door. A beat-up suitcase and two boxes sat at my feet. Everything I owned in the world.

""No you don’t. Get out of here,"" the bodyguard said icily.

I saw disgust in his eyes. Yeah I get it. No one has sympathy for the crazy ex who shows up at the wedding.

But I have my reason to be here.

""If you don't let me see him, I'll just stand here and all the guests will see me,"" I threatened under my breath.

Jace wouldn't want that. Especially not today.

Because today, he was marrying Delilah Hart.

She is the sister to Alpha Grayson Hart of Redstone Pack. A 100% high-society darling.

All the guys in the world knew that marrying Delilah would totally change their lives, including Jace.

So he made the easy call—marrying the lady who could turn him from a small-town nobody into a golden boy. And dump the girl who stayed by his side for last 4 years when he had nothing.

He didn’t want any guests to see me here. Because I represented his broke, embarrassing past. He wanted me nowhere near his glittering new world.

Tears stung my eyes as I thought of that. Like a knife was twisting in my chest.

“Let me in or I’m starting to yell.” I choked.

The bodyguard frowned. ""Wait here.""

He finally called somebody. A few minutes later, he waved me in.

I wiped my eyes and struggled into the hall with my suitcase and boxes.

Instantly, I felt out of place.

Everything reeked of wealth here. Expensive perfume. Manicured nails. Not a hair out of place. It was everything you imagined about the upper-class and way more.

And me?

I was wearing a baggy T-shirt and jeans. My sneakers had holes.

""God, a homeless. She stinks."" A woman mutter as I walked by.

No it couldn’t be. I just showered this morning. My hair still smelled like strawberries and coconut.

But poverty had a scent, apparently.

""Mr. Carter is inside."" The guard took me to a closed door and warned, “Make it quick.”

“Thank you.”

The room inside looked like something out of a movie. Marble floors. White carpet. A chandelier that probably cost more than my apartment.

And there he was.

The man I used to love.

Adjusting his bowtie in front of a mirror.

Jace was still heartbreakingly handsome. No wonder Delilah fell for him.

When he turned and fixed his gorgeous blue eyes upon me, I still felt my heart race.

""Hey, Jace,"" I said quietly.

And immediately, I wanted to punch myself.

Hey, Jace?!

That’s the best I could do?

His face was ice cold.

""You shouldn't come, Aria.” he said with a frown. “Your ratty suitcase, your ripped jeans, your Vans. None of that belongs here.""

Well if you wanted to be brutal and vicious, that’s how it’s done.

""Don’t you think I deserve an explanation? You dumped me over a fucking email!"" I snapped.

He shrugged. ""Look around you. The wealthiest people in the world came for me today. This suit I’m wearing cost more than you can make in your entire life. What more explanation do you want?""

Wow.

I always knew he was a cold, calculating bastard.

I just didn’t realize how deep it ran.

""Maybe chasing Alpha’s sister got you here faster. But you know what? When she finds out how shallow and cold you are. You’ll lose it all.""

Anger flared across his face.

""I know how to love someone! I just won't waste that on a small-town girl like you.” he said freezingly, “Are we done here?""

“No.”

I took a deep breath and got into the real reason I came.

""You're marrying a rich girl. Fine. But why did you have to get me fired?""

Yeah. I used to work for this jerk.

From intern to full-time at Apex Corp, he was my supervisor.

Our office romance was a secret. And just days ago, I found out he was getting married with Apex CEO’s sister. And I was out of a job thanks to him.

""Right, your job.” The jerk shrugged, “You got your job all thanks to me. Now that I’m not around, maybe they finally saw how incompetent and stupid you are. Problem?""

Was he fucking kidding me?!

""I graduated top of my class. Made it through 7 rounds of interviews. My performance exceeded every quarterly target. I earned that job!"" I snapped.

“Come on, Aria. You really gonna be so naïve?”

He walked closer, smirking.

""You passed the interviews because I said so. Your sales? I contacted those customers for you. Without me, you'd be nothing but a pretty face.""

He seized my chin and looked me over with a disgusting look. I slapped his hand away.

""Give me my job back,” I hissed, my voice slightly trembling. “My dad’s debt. My grandma’s medical bills…I need the money. You of all people should know what it’s like to be poor. Don’t. Make. Me. Beg.""

I was throwing my pride at his feet.

But he just laughed.

""Well, how about I offer you a deal?"" he said as though he’d been waiting for this moment.

He brushed my hair back, fingers trailing down to my collarbone. I shivered in disgust.

""You and I. We never fuck. You were so clinging to that pathetic no-sex-before-marriage rule. Maybe it's time to grow up. Let me fuck you once and I’ll write you very handsome check. How does that sound?""

I widened my eyes in shock.

Then I slapped him. HARD.

“FUCKING HELL…What the hell are you doing?! I’m getting married in front of everyone in fucking 10 minutes!” He roared covering his swollen face.

""Fuck you, Jace!” I yelled, “You're a spineless freeloading puss! And hey—congrats on the wedding. Hope your junk is soft like a fucking spaghetti tonight!""

Then I stormed out dragging my suitcase and boxes, ignoring his angry curses behind me.

Hot tears poured down as I dashed across the hallway.

God this couldn’t be any worse.

I was prepared to drop all my self-esteem and begged with my life. Because I needed the job and money.

But I still let him get to me.

Now what do I do?

My salary barely covered my rent, my father’s debt and grandma’s bill. Now with my job gone, I already got kicked out by my landlord. I probably had to sleep in a park tonight.

So do I go back and let that jerk win? Let him humiliate me...No. I’d rather die than that…

""Hey, watch where you're going!"" someone yelled.

Too late.

I slammed right into the man in front of me.

He was tall. So tall I felt like I’d just walked into a brick wall.

His diamond cufflink was sharp like a blade. When we collided, it sliced clean through my thin T-shirt with a loud rip.

In one second, the front of my shirt was torn open, exposing my white lace bra.

“Ah!” I gasped and looked up.

This was the most handsome man I’d ever seen. His face was like a statue carved by a master artist. And his expression was so cold and distant.

When he looked down at me, I swear I was about to drown in those stormy gray eyes of his.

Suddenly, I recognized who he was.

This was Alpha of Redstone Pack. CEO of Apex Corporation.

Jace’s brother-in-law.

THE legendary. Grayson Hart.

“Aria Collins?”

His voice was sexy and velvety.

He lowered his head and his eyes dropped to the exposed part of my bra. Maybe it was just my imagination, but the color of his eyes seemed to darken as he stared.

Wherever his gaze landed, my skin started burning up.

But wait.

How did he know my name?

# Chapter 2 With Ex's Brother-in-law

Aria’s POV

Of course I recognized him. God, who didn’t?

I’d met him at the Apex gala. His face was on every finance magazine cover, and any time you turned on a TV, there he was—linked to the latest scandal with some actress or model.

But there was no way he’d know who I was.

“I-I…Hello, Alpha Grayson,” I stammered.

He turned his eyes away and said to a nearby guard, “Escort Ms. Collins out.”

“Yes, Alpha.”

The guards stepped in immediately, stretching out their arms like I was some kind of contaminant that might taint Grayson’s perfectly tailored suit.

“Wait a minute. You’re not going to say something about my shirt?” It’s torn beyond repair and was showing my breasts.

He paused. Just for a brief second. Then flicked something down at my feet.

I looked down. A blank check.

“I need a shirt that can cover my front. Not your hush money.” I gritted with humiliation.

But he didn’t even glance back and just walked away.

“God,” I muttered under my breath.

Can you believe these rich bastards?

They think they can buy everything with money.

People nearby were all staring, snickering under their breath. I tried to cover my chest and grab my things to escape, but it was hard to do all that with just two hands.

“Oh my god…Aria Collins?”

Three girls emerged from the whispering crowd. I took one look at them and sighed internally.

Great. Just when I thought today couldn’t get any worse.

“Hello. Layla. Sabrina. Brielle.” I said dryly.

I used to work in the same team with these girls back at Apex. We were all under Jace.

These girls adored Jace. They spent more time flirting with him by the coffee machine than actually working. Which left me doing most of their work.

After I got fired, and when news of my secret relationship with Jace got out, they decided I was public enemy number one.

“What are you even doing here, Aria? Trying to win back your ex at his wedding? That’s a new low even for you,” Layla snickered.

“I’m not here to win anyone back.” I tried to push past them.

But they blocked me.

“What happened to your shirt?” Brielle snickered. “Did you seriously walk in here with your bra out? Is this like some low-budget fashion statement?”

They burst into laughter together.

“You could be completely naked and Jace still wouldn’t give a damn,” Sabrina squeaked. “Because he’s marrying Lady Delilah. THE Delilah Hart! Redstone Pack’s sweetheart. And you…well you’re just a poor-ass small-town girl.”

I stopped in my track and gave them a cold glare, “Oh yeah? Well at least this smalltown girl actually dated Jace. And you all got nothing. Do you know how many times I had to listen to him complained about your screechy voices and cheesy perfume after we got home? Apparently he rather be with me than any of you.”

Their jaws dropped.

“Jace would never say that!” Brielle cried.

“And my perfume isn’t cheesy!” Sabrina screamed.

“Word for word,” I rolled my eyes. “Now move. Or I’m rolling this suitcase over your pretty little skirts.”

They looked like ruffled chickens, but they parted. I quickly shoved my dingy luggage ahead like a weapon and stormed out of the church.

Rich people were assholes.

Grayson, Jace, and their whole damn minions.

I struggled to get my suitcase down the steps, and once I hit the street, cold wind slapped me in the face.

It’s almost night. But I had no idea where to go.

I could crash in the hospital with my grandma, but she’d ask too many questions. Like why I hadn’t brought Jace around recently, or why I wasn’t staying at my apartment. I didn’t want her to know how bad things had gotten.

I thought about the park. Sleeping on a bench. But in a ripped T-shirt that exposed my whole front? Horrible idea.

So I texted my best friend, May, asking to stay at her place for a few days. She was my rock. If the whole world turned against me, at least I still had her.

She texted back right away inviting me to come over.

Dragging my suitcase across the street toward the bus stop, I told myself it was going to be okay. This horrible day was going to end.

Then I heard them.

“Hey, nice shirt!”

A group of street wolves were loitering near the stop.

I hugged myself tighter and curled into the bench, hoping they’d get bored and leave.

“C’mon baby, drop your hands. Let us see what you’re working with.”

Go away. Go away. Go away.

“You rip that shirt yourself? Damn that’s wild. I like that in a girl.” One of them moved closer, reaching for my shoulder.

“Fuck off!” I snapped, my voice shaking.

But it only fired them up.

“Oh, feisty. Shake those tits for me!”

They grabbed my wrists, yanked my arms down. My T-shirt gaped open completely, revealing my lace bra. The cold air made my skin pebble. They laughed even louder.

I struggled and screamed. My wolf growled in rage.

Shifting in the city was illegal…but right now, I didn’t have a second choice…

Just then. Blinding headlights. Followed by screeching tires.

A silver car skidded to a stop inches away.

The door flew open. A deep voice thundered:

“Get in.”

I was too shocked that I didn’t think twice and obeyed. The car peeled away the second I shut the door.

“My suitcase!” I cried.

“Someone will get it,” he said darkly. “Address.”

I told the driver May’s, my body still shaking. Then he pressed a button. A privacy screen slid up between the front and back seats, sealing us in the back.

That’s when he turned toward me and leaned in. Like a beast ready to pounce.

His scent hit me. It’s sharp pine mixed with cold metal.

My head started to get dizzy.

“Walking on the street in that shirt was a mistake,” he said darkly.

“It got like this because of you,” I mumbled.

He snorted.

Then there’s the sound of rustling fabric. A heavy jacket landed across my shoulders. It was still warm from his body and carried his scent.

I held my breath.

Wearing his coat almost felt like…he was wrapping himself around me.

“Alpha Grayson…do you know me?” I whispered.

My gut told me that he would never do this for a strange girl. But if he knew who I was, he must know that I was his sister’s husband’s ex. That didn’t explain why he would help.

“We’ve met,” he said simply.

I stared at him, searching those icy gray eyes. He was staring at me too, with those cold, hungry, possessive eyes. I felt like I was completely naked in front of him.

“Aria,” he warned, voice thick and husky.

But I couldn’t control myself.

I was leaning forward.

Shit. Why did my body become so weird?

My skin was on fire. My panties were wet. All I wanted was more of his scent. More of his heat.

The next second his lips crashed onto mine. Hard. Rough.

I gasped and opened my mouth for him. His tongue slipped in and explored every inch of my mouth, making me shiver. His hands pushed into my torn shirt and grabbed my breast. I couldn’t control my moan when he touched my naked skin.

This…This was crazy.

He was a stranger, and most importantly, my ex’s brother-in-law.

And I was making out with him at the back of his car.

The crazy part was I didn’t even want to stop.

He lifted me onto his lap like I weighed nothing. I straddled his thighs and yanked at his tie as he bit my collarbone.

Then, suddenly, the car stopped.

“Alpha, we’ve arrived,” the driver said behind the screen.

That’s when it all froze.

His lips paused at my neck. I was still squirming on his lap, flushed and throbbing. But he shoved me off.

“We can’t do this,” he said coldly.

# Chapter 3 You're Special To Him

Aria’s POV

“So you’re telling me this guy made out with you in the backseat of his car… and then just shoved you off like nothing happened?” May asked in shock.

20 minutes later, I was sitting at her place, wrapped in one of her oversized hoodies, a steaming mug of tea in my hands.

But I was still reeling from everything that had just happened.

“Yup,” I muttered. “Who knows what’s wrong with him.”

“What an asshole,” she huffed. “But honestly, this really isn’t like you. You dated that jerk Jace for 4 years and didn’t even sleep with him—which, by the way, was a brilliant choice—and now you're suddenly making out with a complete stranger in his car?”

I opened my mouth but had no idea what to say. Yeah, she had a point.

“I—I don’t know. Maybe it was the whole Jace-getting-married thing. Maybe I just snapped and wanted to screw around with someone hotter just to get back at him…Honestly, it was so stupid now that I think of it.”

She grinned and wiggled her brows. “So… he was hot huh?”

My cheeks flushed and my mind drifted back.

Those stormy gray eyes, his perfectly shaped lips on my neck, and those arms that could pick me up like I weighed nothing…Shit I need to stop.

“Yeah. VERY,” I whispered, hiding my red face behind the mug.

May burst out laughing. “Now we’re talking! That’s exactly what you need right now—a drop-dead gorgeous rebound to get that loser Jace out of your system. Screw your ‘no sex before marriage’ rule. Life is short.”

I gave her a weak smile.

Honestly, I didn’t need a rebound. I needed a job, money, and a place to live. Grayson Hart was like dessert when you can’t even afford dinner.

“So… do you even know who this guy was?” she asked.

I hesitated. Right at this moment, the doorbell rang.

She jumped up to get it and came back a few minutes later, hauling in my luggage, her face frozen in disbelief.

“OMG. You are not gonna believe what just showed up outside.”

“Umm… my luggage?” I joked.

“Two fucking muscular guys in black suits and guns! And a freaking stretch limo! They called me ‘ma’am’ and said they hope Miss Aria has a wonderful evening. Now, you—”

She leapt at me and shook me by the shoulders.

“—you tell me right now who the hell you hooked up with!”

I squealed and dropped into the couch with her, laughing and giggling breathlessly.

“Okay, okay—I’ll tell you. It was… Grayson Hart.”

I practically whispered his name.

Because honestly, I still couldn’t believe it either.

May froze, eyes wide as saucers. “Grayson—THE Grayson Hart?! As in our Alpha? The CEO of Apex?!”

“And Jace’s soon-to-be brother-in-law. Now you know how stupid I was earlier?”

She let out a full-on scream. Then she grabbed my hand, her face flushed with excitement. “Oh my God! Aria, do you know what this means? Alpha Grayson never even lends his jacket to his model girlfriends. He likes you. You’re special!”

“No,” I said firmly. “If I was special, he wouldn’t have thrown me off his lap when I tried to take off his shirt.”

“Maybe he had somewhere to be—”

“Don’t, May. Let’s be real. Guys like him don’t fall for girls like me.” I took another sip of tea, hiding the ache in my chest.

Hell even Jace thought I was beneath him.

What chance did I have with Grayson freaking Hart?

“Don’t be silly, Aria. You’re gorgeous. And smart and amazing and—WAIT! I just had the best idea ever.”

“What?”

“That arrogant jerk Jace thinks you’re just some small-town prude who wasn’t good enough for him right? But what if you ended up with Alpha Grayson? It’ll be easy to get him because he’s already obsessed. Oh, it would destroy Jace. That dickhead would never recover.”

OKAY.

I’d be lying if I said that exact scenario hadn’t crossed my mind when Grayson kissed me back.

What girl hasn’t daydreamed about dating the perfect guy and getting revenge in the most dramatic way possible?

But right now, I couldn’t afford to daydream. Reality was already breathing down my neck.

“Tempting. But right now I need a job and enough cash to keep Grandma in her hospital bed. Dating rich dudes isn’t exactly high on my to-do list.”

May looked at me with soft eyes. “So…any plans? I can try to hook you up with a job, but you know I just work at a coffee shop, and with your degree, you deserve so much more.”

I hugged her. “Thank you. Really. I’ll figure something out. Apex promised me severance when they fired me, so I’m going to HR tomorrow to get it sorted.”

If I could get that money, at least I’d be OK for the next round of Grandma’s medical bills.

—

The next morning, I showed up at Apex right on time.

But the second Brielle walked in with the HR manager, I had a bad feeling.

“What’s she doing here?” I asked coldly.

“I’ll explain in a minute,” HR replied with a polite, rehearsed smile as she sat across from me. “So Ms. Collins, I understand you’re here to discuss severance?”

“Yes. So let’s not waste time. Just give me the check and I’ll be out of here.”

“Unfortunately, severance only applies when the company terminates a contract without cause. In your case… it appears you were let go due to misconduct.”

Misconduct?

What the freaking hell.

“Jace made a snap decision and booted me. What misconduct are you talking about?”

“But that’s not what Mr. Carter said. He provided evidence that you made a costly error on a sales quote—omitting a few zeroes, to be exact. Cost the company millions. Here’s the email record.”

She handed me a printed sheet.

I swore I had never sent this email in my life. But there it was—my name in the sender field.

No freaking way.

Jace forged this.

“And Mr. Carter reported that you had a difficult attitude toward your coworkers. Quote: ‘impatient and arrogant.’ Brielle’s here to verify that.”

Brielle twirled her hair and smiled smugly. “Yeah. Aria was a horrible team player.”

I stood so fast my chair screeched. “The only thing I didn’t ‘teamplayed’ with you was flirt with the boss in the breakroom!”

“Liar!” she yelled. “And I asked Jace. He never said my voice was screechy!”

Oh my God. I couldn’t believe how stupid she was.

“Sit down, Miss Collins,” HR warned. “As of now, not only are you not getting severance, but we’re also considering legal action to recover the losses. If you understand the situation here, sign this acknowledgement—”

“Does Alpha Grayson know about this?” I asked.

Both of them froze. After a long pause, HR finally found her voice. “What does Alpha Grayson have to do with any of this?”

“He owns Apex, doesn’t he? Does he know his team is abusing their power and firing hardworking employees illegally?”

HR frowned. Brielle let out a loud snort. “Please. Don’t act like you know Alpha Grayson.”

“What if I do? What if I go to him and then it’s you who gets fired?”

She laughed in my face. “Oh, you mean you know him on TV?”

“Let’s find out.”

I shoved my chair back and stormed out, heading straight for the CEO’s private elevator at the end of the hall. HR scrambled after me, shouting my name.

I was too furious to care how this ended. All I wanted now was to blow the whole damn place up.

Two guards stood by the elevator.

“I need to see Alpha Grayson,” I told them.

“Appointment?”

“No, but I swear he knows me. Just tell him it’s Aria—from yesterday. He’ll remember.”

“You aren’t the first girl here saying that,” one of them mocked.

“Come on, Miss Collins,” HR snapped, trying to drag me back. “This is getting crazy. Go back, sign the paper. Take responsibility for your own mistake.”

“I didn’t send that email. It was Jace—he’s framing me! I will report all of you.”

“Alpha Grayson doesn’t have time for your report, or your visit, or any of your little drama!”

“I believe no one but me has the right to decide that,” a cold voice said behind us.

# Chapter 4 Take Me, Please

Aria’s POV

A large hand grabbed my arm and pulled me away from HR’s grip.

I looked up and my heart almost stopped.

Even I couldn’t believe he just showed up here. It felt like a dream.

“A-Alpha Grayson,” HR stammered, her face frozen with shock and fear.

“I don’t need employees who think they can make decisions for their boss,” he said freezingly while wrapping his arm around my waist. “If I see something like this again, you’re fired.”

“Y-yes, Alpha. I’m terribly sorry…”

HR’s expression was priceless, but I was in no mood to enjoy it. His icy pine scent consumed me again, making my body weak and hot. My wolf let out a soft purr, urging me to lean into him. But before I could even move, he let go.

A pang of disappointment hit me in the chest.

“Come,” he said shortly, striding toward the private elevator.

I shot HR and the stunned security guards a smug look, then hurried after him.

He swiped his card and the elevator doors closed. We started going up to the 58th floor.

It was dead silent. My heart was beating so wildly that I was afraid he’d hear it. I snuck a glance at him—he just stared straight ahead, emotionless, keeping a distance, like he wanted to be anywhere but here.

Unease twisted my stomach.

“So, um… what brings you here today?” I broke the silence.

He sighed softly. “I owe this company.”

“Oh, Oh…Right.”

I wanted to punch myself in the face.

The awkward silence lingered until the elevator dinged open. The 58th floor was a wide-open space with no cubicles or dividers—just massive floor-to-ceiling windows and a sweeping view of the entire city.

“Wow,” I whispered under my breath. Grayson was already walking ahead.

I jogged to catch up as he led me into an office at the far end of the floor. A stunning female assistant closed the door behind us, and once again, it was just the two of us. My heart rocketed back into my throat.

He casually unbuttoned his jacket. It was amazing how he made even that look sexy.

“So you insisted on seeing me?” he asked.

He didn’t ask me to sit. He didn’t even move closer. That distance stung a little.

“I worked here till a week ago when I found out I was let go for no reason…” I quickly told him the story of how I was fired. “This is clearly illegal in so many ways… can you help me get my job back?”

“Unfortunately, no,” he replied, barely hesitating.

My heart dropped like a stone. “Why not?”

“I’ll have the hiring department look into whether your termination followed proper protocol. But this isn’t something a CEO handles directly. Anything else?”

The hiring department?

That could take weeks—and I didn’t have weeks.

“No… you don’t get it,” I stepped forward, my voice trembling. “My grandma’s in the hospital. Her bills are getting insane every month. And I’m already deep in debt… If I can’t make money, I don’t even know— I really, REALLY need this job.”

I knew we came from two different worlds, but laying out the most desperate parts of my life in front of him still made me feel horribly exposed. I just hoped—begged—that he’d understand.

But he didn’t.

His gray eyes stayed emotionless.

“I’m sorry, Miss Collins,” he said quietly.

Tears rushed into my eyes. I couldn’t even breathe.

All I could think about were the bills, the debt, the mountain of shit waiting for me the second I left this building.

“If there’s nothing else, my assistant will show you out.” he said, reaching for the intercom.

I rushed forward and pressed my hand down on his before he could call anyone in.

His whole body stiffened—but he didn’t pull away. He just stared down at me. I stepped in closer, tilting my head up. His gray eyes darkened like a storm brewing in the distance.

His pine scent wrapped around me again, thick and intoxicating. As werewolves, our scent only spikes during a fight or sexual arousal. It was damn obvious which case this was.

“You clearly feel something for me,” I whispered.

He said nothing. I placed my hand on his chest and felt his heartbeat. It was racing as well. His breathing had also turned shallow.

“What are you doing, Miss Collins?” he asked tightly. “Trying to seduce your way into a job?”

“You can do whatever you want,” I locked eyes with him. “I won’t stop you.”

His Adam’s apple bobbed. God, I wanted to lick it.

And… well, I did.

I leaned up and pressed my lips to it. He let out a growl.

The next second, I was pinned on his desk. He stood between my spread legs, one hand by my head. I whimpered, clamping my thighs together—the heat between them was almost unbearable. Just like in the backseat of his car.

His hand slid from the desk to my throat. It was so big, he could probably snap my neck if he wanted.

“You shouldn’t keep tempting me, Miss Collins.”

His body was pressed against my thighs—I definitely felt the effect I was having on him.

“Why?” I whispered, licking my lips. “Because your self-control isn’t as strong as you thought?”

“Because I don’t fuck virgins.”

What the actual hell???

The next second, he had pulled away. I scrambled off the desk, face red, eyes wide.

“What did you just say?!” I snapped. “Why—How the hell do you even know—?”

“I know who you are. And I know about your relationship with my sister’s husband.”

And just like that, everything clicked.

It was Jace.

That bastard didn’t just dump me—he ran his mouth about my virginity to everyone, including Grayson.

Humiliation crashed over me like a wave.

“Jace is a fucking asshole,” I snapped shakily.

Grayson shrugged. “Obviously. But Brielle likes him. And he’s family now. I’m sorry but I just can’t get involved in this.”

I climbed off his desk with my whole body red and shaking.

He didn’t want me. And he was taking his sister and Jace’s side.

I was so damn stupid to think that one kiss in the car actually meant anything. But this was Grayson Hart for Christ’s sake. He could have anyone he wanted.

“I’m sure you’re a very capable employee, Miss Collins. But seducing me won’t help your career. I wish you all the best.”

He finally pressed the intercom button. His assistant appeared at the door, waiting for me to leave.

“Bye,” I whispered without even look back. I didn’t want him to notice my falling tears.

I walked out of that office, numb, and rode the elevator down like a ghost. My mind was a storm of bills, debt, and Grayson’s ice-cold stare. Now I desperately needed a new job.

“Miss Collins!”

I turned and saw his assistant come rushing out again, holding an envelope.

“Alpha Grayson asked me to give you this,” she said, handing it over.

“What is it?” Why didn’t he give it to me earlier?

“He didn’t say. Maybe you’ll know once you open it.”

She gave me a mysterious smile and walked away.

I opened the envelope. A blank check slid out first—I held my breath in shock.

Then I found a crumpled note. His handwriting, rushed and messy.

Haven’t repaid you for the shirt. Hope everything works out for you Aria. Stay strong. —Grayson

# Chapter 5 Getting My Attention

Aria’s POV

“That check clearly means something,” May insisted.

“Come on. We’re not doing this again,” I sighed.

“If he’s not into you, then why did he give you that check? He probably saw you crying and couldn’t stand it. You should definitely go back and see him again.”

“Nope,” I shut it down immediately. “I had one perfect, fairytale encounter with a rich bachelor. That’s enough. I’m not about to go back there and humiliate myself all over again.”

“But—”

“Hey, you two!” our manager yelled from the other end of the aisle. “Less talking, more working!”

We rolled our eyes at each other and got back to inventory.

May had helped me land this supermarket job.

It was part of a chain under a big corporation, so the pay and benefits weren’t bad. May still thought it was beneath someone with my degree, but honestly, I was just grateful to be employed.

Once we finished our section, the manager wandered off to shout at someone else, and May scooted back over to me.

“Just imagine it,” she grinned. “You could write a couple million on that blank check and…BOOM! Instant rich girl life.”

“I’m not gonna do that.”

“Sure you won’t. You’re too nice,” she muttered, half-admiring, half-scolding. “So? What are you gonna write?”

I hesitated.

At first, I actually considered writing the price of a shirt. 19.99 that was. Because apparently, my dignity still thinks it matters.

But let’s be real, Grayson wasn’t just paying me back for a ripped tee, or he would’ve simply handed his assistant a $20 bill.

Maybe… he felt bad I lost my job too.

“I’m going to write the amount I should’ve gotten in severance,” I admitted eventually.

May's eyes bulged. “That’s it?!”

“I know it’s not much, but it’s what I actually deserve. And it’ll help me cover 2 months of bills.”

May sighed and looked at me like I was the biggest idiot alive. But my mind was made up.

I just wanted to walk away from the mess as quickly as possible. I still wanted to rip Jace’s smug face off, but the best revenge right now was surviving.

6 hours later, we finally finished our shift, exhausted and aching.

Everyone else got to clock out, but not me. I’d volunteered for night shift and closing duties.

The staffs left one by one, yawning, including May. Finally I was alone in this big market.

Now here’s the big secret—

I actually lived here now.

Nobody knew this, not even May.

She thought I’d found a new apartment and moved out, but I just couldn’t keep bothering her anymore. Her roommates were getting irritated with me hogging the living room and utilities.

And renting my own place seemed way out of budget now.

So I stayed in this supermarket instead.

I closed up the store at night and opened it early in the morning. For the 5 or 6 hours in between, I made a bed out of my coat and slept on the floor near the refrigerated section.

Now don’t ask me why I can’t sleep in the staff’s break room. That room was too hot without AC. At least it was cool by the freezer.

Tonight I was extra exhausted. The manager made us girls haul too many heavy crates around. I fell asleep on the floor in seconds.

It felt like I’d only been asleep for 5 minutes. My alarm hadn’t even gone off yet.

And I was jolted awake by someone screaming:

“—OH MY GOD! What the hell are you doing?!”

I shot upright, still half-asleep.

And I froze.

In front of me stood an entire group of people. Including the manager and several guys in suits. They were all staring at me wide eyes.

And I was only in a tank top and shorts. Half naked.

OH GOD.

What the hell…Is it morning already?!

Why didn’t I hear my alarm?

I scrambled to pull my clothes over my body, my hands shaking.

The stares didn’t stop. They got more invasive.

“Aria Collins! What the fuck are you doing?!” the manager stormed over and roared. “Napping half-naked in my fucking store?! Are you a fucking sex perv?!”

My face went beet red, “No! I—I was just staying here temporarily—”

“Temporarily?!” he yelled, eyes bulging. “I hired an employee, not a fucking squatter! How much water and electricity have you used free?! Have you been stealing food too?!”

“No I swear! I shut everything off when I’m done, I don’t use the water unless I have to…And I paid for everything I’ve eaten!”

Tears blurred my vision as I tried to explain, but he wasn’t listening. His spit actually hit my cheek as he snarled.

“Of all days—you had to pick the day corporate shows up to camp out in my perfect store. You filthy, disgusting little—”

“Aria Collins?”

A new voice called my name. It came from one of those suited men.

I looked up. And my heart dropped.

God I knew this guy. I think his name is Jonathan. A former coworker of mine from Apex.

“Holy shit, it is you,” he grinned in surprise, raising his brows. “Almost didn’t recognize you at first.”

“You… what are you doing here?” I stammered.

“Apex owns this supermarket chain. We’re doing site inspections today,” he said with a smirk, his eyes trailing down to my bare legs. “Man! Most people hit rock bottom after getting fired from Apex, but you fall faster than anyone.”

“I’m working. Making a decent living,” I said in shaky voice. “There’s no shame with that.”

“Oh really?” he sneered. “Does your job include lying around half-naked on the floor? What is this, a new hooker gimmick?”

The suits burst out laughing. My furious tears were on the verge of falling.

“I’m so sorry, sir. I’ll fire her right away.” The manager groaned.

“Hold up,” Jonathan drawled with a smirk. “This chick got fired from Apex for messing up a seven-figure deal. You might wanna check your inventory. She could be stealing.”

I was furious. “You know that’s a lie! Jace made it all up. I never made a single mistake at work—”

“Oh please,” he cut me off. “Everyone in the industry knows how you fucked up. Jace was so embarrassed that he had to apologize to all the customers for you.”

The manager grabbed my wrist. “Then you’re definitely stealing from this market as well. That’s it. You are going to jail. When I figure out what you’ve taken, you must pay back everything!”

My heart pounded in my chest.

I didn’t doubt for a second that the manager would come up with something that I didn’t steal, just like how Jace framed me before. It wasn’t hard for guys like them.

But I couldn’t go to jail.

My grandma had no one to count on but me. I can’t leave her.

I knew what I had to do.

The wolf in me surfaced up the next second. I snarled at the manager, yanked my arm free, and ran.

“Stop her!” someone shouted behind me.

I had no idea where I was going. I just fucking ran. Desperate and horrified.

At the door, I slammed right into someone coming in.

“Get away from Alpha!” a bodyguard barked.

I staggered back in panic. But a large hand caught my wrist, steadying me.

“Aria?”

I looked up, still shaking involuntarily.

God, it’s indeed him! I couldn’t believe he’s here.

There’s a tight furrow between Grayson’s brows as he checked me up. Then he quickly unbuttoned his coat and wrapped me in, covering my half-naked body.

“It’s OK.” his voice was deep with clear hint of rage.

I clutched his shirt, gasping for air.

But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t seem to breathe at all. Tears streamed down my cheeks.

“She’s having a panic attack,” a woman said nearby. “Alpha, if I may—”

I silently prayed him not to hand me over. And he didn’t.

“It’s fine, Nova. She stays with me,” he refused. “Aria. Breathe.”

Panicked footsteps echoed behind us. Jonathan’s voice rang out, stunned:

“Alpha Grayson! W-What’s going on here?!”

“Nova,” Grayson said in a cold, dangerous voice, “Stay here. Don’t let anyone leave.”

“Yes, Alpha.”

He scooped me up like I weighed nothing, one arm under my legs, the other around my back. I instinctively wrapped my arms around his neck.

Then he carried me through the astonished crowd, into the store, and found a private room.

“You’re safe here,” he said after he shut the door.

That’s when I broke down. Crying out loud.

Fear, shame, panic—everything spilled out in a messy, helpless flood.

I clutched his wrist like it was the only thing keeping me from falling apart. He didn’t pull away.

I cried for 10 minutes straight He waited for my sobs to quiet down.

“Th-thank you…I’m better now.” I sniffled eventually.

He wiped a tear from my cheek with his thumb. I shivered at the way he touched my skin.

“You are always a mess when I find you,” he said. “Why is that?”

“I don’t know…Fate?” I choked.

He let out a dark chuckle. “This is not good.”

“W-Why?” I didn’t mean to be miserable all the time.

His voice was low, rough, and strained.

“Because it’s getting harder and harder for me to leave you like this,” he said.

1pphn8o,https://i.redd.it/jft050nt2w7g1.png,"My Husband's Rules | No touching, no kissing","Chapter 1

No touching, no kissing, no sex.

That was the strict rules that Rosalie's husband Benjamin set for her.

Because he had severe germophobia.

Once, she accidentally drank from his cup.

He threw the cup straight into the trash in disgust, as if it were covered in poison.

Another time, she got a high fever. When she woke up, she asked him for a hug for comfort.

His brows furrowed. His cold voice carried a warning. ""Rosalie, don't test my limits.""

During her period, she accidentally stained the passenger seat in his car.

He held his breath, pulled over, and immediately called his assistant to sell the car.

After that, she was never allowed to sit in any of his cars again.

Rosalie cried in silence but said nothing. She just became even more careful, respecting his obsessive habits.

Before sleeping beside him, she would shower three times, making sure not a single speck of dust was left.

Just to hold his hand, she wiped her palms with disinfectant until they turned red, then touched him carefully, promising again and again that she was clean.

She thought that if she followed Benjamin's rules long enough, one day he'd let her into his world.

Until both she and his widowed sister-in-law Cassandra, fell into the river, Rosalie realized the one he loved was Cassandra.

If Benjamin didn't treasure her, then she didn't want him anymore.

She would marry his lifelong rival.

The man who had proposed to her 9,999 times, Oliver Vargas.

\*\*\*

After visiting the cemetery, the car carrying her and Cassandra was hit halfway home.

Everything spun. Both of them fell into the muddy river beside the road.

""Help...""

Rosalie couldn't swim. Out of instinct, she opened her mouth to shout, but only swallowed more dirty river water.

Through the blur, she saw Benjamin jump in without hesitation.

Her survival instincts kicked in. She reached her hand toward him. ""Ben... help me...""

But then, Cassandra's voice rang out at the same time.

""Benny... help me...""

Benjamin hesitated only for a second before swimming straight past Rosalie toward Cassandra.

""Rosa, Cassie can't swim. I'll save her first. Hold on!""

Rosalie's pupils contracted. Her heart felt as if it had been pierced by ice.

She tried to grab his sleeve, but before her fingers even touched the fabric, he swung his arm hard and shoved her away.

As the suffocating pain grew stronger, her arms and legs started to lose strength.

All she could do was watch the light on the water's surface blur and fade away...

She and Benjamin first met during a bank robbery.

He was wearing a black designer suit, looking calm and noble among the terrified crowd.

When the police arrived, the robber panicked and grabbed him as a hostage.

Benjamin didn't even flinch. With just one sharp look, he cooperated with the police to shoot the robber dead.

When the gun went off, everyone else trembled in fear.

Only he stayed calm, his eyes glancing down coldly at the robber's curled-up body. His strong brows didn't even twitch.

Rosalie couldn't take her eyes off him, her heart trembling.

She begged her father to introduce them.

Her father saw right through her and immediately disagreed.

""You can like anyone you want, just not Benjamin. He's got severe germophobia. Dozens of women have tried, but none ever got close.""

""So what? I'm beautiful, I've got a good figure, and I'm nice. I can win his heart.""

Back then, she was full of confidence, bright and radiant, chasing after him everywhere.

When she learned he liked bread pudding from the South Side of Chicago, she drove across half the city just to bring him a warm serving.

When he got sick overseas while on a business trip, she chartered a private plane, flew to his hotel, and took care of him for three days straight.

The most dangerous time was when he went to a mountain site and got caught in a landslide. Ignoring everyone's warnings, she dug him out of the mud with her bare hands.

After that, he proposed to her.

""I need someone to marry for the family's benefit.""

No ring. Not a single word about love.

She was overjoyed, holding his arm, asking if he had finally fallen for her.

Benjamin quietly brushed her hand off and gave a faint ""yeah.""

Blinded by happiness, Rosalie didn't notice the flash of disgust in his eyes.

But when she thought back, the day he proposed to her...

It was the same day Cassandra married Benjamin's eldest brother, Joseph Malone!

So Benjamin never loved her!

Rosalie's love was just his way of patching up a broken heart!

Before Rosalie lost consciousness, a bodyguard pulled her out of the river.

But even after she reached the shore, Benjamin didn't look at her once. He held Cassandra tightly, whispering to her.

""It's okay.

""You're safe now. I've got you.""

He had always hated dirt, but now his expensive suit was soaked with foul, muddy water. Grime clung to his hair, yet he didn't seem to care.

All he cared about was the woman in his arms.

There was a tenderness in his eyes that he had never given Rosalie.

Shivering, Rosalie wrapped her arms around herself as hot tears streamed down.

She had truly believed he had severe germophobia.

A year of dating, three years of marriage, over 1,200 days and nights, she followed every rule he made.

But now Rosalie knew... that wasn't it.

Those rules were only for her. For Cassandra, there were none.

How ironic!

How ridiculous!

Cassandra noticed the look on Rosalie's face, and pride flashed in her eyes. She suddenly clutched her chest. ""My necklace! Benny, the necklace you gave me is gone!""

Benjamin immediately said, ""It must've fallen in the river. Don't worry. I'll find it.""

Without hesitation, he jumped back into the filthy water.

After diving several times, he finally found Cassandra's necklace and handed it to her like a prize.

""Don't cry anymore. I found it.""

Rosalie let out a bitter laugh. Her hands trembled as she wiped her tears and pulled out her phone. For the first time, she replied to that same message she had been getting for years—

""For the 9,999th time. Rosie, when are you divorcing Benjamin and marrying me?""

Through blurry vision, she typed each word carefully.

""Return from abroad and find me after thirty days.""

If Benjamin didn't treasure her, then she didn't want him anymore.

She would marry her lifelong rival. The man who had proposed to her 9,999 times, Oliver Vargas.

Chapter 2

Rosalie and Cassandra were both sent to the hospital.

The moment Benjamin stepped into the hospital hallway, the air around him seemed to grow colder. A faint trace of disgust and discomfort flashed through his pale blue eyes.

But after glancing at Cassandra, he forced himself to hold it in and stayed by her side the whole time, never taking a single step away.

Rosalie's gaze fell on them, and it felt as if someone had carved a hole through her heart. The emptiness hurt so much she could barely breathe.

During their three years of marriage, Benjamin hadn't always been cold to her.

When he came home from parties, he would sometimes bring her a cup of her favorite gelato.

When she felt down, he would pat her head gently through his gloves.

But when she once got a high fever and begged him to come visit her at the hospital, he said.

""Rosalie, stop forcing me. You know hospitals are full of germs, and I have serious germophobia.""

Yet now, in front of Cassandra, his germophobia seemed miraculously cured. He actually stepped into the hospital. The very place he had always feared like the plague.

She had once heard someone say that love meant unconditional tolerance and compromise.

Just like how she did for Benjamin, and how Benjamin did for Cassandra.

\*\*\*

After leaving the hospital, Rosalie took the divorce papers that her lawyer had drafted and went to see Benjamin.

""I want a divorce. Sign it.""

Benjamin pursed his thin lips tightly. ""Just because I didn't save you first? Rosalie, Cassie can't swim. Of course I had to save her first!""

Rosalie couldn't help but laugh, though her eyes burned with tears. ""She can't swim! Do you think I can?""

Benjamin froze for two seconds. Then impatience flashed between his brows. ""Even if you can't, even if I didn't save you, you're still fine, aren't you?""

His self-righteous tone hit her like fire, burning through every bit of her heart.

All her struggle, longing, and unwillingness to let go turned to ashes in that fire.

Only bone-deep emptiness was left.

She didn't want to argue anymore. Too tired to care, she closed her eyes and pointed to the signature line. ""Sign it.""

Benjamin didn't move. His cold eyes were sharp as ice. ""Can you stop being unreasonable?""

With a click, the door opened from the outside.

Cassandra walked in. When she saw the divorce papers spread on the table, the corners of her mouth lifted ever so slightly.

She first handed a cup of hot tea to Benjamin and said softly, ""Rosalie, Ben didn't mean it. Here. Have some hot tea. It's my way of apologizing for him.""

Her expression was gentle, but pride flickered in her eyes.

A sharp pain struck Rosalie's heart. Without thinking, she swung her hand. ""Get out of my way.""

Smash.

The cup shattered, and the tea spilled everywhere.

Cassandra screamed and fell to the floor.

Benjamin's face changed instantly. Without hesitation, he lifted Cassandra into his arms and set her on the couch.

""Are you hurt?""

Cassandra leaned weakly against his chest, her voice trembling with grievance. ""I'm fine. I just wanted to talk to her. I didn't expect...""

""It's not your fault."" Benjamin's fingers twitched as he fought the urge to touch her cheek. His icy blue eyes shot toward Rosalie. ""You want a divorce, right? Fine. As you wish.""

He signed his name in bold, elegant strokes and tossed the papers at her. ""I hope you don't regret it.""

Regret?

The only thing she ever regretted in this life was marrying him.

That bitter thought flashed through Rosalie's mind. She turned to leave, but behind her came Cassandra's soft voice and Benjamin's low reply.

""Benny, you actually signed it? Aren't you afraid she'll really divorce you?""

Benjamin's tone held a hint of mockery. ""She loves me too much to leave. It's just a little trick to get my attention. Now, let me see if your foot is hurt.""

Rosalie's steps faltered. She turned instinctively.

Under the dim light, Benjamin knelt on one knee, carefully holding Cassandra's foot on his lap. His expression was gentle and focused.

Germophobia?

What a serious case of germophobia.

Chapter 3

The next morning, Rosalie went to the courthouse to file for divorce.

When she returned to the villa, she saw Benjamin teaching Cassandra how to drive.

His hand rested lightly on hers. The space between them was so small that the air inside the car felt charged with tension.

Rosalie suddenly remembered all the times she had wiped her skin raw with disinfectant just to get close to him.

To Benjamin, his wife was nothing but a carrier of germs. If she wanted to touch him, she had to scrub herself clean first.

But... Cassandra was his exception. The one he treated like a holy item. Even if she were covered in dirt, he would still let her come close to him.

It is true that love always reveals itself.

She was the fool for never noticing it.

Rosalie looked away coldly and walked toward the villa. But then, the sharp roar of a car engine suddenly sounded behind her.

The next second, she felt her body fly into the air before crashing down like a rag doll. A burning pain shot through every inch of her body like a red-hot iron.

She lay amid shattered glass, choking as blood filled her mouth. Through the cracked windshield, she saw what happened inside the car.

Benjamin was holding Cassandra tightly in his arms, his face tense. ""Are you okay? Did you get hurt?""

Cassandra's voice trembled. ""I'm fine. But Rosa looks really hurt. Benny, hurry and take her to the hospital.""

Through her blurry vision, Rosalie saw Benjamin glance at her, his voice icy.

""No. She's covered in blood. It's dirty.""

Tears mixed with blood slid down her cheeks.

Rosalie let out a broken laugh as pain spread through her chest, tearing her apart from the inside.

She couldn't bear it anymore. Darkness closed in, and she passed out.

\*\*\*

When she woke up again, Rosalie was in a hospital.

Benjamin's face was tight with restraint as he reached out to help her. But then, as if remembering something, he took out his gloves and put them on.

One pair wasn't enough, so he put on two more.

Pain stabbed deep in Rosalie's chest. She sneered. ""If you don't want to touch me, don't force yourself.""

Benjamin pulled his hand back and handed her the bowl of chicken broth the maid had made. ""Eat something first.""

Once, Rosalie would have been deeply touched.

Now, it only felt like mockery.

She said nothing, just quietly took the bowl.

When she finished, Benjamin's furrowed brows relaxed slightly. His voice was calm. ""Cassie's pregnant with Joseph's child. She wants to have the beef broth you make. I'll have the driver take you home so you can cook for her.""

So that was why he'd endured his germophobia, stayed with her in the hospital, and even brought her soup.

Not out of concern, but because he wanted her... to cook for Cassandra.

Rosalie's fingers clenched under the blanket, fury boiling inside her chest.

""Benjamin, are you insane? She hit me with her car, and you want me to make beef broth for her?""

Benjamin met her bloodshot eyes. Something inside him twitched.

He thought he was imagining it. His brows furrowed, his tone cold. ""She didn't mean it. The doctor said you weren't badly hurt and can move just fine. And it's just beef broth. How much effort could that take?""

Rosalie's chest heaved. She grabbed the water cup on the nightstand and hurled it at him.

""Get out!

""Get out of my sight!""

Benjamin dodged, irritation flickering across his face.

He tore off his gloves and, as if offering her mercy, grabbed Rosalie's right hand and intertwined their fingers.

""Now, is this enough?""

Rosalie stared at him, tears streaming down her face and splashing onto the back of her hand, cold as ice.

What kind of man had she fallen in love with?

How could he be so heartless? How could he... humiliate her like this?

In the end, the bodyguards dragged her back to the villa, forcing her to make beef broth for Cassandra.

When she was finally sent back to the hospital, her weak body gave out, and she drifted into sleep.

But before long, sharp pain shot through her wrist.

Then, someone yanked her hard and threw her to the floor.

Chapter 4

Rosalie's back hit the cold floor hard. Sharp pain shot through her body, and cold sweat broke out across her forehead.

""Benjamin! What are you doing?!""

Benjamin's face was dark as night, the chill in his pale blue eyes almost solid.

""Rosalie, I could understand if you were mad that Cassie ran into you. But why did you drug her beef broth? Do you know she almost lost the baby because of you?""

Rosalie tried to get up, but the bodyguard twisted her arms behind her back and pinned her to the ground.

Her cheek was pressed against the rough floor and her skin was burning, but it was nothing compared to the pain in her heart.

She trembled with rage. ""Benjamin, if you're sick, go to a mental hospital! Stop making things up! Why would I drug her for no reason?""

Benjamin stared at her pale face, his cold eyes showing no pity.

""She didn't eat anything today except the beef broth you made.

""If you won't admit it, then stay put until you understand what you've done wrong.""

Fear flashed in Rosalie's eyes, her teeth chattering.

""No... Benjamin! You... you can't do this to me!""

The only answer she got was Benjamin's icy order. ""Take her down.""

Rosalie tried to fight, but the hands on her were like iron clamps.

She was dragged out by the bodyguards toward the pool next to the hospital.

Splash.

Her body hit the water and was instantly enveloped by the freezing water.

Rosalie choked on a mouthful of water that reeked of chlorine. Fire burned down her throat and into her lungs, leaving her gasping and unable to breathe.

She called out instinctively, ""Benjamin...""

Through the rippling water, Benjamin stood still, his cold gaze even harder than ice.

Hopelessness filled Rosalie's eyes. She struggled to reach the edge, but her body felt as heavy as lead.

Just when she thought she was about to drown, a bodyguard pulled her out and threw her at Benjamin's feet.

She was soaked from head to toe, her wounds tearing open again. Blood mixed with the pool water and formed a pool beneath her.

Benjamin took a step back, his tone cold. ""Do you admit your mistake now?""

Rosalie coughed hard, her beautiful face white as paper. ""It wasn't me...""

Splash.

The next second, she was thrown into the pool again.

It happened again and again until she had no strength left to fight. She let herself sink.

So be it.

Let it end here.

She didn't want to live anymore.

The blue tiles at the bottom of the pool grew clearer, closer.

Just then, someone pulled her up once more.

Through the ringing in her ears, she heard Benjamin answer a call.

""Have you investigated properly? It really wasn't her?

""Alright, I got it.""

Her trembling, wet body finally gave out. Everything went black as she collapsed to the ground.

\*\*\*

Rosalie woke from pain.

The sharp smell of disinfectant filled her nose. Agony spread through her body, her chest burning as if needles were stabbing her lungs. She let out a soft cry.

""How do you feel? The doctor said you have pneumonia. You'll need to stay here for two days.""

Rosalie turned her head and saw Benjamin sitting nearby.

He was still in his black suit, cold and distant, untouchable as ever.

But now, the eyes that were always cold held a trace of guilt.

""We investigated the matter. It really had nothing to do with you. The nurse mixed up the medicine,"" he said, glancing at her again. ""This was my fault. Whatever you want as compensation, I'll provide it.""

Rosalie didn't look at him. Her voice was faint. ""No need. If you really want to make it up to me, leave me alone so I can rest.""

She understood now that Benjamin had only ever cared about Cassandra. He only offered compensation because he didn't want her to cause any trouble for Cassandra.

Benjamin frowned at how lifeless she looked. Something stirred in his chest, a feeling he couldn't name.

But in the end, he said nothing and walked out.

Maybe out of guilt, for the next few days, Benjamin came to the hospital every day, staying for half an hour each time.

If this had been before, Rosalie would've been overjoyed. But now, it just felt like a cruel joke.

Chapter 5

Rosalie stayed in the hospital for a week. The day she was discharged, she accepted a friend's invitation to a private party.

She didn't expect to run into Cassandra there.

When Cassandra saw her, she gave a faint, mocking smile and walked over holding two glasses of wine.

""Rosa, I'm sorry about what happened a few days ago. Benny just cares about me too much. This drink is my apology; consider it me making up for him.""

Rosalie didn't want to deal with her and turned to leave, but Cassandra stopped her.

Cassandra leaned in close, her whisper in Rosalie's ear sounding downright cruel.

""Rosalie, don't you think you're like a dog begging for scraps? No matter how hard you try, Benny will never look your way.""

Rosalie's gaze turned cold. She shoved Cassandra hard and snapped back.

""If I'm a dog, then what are you? A widow sleeping with her ex-husband's brother while pregnant with her ex's child?""

Cassandra's face darkened instantly.

Then, for some reason, she suddenly threw her drink on her own face, slapped herself hard, and dropped to her knees in front of Rosalie.

""I'm sorry, Rosa. Everything that happened before was my fault. But I'm carrying Joseph's baby now. Please, I'm begging you, don't make me drink.""

Rosalie froze. Before she could react, someone grabbed her arm tightly and shoved her hard.

Crash.

Caught off guard, she was thrown against a nearby coffee table.

Cups and bottles shattered, splashing wine across her face and clothes.

Several glass shards pierced her palm, blood spilling out. The sharp pain made her vision blur.

As Benjamin shoved her, he carefully helped Cassandra up, his face colder than ice.

""Rosalie, have I spoiled you too much? How dare you treat Cassie like that!""

Rosalie struggled to stand, looking up quietly into Benjamin's cold, merciless eyes.

They had been together for three years. She had wished countless times that he'd touch her just once, without caring about his obsession with cleanliness.

That day finally came, but only so he could hurt her.

She bit her lip until she tasted blood and spoke in a trembling voice.

""Benjamin, after all this time, so in your eyes, I'm nothing but a horrible woman.""

A flicker of doubt flashed in Benjamin's eyes.

Cassandra's heart skipped, and she quickly forced a weak smile. ""Forget it, Benny. I don't think Rosa meant it. She just got carried away by jealousy for a moment. After all...""

Looking at Cassandra's teary face, Benjamin's hesitation vanished. His gaze toward Rosalie turned ice-cold.

""You love me so much that there's nothing you wouldn't do. Grab her. She slapped Cassie once, so give her 20 back. She needs to learn a lesson.""

1pphmnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1pphmnl/does_she_seem_interested_and_should_i_ask_her_out/,Does she seem interested and should I ask her out?,"Hi everyone, I need some advice. This might be a long post, but I’d really appreciate any feedback.

**As a guy, I understand that just because a girl is nice, it doesn’t necessarily mean she’s interested. But hear me out.**

I met a girl at a volunteer place. I’m a volunteer, and she works part-time as a barista at the coffee shop there. I see her every weekend. We’re 7 years apart—I just turned 27 and she’s 20. Is that weird? I figured since we’re both in our 20s, it shouldn’t be.

Lately, I’ve really been enjoying our conversations. One thing that stands out is how engaging she is. Since there aren’t many customers, I’ll often stand at the counter and we’ll talk for 3–5 minutes, sometimes even 10. We talk about our week, our day, things going on in our lives, holiday plans, etc. She asks questions that keep the conversation going, and when things start to die down, she’ll bring up a random topic to continue it. I do the same, of course. You're probably thinking, she wants tips... Bare in mind that she works at a non-profit organization and she's also not allowed to receive tips.

She also remembers things we talked about before and follows up on them the next time I see her. For example:

* I mentioned doing a strict water fast, and the next week she asked how it was going. That led to her opening up about her mom’s breast cancer diagnosis and how she went vegan to support her.
* I told her about my AI prompt engineering certification, and she asked the following week how it was going.
* She asks if I went to a car show when I come in on Saturdays (I go pretty often).
* When she sees me, she’ll ask if I just got in or if I’ve been there a while.

She also notices my schedule. One time I came in early and she said, “Are you here earlier today?” Another time, after I’d missed a few Sundays, she asked, “You come in on Sundays??”

After Thanksgiving, she asked if I went Black Friday shopping, then excitedly told me—without me asking—that she bought stuff at Sephora because it was 50% off. I thought that was kinda cute, lol.

**Another thing that stood out:** a few weeks ago, I mentioned my sister is visiting from Singapore for Christmas and wants to go to San Francisco. She excitedly said, “I’m from the Bay Area!” She asked if I knew the small city she’s from and mentioned she’d be back in NorCal for Christmas and said “Maybe I’ll see you.”

A couple months ago, she asked me to remind her which church I go to and whether I’m part of any groups (I’m not). She said she knows someone who might go to the same church and be in a group. Does that mean she was thinking about me?

Writing all this out makes me feel like our conversations might be surface-level, but to be fair, she’s at work when we talk. Still, the way she keeps the conversation going is something I’ve never really experienced before.

I’ll admit I’m pretty blind when it comes to signs from girls—my friends tell me that all the time. I’d really love to hear your thoughts from a third-person POV, especially from women.

If you think these are all great signs, how should i proceed? Since I love volunteering there, just in case I face rejection and risk ending up in an awkward situation, what is the best and most casual way to ask her out?

Thanks in advance, and Merry Christmas! 🎄
