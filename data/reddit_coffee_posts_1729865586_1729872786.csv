1gbxyoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/1gbxyoo/suddenly_developed_severe_agoraphobia/,Suddenly developed severe Agoraphobia?,"I’m a 23 year old female that’s always been generally anxious but it was something I thought I had handled at least enough to not need medication. In my youth I had a couple fainting episodes that were due to moments of extreme anxiety. Last month I heard something troubling and immediately got really hot and felt faint. I really didn’t want to pass out in public so I took deep breathes and was able to get through it. Last Saturday I believe I had a panic attack and really thought I might faint, really hot, blurry vision, shaky hands, all that. But when I left the situation, I started to feel better. I didn’t realize initially it was panic, I thought it was my heart or I was feeling woozy for another physical reason. Since that day, every day if I leave the house or even think about leaving the house I get anxious. I’ve gone grocery shopping, to the pharmacy, to get coffee, and tried driving and every time I basically end up feeling like I’m having a panic attack and going to pass out. The fear of feeling faint and passing out just makes the panic worse, it’s a horrible cycle. I’ve never felt like this in my life, it’s only been a week and I’m so scared. I can’t get in with my doctor for another couple weeks and I always wanted to avoid medication if I could but I’ve gone in a blink of an eye from someone who loves doing things out of the house to so overwhelmingly anxious. I’ll keep trying to do things cause I know if I give up, it’ll only make it worse but damn this is hard. ",1,1729872678.0,Agoraphobia,0,1.0,False

However, keeping track of all these places I wanted to visit was becoming chaotic—my bookmarks were overflowing!

For example, I found a blog post on “Top Boutique Hotels in Paris Worth Every Penny” and wanted an easy way to save each location. So I built an app that lets me share any link with it, and it automatically saves each spot on a map, ready for future travel plans.

1gbxydz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/1gbxydz/5_day_itinerary_vegas_to_zion/,5 day itinerary Vegas to Zion,"Just completed a beautiful trip to Zion and thought some future trip planners might be interested in my itinerary. 

Flew into Las Vegas on a red eye and stayed at a hotel near the airport. (This decision was purely to keep cost low.)

**Day 1:** Picked up rental car in the morning and started driving towards Utah. Took the scenic route through Henderson and drove through the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. Did an impromptu hike on the Wetlands trail: 1.3 km 24 mins. 

Stopped at the Valley of Fire State Park. Did the Fire Wave, White Domes, Seven Wonders Loop: 4-5km 1hr 20 minutes. 

Proceeded driving towards Utah. Stopped in St. George for dinner and groceries. 

Checked in Airbnb in Virgin, Utah which was 18 minutes from Zion. Airbnb was called 101 Rancho Grandpa's and I highly recommend. The decision to stay in Virgin was made to keep the budget low but also to stay close to the park. There are numerous options closer or farther away. You need to consider how much driving you want to do each day versus the cost. 

**Day 2:** Headed to Zion National Park after breakfast. Stop at Deep Creek Coffee on route. Hopped on the Shuttle to stop 6 The Grotto. Hike to Scout’s Lookout: 5.8 km 1.5-2 hour. We didn't even try for permits to Angel's Landing. If I did it again, I would have at least tried for the day before lottery. But the view from Scout's Landing was beautiful anyway. 

Took a break and had a snack. From the same shuttle stop took Kayenta Trail to Emerald Pools to Shuttle stop 4: 5 kms 1.5 hours.

Walked back towards visitors centre on the Pa’rus trail (paved and flat). Stopped at the park’s museum. Shuttled to Visitor's Centre. 

Went to Zion Outfitters (located right outside the park, you can walk from the Visitor's Centre easily) and rented gear to do the Narrows the following day.

Has dinner at Wild Thyme Cafe on the way home. Highly recommend. 

  
**Day 3:** Woke up at 6am to get a head start on the day. Headed to Shuttle stop 9 Temple of Sinawava for the Narrows hike. We hiked approx. 10kms and it took us 5+ hours. First we went right at the fork for about 30 minutes and then went back and went left at fork and hiked to floating rock. Glad we started early in the morning because there were tons of the people on the way back heading into the Narrows. 

Took the Shuttle back to the Visitor's Centre and returned our gear to Zion Outfitters. Had a snack and coffee break. The hiked Watchman Trail: 4-5km 1.5 hours. 

Ordered and picked up takeout from Zion Pizza and Noodle on the way back to the Airbnb.

**Day 4:** Started driving back to Las Vegas. Stopped in Arizona on the side of the highway to hike. We found a trail on All Trails called Hamburger Rock. Not sure that it was actually a trail as we had to climb a fence and it was not marked. We walked for about 40 minutes and then got back in the car. 

Once we got to Vegas, we walked around at all the big casinos. Went to Freemont Street. Had dinner at La Mona Rose which was so delicious. 

**Day 5:** Woke up and headed to the spa at Caesar's Palace. It was a Monday and a day pass was $95 USD. We spent 4 hours there in their hot tubs, sauna, steam room, cold plunge, etc. It was the best way to round off the trip. 

Then headed the the airport in the evening and went home. ",1,1729872658.0,ZionNationalPark,0,1.0,False
1gbxy8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1gbxy8p/the_murders_in_my_town_dont_bother_mebut_they/,The Murders in My Town Don’t Bother Me—But They Terrify My Grandma,"I hadn’t seen Grandma in years. So when she invited me to stay with her after hearing I was unemployed and struggling with life, it felt like a good deal.

The first day, she insisted on a tour, showing me around town with evident passion, like she wanted me to fall in love with the place.

By nightfall, I’d picked up a job at the local burger joint. Nothing glamorous, but work is work.

That night, after we had dinner, I put on my jacket and gloves, since the December wind can be punishingly cold, and went for a walk.

It was a habit now, nightly walks after dinner. There was something inexplicably soothing about the experience.

The next morning, we sat down to breakfast. Grandma had the TV on as usual, murmuring about the price of eggs. Then, the news anchor’s voice broke in:

*“...the first reported murder in over a decade here. Victim found dead with severe neck trauma, apparently bled out from a wound to the jugular. No suspects are known at this time.”*

Grandma put down her fork, her face drained of color.

“In this town? Good Lord, what’s this place coming to?”

I sipped my coffee and shrugged.

“Crazy things happen everywhere.”

The next night, I left for my walk as usual. Grandma caught me at the door, she looked sick with concern.

“Are you really going out? After that… after *what* happened?”

“Relax, Grandma. If anyone tries anything, I’ll outrun them. Fastest kid in my school, remember?”

She didn’t laugh, but I left anyway. I liked my walks—wasn’t about to stop just because someone ended up dead.

The following morning, Grandma was munching on her toast, listening to the news anxiously.

*“...yet another body was found early this morning… victim appears to have died from a single neck wound. The pattern is disturbingly similar to the murder reported just yesterday….”*

Grandma looked like she was about to have a fit. I had to calm her down.

By the third morning, I was starting to get used to the police sirens. Grandma, however, was more jittery than ever.

*“...police suspect a serial killer, warning townsfolk to avoid unnecessary outings,”* the news anchor droned on. *“The latest victim’s cause of death: a stab wound in the neck…”*

I paused, the coffee cup halfway to my lips.

A stab wound?

She murmured something about wanting me to skip my walks for a while, and I nodded absentmindedly.

That night, I waited for Grandma to get to bed, before I slipped out for my walk. The streets were as empty as ever.

Then, I saw him—a figure standing in the alley, hood up, knife in hand.

The second he saw me, he darted forward, knife raised.

I dodged his first swipe, drove my fist into his gut. His grip loosened, and I felt the cool handle of his knife slip into my own hand.

I sliced his jugular.

1gbxxzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1gbxxzs/discover_the_joy_of_modern_living_new/,Discover the Joy of Modern Living: New Construction Homes in Los Angeles County,"Los Angeles County is a dream destination for countless individuals and families seeking a new chapter in their lives.

From energy-efficient appliances and smart home technology to spacious floor plans and community clubhouses, modern construction homes are designed to make everyday living comfortable, convenient, and highly enjoyable.

Finding the right neighborhood in Los Angeles County is an adventure in itself.

Imagine living in a community where tree-lined streets connect to bustling local farmers’ markets, eclectic coffee shops, and charming parks.

Imagine stepping into a home where every corner feels designed just for you, with ample natural light, high ceilings, and an airy feel that makes every day more enjoyable. Choosing a newly built home means a brand-new beginning, free from the maintenance concerns that come with older properties.

**Benefits of Owning a New Construction Home in Los Angeles County**

If you’re still considering whether a new construction home is right for you, it’s worth taking a closer look at the unique benefits these properties have to offer. Below, we discuss some key advantages that will make the decision even easier.

**1. Customization Options**

One of the most exciting parts of purchasing a newly built home is the chance to customize it according to your tastes. Many builders allow homebuyers to select different finishes, appliances, and layouts to create a home that is truly tailored to their needs. From choosing the kitchen countertop style to deciding on the color scheme for your rooms, customizing your home adds a personal touch that can’t be replicated.

**2. Modern Technology and Energy Efficiency**

Today’s new construction homes incorporate the latest technology, from smart thermostats and security systems to advanced lighting controls. Moreover, these homes are built with energy efficiency in mind, utilizing sustainable materials and technologies that help lower utility bills and reduce your carbon footprint. Energy-efficient features such as solar panels, LED lighting, and water-saving fixtures not only add comfort but also help you save money in the long run.

**3. Lower Maintenance Costs**

One major advantage of buying a newly constructed home is the significantly reduced maintenance costs. Since everything in the home is brand new—from the roof to the appliances—it’s unlikely you’ll need to worry about major repairs or replacements for several years. This allows you to focus more on enjoying your new home rather than spending time and money on maintenance.

**4. Modern Amenities and Lifestyle**

New construction communities in Los Angeles County often come with an abundance of lifestyle amenities, such as pools, parks, gyms, and recreational spaces. Many neighborhoods have been designed to promote active, social living, with walking paths, community centers, and green spaces that encourage interaction and outdoor activities. Living in a neighborhood with such amenities enhances the overall quality of life and fosters a sense of community among neighbors.

**5. Safety and Quality Assurance**

Homes built today are subject to stricter safety standards compared to older homes, ensuring that they meet the latest building codes and regulations. This means that new construction homes are built with safety as a priority, providing peace of mind for you and your family. Additionally, new homes often come with builder warranties, which provide added protection for major components like plumbing, electrical systems, and the structure itself.

**6. Designed for Modern Living**

Today’s home designs reflect the way people want to live. Open floor plans, large kitchen islands, home offices, and abundant storage are some of the features that define modern homes. These layouts are versatile and offer the flexibility needed for today’s lifestyle. Whether it’s working from home, entertaining guests, or creating a comfortable space for the entire family, new construction homes are designed to accommodate a wide range of activities.

**Choosing the Perfect Neighborhood in Los Angeles County**

Los Angeles County is home to an eclectic array of neighborhoods, each with its unique charm and personality. Whether you’re looking for a community that offers serene, suburban tranquility or one that captures the lively, urban vibe, there is a neighborhood for everyone.

**1. The Suburban Charm**

For families or individuals looking for a quiet and peaceful environment, suburban neighborhoods such as those found in the San Fernando Valley or cities like Santa Clarita offer an ideal setting. These communities are known for their family-friendly atmosphere, excellent schools, and abundance of parks. Suburban neighborhoods provide a relaxed pace of life while keeping you close enough to enjoy the excitement of Los Angeles.

**2. The Urban Excitement**

On the other hand, if you enjoy the vibrant energy of an urban lifestyle, neighborhoods closer to downtown Los Angeles are perfect. Downtown offers cultural attractions, world-class dining, entertainment, and a bustling nightlife. Areas such as Silver Lake and Echo Park bring together the best of LA’s artistic and bohemian side, with trendy cafes, independent boutiques, and scenic views. New construction homes in these urban areas offer easy access to everything the city has to offer.

**3. Coastal Living**

Los Angeles County is famous for its beautiful coastline, and neighborhoods near the beach offer a truly idyllic lifestyle. Areas like Malibu, Santa Monica, and Manhattan Beach provide stunning ocean views and a laid-back atmosphere that appeals to those who love the water. Imagine being able to walk to the beach, feel the sea breeze, and enjoy the sunset over the Pacific—it’s a lifestyle that many can only dream of.

**Making the Move to a New Construction Home**

Deciding to invest in a new construction home in Los Angeles County is an exciting journey, filled with opportunities to create the lifestyle you’ve always wanted. Whether you’re drawn to the energy-efficient features, modern amenities, or the chance to live in a vibrant community, new construction homes have something to offer everyone.

Take time to explore the different neighborhoods and find the one that suits your lifestyle and preferences. Each community in Los Angeles County has its distinct character, and there is truly something for everyone—from the coastal charm of Malibu to the urban pulse of downtown Los Angeles. Consider your priorities—whether it’s proximity to work, schools, or recreational activities—and choose the neighborhood that best fits your needs.

**Tips for a Successful New Home Purchase**

1. **Work with an Experienced Real Estate Agent** A knowledgeable real estate agent who understands new construction properties can be a valuable asset during the buying process. They can provide insights into the best developments, negotiate on your behalf, and guide you through the purchase process.
2. **Research Builders** Not all builders are the same. It’s essential to do your homework and research the builder’s reputation, previous projects, and customer reviews. A builder with a strong track record will give you confidence that your home will be constructed to high standards.
3. **Understand Your Options** New construction homes often come with various options and upgrades. Make sure you understand what is included in the base price and what upgrades are available. It’s also helpful to understand how these options will impact the final cost of your home.
4. **Consider the Future** Think long-term when buying a home. A new construction home is an investment, so it’s important to consider how your needs may change over time. Will you need more space for a growing family? Do you plan to work from home in the future? Choose a floor plan that offers the flexibility to accommodate your changing needs.
5. **Look at the Community Amenities** New construction communities often offer fantastic amenities like parks, fitness centers, and swimming pools. Take time to visit the community and explore the amenities to determine if they align with your lifestyle.

**Enjoying Life in Los Angeles County**

There is no shortage of things to do and see in Los Angeles County. From world-famous attractions like the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Universal Studios to lesser-known gems such as hidden hiking trails and local street art, there is always something new to discover.

Ms A.P.
I’m sorry for the way I acted, I should have come in on that scheduled day for treatment but instead I reacted to your text message like a fool not considering that text messages are devoid of feelings. There’s no fool like an old fool they say, whoever “they are”.

I have looked for you on unsent messages and letters etc hoping to find a small note from you. 

But I’m not deserving of a note. 

I wanted to take our connection to a different setting as I had no small amount of affection for you.  Love comes through knowledge and understanding a person and we did not know each other very well outside the realm of treatments. 

I was awaiting your response to my request to meet for coffee or a glass of wine perhaps to begin understanding what our connection was in the chakra world something I had never experienced with any other woman. 

But I’m not sure that you would be interested and I’ve been good not txting you as you requested but I’ve wanted to as thoughts of you have begun to lodge themselves in my mind and heart these past few weeks unrelentingly.

December 28th marks the day that you requested radio silence. 

The words here on Reddit as I look for you span from I hate you to I love you.

I wonder where your words would fall when you think of me.

I’ve not blocked you on my phone and never will.  As we promised that we would never ghost each other, but I did say I couldn’t go backwards in our relationship as I exposed my feelings with asking you to meet outside of the treatment room.

Even if you would like to simply berate and criticize and tell me what a bastard I am I would still like to hear your voice.  And face to face please.

So looking for my phone to light up with your number but ? 

As I see a full moon or make Irish soda bread or molasses cookies I will think of you and how you didn’t share the cookies which still makes me smile. 

We might have been Bogie and Bacall but you were and are a high quality person which is rare and precious.  We’ve known each other for a few years and you know I was in a dark place and lonely and I really wanted you in my life but I no longer wanted to be a client.

So now I’m rambling, fumbling, and trying to reconcile my feelings as I reread your last text message to me vs what passed between us. 

I’m missing a part of me now so I will limp around invisible to everyone but you.

Take care, yes my back is much better cello and guitar work is somewhat satisfying.  

But I can relate to the song “I’m so scared of my guitar.” As you can’t fool the instrument and neither can I fool you, after all I’m just a stupid man.

I will fight no more forever, there’s but one life so the only next time is in the here and now.

Please txt or call?

She has no agenda.

She wounds you, but you live.

You recover, but you are forever marked.

Sometimes your scar is visible, most times it isn’t. But it’s always there, nudging you when you least expect it.

The sound of a storm. Entering a dark room. An empty refrigerator. A flower blooming when it shouldn’t. A dirty shirt worn through with holes lying on the floor next to muddy boots and torn jeans.

Little things remind you that you couldn’t escape, that you endured the pain day after day, after day, after day, until you wanted to scream. Stop! No more!

But it doesn’t stop.

Until it does.

Leaving you grateful for so many things.

The crisp smell of the chilly fall air. The stunning color of trees as they prepare to discard their leaves. Birds flying high, headed south for the winter. Cozier slippers, a crackling fireplace, and freshly brewed coffee that tastes as if meant for a king. A stunning sunset spreads its glory over piles of ruined household goods left on the sidewalk. A child’s broken toy brings tears to your eyes. You take a snapshot with your soul.

Slowly you heal. The scar left behind is one of the many fine lines your limited time on Earth etches into your soul. The elegant pattern it creates in your divine spirit leaves you kinder and more insightful.

Stronger.

Better prepared for the next thing Earth hurls at you.

And she will.

I’ve only recently started to realize the long-term pattern in my life regarding how hard it is for me to let people into my life. I don’t mind grabbing coffee or having good conversations once in a while, but as soon as people start texting or calling often, I feel extremely anxious and want to pull away. The only time this isn’t the case is if I have romantic feelings for someone. At most, I have 1-2 close relationships at a time. Any more than that, I have no capacity for. 

This pattern has led to me being very socially isolated and, I’m sure, come across as me not being a very good friend. But, the anxiety I have when people like me and want to get closer is just so intense. It feels like they want something from me. Like my protective walls are being attacked. And yet, I crave connection. It’s all very painful and confusing.

I was 28 at the time, I previously dated Jackson* in the final year of high school until the early twenties, we both wanted different things in life and I moved interstate for a work opportunity. 

After a few years interstate and a failed engagement of my own, I moved back home, by this time, Jackson * was doing quiet well with himself, I would always look at his socials and notice the lavish lifestyle he was living, traveling the world, buying new cars etc etc, we still had a lot of mutuals and close friends from high school and I was told that he co-owned a successful crypto business with another guy we grew up with. 

Anyway, one night after a few too many drinks, I followed him on instagram, I immediately regretted it and unfollowed a few minutes later but he must’ve seen the request because when I woke up the previous morning I had a message from him asking how I was doing, he had heard that I was back and he’d love to see me. I thought this was strange at the time because I did notice a girl on his instagram, maybe they were just friends? 

A few days later we organised to meet at a bar in the city, I was a few minutes late and nervous as all hell when I walked in and noticed him sitting at a table on the balcony with a girl, he saw me and waved to come over, I didn’t know what to think, I was a bit annoyed and perplexed as to why he didn’t think to let me know beforehand, he introduced us both and told me they were engaged and had the wedding planned for early next year, I remember being intimidated by Chloe* at first, she was stunning, if I remember correctly she was Polish or definitely Eastern European, she kept only using pet names for me like honey, darling etc which made me a bit uncomfortable initially, the night went without drama and Jackson * booked me an Uber home. Deep down I was jealous, I was thinking of what could’ve been, I was also half expecting them to invite me back to their house so part of me was also left wandering and confused as to why he reached out and what the point of dinner and bringing his fiancé along was. 

I wasn’t working at the time and Jackson* jokingly (well I thought anyway) offered me a job being their housekeeper, I previously had a 6 figure salary, diploma and owned my own home, I wasn’t going to be cleaning… especially the house or my ex boyfriend and his new girl! 

A few days later he texted again on instagram and said how lovely it was to see me, that he missed me and still cared about me, he wanted to meet for a coffee privately the next morning, I asked him if Chloe* knew about it and he said yes she’ll be fine. 

It was at this coffee when everything changed and within 2 weeks I was living with both them in a BDSM arrangement, it lasted for 6 months and I was able to get myself out of some financial troubles, I did enjoy parts of it and other parts made me feel a bit vulnerable and emotionally drained, I wouldn’t change my experience but I am happy to have moved on, I blocked both of them on all socials and haven’t had any contact since. 

TL;DR : I spent roughly 6 month as a live in BDSM sex slave to my ex boyfriend and his fiancé ",0,1729872174.0,relationships,2,0.4,False

1gbxped,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepAuthors/comments/1gbxped/will_my_short_story_fit_the_guidelines/,Will my short story fit the guidelines?,"I have a a story I’ve been working on for some time and was wondering if this fits the NoSleep Guidelines. It’s still a work in progress and I have several chapters ready for release. The idea is a new home owner finds a pile of papers, journals, etc, that tells harrowing events of the previous home owners experience. Since the story is a bit of a mess, the home owner has to spend time piecing together everything thus why it releases in segments (several posts). The story takes place with the previous owner suffering from nightmares that are eerily realistic, but upon waking up nothing happened - except for a few random missing items or events. 



First part of my story:

The Previous Homeowners Journals

""Hello everyone, I recently purchased a new home home. It was newly renovated and in a prime location. As my family and I moved in, I came across a notepad, some of those school styled notebooks, and several sticky notes. As I began to read through the scattered notes, I noticed they told a story; some areas felt rushed, and some writing was hard to read, so it might take me awhile to actually piece the story together. I admit I can’t help but feel like it actually happened, guess this guy was a decent author. It’s all a mess though, probably a lot of writing was in the writer’s spur of the moment, doesn’t help that they moved in a rush, they left a lot of other crap behind. But if they were authors … Well maybe it’s not fair to say, but the agent told me the previous owners were an electrical engineer and a school counselor, not exactly author material. We never got to meet the sellers at closing; they apparently had already left the state. We never even learned their names either, just that they’re the Rivera’s.

Anyway, I'll be releasing the story as I compile it. Let me know what you think and uhh, if you think you know the authors let me know! I’ll love to give them their work back, anyway here it is!""

Chapter 1: The Dream

My cheeks twitched slightly as the black haze started to lift from my sleeping mind. A soft groan left my throat as I stretched my neck to a more comfortable position. I heard my wife moving as well, the comfortable swish and pull of the sheets. The noise kept emanating and waking me up more fully. “Are you okay?” I mumbled, putting my arm around her. My waking ears twitched as the sound of this unknown noise grew more precise. It was a soft shuffling sound, one that I initially thought was my wife going to the bathroom.I gently wrapped my arms around my wife’s warm frame tighter.

My eyes jutted open, and my body tensed; I felt my skin crawl as my brain shocked itself awake. My mind began spinning with realization—if she was shuffling to the bathroom, our master bathroom is right there, not much of a long walk... And she's laying right next to me. In my arms. My ears zoned in. Was this a mouse? An animal? Why isn't our dog making a noise? This wasn't a mouse—it wasn't any kind of small animal! I'm not exactly an expert in sounds, but I know well enough that this noise is not animalistic—and it is searching.

After a few seconds, I realized we were being burglarized.

We live in a ranch-style house; my wife and I are first-time homeowners and have been living here for five months. Everything is just about open-concept, and the living room is a short walk from our master bedroom. Our community is very quiet and suburban, something we love since we moved out of the noisy city of Philadelphia. While we've become familiar with different sounds from the city, we also adjusted quickly to the silence of suburbia. Admittedly, most sounds breaking the silence tend to scare us, and our refrigerator loves popping out random ice cubes like mini gunshots.

And now I heard what sounded like shuffling in the living room.

The creak and groan matched with constant slow footsteps, someone was searching around for something that kept eluding them by moving short distances. I heard the pillows on the couch bump around and the coffee table move. My heart started to pound heavily, and I felt a tightness around my chest.

Slowly, and as quietly as possible, I leaned over to my nightstand and opened it to grab my handgun. As panic continued to swell in my chest, my wife started shifting and waking up, whether due to me or the intruder I don't know, and I quickly shushed her with my hand over her mouth. She's feisty and immediately gave me an angry look, probably more upset to be jarred awake. She motioned to speak, until she noticed the gun in my hand. I put on sweatpants slowly and quietly and unlocked the bedroom door. I carefully opened the door, leaving it slightly ajar to avoid making noise, and made my way down the hallway. My wife stood sitting in bed on her phone, probably calling the police.

In hindsight, I should have stood in the bedroom and let the police handle this situation. What an idiot.

My heart was pounding hard as the warm sensation of blood rushed to my face. Growing up in the city, I found myself in many dangerous situations, but I never could have realized how much more terrifying it can be having an intruder in your home. As I crept closer, I saw the hunched back of a figure wearing a black tank top and baggy black shorts. My coffee table blocked the view from his calves down. The figure had pale white skin, seemingly Caucasian, maybe even albino, and its bent-over frame had its hands in the crevices of my couch. It wore either a tight black beanie or maybe it had a thick buzzcut; the distance was too far to be certain. I wondered what it expected to find in my couch; certainly it wasn't looking for dust bunnies or loose change.

Slowly walking closer, I aimed my firearm at the intruder; the floor creaked under me. He stood up quickly, startled, his head whipping in my direction to look directly at me, as the rest of him slowly turned around. As he turned, everything about him seemingly shifted, almost shimmering in the light streams through the bay window blinds, as if he was made out of fine silver-colored sand. His pale skin tone shimmered to a tan tone, and a tattoo morphed on his chest and arms, mimicking the same tattoos on my upper body. I froze, staring at my doppelganger. His body was no longer albino in a black outfit, but instead was shirtless, wearing sweatpants, with my messy bed head and hairline—and holding something...

I faced myself. I was holding a firearm, and he was holding what I perceived to be a firearm, but something about it looked off. I took a step. He—I?—took a step. I walked toward him. He did the same. I stopped a short distance away, and he mimicked me. My chest pounded as my reflection's face grew slightly red. I can only imagine that was how I looked. My breathing was calm yet heavy. So was his, but without the sound of breaths being taken. I took a step backward, and aimed at him, and he mimicked each movement until he backed into the coffee table and fell.

I took this opportunity and fired off six bullets into him, five making their mark. I almost feared I might feel the pain myself.

My wife ran down the hall to see the scene unfolding. “Please tell me you're seeing what I'm seeing,” I pleaded. My wife confirmed my sanity. “Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, what the hell is that? What the hell is this? What is going on?”

“CALM DOWN,” my mirror image screamed, and I fired two more rounds into him.

The silence stood heavy in the air.

“That was not your voice,” my wife stated, as we watched blood pour out of him—more like sand flowing out of a vial than liquid. My body lurched forward as my name, “CASSIAN!”screamed out. My neck was punctured by two rows of teeth, and my doppelganger was standing back up.

Fear immediately struck my heart as I went to grab the being behind me and—BEEP BEEP BEEP—my morning alarm was going off. My heart was pounding, my body soaked in sweat. My wife groaned, “Turn off the alarm, Cassian.” I turned off the alarm and stood up—the pounding in my chest dissipating as I realized that all I went through was a vivid dream. I checked the magazine to my firearm and counted fifteen bullets. All is well… Just a horrible dream. I went to the bathroom, washed my face, and wrote every detail I remembered down as my wife woke up. I began telling my wife, Selene, about the dream as I jotted it down in my brown notepad. Reliving it through speech actually helped with jotting everything down.

“That's got to mean something; maybe we should play the lottery?” Selene joked as she went to shower.

Ahh Selene, she believes in astrology, she believes in mythical things, and that rocks and essential oils can influence a person or put them to sleep, but she won’t believe me.

We got prepared for work. I normally work remotely, but today I was heading down to Philadelphia for a survey. As I put my coat on and made my way toward the kitchen to make my morning coffee before heading to my car, I decided to take a moment and stare into the living room. Everything looked utterly normal. Nothing changed. No evidence of an attack.

Nothing.



Until something shiny caught my eye…

""And that, my friends, is what he has written down on the first page of this notebook. The next pages seem to be notes jotted down for an office in 16th and Market Street, no idea where that’s at though. If you'd like to hear more of this story, let me know; I think it's kind of creepy because I can personally visualize it a bit since, ya know, I live here.""

Edit: ""Hey, I decided to peek around the living room, and I noticed a hole in the floor - it looks to be patched by some wood putty and revarnished. Maybe I’m being paranoid, but could bullet holes be that easy to fix? I never owned a firearm. Maybe it’s actually just a knot in the wood and I’m being paranoid, I don't know; let me know what you think.""

(and Reddx if this story is good enough for AdSents) I have been wanting to share this arc from a few years back for some time. With some hard recollection and a copious amount of snooping on social media, I believe I have pieced together a readable story for your enjoyment.  Cringe for the Cringe God Reddx and all that.

I apologize, English is my first language and I can barely speak it. This story is very gross, it churned my stomach to remember and write the horrors I observed during this time and I would not recommend eating while reading or listening to this tale. Take a tum or drink some pepto bismol if you start feeling queasy.

Cast list:

Bogica- 5 ft nothing ""curvy"" girl who had a dream of being queen of the nest. By far the most disgusting person I have ever encountered.

 Nerdina- Methan's lady love of around 4 years, loved to laugh.

 Methan- Former meth addict, working his way up the Mcdonald's ladder.

Weevil- Good friend of Brick, nice enough, hardworking redneck-nerd hybrid.

Boots- Bogica's Bf at the start of this story. Named Boots because he needs to be given the boots, extreme style. If he doesn't seem bad in this story, he really wasn't until what I found out he was doing years later as explained in the Where Are They Now? segment at the end of this story.

Brick- My boyfriend at the time of this story. Shorter than me by a few inches but built like a brick house. ""Lift heavy things make depression go bye bye."" A kind soul, nerdy with a penchant for getting sad drunk every day. Worked at a panini restaurant during the duration of this story.

OP/Goob- Cripplingly insecure at this time with a noticeable lack of a back bone. The word ""no"" lived in the farthest reaches of my vernacular, now covered in cobwebs and emaciated from neglect.

Others are not an integral part of this story, but they make appearances, so no further description for them.

This story takes place when I am 18-19, and like many in that age range of new found independence, I was a total dipshit. At this time, I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship and immediately rebounded, as codependent types are want to do, with a friend and sometimes fling from high school, Brick. Instead of dealing with my most recent of trauma, I coped with an alcohol dependency bordering on addiction. I became an observer to my life instead of an active participant. ""I'll just stuff it all down and one day I'll die"" was my motto for this time in my life.  It took me longer than I'd like to admit to realize I, and I alone, have the power to take control of my life. No one is gonna live it for me. I include this peek into my sordid past to answer the question of ""...Why?"". I'm also a glutton for free entertainment. But you didn't come here to hear about lil old me, lets dive into the legbeard nest!

The day started like any other, the sun was shining, the birds were chirping. I was getting ready to meet Brick's friends for a night of drinking and mtg. I was excited to meet everyone, having no friends of my own, I craved myself some good old fashioned human interaction. Once he had arrived home from work and got changed out of his panini smelling uniform, we soon boot scoot and boogied our way out the door and into his 2000 Subaru Outback. ""You don't have to be nervous."" Brick assured me as we pulled out of my trailer park. ""They're all nice people, you'll like them."" ""I just hope they'll like me."" I responded as I fiddled with the small bluetooth speaker sitting on the dash. Soon enough, the depressing reality that Andrew Jackson Jihad brings began playing out of it. ""They will, don't you worry about that. Once everyone has some drinks in them it will get easier to talk."" Truer words never spoken, alcohol is the best social lubricant.

We drove though the narrow, pothole ridden roads of downtown Collegeville, windows down to help mitigate the lack of air conditioning. Passing an equal amount of tweakers huddled under the doorsteps of businesses and over dressed gaggles of girls waiting in line to enter clubs. Crossing over a bridge we soon pulled on to a quiet side street. Brick eased the car to a stop next to a curb, the breaks squealing with indignation. ""We're here."" he said as he cut the engine. I could almost hear the sigh of relief emanating from under the hood. ""Can you grab my cards from the bag in the trunk? I'll bring the beer in."" The keys to the brokemobile were tossed into my lap as he hopped out, stretching his shoulders and back from a long day of making sammies. Unlocking the trunk, I fished around past empty fast food bags and crumpled monster cans to find the black backpack containing the cardboard crack. He hoisted up a 30 rack from the back seat and I handed the keys back to Brick to lock up. ""I built you a deck, once we settle down I'll teach you the basics."" He said as we started walking down the side walk. ""It's just up here, the yellow one."" I started to take in my surroundings. A three story pale yellow house loomed behind a group of pine trees. As we drew closer to the moss and mold accented home, I could see how close to the edge of a sharp drop the house was. A bad year of erosion would cast it tumbling down to join the piles of used needles and trash littering the river below. If only we were all so lucky.

It was a beautiful afternoon. Around 65 degrees with a warm breeze that washed away the stink of the city. But there was something sinister on the wind as we approached the door. Stale cigarettes, BO, and... is that a hint of unwashed ass I detect? Brick swung the wooden door open, a few flies fleeing to a better life flew past us. I stepped into the light of a kitchen. The smell hit me before my eyes had a chance to take in my surroundings. Cigarettes, stale and freshly lit acted as a mask for the more grotesque smells of cat urine, mold and the sickly sweet scent of garbage that should have been brought to the curb a month ago. My eyes broke out of the thousand yard stare the stench elicited and I took a scan of the kitchen. A mountain of dishes sat in and around what I assumed to be a sink, fully obscuring were it may be. Counters cluttered with more crusty dishes, liquor bottles new and empty (but mostly empty), take out bags, ash trays and unopened utility bills. Brick made some room on the counter for the beer by pushing the empty liquor bottles out of the way, seemingly unfazed by the destitution. Several were stuck to the counter by an unknown sticky substance and required some elbow grease for removal. My gaze moved to the floor, or the little I could see of it. Huge black trash bags overflowing with cans, 2 liters and take out boxes leaning against walls and cabinets. A tower of pizza boxes standing sentry to the left of the door. The laminate floor held the remnants of food, cat litter and hair. My mind was somewhere far away when I was broken out of my trance by Brick saying ""Shut the door, I don't want the cats getting out."" I quickly swung the door shut and stepped off the welcome mat, noticing a spiraling wooden staircase partially obscured by a hanging tapestry to my right. Taking a few steps closer to Brick, my boots slightly stuck to the floor with each movement.

""Hey guys! We're here!"" Brick projected into the adjacent living room. He strode in to join the group sitting around on several desiccated couches. A chorus of ""Hey dude!"" and other greetings accented the slapping of hands in the process of dapping up each other. I paused at the entrance to the room, not able to take in any more visual information now that I was in the presence of the strangers I was to talk to all night. Brick plopped on to one of the couches, picking up a grinder to prepare some devils lettuce for consumption. I stepped closer to the collective and gave a smile to the faces looking up at me. ""Guys this is my girlfriend, Goob"" Brick introduced, ""Goob, this is Methan, Methan's Girlfriend Nerdina, Weevil, Boots, Man Bun, and Lil Fella."" He gestured to each in turn. Once the introductions were complete I gave another smile with a ""Hey, nice to meet you guys."" ""Can you put my cards on that table?"" Brick motioned to a fold out table sitting in the back of the living room where others had placed their own cases of expensive picture rectangles. I strode over to the table, the sticky spots on my boots now coated with dirt and detritus, becoming effectively immune to sticking to the scraped wooden floor. I set the card case on the table next to the others, wiping my clammy hands on my pants. I returned to the group were Brick patted the empty couch cushion next to him. A plume of dead skin cells and hair escaping into the air with the force. Despite my want to avoid contracting diseases unknown to man, I acquiesced and sat daintily on the edge.

""Goob you remember Weevil right?"" Brick gestured to a skinny, tall guy sitting on the couch across from us, ""We were on the wrestling team together in high school."" ""Oh yeah, hey man how have you been?"" I asked Weevil. He had dark brown hair, a beaked nose and sad looking, slightly sunken in eyes accented by an old scar lining his cheek. ""I've been okay, just working at coal mining company mostly."" he responded in a quiet, slightly shaky voice. He rested his well broken in shit kickers up on a stained ottoman as Brick passed him the bowl. The two started talking amongst themselves as I took the opportunity to look at my surroundings, observing the people around me.

Man Bun, a well built guy with his light brown hair pulled back in a bun was sunk into one of the couches. His eyes looked perpetually squinted like he was high, come to think of it he may have just been perpetually high. He was playing RDR2 on one of the many tvs in the living room. He was chatting with Lil Fella, a very short and chubby man with long, partially dyed curly hair sitting next to him.  In front of the pair sat a pickle rick bong that looked like it hadn't ben cleaned out since the infamous episode aired a year and some change prior. In the corner, a rather rotund man with greasy blond hair was hunched in front of a monitor playing Monster Hunter. Boots had his back to the group, seemingly enthralled by whatever creature he was slaying. Methan and Nerdina were huddled together watching a Youtube video on a laptop, (probably trash since it wasn't Reddx) giggling at the screen. Nerdina was cute with a melodious laugh, maybe a little chubby, with big ol mommy honker donkers. As I looked towards towards Methan at her side, I wondered then what she saw in him. He was skinny as a twig, a bony face with beady eyes framed by a mop of greasy hair. It looked like it had once been dyed green, but now taking on the color of moldy bread. As he laughed at the video, I caught a glimpse of his teeth. Several were missing or rotted away into stumps, think Gollum's teeth but in varying stages of decay. My own teeth clenched in fear that the spreading black and green sludge that lived in his fetid maw would infect them just by the sight.

Feeling awkward and needing some reprieve from the biohazard couch, I asked Brick, ""I'm gonna grab a beer, do you want anything?"" ""Yeah, can you make me a jack and coke?"" He responded in between coughs. ""Jacks on the counter, cokes in the fridge, and uhh.. there should be a glass in the cupboards."" ""Sure thing babe."" I said as I stood. I was worried my black jeans had taken up the couch's mantle of containing the essence of many asses. Dusting myself off I returned to the kitchen. I cracked open and quickly downed my first beer of the night, pulling out a second and setting it on the counter I commenced the hunt for the ingredients of Brick's drink. I quickly located the bottle of Jack Daniels and set it next to my beer. Swinging the fridge open I saw a 2 liter of coke amongst a litany of old food in tupperware containers. As I picked it up, I paused. Behind where the coke had sat, there was a vacuum sealed package. The sticker on the package described what cut of steak was within and a best by date of 5 months ago. I then noticed the bubbles. Amidst the liquid that was once a pretty nice cut, bubbles slowly formed, rose, and dissipated. Whatever bacteria infested the ancient steak were producing a gas byproduct I assumed. I have never before, nor since, seen a carbonated steak.

Shutting the fridge door in horror, I focused on the remaining task of finding a clean glass. Opening one cabinet after another, my search yielded no fruit. Not a single glass or even coffee mug to be found. A few shot glasses showed themselves, but they would not do. My man wanted a jack and coke, and by god I would make him a jack and coke. My eyes slowly looked to the sink and the mountain of dishes and cutlery. I could see several glasses and mugs under encrusted plates. Peering into the abyss, something was wriggling near the bottom. Swimming in the dark brown goop, white maggots munched away happily on their nutrient paste. Then, an unfamiliar word escaped my lips. ""No"" I squeaked aloud to myself, my voice breaking like a young lad who's jewels had just dropped. As I was preparing to return defeated with a shot glass, I heard the groaning of the wooden staircase behind me. Someone- or something had descended the spiral. I turned to look at the spector behind me. I almost jumped out of my skin in surprise. Peeking out at me from behind the tapestry obscuring the stairs, stood a short girl. Standing sideways on the steps with her back to the wall, she had one hammy fist clenching the fabric aside enough to peer out into the kitchen. I wouldn't have noticed her if it wasn't for her bulbous belly betraying her by poking out past the tapestry. ""Was she trying to hide from me?"" I thought in bewilderment. ""H-hi I'm Goob, Brick's girlfriend."" She stepped out from behind the tapestry slowly and responded quietly, ""Bogica.""

Now that she had stepped into the light of the kitchen, I could get a better look at her.  She had long, stringy box died black hair with bangs, and a large pair of square glasses obscured her small eyes. Pouting thin lips frowned down at her protruding gut. She was shaped like an apple that someone stuck four tooth picks into serving as arms and legs. I believe that this is called a prediabetic body shape by the scholars among us. All her blubber was collected in her gut area, being contained by an over sized my little pony shirt, leaving a flat chest and even flatter ass. Like hank hill but he gained 40 lbs in just his belly. She was looking down, shoulders slumped like a little kid who had just gotten scolded. ""Hey can you help me find a clean glass? I couldn't find any in the cupboards."" I asked, trying to shake off the disgust and surprise in tandem. ""There's plenty in the sink, you can just rinse one out"" She said curtly. ""Yeah.. but I think they're too dirty."" I said in desperation. She sighed, apparently being asked to perform a task had broken her out of... whatever this display was. Waddling over to one of the overfull trash bags, she kicked it out of the way scattering all manner of garbage across the floor. Behind were the trash bag had slumped, she opened a cabinet and reached far back inside, producing a stack of red solo cups. ""That's perfect, thank you so much."" I was so relieved that I would not be peer pressured into touching anything near the primordial goo living in the sink that I almost cried at the sight of those plastic cups. She held the cups out with two hands like a child giving up their favorite toy. ""Hewe"" she said quietly, like she was trying to force a speech impediment to sound childish. ""Thank you, I really appreciate it."" Taking them from her grasp, I noticed her nails. An inch long, but painted an ugly color, I was almost envious for a second. Due to vitamin deficiency, my own nails are short and brittle. That envy quickly faded when I realized she wasn't wearing nail polish. A sickly yellow, almost orange stain coated her claws. A cacophony of black, brown and green was caked under her nails. Looking up in horror, she was already stomping away to the living room. The menfolk now surrounding the fold out table with their decks prepared for a game of addition and subtraction.

Taking off the bottom cup where her grubby paw prints remained, I opted for the next cup up in the stack. Pouring a heavy shot into the bottom, I downed it with a shudder. Finally, I made the requested drink of the man who had knowingly brought me into this nightmare. Grabbing my beer, I brought both back into the living room and joined the babbling at the table. ""Heyyy, there you are, what took you so long?"" Brick asked with a smile, eyes slightly squinting with blood vessels quickly becoming more visible. ""I couldn't find any clean glasses, hey can I talk to you for a second?"" I said quietly. An ""OHHH you're in troubleee"" came from Man Bun, laughing. I motioned to a corner a few feet away with my eyes and Brick followed. ""What's up babe?"" he asked while we were out of ear shot. ""I think.. I think they have a fly problem."" I managed to get out. ""Yeah they're pretty bad here, just ignore them."" He responded. ""I- have you looked in the sink?"" I asked in desperation. ""Hahaha no. I know better than to go near there."" he responded with a chuckle. ""They're just bad at doing dishes, just ignore them if you can. Now come on, Man Bun and Weevil are gonna play, and after I'll teach you once we watch them."" ""Uh.. okay, I'll try."" I said, not wanting to rock the boat. ""Oh, and one more thing. Whats with that girl?"" I gestured to Bogica, holding out a palm in expectation to Boots, who was still consumed by Monster Hunter. He reached into his pocket with a grunt and produced a pack of cigarettes, placing them into Bogica's waiting hand. ""She was like, trying to sneak up on me I think. When I introduced myself she acted like I had just caught her stealing something. Does she have something... like mentally?"" ""Oh, Boots's girlfriend? I don't think so, I think she just shy about meeting new people. She's nice when you get to know her, just give her time."" And with that lack luster attempt at reassurance, he returned to his compatriots who had began shuffling. I followed and stood by his side, my rapidly disappearing beer clutched close to my chest.

As the match began, I was told the basics of the what each card did. An info dump of a monstrous proportion came with each land, creature and spell that was slapped on the table. Trying to get a grasp of how the game worked, I didn't notice that Bogica had filled the empty space next to me at the table. ""You're weally tall"" she mused, still in that faux baby voice that made my skin crawl. Caught off guard, I looked down to see her cowering up at me, bulging eyes widened as far as they could, with a lit cigarette in hand. ""Oh uh, yeah. I'm 5'9'', my boots are just big."" I responded hesitantly. 5'9'' is above average for the female species I do suppose, and I have a love of some big ol stompers, so I probably looked like I was almost 6 feet tall. ""Why are you talking like that Bogica? It's creepy."" Man Bun queried as he placed a card. ""I have a speech impediment!"" she shot back angrily, noticeably without replacing any vowels with ""W"". ""Thats about the most selective speech impediment I've ever heard."" Man bun retorted, chuckling. ""Don't distract Goob, she's trying to learn the game."" ""Fine."" she huffed, ""But I want to play her after you're done."" She had dropped the baby voice and replaced it with a gravely whine. ""Suit yourself."" Brick responded, ""But go easy on her, she doesn't know how to play yet."" ""Don't worry, I'll go easy"" she giggled as she scuttled off to the kitchen stairs to grab her deck from somewhere deep in the bowels of the nest.

""Is this game anything like Gwent? I'm good at that game."" I inquired. ""Haha, no. MTG is a lot more complicated than Gwent."" Brick chortled. ""Okay, then I really have no idea what I'm doing. Can you help me?"" I asked. ""Yeah of course! I've been wanting to try out this deck I made, I'll sit by you and help you out."" he responded. I was starting to get the sense that Brick would be the one actually playing and I would be simply holding the cards. Much like when you give your younger sibling an un plugged controller while you play to give them a sense of control. I watched the conclusion of the match, trying to glean whatever information I could to help me do well in whatever legbeard superiority display I was now a part of. An ""Aww fuck man!"" came from Man Bun as Weevil had came out on top. ""Sorry dude, you owe me a 4th."" Weevil said in his quiet, shaky voice, now lined with the satisfaction of a game well won, ""Get packing and I'll put our stuff away."" ""Okay dude but we're sharing tonight, I didn't bring that much for tonight. I'll bring extra next week just for you."" Man Bun conceded, standing up to rejoin his pickle rick bong. A trundling down the rickety stairs announced Bogica's return. Weevil had gathered his and Man Bun's cards and placed them back in their receptacles. ""Tables all yours."" he said as he joined Man Bun on the couch. I sat down in the now free seat as Brick shuffled the cards. ""This is a black deck, with lots of zombies. You'll be using the graveyard as a resource."" ""Black sounds cool."" I still had no idea what the different colors meant, or the mechanics of the game. Bogica plopped down across from me, the vibration from the force shaking the drinks on the table.

""What deck do you have?"" I asked Bogica as her stained fingers molested the cards. ""Oh, I brought my Planeswalker."" she said with a sly smile. Now on the same level, the rotting stench of tonsil stones assaulted my senses. The bacterial nature reserve had left her teeth fuzzy and stained a disconcerting brown-yellow from cigarettes, coffee and neglect. ""What the hell Bogica? I told you to go easy on her!"" Brick exclaimed with annoyance. ""It's fine,"" I consoled, trying to lean back in my seat to remove myself from the poison aoe damage, ""It's just a game, no need to get upset. Let's just start."" he sat down next to me with a sigh, ""Fine, lets just get this over with."" The game began as my suspicions were confirmed, I was meant only to hold the cards for Brick. This was a relief as I don't believe I would be able to concentrate given the wheezing coming from across the small table. ""Play this."" ""Tap these."" he instructed as I shifted uncomfortably.

A few minutes into the match, I was starting to feel light headed from the effort of holding my breath. It was then that Bogica produced a gagging sound. I watched her as she maneuvered her tongue around and lifted her fingers up to her mouth. Reaching in, and pulling out a large tonsil stone. She then squished and rolled around her noxious pearl, playing with it until it had lost its round shape. She sniffed her fingers then wiped the remnants on her my little pony shirt. New white and yellow streaks joined a dozen old ones on the face of that poor pony. Sucking her fingers, she placed another card. I shot up, ""Where's the bathroom?"" ""Can you wait? We're in the middle of the game."" Brick said. ""Just take over for me."" I said taking a few steps away from the horror I had just witnessed. ""No! We're playing!"" Bogica screeched. ""Goobiee sit downnn. Just wait a minute I'm about to win!"" She tried to reach out to grab my arm as I passed, my life flashing before my eyes as I narrowly escaped her clutches. Her malodorous talons grasped the empty air mere inches away from my bare arm. ""I have to go now,"" I said definitively, feeling nausea grip my stomach, ""I'll only be a second."" ""Up the living room stairs and to the right."" Brick said as he took his place in my seat, now looking around to discern the source of the now much stronger miasma. ""Nah, Nerdina is getting ready for work in that one."" Methan said from the couch. ""Bogica can she use yours?"" ""I guess, its across from my room up the kitchen stairs."" She relinquished. ""Just don't touch anything."" ""Thank you."" I made a beeline through the kitchen and to the stairs, ignoring the restickification of my boots from the floor. Once I got beyond the tapestry, I paused for a moment, trying to quell the rising bile in my stomach. ""She's nice,"" he said, ""Just get to know her,"" he said. The words echoed in my mind as I wondered how someone could get this repulsive. They all seemed to ignore it, her and the revolting state of the home. ""Jesus fucking Christ."" I took a deep breath, and climbed the spiraling stairs.

Reaching the zenith of the home, it got noticeably warmer. I cursed the laws of thermodynamics for the now hot and sticky air that rose to the top floor. A narrow hallway with two openings greeted me. Both were lacking doors, instead covered with more tapestries. A wooden door that looked like it had been kicked in a fit of man baby rage leaned next to one of the doorways for emotional support. Pushing aside the dusty fabric, I peered into the first room. I was thankful I had located the bathroom, I had had my fill and more of snooping. There is only so much forbidden knowledge one mortal can consume in an afternoon. The reek of ammonia and cat shit amplified by the heat slapped me in the face. Cat litter crunched under my boots as I walked to the toilet. No toilet seat. Just a ring of yellow-orange piss and shit streaks on what was once a white porcelain throne. The bowl was discolored by pink and black mold and a pallet of every excrement color under the sun. ""God damn it."" My bladder felt like it was about to burst, but I was not about to let my derrière come anywhere near that gaping maw. I pulled a move some m'ladies know well when faced with desecrated public toilets, as laying down toilet paper was not an option in this instance. Pulling down my jeans as far as I could while avoiding them contacting the floor I assumed a standing squat stance. Holding a standing squat alone is difficult for most, but adding into the equation that I had skinny jeans around my ankles, was tipsy AND trying to piss, it was divine intervention that I did not go tumbling into the septic pit. I thanked my history of hunter and jumper training for my strong thighs that day.

After I had finished and pulled my pants back up, I noticed a filthy trash can next to the deep sink. It was overflowing with toilet paper, rusted razors and empty shower products. The toilet paper was streaked with traces of feces, pus, and blood. My unsteady legs walked to the sink as I caught my reflection in the pus and oil splattered mirror. I looked like 10 miles of bad highway. Hair frizzing from the humidity, my makeup I had redone so many times in an effort to make a good impression was now streaked and collected below my eyes. Looking down to find soap to wash my hands I stopped dead in my tracks. A used tampon was left unceremoniously in the sink. Blood deep brown and congealed from age turned my own blood cold. In my attempt to keep my booty clean, my hands were not so lucky. I would not walk around with piss covered fingers, no matter that my company had no problem with walking around with worse. The kitchen sink being inaccessible, I realized in horror that the only way I was to get clean was to get it over with. Eyes watering and throat closing, I grabbed enough toilet paper to wipe the asses of an entire family and carefully picked up the tampon by the very end its string. Suppressing a gag, I unstuck it with a squelch and dropped it in the pile of trash. I shook my hands with visceral disgust and let out a whimper to avoid letting loose the scream rising in my chest. I pumped at the soap bottle desperately, all that was left was thinly collected at the bottom. Unscrewing the bottle, adding a little water and shaking afforded the right viscosity to pour on my shaking hands. I scrubbed until my hands were raw, wishing that I could scrub my brain and eyes the same way. Having nothing but a crusty, stiff towel heaped on the floor as a means to dry my hands, I opted to wipe them on my shirt instead. Taking a corner of my sleeve to wipe the spreading black from my under eye, I rushed back down the creaking steps.

I needed fresh air like a basement dweller needs hentai. I flung open the front door, the cool night air soothing the knot in my gut. Letting out a deep sigh I walked towards the steps connecting the house from the road. I sat heavily on the cracked concrete. ""Cows and pigs have more dignity."" I thought. My eyes stared off towards nothing as I gulped down clean air. My racing thoughts were broken by the front door creaking open. Nerdina stepped out wearing her uniform with a back pack slung around her. She closed the door behind her and she noticed me, ""Jesus you scared me!"" she said with a start. ""What are you doing out here? Brick was asking where you went."" ""Sorry, I was just getting some fresh air."" I explained. ""You doing okay?"" she asked, ""You're not looking so hot."" ""Yeah I'll be fine in a minute, I just have a headache."" ""Ah,"" she said, ""You know, weed usually helps when I have a migraine, I'm sure Man Bun will share. That is if they haven't already smoked it all."" she ended with a laugh. ""Thanks, I'm just gonna sit out here for a bit before I go back in."" ""Okay, well I hope you feel better. Have a nice night."" She patted my shoulder as she climbed the stairs. ""Thanks, have a good night, it was nice to meet you."" I called after her as she approached a brokemobile of her own. I sat on the steps for a while longer until some shots rang out in the distance. I took that as my cue to return to the nest.

Stepping back into the warm light of the kitchen, I was thankful that I had become more nose blind to the stench. Grabbing a solo cup I poured heavily into it and taking a hearty gulp. I did not want to be mentally present for the rest of the night. Chalice in hand I returned to the living room where the party had nestled themselves into the couches. ""Heyy there you are!"" Brick slurred, ""Where'd you run off to?"" ""I needed some air,"" I responded, taking the empty seat next to him. He wrapped an arm around me lazily as I realized he would be in no condition to drive any time soon. ""How'd your game go?"" I asked. ""I got my ass beat,"" he laughed, ""Bogica's Planeswalker sucks."" ""Don't be a sore loser Brickieee."" Bogica cooed from an adjacent couch. Grimacing with disgust, I avoided looking at her and the pony she donned. ""My little sisters love that show."" I thought absently.

Minutes passed as my drink disappeared as I started to feel my body relax into the couch. Boots was still hunched over his monitor, kept company by a two liter of the finest dew. I don't think he had moved the entire night. The passing of the pickle rick bong had commenced once more. Once it got to Brick he took a hit, held his breath and slowly exhaled. Offering it to me with a cough, I took it in hand. I would like to preface this next part with a few things. I used to smoke in high school, not religiously, but I did partake. I had never smoked from a bong before, so I wasn't sure of the right way to go about it. It had been years since I had last smoked, so I had no tolerance whatsoever. At this point, I was certifiably drunk. Copying Brick's motions, I took the lighter in hand and brought it up to the smoldering plant matter. Emptying my lungs I took a deep breath into the receptacle. I did not remove the dongle containing the devils lettuce as someone proficient in huffing grass exhaust would do, so I inhaled much more of the smog than I meant to. I immediately started hacking up a lung. ""God damn! Why didn't you take it off before you breathed in?"" ""I- didn't know- I-"" I sputtered out in between coughs. ""Have a nice trip to space."" Man bun said giving me a salute.

After the coughing had subsided I started to feel my body fill with warmth. I felt something jump on my lap. A skinny orange cat had come out of its hiding place to seek attention. ""Hi little kitty,"" I mumbled. I pet his small head as he rubbed up against me, purring. I noticed that one of his eyes was swollen shut and leaking mucus, most likely from conjunctivitis. ""Poor little cat, you need some antibiotics."" As I scratched his neck I felt various scabs and dirt under his fur. Bogica stomped up and snatched the cat roughly from my lap. ""That's my cat."" she sneered as she squeezed him up against her filthy form. The cat squeaked in protest as she threw herself back in her seat. The moment he could wriggle free, he scampered franticly to safety. ""Deku get back here!"" She screeched clawing after him. I felt something crawling on me then. Looking down, a few black specks scurried around on my bare arms. ""Ah!"" I exclaimed slapping them away. ""Your cat needs to go to a vet, he has an eye infection and he's covered in fleas!"" ""He's fine!"" she shouted, clambering over trash and filth to locate the poor creature.

Standing up so fast I was hit with a massive wave of nausea. I was, as the kids say, crossfaded. ""I'm gonna throw up."" I told Brick. He raised himself and started leading me to Nerdina's bathroom. Her bathroom was not much cleaner than the rest of the house, but at least she had a toilet seat. I spent what felt like an eternity puking more than I have in my entire life. I did not know my body had that much liquid in it, but I parted ways with it all the same. Brick brought me bottles of water and rubbed my back in turns while I expelled my entire stomach. After the self inflicted torture had subsided, I whispered out, ""Can we please leave? Now?"" ""Yeah, let's get you home."" He helped me get to my feet and led me back down the stairs. The living room was quiet as most had passed out on the couches. Helping me towards his car, I slumped in the passenger seat. I don't remember the ride home, but once I felt the car lurch to a stop I perked up. Stumbling up the stairs to my trailer I stopped and said, ""Put your clothes in the washer and leave your shoes outside. I am NOT getting fleas in my house."" He nodded, adhering my commands and followed me to the laundry room as we stripped down to our undergarments. I then took a long, sitting down shower, letting the heat scald my skin clean. I tried to bleach the memories from my brain, but alas, to no avail. ""Is this worth trying to make friends? How can they live like that?"" and other conundrums slipped in and out of my consciousness. As I dried off, exhaustion took its hold on me and I wobbly entered my bedroom.  Climbing into bed with an already snoring Brick, the dark embrace of sleep finally whisked me away from my waking nightmare.

I have never smoked since that day.

Thank you very much for reading and please leave your constructive criticism in the comments.

In the next episode, if wanted, I will regale you with the tale of how Bogica baited a neck beard and a man with questionable decision making into a poly relationship.

We hung out twice, solo on two dates in spring last year (coffee and rock climbing). We fell out of contact over the summer, both got busy with work and are now in the same history class. I like him, and am far more sure of this than I was last year. 

A day ago he asked someone else out, no clue who she is but we talk over phone sometimes (usually about tv shows and video games we like). Texted with him today, he said he had a good date and he’s going out with this girl again next week.

For me the whole situation is unresolved, I’d like to talk to him about and know what he’s thinking or thought before moving on. My interest for him isn’t gone either and I don’t know anything about his relationship with his date, how long they’ve known eachother, etc.

I know sometimes people will see multiple people for a while before deciding if they want to continue with a specific person. I’d be fine with startibg this if we both communicated well and broke it off if he has feelings for the girl he’s seen. I don’t know how casual things are btwn them rn and I don’t know if I should tell him I like him if he’s seeing someone else. I also think it’s possible he thought I was trying to reject when he asked me out for a follow up date June-ish last year (I was genuinely out of town, then sick, then into exam season). Thoughts?

I really have no concrete plans (besides visiting the bean) and am open to suggestions! I was recommended to try Billy Goat Tavern, Athena, Meli Cafe, Xoco, and 90 Miles for food so if there are any accommodations near some of those places that is great, but not necessary. Would like a walkable area with cool coffee shops n restaurants n dive bars. No real guidelines just good vibes pls

If there are any hostel recommendations where people are open to mingling and whatnot that would be great. I would like a lively or social type stay but also open to a quiet and relaxed place. I would like to keep it under ~$110 a night. Hotel, or airbnb is ok too.

I go to therapy, I am medicated for my ADHD, which has translated to me having a steady job that I am excelling at, going to the gym at LEAST 3x a week, eating healthy and cutting out foods that I am intolerant to, watching no pornography, deeply investing my emotions into my relationship after a long time of being reserved, and acting shitty out of fear due to trauma.. no drugs except some Marijuana and Coffee.. 

I am stuck though! I used to be a terrible person. I am currently 23M, and have changed entirely, and I can’t seem to realize that? I used to sell dope, Rob, steal, hurt people, all for money, respect and an idea that I am bigger than I feel. 

I have apologized to the people I love, who have cared about and supported me when I probably didn’t deserve it, I’ve even apologized to some of the people I had deep routed ongoing VIOLENT problems with. I have apologized to everybody, and I can’t seem to accept for myself, that I have indeed changed as a person. 

The thoughts I have, the perspectives I see from these days, the opinions I believe in, and no longer believe in are all aligned with positivity, health, progress and empathy.. but when I think of myself as a person I still believe deep down that I am no good. That I don’t deserve what I have, and that the people who I still have by my side after all the difficult times don’t want to be here, and believe I will not remain in this state of progression and optimism. 

Nobody has personally told me that, but it’s just something I keep telling myself… what do I do?? I want to love myself properly, and I have to consciously bring myself back to the good place I’m in after spiralling through these ideas.

For some background, I did intermittent fasting years ago, with great success. Life kicked my ass a bit and I gained weight back. So here I am again, back at the fasting. I've just restarted, it's been less than a week. I've found this time it's a bit harder rolling life into the routine (I have 3 kids and a partner). 

I know not everything will break a fast. In my research last time they recommended black coffee and stevia as being acceptable during the fasting window. 

As I'm fasting for weight loss (and not gut rest), Im wondering what other things (I have specifics in mind) won't break a fast? 

For example - my partner makes a health drink that has methylene blue, cumin oil, flax oil, and vitamin e in it. None of them contain sugar. Can these items then be consumed during fasting window? ",3,1729871269.0,intermittentfasting,4,1.0,False

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this having some tea and im watching this show called “ oogappels” fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream. I have adhd and because of that I have a new hobby or interest each week . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . Life has been feeling kind of pointless recently and I’m hoping to find someone that makes me abit more excited to be alive everyday ( I know sounds like a big ask ) 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

-Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning )
-a lot of random playlist I’ve made 
-complaints about nonsensical things
-someone that you can annoy at any time of the day 
-someone to have coffee dates with virtually 
-just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 

**disclaimer**

**DONT JUST SEND ME HI /HELLO/HEY/HOW ARE YOU ? If you do this I probably won’t answer so please send me a none boring intro (not just listing your hobbies pretty please )**

For a second, I wonder if I'm going insane. But insane people don't think that they are going insane, right? Everybody knows that. Is it natural to wonder if my existential dread is triggered by reliving a series of stupid mistakes I made when I first stepped into independence and adulthood? Or is it from repeating these same mistakes knowingly and willingly? It makes me wonder if I’m some sort of emotional masochist.

The inability to change myself, combined with anxiety and self-awareness, is a sinister mix and the root of my dread. Sometimes, I wonder if it’s easier to live in denial rather than be self-aware. It’s time to embrace my feelings instead of bottling them up and projecting a tough exterior. Maybe that’s the only way I can break out of this vicious cycle of fear and loathing.

I’m at that phase in life where all my friends have moved on or settled down with family and kids. Being single and pushing 30 is not an ideal place to meet new people or make new friends. I hope to find something real—could be a friend, could be something more. A deeper connection and meaningful conversation. Is that too much to ask for? I really hope not.

I’m on a fitness journey, low-key taking the winter arc seriously, and trying to bring some much-needed discipline into my life. Eating healthy, getting proper sleep, and consistently working out and hitting my goals for the past two months have been keeping me sane. If you’re on a similar journey, let’s keep each other accountable.

I absolutely love banter of all kinds, as long as no feelings are hurt. TV shows, music, and football are my escape from reality. I’m a decent cook and would love to share healthy recipes. I’m weirdly in love with all things black and dark—from my favorite color to how I prefer my coffee, and even the sort of humor I enjoy. If you can relate to me and you’re looking for something similar, let’s connect over DM and take it from there.

I opened it and found they’ve been texting daily for weeks and it goes all the way back to 2021. The same year we got married. This is someone she used to hook up with before me. They often talked about meeting for a “coffee” and joked about keeping it respectful. She sent him feet pics a couple a months ago. There’s several times in the messages they both remind each other to delete the messages but she didn’t realize they were all saved on the iPad.

**$420 - PTS Masada ACR SV DE AEG -** [https://imgur.com/a/6j61CgS](https://imgur.com/a/6j61CgS) \- **Will cover the cost of shipping**

* Various upgrades have been done to it. Purchased back in 2015.
* Spring has been downgraded to M100 spring, and clocked at 346 FPS back when indoor requirements were capped at 360 FPS.
* Wii-Tech steel inner barrel, and Modify Flat Hop bucking are installed
* ~~Wii-Tech Hop up Adjustor Kit and~~ Bearing Spring Guide is not installed but included in the package
* 2x midcap PMAGs included (One full markings and one no markings)
* Clone VSG grip and WML light in DE (battery not included), and MBUS Pro metal sights in BK included
* One pack of Element MOE polymer rails in DE for the above picatinny accessories
* Original A2 birdcage flash hider included, just not pictured
* Simple AR carbine soft gun bag included, original box not included

There are a few issues with this model that's expected for a decade old rifle. They are:

* Missing c-clip/retaining clip for handguard pin (can be purchased from Amazon, Home Depot, Cantire)
* One of the rear metal pins to secure stock to lower receiver is missing (can be purchased from PTS Steel Shop website)
* Bolt release feature is faulty. You must manually pull the bolt a bit to release it from its locked position when adjusting hopup.
* One of the midcap mags have mag feeding issue due to weak spring. You can remedy this by replacing the decade old worn out spring with a new one.

Regarding the metal body pin. I can manually measure using a caliper so you can find a similar one from your local store or home hardware center. Same with the retaining clip. Most or majority of parts can still be purchased directly from PTS at a low cost: [https://pts-steelshop.com/collections/airsoft-replacement-parts-masada-aeg](https://pts-steelshop.com/collections/airsoft-replacement-parts-masada-aeg)

**$420** **- Cyma Platinum MP5 AEG (CM041H) - Asia Model -** [https://imgur.com/a/CO2dBr6](https://imgur.com/a/CO2dBr6) \- **Will cover the cost of shipping**

* Purchased back in 2021, has been used in a few games, wired to Deans
* FPS is capped at 370 FPS, perfect for indoor and outdoor games
* eShooter Kestrel V2 Bluetooth programmable mosfet installed, since the stock mosfet died after a year of use. Kestrel has been tuned by Dave from Airsoft Depot
* 4x additional plastic mags included + 1x original mag that came in the box
* Clone MS2 OD sling and RSA sling adapter included
* One metal M-lok rail adapter included
* The MP5 has a QD latched flash hider with a hidden 14mm CCW threaded barrel beneath it for tracer units or mock suppressors
* Original box and manual included

This rifle has been used in both indoor and outdoor games and has been well taken care of. It's a very snappy and responsive SMG with an impressive 50m effective range with 0.32g BBs. As with all programmable mosfets regardless of whether it's Kestrel, Gate, or Perun, please note it drains batteries fairly quickly. Around 450\~500 rounds in, you will have to plug in a new battery. Tested with HRG 11.1v 1100mAh LiPo.

Additionally, for some reason selector on full auto doesn't seem to register. Either the selector plate is misaligned or the Kestrel isn't intended for an MP5 shell. Regardless, I don't think this is a major issue since majority of fields enforce semi only anyway. You can program the SMG to shoot burst, binary, or full auto on the semi option if needed. I will also include the original packaging for the Kestrel upon selling.

Shooting video will be provided upon request.

My syringes are 100 units = 1ml. My current Rx is 1mg/ml.  Easy.

1gbx1ri,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gbx1ri,Today’s Bug: The Hummingbird Hawk Moth,"Bug of the Day: Hummingbird Hawk-Moth (Macroglossum stellatarum)

Meet the Hummingbird Hawk-Moth, nature’s accidental prankster and wannabe-hummingbird, rocking a wingspan of up to 2 inches—because bigger is better, right? This bug didn’t get the memo on being a “moth” and spends most of its time pretending it’s some kind of tiny, nectar-obsessed bird. But don’t let the floral dining fool you; this moth’s got more moves than a fighter jet at an airshow.

Battle Stats:

	•	Speed: 9/10 – It zips around like it’s late to a party, beating its wings up to 85 times per second. Slow-motion cameras can barely keep up.
	•	Strength: 3/10 – Look, it can’t bench press, but it can hover, okay? Think “less brawn, more flourish.”
	•	Stealth: 1/10 – With its constant “buzz-buzz” sound and neon-orange rear, subtlety is not its strong suit.
	•	Intelligence: 6/10 – These little guys can actually remember which flowers they hit up and when they’re refilled, like that one friend who always knows which gas station has free refills.
	•	Charm: 10/10 – Absolute crowd-pleaser. People actually get excited when they see a moth for once, thinking it’s a mini hummingbird.

Special Abilities:

	•	Hover Flex: Can hold its position mid-air, siphoning nectar like a champ. The hover also distracts onlookers from its actual moth status, which, let’s be real, is the real flex.
	•	Nectar Vision: This moth has color-vision abilities, allowing it to hone in on the good stuff like a caffeine addict with X-ray Starbucks vision.
	•	Zoom-Zoom Mode: Engages turbo, darting from flower to flower, confusing both predators and admirers alike with speed and ferocity. Warning: do not attempt to catch—it can, and will, slip through your fingers.
	•	Amnesia Immunity: With the memory of a steel trap, it actually recalls which flowers it’s drained dry, a level of detail even your brain can’t handle before your second coffee.

Sure, it may look cute, but this winged nectar vacuum could probably outmaneuver half the bugs in your yard in a high-stakes flower dash.",1,1729870349.0,TheSink,0,1.0,False
1gbx1fg,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gbx1fg/nf_a_bouquet_of_red_flags/,[NF] A Bouquet of Red Flags. ,"I’ve always been known to be a great gift giver because the gifts I get people are very unique and personal to the individual receiving it. Often times, they are sentimental gifts that people treasure, but there is also a sprinkle of the unexpected and silly “gifts” that I will get people which are always the most fun. Earlier this year, I was quite surprised when I met my match – someone who was just as good as me at “gifting.” 

We met off Reddit in February – I know, big red flag right? In my defense, I was brand new to Reddit and did not know at the time that the site was crawling with the weirdest people that the planet has ever seen. 

I was single and looking to meet new people and he had posted about wanting to move to my city while also casually throwing his age and the fact that he was single in his post. 

He was the exact same age as me so I figured why not? I slid into his DMs (another red flag I realized later) and we got to chatting. 

Unlike myself, he has been a fellow Redditor for years so he knows the type of people that slide into DMs and would not usually entertain it, but he had just gotten back from a life changing trip which he dubbed “The Bag in the Wind Tour” where he basically traveled solo all around the country and just went wherever the “wind blew.” He was still riding that high of just living in the moment, not overthinking things, and doing things he wouldn’t normally do. 

We met shortly after chatting online. To my surprise, he was the opposite of what you’d expect your stereotypical Redditor to look like. You know - the obese, greasy, smelly dude who hasn’t showered in a week and is pulling lint out his belly button with one hand while eating a slice of pizza with the other. He was not that. He was clean, tall, and very handsome. 

Although I did find him attractive, I admit the connection was not immediate. There weren’t sparks or any of that love at first sight bullshit you hear about in sappy love stories. 

I didn’t think things between us would ever work out because of how different we were. We both also had turbulent pasts that we were still working through. 

While there weren’t sparks, I wouldn’t call it a bad date either. We had some great conversations and laughs while together. 

We continued chatting in the coming weeks and met a couple more times. Each date revealed more of his character and we began to get closer, he was growing on me.  

Although this relationship was blossoming, there were a lot of complexities and red flags on my end. I was in the middle of a divorce and still living with my ex-husband because we owned a house together and had not sold it yet.    

Despite there being so many red flags that were bright as a neon sign telling him to run, my charm was undeniable and one that he simply could not resist. Who knows? Maybe he was attracted to the danger of the red flags. Either way, he was not deterred and we eventually became a couple. 

Unlike other relationships I’ve been in, this one was built on banter. We often made fun of one another – similar to the way young kids would when they had a crush on someone. 

He hadn’t been in a relationship in several years and did not really know how to be romantic or affectionate so he always reverted to his defense mechanism which was to be silly and funny. He often made fun of me for all of my red flags.

One day I was at home, when he told me to check the front door because he had gotten me something and it was just delivered. I could not believe it. He actually got me a gift?!? This was so not like him. 

I squealed with excitement as I ran to the front door. I ripped the package open and out drops a dozen red flags. Yes, **a dozen red flags**. I was astonished and wasn’t sure how to react initially, but found myself laughing seconds later. This asshole really sent me a dozen red flags. I had to admit, that was pretty damn clever. 
 
I did not want to give him the satisfaction so I played into it. While plotting my revenge, I arranged the red flags neatly into a bouquet and placed them on my coffee table for him to see the next time he came over. 

The war was on now.

My dedicated was 6.5 weeks long. There was a lot of prayer, tears, and plain hard work. I wrote this post yesterday but it got deleted by reddit (eyeroll), so I hope I can capture everything I did the first time. My prep was pretty militant and may not be applicable to those applying to less competitive specialties. I hope you can take what works for you and leave the rest.

**General Advice**

* Make a plan and stick to it. You can’t “wing” dedicated. Not having a plan is a surefire way to become overwhelmed. You need to feel grounded during this process.
* Keep your sleep schedule in check. Don’t drink loads of caffeine. No, it doesn’t help you study. It just makes your daily caffeine less effective the more you tolerate it. Try to drink a set amount every day in the morning and leave it at that. If anything, wean down a bit before your exam so the caffeine hits like it should on test day.
* Find something to ease your anxiety. It can be anything. Taking a walk, calling your mom, petting your dog, meditating, lifting, whatever works for you. Make it a point to do that one thing every single day.
* Lean into what keeps you grounded. For me, it’s my faith. I recognize not everyone believes in God. In that case, what is something that gives you peace but defies reason? Is it walking with nature? Do that as often as possible. Find a source of calm to rely on that cannot be shaken by outside sources.
* Try to remove things from your life that encourage a short attention span. Social media is a major culprit of this. You are about to take a 9 hour exam, which means you need your attention span to be LONG.
* Read a book at the end of the day. I will mention this more below, but your reading skills are important for this exam. Read something non-medical (I’m partial to fiction), to wind down and continue building skills. Going on your phone is not *winding down*.
* Have a notebook to write down little factoids that you missed in questions. It’s nice to have a tangible resource of facts that you can review from time to time.

**My Daily Routine**

I studied 7 days a week. I woke up at 6 AM Monday-Saturday and allowed myself to only sleep in on Sundays. This is what every study day looked like:

* Wake up and make some coffee. Sit down at my desk and do some Amboss question sets to warm up (I’ve listed those sets below). I did them all on tutor mode and focused on learning.
* I then picked 2 CMS forms I would do for the day. I had the PDFs, so I went through one and answered the questions at my pace. Afterwards, I would go back and grade my form while learning from it. This would take anywhere from 3-5 hours depending on how I did.
* Listen to 2-3 Divine podcast episodes while walking/working out/cooking dinner. Do some more of my Amboss question sets until around 8 PM. Wind down and read a fiction book until bedtime.

**\*\*\*What Contributed to my Jump: CMS Forms>>>UWorld**

UWorld is an excellent learning resource. I recommend finishing it entirely during your clerkships. It’s a grind but it’s worth it. The only reason you should be logging into UWorld during dedicated is to redo the social sciences and biostatistics questions. That’s it. Content knowledge can only take you so far on this exam, you need to understand how the NBME organizes that knowledge. CMS forms are gold. They contributed to my score jump and my familiarity with question writing. I would do two a day (ex. IM and OBGYN). I never did an IM and Surg form on the same day because those are the most high-yield and deserved extra time/attention. I list below exactly which forms I did but overall, I recommend doing all IM and Surgery, and then doing the other specialties based on your strengths/weaknesses.

Amboss question writing is more akin to NBME than Uworld. I recommend buying a short term plan and using that as a supplemental aid during dedicated. Their question sets are great and their articles are EXCELLENT. I listed below the ones that I used.

**Practice Exam Tips**

* Wake up at the time you would for the real exam. There’s really no reason you should be starting a practice exam at 11 AM or noon. You should be seated and ready to go at 8 AM or a few minutes before.
* Don’t cram study the morning of your practice exams or real exam. I think it actually puts you at a disadvantage. You need a clear mind when you enter exams. If you “prime” yourself with random facts, you may miss obvious questions because you entered the exam having reviewed certain topics immediately before.
* Create identical test situations. Give yourself a sheet and marker for scratch paper. If you have a mouse, use that. Turn off your phone and put it in your closet.
* If you’re anxious before, be happy about that! You’re taking it seriously. Think to yourself, “it’s good that I’m anxious, because I’ll be nervous before the real exam too. This is an accurate simulation of the real exam. It’s good that I will have practice with the anxiety.”
* Your breaks need to be timed. Don’t sit around giving yourself 20 minute breaks on practice exams, you won’t have that on the real one. Eat a snack and look out your window for 5-7 minutes and then jump back in.
* Stay present. Don’t think about the last block or last question. Don’t think about what you might score. Remember, on the real exam, you won’t know your score until weeks after. Don’t get distracted on the fourth block thinking “I wonder what I got!” Stay present until the timer ends and you will deal with the aftermath later.
* Skip questions as needed. Do ethics/biostats/long stem questions absolutely drain your time? Skip them and come back to them. You’ll have more time on the back end which I believe will help with timing anxiety. You don’t want to get caught up on question 28’s stupid drug ad and miss valuable medicine questions that you spent years preparing for.
* Read, read, read. If you’re not a big reader, start now. Get into books, whether fiction or nonfiction. Fast readers have a definite advantage on this exam. IMO, it’s why many IMGs come on here saying that their scores dropped from practice. You need to have a pretty strong reading comprehension level + speed at baseline to master this exam. The good thing is, you can set your baseline! Read!

I took Divine’s Test Taking Strategies Course a few weeks out from my exam. I have a lot of respect for Divine and would recommend this to anyone who can swing the money. You only take STEP 2 once, and you might as well make it count. Personally, I didn’t feel like I gained anything specific from that course, only because I came to the same strategies as I reviewed my practice exams. However, common sense isn’t common. I’m sure what came to me may not come to everyone, so I would ultimately recommend his course if you have the funds to ensure you’ve checked all your boxes.

**How to Review Your Practice Exams**

You should be taking a full day, if not more, to review practice exams. I honestly don’t know how people take and review an exam in a full day, and I don’t recommend it. You need to go back through every single question and put yourself back into the mindset you had when you were testing. This should take a while. Then, ask yourself what reasoning errors you made. Why did I miss this diagnosis? Why did I get distracted? Why did I pick the wrong answer once I narrowed it down to two choices? Resist the urge to say “I just didn’t know it.” Even if you didn’t know the obscure fact, how could you have deduced the right answer? People walk out of this exam and write panic posts that they didn’t know anything. That’s not the right way to think about it. You don’t have to know everything, but you need to be able to reason through anything. Putting this into practice with your exam reviews will make the difference. Step 1 was about content, Step 2 is about interpretation.

I would say 10% of my missed questions on NBME were pure content gaps. The rest were reasoning errors and getting to the root of them is what boosted my confidence.

There’s an excellent reddit post on here that taught me this strategy: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Step2/comments/1b3bwfr/how\_i\_went\_from\_23x\_to\_26x\_in\_a\_week\_and\_a\_half/?share\_id=lvqGxFJSRuNbFPUE0eyxR&utm\_content=2&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=ioscss&utm\_source=share&utm\_term=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Step2/comments/1b3bwfr/how_i_went_from_23x_to_26x_in_a_week_and_a_half/?share_id=lvqGxFJSRuNbFPUE0eyxR&utm_content=2&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1)

**Divine Episodes**

I owe a lot to Divine. The way he thinks about medicine is second to none. I wish I had listened to him more during my clerkship year.

* Most High-Yield Per Reddit: 37, 123, 143, 197, 228, 230, 234, 268, 275, 276, 277, 325, 41, 111, 112, 164, 255, 100, 262, 263, 97, 184, 204, 231

**Days Before**

I did a lot, admittedly, but I finished all of it about 3-4 days out from the exam. At this point, I was pretty burnt out, so I took it very easy. I went to the gym to release anxiety, prayed, drank less caffeine, and kept my sleep schedule consistent. I visited the test center about 2 days out and listened to worship music on my drive. I experienced a lot of anxiety the day before and did my best to distract myself with activities and when I couldn’t, I prayed. I was very emotional the day before because I realized how far I had come and how many exams I had taken to get to this point. I slept probably 3 hours the night before.

**Day Of**

I was anxious the morning of. However, it melted away once I sat down at that computer. Practice exams are instrumental to staying calm: I was nervous before every practice exam and it turned out fine. It’s just another exam. I spent 5 minutes of my tutorial breathing and writing down a murmur chart (that I didn’t use). Then I launched into Block 1. I took a 1 minute break at my desk between Block 1 and 2. After that, I took 5-7 minute breaks where I went to the bathroom, ate a small snack, and sipped some water. Fatigue really hit around Block 4, so I drank some extra water. That did the trick because I was probably dehydrated af. Finished out the exam and left the test center feeling… okay? I didn’t think I failed but I had no concept of how I did. This feeling turned into anxiety during the waiting period for score release.

**Final Thoughts**

I owe my success to God, my partner, Divine, and this reddit. God is the reason I made it this far. If you are struggling with your score, please remember that everything will be okay in the end. I was prepared to change my specialty based on this one score. This exam is daunting, yes, but I got through it because of God’s plan, not mine. My heart is with those of you that are not happy with your scores. I really believe we all will end up where we were meant to. Good luck to all of you.",8,1729870180.0,Step2,1,1.0,False

I stopped because it didnt help me at all.

It has been 5 months since I stopped abilify and no psychoactive substance I tried works at all. Please dont lecture me about the harms of substances etc. I'm just looking for others who experienced this and possibly recovered.

I have tried cannabis, coffee, alcohol, kratom, psilocybin mushrooms and none of them give me any effects, like absolutely 0. No mental or physical change upon taking them. All alcohol did was give me a bit of nausea and thats all.

What is wrong with my receptors? Does anyone have a clue why this could be happening even this long after stopping the abilify? Did anyone suffer from this and recovered?

•••••

Hi everyone, I know not many saw my first post, only like 5 people responded but I wanted to say thank you to them for comforting me & assuring me that I’m truly not in the wrong. I am making this update for myself first, to document my feelings and thoughts & then for anyone who’d like to know the full story now that it’s over.

The last thing I mentioned in part 1 was that my friend (Nancy) confronted me about how I’d changed towards her, and because we’d been friends for so long, I decided to be honest but she got mad. Now, I think it’s the time to bring up how that confrontation came to be in the first place because it’s kinda crazy.. one Sunday Nancy texted me, not asking if she could hang out with me and my friends after church, but just letting me know that SHE IS COMING (that’s what I meant when I said that she’d push herself into our gatherings). Anyways, I was like “okay, I’ll tell you what we decide to do after church is over”, because genuinely we never go to church planning what we’d do afterwards, the idea of going to a certain place or doing a certain activity after, just comes up as we hang out in the church grounds & we go and do that on the spot! 


We hung out and talked for a while that day before deciding to go to a coffee shop to have a snack, on the way there, Nancy called and I know that’s the part where I might have been the AH but I ignored her (because I was already fed up with her dynamic by that point), but she didn’t give up, all of a sudden she started spamming the phones of all my other friends who were with me so she could reach us, eventually I sent her a text telling her that we were at that certain place & that she’s welcome to come. She saw the text then called, angry, blaming me for not telling her immediately where we were going. I apologized and told her that we truly had just decided on where to go & I told her while we were on the way, she still got upset but said she’s coming anyways. That day, she didn’t show up, which was odd but since she’d been getting upset at anything and everything lately, simply acting like a baby, I thought that she had another one of her meltdowns, so I didn’t bother asking why she didn’t come. 

The confrontation started the next day when she texted blaming me for why I didn’t ask about her whereabouts, “I said I was coming, something terrible could have happened to me, why didn’t you ask me why I didn’t come?” - she sent something like that. She then added that she knows that I’ve changed towards her & that she knows that I know so there’s no reason for hiding it, that’s when I told her about my concerns in part 1. I told her that I felt that she’s depending on me for everything, for grounding her while she’s anxious, for holding her by the hand like a baby through every spiritual step, for getting her new friends, for keeping her up to date with everything & for including her in everything I do and everything that I’ve built. There was a lot of back and forth, but a summary of her replies was that she didn’t need me to teach her how to make friends and that she can do this on her own, she told me that I was very defensive about my friends because I was insecure (she simply shamed me for how I went to therapy to get them, how lovely..), she said that she didn’t come to me to speak about my friends in the first place but I made it about me and about my insecurities. At the end of one of the back and forths (because it took a few days of arguing), I told her that I needed time to think and reevaluate everything after she said that I’m jumping into conclusions & making assumptions about her intentions and that I’m letting how my friends feel about her influence me. 

During that week where I left her without texting, I asked a lot of my friends about whether I was in the right or wrong, I asked if I was the AH for setting boundaries to protect myself and my peace.. and everyone assured me that I was doing what was best & that she was outraged because I was available 24/7 then all of a sudden I distanced myself - also those who read the messages could 100% see that I didn’t want to hurt her or lose her, and they could sense how in every single message I considered her feelings and made sure to clarify everything so she doesn’t read in between the lines, but she still did and was insisting to make me out to be in the wrong. Anyways, after a week of reflection and after I took the opinion of 2 other friends who are psychologists too (both graduated and one working as a therapist), we formulated this message which I sent to her :

“Hey, sorry it took me long to get back to you, I was just thinking about everything as I told you. 

So, first I want to apologize if any of what I said or did was hurtful in any way, that was never my intention. 

Second, I realized that part of the misunderstanding we are having is because of my realization to put some boundaries that were needed to protect myself and my wellbeing, so therefore I can give more to you and to everyone else in my life. I know you don’t like foreshadowing words, so I’ll say it bluntly.. I know we talked a million times about how I was affected when you were struggling, but I don’t think you ever realized how intense it was for me & I never told you so you don’t feel like it’s your fault, because it’s not. But, it got to a point where there were nights I couldn’t sleep, I would wake up dead worried about you in the middle of the night, I would panic myself, cry and melt down.. it was intense for me only because I loved you and cared about you. It’s neither your fault nor mine, but I ended up harming myself and my wellbeing in the way, that is why when you became a little better, I decided to put a few boundaries, not to keep you away but actually so I can protect our friendship. Boundaries are put because I want you in my life, not the opposite. 

These boundaries that I tried and am still trying to instill were needed because I felt responsible for trying to get you out of this dark place and eventually it got me & this is why when I saw you getting better, I took a step back, for me to recharge and for you because I felt like you no longer needed that super close type of support. And so you understand why I was talking about friends, I realized that I didn’t only feel responsible for helping with your struggle with panic attacks anymore, it was with religious aspects & friends too. 

Again, I just want to make it clear that I am sending this message to apologize, explain myself better & invite us to have a more open, in person conversation, on how we can stay best friends but while protecting both our mental wellbeings.

Finally, I just want you to know that I would have never sent this message if I didn’t care & if I didn’t love you deeply💓”

She left me on read.

And a few days later I coincidentally went to the church she attended, I saw her from afar but she acted like I don’t exist and left. 

I am 100% sure that she interpreted this message as me kicking her out of my life and telling her that I want her to get away from me, while as you can see it was totally not that, but as I said throughout the whole argument that’s been my tone and she’s just been reading in between the lines and trying to get out a bad intention out of everything I said.

I am at peace now because I feel like I did my best to make it work & it’s her choice to misunderstand things now. But idk, part of me still feels guilty and I have been reflecting on how to handle something like that again if any of my close friends were to face a problem, mental health issues, health concerns..etc. I will of course be there for them, but how much is too much? I feel bad that especially in the mental health aspect, I have a lot of knowledge and techniques but because of boundaries I would be keeping them to myself! 

What do you think overall (after reading part 1 & 2 please, so you get the full picture).. part of me doesn’t know if I’m doing the right thing, even though everyone I’ve asked has told me that I have :/. ",1,1729869936.0,AITAH,1,0.67,False

Turns out after nany failed doctor's visits, it wasnt an STI, STD nor UTI. It has been Vulvar allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).

I first started noticing reaction years ago to clothing friction and during my cycle when I used pads. After this I went through a whirlwind of no meds working, took so many antibiotics and still had issues, then I decided to go comando to see if that made any difference and VOILA! Been wearing a dress with no underwear for days and I have never felt better. I then made the mistake of washing with vaginal wash after uaing the potty and realized my pain woukd come back mildy but on both my privates and turns out I realized I was having inflamatory reactions to the wash. This includes underwear washed with laundry detergent. So I will slowly introduce white only underwear and hydrate and take my pre and probiotics and keep myself from using soaps down there.

Next I will try to wash with soapberries and see if Im safe. 

I also dont use pads. Only cups and cotton hankershiefs and anything that ciuld dehydrate me like coffee etc i need to rehydrate.

Today I walked into my local Starbucks, and a drug rep had literally ordered 33 drinks that she was collecting in plastic tubs and tracking against a spreadsheet on her phone to label everything appropriately. 

Listen here, Barbie Karen, let me break down the math for you. Roughly each drink that you order will carry a maximum time preparation limit of one minute. Hence, should you order 33 drinks, it will delay all orders behind you by 33 minutes. This is unacceptable. Your lack of self-awareness, or perhaps your faint ignorance, is causing the rest of society to be 30 minutes late to everything from that moment forward.

Find a new way to kiss ass! Find a way not to be the community Karen who throws off many people’s schedule for the rest of the day. Find a way to look up from your phone and observe a glimpse at the growing crowd around you, and have the decency and civility to say “I’m sorry” and acknowledge what you’ve done. Thank your baristas for working their asses off to give you this order, and enduring the ugly looks and impatient comments by patrons who’ve had to wait half an hour for a coffee, which is not the barista’s fault.

Drug reps get a new original game. Because by the time you get that mocha frappe latte to the beloved doctor you hope will purchase overpriced insulin that your proud-monopoly based company is pedaling, it’s gonna be lukewarm for all the time it took, and you will get it much less appreciation than it’s worth juxtaposed with the inconvenience you provided to the public at large.

We hit it off very quickly. He lived in a different state so we had a lot of phone conversations about who he was and what he would be for me if we were together and told me that he was going to marry me. I told him what I was hoping for in a partner, what I did want and what I didn't. He ticked off every single box, like my dream of being together was going to be a dream come true. 
His first visit I found out that he was lying to me about smoking. I made it clear that I don't want to be with a smoker and had specifically ask him if he did. He said he was going to quit and I forgave him. 
We continue our relationship and although there are times that he is understanding, he is very harsh on me for what I am going through with my divorce. He takes offense to when I am upset by what I am dealing with or what the kids have to go through. 
He moved down here, and I soon caught him sneaking a vape, which led to me finding out that he smokes marijuana, which again he told me he didn't do. He made mention of cookies and gummies and I agreed to tinctures, gummies, or any medicinal use that was not smoking. The only boundary that I set with him was that I don't want to be with a smoker. We have gotten into a lot of crazy fights because he has an aversion to validating my feelings, he thinks they are almost always wrong. One day he started a preemptive fight over me not letting him hang out with friends which I have never made a single comment or gesture about in a negative way and I was very confused.  It wasn't long before I found out why he was picking a fight with me over something that wasn't a thing and it was because his new friend is actually someone he met at work that would get him cannabis vapes. And I find this out by smelling it on him right after he did it at my house during hurricane prep with the risk of one of my 5 kids seeing him. I was so angry, but I chose not only to forgive him. But told him that if it is only temporary until he can get his medical card and do the tincture or gummies then he can continue until then. He's always broke even though he has a full time job, I provide all of his meals and coffee, and his bills are pretty minimal. 
Yesterday, he told me that he was feeling sad. He told me that it was because of his job. So I tried to encourage him with compliments. I decided to try to surprise him for lunch (which he has appreciated in the past) and he was NOT happy about it. Throughout our argument over it he told me that it was selfish of me to show up, I didn't have his permission, and that I had no right. I am convinced his change of heart is b/c now he spends his lunch smoking his cannabis vape and that was more important to him. He continues to tell me how I don't care about him, how selfish I am, etc. He has a lot of great qualities, but he is so dishonest about his habits and finances.",1,1729869038.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False
1gbwizl,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1gbwizl/does_this_sound_like_gallbladder_issues_saw_a/,Does this sound like gallbladder issues? Saw a doctor and I have an ultrasound appointment next week.,"Hi everyone, I know this page isn’t for medical advice but I’m curious to know if anyone’s experience is like mine.

I’ve been noticing over the past several years that I have steadily become more and more intolerant to fatty foods. IBS symptoms worsened to the point that loose/fluffy stools were the norm for me but no serious pain or blood in stool.

Saw a doctor in 2022 for my digestive problems and received a diagnosis for GERD. Advised to take OTC omeprazole.

January of this year, I had sharp pain slightly left of my belly button that worsened with coffee, fatty foods, and refined carbs. Went back to doctor, I was advised that it could be either stomach ulcer or gastritis and to continue taking omeprazole and 30 days sucralafate, and can continue taking sucralafate as needed.

Diet changes and medication seemed to help over the last several months, but pain always eventually returns when I stop taking medication and try to reincorporate my favorite foods.

Pain doesn’t feel any worse but has moved to my left side and does worsen with moderate physical activity and when I lean forward.

Doctor now thinks is could be a gallbladder issue because he pressed really hard on both sides of my abdomen, and my right side is tender even though pain is felt on the left.

I have an abdominal ultrasound scheduled for next week, but I was curious to know if anyone else’s experience was like this? Everyone else I’ve known with gallbladder problems had a severe attack and urgently needed surgery but my pain has never been severe. It’s just an ache that comes and goes and my anxious brain is concerned that it could be cancer. ",1,1729868991.0,gallbladders,1,1.0,False
1gbwi01,https://www.reddit.com/r/midcenturymodern/comments/1gbwi01/mid_century_florence_knoll_prototype_coffee_table/,MID CENTURY FLORENCE KNOLL PROTOTYPE COFFEE TABLE?,"I acquired this Mid Century steel frame and floating rosewood top coffee table, among other things, at the Joe Oros Estate sale in Santa Barbara in 2012 and was told it is Florence Knoll.

Joe Oros was the Chief of Design at Ford Motor Company from 1955-75 and is being credited for designing the 1964-1/2 Ford Mustang. His house was entirely furnished by well known Mid Century designers.

Although it is not signed and labeled Knoll, there are hand engraved markings on the bottom of the steel tubing which I believe makes this possibly an important piece, perhaps a prototype or first of its kind. The engraving appears to be a Patent Application from 1969. 

Similar coffee tables that I could find online have the wooden top directly mounted onto the steel frame. Some others have top separated by two steel cubes on each side of the table. This one has only one cube towards the end of each side of the table. I haven’t been to find an exact match.

The Devils, currently sitting at a respectable 5-4-1, are looking to shake off a three-game losing streak faster than a Zamboni on a caffeine high. Meanwhile, the Islanders, with a 2-2-2 record, are hoping to find their groove and avoid being the NHL's equivalent of a lukewarm cup of coffee.

The Devils have been favored at -150, which means the bookies are giving them the nod, but let's not forget that underdogs in hockey have a knack for pulling off surprises about 41% of the time. The Islanders, with odds at +125, are like that scrappy team in a sports movie montage, just waiting for their moment to shine.

Now, let's talk about some key players. Nico Hischier is leading the Devils with seven goals and three assists, while Simon Nemec has been making waves over the last 10 games. On the Islanders' side, Noah Dobson has been the assist king with four, and Maxim Tsyplakov is on a roll, which might just be the spark they need.

Injuries? Oh, we've got those too. The Islanders will be missing Anthony Duclair due to a leg injury, while the Devils are without Santeri Hatakka and Topias Vilen. But hey, hockey players are tough, right? They'll just slap some ice on it and call it a day.

So, what's the best bet here? Given the Devils' recent struggles and the Islanders' underdog potential, I'm leaning towards taking the Islanders at +125. It's a risky move, but remember, fortune favors the bold—or in this case, the slightly desperate hockey fan looking for a thrill.

And for those of you who love a good over/under, the total is set at 6. With both teams having a penchant for letting in goals like they're hosting a charity event, the over might just be the way to go. So grab your popcorn, settle in, and let's see if the Devils can exorcise their losing streak or if the Islanders will sail away with the win.",1,1729868624.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

The Jet's grind size dial ranges from 1-45 (higher is a coarser grind/faster extraction), though it is continuous so you can sit 'between' numbers too. I've tried beans from three different roasters so far, and two of them would only pull a decent shot with the grind size set to 40+. The most recent beans we tried wouldn't work with the machine at all. Grind size maxed out at 45 and pulling a single shot took 55 seconds (and obviously tasted like garbage).

The beans we've used were:  
\* Ritual's seasonal espresso blend (medium bodied). About 3 weeks old.

\* Red Whale's espresso (somewhat dark). A week old.

\* This morning's total fail was Kuma Coffee's Classic blend. 4 days old.

As you know, the Oracle Jet auto-tamps, so inconsistent tamping on my part isn't the problem.

The morning sun filtered through the dense clouds, casting an eerie glow over Havenbrook. **Baddy** and **Tatum Paxley** sat on a bench outside the diner, sipping their coffee. Their recent encounter had left them with a mutual respect, but there was still tension, a friction neither could quite shake.

**Baddy**: ""You think someone set that bakery fire?""

Tatum stared at her coffee, her thoughts flickering back to the event that had rocked her life.

**Tatum**: ""I don't know. But everything about it feels off. I’ve been trying to piece things together, but every lead turns cold. Whoever did it knew how to cover their tracks.""

Baddy leaned back, taking a long sip from her cup before eyeing Tatum.

**Baddy**: ""Maybe you're looking at this the wrong way. Sometimes, the person who starts the fire isn't hiding. Sometimes they're right in front of you, playing the victim.""

Tatum's eyes narrowed, her mind racing through possibilities.

**Tatum**: ""You think it could be someone close to Thea? That’s insane. She’s been through enough.""

**Baddy**: ""In my experience, betrayal often comes from where you least expect it. Think about it.""

Tatum's mind buzzed. Could someone in Thea’s circle have sabotaged her? The very thought chilled her, but she couldn't dismiss it. Not after everything she had seen in Havenbrook.

# Andreja and Alinity: The Past Unfolds

Inside Alinity’s home, the conversation between her and **Andreja** grew more intense by the minute. The tension between them had been simmering for too long, and now it was on the verge of boiling over.

**Andreja**: ""I didn't want you dragged into this life, Alinity. But you were always too stubborn to stay away.""

Alinity’s voice was thick with emotion.

**Alinity**: ""You made that decision for me. You lied to protect me, but all it did was tear us apart.""

**Andreja** ran a hand through her hair, pacing the room.

**Andreja**: ""It wasn’t just me, Alinity. There are forces at play here—people who make it their business to hunt down anyone who stands in their way. And now, because of me, you’re on Lady Hunter's list.""

**Alinity** froze, her breath catching in her throat. She had heard the rumors about Lady Hunter, a ruthless bounty hunter with a flawless track record, feared by anyone who crossed her path.

**Alinity**: ""Why? Why would she come after me?""

Andreja stopped pacing and turned to her, eyes heavy with regret.

**Andreja**: ""Because I failed my mission. Lady Hunter doesn't forgive failures. You were involved... whether you knew it or not. Now, she’s coming for both of us.""

There was a long silence, broken only by the distant sound of rain beginning to patter against the windows.

**Alinity**: ""And what was this mission?""

**Andreja**: ""I was supposed to deliver information on... Hendra. A space-faring organization, with deep connections in multiple galaxies. You were my contact, unknowingly, and when I failed, I left a trail.""

**Alinity** shook her head, anger mixing with the fear.

**Alinity**: ""You used me. You were always using me.""

Andreja reached out, desperate to explain.

**Andreja**: ""It wasn’t like that! I tried to protect you once I realized how deep this went. But now it’s too late. Lady Hunter doesn’t miss. And now…""

**Alinity**: ""Now I’m her target.""

The weight of Andreja’s confession hung between them. Alinity’s chest felt tight, like she couldn’t breathe, but the clarity of the situation made one thing obvious—Andreja’s world was far more dangerous than she had ever known.

At the **gym**, **CG Maria** watched as **Gal Gadot** and **Rhea Ripley** sparred, their intense chemistry palpable. They moved with precision, each punch and kick a testament to their skill, but underneath the sweat and adrenaline, something much deeper simmered.

**CG Maria**: ""You two are either going to kill each other or finally admit what’s going on between you.""

Rhea shot Maria a look, wiping the sweat from her brow.

**Rhea**: ""What are you talking about?""

**CG Maria** smirked, crossing her arms.

**CG Maria**: ""Please. I’ve seen this before. This whole ‘sparring thing’ you’ve got going on—it’s not just about training. It’s about working through something.""

**Gal** looked between them, her breathing heavy, but her eyes steady.

**Gal**: ""Maria’s right. This tension? It’s not just about the fight.""

**Rhea**: ""So what are we supposed to do? Talk it out like a couple of schoolgirls?""

**Gal** stepped forward, her voice soft but firm.

**Gal**: ""No, Rhea. We stop pretending.""

There was a beat of silence before **Rhea** grabbed Gal by the front of her shirt and pulled her in for a fierce kiss, the heat of the moment overtaking them both. Maria watched, shaking her head but smiling.

**CG Maria**: ""Finally.""

# Thea, Ivy, and C.C.: Emotional Unraveling

**Thea Hail** stood in her freshly cleared bakery space, now just a shell of what it once was. **C.C.**, one of the **Gangsta Girls**, had been there for her, supporting her financially and emotionally.

**Thea**: ""I don’t know how to thank you for this. You’ve done so much, and I can’t even begin to—""

**C.C.** held up her hand, cutting Thea off.

**C.C.**: ""You don’t have to thank me. I’m not doing this for gratitude. I’m doing this because I know what it’s like to lose everything.""

Thea looked at her, surprised by the depth of her words.

**C.C.**: ""I’ve been where you are. More times than I care to admit. But every time, I rebuilt. Stronger than before. You’ll do the same.""

Just then, **Ivy Nile** walked in, her posture rigid, her expression serious. The tension between her and Thea had grown since her emotional confession, and now it seemed like it was time for them to address it.

**Ivy**: ""Can we talk? Alone?""

C.C. gave Thea’s arm a supportive squeeze before leaving the two women alone.

**Thea**: ""Ivy, I—""

**Ivy**: ""No. Let me go first. I’ve been thinking a lot about what I said. About… how I feel about you.""

Thea swallowed hard, her heart pounding.

**Ivy**: ""I don’t want to make things awkward between us. But I can’t pretend like those feelings aren’t there. I need to know if this is something we can move past… or if it’s something you feel too.""

Thea’s breath hitched as she struggled to find the words. Ivy’s vulnerability, her raw honesty, cut through Thea’s own confusion. But before she could respond, Ivy’s eyes darkened, a flicker of doubt crossing her face.

**Ivy**: ""Or maybe I already know the answer.""

**Thea**: ""Ivy…""

# Yuri and Jennifer: Secret Plans

As night fell over the town, **Yuri Tiger Matsuda** and **Jennifer Wolf** sat together at a secluded diner booth. Their conversation was low, secretive.

**Jennifer**: ""Lady Hunter’s on her way. We don’t have much time.""

**Yuri**: ""I’ve told Andreja, but I’m not sure she understands the gravity of the situation. Lady Hunter doesn’t just come for anyone. This is personal for her.""

**Jennifer** raised an eyebrow.

**Jennifer**: ""You think it’s about Andreja?""

Yuri shook her head, leaning forward.

**Yuri**: ""No. It’s about Alinity. Lady Hunter sees her as collateral damage—an extension of Andreja’s failure. But there’s more to it. There’s history between them, something Alinity doesn’t even know about yet.""

Jennifer leaned back, her fingers tapping rhythmically on the table.

**Jennifer**: ""Then we need to be ready. I’m not letting anyone get caught in the crossfire.""

Yuri’s gaze hardened.

**Yuri**: ""Lady Hunter is powerful, but she’s not invincible. If we play this smart, we might just survive.""

# Cinna and Jenna: Officially Together

At **Cinna’s** place, **Jenna Ortega** sat nervously on the couch, fidgeting with her hands. Cinna watched her from across the room, trying to read the tension in her body.

**Jenna**: ""I think… we need to make this official.""

Cinna smiled softly, sitting next to her.

**Cinna**: ""I thought we already were.""

**Jenna** laughed, a bit of her nervous energy dissipating.

**Jenna**: ""You know what I mean. No more running around in circles, no more mixed signals. Just us.""

Cinna reached out and took her hand, her voice gentle but firm.

**Cinna**: ""Then it’s official.""

They sealed it with a kiss, their future together no longer a question but a certainty.

# The Looming Threat: Lady Hunter’s Approach

Across town, **Lady Hunter** stood at the edge of the cliff where Jennifer had spotted the car earlier. She had arrived in Havenbrook under the cover of night, her presence unseen but deeply felt by those who knew what was coming.

She gazed down at the town below, her lips curling into a cold smile.

**Lady Hunter**: ""They always run. But not this time.""

She turned and walked back to her vehicle, her steps measured and deliberate. Lady Hunter was not one to be trifled with. Her sights were set, and her targets—**Andreja** and **Alinity**—had nowhere left to hide.

The storm was coming, and Havenbrook would soon feel its wrath.",1,1729868097.0,u_SilverEnd1208,0,1.0,False

It's a battle of two teams trying to remember what winning feels like, as both are riding the struggle bus with three-game losing streaks. USC is favored by a whopping 14 points, which is about as comforting as a lukewarm cup of coffee on a Monday morning.

The Trojans have been a fourth-quarter enigma, leading in every game only to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Meanwhile, Rutgers is trying to adjust to Pacific Time, which is a bit like trying to adjust to a new pair of shoes that are two sizes too small. Coach Schiano's admission that he doesn't trust his decision-making at 2:30 a.m. is refreshingly honest, though perhaps not the pep talk his players were hoping for.

USC's quarterback, Miller Moss, has been decent at home with a 6-2 TD-INT ratio, while Rutgers will rely heavily on their star running back Kyle Monangai, who seems to be the only one on the team who remembers how to find the end zone.

The odds are heavily stacked against Rutgers with a moneyline of 5.6, but remember, underdogs win about 35% of the time in football. So, if you're feeling lucky and have a penchant for rooting for the underdog, a small bet on Rutgers might just pay off. However, the safer bet is USC covering the spread, given their home advantage and Rutgers' travel woes.

Prediction: USC wins, but Rutgers covers the spread. Final score: USC 27, Rutgers 20. Best bet: Rutgers +14.5.",1,1729868028.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

Every time I start a new one, I end up reflecting on my old notebooks, and it got me wondering what everyone else does. So, I thought I’d share some of my pages here and hopefully get some discussion going.

I’ve settled on using A5 notebooks exclusively because I’ve found the size works best for me. You can see my older, larger notebooks too. The Midori brand is by far my favorite - it’s just perfect!

I love how a paper notebook is simply there. It’s not like an iPad, constantly asking for your attention.

I’ve also stopped separating work and personal life in my notebooks. One page, I might be crying my eyes out about feeling lonely, writing in messy chicken scratch, and the next page, I’m jotting down work notes. It’s a mixed bag, but it works for me, haha!

One thing I’ve started is a small calendar for at least a quick daily entry when I don’t have time for a full, detailed write-up. I ended up liking it more than I thought I would!

I also started a flight/travel log, which has been super fun to keep up with.

As you can probably tell, I love stickers and stamps! I keep an eye out for them everywhere. Since I’m not great at making art myself, I just use other’s 😂

I’ve let my kid do some artwork in my notebook too - it really livens things up and is such a fun way to capture moments.

Sometimes I get an “ick” feeling when I look back at what I’ve written. Some entries, sometimes entire journals feel pointless or even embarrassing. Does anyone else feel like this?

# First Impressions

Versace's The Dreamer isn't your typical designer fragrance. It's not trying to help you get laid at the club or impress your boss. It's more like what would happen if a Victorian poet had a love child with a tobacco farmer, and that kid grew up to become a slightly pretentious but lovable art student.

The first time I sprayed this, I wasn't sure if I was wearing cologne or if I'd been transported to an alternate dimension where flowers smoke cigarettes and drink absinthe. It's weird, but in a good way. Kinda like walking into a library where all the books are made of iris petals and the librarian is secretly growing tobacco in the reference section.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Update:

**BEST PRICE on Versace The Dreamer here:**

[https://amzn.to/3UlSeCI](https://amzn.to/3UlSeCI)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Scent Profile

**Top Notes:**

The opening is basically a green slap in the face. It's like juniper and tarragon throwing hands in a botanical fight club.

It's definitely fresh, but not in that just showered with your grandma's soap way. The artemisia adds this absinthe-like quality that makes you feel like you're about to start hallucinating butterflies made of smoke. But it's better than it sounds.

**Middle Notes:**

Once the initial herbal chaos settles, the iris shows up like that friend who always knows how to calm everyone down at a party. It's powdery but not geriatric, floral but not feminine. The lily and flax join in like backup singers in a dream-pop band. This is where The Dreamer starts living up to its name I guess. it's ethereal, almost medicinal, like it can transport you somewhere else.

**Base Notes:**

The tobacco blossom isn't your dad's ashtray. It's more like walking past an expensive tobacco shop while eating vanilla ice cream. The amber adds warmth like a cozy sweater you found in a vintage store that somehow doesn't smell like mothballs. This is the kind of base that makes you smell like you have your life together, even when your bank account says otherwise.

# Seasonal Performance

**Summer:** It works, but it's not trying to compete with your sweat.

**Fall and winter:** Probably the best use for this one.

**Spring:** It vibes with the whole ""rebirth"" thing. Just don't overspray when it's hot unless you want to smell like a poetic sauna.

# Compliment Factor

""You smell like my dream journal."" - Art student at a coffee shop

""Is that incense? But like, expensive incense?"" - Yoga instructor

""You smell interesting... good interesting."" - My therapist, probably lying

""It's giving me mysterious writer vibes."" - Bartender who definitely reads Bukowski

# Longevity & Sillage

I get about 6-8 hours of solid performance. The projection is like my social anxiety: noticeable but not overwhelming. It leaves a nice trail without choking out my coworkers, which is really all you can ask for.

# Bottle Design

The bottle looks like what an 80s movie thought the future would look like. It's got that vaporwave aesthetic before vaporwave was a thing. The cap is unnecessarily large, like it's compensating for something, but the whole package somehow works. It'll stand out on your shelf without looking like it's trying too hard.

# My Experience

I've worn this to job interviews (got the job), first dates (mixed results), and family gatherings (my aunt asked if I was ""going through something""). It's become my go-to scent for writing sessions and late-night existential crises. It's not a crowd-pleaser in the traditional sense, but it pleases the right crowd.

# Who's This For?

* People who write poetry but tell everyone they're ""working on a novel""
* Anyone who owns more than three black turtlenecks
* Individuals who can appreciate art without being pretentious about it
* People who want to smell unique without smelling weird
* Anyone who thinks regular designer fragrances are ""too mainstream""

# Final Thoughts

The Dreamer is like that indie film that you're not sure you understood but know you loved. It's not going to be everyone's signature scent, but that's exactly why it's special. In a world of clone fragrances and safe plays, The Dreamer stands out by being unapologetically abstract.

**Rating: 8.5/10** – Points deducted for making me question reality every time I wear it.

The WORST SCORERS:  Now comes everyone's favorite part of the report - the list of Rotten Restaurants who scored worse than 85.  I don't post any place that scores 85 or above even if they were the worst inspections for a particular week.  85 is a solid B and I don't want to shame them.  

-----------------------


That Guy's Food Service (mob), Bend Score: 83 (10/10)

Sonic Drive-in #6046 (Redmond), Redmond Score: 78 (10/09)



-----------------------
 

I'm going to stick these identifiers here so that when you see stuff like (mob) and (wh) you'll have some idea of what they are talking about.  I'm not positive about all of these but they're probably pretty close.  If you see anything I've missed or I guessed wrong please let me know.

e - fee exempt

mob - mobile

wh - warehouse

rp - recreational park

f - fixed position (a normal restaurant)

com - commissary

tf - traveler's accommodation

L - Limited Service

V - vending machines?

I love the country and the people and I visit often.  I am aware of the laws surrounding being a couple that is not married (my partner is Moroccan), but I am interested to know where the line in this is. Am I allowed to have a male visitor to my apartment just a few hours during the daytime?  
I have social anxiety and constantly going out to coffee shops & restaurants all the time so we can spend time together as a couple is exhausting for me and is also becoming incredibly expensive financially to be eating out every single day.  
Any advice or comments welcome.

TikTok feels more predictable - make content with 40% watch rate and you’ll get views. Instagram? Absolutely no idea. Get told shares are importantly, but my partner gets more shares than influencers in the same niche and country but they’re getting much more views. 

We have had account audits done in the past but they don’t seem to hit? 

Any help is greatly appreciated. Please DM me for her account details. 

I’ve attached her most recent 30 reel stats which should hopefully illustrate how hard she’s been hit the last period. Posted in order from most recent.

Any place to do that in Taipei at night that isn't a bar or something? 

I'm not into parties or alcohol but like shisha and coffee very much. 

It seems everything shuts down around 22:00?

1gbvqyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalsignage/comments/1gbvqyp/advice_for_a_small_coffee_shop_doing_a_big/,Advice for a small coffee shop doing a big renovation- any input appreciated :),"Hey everyone! I have a question that is similar to many asked here before, so I apologize for the redundancy, but I promise it is asked with good reason! A lot of the posts containing the information I am looking for are a few years old, and with many software companies going in and out, I am hoping to get some updated information :)

I am looking for digital signage for my small cafe- something we have put off for a long time because of our love affair with our current wood burned menus. They are just as gorgeous and attractive as they are inconvenient and impractical when you need to change prices, and our store is littered with tiny ""specials"" sheets and other signage- it is time to make the change.

Applicable Info:

\- We are proficient in Adobe Illustrator & Canva

\- We use square as our POS, website, online ordering, etc

\- We are a small shop with a big menu, but will only need between 1 - 3 screens (we currently have 4 Menu boards of various sizes)

\- We will not be implementing these until we renovate in February so we have time to shop around!

\- Also open to any suggestions of things we should shoot for with our renovations to make implementing these go smoothly. We are already renovating, so can do pretty much anything!

Features that we are looking for:

\- Easily customizable and compatible with adobe & canva

\- Remotely customizable when not on site 

\- Able to be used in landscape or portrait mode

\- Stays on no matter what & does not go out when our internet goes out

\- Reliable application with support and a positive track record (aka we don't want to put time and money into equipment if the application will merge or cease to exist in a few months/years. Crazy concept I know, but it has happened to us in the past with POS systems and it sucked)

\- Compatible with Square (aka can pull prices from square) \* However, I am not sure how this translates when you have items with many variables such as hot/iced/different prices, so this may not be realistic. For example, our beverages come in hot/iced and 3 different sizes. Our iced beverages are a standard $.50 more than our hot beverages. We would have this noted at the top of the column of prices, rather than having 6 different listed prices for each drink

\- Low or no monthly cost (upfront cost is okay) Being a seasonal business, we do 80% of our business Memorial Day to Labor Day, and would love something that didn't commit us to paying a monthly fee year round

Thank you! We are also happy to hear recommendations on TVs, we will be purchasing those on Black Friday or Cyber Monday",2,1729866997.0,digitalsignage,1,1.0,False
1gbvp93,https://www.reddit.com/r/MythosIndustries/comments/1gbvp93/illyria_23/,Illyria 23,"I wake up still slightly high the next morning. I make an iced coffee and sit on the patio. As I sit, Aurora walks out.
“You’re here early. “ I say.

“Wanted to get a jump on some things. Any coffee left?”

“Half a pot inside.”

Aurora walks inside and in a few moments she walks out with her own iced coffee and sits down. Before taking a sip, she lights a cigarette.
“You look well rested.”

“I had a nice dream so to speak.”

“Anything you want to share?”

I lean back with my coffee.
“Not right now.”

Aurora takes a drag as she nods.

The door of the guesthouse flies open and Lilith and Fang run out. Followed by Holden. He walks up to us.
“Morning, bitches.”

“Morning, asshole.” I say before taking a sip.

Aurora smiles.
“Morning.”

“What are you up to today?” I ask.

Holden sits down.
“Seems your little park is closed for repairs today. Thought I would take these two little assholes since it will be empty. You two want to come?”

I think about it for a second.
“Why, yes. I would like to go to the park my mom owns.”

Aurora leans back as she exhales a plume of smoke.
“I’m in.”

“Since you two are here. Let me take care of something.” Holden says before whistling. Lilith and Fang run over.
“On either side of me.”
They stand on either side of Holden and he puts an arm over each one’s shoulders.
“Listen you two. Betty and Aurora are kinda part of our pack. As such, your job is to protect them at all costs. Understand?”

Both Lilith and Fang nod. This warms my heart.
“Thanks.”

“Do I get to wear a cut?” Aurora asks.

“You do not.” Holden answers.

“Before I forget. That includes Maddy. Got it?” Holden says.

They both nod.

“Ok. Now run along. We will be leaving soon.” Holden says.

Lilith and Fang give Holden a light head butt before running off.

“Look at you, daddy.” Aurora says.

Holden leans back his head and sighs.
“It’s too early for your bullshit.”

Aurora takes a drag before laughing.

“So. After the park. Then what?” I ask.

“Dropping these two off here and heading to the clubhouse. We got church later this afternoon. Then I don’t know.”

“Speaking of the clubhouse. When are you going to throw a party we can come to?” Aurora asks.

“Patience. It’s almost done.”

I finish my iced coffee.
“Well. Let me get changed and we can go.”

“Hurry your ass up.” Holden tells me.

“Shut up.”

I go inside and throw on some clothes. Complete with one of my old Diesel Farm Truck shirts. Once ready I head back downstairs.
“Let’s roll, asshole.”

Holden and Aurora whistle and Lilith and Fang come running. Scorn lands on Aurora’s shoulder. Holden looks at Fang.
“You ride with them. Make sure they make it safely.”

Fang nods.

“My man.” Holden says before they bro hug.

As we walk to the garage. Aurora looks down at Fang.
“I’ve never had a personal guard before. And a handsome one at that.” She says as she rubs one of Fang’s ears.

I can’t be sure but I think Fang is blushing. We get into Jolene and follow Holden on his bike with Lilith on the back.

“This should be relaxing.” Aurora says.

“Yeah. When the park renovations are done. I think I’ll keep it closed an extra day and bring the gremlins and fairies. It will be nice to see both colonies hang out.”

“That does sound nice.”

As I drive, Scorn and Fang gently play in the backseat. When we pull into the park and park Aurora asks,
“So what’s being done to the park?”

“Amphitheater is being renovated. Some new plants are being added. It will only be closed for two weeks.”

“Cool. I used to love coming here as a kid. This place is so cool.”

As we walk. I mumble to myself.
“But a lot of bad shit has happened here.”

As we walk. Scorn rides on Fang’s shoulder. Seems there’s a new friendship blossoming. We join Holden and Lilith.
“Bout time you got here.” Holden says.

“Shut up. Move over.” I reply.

We sit in the shade as Lilith, Fang and Scorn play. It was some sort of game where Lilith and Fang was trying to catch Scorn. Aurora lights a cigarette.
“So how are things in The Pack?”

“Good. Now our next hurdle is to get some revenue coming in.” Holden answers.

“Any ideas?” Aurora asks.

“Some. That’s what today’s church is going to be about.”

Aurora takes a drag.
“So what are the ideas?”

Holden smiles.
“That’s insider information.”

As they talk I look to another part of the park. There is a line of trees and on the other side is an open field that’s part of the park. I see someone walking across it.
“Huh.” I say.

“Whats up?” Holden asks.

I squint as I lean forward.
“I think that’s Dylan Wilson.”

“Who?” Aurora ask.

“Kid from school. He was way quiet but nice.”

“Yeah kept to himself. Want me ask him to leave?” Holden asks.

“No. His in a whole other part of the park. He’s not bothering anybody. Looks like he is just passing through. He’s fine.” I say.

Holden and Aurora keep talking. As I watch Dylan. He’s just walking, head down. Not bothering anybody. He stops walking and looks around. He looks at his arms and runs them. Then, out of the blue. He is hit by a multicolored sphere of energy streaking down from the sky. Dylan goes flying.
“Holy shit.” I scream as I stand.

“What?” Holden says as he stands.

“Dylan just got hit with something.” I answer.

Dylan stands and takes off running. Way faster than a human could. Even I would not be able to keep up with him. Holden starts to jog towards Dylan.
“Holden stop.” I say.

“Why? He might be hurt.”

“I don’t know. He seems fine. Man, that was weird. Besides at the rate he was running. You would’ve never caught up to him.”

“Are you sure?” Holden asks.

“Yeah. I’ll tell Maddy to keep an eye out on the network. Maybe something like this has happened before.”

“If you’re sure.” Aurora says.

“I am. I’ll just yell Maddy to check the hospitals and the police station later today. Just to make sure nothing has been reported and that he is all right.”

“What was it that hit him? There was no explosion.” Holden says.

“I don’t know. It was like a multi colored ball of energy. Have you heard anything like that?” I ask Aurora.

She shakes her head no.

Holden stands there with his hands on his hips.
“Well. Fuck. Guess we’ll have to wait and see.”

“Nothing else to do. He’s long gone by now anyway.” I say as I sit down.

“Lilith and I will sweep the area before we leave. Just in case.” Holden says. Then he tilts his head.

“What’s up?” I ask.

“Motorcycles and a lot of them.” He answers.

“Maybe it’s just The Pack.”

“I mean…maybe. But nobody knows I’m here.”

Holden whistles. As well as Aurora. Lilith and Fang run to Holden. He whispers something and they take off. Scorn lands on Aurora’s shoulder she whispers something to him and he takes off.
“What the fuck did you two do?” I ask.

“Sent them to hide.” Holden answers.

“Sent Scorn to do some recon and see who that is.” Aurora answers.

“Well. Ok. Good ideas.” I say, I pat my hip where my hatchet is strapped to me and ask Aurora.
“You got your stuff?”

Aurora pats her satchel.
“Yup.”

“I am my weapon.” Holden says as he takes off his cut.

Scorn flies back and lands on Aurora’s arm. Whistling excitedly. I can hear what he is saying.
“Shit. It’s not The Pack.” I say.

Seconds later. The Lobos ride up. As they ride up in the grass and stop I say.
“Didn’t you read the sign? No vehicles on the grass.”

“Sorry little lady. Add my fines to the late fees I owe the library.”

“I doubt you read.” Aurora says.

Tock chuckles.
“I’ve been known to peruse a gentlemen’s magazine here and there.”

Tock then looks at Holden as the rest of the Lobos pull out guns.
“Times up, Holden. Where’s the claw?”

“Why you want to know? You’ll never have it.”

Tock looks around at his members.
“Punk kid been watching too many action movies.”

The Lobos laugh.

Tock turns back to Holden.
“I’m not playing kid. Where’s the claw?”

“I’m not playing either, dipshit.” Holden replies.

“Y’all need to leave. I have powerful friends.” I say.

Tock leans towards me and in a mocking tone he says.
“Oh yes. I’m sure the pumpkin spice crew is fearsome.”

The Lobos laugh.

“Well. You don’t know what you don’t know.” I reply.

“I’ll tell you what I do know. If Holden doesn’t give me the claw right now. All of you are going to die. Right here, right now.”

All of the werewolves heads turn. Seconds later, a shit ton of cars pull up. Lead by a jeep. Once they stop. Mercy gets out of the jeep.

“No nobody reads the signs.” I mumble to myself.

“Who the fuck are you, little lady?” Tock asks Mercy.

“Mercy. Alpha of the Blood Fang.”

“Nice to meet you. You can leave. This isn’t Blood Fang business.” Tock tells her.

“That’s where you’re wrong. The Pack has a treaty with us. They can come and go as they please as long as they check in when they get inside a pack’s territory. You don’t have a treaty. Nobody knows who the fuck you are. Your just some pack that is interloping and trespassing.”

Tock holds up his hands.
“Now. Whoa. Hold up. We are new. We haven’t gotten a chance to form alliances. We certainly don’t want beef with the Blood Fang.”

“And yet, here we are.” Mercy says.

Holden steps forward.
“I didn’t ask for your help, Mercy. Hey Tock. I have an offer.”

“I’m sorry. This isn’t a negotiation. Give us our property or die.” Tock responds.

“Considering you’re outnumbered. You’re not really in a position to call the shots. Fight me for the claw.” Holden tells Tock.

“Boy, you wouldn’t stand a chance against me. Besides your little friend Mercy would jump in. It wouldn’t be a fair fight.”

Holden snorts.
“Mercy is here because you are in her territory. There’s no love lost between us. She won’t interfere.”

“Either Holden kills you or I will. No matter what, you losers will leave here with your tail in between your legs.” Mercy says.

“Nah. This is what I’m talking about. Not fair. We will leave. We will settle this another day.” Tock states.

“No. I’ve challenged you. You leave and I will call every Prez in The Pack. Word will spread. The Lobos will be blacklisted by all of our kind. All because you are weak and sacred.”

“Boy. Be smart about this. You won’t survive me.” Tock responds.

“I’ll tell you what. Leave while I’m changing into alpha form. You still here when I’m done. You all are dead.” Holden says as he starts undressing.

Tock smiles. He also starts undressing. They both get naked and transform at the same time. Then they both roar and charge at each other. I grab Aurora and drag her behind a tree. Holden and Tock swipe at each other. Tock grabs Holden and throws him. Holden quickly pops up and grabs a nearby motorcycle. As Tock rushes him. Holden swings the bike and hits him. Upon impact, many little pieces break off the motorcycle. Hurt but not badly, Tock tries to bite Holden. Holden swings and his claw hits the back of Tock’s skull. Then Holden grabs Tock’s head and slams it onto the ground. Holden roars as he rears back and before he brings his claw down. There is a sound of a thunderous boom. Holden’s chest explodes and blood flies everywhere. All hell breaks loose. The Blood Fang transforms en mass. Some run towards the sound. Others attack the Lobos. I scream as I run.
“Holden!”

Aurora is right behind me. Out of the bushes and in a full run is Lilith and Fang. Tock growls then transforms. He looks down at Holden.
“We will get the claw one way or another.”
He then grabs his cut, hops on his bike and takes off.

Holden is surrounded by me, Aurora, Lilith and Fang.
“Do something.” I yell at Aurora.

Aurora rummages through her satchel. She pulls out a small bottle and pours it on the wound in Holden’s back. Then she starts mumbling something.

“Is it working?” I ask.

“I don’t know. Werewolves are a complete different biology.” She says then looks up. She looks around and says. “Life is energy. Energy can be transferred.”

“What?” I ask.

Aurora puts one hand on the wound and the other on the ground. She starts mumbling as her eyes roll back in her head. The grass under her hand turns black and withers.
“Not enough. Maybe that tree. Help me.” 

I start pulling on one of Holden’s arms. I slowly start dragging him across the ground.

“Hurry.” Aurora says.

“I’m trying.” I scream back.

Mercy and some members of the Blood Fang try to approach but Lilith and Fang starts growling and block them.
“Easy. I know we are not your pack but we want to help.” Mercy says.

Lilith growls louder as Fang backs up towards Holden. I can’t move Holden fast enough. Alpha wolves are incredibly heavy. I’m stronger than most but I’m having extreme trouble.

There is a crack of thunder. So massive it shakes the ground. Something falls from the sky and hits the ground. Sending dirt everywhere. From what mom has told me. I think it’s Artemis. I am right. Artemis stands and walks out of the crater. Mom’s description is accurate. She is wearing like fantasy, bikini armor and she is beautiful.

“Artemis.” Mercy whispers.

All of the werewolves kneel as she approaches. Except for Lilith and Fang.
“Come now. You’re wolves, not dogs.”

“Artemis.” Mercy says as she stands. 

Artemis smiles and cups her chin as she walks past. Artemis takes a knee next to Holden and strokes the back of his head.
“Oh, Holden.”

“I’ve tried everything I could but…” Aurora says but she is cut off by Artemis.

“I know, witch. I’ll take it from here.” 

Artemis keeps stroking the back of Holden’s head.
“Sweet Holden. One of my finest creations. Many paths lay before you. I wonder which one you will take? I’m most pleased by your recent actions.”
Artemis looks at Lilith and Fang.
“Come.”

Unsure but compelled. They slowly walk forward. Artemis puts a hand on each of them.
“So beautiful. I might love your kind the most. Do you know why you exist?”

They shake their heads no.

“As a test. You are to measure how strong a pack is.”

Then Artemis looks at Mercy.
“When you are full grown and not a moment sooner. How that instruction got lost in time. I’ll never know.”

Then Artemis looks back at Lilith and Fang,
“You are the greatest of my wolves. It pleases me that you found an alpha worthy of leading you.
Artemis stops and thinks for a moment.
“In fact. All of you will feel compelled to find Holden. When ready, then you will test your birth pack. You two will be the first. Now receive my blessing.”
Artemis then kisses each one on the head.

“Um. Ms. Artemis. Holden is dying.” I say.

Artemis looks up at me and smiles.
“Do you really think I would let him die in my presence, daughter of Faust? I’m a god. I move precisely when needed.”

“I mean no offense.” I mumble.

“None taken. I see much of your mother in you, I know you are concerned about your friend.”

Artemis puts a hand on Holden’s wound. She then kisses him on the head. When she does this. A golden light shines where her hand is. A low haggard breath escapes Holden.
“There you go.”

Artemis stands and looks at Aurora.
“He will be fine in a few hours. Watch over him until til he wakes.”

“I will.”

“Thank you witch.”

Artemis then goes and holds Mercy’s face.
“I can not wait until you join the great hunt.”
Then Artemis kisses her in the forehead.

Artemis then walks twenty feet and shoots into the sky and disappears. As I look at the sky, I say.
“Well…huh.”

Aurora stands next to Fang and elbows him.
“Got kissed by a smoking hot god. What’s that like? Don’t get a big head over this. You are still my personal guard first.”

I think for the second time today, Fang blushes.

“What of the Lobos?” I ask Mercy.

Mercy snaps out of her stupor.
“On the run, Tock and half of them are still alive. We got the sniper.”

“Will he be tried?” I ask.

“Even if we had a court for this sort of thing. There’s not enough of him to appear.”

“I see.”

Mercy folds her arms as she looks down at Holden.
“Much has changed today. I have some calls to make. Artemis has spoken. Her words need to be heard about the stuck. When he wakes, tell Holden I’ll call him later. We have much to discuss.”

“I will.” I say.

Mercy nods and walks away, within a few moments the Blood Fang get in their cars and drive off. I turn to Aurora.
“I got to go and tell Holden’s chapter what happened. They can grab these Lobo motorcycles and sell them or something.”

“Good idea.” Aurora says as she sis next to Holden. Lilith and Fang sit next to her. She puts an arm around each one’s shoulders. “Since we will be here for a bit. Might as well have a picnic. Can you pick us up something?”

“Sure. I’ll pick up a bucket of chicken on the way back.” 

“With all the fixings.”

“With all the fixings.” I say.

I walk over and put a hand on Holden.
“I’m so glad you’ll be ok. I’ll see you later, buddy.”",6,1729866869.0,MythosIndustries,1,1.0,False
1gbvnfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1gbvnfv/daily_driver_inventory_management/,Daily Driver inventory management?,"TLDR; What do you run with every day? I need a minimalist daily driver for simplicity.



**Current Situation:**

Okay so I've been playing for a bit (since the show) (on PC) and I've picked up Fallout1st because I don't want to spend a ton of time managing inventory.  FO1st has helped a lot, but I'm still struggling to figure out what I want to run with as a daily driver.  So I have three main load-outs, Bloodied Commando, Bloodied Cremator (Heavy Weapons), Melee and then a bunch of load-outs for crafting/repairing/building/gathering.

On my daily driver build (Bloodied Commando) I run all the weight reduction perks (Traveling Pharmacy, Bandolier, a Grocer's Backpack, and I even have weight reduction on most of my secret service armor pieces (2x weapon weight reduction, 2x Thru-Hikers, 1x Pack Rat).  All the armor is Unyielding and I run high rads so my strength is high and my carry weight is usually \~350-400.

S:  Arms Keeper(3), Bandolier(2), Ordnance Express (3), Traveling Pharmacy (3)

I: Batteries Included (3) 

A: Thru-Hiker (3)

**Stash Management:**  
So the question is what are you all keeping in the Stash? I'm still constantly full on stash and I've taken to running mule characters to offload some weapons. I don't want to store any temporary things (Food, Aid) in my stash. I only want to store weapons (I'm a hoarder) and armor. Since I have FO1'st all Ammo is ""free"" weight wise and also Junk, so there is basically zero of that in my stash (10 Power Cores).  I am holding a lot of magazines (\~100) and bobbleheads (\~40) and Serums (\~30) in the stash for crafting of Legendary Mods and I currently have about 25 Legendary Mods as well.  My stash is almost all weapons and armor. 

**Character Carry:**

I run about 300 lbs everywhere. I think this is too much but I just can't bring myself to throw away stuff.  Weapons are only the ones I use Medics Thirst Zapper, Elders Mark, Fixer, Railway, Auto-Axe, Holy Fire and Cremator. Armor is only what I wear, Secret Service set + Chinese Stealth Suit for Nuke Zones. All the Chems my character has in the world are carried on me and I keep way more than I should (And never use them).  All the food is also carried on me (Herbivore) and I drop meat after cooking all the time. I'm probably carrying 200+ different Nuka Colas because I'm a hoarder, I don't even use them except to make Nuka Grenades and Quantum Thirst Zapper ammo.  Ammo management is pretty easy with the Ammo Box and Tent. I never carry junk even though I loot everything in sight because I'm constantly putting it into the Scrapbox.

**What do I actually use everyday?**

Food: Company Tea, Brain Bombs (Carrying about 100 Sugar Bombs), Gourd Soup, \* Soup, Coffee.

Aid: Stimpacks, Rad Away-Diluted (to manage rad levels)

Weapons: Mostly Railway and Cremator although I have been enjoying the Elders Mark and Fixer lately for the stealth.

  
**How much food/chems/weapons are you running around with daily?**

# Chapter Three

  

How many times had I dreamed of this moment? How many nights had I imagined walking down the aisle, the love of my life waiting for me at the altar?

Everything was perfect. Almost everything. Except for the man standing at the end of that aisle, the man I was supposed to marry. The man whose eyes were filled with cold indifference instead of love. My heart ached, and I blinked back the tears threatening to spill, refusing to let them make a scene.

The ceremony was a blur, a haze of vows and traditions I barely registered. My thoughts were consumed with dread as I realized what awaited me — a home where I'd be alone with him, a man who clearly didn’t want me.

During the car ride back, Sorin sat as far away from me as the backseat allowed, his gaze fixed outside the window, his silence as heavy as the tension between us. I wanted to say something, anything to break the ice, but the fear of irritating him kept my lips sealed. I couldn’t help but glance at him, at his strong profile, every feature so painfully familiar from the countless times I'd admired him from afar.

“Quit staring. It's irritating.” His voice was icy, cutting through the silence like a blade. He cast me a brief glance, the look in his eyes sharper than his words.

“Sorry,” I whispered, my cheeks burning as I quickly looked away.

When we arrived at his house — no, his mansion — it felt like stepping into a dream, or rather, a nightmare. The place was as grand as one could imagine, but it held no warmth for me. It wasn’t a home; it was a gilded cage.

I followed him inside in silence, my stomach in knots as he led me to our bedroom. ""Our"" bedroom. I hadn’t expected that. Seeing the surprise on my face, he rolled his eyes and sighed. “My parents locked the other rooms. Apparently, they’re adamant that we sleep in the same one.”

Embarrassment washed over me. His parents clearly had hopes for this union that didn’t align with reality. He gestured towards the couch. “You’ll sleep there.”

I nodded, my throat too tight to speak. As I approached the couch, I noticed a pillow and blanket already laid out, a silent but clear arrangement. I sank into the cushions, trying to make myself comfortable.

""Wait."" His sudden command startled me. I turned, finding him pinching the bridge of his nose, visibly conflicted.

He sighed heavily. “Never mind.”

Confused, I resumed my place on the couch. But before I could relax, he spoke again. “No, wait.” He looked exasperated, as if warring with himself. “You can... share the bed. If you’re comfortable.” 

I hesitated, my eyes drifting to the bed. It was large enough for both of us, but sharing it felt too intimate, too overwhelming. Still, the couch wasn’t exactly inviting either.

“Are you sure?” I finally asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He nodded stiffly. “Yes.”

Taking a deep breath, I got up and slowly made my way to the bed. He laid down on one side, and I settled on the other, making sure to keep as much distance as possible. My back was to him, and I prayed that sleep would come quickly, though I doubted it would.

Just as I was starting to relax, I heard the sound of pillows being moved. I glanced over my shoulder to see him placing a row of pillows between us.

“I hope you don’t kick in your sleep,” he muttered, his tone dry.

Heat rushed to my face. ""I don’t think I do,"" I mumbled, though I wasn’t entirely sure.

The night passed in tense silence, but at some point, I must have drifted off. A sudden groan woke me, and I blinked groggily, trying to figure out what had happened. My heart sank when I realized that, in my sleep, I had somehow managed to kick Sorin in the chest.

“Oh my God, I’m so sorry!” I gasped, covering my mouth in horror.

He glared at me, jaw clenched, clearly in pain. He shoved my leg back over to my side of the bed and got up without a word, heading straight for the bathroom.

“I’m sorry,” I called out again, desperate for some form of forgiveness. “Does it hurt a lot?”

He ignored me, his face a mask of irritation as he disappeared into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. A tear slid down my cheek, but I quickly wiped it away. Crying wouldn’t help. Nothing would.

I decided to make breakfast, hoping maybe it would soften the edges between us. By the time I finished, I heard him coming down the stairs, impeccably dressed in a navy blue suit. He looked just as handsome as ever, but he walked past the kitchen without a glance in my direction.

“Um… breakfast?” I stammered, trying to gather the courage to speak.

He paused for a fraction of a second, then continued walking toward the front door. Without so much as a word, he left, slamming the door behind him.

I stared at the untouched plates in front of me, my heart sinking further. I sat down at the table and forced myself to eat, though every bite tasted like ash. The lump in my throat grew with each passing second as the reality of my situation settled in.

Sorin would never love me. I was nothing more than an inconvenience to him, a burden he’d been forced to bear. My heart longed for something, someone to care about me, but all I had was emptiness.

Tears welled up again, but this time, I didn’t bother to fight them back. No one would see. No one cared.

I just wanted to be loved.

Checked the rules before posting this and it does seem to be within the “questions about visiting category” under rule 5 and should be okay; I’m sorry if it’s not!! But when I do move (currently awaiting migration application), this will be a big thing for me haha. 

I’m a Costco member in the US, but have yet to visit the one in Täby. Do you think it’s worth it and cost-effective to shop there? My fiancé lives in Sweden but has never gone to know if the “deals” are good or not. I’m visiting him in November and I figured I would go one day while he’s working to do some shopping for us. It’s about an hour train ride from his house to Stockholm and 30ish minutes from Stockholm to Täby centrum. Then however long to Costco. I can’t buy a ton of stuff since I will be on the trains and have to carry it all myself hahaha 😅 But the trains/buses seem to be only a few bucks each, so not a huge travel cost if that factors into any decisions. Seems to only cost just a little more than taking a bus and train from his house to neighboring areas for the bigger grocery stores, but not by much.

My main interest is groceries. He shops at a small ICA near his house so it’s a little pricy and not the greatest selection of products compared to ICA Maxi or Stora Coop. It’s the only grocery store in the little area where he is. I would like to get some more things to fill the pantry and be able to actually cook a variety of meals instead of us always eating out. Would I be able to find decent/enough things at the Costco in Sweden, or am I better off cost and selection-wise sticking to closer grocery stores instead? 

I hope this makes sense, I haven’t had my daily coffee so my brain is struggling to form words haha! Thank you in advance for your input! I’ve tried to look on the Costco website but it’s not super helpful :)",2,1729866282.0,TillSverige,8,0.75,False

so now im going to keep doing this especially offering same day deliveries bc i’ve had ppl ask me to ship same day cause they needed it for vacay etc but it didn’t arrive on time & they knew that might not be the case. so if they live in my city & i can make it happen for added cost. so now i offer not only shipping (worldwide) but meet ups (set meet up points), pick ups, drop offs (added cost).

(on the depop address settings the buyer need to put their phone number, i include this in every post for the items I have for sell - this is helpful for intl delivery, meetups, drop offs, uber delivery, pick ups even domestic delivery !!) 

meetup up orders placed before 12pm no shipping cost (2 hour clearance for meetup time to be set), after 12pm i charge extra $8 (same day delivery only) 

drop offs (public place near them- further than my meetup areas) whether it be same day or another day i charge an extra $15 bc im going out my way to deliver it personally to them instead of meeting them halfway. 

uber delivery (the cost from my address to theirs) 

pick ups (no shipping cost) this one it depends where you live & if you’re underage i don’t recommend at all. meet ups will be a better option like at a busy mall, coffee shops, busy train station anywhere public & busy at good hours

i know this may depend on how big of city you live and how good of transport station you have as well.

in the end the transaction is done through depop & i still get my feedback which is great… apologies for how long this was but i wanted to go into detail & thank you for reading (:

Edit: by ""partner"" I meant ""close friend"". I decided to put the edit here. To add more context, I'm an ace/aro and we are in platonic--at least that's what we call it before he went abroad. I'm so sorry that the word partner confused everyone. Forgive me for using the wrong word and description.

I have known this person for ten years now. We've been together for as long as I could remember. We don't define ourselves as couple since there's no romantic or sexual feeling involved. We just cherish each other presence. Have you ever feel content with sitting in silence? on a call but not talking? Or maybe how you can't feel tired being around them? How you never thought you can connect so deeply with one soul and how they just get you and your thoughts? That's how I feel with him. He played a big part of my life. When I come out to him about my chronical illness, my mental health, my sexuality, my problems, he never brushed me off. Instead he actively asking me what do I need or what he can do to make me feel better or help me through it. We could always talk about everything, I love that we can compromise when we have different opinions. Something I rarely have with someone.

I would never love myself if it's not for him.

He went abroad long before COVID, and this month, he should be coming home. So it would be our first time seeing each other again in real life after years. We already made a whole plan of what we would do and places we'd visit once he's here. We even planned to do Halloween together. But I guess, he already made a plan for himself without me knowing.

Before I found out about his passing, he already went MIA since last July, but he managed to texted me once early August when I was asleep. I thought he got busy or his phone broke since it happened before (we both chronically offline with no social media other than texting app and sometimes reddit). However, just earlier this morning, out of nowhere, I thought of googling his name. Something I never do. And the first thing that popped out on my screen was a condolence post about him. Of course, I was in denial--still is tbh--because I just found out that he's already gone just 2 weeks after his last text.

I still can't believe I just lost the most important person in my life. I know it's no use, but I can't help but asking why, how, and whether he was in pain or not and every other questions. This isn't my first time losing someone so dear to me, but I think, because he was so crucial to my existence, is what make this so hard. I never feel so helpless, confused, and hollowed.

He loves to bake and brewing coffee or tea, and actually really good doing it. He even said he wanted to open a bakery. Maybe, I can try to live on to make his dream come true alongside mine. But I will still going to miss him because I believe nobody could replace him and I would never meet someone like him again. But, I'm afraid one day I would forget his voice. Grief is truly cruel.

I would love to find someone to practice Swedish with and in return help out with some German. I am 25f and recently moved to Munich to live with my boyfriend and study law. 

My level is about B2 and I would be very happy if I could just keep up some conversation practice to avoid forgetting more and more words every day. In return I am a native German speaker and have a pretty good grasp on grammar so I could probably help out depending on where you are in your language journey. 

If you want to meet up for coffee or a walk I would be super happy to hear from you!",2,1729865971.0,munichsocialclub,0,1.0,False

After a month of preparation I am ready to play tomorrow.

The game is a mix of Buffy meets the breakfast club and will have some adapted adventures, as written stuff from 'degrees of horror' and completely new material. 

Students Dana Coffee (the goth)  Lucy heart (the cheerleader) and one of the new janitors Barry 'buzz' Buznik will face supernatural evil together while hopefully getting a passing grade. 

Starting with a two part adventure called 'The art of murder' the group wrestle with the summer school program to get enough credits to allow them entry to University proper. Its 1985 so lets party!

I just graduated from college and while looking for engineering jobs I started working at a local coffee shop. 4 months in I’ve taken their own coffee course, learned to pull shots, make drinks etc. Actually really enjoyed myself and then my career got started. 7+ years later I stumble upon this community, get a starter system, and wake up the rusty skills from forever ago. So when I got this result (with soy milk no less) I was pretty stoked! 

So here’s to all of you for bringing this joy back to my life and all the fun that comes with it. Cheers!",20,1729865743.0,espresso,0,0.92,False

I am about to buy it but wondering if there are better option?

I saw machine with milk compartment. I only drink 2-3 coffee per day.

1. Will it waste lot of milk?

2. Does it require cleaning lot of cleaning every night?

Is there any machine that accept capsule containing both milk and coffee powder premix so it saves me cleaning work?
