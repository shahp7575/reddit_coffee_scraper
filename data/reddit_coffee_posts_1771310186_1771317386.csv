You think depression looks like someone crying in bed all day, right? Wrong. That's the Hollywood version. Real depression? It's way sneakier than that.

I've spent months going down the rabbit hole, reading everything from clinical research to neuroscience podcasts to Reddit threads where people actually tell the truth. What I found? Depression shows up in ways nobody talks about. And most people suffering don't even realize what's happening to them because these signs don't fit the ""sad person"" stereotype.

Here's what the best sources, psychology research, and real human experience taught me about the silent red flags of depression that fly under the radar.

**Step 1: You're not ""lazy,"" your brain is running on fumes**

Everyone thinks procrastination equals laziness. But when you're depressed, it's not that you don't want to do things. Your brain literally cannot generate the energy to initiate tasks. Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman talks about this on his podcast: depression messes with your dopamine system, the chemical responsible for motivation and reward. So when you can't get yourself to shower, answer texts, or do basic tasks, it's not a character flaw. It's your brain struggling to function.

The brutal part? You feel guilty about it, which makes everything worse. You're stuck in this loop of ""Why am I like this?"" when really, your neurochemistry is just tanking.

**Step 2: Everything feels gray, even the good stuff**

This one's insidious. You're not necessarily sad. You just feel... nothing. Psychologists call it anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure. Your favorite song doesn't hit the same. Food tastes like cardboard. Hanging out with friends feels exhausting instead of fun.

Johann Hari's book Lost Connections digs into this hard. He explains that modern depression isn't just chemical, it's also about disconnection from meaning, purpose, and genuine human connection. When life starts feeling like you're going through the motions on autopilot, that's a major sign.

**Book rec:** Lost Connections by Johann Hari. This book will make you question everything you think you know about depression. Hari traveled the world interviewing researchers and people who beat depression, and he breaks down why antidepressants alone don't fix the problem. Insanely good read if you want to understand the bigger picture.

**Step 3: Your body starts screaming at you**

Depression isn't just mental. It shows up physically in ways people ignore. Constant fatigue even after sleeping 10 hours. Random aches and pains. Digestive issues. Tension headaches. Your immune system tanks, so you're getting sick more often.

Dr. Bessel van der Kolk's research in The Body Keeps the Score shows how trauma and mental health issues literally live in your body. Depression rewires your nervous system, keeping you in a constant low-grade stress state. Your body is trying to tell you something's wrong, but we're trained to push through and ignore it.

**Step 4: You're either sleeping 12 hours or not sleeping at all**

Sleep gets absolutely wrecked by depression, but not in the way you think. Some people sleep excessively because their brain is trying to escape reality. Others lie awake for hours, brain spinning on a hamster wheel of anxious thoughts. Both are signs your circadian rhythm and serotonin levels are off.

[Matthew Walker's Why We Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep) breaks down how sleep and mental health are locked in this vicious cycle. Bad mental health destroys sleep, bad sleep destroys mental health. If your sleep patterns are all over the place, don't ignore it.

**Step 5: You're rage-scrolling and binge-watching everything**

Here's the thing nobody talks about: excessive screen time isn't just a bad habit. It's often a coping mechanism for depression. Your brain craves that quick dopamine hit from scrolling, clicking, watching. But it's a band-aid over a bullet wound.

Cal Newport's Digital Minimalism explains how constant digital stimulation creates a shallow, distracted life that makes depression worse. When you're mindlessly consuming content for hours, you're avoiding the real work of dealing with what's underneath.

**App rec:** Try Finch. It's a self-care app that gamifies mental health in the least annoying way possible. You take care of a little bird by completing daily self-care tasks. Sounds cheesy, but it actually helps build tiny habits when everything feels impossible. 

If you want something that addresses the root patterns behind these feelings, there's also [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450). It's a personalized learning app built by AI researchers from Google and Columbia that pulls insights from psychology books, clinical research, and expert interviews to create custom audio content based on your specific struggles. You can tell it exactly what you're dealing with, like ""managing depression as someone who isolates"" or ""breaking free from doomscrolling,"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan with episodes ranging from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. The voice options are genuinely addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic one that makes heavy topics easier to absorb. Way better than mindlessly scrolling.

**Step 6: You're isolating, but pretending you're fine**

This is the killer. You cancel plans. You don't reply to texts. You avoid calls. But when someone asks if you're okay, you say ""Yeah, I'm good, just busy."" You're not busy. You're hiding.

Depression makes human connection feel unbearable. But isolation feeds depression like gasoline on a fire. The research is clear: social disconnection is as harmful to your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. That's from studies cited in Susan Pinker's work on longevity and connection.

The trick depression plays is convincing you that people don't care or that you're a burden. That's the illness talking, not reality.

**Step 7: You're stuck in thought loops you can't escape**

Your brain becomes a broken record. Replaying past mistakes. Catastrophizing about the future. Obsessing over things you said three years ago. Rumination is a classic depression symptom, but people think it's just ""overthinking.""

Ethan Kross's book [Chatter](https://www.ethankross.com/) dives deep into the science of inner voice and mental loops. He explains how rumination literally changes your brain structure over time, making it harder to break free. The good news? There are techniques that actually work to interrupt these patterns.

**Step 8: You're functioning, but barely**

This is high-functioning depression, and it's dangerous because nobody sees it. You're going to work, paying bills, keeping up appearances. But inside, you're dying. Every task feels like moving through concrete.

Therapists call this ""smiling depression."" On the outside, you look fine. On the inside, you're drowning. And because you're ""functioning,"" people, including yourself, don't take it seriously.

**Step 9: Small things feel catastrophic**

Spilled coffee? Day ruined. Minor criticism? Spirals into self-hatred. Your emotional regulation is shot. Things that wouldn't normally bother you feel like the end of the world.

This happens because depression messes with your prefrontal cortex, the part of your brain responsible for rational thinking and emotional control. Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett's research on emotions explains how our brains construct feelings based on context, and when you're depressed, everything gets filtered through a lens of hopelessness.

**Step 10: You're self-medicating without realizing it**

Drinking more. Smoking weed constantly. Overeating or not eating. Shopping binges. Excessive exercise. These aren't just bad habits. They're often attempts to manage unbearable internal pain.

Gabor MatÃ©'s work, especially in In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, explores how addiction and compulsive behaviors are coping mechanisms for deeper suffering. If you're reaching for something to numb out regularly, that's your brain screaming for help.

**What actually helps:**

Look, I'm not going to feed you the ""just exercise and meditate"" line. That stuff can help, but when you're deep in it, being told to go for a jog feels insulting.

What the research actually shows works: therapy (especially CBT or ACT), sometimes medication, rebuilding social connections, fixing sleep, moving your body in any way that doesn't feel torturous, and most importantly, understanding that your brain is stuck in a pattern that can be interrupted.

**Resource rec:** The Huberman Lab podcast episodes on depression and mental health. Andrew Huberman breaks down the actual neuroscience in a way that makes sense. Understanding what's happening in your brain takes away some of the shame.

Depression isn't a character flaw. It's not weakness. It's your brain chemistry, your environment, your nervous system, and sometimes your biology all conspiring against you. The system we live in, constant stress, disconnection, it all plays a role. But here's the thing: once you recognize these signs, you can start doing something about it.

You're not broken. Your brain is just stuck. And stuck things can get unstuck.

For context the female (who is called L) in question is my deceased partners younger sister. We had been together since we were 14 and in high school. We never married and had no kids but always dreamed and spoke of those future occasions. She suffered with mental health most of her life and ultimately decided in 2020 that she couldn’t live anymore. It of course shocked all of us. I knew she was struggling and I was doing my best to be the supportive partner for her but with the socialising restrictions due to Covid it took a bigger toll on her than I realised. Her family were there for me as I was for them. I had lost my father only two years before, then had to sell my flat and move back into my mums so it was a tough few years for me. L helped a lot making sure I went to my therapy sessions and looked out for me even though she had her own life going on and was only 19 turning 20. As covid ended in 2021 and I was able to socialise with my usual circle of friends, the two of us drifted slightly. She was living her life and I was living mine. We still kept in occasional contact as I did with her parents and elder sister. She looked to have started settling down in 2023 when she had her daughter. I was grateful that the family ensured I was part of the celebrations and the kept inviting me to family gatherings. I attended some but not all as I felt I shouldn’t be hanging around otherwise I wouldn’t move on from my partner. L would seem disappointed when she would ask why I wasn’t attending but understood. 

Unfortunately for her, the child’s father decided in January 2024 that he no longer wanted to be a family and took off. As we proceeded further into 2024 I began dating. At first I was unsure whether to say to the family as a sign of respect. I spoke to L to see what she would think. She has the type of personality where she has no filter in a good way. She suggested I go for it as I was still under 30 and had my whole life in front of me. So I did. Unfortunately for me on the few dates I went on I just felt numb inside. I would engage with the dates but my mind would drift off to my partner mid conversation. I felt awful that I was doing this to these women. Over the final period of 2024 and first period of 2025 me and L were hanging out more. We would meet for coffee during the week where she would bring her daughter along and occasionally just us two would go to the cinema and dinner on a Friday or Saturday night. As she was a single parent, last summer I offered to look after her daughter on a few individual days as she wanted to go to a few music festivals. She appreciated the offer and I kept my 

offer. 

During last summer there was a family fall out between L, the elder sister and their parents. My name was brought up as the eldest believed I didn’t do enough for my partner. L and her parents defended me where an accusation of a romantic relationship between me and L was made. I won’t go into more detail but the result is now the eldest sister speaks to no one. By the time Christmas comes the parents invited me and my mum round for Christmas dinner. As we were spending time with our own extended family we politely rejected. But I did pop round to see L on Christmas Eve. We spent a few hours reminiscing about past Christmas’s and how my partner loved decorating the house. It was a great evening where even though some tears were shed laughs were had too. 

As the first few weeks of 2026 come along, L started calling and texting me more regularly throughout the day. She would ask about my day so on so forth. I didn’t really think much of it. We were still meeting up every week for a morning coffee and for two out of five of the weekends in January we went to the cinema. Then last Monday L phones me asking what I was doing Friday. My reply was not much. She suggested we do a friend’s valentines. I jokingly laughed but agreed after she explained herself better. Friday evening was going smoothly we enjoyed ourselves at a lovely Italian restaurant in central London where more on my behalf a awkward moment was shared when the waiter asked us how long we had been a couple, but she played it off smoothly. Afterwards I traveled on the tube and bus back to her flat. No romantic intention was meant but as she had a bit to drink and my hands were cold I had her link arms as we walked from the bus stop to hers. As we said bye to eachother she said that she had deep feelings for me that she’s had for nearly a year. I was shocked and didn’t respond great. I reminded her of who she was and who I was and the only reason we know eachother is because of her sister. She then drunkenly laughed and said she was messing around. At that moment to stop any words being exchanged I guided her into her block of flats and to her front door which is where I said my goodbyes. I text her Saturday morning to try and grasp what the atmosphere was like. She replied back promptly with a short response. Once again I left it at that. But Sunday she phoned me asking why I hadn’t text back Saturday. I was slightly confused as I felt it didn’t require a response. It was then halfway through the chat that she repeated what she had said Friday night. This time it had a more serious tone to it. I knew she wasn’t messing around. Since 2:00pm Sunday afternoon it’s all I’ve thought about. She text me a few times yesterday but I just don’t know what to say to her. I don’t believe, even if I think deeply, that I am looking for a relationship especially one that could be construed as being complicated or “wrong. But I do care for L and don’t want to see her hurt and especially don’t want to be the one hurting her. As I said at the beginning of my post I was not married to her sister. But she was my high school sweetheart and the one person I always believed I’d share a life with.

I know it’s coming up to six years but I’m not sure if I’ll ever get over losing her. But at what point do I accept it’s time to close that chapter and move on? Do I listen to what L says and search in myself if I have those same feelings. I love spending time with her and having the companionship but being romantically involved has never crossed my mind. Should I see what she has to say in more detail? Do I just shutdown what she says and disassociate myself from her and her parents? If anyone has advice what I should do that would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR 

My deceased partners sister confessed she had feelings for me over the weekend. She has had them for nearly a year. Her sister/my partner passed away nearly six years ago and we were unwed and had no children. Unsure where I should take what L said to me",2,1771316946.0,relationships,0,0.75,False

1r70hga,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1r70hga/beginners_experience_with_v60/,Beginner's experience with V60,"Hi everyone, long time lurker here. After years of experiencing espresso-based coffee in cafés only, I decided to finally buy my own brewing pourover gear at the beginning of this year.  
I have Fellow Ode with gen 2 burrs, plastic V60 with a server and gooseneck electric kettle from a local, affordable brand with a sufficient temp control (1 °C precision).

I've watched a lot of Hoffmann's videos before I started, the ultimate V60 methods, I read a lot of this sub, I watched another half of coffee youtube from other authors (but tbh I found Hoffmann's approach the most ""beginner-friendly""). Let's just say I feel like my head is stuffed with so much new ino which I can't properly synthesise into something properly useful yet. Just a lot of disconnected ideas, advice and all of it at once and many times contradicting one another. It is for sure a lot to take in and test out.

My first problem was: as a person who drank espresso and espresso-based milk coffees my whole life, I had no benchmark of ""what does good pour over coffee taste like"" in my head. Like, flat white, my favorite drink so far, is just sweet and mellow with a strong coffee kick underneath. How should I know when the pour over black coffee is too sour or already too bitter? Compared to what exactly? Coffee is a classic acquired taste and this is the one style of the taste which I never acquired. Unfortunately, not a chance to try the pour over in a café where I live, not a popular option at all.

So here I was, just buying a lot of expensive coffee, brewed more or less confidently with a lot of highly mixed results. I start grinding each new coffee at 5.0 on Ode (producer's recommended value for pour over after calibration). I also saw the general consensus here, that beginners tend to grind too fine and they should go a bit coarser for proper taste clarity, so I was careful not to go too fine, usually trying things out in a range of 4.2 - 6.0.

After some time, I built some benchmark in my head of 'what does it mean sour', 'what does it mean bitter', 'oh, now it's even a bit salty?!'. Let me say this: I wasted a lot of good coffee on my initial experiments and I'm not even sure I'm so much wiser for it to be honest, haha.

Many times I had a very confusing experience. Like, I would brew the coffee, and would be blown away and think to myself 'ooooh, that hit the spot, what a great taste right off the bat'. But then I'd brew exactly the same coffee in exactly the same way the next day and I'd be like 'wth? Why is this coffee so sour suddenly and half of the tastes are not even there?'.

I doubted my tastebuds, I doubted my recipe (which is Hoffmann's single cup recipe, so why the hell would I doubt someone, who is so much more experienced than me), or my skill.

So anyway, I have this Kenyan fruity coffee, which I managed to get a great result with on my first brew and then could NEVER replicate this great result later. I gave some of it away to my friend, who brews coffee for much longer than me, but he's also self-taught amateur with an absolute disregard for any coffee theory. He told me the coffe was mid and he didn't taste almost any of the notes written on the bag. This saved my sanity a bit, as I was thinking I'm the only person in the world, who can't do this properly.

So, to finish this long, weird post off with the experience which made me write this in the first place. This morning I woke up with one thought: 'screw it, I'm gonna boldly grind fine, where I haven't ground before, and if I still get the mid coffee experience, then maybe simply the pour over is overhyped, or I'm bad at it and so be it'. I set my grinder to 4.0, brewed the coffee, tasted. Well, not only was it NOT bitter, but the sweetness was much more pronounced! It tasted good, surprisingly different from the moments where I managed to brew a good coffee before. All the tastes were well melted into one pleasant, sweet, fruity, flowery experience, which I haven't tasted in coffee before. On the other hand, it was hard to distinguish singular notes, not as easily as when I ground coarser and somehow managed to get good results by accident. Still, if I can get this morning's experience consistently only cause I ground finer, then I guess so be it? It's pleasant enough and much less frustrating experience than the coarse setting slot machine of 'will I get a good coffee this time'.

I don't know if there is any point to this post. I guess there is none, I just needed to talk about something that bothers me, is all. I'm having a lot of fun and joy out of this new hobby of mine. But also surprisingly much frustration as well. I was never a coffee geek, just a normal person enjoying a cup from time to time and now I'm obsessing over some piece of plastic packed with a sheet of paper, trying to find the reasons for what it does to my coffee.

I guess happy brewing to you all and sending you wishes of consistent brews every single time! Cheers!",1,1771316465.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Yeah, me too. I’ve been on a mission lately to bring that subtly dramatic vibe into everyday life without looking like I'm headed to a costume party or spending my entire morning blending. My latest experiment? A quick, lived-in dark lip and smudged liner that actually felt *doable* for grabbing coffee or a library run.

Here's a peek into what I tried:

*   **The Vibe:** Leaning into a 'literary gothic' meets 'chaotic curator' feel—a bit undone, slightly mysterious, like you've just emerged from a deep thought with ink on your fingers.
*   **My Tools for This Round:**
    *   **Lips:** Wet n Wild MegaLast Lip Color in *Black Orchid* (~$2.99). This shade is a deep, vampy berry that can lean purple. Not for the faint of heart, but incredibly striking.
    *   **Eyes:** NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in *Black Bean* (~$5.00) and a cheap, cool-toned brown matte eyeshadow (I grabbed an old single from ColourPop, but any similar shade works).
    *   **Face:** Just my usual light base and a touch of blush. No heavy contouring here.
*   **The (Imperfect) Process:**
    *   **Eyes (5 mins):** I actually started here, which is usually backwards for me. I smudged the NYX Black Bean pencil along my upper lash line, not trying for precision at all, then used my pinky finger to blend it out and up slightly, creating a soft, smoky wash. Next, I took a tiny bit of the cool brown eyeshadow on a dense brush and tapped it over the smudged liner to set it and add a little depth, focusing on the outer corners. No perfect wings, no sharp lines – just a shadowy gaze.
    *   **Lips (7 mins):** This was the trickiest part. Instead of going for a super crisp dark lip, I applied *Black Orchid* directly from the bullet, focusing on the center, then used a clean finger to gently blur and smudge the edges, creating a softer, slightly diffused look. A few dabs of concealer on my finger helped clean up any major wayward smudges, but I intentionally left it a little imperfect. The goal was 'just been kissed' by a ghost, not 'perfectly painted.'
*   **Total Time:** Around 12-15 minutes, tops.

Okay, so let’s get real. The first time I tried this exact combo, I looked less like a brooding poet and more like I’d just eaten a crayon. The dark lip can be *intense*, especially when you're used to nudes or brights. My big discovery? The smudged, imperfect application is actually key to making it wearable for daylight. Trying to achieve a super crisp, perfectly outlined dark lip when you’re rushing can just lead to frustration and uneven edges. Embracing the slight messiness was liberating. Plus, I was genuinely surprised by how much *less* intimidating a dark lip felt when the rest of my face was kept minimal and the eyes were just softly defined. It wasn't about being flawless; it was about the mood.

-Mornings, wash my face, then I use a cerave ""renewing SA cleanser"" that has ceramides and salicylic acid
-Then I rinse it off, then I apply the Naturium azelaic acid on my face, wait a few minutes for my skin to absorb it and dry, 
-Then I apply a Cera ve PM facial moisturizer, that has niacinamide and hylouranic acid 
-Then I apply a eucerin sun screen that contains hylouranic acid

Since July I've used Naturium Azelaic Acid 10% with coffAzelaic Topical Acid 10% it contains niacinamide coffee seed extract and vitamin C

But for a few months I noticed almost no changes at all, very little, until early January, I finally saw these spots were way faded compared to months ago when they were way more pinkish red

But I'm not sure if the fading is from the serum finally working, or natural healing. Either way, the fading seems to have stopped, it's stayed this color for a month now

My question is, should I still use the azelaic acid? I was on my way to purchase my 4th bottle, but then I saw  Retinol Complex Serum which also contains Vitamin E, bakuchiol. And I read that Retinol serum is better for red pinkish spots?",1,1771316194.0,Skincare_Addiction,1,1.0,False

Now read this,"This will be rather lengthy and no TLDR, so if you are not willing to read long texts, this is not for you.  
The rest, grab a cup of coffee.

  
I posted an [informational post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calibre/comments/1r69x90/justread_ios_your_calibre_companion_is_launching/), being the developer of the app. And 90% of the (valuable) responses were about price. That's understandable and I am glad for it. But there were other answers about ""guarantees not abandoning the app"".

And this got me thinking almost the whole night.

As you are r/calibre users I guess you read a lot. So putting yourself in someone else's shoes shouldn't be problem for you.

Additional info: I also posted a few weeks ago a post [only about price](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calibre/comments/1q83dnh/question_for_calibre_and_android_users_reading_on/), just for android users.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looks like the general consensus is that apps should have price as low as possible, ideally free. I am with you on this, as a user.  
And also that the developer should guarantee not abandoning the app and ideally be active in the development, fixing bugs, updating the app, adding features.

Past Marvin3 and Kybook users, now raise your hands.

Now I would like to kindly ask you to use your imagination.  
  
Imagine you are the developer and you developed an app. Not necessary [justread.app](http://justread.app) for reading, but something else for hobby you like (knitting, photography, wood working, running, sauna, ...).  
  
You developed it for a reason and almost every time the reason is that you don't have what you need/want in what is existing on the market. Then you spent months working. In the beginning you are doing it only for yourself. To solve your own problems and needs. Who cares about others, right. But you put a word out, got a little feedback here and there and you decide to put the app into public.  
Then you got a lot of feedback. You start adding features that you originally wasn't planning. But now the app will not be just for you, but also for others. So you start thinking about maybe making some money out of it, right? The users will be using your effort and also you added features you did not want to for yourself, you added it for others.

So, now, if you have these scenarios about pricing...

1. app for free  
2. app for a fixed one-time price  
3. app for subscription

... and you release the app to public, to store.

Which option will tie you more to the future good of the app?  
With which option you feel no remorse, when you abandon the app if you need to?  
With which option you even feel you will be actively developing the app in the future not wanting to abandon it?  
If you like statistics, can you make some educated guess what is the abandonment rate for these three options?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I know you hate subscriptions, but I think that subscriptions are the best gun you can have to point at developers head to make him guarantee to not abandon the app.  


In my humble opinion...  
If you put the app for free, who cares if you abandon the development? You got it here for free... take it or leave it.  
If you put the app for a one time price, you are rethinking ongoing development, when the pool of new users starts to plummet. I do not say you abandon it, but again, Marvin and Kybook are good examples here.  
But if you have users who are paying you for using the app continuously, you even don't want to abandon the app. Bookfusion with its subscription tier is the example. You want to continue development.  
  
My final point here is that those damned and hated subscriptions are the best way **for users** to have the best guarantee the app will not be abandoned and will be actively developed.

Now I would like to really hear to all the hate you will answer me, because I think there will be some valuable things.",0,1771316169.0,Calibre,3,0.25,False

1r70c8c,https://v.redd.it/vz6mmttlj0kg1,Feature spotlight: BreakTime — smart break reminders that actually know when you're away,"Hey r/getmacty!

Wanted to do a deeper dive into one of the newer Macty features — **BreakTime**.

### The problem

If you're anything like me, you sit down to debug something ""real quick"" and suddenly it's been 4 hours. No water, no breaks, eyes burning. I've tried break reminder apps before — the problem is they always feel dumb. They interrupt you during lunch. They fire when your laptop's been closed for an hour. They don't know the difference between ""focused at the keyboard"" and ""already taking a break.""

### What BreakTime does differently

It's a 3-tier system based on how your body actually works:

- **Eye breaks** — every 20 min, look away for 20 seconds (the 20-20-20 rule). Auto-dismisses so you're not clicking buttons every time
- **Micro breaks** — every 60 min, 5 min to stretch. Suggests specific activities
- **Rest breaks** — every 2 hours, 15 min to actually walk around

### The smart part

- **Idle detection** — if you lock your screen, close the lid, or just walk away, timers pause automatically. No phantom breaks.
- **Smart wake** — gone for 15+ minutes? Timers reset completely. Quick coffee run? Picks up where you left off.
- **Quiet hours** — set a window (e.g., 10 PM - 8 AM) and BreakTime goes silent
- **Snooze budget** — 3 snoozes per day, 5 minutes each. Enough to finish a thought, not enough to skip every break

### Streaks and hydration

- Track how many breaks you complete vs skip each day
- Maintain a streak (need 70% completion to keep it going)
- Water tracking built in — log glasses during breaks, set a daily goal

### How to enable

Settings > BreakTime tab > toggle on. Everything is customizable — intervals, durations, strictness level, sounds.

he ended up becoming physically aggressive towards me and me only. he was still very handsy with me at this point. but the first time i really was shook was when i came back from the gym one night and he went on this tirade about the orientation of the light switches (so stupid i know) and to spite him i kept flipping them the other way, and he took it upon himself to physically restrain me, manhandle me to my room and pinned me onto my bed, multiple times, lecturing me about the switches. i freaked out and told him to stop and to put me down and to not touch me. which he didn’t listen to. i couldn’t really force him off of me either since he was bigger and stronger than me.

the second time, i was being goofy and took his hat that was on the table and set it somewhere else, tryna be slick, and he took it the wrong way and started putting his hands all over me to which i told him to stop touching me, which once again he didn’t.

the last time was when he tripped a breaker while i was cooking something and i went to reset it cause the panel’s in my room and he came out insisting to check something with it and i told him i fixed it which he didn’t like and once again, he manhandled me and pinned me against the wall.

at this point i was sick and tired of his shit and him constantly touching me and my stuff, and i finally told my parents to which they didn’t like this and were so angry wanted me to move out, but i didn’t want to because my other roommate was my best friend and i didn’t want to lose that. but i ended up moving out anyway. the times i tried talking to him and why he would always target me and not our other roommate he would always say that “our relationship was different and me and (m21) wasn’t like that” even though on multiple times i told him DO NOT touch me or my stuff even when he wasn’t being aggressive. he just never listened to me or my boundaries.

i guess what i’m wishing and hoping is how i can move past this and just be at peace with the decision i made and not ruminating over it constantly wondering i was complicit in his actions, i.e., poking the bear. we don’t talk anymore, he never apologized, reached out, asked why i moved out, just radio silence. but now i live in a different townhouse 4 doors down with new roommates and i still see my best friend (m21) constantly but i keep wondering if i brought it onto myself since i engaged with him being handsy or whatever in the beginning and even started some of the shit. or if he actually was being an aggressive asshole with anger and control issues. i just hate how i had a place where i had my friend and someone i could see constantly be ripped away from me and they still live together with no issues with a new roommate while my parents kinda ripped me out of there and i’m stuck in a townhouse with randoms i don’t even really vibe with. i just miss living with my best friend and sometimes it’s so isolating cause my roommates now are never here and there’s no spontaneity anymore, anytime my friend does come over, he always goes back and we just don’t see each other as much as we did. idk maybe i’m just nostalgic and sad for the past or something. but i keep getting hung up over this and it’s been giving me major issues and honestly made me really resentful towards the guy and wish it ended up differently.",1,1771315824.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

last full day

day 10 (sunday)

flight at 8:45pm

--------------------------------------------


couple questions / concerns i had were;

* i want to keep car rental days on the same day as possible. because parking at the HHV is $70/day. so we WONT be parking there. Is there an option where we can do a daily car rental? or an option that DOESNT charge us for parking? (i remember i saw a thread on reddit about it... but i cant find it anymore) how good of an option is Turo?

* on day 1, we first plan to start the day with the diamond head hike. we DONT have reef safe sunscreen. is it ok to use standard sunscreen if we WONT be going into the beach? (plan is to buy reef safe sunscreen and anything else we may need including boardshorts after the hike + Kapi’olani Park before heading back to hotel to wash up)

* any decent place to buy boardshorts we can use for snorkerling, beach activities, lounging at pool, etc?

* Day 4. i have a meeting i CANT miss no matter what that starts at 12:30pm and ends at around 3pm. whats something we can do before then, as well as after? should we move some other things around from other days to this day?

* for day 5, i think this is a tricky day? we plan on starting the day with the Ocean voyage thats on gocity pass. as early as possible (i think thats 8:40am) i heard good things about the UTV tour but my mom is not a fan. but also she has asthma and everyones saying its super dusty. i am also not a fan of the though of it being super dusty. nor it being very muddy. especially since its not going to be the end of our day. So instead, we're thinking of doing the Kualoa Secret Island beach half day thats on gocity. is this worth it?

* with day 5, will we have enough time to check out Hoomaluhia garden and byodin temple since they close at 4pm? (Either Ocean voyage tour + Haflday secret island tour. or Ocean voyage tour + 1hour UTV tour. the latter definitely seems possible. but not sure about the first option.)

* day 6 any recommendations on what to check out / do at Kapolei?

* based on this schedule, we still have 2 full days left. there are some things i left out on a list of things we looked up for hawaii. but wondering if we should just leave it blank? i assume some things will go out of whack and everything wont necessarily go according to plan. so having 2 days buffer seems fine?",1,1771315705.0,VisitingHawaii,4,1.0,False

Advice needed please,"Firstly apologies if this is not the correct sub Reddit. I’ve spent all night trying to look for the one that seems best.

For context the female (who is called L) in question is my deceased partners younger sister. We had been together since we were 14 and in high school. We never married and had no kids but always dreamed and spoke of those future occasions. She suffered with mental health most of her life and ultimately decided in 2020 that she couldn’t live anymore. It of course shocked all of us. I knew she was struggling and I was doing my best to be the supportive partner for her but with the socialising restrictions due to Covid it took a bigger toll on her than I realised. Her family were there for me as I was for them. I had lost my father only two years before, then had to sell my flat and move back into my mums so it was a tough few years for me. L helped a lot making sure I went to my therapy sessions and looked out for me even though she had her own life going on and was only 19 turning 20. As covid ended in 2021 and I was able to socialise with my usual circle of friends, the two of us drifted slightly. She was living her life and I was living mine. We still kept in occasional contact as I did with her parents and elder sister. She looked to have started settling down in 2023 when she had her daughter. I was grateful that the family ensured I was part of the celebrations and the kept inviting me to family gatherings. I attended some but not all as I felt I shouldn’t be hanging around otherwise I wouldn’t move on from my partner. L would seem disappointed when she would ask why I wasn’t attending but understood. 

Unfortunately for her, the child’s father decided in January 2024 that he no longer wanted to be a family and took off. As we proceeded further into 2024 I began dating. At first I was unsure whether to say to the family as a sign of respect. I spoke to L to see what she would think. She has the type of personality where she has no filter in a good way. She suggested I go for it as I was still under 30 and had my whole life in front of me. So I did. Unfortunately for me on the few dates I went on I just felt numb inside. I would engage with the dates but my mind would drift off to my partner mid conversation. I felt awful that I was doing this to these women. Over the final period of 2024 and first period of 2025 me and L were hanging out more. We would meet for coffee during the week where she would bring her daughter along and occasionally just us two would go to the cinema and dinner on a Friday or Saturday night. As she was a single parent, last summer I offered to look after her daughter on a few individual days as she wanted to go to a few music festivals. She appreciated the offer and I kept my 

offer. 

During last summer there was a family fall out between L, the elder sister and their parents. My name was brought up as the eldest believed I didn’t do enough for my partner. L and her parents defended me where an accusation of a romantic relationship between me and L was made. I won’t go into more detail but the result is now the eldest sister speaks to no one. By the time Christmas comes the parents invited me and my mum round for Christmas dinner. As we were spending time with our own extended family we politely rejected. But I did pop round to see L on Christmas Eve. We spent a few hours reminiscing about past Christmas’s and how my partner loved decorating the house. It was a great evening where even though some tears were shed laughs were had too. 

As the first few weeks of 2026 come along, L started calling and texting me more regularly throughout the day. She would ask about my day so on so forth. I didn’t really think much of it. We were still meeting up every week for a morning coffee and for two out of five of the weekends in January we went to the cinema. Then last Monday L phones me asking what I was doing Friday. My reply was not much. She suggested we do a friend’s valentines. I jokingly laughed but agreed after she explained herself better. Friday evening was going smoothly we enjoyed ourselves at a lovely Italian restaurant in central London where more on my behalf a awkward moment was shared when the waiter asked us how long we had been a couple, but she played it off smoothly. Afterwards I traveled on the tube and bus back to her flat. No romantic intention was meant but as she had a bit to drink and my hands were cold I had her link arms as we walked from the bus stop to hers. As we said bye to eachother she said that she had deep feelings for me that she’s had for nearly a year. I was shocked and didn’t respond great. I reminded her of who she was and who I was and the only reason we know eachother is because of her sister. She then drunkenly laughed and said she was messing around. At that moment to stop any words being exchanged I guided her into her block of flats and to her front door which is where I said my goodbyes. I text her Saturday morning to try and grasp what the atmosphere was like. She replied back promptly with a short response. Once again I left it at that. But Sunday she phoned me asking why I hadn’t text back Saturday. I was slightly confused as I felt it didn’t require a response. It was then halfway through the chat that she repeated what she had said Friday night. This time it had a more serious tone to it. I knew she wasn’t messing around. Since 2:00pm Sunday afternoon it’s all I’ve thought about. She text me a few times yesterday but I just don’t know what to say to her. I don’t believe, even if I think deeply, that I am looking for a relationship especially one that could be construed as being complicated or “wrong. But I do care for L and don’t want to see her hurt and especially don’t want to be the one hurting her. As I said at the beginning of my post I was not married to her sister. But she was my high school sweetheart and the one person I always believed I’d share a life with.

I know it’s coming up to six years but I’m not sure if I’ll ever get over losing her. But at what point do I accept it’s time to close that chapter and move on? Do I listen to what L says and search in myself if I have those same feelings. I love spending time with her and having the companionship but being romantically involved has never crossed my mind. Should I see what she has to say in more detail? Do I just shutdown what she says and disassociate myself from her and her parents? If anyone has advice what I should do that would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR 

My deceased partners sister confessed she had feelings for me over the weekend. She has had them for nearly a year. Her sister/my partner passed away nearly six years ago and we were unwed and had no children. Unsure where I should take what L said to me",2,1771315368.0,widowers,0,1.0,False

Let's share tips to conquer the chaos!,"Ever feel like your inbox is a monster that just keeps growing, no matter how many times you try to tame it? One second you’re sipping your morning coffee, and the next, there are 150 new messages from Allegro, your online store, and all your social media platforms. It's like a never-ending game of email whack-a-mole!

Here's the thing: every minute your customer service team spends figuring out what each message is about is a minute not spent on actual sales or building those oh-so-important customer relationships. It’s like trying to juggle with one hand tied behind your back. So, what do you do?

Let me drop some knowledge bombs:

1. Prioritize messages by urgency and importance. Teach your team to quickly identify which messages need immediate attention and which can chill in the queue for a bit.
2. Use canned responses for common inquiries. This frees up time to tackle more pressing issues and keeps things moving at a steady pace.
3. Implement clear categorization and tagging. This way, your team can instantly know what type of issue they’re dealing with, making it easier to assign the right agent.

Now, if you're looking for a way to streamline this whole process, you might want to check out tools that offer personalized AI contexts. For instance, Base has some nifty features like personalized AI contexts in their Responso tool, which can help make sense of the chaos in your inbox and streamline customer interactions without breaking a sweat.

So, Reddit fam, what’s your strategy for handling inbox overload? Any tips or tools that have made a difference for you? Let's swap some war stories and tips in the comments!",1,1771315230.0,basecom,1,1.0,False

PTSD for Three Years. Plot Twist: It Was All Cap

My hero cop husband got t0rtured for a month saving some hostage girl.

When he got out? Covered in scars. Couldn't even perform in bed.

""It's trauma. Don't push him."" Doctor's orders.

So I played the perfect wife for three years.

Drained every penny on his treatments.

Worked two jobs to pay for that poor girl's tuition.

Slept on the couch for just because ""the se//x triggered his PTSD.""

Until at his award ceremony, someone played the wrong video.

There's my ""broken"" husband—

Bending that girl over a desk, going at it like a animal.

""You like that? Say my name. Beg for it.""

""Good girl. Take it all.""

Grunting. Moaning. Zero problems performing.

He lunged to cover my eyes.

""Baby don't look! I had to make that mafia boss trust me!""

""He was watching! It was just part of the mission!""

""Tech team!"" 

""Who played that video! Shut it off NOW!""

Captain Marcus Webb's shout exploded across the auditorium.

The blinding light vanished from the screen, and the whole hall went dark and silent.

I sat frozen with ice-cold hands.

The hand covering my eyes smelled like his cigars—familiar. 

But that same hand was just gripping another girl's hair on that screen seconds ago.

""Evelyn. Don't look.""

Grayson's voice stayed steady in my ear, but something was tight underneath.

I didn't move or speak. 

My fingers twisted my dress into a hard knot—my nervous habit.

The lights slammed back on and everyone's eyes locked onto me like spotlights. 

Pity. Curiosity. Disgust. Schadenfreude.

Grayson dropped his hand and pulled off his uniform jacket to drape over my trembling shoulders.

""Just a misunderstanding. Special interrogation tactic.""

He said it loud enough for everyone to hear, calm as ever.

""Please continue. Don't let this ruin the ceremony.""

Like that se//x footage wasn't just broadcast to the entire department.

Captain Webb rushed over with guilt written all over his face.

""Evelyn, you okay? Those tech idi0ts screwed up. I'll deal with them.""

He looked at me like a worried father.

For three years the whole department knew about Grayson's condition. 

They knew I quit my job to care for him.

To them I was the saint, the selfless cop's wife.

Now I was the punchline.

""I'm fine, Captain.""

Grayson's arm locked around my shoulders, heavy and possessive.

""I'm taking her home.""

He didn't give anyone a chance to ask questions and walked us straight out.

Cold air hit me in the corridor and I shivered.

In the car, he finally let go. 

His scent—sweat and something wild—made my stomach turn.

I stared out the window.

""That was fake."" He started the engine.

""What was fake?""

""The video. I was playing a role to gain the dealer's trust.""

His explanation came out smooth and flawless.

""That girl Aria was in deep. I had to use special tactics or she wouldn't talk. I thought that footage was destroyed.""

He glanced at me while driving.

""I know this is hard, but it was my job. You need to understand.""

Understand.

That word again.

For three years I understood his trauma, his condition, every fragile piece of him. 

But I can't understand how he could screw another woman on a desk, when touching me felt like t0rture to him.

The car stopped outside our building.

I didn't move.

Grayson unbuckled and leaned closer, his face right there with those exhausted eyes.

""Stop being upset, okay?"" His voice went soft and coaxing. 

""Aria's waiting upstairs. She's scared after today.""

Ice water dumped over my head.

I whipped around and stared at him.

""Why is she in our house?""

Grayson's face darkened and irritation flashed in his eyes.

""She's scared living alone. Moved in a few days ago.""

""I thought I told you.""

He said it like it was obvious, like this wasn't my home, but some motel he could let anyone crash in.

I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms.

He never told me. He never said a word.

I shoved the car door open and stumbled toward the building.

It took me several tries to get the key in the lock.

The door swung open and a wave of unfamiliar perfume hit me in the face.

By the entrance sat a pair of pink heels that weren't mine.

A woman's jacket was tossed on the couch.

Half-eaten snacks and a fashion magazine covered the coffee table.

Everything screamed that another woman lived here now.

Aria walked out of the master bedroom wearing my silk nightgown.

The one I bought for my birthday and never had the heart to wear.

Now it hung loose on her thin frame with the neckline gaping open, showing off a trail of red marks.

""Grayson! Evelyn! You're back!""

She froze like a startled rabbit, clutching the collar.

""I'm so sorry, Evelyn. Your nightgown..."" 

""All my clothes are in the wash. Grayson said I could borrow yours.""

She looked at me with those teary puppy eyes, like I was the villain invading her space.

Grayson walked in, casually taking the glass from her hand and drinking.

""Scared, huh? It's okay now.""

He ruffled her hair—tender, natural, intimate.

That kind of tenderness—I'd only seen it when he first came back from the mission at his most broken.

""I'll make dinner.""

I threw out the words and bolted into the kitchen.

Cold water ran over my hands, but I felt nothing. 

My body bu//rned from the inside out like lit cotton.

I could hear them talking in low voices.

""Grayson, is Evelyn mad? This is all my fault—"" Aria's voice cracked.

""Don't overthink it. She just needs time."" Grayson's voice was low.

""You had a rough day. Go rest.""

""But I'm scared. Every time I close my eyes I see that footage...""

""Then I'll stay with you for a bit.""

The door clicked shut.

I turned off the faucet and leaned against the cold counter, shaking all over.

So he wasn't broken.

He just didn't work for me.

I made dinner—three dishes and soup, all his favorites.

At the table I didn't serve him like I usually did.

The silence was suffocating.

Aria kept her head down, eating in tiny b!tes, her eyes red-rimmed.

Grayson barely touched his food before pushing his plate away.

""I'm full.""

He stood up and pulled a thick stack of bills from his wallet, dropping it on the table.

""This month's living expenses. Let me know if it's not enough.""

I stared at the crisp bills and felt a sharp sting.

When did we become this?

""Is that where Aria's tuition and rent money comes from too?""

The question slipped out before I could stop it.

Grayson froze and turned to look at me with cold eyes.

""She's a girl with no one. Helping her is only right.""

""Evelyn, I didn't think you were this petty.""

Petty?

I drained our savings for his so-called condition.

I sold my mother's jewelry to pay for his poor girl's education.

And all I got was called petty.

""Yeah. I'm petty.""

I lifted my head and met his gaze.

""Grayson. Tell her to move out.""

""This is OUR home.""

Aria's fork clattered to the floor. She flinched and tears streamed down her face.

Grayson's expression darkened completely.

He didn't look at me. 

Instead, he walked over to Aria, shielding her behind him as if facing a vicious enemy.

""Evelyn Hart, are you done yet?""

I watched him shield another woman and laughed, but tears streamed down my face anyway.

""Grayson, who's really causing a scene here?""

""For three years I've lived like a ghost because of you.""

""I don't dare speak loudly. I don't dare sleep with the lights on. I'm terrified of disturbing your fragile nerves.""

""I made you my entire world, but what about you?""

""You screw other women, then come home and tell me it was for work!""

""How am I supposed to believe you?"" 

""How am I supposed to understand?""

My voice got louder until I was practically screaming.

Three years of hurt and humiliation finally exploded.

Aria trembled behind him, crying. 

""Evelyn, please don't blame Grayson, this is all my fault, if he hadn't saved me he wouldn't—""

""Shut up!""

Grayson suddenly growled, cutting her off.

His eyes were ice cold.

""Evelyn, you think I'm lying to you?""

I bit my lip and said nothing, but the distrust in my eyes said everything.

He suddenly laughed, bitter and exhausted.

""Fine. Since you don't believe me, I'll show you proof.""

He pulled out his phone, tapped the screen a few times, then tossed it in front of me.

On the screen was a hospital diagnosis report.

Severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder with accompanying sexual dysfunction.

Black and white. Clinical. Brutal.

Below it were video files of Dr. Sullivan's hypnotherapy sessions.

In the videos he looked like a helpless kid curled up on the couch, drenched in sweat, mumbling things I couldn't understand.

This was Grayson at his most broken—a side I'd never seen.

""See that?""

""The doctor said my trauma stems from that month of t0rture. I have an instinctive fear and resistance to all physical intimacy.""

""Aria's the exception.""

He paused, as if searching for the right words.

""The doctor thinks it's because she went through the same he11 I did. My subconscious sees her as safe, so my defenses drop.""

""It's a pathological response. Not betrayal.""

His explanation was airtight, almost scientifically sound.

So I wasn't his exception.

""So I'm the problem. Is that it?""

The words slipped out in a whisper.

Grayson looked caught off guard. He stepped toward me like he wanted to hold me, but I je//rked back.

His hand hung in the air, his expression unreadable.

""Evelyn, it's not like that.""

""I love you. I just want us to have a normal life.""

""Give me some time, okay? I'll fix this. I'll fix myself.""

His voice went soft, almost pleading.

I felt like I was losing my mind.

That night, Grayson didn't sleep alone for the first time in three years.

He lay beside me, his body rigid and tense—but our hearts were miles apart.

The next morning I woke up and Grayson was already gone.

I numbly threw some clothes into a suitcase.

I needed to leave—get some space, calm down.

I texted Grayson saying I'd stay at my mom's for a few days.

He didn't reply.

Dragging my suitcase downstairs, I saw Grayson's car parked not far from the gate.

He hadn't left.

Something twisted in my ch//est.

I pulled my suitcase toward the car step by step.

The window rolled down, but it wasn't Grayson's face staring back at me.

It was Captain Webb.

""Evelyn, where are you going?""

His expression was serious.

""I... I'm staying at my mom's for a few days.""

Captain Webb sighed and opened the passenger door.

""Get in. We need to talk.""

The car didn't head toward my parents' place. 

Instead, he drove in circles through the city's most congested streets.

""That kid Grayson—stubborn as he11, terrible temper.""

""I know you're hurting, but you also know what he's been through these past three years.""

""That month wasn't something a human being should endure."" 

""If it were me, I would've lost my mind.""

I'd heard this speech a thousand times.

""I know.""

""You don't just know. You've been incredible.""

Captain Webb glanced at me in the rearview mirror.

""Everyone at the station says Grayson must've saved a country in his past life to end up with a wife like you.""

""But Evelyn, sometimes being good isn't enough to fix things.""

My heart tightened.

""Captain... do you know something?""

Captain Webb went quiet for a long time—so long I thought he wouldn't answer.

He pulled over by the river and lit a cigar, taking a deep drag.

""About Aria. What Grayson told you wasn't the whole truth.""

On paper, earning 20-30 million VND per month in Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi sounds pretty decent. A few years ago, I would’ve thought that income level meant you’ve “made it” to a comfortable place. But now that I’m actually around this range, it feels different from what I expected. I’m single and renting, no kids, fairly simple lifestyle. Still, once rent and utilities are paid, a big portion of my salary is already gone. Food costs more than I realized, especially if I don’t cook every day. Transport, coffee runs, social outings, small trips, family support, and random unexpected expenses add up quickly. By the end of the month, I can save something, but it doesn’t feel like a strong cushion. It feels more like I’m one emergency away from stress. I wouldn’t say I’m struggling. I can pay my bills and still enjoy small comforts. But I also don’t feel financially relaxed. Upgrading my apartment, traveling more often, or seriously thinking about buying property feels far away. Sometimes I wonder if 20-30 million has just become the new “average” in big cities, or if lifestyle expectations have quietly increased. For those living in HCMC or Hanoi, does this income feel comfortable to you? Do you feel secure, or just stable?

I've been building Re:feel for the past few months and would love some early feedback.



\*\*The Core Idea:\*\*

Traditional journaling: ""Today I had coffee with Sarah, then worked on Project X.""

Re:feel: ""I felt warm and connected, then anxious about deadlines.""

It's about emotions, not events.



\*\*What Makes It Different:\*\*

Instead of journaling into a void, you can share your emotions anonymously and see others who felt the same way. 

The goal: realize we're all feeling more similar things than we think.



\*\*Current Features (Work in Progress):\*\*

\- Emotion-first journal entries

\- Sharing with the community (Anonymous option available)

\- Personalized emotion avatar that evolves

\- Emotion reports showing your patterns



\*\*Why I'm Building This:\*\*

I struggled with regular journaling: it felt performative, like writing a diary I'd never read. 

I realized I care more about HOW things felt than WHAT happened.

Talked to friends, turns out many people feel the same way.



\*\*Current Status:\*\*

\- Still in development (about 75% done)

\- Targeting launch in 4-6 weeks

\- Working on making the sharing feel safe and meaningful



\*\*What I Need Help With:\*\*

1. Does ""social journaling"" make sense, or is it confusing?

2. Would you feel comfortable sharing emotions anonymously?

3. What would make you journal daily vs. occasionally?

4. Any features you'd expect that I'm missing?



Really appreciate any thoughts! 🙏

The negatives: LSS, a friend (I'll call him K) thinks I'm TAH, and I disagree.

The positives: I noped out of hiking with K that day, and instead, had a girl's day out (hike and Lowe's trip) with a sweetheart of a pupper who is 100% ready for her forever home ❤️ If anyone is interested in adopting her, I'll sponsor her and take care of the adoption fees if you can't.

Other facts: K was recently friend-zoned for unrelated reasons... (Or are they? He has no commitments or responsibilites, by choice (work, family, social, religious, volunteer, etc). No job, no hobbies, no exercise routine, no religious/spiritual practice... Actually, his hobby is arguing. He does have a hobby. Dang it 😂)

Anyways, I gotta stop there. I was ""late"" and he's pissed. Focus.

Happy to clarify anything for anyone if necessary.



Text convo:
~~ 2/14/26 ~~

(K) Happy Valentines Day
Wanna go for a hike?
It's my turn to buy dinner

     (OP) Hey! I'm at the SPCA today, maybe tomorrow?

(K) It's supposed to rain here tomorrow
But why would that stop us?
Wanna do the same hike as last time?

     (OP) Looks like as long as we go early we'll be fine

(K) yes, earlier would be better
how early do you want to get up?
wannabe there at 9am?

     (OP) Yeah I think that'll work, I'm not doing anything else that early
              Hey idk how trail conditions will be so be prepared for the worst and/or it taking a lot longer than last time or possibly not being able to get all the way around it
              We were moving at a good pace last time in almost perfect conditions, seems like it was 3+ hrs
              Also if I'm up early enough I might take a pup with me for a shelter skip day
              Or if you want to try a shorter trail I'm open to that too

(K) Okay, maybe we shouldn't plan on walking around

        (OP) Yeah I'm cool with trying it but have a plan b like that
                I have gear for ice/mud, idk what you have

(K) just my hiking shoes that I won't forget this time
how old is the pup?
the worst part of the trail would probably be near the dam

        (OP) Oh idk I just take whoever hasn't been for a skip day recently
                Yeah I was thinking the same

(K) so maybe we could try it first

       (OP) Good idea
                 Like do it backwards?

(K) and if it looks bad we go the other way and back
yeah

        (OP) Sounds like a good plan

(K) so be at the same parking place as last time at 9
am

        (OP) That's what I'm planning on

(K) you have the place?
the link?

        (OP) I know how to get there
                It's a pretty straight shot for me, like two turns

(K) ok
I had to look up the link

         (OP) It's the one at the northeast end

(K) ummm... how am I supposed to buy you dinner if you bring a pupper?

         (OP) Didn't think about that, I'm good with takeout though

(K) can you bring 2 pups? so I can walk one?

         (OP) It'll probably be closer to lunch though

(K) dinner is an ambiguous term for me
it meant lunch in my family

         (OP) Idk, I can ask

(K) I don't have leashes or anything

         (OP) I have plenty of leashes but I think I'd have to have some way to keep them separated during the drive for safety
                  And I don't rn

(K) they don't have a travel cage

         (OP) I assume not, I could ask, I was just planning on putting one in the bench seat
                 If theyre really good I'd be okay with one being in the front seat but I've never asked about that
                 I'll let you know what they say in the am, they're closed rn

(k) okay


~~ 2/15/26 ~~
(K, 7:44AM) you up?
will you be there by 9?

         (OP, 8:03AM) Should be, I'm on the way to the SPCA now
                                 You up?

(K, 8:06 AM) Yeah, I just left

         (OP, 8:06AM) Cool
                                 eta?

(K, 8:09AM) 9:30?

         (OP, 8:09AM) A'ight I'll do some work there before I leave then

(K, 8:37AM) If you're not there at 9:30 I'll be unhappy

         (OP, 8:39AM) You're the one who's running late
                (9:04AM) Btw, eat something
                                You're already late may as well not arrive cranky
                (9:24AM) And it took me a while to get her in the car so I am about 10 min behind now

(K, 9:25AM) I'm here
5 minutes ahead
I had coffee
I usually intermittent fast until 11
I'm completely unsurprised you're late
If I could time my arrival with yours is do it
That's hard to do when I have to leave earlier than you

          (OP, 9:29AM) I'm completely unsurprised you're being an asshole
                                   I stalled for you bc you were late so fuck off
                                   And you didn't leave before me
                (9:34AM) Actually, screw it. You can hike by yourself

(K, 9:35 AM) Already am
Am I the asshole here?
(9:43AM) I think you read my texts uncharitably
                  (OP's reaction: 😂)

(K, 2:04PM) I'm not sure how to interpret a laughing reaction to a genuine comment, but I know what ""asshole"" and ""fuck off"" means. You might notice I didn't use those words even though I find it extremely disrespectful to waste someone else's time by being late. Once or twice is forgivable. Things happen.
But you don't have a good excuse and you didn't apologize. I had a good hike... thoroughly enjoyed it. too bad you couldn't make it.

          (OP, 3:19PM) Again, I wasn't the one that was late, so idk why you keep harping on that. We agreed on 9 and I adjusted to you disrespecting my time.

(K, 7:02PM) The difference that you're not seeing is that you made me sit and wait at the trailhead where I have nothing to do. I assume that when I give you an ETA, then it's not a problem to adjust the time you leave your place so you can arrive close to the same time. But you have a habit of being late. I think this was the third time in a row. and lets be real you weren't going to make it by 9 in the first place. That's why I waited until 9:30 so you could make it at the same time.

           (OP. 10:49PM) Let's be clear, we aren't compatible and I won't waste your time. Have a nice life.
                       And for the record, I hope I see *unedited* screenshots of this convo on a reddit AITA


(Other notes, this was an 8-9 mile trail in shitty conditions, and K was planning on doing it on an empty stomach, and wanted me to bring a second pup for him to be responsible for... In case he passed out and needed a pup to drag him back, I guess? Okay, yes, I'm exaggerating there, but still... WTF...)

I’ve been spending money on online girls for over a decade now. It used to just be the odd clip here or session there. It wasn’t until 5 years ago that I started earning more money that a problem started. Sessions every single night, multiple Dommes, live video chats, clip binges.

I’m not proud of it, but I’ve spent somewhere around $50k in the last 5 years on this addiction and hit rock bottom in November/December of last year where in total I spent $10k. What really stuck is that I could have used that to pay off my car or go on a trip or bought gifts for my family. It’s really weird when you have to rethink that $50 gift for a family member but will willingly send $200 to a girl online. That’s when I knew this really needed to stop.

I usually have one main domme going and then hop around to others either on onlyfans or Reddit to fill the gap when they’re not around. If I go a day without that I end up buying a clip on a clip store. 

My problem is I’ve associated masterbation with paying someone. I have a humiliation kink and the stupider the idea the hotter it becomes. And then I just keep getting stupider and stupider until a one night session could cost me $1000. Vanilla porn is almost impossible for me to get hard too now because there’s just no stakes to it. 

I can say as of writing this I haven’t sent any money in 12 days. It’s not much but it’s the longest streak I’ve had. I did almost relapse tonight so posting here to keep myself accountable. I find even a single clip or tiny tribute can send me spiraling again. 

One thing that’s worked for me this time around was completely staying sober. I’m not an alcoholic but I found even 1-2 drinks after work would get me loose enough to convince myself it’s a good idea to just buy one clip, or subscribe to one girl or buy one coffee.

My main problem with consistency is that I have a high libido and haven’t quit masterbation. So it’s trying to break that connection between porn and findom that is my biggest challenge, especially when the best porn in my fetish genre is usually paid for. 

Thanks for reading if you got this far, good luck to anyone on a similar journey. If you want to talk or send advice I’m open! If I had any question it would be, did anyone who successfully quit have to give up all porn and masterbation entirely or is it possible to separate the two again?

Like if I could throw out information quickly enough, people would assume I was sharp. Turns out, I had it completely backwards. And honestly, this realisation changed how I communicate entirely.

Most of us equate speed with competence. We watch TED talks where speakers fire off ideas rapid-fire, we admire friends who seem to have instant comebacks, and we assume the person talking fastest in a meeting must be the smartest one there. But research from UCLA and Princeton shows the opposite is true. When you speak slower, people perceive you as more authoritative, trustworthy, and yes, smarter.

The psychology behind this is fascinating. Fast talking triggers a subconscious alarm in listeners. Their brains interpret it as nervousness, uncertainty, or worse, like you're trying to bulldoze them before they can question what you're saying. Slow speech signals confidence. It says, ""I'm so sure of what I'm saying that I don't need to rush through it."" Dr Jonah Berger covers this extensively in his work on social influence; he's a marketing professor at Wharton, and his research on persuasion is genuinely eye-opening.

Here's what actually happens when you slow down. First, your ideas land harder. There's space between sentences for people to process what you just said. Second, you eliminate filler words naturally. When you're not racing to fill silence, you stop saying ""um"" and ""like"" every three seconds. Third, you project calm authority. Think about every respected leader or speaker you admire; they pause, they breathe, they let their words sit in the air.

The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks down exactly how this works neurologically. She's coached everyone from Stanford MBA students to Fortune 500 executives, and the book is packed with research on how small behavioural shifts create massive perception changes. The chapter on presence alone is worth the read. She explains how pausing mid-sentence (which feels terrifying at first) actually increases how engaged your audience becomes. This book genuinely rewired how I think about communication. It's not about performing confidence, it's about embodying it through specific, trainable behaviours.

But here's the catch: slowing down feels awful initially. Your brain screams that you're boring people, that awkward silence is happening, and that you need to fill every gap. You're not boring anyone. That discomfort you feel is just your nervous system adjusting. The silence that feels like ten seconds to you registers as a normal pause to everyone else.

I started practising this during low-stakes conversations. Coffee shop orders. Small talk with coworkers. Literally forcing myself to speak at half speed and pause between thoughts. Within two weeks, people started listening differently. They leaned in more. Asked better follow-up questions. Stopped interrupting me mid-sentence.

One resource that helped me loads was actually an app called Orai, it's a public speaking coach that analyses your speech patterns in real time. You can practice presentations or just talk about your day, and it tracks your pace, filler words, energy level, all of it. The feedback is insanely specific. It'll tell you, ""you're speaking at 180 words per minute, aim for 140 to 160 for maximum clarity.""

If you want to go deeperinton communication psychology but don't have the energy to read through dense books, there's an AI learning app called[ BeFreed ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450)that pulls from sources like The Charisma Myth, Pitch Anything, research on persuasion psychology, and expert talks to create personalised audio lessons. You can set a specific goal like ""improve my communication skills as someone who speaks too fast"", and it generates a structured learning plan with episodes you can customise from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are genuinely addictive, there's even a sarcastic style that makes complex psychology way easier to digest during commutes or workouts.

The vocal coach Andrea Wojnicki also has a YouTube channel where she breaks down the speech patterns of famous speakers, politicians, and CEOs. She points out how Obama pauses for three full seconds sometimes mid-speech, how that silence creates anticipation instead of awkwardness. Watching those breakdowns made me realise how much power exists in the gaps between words.

Another thing that helped was recording myself. Just voice memos on my phone, talking about random topics for two minutes. Then playing it back at 0.75x speed to hear what I actually sound like. It's uncomfortable as hell but incredibly useful. You notice patterns you'd never catch otherwise, how your pitch rises when you're uncertain, how you speed up when discussing topics you're less confident about.

What really shifted for me was understanding that persuasion isn't about information dumping. It's about giving people time to arrive at conclusions themselves. When you slow down, you create space for that process. You're not lecturing, you're guiding. The listener feels like they're discovering insights alongside you rather than being told what to think.

Pitch Anything by Oren Klaff dives deep into this concept. He's a venture capitalist who's raised hundreds of millions in funding, and the book dissects how neuroscience affects persuasion. His framework for controlling the pace of conversation to maintain frame control is borderline manipulative but extremely effective. The core idea is that whoever controls the tempo controls the interaction. When you speak slowly and deliberately, you're setting the rhythm everyone else follows.

This isn't about manipulating people. It's about making your actual ideas heard. Most of us have valuable things to say, but we bury them under anxious, rapid-fire delivery. Slowing down is just removing that barrier between your thoughts and how they're received.

Try this tomorrow. In your next conversation, deliberately pause for two full seconds before answering any question. Let the silence hang there. It'll feel excruciating. But watch how the other person responds. They'll wait. They'll listen harder when you do speak. That pause signals that what you're about to say matters.

Your ideas deserve to be heard properly. Speaking slower isn't about dumbing things down; it's about giving your intelligence room to breathe.",2,1771313755.0,TheIronCouncil,0,1.0,False

The breakup didn’t just take her. It took how i saw myself. I felt off. Like my whole identity was wrapped up in us and when it ended i didn’t know who i was without it. Everyone kept saying “just hit the gym bro” and yeah sure, lifting helped for an hour… but then i’d go home and still feel empty.

What really changed things was accepting i’m not going back to who i was before. That guy is gone. And honestly? That’s okay. I stopped trying to “restore” old me and started building someone new instead.

I went no contact even when it hurt like hell. I stopped drowning myself in distractions and actually sat with the feelings, even when it sucked. Some nights i just journaled absolute nonsense. Some days i forced myself to go out alone, grab coffee, take walks, be seen. It felt awkward at first but it slowly made me feel real again.

The biggest shift was realizing i kept looking for proof that i’m lovable from other people. When i stopped chasing that and started backing myself instead, my confidence came back in a quieter way. Not loud. Not arrogant. Just steady.

I’m still healing. Still got scars. But i trust myself more now. And that feels better than any “gym glow up” ever did.

1r6zqck,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1r6zqck/how_to_manifest_abundance_the_sciencebased_guide/,How to MANIFEST Abundance: The Science-Based Guide That Actually Works,"Manifestation gets a bad rap because people treat it like magic. They think if they sit around visualizing a Lamborghini hard enough, it'll materialize in their driveway. Spoiler: it won't. But here's what I've learned after diving deep into books, research, and countless podcasts on this topic, manifestation isn't about cosmic wish fulfillment. It's about rewiring your brain to notice opportunities and take action. The science backs this up. Your reticular activating system (RAS) is basically your brain's spam filter. When you focus on something intensely, your RAS flags related opportunities you'd normally miss. It's not woo woo, it's neuroscience.

The real issue? Most people manifest from a place of desperation and scarcity. They're trying to fill a void. That energy repels what you want because you're broadcasting ""I don't have this"" rather than ""I'm building toward this."" The mindset shift that changed everything for me was understanding that manifestation is 10% visualization and 90% becoming the person who already has what you want. It's about embodying abundance before you see physical proof.

**Start with gratitude as your foundation.** This isn't some fluffy advice. Dr. Robert Emmons, the world's leading gratitude researcher, has shown through decades of studies that people who practice gratitude literally rewire their brains for positivity. When you're genuinely grateful for what you already have, you shift from scarcity to abundance thinking. Your brain stops fixating on lack and starts recognizing possibility. I use the app Grateful every morning to jot down three specific things. Not generic stuff like ""my family"" but detailed moments like ""the way my coffee tasted perfect this morning"" or ""how my coworker went out of their way to help me yesterday."" The specificity trains your brain to hunt for good things throughout the day.

**Get crystal clear on what you actually want, not what you think you should want.** This distinction is massive. Society, Instagram, your parents, they all program desires into you that might not align with your authentic self. Sit down and write out your ideal life in excruciating detail. What does your day look like? How do you feel when you wake up? Who's around you? What work are you doing? Then ask yourself the hard question, do I want this because it's truly fulfilling, or because it looks impressive? The book The Surrender Experiment by Michael Singer absolutely destroyed my assumptions about goal setting. Singer basically threw out his life plan and committed to saying yes to whatever life presented. He went from meditation hermit to building a multimillion dollar software company he never intended to create. The book challenges this idea that you need to control every outcome. Sometimes the universe (or whatever you want to call it) has better plans than your rigid vision board. It's about being open to unexpected paths while still taking intentional action.

**Visualization only works when paired with massive action.** Dr. Gabriele Oettingen's research on mental contrasting shows that positive fantasies alone actually decrease your chances of success because your brain gets a dopamine hit from imagining success and mistakes it for actual achievement. Her WOOP method (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan) is way more effective. You visualize your goal, imagine the best outcome, identify the obstacles that will realistically appear, then plan exactly how you'll overcome them. This primes your brain for problem solving, not just daydreaming.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that pulls insights from psychology books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans. For topics like manifestation and mindset, it covers everything from neuroscience to practical frameworks. You type in what you want to learn, and it generates a structured plan just for you, pulling from high-quality sources that are fact-checked and science-based. The depth is customizable too. Start with a quick 10-minute overview, and if it resonates, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context. There's also a virtual coach you can chat with about your specific challenges, and it'll recommend the best materials based on what it learns about you. Honestly replaced a lot of my aimless scrolling time with something that actually moves the needle.

Use the app Mindvalley for their manifestation courses, particularly anything by Vishen Lakhiani. He breaks down manifestation into practical frameworks that strip away the mystical nonsense. The ""Consciousness Engineering"" approach treats your belief systems like software you can debug and update. It's manifestation for people who hate manifestation culture.

**Surround yourself with evidence that your goal is achievable.** This is where the RAS really kicks in. If you want to build a business, consume content from people who've done it. Listen to My First Million podcast where Shaan Puri and Sam Parr break down business models and interview entrepreneurs. Your brain needs proof that regular people achieve extraordinary things. When you're constantly exposed to these stories, your subconscious starts believing ""if they can do it, so can I"" and suddenly you notice business opportunities everywhere.

**Detach from the timeline and specific form.** This is where most people sabotage themselves. They manifest a relationship but it has to be with that one specific person. They want financial abundance but only through their current job. That rigidity blocks alternative paths. The energy of desperation, needing it to happen by a certain date in a certain way, creates resistance. There's a difference between having clear intentions and strangling the outcome. Set your goal, take aligned action, then release attachment to exactly how and when it unfolds.

The psychological principle here is called ""goal gradient effect"" mixed with reduced anxiety. When you're obsessed with the finish line, every setback feels catastrophic and you burn out. When you focus on the process and trust the timeline, you maintain consistency, which is what actually creates results. The Big Leap by Gay Hendricks explains why people self sabotage right before breakthrough moments. He calls it the ""upper limit problem."" Your subconscious has a thermostat for how much success, love, and happiness you believe you deserve. When you exceed that limit, you unconsciously create drama or obstacles to bring yourself back to familiar territory. Recognizing this pattern is insanely powerful. When things are going well and you suddenly feel the urge to start a fight or make a reckless decision, pause. Your upper limit is being tested. The book gives practical tools to expand your capacity for good things, which is what manifestation really requires.

**Embody the frequency of what you want.** I know that sounds abstract, so here's the practical translation. If you want financial abundance, stop talking about being broke. If you want a loving relationship, stop shit talking your ex to anyone who'll listen. Your words and thoughts create your reality not magically, but because they shape your behavior and energy. People are attracted to or repelled by the vibe you give off. If you're constantly in victim mode, complaining about circumstances, you'll attract other victims or people who want to exploit that energy. When you carry yourself like someone who's already abundant (generous, confident, grateful), you naturally attract opportunities and people aligned with that frequency.

This isn't about fake it till you make it. It's about genuine internal shifts. Ask yourself throughout the day, ""What would the version of me who already has this goal do right now?"" Then do that thing. It compounds.",1,1771313650.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

Since some of you seem motivated, I'll chime in too. For a year now, every day has felt like Saturday, only without the Monday blues and the feeling of having to go to work.

We (44) have about €1.8 million invested in global ETFs and money market funds (75/25).

We're insured through an international health insurance company (€450 for both of us) We're staying well below our budget, even though we live on a sailboat and I often spend my days searching for spare parts and fixing things :)

Things have become much easier for us. I've stopped smoking, and we don't drink anymore (not that we were addicted before or anything), we just don't ""need"" it anymore to distract ourselves from the daily grind. We go to the gym, take lots of walks, and love to cook. My wife reads, and I play games on Steam Deck.

I'd say we're doing better than ever, and hardly a day goes by that we don't realize it. We never experience boredom, and even if we did, how often have I been successfully bored at work? Now I can get up and do whatever I want, like take a power nap :)

I think every year is precious; with each passing year, opportunities also diminish because one gets older. We also meet people who do a little bit of work online. They say things like, ""Oh, just a little bit, a few emails, etc., I still earn a bit of money for that. I could retire, but—I couldn't imagine it, easy money, etc."" But they still say, ""I have to do this and that.""

For those who can't imagine to Fire, retirement must be a terrible event. Even though practically everyone talks about what they want to do when they retire. They assume they'll even live that long and that until then, and beyond, everything will stay the same.

We're relying solely on the capital market, which seems much more reliable to me.  
Well, now I'm going to get a little philosophical... back to topic.

What I want to say, FIRE is a completely different ballgame. You want to get things done, and that's a huge difference!

Whether the money will be enough, I have no idea. Whether I'll need more money someday, maybe. What did I know about my future self 10 or 20 years ago? Was I even interested in that?

Worries are like rice; we usually overdo it.

I am going to have a coffee now, stay on track!

I didn't take over the management immediately because I didn't feel ready. I started as an intern for two months to understand how things worked internally.

During this time, I was deeply disappointed by the women in this work environment. Over those two months, I only felt like I was actually working seriously a few days, mainly on Saturdays when the other employees weren't there.

My role mainly consisted of making coffee, buying meals, or picking up orders. This isn't shocking in itself; it's part of the learning process in some organizations.

What struck me most was the lack of discipline I observed among some of the female staff. Repeated delays, lengthy discussions upon arrival despite the delays, low productivity on 7-hour days (sometimes only 4 hours actually worked), and disregard for IT security rules and internal procedures.

I don't yet have control over human resources and I'll have to wait several years before I can officially take action.

In discussions with some people, I've realized that for some of them, work isn't a priority because they can financially rely on their spouses.

* Around QC (can't host, okay with planning dates first)
* 5'11
* Hygienic, mabango, respectful
* Gym beginner but consistent
* Into late night talks, food trips, coffee, random walks, movies/series
* Conversational and affectionate once comfortable
* and trying to get my life (and katawan) together.  I’ve been trying to work out consistently the past months and slowly making it a habit.

**What I’m looking for:**

* Female, preferably 22–29 (not strict)
* Someone okay with **exclusive casual setup** (not seeing multiple partners at the same time)
* Chill, communicative, and kind
* Values consent, boundaries, and discretion
* Open to hanging out/actual connection, not purely transactional vibes

* I prefer meeting first in public (coffee/food) to see if we vibe

I’m (22f) looking for a cozy game that I can play for years or for a very long time. A PC game where I can play like an hour or more a day where I can progress, explore, do tasks or challenges, etc. My current hyper fixation is Good Coffee, Great Coffee. I love that I can memorize recipes, make drinks, decorate a small space, and do challenges/tasks. Another game that I also love is Dave the Diver, I love the exploration aspect and having 2 different game plays where theres diving during the day and running a sushi restaurant at night, I also like that there are tasks that give me direction in the game. I used to love Genshin Impact because of the exploration and farming materials for characters. 

I don’t really like farming games. I’ve tried Palia, Wylde Flowers, Heartopia, and Stardew Valley and I always give up within hours. I think they stress me out too much and the “decorating” aspect is way too much for me (thinking that I’m not as creative as others). I also do not like pixelated games and top-down povs. 

I like games that make me feel whole or some type of special way. I want to get attached to the characters. I want to fall in love with a game and wont get tired of it after a couple days. So please do recommend me some cozy games, mainly looking for a PC game but if it’s on mobile that’s okay too! I will appreciate anything <33 ",8,1771312201.0,gamerecommendations,12,0.84,False

1r6z8yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1r6z8yd/the_teddy_bear/,The Teddy Bear,"This nightmare began haunting me six months ago.

It all started with a dream. I saw a plush teddy bear—an ordinary toy, brown and worn, with dull glass bead eyes. But something about it was off. Perhaps it was the faded fur, smoothed as if by countless hands, or a barely perceptible sense of wrongness in its motionless pose.

The bear sat in an old vintage armchair, its fabric faded and dusty, tucked into the corner of a dim, half-dark room. I stepped closer, and at that exact moment, the toy slowly turned its head.

“I played with Andriy! It was so much fun!”—the bear said.

The voice was bright, cartoonish, like something from an old children’s cassette, gratingly unnatural. It came straight from the soft body of the toy, though it had no speaker, no mechanism of any kind.

I wasn’t afraid—just coldly puzzled. Who was Andriy? I didn’t know anyone by that name. I opened my mouth to ask, but the space was torn apart by the blare of my alarm clock.

I woke up. My room felt alien: the walls too close, the air heavy and dusty. The armchair still sat in the corner—empty—but I hesitated to look at it for a long moment.

The day dragged on in dull routine. The dream nearly faded from memory, until that evening, when a message appeared in my alumni group chat:

“Andriy passed away.”

The usually dead chat erupted. Messages poured in: questions, condolences, fragments of memories. Only half an hour later did I realize who they meant. Andriy… We had been in the same class, but barely interacted—different circles, different lives. I wouldn’t have recognized him on the street. They wrote that he had been driving at night when suddenly he felt unwell. His car lunged forward and crashed into another vehicle.

I remembered the dream. Coincidence? “Andriy” is a common name—too common to give it meaning. I tried to calm myself, dismissing the thoughts about the bear, and returned to my tasks.

Two months passed.

The dream returned. The same dusty room, the same heavy air, the same chair in the corner. The bear waited for me, motionless, as if time had frozen around it. My heart raced, hands trembling, but curiosity overpowered fear. I stepped forward. The floorboards creaked, the sound echoing through the silence.

The toy twitched. Its glassy eyes glimmered with a cold, otherworldly light.

“I played with Larysa. It was so much fun!”—the bear sang, in that same sickly sweet voice.

A shrill, childlike laughter—alien, many-voiced—filled the room, bouncing off the walls, as if even the dust motes in the air were singing.

I woke with ringing in my ears.

At the office, seeing Larysa’s office door closed, anxiety tightened in my chest. Larysa, my colleague, was always punctual. Every morning she greeted me with a smile, and the scent of coffee in a paper cup drifted from her office. Today her door was locked.

I stood there, tugging the handle—uselessly. I told myself she might have overslept or been stuck in traffic. We are all human. I didn’t want to cause panic. I sent her a message, then returned to my desk, but my gaze kept drifting back to her door.

By lunchtime, she still hadn’t appeared. My messages went unread, my calls unanswered. The unease became unbearable. I finally went to my boss, explaining she hadn’t come in. He frowned, tried calling her himself, then found her mother’s contacts.

Two hours later, the news hit us like a blow. Larysa’s mother, worried by our call, went to her apartment. She found her daughter lifeless in the hallway. Paramedics declared that Larysa had died early that morning of a heart attack.

The dream resurfaced like a poisonous fog. I had felt indifferent about Andriy’s death—he was a stranger. But Larysa… her death struck as though a piece of me had been ripped away. I tried convincing myself it was coincidence. Had I subconsciously sensed something wrong? Had my mind woven her image into this nightmare?

But deep down, I knew: the bear would return. And I dreaded discovering whom it would play with next.

A month ago, the nightmare returned.

The same dusty room, the same heavy air, the old chair in the corner. The cursed bear sat motionless, its glassy eyes dimly gleaming in the half-light. I froze, feeling the cold crawl under my skin. The toy slowly turned its head.

“I played with Karina. It was so much fun!”—it sang, in that cloying, cartoonish voice.

Karina. My ex-girlfriend. We had broken up long ago but stayed on good terms, and honestly, my feelings for her had never faded. Hearing her name, I dropped to my knees. Tears streamed uncontrollably, and I sobbed, begging the bear to spare her.

I woke in a cold sweat, shaking, and grabbed my phone. I called Karina repeatedly—no answer. My heart pounded, thoughts crashing like waves. I began calling mutual friends. I learned that she had gone on vacation to Turkey with a friend.

I couldn’t reach her friend immediately. Finally, a sleepy, irritated voice answered. I shouted, I cried, trying to explain that Karina was in danger. She didn’t understand at first but threw on a robe and went to her hotel room. I could hear her knocking on the door, calling Karina. Silence. No sound, no reply.

The friend summoned a hotel staff member. After long pleading, he opened the door. The creak of the curtains was followed by a piercing scream from the friend—a sound that etched itself into my memory forever. My phone slipped from my hands. I collapsed to the floor, sobbing.

Eventually, the friend, barely recovering from shock, told me: Karina was on the floor by the bed, eyes wide open, face frozen in terror. The doctors said her heart couldn’t take it.

The next day, I quit my job. Days blurred into an endless search for answers. I scoured the internet, delved into psychology, psychiatry, dreams, the supernatural. Forums, sites, books—anything that might hint at the nature of these dreams. In vain. I spent almost all my savings on psychics and fortune-tellers, but they, too, had no answers.

The scariest part is the unknown. What is this? A prophecy? A curse? A warning? And why me?

Last night, the bear returned. Its toy head turned to me, glass eyes glinting. The childish voice, full of sinister delight, sang:

“Soon we will play together! It will be so much fun…”",1,1771311914.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

When I saw him again at school, my heart sank immediately. He is still this perfect as always. His eyes are amber, the prettiest gem I have ever seen. When he was running around on the basketball field, the sweat running down his face shined below the sun. Then he looked at me, smiled back and waved. My heart beat lost control. Of course it would, as always. But it was so nice to see him again! I really miss him. Even though we are still friends. Just seeing him was enough for me. After his game he came and talked to me, his lips were as pretty as the roses. It sounds so wrong lol, but I couldn’t think about anything else but kiss him. I think I am being too delusional. But what if… what if he also secretly likes me. Ughhhhhh I don’t like this feeling, I don’t like how I am so dependent on him. But I like him so much.



2025.9.15, Sunny

Today he got yelled at by Mr. Smith. But he did nothing wrong!!! He just forgot to finish his homework. It’s not that big of a deal. HOW COULD THE FRICKING MR. SMITH YELL AT HIM. This was making me so mad. He ran out of the classroom in the middle of the class. My poor Elijah… He shouldn’t have been treated like this. I ran to the place he usually hides when he doesn’t feel good. He definitely was surprised to see me there. I sat beside him. I saw his tears dripping down his face. I petted him. He frowned at first, but soon he allowed me. I gave him a cup of coffee — The one he usually drinks. I think he was touched. He moved a little closer to me and started talking. I said he is a very nice person, and Mr. Smith was just being mean. We talked for half an hour-ish, then he stopped crying — which made me a little sad. His tears were so beautiful. If I could I would kiss all his tears off. After that he asked me how I knew he was here. I smiled and told him it’s a secret. Of course it’s a secret. I HATE Mr. Smith. No one can ever yell at Elijah. *Not a single creature in this world.* 



2025.10.31, cloudy. 

HE ASKED ME OUT FOR A COFFEE!!!!!!! The reason he used it was to thank me for missing class to comfort him last time. Of course I would. I would do everything for him. Not even mentioning just missing half an hour of class. I can miss days for him if he needed me to. When I told my friends that he did this they were all saying that he definitely has feelings for me. I hope it’s true. And of course I did. We were walking our way to Starbucks. He was talking half of the time. I was listening and smiling at him. He is way much taller than me, when he lowered his head to talk to me I could see his face blushing again. What a cutie. On our way back he suddenly said, “Mr. Smith was just doing something he needed to do. It was my fault that I didn’t do my homework.” I suddenly didn’t want to smile anymore. How can he even say that? I told him, “No one can ever yell at you. They don’t have rights to.” Maybe it was because I got too serious, I realized he probably got a little scared. So I changed the subject. I was holding an icy drink. So my hands were so cold. I wanted to hold his hand so badly so I told him my hands are cold. And I grabbed his hand and said, “yours is warm.” Surprisingly, he didn’t push me away, so I held him tighter. He was blushing again. So beautiful that I wanted to print a kiss on his cheeks. 



2025.11.12, sunny

Today he had his basketball game. And a STUPID boy from the other team hit him. Then he curled up on the floor and couldn’t even move. My body suddenly got cold. I couldn’t control my breathing for a couple of seconds. The teachers moved him to the bench in the hallway that no one was in, then they were gone. I ran to him as fast as I could to check if he was doing fine. His face was as pale as snow. He was surprised again to see me there. I sat beside him again. My tears couldn’t control themselves the moment I saw him there. I slowly took his hand, and he allowed me to. I saw the bruises on his knees and legs. The anger in my chest was burning me so harshly that I couldn’t feel anything else. HOW THE FRICK CAN SOMEONE HURT HIM??? I wondered why the world still allowed him to breathe. I could tell he wasn’t expecting me to cry over his bruises. He laughed softly, like it was nothing, and took his other hand to wipe my tears softly. He told me it doesn’t hurt as much as I thought. The more he smiled, the less I could forgive the boy who touched him. He tilted his head, amused, “Why are you more angry than I am?” I looked up, didn’t even manage to control the way I might look in his eyes, “Can’t you tell I like you?” I guess he was surprised that it would be this straight forward. I leaned towards him, looking at his rosy lips that I have been wanting to kiss for such a long time. He didn't back down. They tasted as good as I expected. His lips were warm, as warm as something fresh made. I want more, I didn’t know what “more” meant. When we split he leaned back to me, kissed me again, his eyes were full with me, “I’ve wanted to do that too.” It felt so good — It was as if some unspeakable desires had been soothed.



2025.11.16, cloudy

Our first date\~. We went to Starbucks again. I opened my arms and ran to him the moment I saw him. And reached the lips I have always been wanting. He lowered his head to look for me so we could kiss. I like when he does that. Lowering his head for me, only for me. It was not enough. One light kiss was not enough. He didn’t kiss me for a long time because we were still on the street with strangers looking at us. I have to say I was kind of unhappy about that. I didn’t want to scare him, so I let him go. But he took my hand tightly and put it into his pocket. His smile was just as warm as the sun — I could see love in them. I have always wanted that. *He is mine now. Only mine.* 



2025.12.16, rain

The kisses stopped being enough. I have been thinking about him even in class. It has never happened before. Hunger had been running in my veins. I started wondering if this was how love could taste. My hunger wasn’t just for closeness—it was a craving, a gnawing urge I had never felt before. I wanted to mark him, to consume him with my attention and desire, as if my love could only be proved by feeding on him. Stupid Mr. Smith interrupted me by asking me some stupid questions. Even though I don’t listen in class I can still answer all his stupid questions about molecular mechanisms. It was amusing seeing him getting red at me because I didn’t listen in class, but couldn’t get any reason to punish me because I knew everything. After the bell rang I just took my backpack and went to find him as fast as I could. I wanted to bite, bite his lips, his cheek, his neck. He smiled when he saw me coming towards him. I dragged him into an empty room. My hands trembled with hunger, not just for him near me, but to taste the essence of him. Every breath, every touch of his skin, left me craving more. I could not stop myself—the hunger was bigger than reason, bigger than fear. Elijah seemed a little scared by what I was doing. He tried to push me, “Hey… Baby, it hurts…” But I couldn’t help myself. I couldn’t think about anything this morning but him. I didn’t let him go even though I tasted blood. Then a strong force pushed me away. I was being pushed to the ground. My arms got against the ground, several bloody welts immediately appeared on my arm. I allowed myself to fall onto the ground, while enjoying the pain running through my body. The little iron taste of his blood calmed me down. He seemed surprised about what he had done too. He ran to me, held me, and checked my arms. Even though I made him bleed he still didn’t blame me for anything. He was so nice, too nice. Too nice for the conflicts. His eyes flickered between concern and something softer, something only for me. I told him I was fine, said sorry, and softly bit his neck.



2026.1.4, sunny

I started collecting his things, his hair, his pencils, his t-shirts. I need them to put me asleep… otherwise I would have a sleepless night no matter how hard I try. I like the smell of his neck, it is just as sweet as the bakery section of the grocery store. Today he frowned and told me that there was one blue t-shirt that he couldn’t find no matter what. I frowned and said, “I’m sorry to hear.” I didn’t tell him, actually, *I took three*. But the way he was trying to find his top was so cute — like a cupcake sweet vanilla icing on the top. 



2026.1.12, rain

I don’t know where this desire was coming from, but the more he appears in my eyes, the more my teeth long for him. Today, he was talking to another girl in our grade. That girl looked at him as if she had the right. She could have asked someone else, but why did she just ask him? How could he even talk to other girls? Is having me not enough for him? I felt the anger in my chest again, it burned like fire. But I couldn’t show anything. After that girl was gone I dragged him with me. Hunger went over me. My arms went around his waist, laid my head on his neck and pressed my teeth against him, a warning disguised as affection. He seemed hurt, wanted to push me away. I didn’t let him. “What’s WRONG with you??” his voice shouted out his anger. Even though I didn’t want to, I still let it go, and changed to soft licking. “Why did you talk to that girl? Didn’t you see that she likes you?” He seemed surprised, frowned, “she was just asking some group project questions. I can’t even talk to any females now, ugh? And why do you always want to bite me like a fricking dog?” I could tell he got mad at me. So I stopped the subject. Held him tighter, I knew he always liked it when I did that. The room became quiet, so quiet so we could hear each other breath. I didn’t answer him. *Not enough, it was NOT enough…* I was still longing for something more. I could feel my heart racing, my hands trembling, but I couldn’t stop. Why were we still two independent people? He should be mine. He pulled my chin up for me to meet his eyes. I ignored the little uncomfortable, afraid, and anger in his eyes, and leaned closer. He hesitated, eyes darkening with something I couldn’t read, then slowly… he let me. “That boy who hit me… he broke his leg a few days ago,” he said, voice calmer, almost testing me. I put on the harmless smile I usually do, lost in the warmth of him, ignoring the flicker of discomfort in his eyes. *That boy deserves it.* 



2026.1.30, cloudy

Weeks passed. His skin began to bruise in places no one could see. But he started ghosting me. Not answering my text, not waving back at me when we see each other in the hallways. I hate this feeling. How dare he do this to me. Didn’t he know how much I have done for him?? He couldn’t do this. I need him. I couldn’t focus at school. My friends asked me what’s wrong. I couldn’t say anything. Elijah can’t do this to me. *He does NOT have rights to. He has no right to escape from me.* The hunger is burning me insane. The thought of him made my mouth ache. I just can’t let him leave. *I need him to be a part of me.* 



2026.2.2, ??

Today he told me he wanted to break up with me. He wanted to be by himself, but ignoring all the things I have done for him. I should have thought that. I should have known that boys like him aren’t satisfied with the things they have. He was such an idiot that didn’t appreciate my love!!! But it’s okay. I forgive him. I told him I don’t want to break up, he seemed not sure about this as well. Of course I am not gonna let him go. Everything is going to be okay. Elijah, you will be mine soon. My stomach felt a little more satisfied just by thinking about the plan. 



2026.2.9, ???

He blocked me on all the contacts we have — it made me so mad. He wants to leave me alone now? How can I let this happen to me? I know I need him, just as much as always. I stopped him on his way to the next class. Pulled him again into the empty room, went for his lips. I wasn’t kissing him. I was taking him. The taste of blood filled my desire — it was a devouring instinct by wild animal instincts. He tried to push me away, but I didn't let him. I could feel his body remembering me, just as it should. Then I let his lips go. Our foreheads were still touching. Our breaths went so close it became one. And this realization satisfied me. He turned his face away from me, “Listen, this is not how a relationship should work. I don’t think we fit each other.” My eyes darkened, allowing tears to fill my eyes, pretending to be a sad girl who just broke up with her boyfriend. My voice got softer, even with some trembles at the end, “...sure, if you really want to,” I leaned closer, “but we haven’t spent a single valentine together yet. For my last wish, can you come to my house so we can talk this through? After that, if you still want to break up, I won’t stop you.” He hesitated for a very long time, so long that I thought he would say no. Then he sighed, like the prey’s last try before it got eaten. He mistook my hunger for love, the way gentle people always do.



2026.2.13, ???

Today, the stupid Mr. Smith asked me why I was so energetic. His eyes were scanning up and down at me full of questions, with a look I really hated. He also asked me what’s wrong with me and Elijah. I smiled and  told him we are fine. He looked at me like he finally understood what hunger meant. What’s wrong? Nothing is wrong. We are more than fine. Tomorrow. After tomorrow he will finally be mine. I can’t wait anymore, every second before this feels like years. Just imagining having him entirely makes me tremble, my stomach is yelling with joy just by thinking about it. I have been preparing since September just for this moment. Don’t worry Elijah, it’s not gonna hurt. Not at all. How can I let you feel the pain? I love you so much. 



2026.2.14, Quiet.

I sanitized the scratches on my arm, I didn’t waste a single part of him. There was finally silence in my hunger. At last, I finally claimed him. Now there was no part of him I didn’t know, no part of him that could escape me. He belonged to me — body, mind, and taste alike. My bones scream with satisfaction. ***Happy Valentine's day, Elijah. Now you’ll never leave.*** I will go to school tomorrow, just like always.",1,1771311612.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

The prices are so low that you can get two different frappés and two more drinks for about the same price as one cup at a well-known coffee shop with similar or even better coffee. You really get more for your money!

No kidding!

Amazingly, in just one year since it opened, BRWD. Coffee and Tea has grown to 50 branches. Since it is a family business, the smartest move was to expand through franchising.

And that is what they did, as Miss Alex Alfonso, the owner of BRWD. Coffee and Tea, Lilac, confidently manages this branch. She is a second-generation owner and franchise holder in this family business.

With coffee drinks that attract younger customers, BRWD. Coffee and Tea has become a favorite spot for young professionals and students in this area of Lilac. Their frappés look so good that you will want to try them as soon as you see them.

I am travelling to Melbourne for a holiday from WA at the end of next week. This is my first time to Melbourne.

Specifically, 27th Feb (fri), evening departure 4th March (wed)

What I didn't realise is the F1 Grand Prix is on in Melbourne the following weekend, with the first practice races starting the day after I leave.

I am aware I will not be in the city on the race weekend, but I am just curious, how busy will the city be while I am there? Will it be busier than usual? Just so I am prepared, mentally and physically.

And should I also prepare in other ways? i.e pre-booking V-Line tickets, leave early to be ready for packed trams, etc.

I am staying pretty central in the CBD. I mostly plan on sightseeing. Trying out the food/coffee, and travelling. 

I am just making sure I haven't made a mistake booking as I know these big events draw a large crowd.

My hotel / flights were reasonable ($130aud per night for a single room for 5 nights in an Ibis Styles Hotel, and $660 round trip w/ Jetstar with Seat selection and 15kg baggage)

1r6z1at,https://v.redd.it/ars7f4v350kg1,LA Stormy day: $0. Coffee: $5. Waymo Customer Support: Priceless. --- My rainy day rescue,"I’ve shared my Waymo rides here before, and from the start, I’ve been a huge advocate for robotaxis. Whether it’s the surface streets of LA or the freeways, I’ve never once felt unsafe or scared. In fact, I’ve become so used to the empty driver’s seat that I usually just sit back and enjoy the peace and quiet. Well, today was a different kind of adventure. Los Angeles got hit with a massive amount of rain, but I didn’t hesitate to book a ride since I’d promised to meet a friend visiting from out of town.

My Waymo arrived in under six minutes. Since it was a holiday, the streets were mostly empty, and the traffic was light. Normally, my route to downtown involves the freeway to save 10–15 minutes, but the car opted for surface streets instead likely due to the storm that intensified right as my trip began. There were deep puddles everywhere.

As I got closer to my drop-off, the car seemed to ""freak out"" and came to a dead stop in a major intersection. I’ll be honest: while I didn’t panic, it was a bit unnerving to feel that powerless while other drivers started honking at us. You’re truly in the hands of an invisible driver in those moments.

If you watch the video, you can see the car just stop right in about a foot of water.This was a true test of Waymo’s ability, not just the technology, but the human support behind it, to handle a tricky situation.

Customer support was fantastic!! They stayed on the line to ensure I was safe and managed to get the car moving again so I could reach my final destination. It was a gloomy day, but the excellent service really brightened it up.

(Note: I don’t work for Waymo! I just believe that when any company provides A+ service, it’s worth sharing. Nothing is perfect, but I truly feel Waymo is on the right track as they expand around the world.)

My next challenge is to one day take a long trip from LA to San Diego or San Francisco all in a Waymo. I'm looking forward to that trip!",11,1771311169.0,waymo,1,0.87,False

1r6z0ph,https://i.redd.it/d4jkzqgz40kg1.jpeg,"Why Locals Love La Vernice Cafe in Parang, Marikina, for Its Handcrafted Donuts and Comfort Food","It might surprise you to learn that [La Vernice Café](https://www.facebook.com/lavernicemarikina) originally comes from Tarlac. Yes, the farthest branch from the main one is the Parang branch, neatly located at P. Lopez St., along Gen. B. G. Molina St., Marikina, 1809, Metro Manila. It’s just across the side of the Parang Barangay hall and at the back of Dada’s *Panciteria*.

The name comes from the owner’s daughter, Vernice, so it makes sense that the owners are a family who loves food and works hard to serve tasty, carefully made dishes and drinks at fair prices.

The [Marikina branch](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=122128603910975419&set=pcb.122127349466975419) keeps the name’s tradition by serving donuts, fresh coffee, and comfort food, all made with the same care and love. This branch is a franchise, run by young business owners full of energy and new ideas.

  
La Vernice is known for its handmade donuts and special coffee drinks. The menu also has baked breads, frappes, sandwiches, and *silog* meals. Every dish and drink is made fresh and blends classic and modern comfort-food flavors.

The cafe serves coffee, handmade donuts, pastries, filling meals, and special drinks. This branch also added something extra. The photo booth is like the classic 70s [Photo Me](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DoYouRememberThe70sFanClub/posts/4720151924920086/), but now it uses a touchscreen and has more photo effects. The controls are as easy to use as a cellphone app.

This modern photo booth can also be rented for weddings or other events. It costs 200 for photo strips, and rental starts at 18,000 for unlimited photos for 3 hours, with customization options.

I’d put it on almost every morning before heading to the library or meeting classmates for group study sessions.

It wasn’t about anything glamorous, just the everyday grind of student life that somehow feels vivid when I catch a whiff of it now. Years later, smelling it still brings me right back to those stressful but productive days, the small victories, and the ordinary rhythm of college life.

My whole life I have been surrounded around strong minded, wise, and mature adults. I caught onto their humor and such so when I entered high school I felt very outcasted. I made one friend but I cut her off as she was not a good influence. I realized that it was not cool of me to abruptly cut her off but at the time I thought that was right. I wanted to have a friend who was on the same growth mindset and academic level as me.

Anyways, Highschool was hell I spent the rest of my time eating int he bathroom (super gross I know) or behind the school practicing introspection by journaling. Throughout that introspection I was able to learn a lot about myself and I wrote 4 killer essays that got me into a prestigious school.

I held no expectations going into college. My first semester I joined every club that interested me. Like EVERY interest. I had a light schedule so I attended all the meetings and I met a good handful of people When I find people I click with I can be loud and vise versa. The people I connected with were never freshman but upperclassman. I narrowed it down to a few clubs I really love and I routinely go to but I have yet to click with anyone.

I thought I finally had a friend when I met this one girl last semester. She was also an only child and we had fun at events. However recently things fell off and it looks like she's trying to connect with other people as she only has a year or so left. A person in my class last semester reached out to me. I was hesitant as they were already a part of a friend group so she was not desperate for friend like me. We had a brief hangout and it was fun but they never reached out again and I did run into after and it was pretty awkward? I'm ok with people feeling me out and not wanting to hang again I guess it's just disappointing.

My dorm is known out of all of the dorms to be a bit socially dead. I am also on an all girls floor and I would say nobody is close unless you lucked out with a good roommate. My roommate situation is a whole other story but a reason I feel bad especially today is both of the roommates I've lived with have always brought friends into their dorm and I guess I always get annoyed in the moment but I think I feel so negatively because I wish I could bring someone in to talk to.  I do enjoy my solitude and in college when everyone has busy schedules having no friends is not the worst thing but I really wish I had a friend. The closest I came to having a friend was my grandfather and we both liked jazz, to read, and learn about history.

Recently I invited one girl I seen around on my floor to get boba and that was nice but again she seems busy and she never asked to hangout again. In class I ran into someone I recognized in my dorm and started a conversation with them. We swapped socials but it never went through. (apologies for the millions of examples i'm just trying to show a girl is trying). Off track but I'm not always so harsh on myself because my generation is pretty screwed. I will be standing waiting for class and everybody is on their phones. No one is willing to talk to strangers or get to know anyone spontaneously.

Anyways  recently I ran into someone else familiar and asked if they wanted to grab a coffee and they said yes. So I am trying AGAIN. I just don't understand when I'm in the dining hall and walking on campus everyone has their group and I don't get how they all make friends with each other like that. I would find it draining to have someone stuck to my hip and I am sort of picky of how my friend should be (someone with no friends ik). I keep hearing everyone say it's the best years of our lives and i'm having a blast by myself I take myself places to study and shop but I guess I have had fomo for 4+ years.

1r6yvwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1r6yvwl/bare_minimum_streamers_shouldnt_stream_at_all/,Bare Minimum Streamers Shouldn't Stream at All,"Streamers are like athletes in the sense that we are an audience that watches them play. We dogged on other streamers, like XQC or even Ninja, for tryharding before, but I always believed that the should be *tryhards* even if they're playing amongst friends (which are often other streamers).

Many times, you'll see it happen. Someone in the chat says something along the lines of ""you're not even trying"" and the streamer will say something like ""I'm playing with friends, we're just having fun""

No. This is your job. Be good at it. We understand a learning curve. We get making mistakes. But to always go trololololo just because you've chosen to play a game for the nth time because it's the only thing that's consistently gotten you views, but you're clearly so tired of it. *Oh but I can play however I want if you don't like it just watch something else...* Then why not just stop playing that specific game instead of not even trying? You'd be mad at your barista if they were giggling and taking their time to make your cup of coffee (the hundredth one that day) because they were just tired of it and they decided to talk to their friends. 

Think NBA. Steph can play flashy, have fun on the court. Ok. At the end of the day, he always plays to win. He puts up numbers. He is literally playing with his 'friends', too. If an NBA player simply lets opposing players run past him and not try on defense, he get called out - and they should be called out.

I am watching streamers to play a game, that is above everything else. I am not watching you to have lols with your friends. At the root of it. We all watch streamers to play. If they don't win, it also sucks for us rooting for the streamer. Imagine if they lost because they're trying too hard to just put jokes out there and try to be funny. Imagine if they go on a tangent about a single white hair on his mustache for far too long, trying to be funny. Be funny... and TRY! You know what, just get off the game and maybe try comedy if that's your schtick. 

Streamers are also like athletes in a sense that they shouldn't be drunk or high when they're playing with other people who don't partake. I understand that there are drunk or high streams - and those are cool since they title them as such and let you, the viewer, know beforehand. You can ignore them. 

But I don't want to watch a streamer and hear the person they invited play on a lobby and hear them take a hit, slur their words, or flat out say ""I don't care I'm high"". Literally just play with your friends offline then. Paul George playing with mental health meds got suspended for 25 games. That streamer should just get off the lobby. That should have been a bare minimum.

And you know the other people in the lobby are talking over the person taking an audible bong rip (not even muting their side) so that they don't violate some guideline or policy or some shit. They are actively aware it is not good for the general audience. Then stop inviting those people!

And what is up with horny af streamers? Like all they say is some semblance of love for their homies but there are just too many cock and penis jokes and innuendos. One time may have been funny, twice may have been a callback, even the third I can forgive... But ALL. THE. DAMN. TIME?

*If I don't like it, just watch something else... You're being toxic... blah blah blah.* Okay, Ben Simmons. Where are you now? 

At the end of the day, we want to watch streamers play and try. They can provide the commentary, it's fine. Just... try. You mean to say you can't spare 4, maybe 5, hours a day on your not-even-best behavior? You're potentially getting millions from your audience. Don't we deserve effort?

1r6yvos,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r6yvos,This is healing 🌸,"Context: Ako yung tipo ng officemate na since magkakateam tayo, pag may nagyaya na lumabas para bumili ng food, madalas sumasama ako, minsan hindi.

1r6yvij,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1r6yvij/how_to_eat_and_live_as_a_poor/,How to eat and live as a poor.,"wassup. I'm poor just like you all.

Went from 6 fig salary to neg 40k networth at 22. (corporate layoffs that i never truly recovered from)

Nearly halfway out of the hole on a household income (married) of only 4k after tax near Atlanta.

The number 1 thing that we cut was food costs, and it seems to be the one thing people just can't seem to understand so I figured I'd post a pretty simple guide of how to eat and live for cheap.

1. Price per Meal

This may sound harsh, but if you're poor, you should literally never spend more than 5$ per meal to feed yourself. McDonald's isn't a right. You can make breakfast sandwiches (egg, cheese, bread, mayo) for less than a dollar, you can cook a crock pot of chili for less than 20$ that should feed you for nearly a week, you can make a pot of spaghetti for less than 10$ that should feed your for nearly a week, you can make bologna sandwiches for less than a dollar, beanies and weenies, baked potato soup, etc. Energy drinks are stupid, a thermos of coffee will last all day and cost pennies. Water comes from the tap for like 1 cent a bottle. Sweet tea powder is like 5$ to make 10 gallons.

If you are spending more than 5$ per meal, you are messing up somewhere. And I promise your kids won't care unless you've spoiled them horribly. If they are older, they should be able to comprehend the need for their parents to save money.

2. Generic brands and sales.

Super obvious, but if you don't make enough for a yearly vacation, you don't make enough for Kelloggs or Kraft. Buy generic products whenever you can, or if a sale is really good, take advantage of it.

3. Convience is the devil

Again, if you don't have the money for a nice yearly vacation, you can't afford literally anything inside of a gas station except for gas for the car (exception for cigarettes, but even then watch how much you spend, buy cheap cigs if you have to smoke, they are all pretty damn similar speaking from experience)

4. Rent

If you are spending more than 25% of your income on rent, move.

this one can suck, but being poor sucks worse. Suck it up for a few years and move to a shithole. It is what it is. My wife and I went from a luxury apartment to a literal 500 sqft moldy shack in the ghetto for 1k for a couple years. wasn't fun, but it allowed me to pay off more debt in less time while working as an Amazon delivery person.

5. Activities

Every time you leave the house is a minimum of 100$.

Stop. Buy a switch off of marketplace and a couple games and don't leave the house unless it's for errands or work. We live in an age where YouTube is free, games are fairly cheap for the amount of time that can be sunk into them for pleasure time, and you can do bodyweight workouts with a professional through a screen for free.

If you are bored, it's kind of your own fault.

6. Subscriptions

Are we even serious? No.

No Amazon Prime, no Spotify, no YouTube Premium, no Netflix, no hello fresh. Its point blank stupid.

7. Budget DAILY

You should literally know where EVERY dollar goes.

check your banking app every. single. day. 

nothing should surprise you.

8. Debt

focus on smallest balance first or largest APY (personally smallest balance works better, standard snowball method. if you have too many and feel overwhelmed, stop paying any except the ONE you are focused on first/next. Fuck your credit score, most of you/us aren't buying a home anytime soon and you can get a beater car off of marketplace for like 3-5k if yours ends up with serious issues.)

At the end of the day if you're poor

a: Its nothing to be ashamed of. shit mf happens.

b: Only you can fix it. So live like you're even poorer than you are and save/pay down debt/adapt.

In the great depression people ate roadkill. I'm certain you can handle chili/speghetti 3x a week and drinking coffee instead of pricy snacks and drinks.

not a perfect person obviously. but when I started this debt/poverty journey it seemed impossible to the point I attempted suicide and had to be locked up. (living wayyyyyyyyyy beyond our means) it takes years of dedication. but its either sacrifice NOW or sacrifice later.

I genuinely like being authentic with the eyeshadow, eye liner and my favorite pair of pants that are very affirming. You know? I got that grunge girl vibes going on. But anyway here we go...

I spent 1.4 years at a company in an IT related role. During that time I socially transitioned further while working there. The job itself was a sedentary ten hour grind that could literally put you to sleep. My gender queer coworker whom is like my best friend would pass out while staring at the screen waiting for jump scare or anything to stay awake. But that was not even the exhausting part.

Workplace culture was really toxic. I experienced repeated misgendering, hostile commentary, and inappropriate discussions about my body. It was like they wanted to know what was under my bra and in my pants! Why are these wierdos so obessed?Then the political rhetoric constantly bled into the workplace, turning what should have been a professional environment into something adversarial.

 It honestly felt like I was the first trans woman they had ever met in the wild.  Instead of acting professional, several grown men became insecure toddlers. Correcting them was like talking to a brick wall. At least the brick wall has better comprehension.

I reported these issues. HR’s handling lacked clarity, consistency, and transparency. Despite raising concerns multiple times, nothing meaningfully improved. I was dismissed repeatedly, sometimes literally in tears, because it was becoming unsafe to continue working there.

Eventually I started playing Red Rover with their logic.

Red Rover, Red Rover, send basic critical thinking right over.

They would say I could not use my pronouns or my name. I would respond along the lines of, “Clayton v. Bostock, bitch.” Mic drop.

On top of that, I was pressured to use the wrong restroom against my gender identity. Somehow I was also roped in with the men whenever the restroom looked like a disaster. For the record, I sit to relieve myself. Thank you very much. I am not the reason the restroom looks like a biohazard zone from something the movie Alien popped out of.

Reported harassment.

Watch management reach into the Ass Hat of Consequences and pull out performance issues. Corporate magic is wild. Totally not retaliation! That could'nt be possibly it? Bet you it is!

I left the meeting speaking Japanese under my breath like an anime antagonist. Bakayaro desu. Corporate villain arc activated. The irony is I am the only translator for that division. Good luck with that.

I wrapped up my last task, walked over to my genderqueer coworker who I absolutely adore, left my number and said, “Call me. Coffee soon. We can talk about real men in uniforms.” He lost it laughing.

Then I looked at the lead and said directly, “I quit.” He became a deer in headlights. He thought I was joking. I was not.

I explained why. A cis woman nearby asked what happened. I told her. She instantly became pissed. Turns out I’m not the only one tired of the nonsense.

Oh and by the way, the company is about to get sued by a bunch of cis women for the similiar garbage. Imagine that! Wow mind blown! Kapow!

So fluff yeah. Let’s go! I quit, freedom byatches! I walked out with Pride energy like a final boss yelling, ‘I love being a trans woman!’”",0,1771310544.0,MtF,0,0.5,False

I made one friend but I cut her off as she was not a good influence. I realized that it was not cool of me to abruptly cut her off but at the time I thought that was right. I wanted to have a friend who was on the same growth mindset and academic level as me.

Anyways, Highschool was hell I spent the rest of my time eating int he bathroom (super gross I know) or behind the school practicing introspection by journaling. Throughout that introspection I was able to learn a lot about myself and I wrote 4 killer essays that got me into a prestigious school.

I held no expectations going into college. My first semester I joined every club that interested me. Like EVERY interest. I had a light schedule so I attended all the meetings and I met a good handful of people When I find people I click with I can be loud and vise versa. The people I connected with were never freshman but upperclassman. I narrowed it down to a few clubs I really love and I routinely go to but I have yet to click with anyone.

I thought I finally had a friend when I met this one girl last semester. She was also an only child and we had fun at events. However recently things fell off and it looks like she's trying to connect with other people as she only has a year or so left. A person in my class last semester reached out to me. I was hesitant as they were already a part of a friend group so she was not desperate for friend like me. We had a brief hangout and it was fun but they never reached out again and I did run into after and it was pretty awkward? I'm ok with people feeling me out and not wanting to hang again I guess it's just disappointing.

My dorm is known out of all of the dorms to be a bit socially dead. I am also on an all girls floor and I would say nobody is close unless you lucked out with a good roommate. My roommate situation is a whole other story but a reason I feel bad especially today is both of the roommates I've lived with have always brought friends into their dorm and I guess I always get annoyed in the moment but I think I feel so negatively because I wish I could bring someone in to talk to.  I do enjoy my solitude and in college when everyone has busy schedules having no friends is not the worst thing but I really wish I had a friend. The closest I came to having a friend was my grandfather and we both liked jazz, to read, and learn about history.

Recently I invited one girl I seen around on my floor to get boba and that was nice but again she seems busy and she never asked to hangout again. In class I ran into someone I recognized in my dorm and started a conversation with them. We swapped socials but it never went through. (apologies for the millions of examples i'm just trying to show a girl is trying). Off track but I'm not always so harsh on myself because my generation is pretty screwed. I will be standing waiting for class and everybody is on their phones. No one is willing to talk to strangers or get to know anyone spontaneously.

Anyways  recently I ran into someone else familiar and asked if they wanted to grab a coffee and they said yes. So I am trying AGAIN. I just don't understand when I'm in the dining hall and walking on campus everyone has their group and I don't get how they all make friends with each other like that. I would find it draining to have someone stuck to my hip and I am sort of picky of how my friend should be (someone with no friends ik). I keep hearing everyone say it's the best years of our lives and i'm having a blast by myself I take myself places to study and shop but I guess I have had fomo for 4+ years.

TLTR: I have tried to reach out to people. I have yet to make a best friend. What should I do?",1,1771310318.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
