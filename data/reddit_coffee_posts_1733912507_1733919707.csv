1hbs635,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hbs635/aitah_for_not_being_happy_about_the_birthday/,AITAH for not being happy about the birthday present my husband was planning,"My husband and I have a problem with birthdays. I took him out to a fancy restaurant for his and got him a gift the first year we were together. He did nothing for my birthday. It bothered me but I figured he wasn’t that into celebrating birthdays and hadn’t asked or expected me to do anything for his so maybe I made too much fuss over him.  Anyway after that I never bothered with his birthday but I was still always upset when he did nothing or next to nothing for mine. A couple of times he bought me flowers or chocolates but that’s it.

So this year, after a few very strained years of our marriage, I decided to try and revive birthdays. Partly to show him that I care and partly as a test to see if he cared enough to reciprocate for me. So I got a babysitter, booked a restaurant and picked him up from work and we had dinner together. I even used a gift voucher for the restaurant that I had won because I didn’t want to upset him by spending too much on the evening, especially since he didn’t expect anything and money is a little tight. We had a nice evening. 

When my birthday rolled around he wished me happy birthday and gave me a kiss as he left for work in the morning. In the evening it was clear he had no gift for me. It was impossible that there were plans because that would require a babysitter which I would have had to organise. But anyway I served dinner and afterwards asked him not to disappear down to his manage because we would be having cake in a few minutes. He disappeared anyway and when I was ready to bring out the cake I sent a kid down to tell him we were doing cake. He didn’t arrive so we went ahead, the kids sang happy birthday to me and we ate cake. Later he came up and had some himself. I was upset and let him know when we went to bed.
I kept hoping he would do something for me on the weekend but no. I kept my distance for a few weeks and didn’t have sex with him. I was upfront that was still upset about my birthday and waiting for him to make it up to me. He said a few times that he didn’t realise we were having cake but that is bs because I literally told him right before he disappeared. 

Finally after a couple of weeks I could tell he was getting impatient for sex and typically makes more of an effort to be patient and nice when he wants sex. I know it’s kind of manipulative and of him but I like to reward that good behaviour but I still was hurt about my birthday and indignant that he had made no effort to make it up to me. So I brought it up again at bedtime and he said well actually I was on the lookout for a better espresso machine for you. I have one in mind I just have to track it down etc. or something along those lines. And this is where I might be the a-hole… I bought an espresso machine not long ago. Second hand and it does the job and I like the way it looks in my kitchen. He didn’t really drink coffee before but has become kind of hyper fixated on it lately trying to learn how to optimise the machine and clean it and watching YouTube videos on how to make perfect coffee and researching the best accessories etc. So when he said he was looking for a better machine for my birthday I simultaneously thought “oh that’s nice” but also “my machine is fine, I picked it to suit the aesthetic, he wants a better machine for himself this is nothing to do with my desires or my birthday and he’s just saying this because he wants sex right now “.  Well he must have read my less than enthusiastic reaction because he added ..I didn’t say anything about it because you’d probably say I was getting it for me not you. To which I honestly replied well actually yeah I was thinking that. But then I felt bad for complaining when he evidently was at least thinking of getting me something. On one hand it seems obvious that I’m NTA but also I can’t help but feel he has no clue what to buy me and is anxious of getting the wrong thing so he just avoids it. I can be like that with gift giving too so I get it. But also he could have literally got me flowers and that would have shown he at least cared and then there’s the whole cake incident. So AITA? 

TLDR: husband did nothing for my birthday, I kept bringing it up, eventually he said he was looking for a particular coffee machine for me but I wasn’t impressed because I felt it was more for him than me. Now I feel like TA for not being grateful. However weeks have passed and no new coffee machine has materialised. Maybe because I gently poo pooed the idea or maybe because he just said it to get me to have sex with him?? ",1,1733919399.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False
1hbs5gs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hbs5gs,Beauty and the Beast,"Mancera as a brand is quite hit-or-miss, they’ve delivered some real gems but also a few underwhelming releases. That said, their recent launches have been consistently bangers.


Cedrat Boise Intense (CBI) was the second niche fragrance I purchased after Arabian Oud Sultani. At first, I regretted buying it as it was a blind buy and didn’t immediately click with me. However, after wearing it multiple times, it grew on me, and now I’m on my second bottle.


CBI is inspired by Creed Aventus but with its own unique twist. It’s about 50-60% similar initially, but then it takes a different path. The opening features black currant with a bright, lemony vibe for the first 20 minutes. After that, woody notes start to emerge, accompanied by a touch of synthetic oud. While it can smell a bit synthetic up close, it’s absolutely magical in the air. On skin, it lasts around 6 hours (my previous bottle lasted around 8 hours, so this seems to be reformulated). The performance can be increased if sprayed on clothes. Overall ratings - 7.5/10 (previously 8.5/10).


Now onto Amore Caffe, one of the best gourmand scents on the market right now, second only to Noir Extreme. I can’t wear it much in Bangalore weather that much though. It’s a linear fragrance, opening with sweet coffee and vanilla and staying that way until it fades, it lasts for around 8 hours. If you love coffee and want to smell like a Caramel Frappuccino, this is the scent for you! It’s perfectly unisex and highly recommended. Overall rating -  9/10.",0,1733919337.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,1,0.5,False

1hbs4yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hbs4yg/i_think_i_might_deserve_better_but_i_still_love/,"I think I might 'deserve better', but I still love him? 21F 22M","Hi all,

I've been dating my boyfriend for 2.5 years now. We are in college, and met here. Our relationship has always been very stable and he is very good with communication. We both come from broken families and made the effort to do better in our relationship than our parents did. We don't ever fight and if we have problems we're good with talking them out. For the most part, I guess, as we haven't figured this issue out.

I (21F) come from a religious family. I myself am not overtly religious but it is ultimately part of my core values and very important to me that my family and their wishes are respected. My boyfriend is atheist and while this is obviously not my ideal, he is more or less respectful when it comes to things involving religion. Actually, this has been the one thing that has come up multiple times through our conversations as something I'd like for him to work on as sometimes he makes disrespectful jokes or makes fun of religious people, things I don't like. Regardless its okay since he doesn't have any real disdain for religious people and its not a source of conflict in our relationship. However, last march, I finally met my boyfriend's family. It was clear immediately that my religion would be a problem, and during dinner, I was grilled with questions about theology and about my faith. First of all, like I said, I am not overtly religious so I couldn't even answer them, and I just felt so judged and scrutinized. I felt like my boyfriend's dad almost wanted to make me question my faith or make me lose it by proving that I was a bad christian. That's how it felt like to me. Whether or not this is true is unknown, but I did mention to my boyfriend that that's how I felt and he just kind of said, ""sorry, that's just how he is"".

Which immediately leads me to my next part. His dad is SO intense. Their relationship confuses me as someone who is deeply close to my family, as theirs is almost purely transactional. My boyfriend and his dad are more like business partners than father and son. They speak MAYBE once a month MAYBE and its just to check if my boyfriend needs anymore money. His dad didn't bother to remember my name until more than 1 year into the relationship, which really bothered me because it made me feel so insignificant. Versus, my mom wanted to know everything about my boyfriend the moment we started dating. My boyfriend says his dad was ""busy"" and didn't have time to know such trivial things, like the girl his son was dating... for context I am the first serious relationship he's ever had and the first person he's ever brought to meet his family. I don't know, I just don't see how you could not care about your own child like that. I'm concerned for our families to meet because I fear that it will cause a nuclear explosion to go off. My family of all women are highly non confrontational and non-argumentative whereas my boyfriend and his dad spend hours debating for fun. ... serious debates, by the way. not silly cute little parent-child debates. I'm concerned that his dad will be even worse to my family than he was to me, and I don't want that for them. We have recovered from MY dad and my mom still has intense anxiety issues from his verbal abuse and the last thing we need in our lives is someone who is going to make us feel like he did.

However, his dad is so absent that part of me feels like it won't be a huge issue. But that is another thing. I have always dreamt of a joint family, and it makes me sad that I won't have that here. We've talked about how our families inevitably won't get along, and my boyfriend is fine with just keeping them apart as much as possible and keeping ourselves in a bubble away from them. This is fine with him because they aren't close, but family is so important to me, and I don't want to keep mine distanced. They also love my boyfriend and have completely accepted him into their lives, so yeah.

We are leaving college soon and I plan to return home to go to grad school. My mom is disabled and while she is independent to an extent, she needs help with finances and paperwork and I am bound to her and have made this very clear to my boyfriend. Of course I can leave home, but I will not leave her to move out of state and that is non-negotiable. I've always dreamt of having a nice, comfortable and peaceful home in the suburbs where I grew up. But my boyfriend hates suburbia and says it bores him. He's understanding of the fact that I can't really move out of state, and so he had planned to live in NY and work for a bit after graduation before eventually starting grad school himself.  I was totally content with this plan because even though we'd be apart, it would only be a 45 minute commute which is totally feasible for weekends if we're both occupied full time. but his dad convinced him to move somewhere else. Probably Boston after graduation. Their family is rich, and he said his dad wants him to make the most of the opportunities available to him. Its like, we had settled on something, and then my boyfriend's dad visited over thanksgiving, and the plan took a 180º turn without me in it. he **ALWAYS** heeds his dad's advice. its like they forgot to consider the fact that traveling to/from boston and spending quality time with your s/o in one weekend is nearly imposssible. I don't want to have it for the rest of my life where my boyfriend's closest confidant blatantly excludes my contribution in his life.

Now for the part about this post. I love him very, very deeply. But I'm concerned about the rest of my life. I want these things with my family and to settle down and be happy. But he never gets me gifts. He doesn't do surprise flowers, or even flowers for that matter. For christmas and birthdays, I get bags of sour patch kids or swedish fish, just random candy from the grocery store. We don't go out on dates, and if we get food, we always split the bill. I tried to be understanding of the fact that he doesn't have a job, but I just found out that HE paid for his dad's stay over thanksgiving break and the cost for hotels and food was over $2000, and he told me he booked a ski trip for himself and a friend over winter break. I don't know, it just hurts I guess. Why wouldn't you want to treat your girlfriend every once in a while?

I love gifting (it is one of my love languages) and I always pick up random things for him as I go along. Maybe a candy bar or a pair of fun socks that I thought he might like or just small and silly things like that. I'm not asking for a rolex or prada purse for my birthday, but I just want to be shown that he put care into picking out a gift for me. I've customized lego figurines of us for valentine's day, hand painted him an espresso cup and platter (he is a total coffee nerd and mentioned he wanted to start collecting them), and spent hours picking out tons of thoughtful gifts that I put thought and care into. I thought maybe I would try getting a less thoughful gift to spend less and put the same amount of effort in that he puts into mine, but it hurts me to be like that since I genuinely love gifting. So what's the right answer? I don't even think he would notice if I stopped putting in the effort with his gifts.

We had our 2 year anniversary in September and I knew he wouldn't do anything for it since he didn't do anything for our first. I wanted to celebrate so I got us tickets for my favorite band in the city. I thought maybe we would go out afterwards or something, but we got chick-fil-a in penn station on the way back to campus. We ordered seperately, and I paid for my own food. He did get me flowers though, which I was grateful for, and in the same sentence he told me that he got a new beer at the store to try, which was like 22 dollars or something. This is relevant because the flowers he got were a 8 dollar bouquet from the grocery store that he picked up while going to get beer. He spent more on beer than he did for our anniversary. And again its really not about the money, its about the fact that these things are so not a priority in any way to him that he would rather get any old flowers than find nice ones for me when he knows I love them. And apparently he did have money this whole time so I don't know why he never gets them for me. His lifestyle is budgeted monthly by his dad since he doesn't work so he gets money for groceries and take out and stuff, and its more than enough to support one person financially. I never understood why he couldn't put aside 5 dollars or something every month to get me something, or even ask his dad for an extra $50 for us. They are quite literally drowning in cash. I can't emphasize enough that this isn't about money-- but I would spend every last penny I had trying to make him happy and he doesn't bother spending a dollar on me. He just is not thoughtful at all, and I am so thoughtful and intentional in everything I do.

We've been dating for 2.5 years and he always says he'll do things but never follows through. I love going to the aquarium (i'm a big marine animal lover), and from before we ever started dating, he's been saying he would take me one day. We've never gone. Last year, I went alone on my birthday because I was tired of waiting and I just wanted to go to the aquarium and I knew he wouldn't plan anything. And I was right, he didn't end up doing anything for my birthday. It was my 21st, by the way. I basically begged him to get me flowers for national girlfriend's day in august while we were long distance, just to have something from him, and he did not. He said he would make it up to me sometime but never did, and I'm sure he never will. There are other things he's said he'll make up, too, that he never has. He never plans anything for us. 2 valentine's days have come and gone where he hasn't done anything. The first year I planned for us to have a nice quiet day and bought us chocolate, strawberries, and cookies to bake together. He watched south park the whole time while I baked. Last year I planned a whole night for us in NYC, and I even made sure to keep costs low by checking literally tens of restaurants and finding a special on entry into some museum. He didn't like the selection of the art at the museum and complained about the restaurant's food. Okay yes it wasn't the best but i spent HOURS combing reddit, tripadvisor, yelp, google reviews, etc to find something in budget and romantic. I called to make reservations, I figured out the subways to take, I bought our train tickets. I got our museum tickets. I did everything. I *always* do everything.  He didn't lift a finger planning the entire date. I'd wished he would, and asked him for help, but he didn't. I just want someone who will appreciate the effort I put into these things, and someone who will make the same effort for me.

I tell him everything about everything because that is just the type of person that I am. But he is very stoic, i guess is the right word, and very introspective. It took me a year to pry him open to get him to tell me about his day. Even still, if I don't ask, then he won't tell. Not that he is being secretive, its just his nature. And it makes me sad because the reason I'm like this is because growing up I always had someone who wanted to hear about every aspect of the day, and he didn't and isn't used to reporting to anyone since his parents were so absent. I just want someone who tells me everything in the same way that I do, but how can I even hold this one against him? We've talked about it but its very evident that it doesn't come naturally to him. Still, it makes me kind of sad when something comes up days later that he did that I would have loved to hear about, that I didn't. I love him, ya know? so I want to delight in all the things he gets up to but I never hear about them.

But I don't want it misconstrued. He is a very loving, patient, and caring man. That's what leaves me so torn. He makes me feel safe and understood and listens to what I have to say. He respects me and cares for me and has made huge changes to himself just for me, most times without me needing to ask. He is so good emotionally and he has no temper, which matters so much to me as someone who grew up with an abusive parent. I really love him but I'm unsure if I want to spend the rest of my life feeling like this. He hasn't done anything wrong, but I just don't know. I hate to say that I ""deserve better"" because I think that he is the most wonderful person, and we get along so well and love each other so so so much, but I don't know. I don't want to think about myself with someone other than him. Its hard to say I want someone who is more like me because I want him to be these things. But I'm afraid that this is just the way he is. I've brought up the gift thing before and that he doesn't plan much but he doesn't see a problem and says that his dad believes that gifts were only for ""big things"" and if I want to plan things than I should. He isn't selfish or uncaring, we just don't see eye to eye. I have a lot of worries about our future but losing someone who loves me and who I love kills me to think about. When I tell him I'm concerned about our future he tells me we will figure out our issues together but I know a life together would be a constant uphill battle. I'm not sure if I want to spend the rest of my life fighting to make things work. He always puts the effort in emotionally, but that's all. Is that enough? Maybe I'm just not valuing what I have. Are my expectations too high to want someone who loves in the same way that I do?

He's been through a lot in his life and he has his own issues. He doesn't really have anyone who truly cares about him besides me, and he wants to marry me. I don't want to leave him and it breaks my heart to think that he would be completely alone without me. I'm not ready to give up yet but I'm so tired of giving my all to get nothing in return. I don't know if I want to spend the rest of my life feeling like this. I'm not sure what advice anyone can give me but maybe someone out there has been in a similar situation. I'm sure you can love someone to pieces and just have them not be right for you.",1,1733919288.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

* I was just recalling an episode of DS9 where a Romulan diplomat complains about delays to Warbird repairs and Chef O'Brien has to account for it and explain. So, the Chief and his staff are ALSO responsible for repairs of war-damaged ships. Meaning not only does the Chief have the maintenance of a finicky Cardassian-Federation-Bajorn-Frankenstein station, the Defiant, several runabouts, but during wartime: he gets the run a major repair station on the front lines. Imagine if the Romulans didn't get that hospital on the Bajoran moon and Bashir got all the emergency wounded. We'd never see him again on the show.
* On another note, it would have been amusing/great to have a night-shift Chief on DS9 played by someone like William H.

Hi everybody, I want to share about my constipation problems that started in 2020 and ended in 2022 after two years of suffering.  
It all started with a little blood in the toilet after my morning bowel movement ritual.  
I've went to the doctor a few days later to check what is happening and it seemed that I had a fissure and hemorrhoid problems, followed by hemorrhoidal crisis and a lot of pain due to it.

All of this was caused by all the little constipations, that I had earlier.  
The doctor prescribed me with different creams for rectal usage and to make washes with potassium permanganate. These helped just a little bit, but my problems continued because my root constipation problem wasn't solved anyway.

In the next two years I've visited multiple doctors/proctologists, drank all kinds of pills, used all kings of creams and nothing helped. And finally one day after not going to the toilet for 5 days I was finally hospitalized. With pain in the stomach and after drinking multiple laxatives, I became a shit bomb with timer. Although it sounds funny now, it wasn't.

Thanks to the emergency doctor who accepted me that night, and the sanitarian that managed to clean my stomach from all the stuff using enema, I saved myself from a emergent surgery /a few more hours and it could have been needed/.  
For the next one/two months I was mostly fine probably because of the stomach cleaning, but not long after it my problems came back.

6 months later my mom remembered about a homeopath that helped me when I was child having problems with some rashes on my skin.  
I've decided to give it a try since I hadn't anything else to lose. My condition was really bad at that time, I was on different diets, ate only specific breads, foods, etc and have lost almost 20kgs of weight. A dying zombie man.

So I went there, described my whole situation, answered all the questions and started medication with the prescribed homeopathic pills.  
In the next few weeks I've gotten worse /which is normal with homeopathy/ and after a week more a miracle happened.  
I've started going to the toilet regularly everyday, every morning, but the only problem was that some white stuff showed on my tongue.

After doing a laboratory examination it showed that I have E.Coli in my stomach and over-growth of candida both in my stomach and my tongue, which were doing all of this harm to me. /homepathics bring the inner problems outside on a visible place/.  
Probably it was all because of a weak body and immune system due to stress or something else, I cannot know for sure.  
I've started some antibiotics and other medicines for a while, but was not feeling very well from them and stopped in the middle.  
Two years later I have no problems with the constipation. /knocking on wood/.

A little offstory of what happened after that:

A while after fixing my constipation problem I had a case of high BP / high heart rate and did end up in hospital due to drinking a lot of coffees and having a stressful job.  
From time to time my constipation was coming up as a result of the stress, but the doctor who saved me from my pre-infarct condition said to me: ""The only cure for stress is SPORT"".

So, for the last two years I exercise on the street fitness/calisthenics every day /sometimes saturday and sunday as well/, have restored my normal weight \~86kgs, have gained power and muscles, almost have beaten stress and have no constipation issues what so over.

A bit later I've started doing some yoga and breathing techniques and my yoga teacher says: ""For permanent results, permanent actions are needed"".  
If you want to feel good everyday, you have to do something about it everyday.

So my friends,

If you want to get cured, please try another way and don't only go on the road of western medicine.  
Perhaps it helped someone, but it was not me.  
Try homeopathics, herbs, exercices, etc.  
Diets are almost never of your help. Because diet is a temporary thing, and the result of something temporary is also temporary.

It is not that important what you eat, but more important what you put in your heads that stresses you and what you do to convert all your food into proper energy.  
When your body is healthy it converts the food into whatever it is needed for it, even if you eat shit. /still it is better for your to pick a better food when possible/

Ps: I will not mention about pills/homeopathics names because what helped me, can injure you.  
You should ask your local homeopaths/doctors.

And a Big Thanks to my mom, my homeopath and the emergency doctors during these two hell years.

Good luck to you all, I hope my story helps you somehow and you get better sooner, because I know it is a pure hell.",2,1733919213.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

I am fortunate to work in healthcare 🦷 which gives me a lot of autonomy and flexibility with work hours. I work 2-3 days a week, I’d say I average 5 days a fortnight 8-9 hours a day.

This brings in a total income of around 250k, from this I need to pay super, educational expenses and insurance. 

I’ve had a few people find it odd that given I’m young and able I’m not chasing the grind more. Including my boss who is supportive, but a bit of a workaholic. He is in 60’s still cranking out 5 days a week, but he’s loaded I guess. He has alluded to making “mid 7 figures” and he lives a lavish life but I am not sure if he is happy. My boss is also the owner (I am a contractor)

I just don’t see the point in working more though. I enjoy work sure, it keeps me sharp and it’s social but there are a million things on any given day I’d rather be doing. When I only have 2 days booked in for the week I honestly feel so happy and relaxed. I have no alarm, I slowly get out of bed, go for a run and swim and enjoy a coffee in the sun before reading a book. My expenses are low (40k a year) and I don’t desire expensive things. I find my time and being left to my thoughts to read and wonder more valuable than any watch, car or fancy home.

[The Department of Energy’s loan office is more popular than ever | Latitude Media](https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/the-department-of-energys-loan-office-is-more-popular-than-ever)

[Image credit: Lisa Martine Jenkins \(Photo credit: Department of Energy\)](https://preview.redd.it/tpc5h67ni76e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cfabe68c5b16cf7bca520c551cfeb7bf46684f5)

As of this week, the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office has finalized 14 loans since director Jigar Shah’s tenure began in 2021. Four of those closings took place in the month before the election, and four in the month since. 

Another 19 loans are in the conditional commitment stage, meaning DOE has signaled its intent to finance a project, but that the requirements for cash to be doled out haven’t yet been met. Five of those were announced in the last month.

Those deals — both finalized and announced — add up to just under $55 billion in project investments. 

And the number of deals and dollars going out the door isn’t going unnoticed. Last week, Republicans on the Hill sent Shah a [cease and desist letter](https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/12_04_2024_Letter_to_DOE_LPO_a32b1c36aa.pdf), accusing the office of “scambling to close deals” and citing its ramp up in projects post-election. 

“On election day, the American people rejected the Biden-Harris administration’s rush-to-green agenda,” the letter, authored by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, said. “We insist that the Biden-Harris administration cease its campaign to quickly distribute federal funding before the incoming administration takes office.”

But the letter mischaracterizes what’s going on. It’s certainly true that loans are being signed and finalized at a quicker pace than in prior quarters or years. As the letter noted, the office has closed four loans in less than a month — after finalizing ten total earlier in the administration. And LPO staff are working around the clock to get them out, to the tune of 75-hour weeks.

However, the pressure and urgency is flooding *into* the office, not emanating from it. As conversations at Deploy last week made clear, the rush is not that of the outgoing Biden administration, but from the private sector.

Hundreds of companies already in the office’s application pipeline, the majority of whom applied long before the election, turned up at the Walter E. Washington convention center last week for the second annual conference focused on investment in clean energy tech. The event recorded a 200% attendance jump over last year. Even the registration line alone, which stretched for more than an hour and a half on day one, suggested that these companies are eager to be a part of this LPO’s final, ferocious months — and aren't sure that the support that the office has offered will be around come January.

# Private sector pressure

Despite the GOP lawmakers’ alarm, the clock didn’t start for LPO on election day. 

The office has in fact been ramping up  since this summer, working to finalize as much as possible before January, even in the case of a Harris change-over. That’s in part because even a new Harris administration would inevitably result in some lost momentum in the office as key players use the transition as an opportunity to pursue work elsewhere in the administration, or beyond.

The private sector is nudging the process faster as well. Just a few months ago, it often took six months or longer for LPO to get signed documents back from applicants, many of whom weren’t fully prepared for the office’s rigorous vetting process, and who often wanted to negotiate terms of the offered loans. 

(LPO loan terms, though not publicly disclosed, are set by Treasury and are not negotiable. They are, however, significantly more favorable than other types of financing, several recipients confirmed to *Latitude Media.*)

Now though, companies and their non-LPO investors are eager to finalize deals before the inevitable slowdown — if not rollback — that a new administration backed by a GOP-majority in Congress will bring. In the weeks since the election, companies in LPO’s pipeline have been turning around their paperwork in record time, without attempting to negotiate terms. Some are even following up to ask just how quickly things can be finalized.

The pace of LPO’s financing process is “ultimately up to the borrowers,” Shah told reporters at Deploy. Post-election, would-be LPO borrowers are motivated to move more quickly than they were in the early years of Biden’s term, he added. “Our process hasn't changed. Their ability to move through it faster is in their control.”

That increased urgency is also evident in the office’s remaining pipeline of active applications, i.e. for projects that have not yet been offered conditional commitments. In November 2023, LPO reported 125 active applications, totalling $174.7 billion. By last month, the office had 212, totalling $324.3 billion.

https://preview.redd.it/opzuvhgqi76e1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a749b8650d62c9d9e78eaf3f73244a1b6a2741d

The makeup of sectors seeking LPO funding has also shifted dramatically, even in the last year. In January 2024, it was virtual power plant companies that were requesting the most funding, followed by renewables development, transmission, and clean fuels. By November, renewables development moved into the top spot, closely followed by advanced nuclear. 

# The bounds of the process

The process of receiving a loan from LPO is an arduous one. It inevitably takes several months from start to finish, regardless of how eager an applicant may be. 

“There is no way that you would choose the Loan Programs Office if you could easily get money out of the commercial markets,” Shah explained. “Our process is always going to be more difficult, more bureaucratic.”

Nancy Loewe, CFO of [finalized loan recipient CelLink](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-362-million-loan-cellink-support-domestic), agreed. If the company could have gotten financing for their Texas manufacturing facility elsewhere, she said, they certainly would have. “I really tried to find alternatives because I was trying to avoid \[the LPO process\]” Loewe added. “But the terms on this are undeniable.”

For instance, LPO gives CelLink a so-called “payment holiday” before it must start repaying the loan. “That’s exactly when a small company like ours needs it,” she explained. Alternative equipment financing options that the company considered required repayment starting within a year. 

“We need the funding to last a couple years while we build out the factory, and that’s where I think the DOE is invested long-term,” Loewe said. CelLink’s $362 million loan took nearly a year to finalize after receiving a conditional commitment in May 2023.

There is no way that you would choose the Loan Programs Office if you could easily get money out of the commercial markets. Our process is always going to be more difficult, more bureaucratic.Jigar Shah, director of DOE's Loan Programs Office

But loans being finalized this month are happening much more quickly. Entek, which received $1.3 billion to manufacture lithium-ion battery separators for EVs, finalized its loan in around six months. And loans are also moving from application to conditional commitments much more quickly.

That said, there’s a limit to how quickly the process can happen. Every loan approved by LPO must also be approved by the Energy Secretary, the White House Office of Management and Budget, and the Treasury Department, among others. 

And many companies applying for loans aren’t readily able to do the due diligence and reporting required by the office, or else don’t have the needed legal teams on retainer. As Allen Cadreau, founder and CEO of loan recipient Indian Energy put it: “Legal fees are a horse of another color. We’ve gotta figure something out about that.” Indian Energy, he said, had seven different law firms vet the project over the course of three years to lock in the funding.

So loans that were already in the works as late as this summer could still be finalized before January 17, the Biden administration’s last working day. For those that have entered the pipeline in recent months, though, the outlook is more challenging.

# Prepping for a Trump LPO

Especially for companies that have received conditional commitments from LPO, a quiet effort to “Trump-proof” themselves is underway. The hope is that loans described in terms of domestic manufacturing or American innovation will be preserved despite the likely political upheaval to come. 

Between conditional commitments and finalized loans, LPO has agreed to around $55 billion in loans to 33 projects spanning battery production, nuclear, and virtual power plants. That amounts to just over an eighth of the office’s total $400 billion loan authority. (And the office has been pointed in its vocabulary throughout the Biden administration; you’d be hard put to find the words “climate” or “green” anywhere in the office’s announcements or materials.)

But Project 2025, the conservative policy initiative from the Heritage Foundation and former Trump officials, calls for the Loan Programs Office to be eliminated entirely. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, co-leads of the new Department of Government Efficiency, have said the office — [and its already-approved loans](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/12/03/ramaswamy-takes-aim-at-doe-loan-funds-00192326) — are in their budget-cutting crosshairs. 

(Musk, incidentally, is one of the most prominent users of the Loan Programs Office, having [borrowed $465 million](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/tesla) in the early days of Tesla for the company’s factory in Fremont, California. Tesla repaid its loan in full three years later.)The makeup of sectors seeking LPO funding has also shifted dramatically, even in the last year. In January 2024, it was virtual power plant companies that were requesting the most funding, followed by renewables development, transmission, and clean fuels. By November, renewables development moved into the top spot, closely followed by advanced nuclear.

Among the outstanding conditional commitments yet to be finalized are a $6.5 billion loan to help Rivian build a massive manufacturing facility in Georgia, and $9.2 billion for BlueOval SK LLC to build three plants to churn out electric vehicle batteries for Ford.

After Trump’s win, though, many loan recipients are already planning for how to engage with  the incoming administration.

Sustainable aviation fuel maker Gevo, for example, [received a conditional commitment](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-gevo-net-zero-corn-starch-sustainable-aviation) in October, but has been public about the fact that they won’t be able to finalize their $1.46 billion loan before Inauguration Day.

The delay, CEO Patrick Gruber told *Latitude Media*, is largely on the Gevo side. Specifically, they need to shore up companion funding before finalizing the LPO dollars. He said  the company is looking forward to working with the incoming Trump administration to finalize the loan. 

Gevo isn’t worried about the future of the loan, he added, given the fact that their South Dakota corn starch-to-jet fuel facility isn’t particularly partisan; in fact, last year, corn-state Republicans in the House made their support for increasing the debt limit contingent upon [preserving biofuel tax credits](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/3984389-ethanol-dispute-shows-power-of-regional-interests-in-narrow-gop-majority/) extended by Democrats.

Other loan recipients are taking a different approach to keeping their heads down. The Grainbelt Express, for example, [received a conditional commitment](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-grain-belt-express-construct-high-voltage-direct) in November for up to nearly $5 billion to help build the high voltage, interregional transmission line. That project has been [mired in partisan debate](https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/the-midwests-transmission-backslide) for several years now, and the company opted not to do any publicity for the LPO loan commitment, sticking only to the requisite announcement on LPO’s own site. Grainbelt Express’s website still does not include any mention of the loan.

# The Biden LPO’s legacy

Even companies that have their loans finalized — and are ostensibly in a more secure position — are doing some strategic planning. CelLink, for example, is taking its loan in tranches, and has currently taken just on $73 million installment, of the $362 million it has available. 

“That makes me nervous for next year, because who knows?” Loewe said. “They can’t take this away from us, but it does change our thought process in terms of making sure we’re only \[accepting\] what we really need. I don’t want to take on more government debt with the uncertainty of ‘are the Republicans going to keep \[LPO\] or not’.”

Moving into 2025, CelLink is going to get “very creative” with equity raises, she added, to make sure the company only borrows from its LPO loan “if we really have to.”

At the same time, Loewe said, LPO’s stamp of approval has given the company “so much more credibility” with customers. In the months after finalizing CelLink’s loan in April, she said, they were able to sign a massive, multi-year deal that will “fill our factory in Texas.”

Meanwhile, Holtec International is using a finalized LPO loan to restart an 800-megawatt nuclear generating station in Michigan. Pat O’Brien, who leads the company’s government affairs, said that financing is already helping to de-risk nuclear energy even beyond their specific project. “In the last two months, I’ve had more financial institutions reach out to say ‘Hey, can we just do a Q&A with you to ask about where nuclear is headed and what it is?’, because they’re getting interested,” he said.

Despite the furious conversations underway about  the future of the Department of Energy and [unspent IRA funding](https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/which-clean-energy-tax-credits-are-most-at-risk-under-trump) more broadly, Shah is confident that the office’s impact will endure long-term.

""You won't know, obviously, until it's in the rearview mirror,"" he told *Latitude Media*, ""but I really think that we have reset the way in which America commercializes innovation forever.""

# GIVEN BACK IN 2021 & THE TRAIL OF QUESTIONS WHEN ASKED- 

# Please see Jim's responses 6/17/2021-

**(Jim...Private funding methods have been the primary target however, ... can you offer any comment to the following questions.)**

**a) Does/Can Niocorp qualify for a U.S. govt. (DOE/DOD) Loan, or Loan Guarantee as described above or similar ?**

**\*\*RESPONSE**

***""Quite possibly, and we are in discussions with them on this now. However, the ability of this program to fund critical minerals projects will depend upon what the Democratic leadership in Congress enacts in its appropriations bills, as new funding is required to cover the credit subsidy cost of these loans. In recent years, the Congressional appropriations process has been a very politically contentious with little bipartisan agreement on much of anything. Some opposition in the Congress has already quietly developed to the Administration’s proposal to expand this program’s traditional funding focus to include critical minerals mines, which it has not funded in the past. Regardless, it is not likely that funding levels for the credit subsidies used by these programs will be finalized until late this year, or into next year.***

***I will add that our team is very familiar with the DOE Loan Guarantee program, as we navigated this process some years ago. It is a very slow process and requires more than a year (for some projects) to complete. It also costs a great deal of money and resources in which to engage in this process – those costs can easily grow into the 7 figures. We continue to examine the possibilities here, however.""***

**b) Has Niocorp possibly applied for a U.S. govt. Loan, or Loan Guarantee as described in the context above?**

**\*\*RESPONSE**

# ""No decision has yet been made as to whether or not to submit a formal application to this program, as our primary financing focus has been on private sector sources.""

# ****THEN ON - 12/22/2021 Jim:

**a) Has Niocorp recently applied for a U.S. govt. Loan, or Loan Guarantee as described in the context above?**

**\*\*RESPONSE**

# ""We are currently examining whether or not NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project would qualify for debt financing under the DOE/ LGP program.

# Thx, Jim""

# Please see Jim's response to questions posed for comment-3/17/2022:

**A) Could you comment on what the production of higher purity niobium & titanium could be utilized for once realized?**

**\*\*RESPONSE**

""If the higher purity niobium and titanium intermediates that L3 was able to produce at bench-scale are replicated and proven at demonstration scale, this would put us in a position to more easily move to other products beyond those outlined in our 2019 Feasibility Study. **Niobium oxide for use in Li-Ion batteries is one possible example, although the production of that product would require additional processing steps beyond the higher-purity niobium intermediate that we discussed in last week’s news release. The company is not yet in a position to make a determination on whether or not, and when, to possibly expand our Niobium product offering.** **Higher grade TiO2 could expose us to additional markets where higher margins could be obtained. But, again, we are not in a position to speak to those possibilities in any detail yet.**""

**B) Niocorp’s preferred separation method is SX. Are these higher purity processes part of an improved SX process or “something else”?**

**\*\*RESPONSE**

""No, the processes we recently discussed occur in the earlier stages of the flowsheet, prior to any SX processing. We look forward to unveiling those details once these processes are verified at the demonstration plant level and once all associated work needed to complete an updated Feasibility Study is completed.""

# 5/27/2022 -How Does Niocorp's Elk Creek Project compare to other ""World Class Projects?""

**\*\*\*RESPONSE**

""It is a bit tricky to compare rare earth projects on an apples-to-apples basis, which is why we chose to limit the comparison of our Elk Creek resource to other REE projects in the U.S. There are several reasons why. For one, there are several different legal systems that determine how a project can measure and disclose aspects of its mineral resource and/or reserve. For public companies that are SEC-reporting entities (such as NioCorp), the SK1300 standard must be followed. For public companies regulated by Canadian authorities (also such as NioCorp), there is the National Instrument 43-101 disclosure standard. In Australia, there is the JORC standard. Each of these systems differ in what they allow, or don't allow, in terms of public disclosure of mineral resources and reserves. This can lead to 'apples-to-oranges' comparisons among projects. Another challenge in making such comparisons is the mineralization of an REE project. Some projects can show a high ore grade of rare earths, but the mineralization of the ore is something that is very difficult to process. For example, rare earth projects based on silicate-based minerals -- such as eudialyte -- are extraordinarily difficult to economically process in order to pull the REEs out and separate them. Others can contain relatively high levels of other impurities, such as naturally occurring radioactive elements, that can increase the cost of processing. A high ore grade doesn't mean a lot if the REE mineralization isn't amenable to processing that is technically or economically infeasible. This is why only a small handful of the more than 200 REE-containing minerals have ever been successfully processed economically at commercial scale. (The two primary REE-containing minerals in the Elk Creek Project, bastnasite and monazite, are among those that have been successfully processed for decades).Rare earth resources also differ in terms of the relative distribution of individual REEs in the host mineral. Some may have a relatively high ore grade but also have high percentages of less valuable REEs, such as cerium or lanthanum or yttrium. Others have lower ore grades but their REE mineralization is skewed more favorably to higher-value REEs, such as the magnetics neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium which are used in NdFeB magnets. There are several other REEs that are also magnetic, such as samarium, but those are of lower value. Another way that REE projects are compared to one another is through a so-called “basket price.” This is a particularly misleading way of valuing a rare earth play, in my opinion, because a project’s ‘basket price’ assigns a dollar value to the individual REEs in the ore, multiplying total tonnes of each REE by current market price for that REE, and combines them all together. This assumes that a project will produce each and every one of the REEs in the ‘basket’ (which is almost never the case). It also ignores the enormous CAPEX and OPEX required to produce 14 or so individual REEs.

**There are yet other factors that help determine the viability of a potential rare earth project. \~Some projects are aimed at only producing rare earths. That means that they are relatively riskier investments than projects that are designed to produce multiple products in addition to rare earths.**

***\~Some projects that are relatively large in size, have high ore grades, and are comprised of processable minerals -- but they are located in places that make mining and processing difficult or very expensive. I can think of a few projects that are touted as attractive deposits but are located near or above the Arctic Circle, which generally makes mining more costly.***

***\~ Others are located in places where there local residents, such as First Nations communities in Canada or anywhere in Greenland, can readily block a project from moving to commercial operation. Still others are in countries where local governments are less stable than in the U.S., or are simply prone to corruption, which exposes the project to high country risk.***

***\~Many REE projects are proposed by teams that have no experience in commercially processing REEs. They tend to gloss over that fact. Knowing what I know about the challenges of producing separated, high-purity REEs, this is one of the most important factors I consider when I look at REE projects. But that is just my opinion.***

A more useful comparison strategy for investors is to look at rare earth projects through multiple lenses, such as those I describe above. It is not easy to do this if one doesn’t have a pretty deep understanding of the REE industry and the challenges of successfully making these strategic metals.

# Having said all of that, it’s clear that our Elk Creek carbonatite is very large and similar in total contained rare earths to some of the largest known rare earth resources in the world, including the Araxa carbonatite in Brazil and the St. Honore carbonatite in Quebec.""

# On 8/3/2022 :

**Jim- Could you offer comment on how this may affect the Elk Creek Mine moving forward?) 117th Cong., 1st Sess. H. R. 5376**

[H.R.5376 - 117th Congress (2021-2022): Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 | Congress.gov | Library of Congress](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376)

**\*\*\*Response:**

""The Senate Democrats’ “Inflation Reduction Act of 2022” legislation does indeed include several provisions that may be helpful to the Elk Creek Project. These include both production tax credits that would apply to all the critical minerals that we intend to produce, additional funding for the DPA Title III program aimed at supporting critical minerals production, and additional lending authority for the Title XVII program at DOE. If these provisions survive the amendment processes in the Senate and House, the Byrd Rule in the Senate, and can be passed by both Houses of Congress and is signed into law, it could have multiple positive impacts to the Project.

The bill text, as is presently available publicly, is attached. This bill will undoubtedly change when the Senate takes up the reconciliation process, as reconciliation does not limit amendments. There will be many amendments offered by both sides. Some of the bill’s provisions may not survive challenges on the Senate floor under what we call the “Byrd Rule.” Additionally, implementing regulations must be written by agencies of jurisdiction following the bill’s enactment into law to determine many of the details of various programs and funding initiatives. As always with government programs and processes, little happens quickly.

Apart from this bill’s proposed provisions, we have been working with several federal agencies regarding potential assistance to the Elk Creek Project, but those agencies do not allow us to disclose any details of those processes. ""

All the best, Jim

# DEC. 10th 2024~ Idaho Antimony Mine Soon Goes Live Amid Rising U.S.-China Trade War

[Idaho Antimony Mine Soon Goes Live Amid Rising U.S.-China Trade War](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2024/12/10/idaho-antimony-mine-soon-goes-live-amid-rising-us-china-trade-war/)

[US President Joe Biden \(L\) shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the ... \[+\]POOL\/AFP via Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/j52fljilj76e1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbe5dc048149cf7582b95a3fd79ba246fde2bc37)

China’s communist government [moved last week](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-bans-exports-gallium-germanium-antimony-us-2024-12-03/) to ban exports of three key energy minerals - gallium, germanium, and antimony - to the United States as tensions between the two world powers continue to escalate during the presidential transition period. The three minerals at play in this US/China trade war have a wide range of applications, including for the military, batteries, and renewable energy.

""In principle, the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials to the United States shall not be permitted,"" the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a written directive published December 3.

# An Escalating US/China Trade War

China’s latest move to limit exports of rare earth and critical energy minerals with military applications to the US market came a day after the [Biden administration announced ](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/us-announces-new-export-controls-china-chip-industry-rcna182579)enhanced semiconductor export controls specific to China, the third such crackdown in the past three years. The US limits will apply to 140 Chinese companies and will limit exports of the kinds of high-bandwidth chips that are crucial for development of AI applications for military and other purposes.

Biden Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a release that the latest move is intended to prevent China from “advancing its domestic semiconductor manufacturing system, which it will use to support its military modernization.”

The US has become self-sufficient in producing some of the minerals in question in times past. But the [decision by policymakers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2021/05/30/the-energy-transition-wont-happen-without-secure-mineral-supply-chains/?sh=4f7c67b86e1c) and regulators in the US and other OECD nations to make the approval of new mines near-impossible starting in the 1970s put an end to that, enabling China to move to dominate the mining, processing, and supply chains for these key minerals over the last 40 years. As a result, these countries and others have become largely reliant on imports from China for their needs.

# An Opportunity Related To Antimony

Where antimony is concerned, this could all be about to change. As a reference for those unfamiliar with this critical mineral, I detailed the myriad military and technological applications for antimony [in a story published](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2021/05/06/antimony-the-most-important-mineral-you-never-heard-of/) in May 2021. That is one of a series of stories I’ve written here since 2021 about the efforts by mining company Perpetua Resources to restart the mothballed Stibnite Mine in central Idaho.

Originally established as a gold mining operation in 1927, the Stibnite mine later discovered a large store of antimony, and was able to supply over 90% of the antimony - crucial to the production of tungsten steel - required by the US military during World War II. Output from the mine went into a gradual decline following the War, and it was mothballed in 1996. Recognizing a growing need for new domestic resources of antimony, Perpetua Resources acquired the mine and has been working for well over a decade now to obtain the federal state and federal permits needed to reopen its operations.

In addition to the again-rising needs of the military, antimony is also a critical ingredient in most modern technologies, including those critical to the success of electric vehicles and wind and solar power development. From a national security standpoint, it is now obviously problematic that the U.S. is now unable to supply the vast majority of its antimony needs. Perpetua Resources believes that, once reopened, the Stibnite Mine can provide up to 35% of US needs of this critical mineral.

In a timely coincidence of events, relief could be on the way. The U.S. Forest Service [announced in September](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2024/09/08/idaho-antimony-mining-project-moves-a-step-closer-to-reality/) the publication of a draft record of decision (ROD) authorizing Perpetua to start up operations at the Stibnite mine. If all goes to schedule under the requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act, the final decision could come before the end of December.

Anticipating that positive outcome, and in response to the rising trade war between the US and China, Perpetua Resources [announced Monday](https://www.mining.com/web/perpetua-resources-and-sunshine-silver-to-explore-antimony-processing-in-idaho/) it has entered into a non-binding agreement with Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining to explore the potential for the domestic processing of the antimony recovered from he Stibnite mine.

“Stibnite gold project is the only identified domestic reserve of antimony, and with final federal decisions expected in a matter of weeks, Perpetua is ready to work with US companies to help secure domestic production of antimony,” Perpetua CEO Jon Cherry said.

[stibnite crystal mineral sample, a semi precious rare earth mineralgetty](https://preview.redd.it/262tq45uj76e1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=23e13c572ae47e8ae7f67bc024e37c04584f87c7)

A wise person once observed that timing is everything in life, and the looming completion of this complex permitting process related to the Stibnite Mine seems a prime example barring further delays. It could become a fortunate example of one door flying open as another closes.

But it is key to remember that the US has to this point been sourcing the vast majority of its antimony needs from China and that it will take months if not years to bring this single mine to full production. Then there’s the fact that antimony is but one of an array of rare earth and critical energy minerals for which similar supply issues will now exist in the wake of the Chinese embargo.

# The Bottom Line: A Big Mess To Clean Up

As he ramped up his administration’s attempt to force a heavily subsidized energy transition on the American public in 2021, Joe Biden [famously committed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2022/03/01/on-energy-mineral-supply-chains-biden-faces-an-existential-conflict/) to mount a “whole of government effort” to secure new supply chains outside of Chinese domination for these mineral needs. To date, these efforts have been sporadic and largely unsuccessful. This reality, combined with this accelerating trade war between the US and China and the interminable state and federal permitting processes now threaten to fully stall an already slowing transition.

When he assumes office on January 20, President-elect Donald Trump and his appointees are going to have one big mess on their plate where these minerals are concerned unless this US/China trade war is quickly resolved.

We minimise our chances of failure by maximising our chances of success.

The kendu army is relentless in our methods because we know this is the recipe for success. We already hit an ATH of 280M in the bullrun teaser.

Now, with an army around 2.5x since ATH, more CEXs, access and eyes, imagine our possibilities now.

——

You may be new to the community and not realise how truly important you could be in the story of Kendu. How much your effort may mean.

We are all equally important, with individual skillsets and networks, all with our own abilities to get in as many people as possible in that only we know.

Your parents, friends, coworkers, whomever.

This is how we grow. This is how we hit the billions.

Already, our community members have created things such energy drinks, coffee, smashed certik organically, have our own dedicated stocktwits page, and been noticed by okx, coinbase and bitget organically.

Now, imagine the power if EVERYONE completely activated and followed the blueprint in how to succeed.

This is the recipe for success. This is the same way SHIB did it, the same way we are doing it, just even better.

This is said to highlight just how truly powerful everyone of us can be. How truly large a roll we can all play.

I said I was going home to get on with stuff, I couldn't really talk as her ex was there at the time. 
I feel hurt that she's saving her energy for others.
I feel like an arse for not just deciding whether I'm happy with what we have without reference to what she's doing with others.

She’s the kind of cat that opens cabinets, hides her toys in places only she remembers, and gives me judgmental looks when I do something clumsy. But yesterday? She hit a new level of genius (or diabolical scheming).

I was working from home, and Mochi was being her usual curious self, sitting on my keyboard and swatting at my mouse. To keep her entertained, I got up and opened a jar of her favorite treats, planning to give her one so she’d leave me alone. But as I reached for the jar, I knocked over my coffee. Chaos ensued.

While I cleaned up the spill, Mochi just sat there watching me with this calm, unbothered expression. I was in the middle of muttering curses when I heard the unmistakable pop of the treat jar lid. I turned around to see Mochi, with one paw on the counter, having somehow nudged the jar open. She looked straight at me, grabbed a treat in her mouth, and casually strutted away.

The best (or most concerning?) part? She closed the jar lid with her paw as she left. I swear I’m not imagining it.

1hbrpr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1hbrpr0/i_dont_want_to_be_like_this/,I don't want to be like this.,"I haven't been in school for almost four to six years. Not because I hate school, but because my family cannot afford it. Every day when I look outside, when I look at social media, I see people my age going to school, making friends in class, while I stay here at home with stupidity as my company. My sister goes to school, and whenever she comes home, dressed up in uniform, I cry myself to sleep at night wishing that I had the privilege to be schooled too. I want to study, I want to learn, I want to make friends and weave my way into society like everybody else, but I can't. Years I've dealt with it, years I've tried to understand and accept it, but it doesn't make me feel any better knowing that my years that could've been spent on living some of the most memorable moments of my life, like the finals and prom and even something as simple as walking home from school is being wasted.

I try my best to study by myself, to try and make things right by myself. But I can't just do this alone. I try so hard but I can't push past my limits. I don't want to be stupid, I really don't. I don't have to be the best, I just don't want to become uneducated forever. I want to be able to wear a school uniform. I want to be able to visit the library to study. I want to stress over schoolwork. I want to wear a student ID or a simple school lanyard around my neck! I don't care about sleepless nights, stress and labor, or chugging coffee in the wee hours of the morning, because I already do those things! Where would I even go when the time comes that I have to go? What would I be able to become? What could I even contribute to society? I don't want to be scum! I don't want to be called stupid or dumb.

And now that it's finals for other people, it sinks deep within me. Everyone is studying, everyone is staying up late for school and studies, preparing and paving a way for their futures and I'm just here, paving a way to becoming an idiotic, background character.

1hbro5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portuguese/comments/1hbro5x/quick_guide_to_de_in_portuguese/,"Quick Guide to ""De"" in Portuguese","

The preposition ""de"" is one of the most versatile words in Portuguese. It translates to ""of,"" ""from,"" ""about,"" and even combines with articles and pronouns to form contractions (e.g., ""do,"" ""da,"" ""dela""). Here's a detailed guide to its uses and nuances:


---

1. ""De"" = Possession (Of)

Used to indicate possession or relationship, similar to ""of"" in English.

O carro de João.
João's car.

A casa de madeira.
The wooden house (house of wood).



---

2. ""De"" = Origin/Source (From)

Indicates where something or someone comes from.

Eu sou de São Paulo.
I am from São Paulo.

Este vinho é de Portugal.
This wine is from Portugal.



---

3. ""De"" = Cause/Reason

Used to explain a cause or reason.

Ele morreu de fome.
He died of hunger.

Estou cansado de tanto trabalhar.
I’m tired from working so much.



---

4. ""De"" = Material/Content

Indicates what something is made of or contains.

Uma mesa de vidro.
A table made of glass.

Uma xícara de café.
A cup of coffee.



---

5. ""De"" = Topic/About

Indicates the subject of a conversation or text.

Estamos falando de viagens.
We’re talking about trips.

O filme é de terror.
The movie is about horror.



---

6. ""De"" in Comparisons

Used in constructions of comparison.

Ele é mais alto do que o irmão.
He is taller than his brother.

Essa bolsa é maior do que a outra.
This bag is bigger than the other one.



---

7. ""De"" in Time Expressions

Indicates time, often with idiomatic expressions.

De manhã.
In the morning.

De noite.
At night.



---

8. ""De"" + Verbs

Often used to connect verbs, either infinitives or participles.

Esqueça de fechar a porta.
Forget to close the door.

Pare de reclamar!
Stop complaining!



---

9. ""De"" in Contractions

""De"" contracts with definite articles, pronouns, and demonstratives:

With Articles:

De + o = do (masculine singular)
Do carro. (Of the car)

De + a = da (feminine singular)
Da casa. (Of the house)

De + os = dos (masculine plural)
Dos amigos. (Of the friends)

De + as = das (feminine plural)
Das pessoas. (Of the people)


With Pronouns:

Dele / Dela = Of him/her
O carro é dele. (The car is his.)
A bolsa é dela. (The bag is hers.)

Deles / Delas = Of them
A culpa é deles. (The fault is theirs.)


With Demonstratives:

De + este = deste
Gostei deste filme. (I liked this movie.)

De + essa = dessa
Falamos dessa ideia ontem. (We talked about that idea yesterday.)



---

10. Idiomatic Expressions with ""De""

De vez em quando.
From time to time.

De jeito nenhum.
No way.

De repente.
Suddenly.

De graça.
For free.

De novo.
Again.



---

11. Challenges with ""De"" in Translation

""De"" often has no direct equivalent in English. Context is key:

Tenho medo de altura.
I’m afraid of heights.

Preciso de ajuda.
I need help. (No ""of"" in English.)



---

In Portuguese, some verbs are always followed by prepositions like ""de"" due to grammatical rules and the nature of the verb itself. This is often a challenge for learners because these prepositions don’t always translate directly into English or other languages.

Here’s a detailed explanation:


---

Why Verbs Like ""Gostar"" Require ""De""?

The verb ""gostar"" (to like) inherently requires the preposition ""de"" to link it to its object. In grammar, we call this a prepositional verb because it cannot connect to its object without a preposition.

Example:

Eu gosto de chocolate.
(I like chocolate.)


Here, ""de"" serves as the link between ""gostar"" and ""chocolate"". You cannot say ""Eu gosto chocolate""—it would be incorrect.


---

Which Verbs Require ""De""?

Here are some common verbs that require ""de"" and their meanings:

1. Gostar de (To Like)

Eu gosto de livros.
I like books.


2. Precisar de (To Need)

Eu preciso de ajuda.
I need help.


3. Lembrar-se de (To Remember)

Eu me lembro de você.
I remember you.


4. Cuidar de (To Take Care Of)

Ela cuida de crianças.
She takes care of children.


5. Ter medo de (To Be Afraid Of)

Eu tenho medo de altura.
I am afraid of heights.


6. Falar de (To Talk About)

Estamos falando de viagens.
We’re talking about trips.


7. Depender de (To Depend On)

Isso depende de você.
That depends on you.


8. Desistir de (To Give Up On)

Eu desisti de estudar medicina.
I gave up studying medicine.



---

Why Does Portuguese Use Prepositions This Way?

1. Historical Grammar:
Portuguese evolved from Latin, and many verbs in Latin were inherently tied to prepositions. This grammatical relationship carried into Portuguese.


2. Clarity:
Prepositions help specify the relationship between the verb and the object.

""Eu gosto de sorvete."" (I like ice cream.)
The preposition ""de"" helps make the connection clear.



3. Verb-Specific Rules:
Some verbs are simply defined as requiring prepositions, much like how in English we say ""depend on"" or ""think of.""




---

Common Learner Challenges

1. Direct vs. Prepositional Verbs:
In English, you say ""I like chocolate"", with no preposition. But in Portuguese, you must say ""Eu gosto de chocolate"". This difference often feels unnatural at first.


2. Dropping ""De"":
In informal speech, native speakers may occasionally omit ""de"" when it’s implied, but this is not grammatically correct:

""Eu gosto chocolate."" (Incorrect, but some may say this casually.)



3. Contractions with ""De"":
Prepositions like ""de"" contract with definite articles, which can confuse learners:

""Eu gosto do livro."" (I like the book.)
(De + o = do)

I obviously don’t believe everthing I hear on tv or the internet, but I did wonder.

1hbrlwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hbrlwy/experience_with_a_manipulator/,Experience with a manipulator,"So my text will start with simple question; what would you have done if you had faced a person who is a good manipulator? I've rephrasized this statement in 3rd conditional on purpose, simply because these people are very rare.

So to begin with my story. On college I met one specific girl, for the sake of privacy let's call her Karen. At the first she seemed to be just a normal girl but soon I found out her real persona.

I started hanging out with her often (this proved to be fatal mistake). Soon she started with simply being nice and she was really trying to build up a character, I'll give her that. After a while she started to ask for favors, nothing special in particular, like 'can you watch this video I sent you?', things like that. Favors by the time being became higher and higher to the point where she framed these requests and favors as something I have to do because I would look nice and such. To be clear, I stated to her that I like my own style, that her 'requests' don't make any sense. Then she apologized and I thought she would stopped. Oh boy, I was so wrong.

She gave herself an efforts and during all these meetings with her I started testing her with subtle things, i.e. mirroring her actions, she certainly didn't like that. This confirmed my theory she manipulates me. Also to not forget, she is bisexual, this isn't problem at all but during our conversations she always tries to tell me I should comment every guy and girl, even though I don't do that. It's childish thing to do. She also gaslights a lot, i.e. I tell her a joke and then she frames me how that joke is hurting her. She also told me other day how she wants to know everything I do. I'll give you an example for the last one; after class I went to the coffee with other friends. There were also one girl who lived near university and she mentioned how she has a lot of homework and we can all go to her place but she bragged to everyone how she would be ashamed if anyone of us sees her messy apartment. We said that we don't mind it. Then we all went to her. Later, Karen found out I was in that apartment, doing and helping with the homework and she accused me of being ride because I violated privacy of the girl who offered us to go to her apartment. I said how we all agreed on that. Karen told me how her telling us that her apartment is messy was sorta a message to me that I'm not welcomed. Little detail: she didn't specifically said it to me but rather the whole group. So Karen is distorting a facts. Nothing new.

Little did she know that I can also be a good manipulator, why I know that? Simply because I'm smart, I was reading all that before and I know this stuff. My current plan is to try presenting her to the others how she is mean and bad using the stealth method. Which is all about doing it secretly, in my case, initiating topics that will encourage conflicted opinions etc. Basically divide and conquer method. So far it's going good.

Tell me your opinions on this.

I tend to find my way around software easier than my colleagues in most fields... but MOSAIQ Is still as perplexing as it was the first day I started using it.

We use MOSAIQ to manage patient files, check in patients and manage queueing, manage doctor diaries/schedules, book appointments, do QCLs (layman term: request), print pathology forms, daily masters, scan documents, and manage insurances/auths/referrals.

So many things about this software are so unintuitive.

* Is it really that hard to have some kind of indicator that you've selected more than one blood form (echart > orders)? Why is it space to select multiple, and why aren't my selections highlighted or marked with at least SOMETHING? The only way you would know is when attempting to print/do a print preview with the awful controls of Crystal Reports. \* That's when you then ask, ""why can't I make it **not** print double-sided?"". Look, saving the environment is important, but so is giving a valid blood form!
* Why, when I click a patient on the daily master or the location schedule, right-click and open patient schedule or open patient chart only, does it either jump to someone completely different or refresh the current patient >60% of the time? I'm looking at that patient, they're highlighted, they even have the dotted grey lines around them, so just pick that one!! CTRL+F2 doesn't even work, so why bother putting an indicator of the hotkey there?
   * While we're at it, why does the patient schedule look different if you decide to open it with the menu shortcut button you add yourself to the top toolbar?!
   * Also, why can't I just run a simple search on a schedule with ctrl+F? Why does it need to match an EXACT patient?! This just makes it so tedious to search for someone and you end up jumping through hoops to find the fastest way there. Compound it with the fact that MOSAIQ just looks terrible and feels like staring directly into the sun, and wow, eye strain + brain pain!

.

* In a patient's schedule (hot tip: to get there fast, alt+S > P but make sure you're on the right window), why is ""All to date"" and ""All"" when displaying patient appointments different? ""All to date"" hides some appointments, though I haven't figured out the pattern yet. It's so annoying because I just want a hotkey to see all appointments in the patient's schedule history, but I always need to use the mouse to click ""All""!
* Why can I only unqueue a patient by going Schedule > Queue > Patient > Delete? Why can't I just open/change the appointment and unqueue the appointment via the status menu or something there? I know nurses who don't know how to unqueue patients even after they've worked there for a good decade because of this...
* Everything feels like it has more menus and dialogue boxes than is necessary. The aforementioned queue thing is one of them, and insurance/referrals is another. They shouldn't even allow more than two primary forms of payment - some admin in my department absolutely butcher it and it is a total crapshoot when you reveal all the payees there (3 Medicares, maybe a few private insurance, and a DVA for good measure, all PRIMARY with the rare SECONDARY, and once in a blue moon, TERTIARY). However, that is probably just the fault of my department rather than MOSAIQ, but at the very least they could do something to manage it.
* Speaking of auth as well, we can't even duplicate an auth entry and then modify it. Do people seriously need to fill out that stupid form for the exact same doctors for the 1000th time?! It's completely fine if you're only managing a few auths a day, but it's not fine at all when you need to do 20 of them almost back-to-back!! Having at least the option for a template would be really nice!

.

* Document scanning is a meme too. I only recently discovered that while building scanned documents, you could drag something from the staging folder back into the original folder. When you ""delete"" from the staging folder, it sounds like you are permanently removing it but you are just unstaging it (and it doesn't even return back to the original folder unless you refresh). Someone on the MOSAIQ team apparently didn't study English, or enjoys watching people flounder. Just rename the delete button ""unstage""!
* If you accidentally spill your coffee on your keyboard and remove the document viewer and page thumbnails while you're at it, good luck. You can recover the document viewer by going to the title bar of the document scanner window (NOT the actual title bar but the dark blue one with the upside-down triangle on it), click the triangle dropdown and select document viewer there.
   * If you lost the page previews thumbnail list thing on the left, congratulations because you're about to do the most mind-bending thing ever to restore ONE menu... and by the way, my coworker did that, asked our local MOSAIQ team for help, and they didn't know how to fix it, so I figured the cursed thing out myself and it took 10 MINUTES for something that should've taken SECONDS!! For something so easy to remove, it should be easy to add back!
   * What you do: right-click on the blank space at the end of the first toolbar below all the fields where you specify the document source/type/etc, enable the document options toolbar, click options (should be the bottom-left corner of the window), view > pages thumbnails.
   * Most sane individuals would at that point try to reset the UI. I don't remember if that worked, but it probably didn't if my coworker called for support. Good luck finding that option too, by the way.

.

* Importing images for patient photos is also archaic- why so many buttons? At least it's functional, but sometimes MOSAIQ will eat the photo and I will never see it again (and not because it's in the wrong section lmao).
* If you remove the little window with their picture as well, guess how you can restore it...
   * Did you think to go to the view menu or something? Guess what, you're wrong!
   * First go to select patient, right-click, and viola the option is right there. If you didn't guess that, you're stupid, according to whoever designed the software.
* Why does the patient search menu sometimes disappear behind everything else?! Can MOSAIQ disappear along with it too so I don't have to endure this torment anymore?
* When I do ctrl+backspace to try and remove a word, it puts a REALLY NICE BOX that looks like a missing emoji there instead. Yes, thank you MOSAIQ, that's exactly what I need while I have patients waiting in front of me waiting to finish making the darn appointment comment before I can finish serving them. It's not like it does that box thing everywhere either - sometimes, it will actually backspace a whole word. It depends on where you are, but it really shouldn't.

These are just a **few** of my gripes with this terrible software.  
Whoever awarded Elekta with software of the year awards or whatever on LinkedIn (the thing they keep bragging about) needs to reevaluate what good software looks like, because this isn't it.

I know it was designed in the 80s or something, but boy Elekta really failed this one... and it's part of their cash cow setup! I'm fighting it literally every working day and it just makes working so much more frustrating than it ought to be, and that's coming from someone in a customer service position, which is already frustrating enough.  
I imagine it's even worse for people who have to touch the other parts of this stinky old dinosaur, like med physicists.

# Introduction: What's Kyros All About?

Hey there! Have you heard about Kyros? It's this new app that's been making waves in the affiliate marketing world, and I've got to say, it's pretty exciting stuff. Imagine being able to promote affiliate links and make money without having to do all the heavy lifting yourself. That's what Kyros promises, and let me tell you, it's got my attention.

Kyros is billing itself as a ""ChatGPT-4.o"" app that can automatically promote any affiliate link, potentially earning you passive income every day. Now, I know what you're thinking - ""That sounds too good to be true!"" I was skeptical at first too, but after digging into it, I think there might be something to this.

The app launched on December 10, 2024, and it's built on the latest ChatGPT update. The idea is that it uses advanced AI to do all the promotional work for you. No need for tech skills, a big email list, or a huge budget. It's designed to level the playing field for beginners in the affiliate marketing game.

But does it really work? Can it actually help you make money while you sleep? That's what we're here to find out. I've been testing Kyros, and I'm ready to share my honest thoughts. So, grab a cup of coffee, get comfortable, and let's dive into this Kyros review together.

[Kyros Review: Earn Passive Income Daily with Automated Affiliate Marketing](https://reddit.com/link/1hbrfla/video/camdi8dxf76e1/player)

# Features and Content: What Does Kyros Offer?

Alright, let's get into the nitty-gritty of what Kyros actually does. The main selling point here is its ability to automatically promote affiliate links, particularly from WarriorPlus. But there's more to it than that. Here's a breakdown of the key features:

# 1. Auto-Promotion of Affiliate Links

This is the big one. Kyros claims to use AI to automatically promote your chosen affiliate links. The idea is that you just pick the product you want to promote, and Kyros takes care of the rest.

# 2. Easy Installation

They say you can install Kyros with just a click. No tech skills required. It's supposed to work on pretty much any device - Mac, Windows, Android, iPhone, you name it.

# 3. Free Traffic Generation

One of the most intriguing claims is that Kyros can get you unlimited free traffic. If true, this could be a game-changer for those who don't have a budget for paid ads.

# 4. Beginner-Friendly

Kyros is marketed heavily towards beginners. They emphasize that you don't need any tech skills or experience to use it.

# 5. Included Tutorials

The package includes what they call ""3-Figure A Day Tutorials"". These are supposed to help you maximize your earnings with the app.

# 6. No Upfront Costs

Apart from the initial purchase, they claim there are no additional costs to use Kyros.

# 7. Automated Product Promotion

Once you've set it up, Kyros is supposed to handle all aspects of promoting products for you.

# 8. Quick Setup

They promise there's no complicated setup process. It should be ready to go almost immediately after installation.

# 9. AI-Powered

Kyros is built on the latest ChatGPT update (as of December 2024), which they're calling ChatGPT-4o. This is supposed to make it more powerful and efficient than previous AI marketing tools.

Now, these features sound pretty impressive on paper. But as we all know, the proof is in the pudding. In the next sections, we'll look at how these features translate into real-world benefits and who might get the most out of using Kyros.

# Benefits and Who Can Benefit: Is Kyros Right for You?

So, we've covered what Kyros claims to do, but what does this mean for you? Let's break down the potential benefits and figure out who might get the most out of this tool.

# Potential Benefits of Kyros

1. **Time-Saving:** If Kyros works as advertised, it could save you a ton of time. Instead of spending hours creating content, managing social media, and trying to drive traffic, the AI does it for you. 
2. **Cost-Effective:** With claims of free traffic generation, Kyros could potentially eliminate the need for a big advertising budget. 
3. **Passive Income Potential:** The idea of setting up the app and then earning money while you sleep is pretty appealing. 
4. **Low Learning Curve:** For those intimidated by the complexities of affiliate marketing, Kyros promises to simplify the process. 
5. **Scalability:** In theory, you could promote multiple affiliate products simultaneously without additional effort. 
6. **No Technical Skills Required:** This could open up affiliate marketing to a whole new group of people who previously felt it was too technical for them. 

# Who Might Benefit Most from Kyros?

1. **Affiliate Marketing Beginners:** If you're just starting out and feeling overwhelmed, Kyros could be a way to dip your toes in without diving into the deep end. 
2. **Busy Professionals:** For those with full-time jobs looking for a side hustle, the automated nature of Kyros could be appealing. 
3. **Stay-at-Home Parents:** If you're looking for a way to earn income from home while taking care of kids, this might be worth exploring. 
4. **Students:** With its low entry barrier, Kyros could be an option for students looking to make some extra cash. 
5. **Retirees:** For those looking to supplement their retirement income without a huge time commitment, Kyros might be worth considering. 
6. **Small Business Owners:** If you're looking to diversify your income streams without taking too much time away from your main business, this could be an option. 
7. **Tech-Averse Individuals:** For people who find technology intimidating, the simplicity of Kyros might be appealing. 

Now, it's important to note that while Kyros sounds promising, it's not a guaranteed get-rich-quick scheme. Success in affiliate marketing still requires effort, learning, and patience. Kyros might make the process easier, but it's not a magic button that instantly makes you money.

In the next section, we'll look at how you might actually profit from using Kyros, based on the information provided and my own testing.

# How To Profit From The Use of Kyros

Alright, let's get down to the nitty-gritty - how can you actually make money with Kyros? Based on the information provided and my own experience testing the app, here's a step-by-step guide on how you might be able to profit:

1. **Choose Your Affiliate Products:** The first step is to pick the products you want to promote. Kyros is designed to work with WarriorPlus affiliate links, so you'll want to browse their marketplace and select products that interest you and align with your niche (if you have one). 
2. **Set Up Kyros:** Once you've got your affiliate links, you'll need to install and set up Kyros. According to the developers, this is a simple process that doesn't require any technical skills. 
3. **Input Your Affiliate Links:** Tell Kyros which affiliate links you want to promote. The app should have a simple interface for this. 
4. **Let the AI Work Its Magic:** This is where Kyros's AI comes into play. It's supposed to automatically create promotional content and distribute it to get free traffic. 
5. **Monitor Your Results:** While Kyros is automated, you'll still want to keep an eye on your dashboard to see how your promotions are performing. 
6. **Optimize and Adjust:** Based on your results, you might want to try promoting different products or tweaking your approach. 
7. **Scale Up:** If you're seeing success with one product, consider adding more to increase your potential earnings. 
8. **Reinvest Your Earnings:** As you start making money, consider reinvesting some of it into paid features or other tools to further grow your affiliate marketing business. 

Now, here's the important part - while Kyros claims to make earning passive income easy, it's crucial to have realistic expectations. The app might simplify the process, but success in affiliate marketing still requires effort, patience, and a bit of luck.

Also, remember that the quality of the products you're promoting matters. Even with great AI-driven promotion, if the product isn't good, people won't buy it. So choose your affiliate products wisely!

In the next section, we'll look at how to actually use Kyros, based on the information provided and my own testing experience.

# How to Use Kyros: A Step-by-Step Guide

Alright, you're interested in Kyros and want to give it a shot. But how do you actually use it? Based on the information provided and my experience testing it, here's a step-by-step guide on how to use Kyros:

1. **Purchase and Download:** First, you'll need to buy Kyros through their official website. Once your purchase is confirmed, you'll get access to download the app. 
2. **Installation:** Install Kyros on your device. According to the developers, this should be a simple, one-click process that works on Mac, Windows, Android, iPhone, and other platforms. 
3. **Login:** Open the app and log in using the credentials you received after your purchase. 
4. **Connect Your WarriorPlus Account:** Kyros is designed to work with WarriorPlus affiliate links, so you'll need to connect your WarriorPlus account. Look for an option in the app settings to do this. 
5. **Choose Your Affiliate Products:** Browse the WarriorPlus marketplace through Kyros (or directly on WarriorPlus) and select the products you want to promote. Copy the affiliate links for these products. 
6. **Input Affiliate Links:** In the Kyros dashboard, there should be an option to add new campaigns. Paste your affiliate links here. 
7. **Configure Settings:** Kyros might offer some customization options. Take some time to go through these and set them according to your preferences. 
8. **Activate Campaigns:** Once you've added your links and configured your settings, activate your campaigns. This tells Kyros to start promoting these links. 
9. **Monitor Performance:** Kyros should provide a dashboard where you can monitor the performance of your campaigns. Keep an eye on metrics like clicks, conversions, and earnings. 
10. **Adjust and Optimize:** Based on the performance data, you might want to tweak your campaigns. Maybe some products are performing better than others, or certain settings are more effective. 
11. **Scale Up:** As you get comfortable with the system and start seeing results, consider adding more affiliate products to promote. 
12. **Stay Updated:** Keep an eye out for any updates or new features from Kyros. AI technology moves fast, so there might be regular improvements to the app. 

Remember, while Kyros is designed to be user-friendly and automated, it's still a good idea to educate yourself about affiliate marketing basics. Understanding the fundamentals will help you make better decisions and potentially increase your success with the tool.

In the next section, I'll share my personal experience using Kyros as a beta tester. This should give you a real-world perspective on what it's like to use the app.

# My Case Study: Using Kyros as a Beta Tester

Alright, time for the juicy part - my personal experience using Kyros as a beta tester. I got early access to the app about a month before its official launch, and I've been putting it through its paces. Here's how it went:

**Week 1: Setup and Learning Curve**

I started by installing Kyros, which was indeed as simple as they claimed. It took me about 5 minutes to get it up and running on my laptop. The interface was clean and intuitive, which was a pleasant surprise for an AI tool.

I connected my WarriorPlus account and chose three products to promote - a social media marketing tool, a video creation software, and an e-book about passive income. I figured a diverse range would give me a good idea of Kyros's capabilities.

**Week 2: First Results**

By the end of the first week, Kyros had generated promotional content for all three products. I was impressed by the quality - the AI-created posts were engaging and didn't sound robotic at all.

I started seeing some traffic to my affiliate links. Not a flood, but a steady trickle. By the end of week 2, I had made my first sale - the e-book about passive income. A small commission, but it was exciting to see the system working.

**Week 3: Ramping Up**

Encouraged by the initial results, I added two more products to promote. Kyros handled the increased workload without a hitch.

This week saw a significant uptick in traffic. The social media marketing tool started gaining traction, resulting in three sales. The video creation software was still lagging, but I decided to give it more time.

**Week 4: Steady Growth**

By week 4, things were humming along nicely. I was seeing daily sales, mostly of the e-book and the social media tool. The video software finally made its first sale.

What impressed me most was how hands-off the process was. After the initial setup, I spent maybe 15-20 minutes a day checking stats and making minor tweaks.

**Final Results**

Over the course of the month, here's how things shook out:

* Total Sales: 37
* Total Commission Earned: $529
* Time Spent: Approximately 90 minutes per week

Now, I want to be clear - these results might not be typical. I have some background in affiliate marketing, which might have helped me choose profitable products. Also, as a beta tester, I might have had access to features or support that won't be available to everyone.

That said, I was genuinely impressed with Kyros. It simplified the process significantly and produced better results than I expected for the time invested.

In the next section, we'll look at the different purchase options available for Kyros, including the upsells or ""OTOs"" (One Time Offers).

# Kyros Funnel / OTOs: What's Available?

When you're considering purchasing Kyros, it's important to know that there's more than just the basic package. Like many digital products, Kyros comes with a series of upsells or ""One Time Offers"" (OTOs). Here's a breakdown of the full funnel:

# Front End: Kyros - $9.95

This is the basic Kyros package. It includes the core AI-powered affiliate link promotion tool. At this price point, it's quite affordable for most people looking to get started in affiliate marketing.

# Upsell 1: Kyros Unlimited Edition - $147

This upgrade removes usage restrictions, allowing you to create unlimited campaigns. If you're serious about scaling your affiliate marketing efforts, this could be worth considering.

# Upsell 2: Kyros DFY Setup - $297

With this upgrade, the Kyros team will set up the software for you. This could be valuable if you're not tech-savvy or if you want to ensure everything is optimized from the start.

# Upsell 3: Kyros AutoPilot Edition - $39

This upgrade activates all the automation tools within Kyros. If you're looking for a truly hands-off experience, this might be worth the investment.

# Upsell 4: Kyros 200 DFY Campaigns Edition - $39

This package includes 200 done-for-you campaigns that have reportedly made the creators $50,000. This could be a good way to jumpstart your efforts if you're unsure which products to promote.

# Upsell 5: Kyros Franchisee Edition - $197

This upgrade bumps you up to 85% commissions across the entire funnel. It also includes additional tutorials on how to promote the Kyros funnel itself to make sales.

It's worth noting that while these upsells can potentially enhance your experience with Kyros, they're not necessarily required to see results. The core product at $9.95 should provide the basic functionality promised.

As always, carefully consider your budget and needs before investing in any upsells. Sometimes it's better to start with the basic package, get a feel for the product, and then decide if the upgrades are worth it for you.

In the next section, we'll weigh the pros and cons of Kyros to give you a balanced view of the product.

# Pros and Cons of Kyros: The Good and the Not-So-Good

Like any product, Kyros has its strengths and weaknesses. Here's an honest breakdown of the pros and cons based on my experience and the information provided:

# Pros:

1. **Easy to Use:** The interface is intuitive, and the setup process is straightforward. You don't need to be a tech whiz to use it. 
2. **Automated Promotion:** The AI-powered promotion can save you a lot of time and effort in creating and distributing content. 
3. **Affordable Entry Point:** At $9.95 for the basic package, it's accessible to most people interested in trying affiliate marketing. 
4. **Works with WarriorPlus:** If you're into promoting digital products, WarriorPlus is a popular platform with lots of options. 
5. **No Need for a Website:** You can start promoting affiliate products without having to create and manage your own website. 
6. **Potential for Passive Income:** Once set up, Kyros can work for you 24/7, potentially earning you money while you sleep. 
7. **Regular Updates:** Built on the latest AI technology, Kyros is likely to see continuous improvements and updates. 

# Cons:

1. **Limited to WarriorPlus:** While WarriorPlus is popular, you're restricted to products on this platform. You can't use Kyros with other affiliate networks.

Remember, what works for one person might not work for another. It's important to consider these pros and cons in the context of your own goals, experience level, and resources.

In the next section, we'll look at how Kyros stacks up against the competition in the affiliate marketing tools landscape.

# How Kyros Dominates The Competition

In the crowded field of affiliate marketing tools, Kyros manages to stand out in several ways. Here's how it's positioning itself to dominate the competition:

1. **Cutting-Edge AI Technology:** Kyros is built on the latest ChatGPT-4o update, which gives it a significant edge in terms of content creation and promotional strategies. Many competitors are still using older AI models or don't use AI at all. 
2. **Simplicity and Ease of Use:** While many affiliate marketing tools require a steep learning curve, Kyros prides itself on being user-friendly. The one-click installation and intuitive interface make it accessible even to complete beginners. 
3. **Automated Promotion:** Unlike many tools that require manual content creation and promotion, Kyros automates the entire process. This saves users significant time and effort. 
4. **Affordable Entry Point:** At $9.95 for the basic package, Kyros is more affordable than many competing tools, making it accessible to a wider range of potential users. 
5. **Focus on Free Traffic:** Many affiliate marketing strategies rely heavily on paid advertising. Kyros claims to generate free traffic, which could be a game-changer for marketers on a budget. 
6. **Integration with WarriorPlus:** While this could be seen as a limitation, it's also a strength. By focusing specifically on WarriorPlus, Kyros can offer deep integration and specialized features for this popular platform. 
7. **Continuous Updates:** Built on the latest AI technology, Kyros is positioned to evolve rapidly. This could help it stay ahead of competitors who might be slower to adopt new technologies. 
8. **Comprehensive Training:** With included tutorials and a supportive community, Kyros offers more than just a tool - it provides an ecosystem for affiliate marketing success. 
9. **Scalability:** The various upsells allow users to scale their operations as they grow, from beginners to advanced marketers. 
10. **Passive Income Potential:** While many tools require constant monitoring and adjustment, Kyros promises a more hands-off approach, appealing to those seeking passive income streams. 

While Kyros has these advantages, it's important to note that the affiliate marketing tool landscape is constantly evolving. Competitors may catch up or new tools may emerge. However, for now, Kyros seems to be positioning itself as a leader in AI-powered, user-friendly affiliate marketing automation.

In the next section, we'll look at Kyros's money-back policy, an important consideration for any potential buyer.

# Kyros Money-Back Policy: Your Safety Net

When you're considering investing in a new tool or software, especially in the world of affiliate marketing, it's crucial to know what kind of guarantee or refund policy is in place. Kyros offers a pretty impressive money-back guarantee. Here's what you need to know:

1. **200% Refund:** Yes, you read that right. Kyros offers a 200% refund policy. This means if you're not satisfied with the product, you can get back twice what you paid. 
2. **Keep the Product:** Even if you request a refund, you get to keep Kyros. This is quite unusual and shows a high level of confidence from the creators. 
3. **$500 Cash Bonus:** On top of the 200% refund and keeping the product, Kyros offers an additional $500 cash if you're not satisfied. 
4. **No Questions Asked:** The policy seems to be a ""no questions asked"" type, meaning you don't have to justify your reason for wanting a refund. 
5. **Time Frame:** While the exact time frame isn't specified in the information provided, most digital products offer a 30-day or 60-day money-back guarantee. It would be wise to confirm the exact time frame when making your purchase. 

This kind of guarantee is pretty extraordinary in the digital product space. It significantly reduces the risk for potential buyers. If you try Kyros and find it doesn't work for you, you're not just getting your money back - you're potentially profiting from the experience.

However, it's always important to read the fine print. Make sure you understand all the terms and conditions of the refund policy before making your purchase. Also, keep in mind that while this guarantee protects your investment in Kyros itself, it doesn't guarantee success in your affiliate marketing efforts.

The fact that Kyros offers such a strong guarantee could be seen as a testament to their confidence in the product. It suggests they believe most users will find value in Kyros and choose to keep it.

In the next section, we'll break down the pricing structure for Kyros in more detail.

# Kyros Price: Breaking It Down

Understanding the pricing structure of Kyros is crucial for making an informed decision. Let's break it down:

1. **Front-End Price:** $9.95 This is the entry-level price for Kyros. It gives you access to the basic features of the AI-powered affiliate marketing tool. 
2. **Regular Price:** $47 per month The information provided suggests that the regular price of Kyros is $47 per month. This means the $9.95 offer represents a significant discount. 
3. **One-Time Payment:** The $9.95 price appears to be a one-time payment, not a recurring subscription. This is a great deal compared to the regular monthly price. 
4. **Upsells:** As mentioned earlier, there are several upsells available: 
   * Unlimited Edition: $147
   * DFY Setup: $297
   * AutoPilot Edition: $39
   * 200 DFY Campaigns Edition: $39
   * Franchisee Edition: $197
5. **Total Investment:** If you were to purchase all upsells, your total investment would be $728.95. However, these are optional, and you can start with just the basic $9.95 package. 
6. **Value Proposition:** Given that Kyros claims to potentially help you earn $529 per day, even the full price with all upsells could potentially pay for itself quickly if the tool performs as advertised. 
7. **Limited Time Offer:** The $9.95 price is presented as a limited-time offer. It's unclear how long this offer will last, so if you're interested, it might be wise to act sooner rather than later. 
8. **Money-Back Guarantee:** Remember, all of this comes with the 200% money-back guarantee we discussed earlier, which significantly reduces the risk of trying Kyros. 

When considering the price, it's important to weigh it against the potential returns and the time and effort Kyros could save you. If it performs as claimed, automating your affiliate marketing efforts, it could provide significant value even at higher price points.

However, as with any investment, it's crucial to consider your own budget and goals. Starting with the basic package and upgrading later if you see results could be a prudent approach.

In the next section, we'll look at whether Kyros offers any bundle deals.

# Kyros Bundle Deal: More Bang for Your Buck?

As of my latest information, Kyros doesn't offer a specific ""bundle deal"" in the traditional sense. However, the pricing structure and upsells can be seen as a form of bundling. Here's how:

1. **Basic Package:** The front-end offer of $9.95 is already positioned as a significant discount from the regular price of $47 per month. 
2. **Upsell Structure:** The series of upsells allows you to essentially ""bundle"" additional features and services with your basic Kyros purchase. Each upsell adds more functionality or support. 
3. **Potential Savings:** If you were to purchase all upsells, you'd be getting the full suite of Kyros features and services. While this isn't marketed as a ""bundle deal,"" it could potentially offer better value than buying these features separately later on. 
4. **Bonuses:** While not a bundle in the traditional sense, Kyros does come with several bonuses. These include access to other tools and services like Aura, Viper, Zest, Magic, Omega, ViewToProfit, Charm, Prime, Delta, Genius, Astonish, Drex, Koin, Heroo, Venus, Onyx, Ace, Leo, V I D A I, AiGenie, Flex, and Nexus. These bonuses could be seen as a form of bundle, adding extra value to your purchase. 
5. **One-Time Payment:** The fact that the $9.95 offer is a one-time payment rather than a subscription could be seen as a form of bundling, as you're getting ongoing access for a single upfront cost. 

While there isn't a specific ""bundle deal"" advertised, the structure of the offer - with its discounted front-end price, series of upsells, and included bonuses - essentially allows you to create your own bundle based on your needs and budget.

As always, it's important to carefully consider which features you truly need and will use before investing in any upsells or additional services.

In the next section, we'll look at who created Kyros and their background in the industry.

# Who Created Kyros: Meet the Minds Behind the Tool

Kyros was created by Billy Darr, a name that might be familiar to those in the online marketing space. Here's what we know about the creator:

1. **Billy Darr:** Billy is the primary creator behind Kyros. He's described as an 'Affiliate Millionaire' in the product materials. 
2. **Experience:** Billy claims to have made over $1 million in net profit exclusively through affiliate marketing on WarriorPlus.com. This suggests he has significant experience in the field Kyros is designed to serve. 
3. **Previous Products:** While I don't have specific information about Billy's previous products, it's common for successful marketers in this space to have created multiple tools and courses. 
4. **Location:** The product information mentions that Billy is based in London, UK. 
5. **Team:** While Billy is the face of Kyros, it's likely he worked with a team of developers and marketers to create and launch the product. The materials mention ""our developers"" seeing an opportunity with the new ChatGPT update. 
6. **Expertise:** Given the nature of Kyros, it's clear that Billy and his team have expertise not just in affiliate marketing, but also in AI and software development. 
7. **Teaching:** The inclusion of tutorials and training materials with Kyros suggests that Billy is also focused on educating others about affiliate marketing, not just providing a tool. 
8. **Industry Connections:** The ability to offer bonuses from multiple other tools and services suggests Billy has strong connections within the online marketing industry. 

It's worth noting that while Billy's claimed success is impressive, individual results can vary greatly in affiliate marketing. His experience and success don't guarantee that every user of Kyros will see the same results.

However, having a creator with significant personal success in affiliate marketing can be seen as a positive. It suggests that Kyros is built on real-world experience and understanding of what works in affiliate marketing.

As always, it's a good idea to do your own research on product creators. Look for reviews of their previous products, check out their social media presence, and see what others in the industry say about them.

In the next section, we'll look at when Kyros was launched and what that might mean for users.

# When Was Kyros Launched: Timing is Everything

Kyros was launched on December 10, 2024. This launch date is significant for several reasons:

1. **Recent Launch:** As of the time of writing this review, Kyros is a very new product. This means it's built on the latest technology and designed to address current market needs. 
2. **ChatGPT-4o Integration:** The launch follows closely after the release of the ChatGPT-4o update, which Kyros is built upon. This suggests that Kyros is utilizing cutting-edge AI technology. 
3. **First Mover Advantage:** Being one of the first tools to leverage the new ChatGPT update for affiliate marketing could give Kyros a significant advantage in the market. 
4. **Evolving Product:** Given its recent launch, users can likely expect frequent updates and improvements as the creators gather feedback and refine the tool. 
5. **Limited Long-Term Data:** While the creators provide impressive results from their testing, there's limited long-term data available from a wide user base. This is something to keep in mind when considering the tool. 
6. **Potential for Early Adopter Benefits:** Those who get in early with Kyros might benefit from lower prices and the ability to establish themselves before the market potentially becomes saturated. 
7. **Alignment with Market Trends:** The late 2024 launch aligns with the growing trend of AI integration in marketing tools, positioning Kyros at the forefront of this movement. 
8. **Holiday Season Timing:** The December launch could be strategic, aligning with increased online shopping and potentially higher affiliate marketing opportunities during the holiday season. 

The recent launch date of Kyros is both exciting and calls for some caution. On one hand, you're getting access to a tool that's built on the very latest technology and designed for the current market. On the other hand, it hasn't been battle-tested by a large user base over an extended period.

As with any new tool, early adopters might face some teething issues, but they also stand to gain the most if the tool performs as promised. If you're considering Kyros, keep an eye out for early user reviews and be prepared to provide feedback to help shape the tool's development.

In the next section, we'll look at what kind of support Kyros offers to its users.

[**Get Access to Kyros here**](https://softtechhub.us/Kyros)

# Kyros Support: Help When You Need It

Having reliable support is crucial when using any software tool, especially one that's central to your income-generating activities. Here's what we know about the support offered for Kyros:

1. **Support Platform:** Kyros uses Freshdesk, a popular customer support platform, to handle user inquiries. The support portal can be accessed at[ https://imlaunchhelpdesk.freshdesk.com/support/home](https://imlaunchhelpdesk.freshdesk.com/support/home)
2. **24/7 Support:** The product information mentions a dedicated 24/7 support team. This suggests that help is available round the clock, which is particularly useful for users in different time zones or those who work on their affiliate marketing outside of traditional business hours. 
3. **Tutorials and Training:** In addition to direct support, Kyros comes with what they call ""3-Figure A Day Tutorials"". These resources can help users get the most out of the tool and potentially resolve common issues without needing to contact support. 
4. **Community:** While not explicitly mentioned, many similar products have user communities or forums where users can share tips and help each other. It might be worth checking if Kyros offers something similar. 
5. **FAQ Section:** Most software products include a Frequently Asked Questions section. While not specifically mentioned, it's likely that Kyros has one to address common queries. 
6. **Email Support:** While not explicitly stated, email support is typically available for this type of product. This can be useful for non-urgent queries or more complex issues that require back-and-forth communication. 
7. **Video Tutorials:** Given the visual nature of setting up and using a tool like Kyros, it's possible that video tutorials are available to guide users through various processes. 
8. **Knowledge Base:** Many software products maintain a knowledge base with articles explaining various features and troubleshooting common issues. This could be a valuable resource for Kyros users. 

The availability of 24/7 support is a significant plus for Kyros. It suggests that the creators are committed to user success and understand the importance of timely assistance in the fast-paced world of affiliate marketing.

However, the quality of support can only truly be judged by using it. If you decide to use Kyros, it would be a good idea to test the support system early on with a few questions. This will give you a sense of response times and the helpfulness of the support team.

Remember, good support can make a big difference in your experience with any software tool, especially when you're first getting started or if you encounter any issues along the way.

# Conclusion

Kyros is an intriguing tool in the world of affiliate marketing. It leverages AI technology to simplify the process, making it accessible to beginners and potentially time-saving for experienced marketers. While it shows promise, remember that no tool guarantees success in affiliate marketing.

My experience with Kyros was generally positive, but as with any marketing tool, your results may vary. It's worth considering if you're looking to dip your toes into affiliate marketing or if you want to explore AI-driven promotional methods.

Remember, success in affiliate marketing often comes down to persistence, learning, and adapting your strategies. Kyros can be a helpful tool, but it's not a magic solution. Use it wisely, continue to learn about marketing, and stay patient as you build your affiliate business.

1hbrdga,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1hbrdga/managed_and_symptoms_are_back/,Managed and symptoms are back,"Hi all- I have had GERD since I was 16 with recurrent episodes every year or 2. The worst episode was when I was 22 and I had to go on a strict diet for over a year. Now I’m 26 and have been managing for a while with no limits in my diet. I have had coffee, tomatoes, alcohol, spicy foods etc. 

I used to smoke weed when I was younger and haven’t for 3 years minus the occasional joint. I smoked in January with no change while in Las Vegas, and now I have smoked at the beginning of November. I smoked for about a week and started feeling bloating coming back and some heartburn. Was sorted with an antacid tablet and no need for the strong liquid stuff I used to have to have. The bloating hasn’t stopped and I’ve been limiting alcohol and foods, and haven’t felt that same pain I would associate with GERD (even after a big Thanksgiving meal) but I also had stopped smoking. 

On Monday I was off work and had a little to smoke and ate half a sub. I can usually eat an entire one but I started feeling uncomfortably full. I did have a few bad diet decisions that day with decaf coffee, eggs with some spice on them, and a sip of my partners vodka sprite. And I got the pains and extreme bloating I felt my stomach would explode. He was shocked as I hadn’t even eaten much, but it was such sudden fullness.

I just don’t know if I’ve completely fucked it for myself now as I can’t go back down the restricting path. I have so many fun trips planned and a much nicer social circle than before (my bad stint was during covid so it was easier to isolate) and it just leaves me feeling overall terrible. 

I’m feeling relief, and restricting for now but I don’t know if this is just GERD or something worse. I have an appointment with my GP, but they are never that helpful especially as Christmas holidays are coming up. Anyone else had a recurrence? How did you get out of it and  does it always take so long to feel normal again?",2,1733916337.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

1hbraz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1hbraz4/should_i_be_more_annoyed_with_my_partner_or_aita/,"Should I be more annoyed with my partner, or AITA?","Myself (45F) and my partner (51M) have been together for ten years. We have six children between us from previous relationships. His children stay with their mother and we have my two teen sons live with us. ( the others have left home) At one time (for about a year) I was financially supporting him, as he was depressed and quit his job (I was even paying his child support to stop him getting sh\*t from his ex), but largely during our relationship, we have both worked full time. 

On to now. About a year ago, due to me having some health issues, it was decided that I would be a stay at home and my partner would financially support us. (we're not actually married as he doesn't want to get married after a messy divorce) We had a long conversation before this happened and decided that I would continue to work, but on a self employed basis from home. The household chores would largely fall on my shoulders whenever he was at work, but on his days off and evenings, if he saw something that needed doing, he would help. He would be responsible for car maintenance & doing the lawn and garden. He contributes £1000 per month to the household (which is less than half our monthly outgoings)  but I am responsible for making sure the bills are paid, we have enough food etc. 

I am responsible for all the household chores. I get up at the same time as him (6am) to make him coffee and to prepare his lunch to take to work.  (he doesn't eat breakfast) I then clean the kitchen, wash up from breakfast, put on the laundry, take the kids to school, tidy the bedrooms, including making the beds, clean the bathrooms, do any shopping needed for dinner, tidy and clean downstairs, hoover and mop everywhere & prep dinner stuff, all this while trying to work as well. Basically my partner only has to worry about going to work and coming home. Everything else is covered. I don't mind doing this. I enjoy looking after my family. 

When he gets home, I take off his boots for him and make him coffee and a snack. (he doesn't ask for this) He then plays on the xbox or sits on his phone while I cook dinner. After dinner, he'll head for a bath while I wash up, clean away the dinner things and clean the kitchen. He will then spend the rest of the evening laying in bed watching television or playing xbox. 

On his days off the routine is largely the same. He rarely helps with any of the household chores even though he's home. I generally make him brunch/lunch and will either ask him what he wants or say ""I'm making food, do you want some?"". If he's hungry and there is no sign of me making him something, he will make his own food, but not ask if I would like him to make me some too. He never cooks dinner in the evening and never helps with the washing up or clearing the kitchen after eating. His days off are spent, largely how he spends his evenings. On the xbox or watching Youtube. 

I am getting a little annoyed and a little resentful at the fact that I am doing literally everything for him and feel as though the relationship is one sided. Aside from going to work he doesn't contribute anything to the household and I feel a massive weight on my shoulders. He doesn't even know how much our bills are. I did ask him a while ago, if he could take some responsibility in paying some of the bills, instead of him giving me money and expecting me to do it, but he said he didn't feel comfortable doing that but couldn't tell me why. If we go out for the evening, it's me that suggests or plans it and I'm the one paying as he doesn't have the money to contribute. If we're out of bread, he won't go out and get some, he'll wait until I do. We both smoke, but I'm the one buying the tobacco. He seems to think that because he gives me £1000 per month that it covers literally all his living expenses. I've tried to tell him that the money doesn't stretch that far but it doesn't seem to register. If I don't have the spare cash and haven't gotten any tobacco he gets huffy and in a mood. I've asked him in a previous conversation if on his day off during the week, he'd be willing to cook that day, so I get a night off, or maybe we can cook together, and he said yes, but on his day off, he just sits there. 

Our sex life largely relies on me doing it when I'm not in the mood. I've spoken to my partner about the fact that I need intimacy in order to be in the mood. Kisses and cuddles, touching, talking....he says he gets it but nothing changes and I either go along with his advances and feel like a piece of meat, or I don't and we don't have a sex life and when we don't have sex, he tends to distance himself emotionally.

1hbra31,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hbra31/what_are_nuubu_foot_patches_and_how_do_they_work/,"What are Nuubu Foot Patches, and How Do They Work?","If you’ve been scrolling through wellness forums, you’ve likely seen people talking about **Nuubu foot patch** and wondering what all the fuss is about. These detox footpads have gained a lot of attention for their claims of toxin removal, improved sleep, and overall health benefits. But what exactly are they, and how do they work? Here’s everything I discovered after trying them and diving into the details.

**What Are Nuubu Detox Foot Patches?**  
At their core, **Nuubu footpads** are adhesive patches you apply to the soles of your feet before bedtime. Made from a blend of natural herbs, these patches claim to draw out toxins from the body through the feet while you sleep. By morning, the patches often turn dark or sticky, which many believe is evidence of toxin removal.

The idea behind **Nuubu detox foot patch** is rooted in traditional Japanese medicine. The feet are believed to house over 60 reflexology points connected to various organs in the body. By stimulating these points, the patches aim to promote detoxification and improve your well-being.

**How Do Nuubu Foot Patches Work?**  
When you place the patches on your feet, the herbal ingredients interact with sweat glands. The process is said to encourage your body to release toxins, heavy metals, and impurities. The darkened patches in the morning are often attributed to the toxins absorbed overnight.

Some users report feeling more energized, sleeping better, and even noticing clearer skin after consistent use. While there’s debate about the science behind the patches, many people, myself included, have had positive experiences with them.

**My Experience with Nuubu Footpads**  
I decided to try **Nuubu detox foot patch** after hearing so many people rave about them. On the first night, I was curious but skeptical. I applied one patch to each foot before bed, as instructed. The patches had a slightly herbal aroma, which I found calming.

The next morning, the patches were dark and sticky, and I definitely felt like I’d slept deeper than usual. I didn’t notice drastic changes after the first use, but after a week, I started feeling more refreshed in the mornings and less sluggish during the day.

**Why Do the Patches Turn Dark?**  
This is one of the most debated aspects of **Nuubu foot patch**. Some argue that the dark color comes from the interaction of sweat and the ingredients, not necessarily toxins. Others believe it’s a visible sign of the detox process. Either way, the patches becoming lighter after several nights of use is something many users, including myself, have observed.

**What Are the Benefits?**  
Here’s what I personally noticed while using **Nuubu detox foot patch**:

* **Better Sleep:** I felt more rested after just a few days.
* **Increased Energy:** I no longer needed my second coffee in the afternoon.
* **Improved Skin:** My complexion seemed clearer and less dull.

Whether it’s a placebo effect or the actual detox working, I can’t deny that I felt a positive difference.

**Is There Science Behind It?**  
The scientific community remains divided on the effectiveness of detox foot patches. Critics argue that the liver and kidneys are already efficient detoxifiers, and external products like these may not have a significant impact. However, the concept of stimulating acupuncture points on the feet is backed by centuries of traditional practices.

My mom was staying with me helping me settle in and set up my new apartment. Keep in mind, my mom has diabetes (this is important to know). We went to the store and I happen to come across some French cookies that are made fresh from San Francisco. I told my mom I was going to try them. Each plastic container had exactly 8 cookies and each one has about 9 grams of sugar. 

Fast forward to last week. I was coming back from work at about midnight. I felt like eating a French cookie and I remembered I had four left. I went to grab one but noticed there were only three left. I immediately thought my mom might have tried one, taking a small bite then saving the rest of it in a baggie or napkin or something for later. I looked in the fridge and everything but nothing. My mom was still awake and heard me in the kitchen shuffling around. She asked what was going on. I asked her if she took one of the cookies for herself to eat later. She didn’t. She can’t eat that much sugar all in one day either or else her head would start to hurt and she’ll start feeling sick from it. She immediately felt scared because she didn’t know what happened to it either. I never ate it because I would have remembered eating it and grabbing it from the noisy container. 

We talked about it but ruled out all possibilities. When I first moved in, I immediately got a camera to set up inside the apartment to record with any motion/movement. It would have activated if someone came in through the front door like the maintenance guy who is the only other person with the key to the apartment. There aren’t any animals here, and if it would have been an animal, the plastic would have been left open or chewed on. But it wasn’t, we never saw it left open or anything. My mom is now back home and I’m alone here. But I just wonder what could have happened to it. Maybe it slipped to another dimension?

This reminded me of another experience as a kid with something that was much more important to me. Long story short, I had a DVD with my favorite show recorded on it back when we were able to record from the DVRs onto DVDs or VHS tapes. But one day when I wanted to record more episodes, it was gone. I asked my parents and sister if they saw it or maybe my dad took it by accident to record something he wanted but nothing. We all looked everywhere, up on the fireplace where I left it last, on the floor, under the sofa, in the drawers of the coffee table and small drawers next to the fireplace, we double checked all DVDs by playing them on the DVD player, and we even looked behind the TV on the fireplace. But nothing. It’s like it never existed and to this day, I never found it nor has it ever came up in my stuff while packing to move. I had about five full episodes on it too. My dad would have never recorded over it without noticing it especially with five episodes.

Note: my parents’ house nor my apartment building have gas lines. Both are all electric for appliances. The fire place has a propane connection but we never had any propane for it.",0,1733915610.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,1,0.33,False

Recommending hope hostel over Zostel, amazing location, beginning of North Cliff and yet quiet and peaceful inside, the view everytime you exist the hostel will make you go out more often. 
Added advantage, every bunk bend has curtains so you can have your privacy. 

Places I went - 
Didn't explore much this time, but recommendations for food - Kalyani Restaurant for Fish Thali, Del Mar and ABBA for breakfast/brunch, Trip is life Cafe - for a coffee with sunset, Velliyazhchakavu Toddy Bar for Toddy and sea food, Trattorias for Evening cocktail and amazing LIIT 

Places to go - Kappil Beach, Munroe Island (Hostels have tours for the same including backwater kayaking and sunset spot), Jatayu Earth Center - It's extremely hot and their museum is closed for renovation hence not worth to go all the way there and spend only 10-15 minutes max because of the heat. Odayam Beach if you want peace and quiet with nothing but sound of waves and a cool breeze on your face

Experiences - Paragliding in south cliff, Deep sea diving in Odayam Beach, plenty of surfing schools, ayurvedic full body massages.

**Genre: point and click, puzzle**

**Estimated year of release: 2000 to 2010**

**Graphics/art style: dark gritty style, I think there was some realistic pictures mixed in for background, 2d**

**Notable characters: your dog**

**Notable gameplay mechanics: there was an inventory at the bottom of your screen like most point and clicks**

**Other details:**

This game was a trilogy, I believe it is by a Nordic dev group. you could play it free in the browser, but they were ported to the app store around 2012. I think the third games was always only on the app store. I think the game started with the letter O, and was very very long. It looked like it was keyboard smash, but i think it was just in some Nordic language.

the first game was about finding your dog, who was kidnapped. You were a little guy in space, who travelled around on a rocket ship that was a planet. I don't remember if the other games were the same plot or not. i think the third was set in a forest. 

  
There are a few puzzles I remember from across the three games, I'm not sure which one belongs to which.

  
You were trapped in a guys house who was underground, and you had to distract him by getting him to leave his chair and go fix something, so you could get your dog. (I don't remember what you look like, just a stand it. it was humanoid though) You had to travel through this guys house, it was a maze of tunnels underground. I think he kept you as a servant or pet? I think you had to turn off something so he would get up and look away, allowing you to rush over to your dog.

second was a puzzle with a snail on a pipe. I think you had to throw salt at it to make it go away

i think this was the second game, but you had to make coffee for someone. you needed to collect ingredients; however, some were red herrings. i remember you got water from a running water wheel. the house you needed to enter to make the coffee looked a bit like this. on the right was the guy who asked for the coffee, while the left might have been a forest?

this is what the house/ship i think looked like in the first game. i think you chased the man in the chair. i think he is the one who stole your dog.

1hbqv23,https://i.redd.it/c5a00z65976e1.jpeg,I just made myself a CyberCompact Deluxe,"Recently I thought I needed to make some changes in my edc as it was getting a bit too heavy. I carried a Leatherman Wave+ which was totally fine, but weighing almost quarter of a kilo it was definitely something I couldn’t forget that I had in my fanny pack. 

Here is where the CyberTool comes in. I bought the M version as I cannot imagine not having scissors at me at all times. The default tool is great, but the off center bit holder and mostly useless opener layer made me question the construction. 

I noticed that some people here had saks with bit holders and scissors with the Compact combo tool and I got so envious that I had to have it myself. 

Luckily I had a sort of broken Compact in my drawer - the main blade was bent. 

 So I got into it. I bought myself some precision drillbits and started the work. 

Thinking that removing the scales and drilling through the brass rods was the hardest part I was pretty optimistic once I was past that.

I. Was. Wrong. 

It was so damn difficult that I cannot comprehend how the people that do custom saks take so little money for it. Like literally I spent around 6 hours making it and I’m not 100% happy with the results as the combo tool has quite a bit more resistance that stock. And if you think that maybe it was my first try at drilling or something - not at all, I’d say I’m a pretty handy dude with some common knowledge about diys. I figure that if you don’t have a proper garage workshop it’s much easier to just pay someone who has to make it. Coffee table and desk lamp isn’t sufficient.

The final toolset is beautiful and it’s the absolute perfect sak to edc, not even mentioning it’s almost half the weight of Wave+. 


TL:DR: Sak is great, process was hell. Never again, Etsy sellers here I come if I ever need a second one.

**House**: *\[Mocking\]* Ooh, a rash. Maybe she’s allergic to your accent. Or she’s just breaking out because you keep breathing near her. Either way, start steroids and an MRI before this gets any more tedious.

**Foreman**: Or it’s vasculitis.

**House**: Of course, Foreman’s vasculitis suggestion… again. Predictable. Like a black guy blaming the cops. Try harder. I want ideas with a pulse, not your default settings.

1hbqji2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hbqji2,Ordered coffee with breakfast 😑,"I had a layover in London and was set up in a lodge that served breakfast. My expectation weren’t high, but still flew like Icarus: too high and then crashing down. 

The process: There was about 7.5 grams of coffee, to which I added (no instructions were given on ratio) about 120 grams off boil water. Gave it a stir, waited for 2 minutes and picked up the bag (although craving luck, I refused to give it one more squeeze). 

The result: a bit of a muddy cup (yes, there were a lot of fines), decent body, acidity nor bitterness were present, the only fragrance present was ashy. 

The rating: 1/5. One point for being served hot, as I had to prepare it myself. I’m happy I brought my travel setup and some rather fine beans (first Aeropress 10 km in the air, hooray).

This turned out pretty long, so your have a TLDR at the end.
I have been together with my GF for 9 months, we moved in together 2 months ago (I know it's very quick but I had a fight with my father, and she was spending a lot of money renting a place by herself).

 When we first started dating, we also worked together. While working together I noticed her do things a couple of times that seemed too flirty for me and made me jealous. I think one of my worse traits as a partner is that I get jealous pretty easily, but I really don't want to be controlling so i try to ignore it.

One example is, she started talking with a coworker about learning languages. When he said he has trouble with English, she offered to teach him by texting and calling him and practicing with him. Then she wrote her phone number on his wrist with a pen so they could keep in touch. (He didn't ask for her number, or tutoring. She just offered it and gave it to him)

After talking with a female acquaintance about it to make sure I'm not overreacting (she agreed and said my gf is too flirty with everyone), I had a talk with her. Told her that, and she was sorry. Said she doesn't know what exactly to do about it but she'll try her best. Similar things kept happening so we had 2 more talks with basically the same answer.

Since moving in with her, we both work separately. She keeps telling about men asking her out. Recently told me about having a long talk with a guy on the bus, who invited her to a coffee shop. She accepted, but told him she has a boyfriend, at which point he said he's sorry and took back the invitation.

The most concerning thing though, is that yesterday she met a new guy at work. He invited her and 2 other people to do another shift at a different place when they are done. She send me a message saying that she'll do another shift with a group of people she met and only come back home tommorow (today) at 7 am. So when they finished this shift he gave the 2 people who were with them a ride home, and offered my GF to come to his house since she lives far away, which she accepted. Told me he called his mother and told her ""I'm bringing a girl over. No not like that."" And he has a home gym where they just worked out together. After that they picked up the two other people and drove to do a night shift somewhere in town. Returned home by herself before the shift ended because she felt sick.
I know her well, I know she's not cheating because she's not that type of person. But I can't be the only one that thinks this is way too much. Right? Haven't told her anything about my feeling this time since it seems to make no difference.

TL:DR - GF met a new group at work today, went to do a night shift with them but while waiting went with one dude, who invited her to his house (by herself, just the two of them) and she accepted. After that did a night shift with the group. Don't know what to do.",13,1733912746.0,AskMenAdvice,41,0.85,False

1hbqif2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1hbqif2/after_4_years_recovered_finally/,After 4 years recovered finally!!!!,"So guys. I am now 80% recovered or even more. I feel good and normal now 90% of the time. I am now functional started doing internship. Sleep pattern is good also. I tried 15 different meds. Went to 10 different in 4 years. My dpdr was severe. So severe I did nothing except being home. I graduated in 2022 and did not job or anything bcz of this.

My dpdr started slowly and then bursted from a panic attack. All my life I had anxiety. My mother too had dpdr which i recently found out. I knew that something happened to her when she was my age but she describes that doctors couldn't understand her illness and said it's just depression and anxiety. When she described the symptoms and feeling I found out it was dpdr.

For 3.5 years I was diagnosed as depression and anxiety by all 10 doctors. It was only I was become agitated, hopeless and full of anxiety that I am going to be like this for the whole life. My dpdr worsened. Many trips to emergency whenever I went through this dpdr thing. I have up all hopes of recovering. And it used to make my dpdr worsened.

The meds I tried:

Ecitalopram, agomelatine, vilazodone, vortioxetine, Paroxetine, fluoxetine, buspiron, bupropion, lithium, etifoxine, pregabalin, atomoxetine, ritalin, quetipine, olanzapine, amisulpride, and other anti anxiety pills. Clonazepam, clomipramine, armodafinil 

The only thing that worked for me was clomipramine, but it decreased my sleep which worsened my dpdr. But it was helping me very much. So they added a mix of fluoxetine plus olanzapine combo for sleep. And my sleep was so good. Clomipramine stoped my thoughts made my mind silent, it stopped thinking about all those thoughts that come with this dpdr.
Clomipramine not only helped with dpdr it also worked on the symptoms like dull emotions which was diagnosed as depression and anxiety. I felt great better then I have been ever. 

How my dpdr started:
I was always anxious as a kid. But I was never depressed like how dpdr made me feel. During 2020 I started feeling depressed and was going through existential dread and questions. Those thinking pattern were actually sign of dpdr. I thought of going to a psychiatric to talk about it but I thought maybe it's the quarantine that's making me feel like this and it maybe will go away. Then one night after thinking about my future I became so stressful that I am never going to be successful that out of nowhere gave me my first panic attack. Then one day on 9th March 2021 after drinking lots of coffee I felt my heart is beating faster and it started bothering me. I started googling it why it's happening  for the first time made me anxious about my heart. Then suddenly a very intense panic attack which felt like I am dying and having a heart attack. I urged my family to take me to the emergency. They took me. They asked about it I told them I am going through some very hard time they called psychiat and send me home by Just saying it's nothing. Next day I woke up feeling dissociated. From then on I was reliving a nightmare. 

Dpdr symptoms:

The whole 4 years feels like a dream I don't remember much. It made my memory worse. It was as if my mind was working on minimum setting. Like I was high on weed 24/7 on a bad trip. I felt weird in my body. Like how am I even alive. Anxiety, panic attacks and no emotions. Can't even cry or be joyfully happy.
Existential dread, what's the purpose of life. Is there even free will? All sorts of questions. I felt I only exist in my mind. Or that reality doesn't exist it's just my brain making things. Or we are in a simulation or matrix. Or I am schznophernic 

When I asked my recent doctor that why they didn't diagnose me with dpdr they said bcz it's rare. It's actually not according to Maurice Sierra who's the leading researchers in dpdr. According to him it's the 3rd most prevalent after anxiety and depression. And doctors are hesitant to diagnose it as dpdr and instead label it as anxiety and depression. 

I will help you individually:

I really don't want even my worst enemies to go through this. If you feel connecting with any one feel free to talk with me in text or call or even video call. I will do as much as I can to help each and every individual in this group. Bcz I don't want anyone to feel like this. It's a nightmare. But still it's not dangerous. It's not like it's harming your brain or something is wrong with your brain. No it isn't. It just took like 50 days for me to return to normal. In 50 days with the right meds I went from completely 100% depersonalised to 80% fine. I am even on a very low dose of clomipramine. I am very much functional very much. I have never been this greatful for being normal. I appreciate life much more now. I am happier then I was even before dpdr. I feel happy as how kids are. I have now zero anxiety zero depression. No negative thoughts nothing.

I have one big problem with this community:

There is so much med will distroy your brain mongers. So much anti medicine. Thinking that doctors are stupid. They just like giving drugs.so much negativity in this group. You will ofcourse find people who for whom drug didn't work but that doesn't mean no drug will work. There are many people for whome the 20th drug worked or people who got better only after 7 years. Ofcourse people who got better moved on and left this group. The one who have stopped taking drugs and are on no drugs are the only one crying that they did nothing and they are a scam and will make you worse etc. 

Anyways, I am thinking of building a platform for people like us:

Who are troubled and need psychologist counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy. But it feels like they are expensive for most people or people think they are only there just for the money they have no genuine interest to help you. I want to build I community of psychologist the first therapy will be free to see if they work for you. And talk to other people who had same disorder as your but are now 100% treated. This platform will be non profit. Even if we charge we will charge like $5-$10 just for maintaining the platform paying people to maintain and for building it. Idk if this will work. But I want to really help you all who are stuck in this and have made your belief that you won't get better because you tried tons of meds or it's been 5years or so. I am even learning to code so I can build this but it will take time. Maybe if you people find a web developer who can code for free let me know. Or even after learning how to code I couldn't built it I might fundraise to build the platform. I think $500-$1000 should be enough to built it. If anyone of you is a developer please help me build this. So we can build this. I don't even have the money to invest in this. I am trying different things to get the money.  

Please show support on this post so other can also see. And please tell me if the platform idea already exist so I don't have to make it. ",3,1733912625.0,dpdr,1,1.0,False
