1g5xbfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/1g5xbfc/derma_roller_and_stretch_marks/,Derma Roller and Stretch Marks ,"Hi guys, so I'm currently struggling with stretch marks on my lower stomach, bikini line, slightly on my hips and thighs. I noticed them very quickly as I felt they appeared practically overnight. I've order bio-oil and used the whole bottle for about a month and didn't seem to see an results so I switched to the Paula's Choice Skin-Smoothing Retinol treatment because I've also heard good reviews of it (this i am currently using). I noticed the stretch marks around August so it's been about three months now. Has anyone had success with derma rolling or even coffee scrubs I've been seeing them suggested. I'm 20 F and feel so stressed and insecure whenever I wear any shorts and can't even think about having to wear a bathing suit at the beach. Can anyone make recommendations on what dermaroller they used and how often to use it? Really any suggestions to helping stretch marks will be appreciated, Thanks!",1,1729188504.0,beauty,0,1.0,False

What should I do next?,"I (23F) and my bf (23M)have been dating for about 3 months and have known each other for more than 3 years. We share similar hobbies, similar plans and he and I both care or know about topics that we can discuss with each other at length. We are still early in the early stage of our relationship but we have not have any arguments so far.


Recently, I have noticed certain things about him that tick me off. He never offer to help me with my stuffs even when I am struggling to hold them or to at least keep the door open for me while I do so. I got doors slammed into me and my things several times because of this already. When the elevators are crowded, if he can shove himself in, he would not wait for me so I would be waiting alone to catch another elevator. If he is holding the umbrella and it‚Äôs raining, I would always get wet because he would tilt the umbrella toward him a little too much. When we are going out for coffee and the baristas call us to take the drinks, he only takes his drinks to bring back to the table, not even offer to bring mine back for me.


It feels stupid to type all this out because these things are so trivial but it frustrates me. The same things that he never does are easily done by my friends, coworkers of both genders. I would never have to even ask and they would help me like the most normal things in the world. The problem is that I really don‚Äôt think that he is doing all that intentionally and is just being oblivious.


I know that relationships require communication to survive and I intended to talk to him about it but my friend, who is furious on behalf of me, believes that these things shouldn‚Äôt even need to require a discussion. She said that anyone with a bit of human decency would have known without being told outright. I understand what she meant after our talk but I still hesitate. I need someone with an unbiased point of view to give me some insight because for all that I love my friend, she can be overprotective sometimes.

I've recently noticed that Jake is into me. But I think it might be too late. He's really nice, polite, considerate but I'm just not into him.

The thing is, as I started to consider him a friend, I didn't want him to feel like I was only taking the food and drinks he gave me without any appreciation, so I began to make him coffee and take it from home. This didn't happen EVERY day, of course. But quite frequently. I think that's where I messed up. Maybe that's what made him think I like him?
I don't know! But I do know that I'm stuck. I'm going to keep working with him and he's too nice and a gentleman, I don't want to hurt his feelings but I also don't find him attractive so I don't want to lead him on.

----

> *""I can do hard things."" ‚ÄîMs. Rachel* 

Around 1pm on December 2, the messages started to roll in:

>""Yeah brother!!!! Hardrock!!!!""

>""Waitlist for Hardrock! Yeah brother!! Hope you get in!!""

>""7!!!!""

I had been selected seventh in the Men's Never waitlist for the Hardrock 100 Endurance Run. THE Hardrock. The big granddaddy of US mountain runs. My singular running goal for almost a decade. I had heard about Hardrock back when I started running in 2012, worked my way up to finishing a qualifying race in 2016, and started applying for the lottery immediately. I had been ""lucky"" to get selected so quickly.

Seventh was an exciting but awkward spot on the waitlist. Low enough that I wasn't guaranteed to get into the run, but high enough that I would have to train. Hard.

Like the name suggests, Hardrock is one of the most difficult 100 milers in the world. Starting in the old mining town of Silverton, the course makes a single massive loop through the heart of Colorado's rugged San Juan Mountains, crossing multiple 13,000 foot passes and summitting a 14er. The average elevation is over 11,000 feet. The run is an homage to the hard rock miners who built many of the trails and jeep roads to extract precious metals from these brutal, gorgeous mountains.

##**Training**

(This section is unlikely to be interesting to most people. You should probably skip it. The actual race report is down below.)

My training volume has been hit and miss over the years, but I was determined not to show up to Silverton unprepared. The only minor, teensy complication was that, for the first time in my life I would be balancing 100 miler training with fatherhood. Yes, it turns out that my first official race after the birth of my daughter Emily would also be the most personally meaningful race I had ever run. No pressure!

Okay, there was a secondary complication if I'm being honest: How do you train for a race that you might not actually run? The answer to that ended up being straightforward. I would simply gaslight myself into believing that it was a 100 percent guarantee. And if I ended up not running it, I could deal with the emotional fallout later. What could go wrong?

As for the actual nuts and bolts of training, I no longer had the time for 8-10 hour meandering long runs every Saturday. I needed to be strategic. The first order of business was to lose some of my ""dad bod"" weight, which meant cutting out my morning bagel and evening beer(s) during the week. I dropped from 175ish pounds to about 160 before race day.

I also adopted the unholy trinity of aging ultrarunners: stretching, strength training, and cross training. I despise every one of those things, but I could feel the benefits almost immediately in my runs, so I stuck with it. My hip bursitis, IT band pain, sciatica, and various other old-person ailments gradually improved even as I ramped up my mileage. I suppose I should have started doing all of this stuff years ago.

Instead of making the long drive to the Catskills, Adirondacks, or Whites to find sustained climbs on the weekends, I spent my lunch breaks on an incline treadmill set to 20%, knocking out 3,000-5,000 foot workouts while watching Hardrock videos on YouTube. Saturday's long runs generally started around 4 or 5am so I could be back at home for Emily's breakfast. Occasionally I would run a second time during her morning nap or in the evening when she went to bed. I did manage to sneak away for my annual Everesting attempt in March and a Cactus to Clouds run in May, which both gave me confidence in my training.

My peak weeks were a respectable 60mi/20k', 61mi/20k', 46mi/20k'. By the time we got to Colorado, I had logged 350,000 feet of cumulative elevation gain in the past six months.

Now I just had to get into the dang thing.

##**The moment of truth... or is it?**

We landed in Denver still not knowing whether I was going to run Hardrock or not. I had gradually moved up to first on the waitlist, but time was running out. Flights, hotels, and a sprinter van had all been booked months in advance, and my crew/pacer dream team had made plans to travel out too. We collectively held our breaths waiting for some movement on the list.

In the meantime, Alex, Em, and I had some vacationing to do. My top priority was to get Emily to the summit of a 14er. I was halfway up Quandary Peak with a sleeping baby on my back when Alex stopped to answer a work email. I figured I'd take my phone off airplane mode to check my emails too, only to see a voicemail from an unknown number.

>Voicemail: Hi Ryan. Dale Garland, Hardrock Endurance Run. When you get this message, if you would, please give me a call. Thanks!  
>Alex: Call him back! Call him back right now!!""

I dialed back.

>Me: Hi Dale, this is Ryan Thorpe returning your call.  
>Dale: Hey, Ryan. Where are you right now?  
>Me: I'm on the side of Quandary Peak.  
>Dale: That seems like driving distance to Silverton.  
>Me: That was the idea.  
>Dale: Well, I have a bib with your name on it if you're interested.  
>Me: I would be happy to take that off your hands.

With my limited reception, I formally accepted my invitation on Ultrasignup and paid the registration fee right then and there. Then Emily summited her first 14er. Also, we saw mountain goats. It was an exciting day all around.

I posted the good news to social media, and almost immediately got a flurry of congratulatory messages and a few asking if I had taken Zach Miller's spot. Unbeknownst to me, he had just announced that he'd had an emergency appendectomy and didn't know if he could recover in time to run.

This ended up causing a bit of drama for me (yes, I'm going to make Zach's appendectomy about me for a moment; bear with me), because a few days later he announced that his doctor had cleared him to run. If I had Zach's spot, was there a possibility that Dale would now rescind my entry? The Hardrock Instagram page had posted a picture of me and then immediately deleted it. Plus, the lottery webpage still showed me on the waitlist. Was this all a big mistake? I was mostly sure that the organizers would honor my entry, but I couldn't shake the nagging feeling that I was going to go home empty handed. Between these thoughts and the lingering headache that I always get for the first few days at altitude, I became a sullen, miserable prick in the week leading up to Hardrock. Sorry Alex and Em!

Finally, the day of the runner check in came, and I got my number. My mindset immediately flipped from the anxiety of ""Oh shit, I'm not running Hardrock"" to the anxiety of ""Oh shitfuckshit, I'm running Hardrock!"" I calmed my nerves by buying every piece of Hardrock swag available at their expo. I also made it my mission to introduce Emily to all of the most badass women we could find: Courtney Dauwalter, Anna Frost, Maggie Guterl, Stephanie Case, and Tara Warren. Pro tip: If you're too nervous to talk to famous people, just tell them your adorable baby girl wants to meet them.

##**Cruising with Legends (miles 0-11)**

By the time I made it to the starting corral, I was positively vibrating with excitement. This was it: my dream race. Not only that, but I had my wife Alex, my daughter Emily, and some of my best friends (Jess, Boy Alex, and Virginia) there to crew and pace. The dream team for my dream race!

Despite all the adrenaline, I started at my usual conservative pace. So conservative, in fact, that before we had even left the town of Silverton I was the very last runner. Given the amount of older Hardrock veterans at the start, I was a little surprised not to see anyone else walking, but I wasn't overly concerned. Back in 2019 I started the Ouray 100 in last place and worked my way up to 19th by the finish. Let's see how many people I could pass today!

It didn't take long before I caught up to a small pack of runners. I immediately recognized one of them as YouTuber and prolific race director Jamil Coury, who once ran a 29 hour Hardrock in his younger days but had shown up undertrained this year. A few minutes later, 17-time Hardrock finisher Chris Twiggs came charging out of the bushes, explaining simply, ""I had to take a massive shit."" I had found the right crowd to run with. I also spent a few minutes running with American Ultrarunning Hall of Famer Pam Reed, who would tell me jokingly afterwards that I wasn't breathing nearly hard enough for a New Jersey runner. Nice to have some validation from a legend!

The pack slowly spread out and Chris and I ended up running as a duo. I took the opportunity to ask his advice about pacing, nutrition, which sections to carry extra water, etc. Normally this is the kind of stuff I would figure out weeks before a race, but I'd had sort of a mental block about studying the Hardrock course ahead of time. I think this was my small way of protecting myself against the potential disappointment of not getting in. Chris was a wealth of knowledge and was thrilled to have someone to share it all with. We reached the first aid station together quite a bit behind the splits I had given my crew, but I was feeling great and soaking in the experience.

At the pre-run briefing, Dale had described Hardrock as a ""culinary tour of the San Juans,"" explaining that each aid station prides itself on cooking gourmet food. I am typically pretty good at eating during races (and outside of races), and in that moment I decided that I was going to get my money's worth at every opportunity. In my three minute stop at KT, I consumed a full Denny's breakfast worth of bacon and pancakes.

##**Views for Days... Literally (miles 11-28)**

The next section was the crown jewel of Hardrock: Grant Swamp Pass. Despite the name, this might be the most beautiful place in the world. A remote mountain pass with Island Lake on one side and a sweeping view of the San Joaquin ridge on the other. The top of the pass is guarded on both sides by unrelentingly steep scree.

The climb up took a bit of effort, but I was too distracted by the scenery to care. I passed the Joel Zucker memorial at the top and placed a rock on it. It's impossible to convey the severity of the terrain on the descent from the pass, [so instead I'll just link an old video of world class mountain runners struggling to stay upright on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4qsrSsPRns).

I managed to mostly stay upright through this section through an extensive application of upper body movement. That is to say, I flailed my arms wildly as my feet turned over at a thousand steps per minute. I reached the bottom with some scraped palms, both shoes full of debris, and a big stupid grin on my face. I sat down to empty my shoes and recognized Jenny Capel from the briefing. She had applied for ten years before getting in and had been recognized by the race director for her tenacity.

""Was that descent worth the wait?"" I inquired.  
""Fuck no."" was the response.

She would go on to finish, hopefully enjoying the remaining sections a bit more than that one.

I cruised into Chapman aid station in 115th place, having passed thirty people in the first 18 miles. I had told my crew not to make the rugged drive to this aid station, but I was instead greeted by my NY/NJ running friends Elaine, Tiffany, Devang, and Nobu, who had come out to crew for two more of my NY/NJ friends Stephen and Jun. They helped refill my bottles and got me back on the trail after just four minutes. Another lightning quick stop! Stephen and Jun were just ahead, and I hoped I could catch them and spend some time together.

The climb up Oscar's Pass is kind of an early crux of the race. Fully exposed to the afternoon sun and rising almost 3,000 feet in 2.4 miles, it can be a demoralizing climb. On the bright side, like the rest of the course it's breathtakingly beautiful. I passed the time by talking to a Utah-based runner named David Fuller, who would pass me on all the climbs, and whom I would pass back on every descent for the next 30+ hours. Just before the top of the pass, I caught Jun and we chatted for a few minutes. He was moving well but the altitude seemed to be taking its toll on him. He would end up having stomach issues but pushing through for his first Hardrock finish in 46 hours.

The descent into Telluride began as a talus slope but gradually transformed into flowy singletrack. I soaked in the extra oxygen as I dropped below 10,000' for the first time in many hours. I was still riding the high of running THE HARDROCK, I could hear the music thumping, and I was about to see my wife and daughter for the first time since the start. I could barely contain my emotions as I ran into the aid station, now in 89th place.

In my memory, Telluride was a long stop because I scarfed down a burrito, two slices of brisket, and a bunch of watermelon, I changed my socks, and my crew refilled my bottles while I told them about seeing Jun. In reality, all of this happened in just seven minutes. A far cry from Ludovic Pommeret's insane one minute turnaround but still respectable for a mid-pack runner.

I planted a big sweaty kiss on Alex and Emily and I was on my way again.

##**A Quick Stop at Kroger's for Snacks and Tequila (miles 28-44)**

The Kroger's Canteen aid station is the stuff of legends. Perched precariously at the top of the 13,000' Virginius Pass within a gap in the rocks that's barely bigger than a dining room table, Kroger's is staffed by the hardiest volunteers you'll ever meet. Alex and I had tried to hike to it a few weeks before the 2017 Hardrock but got turned around by deep snow. I was looking forward to finally reaching this mythical place.

All I had to do was climb 4,400 feet to get there.

The initial climb out of Telluride was uninspiring, rising steeply up dusty dirt roads as the afternoon sun bore down on us. Vandals had removed a few course markings, and I briefly followed another runner off course before checking my map and correcting our mistake. I heard rumbling in the distance and wondered if we would get a thunderstorm.

Hardrock is held in July as a compromise between allowing the snow to melt off the trails and avoiding the peak of the summer monsoon season. At the Ouray 100 in 2019, a bad thunderstorm had derailed my race. I had not carried enough spare clothing then, and perhaps as an overreaction to that trauma, I was now carrying enough gear to waterproof myself from head to toe. I was thankful for this decision as I imagined myself getting pummeled by a hail storm at 13,000'. Luckily, this was all a moot point as the storm passed harmlessly in the distance, dissipating the afternoon heat nicely in the process.

I finally caught up to my friend Stephen England later in the climb. A type-1 diabetic, he has finished some of the hardest races in the world, making it clear that his disease doesn't limit him whatsoever. His blood sugar was a bit low and he sipped on a Dole fruit cup as he hiked up the steep slope.

I called out ""Hey, it's Stephen America,"" which is our little inside joke that only I find funny.

Once again it was great to run into an east coast friend in the middle of the Colorado wilderness. Unfortunately our pace didn't quite match up and I had a date to attend up at 13,000' so I wished him well and continued on my way. He would end up finishing in 41 hours after a spectacular rally (aka project Saturday).

As the trail snaked its way around Mendota Peak on an ancient mining trail, I scanned the craggy ridge above me looking for a gap where it would be possible to wedge an aid station. I couldn't imagine where you could fit anything useful in this jumble of rocks, but suddenly I heard cheering. Directly above me was Kroger's Canteen.

""You're almost there!"" someone called out.

I held up a finger and responded ""Be with you in a moment,"" before snapping a picture of them.

Then I made the final scramble up to the aid station. It was getting chilly out, so I requested the hottest, saltiest food they could procure. Within seconds I received a handful of wonderfully crispy pan fried pierogis. It's also tradition to have a bit of tequila at Kroger's, so I asked for half a shot. I didn't see the drink being poured, but I heard a *glug glug glug* followed by a volunteer saying ""Whoa, that's a big half shot!""

Welp. Tradition is tradition, and maybe a little ethanol would give me the courage I needed for the vertical mile of descent into Ouray. Down the hatch!

I thanked the volunteers profusely and set to work on the first pitch of the descent. Like Grant Swamp Pass, this section was utter silliness: nearly vertical scree and snow at 13,000'. This kind of terrain has no business being part of a 100 miler, and that's exactly what makes the Hardrock course so special. I attempted a standing glissade down the wall of snow and immediately slipped onto my butt, sliding down the remaining section while burping up smoky mezcal.

I sat for a moment to empty snow and rocks from my shoes before realizing that I had nearly another mile of this kind of terrain ahead of me. I alternated between red-lining down impossibly steep, concrete-hard rock slides, resting on any stable rock, and then plunging downhill again. The terrain was like something straight out of Frozen Snot, but at altitude and with 32 miles on my legs. Insanity. Pure, wonderful, insanity!

After the initial chaos, the course turned onto Camp Bird Road, which is a nicely groomed dirt road. This is the most runnable section of the Hardrock course, but I resisted pushing the pace to make sure I didn't blow my quads too early. A string of 11-12 minute miles had me in the town of Ouray in 75th place with 15 hours elapsed.

##**The Long Dark Night (miles 44-58)**

I shuffled into Ouray just as the last bit of sunlight faded over the horizon. I was confident that I had paced myself well in the early miles and I was excited to have friends to run with for the remainder of the race. 

Fellow east coaster John Kemp was volunteering at Ouray and shuttled food from the aid station grill to my mouth like a mama bird. The culinary tour of the San Juans raged on as I devoured more brisket, a cheeseburger, an ice pop, and a Coke. Somehow I also managed to change my socks again, and I still made it out in eight minutes, now with my trusty training partner Jess keeping me company.

One vital omission from my feeding frenzy in Ouray was a coffee or an energy drink. I hadn't anticipated feeling sleepy at just 8pm, but a week of living in a Sprinter van with an 11 month old had left me severely sleep deprived going into the race. Jess - like all good pacers - is a prolific talker, and we often chat for the entirety of our training runs. But within a couple miles I found myself unable to muster the energy to respond to her. Despite her efforts (and despite being on the most dangerous section of the course), I was fading.

I grunted occasional responses as Jess did her best to keep my mind going with hypothetical questions like, ""If you could watch a concert by any three bands from history, who would you pick and what order would they perform?""

At the remote Engineer aid station, I asked for a coffee and a cup of ramen. I gulped them down like I was doing shots at a college bar and then realized that I was getting very cold very quickly. I put on every layer I had with me and called out ""See you later, Jess!"" I heard a squawk from her as she realized I was already leaving when she had only just gotten her own cup of Ramen. Luckily it only took a moment for her to catch up to me, and we were back to doing our 30min/mi march up to Engineer Pass.

The pass was marked by a blinking red light which was visible for an annoyingly long time. Climbing in the pitch black it was impossible to discern any progress toward that little blinky bastard. After an eternity, we finally made it to the top. I vaguely recall telling the light to go fuck itself, but that might have only happened in my mind.

The descent from the pass was on a relatively easy road but I couldn't find the will to run. We walked into the Animas Forks aid and I plopped down into a chair and announced to my crew that I would be taking a five minute nap. They bundled me in as many layers as they could find and set a timer. Despite my struggles, I had still moved up a few spots and now sat exactly in the middle of the pack at 70th place.

Usually I wake up from these cat naps feeling rejuvenated, but I couldn't get my mind to turn off and instead I just listened to the commotion in the aid station. Nevertheless, when the timer went off, I put my shoes back on and headed back onto the trail with Boy Alex.

##**The Lowest Point at the Highest Point (miles 58-93)**

>*""It‚Äôs gon‚Äô be some work, you should pack a lunch for it"" ‚ÄîProf*

Because of a road closure, my pacers would not be able to switch at Sherman like we had originally planned. This meant that Boy Alex would be pacing me from Animas Forks all the way to Cunningham Gulch, a 35 mile section with about 10,000 feet of climbing. Essentially he was doing a third of Hardrock while having to take care of a cranky baby. But Alex and I have shared a ton of miles on the trails together over the years, and living in the Wasatch he knows how to take care of himself and others in the mountains.

At 14,058', Handies Peak is the high point of the course. It is considered one of the easiest 14ers in Colorado, but the old saying holds true: there are no easy 14ers. That was particularly true after 22 hours of running at altitude. The sleep monster and the altitude monster teamed up on me big time here. When all was said and done, it took me three hours to cover the five miles to the summit. Thankfully, we were greeted by a beautiful sunrise. [And even better, someone from Mountain Outpost was there to film it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v77j9mAuHpE), so I have been able to appreciate the beauty of this section in retrospect.

The descent was milder than some of the previous ones, but I was wobbly on my feet from the sleep deprivation. I kept tripping and slipping on the loose rocks, until finally in a fit of despair I threw myself to the ground and rage napped. Alex was a few minutes behind me, having stopped for a bathroom break. I thankfully heard him coming and gave a little wave to make sure he didn't pass by my corpse.

After another five minute snooze, we continued our trek to the Burrows backcountry aid for a quick stop, and then a short jog into the larger Sherman aid station. Once again, despite ten minutes of napping and probably an hour of time lost to inefficient shambling, I had moved up to 53rd place. That fact really underscores how difficult the night can be in a mountain race.

Usually I come into each aid station with a plan, but I was so deliriously tired that I spent minutes just wandering around searching for something that would get me going again. I have a distant, cloudy memory of eating a breakfast burrito. That was probably tasty, I guess. I think I also chugged coffee. As a new father, I easily go through half a pot of coffee on a normal day, and that caffeine tolerance means I need to consume a positively stupid amount to stay alert during races. I distinctly remember that Elaine, Tiffany, and Devang all made the white-knuckle drive over Cinnamon Pass to see everyone at Sherman, and it was great to have some friends for support at a moment when my brain felt like a bowl of pudding.

Anyway, someone or something must have convinced me to get back onto the trail, and I found myself wandering up the gentle climb to Cataract Lake. I recall Alex saying how beautiful and unexpected the lush forest was here, but I didn't have enough mental bandwidth to give a shit. Above tree line the scenery got even better, and somewhere in here Alex wandered off trail and [captured this video of me](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9zzdqFv052/).

This is another one of those moments that I'm grateful to have a recording to look back on, because at the time I wasn't able to appreciate how stunning the landscape was.

My mind started to come back online here, but the terrain made it difficult to get into a rhythm. The trail was narrow, rutted, and constantly crisscrossed Pole Creek. Rather than attempt to run, I just tried to maintain a fast power hike, which seemed to work well. However, it was becoming clear on the climbs that my lungs were shredded from thirty hours of running at altitude. Each deep breath resulted in a small coughing fit, and I was unable to generate any power despite my legs still feeling strong. I drowned out the noise of my own wheezing by blasting my rap playlist straight from my phone speakers. My apologies to any marmots who don't like Run the Jewels.

The last climb up and over Green Mountain was hilariously steep over cross country terrain. We were coming to the end of Alex's gargantuan pacing section. With a final 1,600' descent in just over a mile, we arrived at Cunningham Gulch, mile 93. I gave Alex a big hug, kissed my Alex and Emily, grabbed some snacks from the aid station, and headed out with Jess for the final nine miles.

##**The Home Stretch (miles 93-102)**

I had originally told the crew that 36 hours might be possible if I had a perfect race. I arrived at this estimate based on my 35:27 finish at TWOT, which is supposedly similar in difficulty to Hardrock. With 36:22 elapsed and time being linear, this goal appeared to be unlikely. I had also mentioned that anything under 40 hours would be pretty satisfying, but that the bottom line was to carry Emily through the finisher chute and kiss the rock. This mental image had been propelling me since the start of the race.

But still, the allure of 40 hours was strong. That gave us 3:38 to go the last nine miles: two miles straight up Little Giant Pass and seven miles downhill to the finish. On paper that sounds reasonable, but my lungs were staging a full scale rebellion. I was breathing so frantically on the climb that Jess turned around multiple times to ask if I was ok.

""Yeah, that's just what my lungs do now,"" I responded.

I had made the wise decision before the race not to have my watch display mile splits. If it had, I would have seen a split of 65 minutes for the first mile of the climb. Granted, that mile had 1,200 feet of ascent, but I believe it to be my slowest ever in a race. Mile two was a significant improvement at just 59 minutes. Dang. Speedy.

We reached the top just in time for sunset. Jess asked if I wanted to stop for a picture and I flipped her the double bird and sprinted away. Or according to her recollection, I sort of grunted with ennui and kept walking. It's unknowable which one of us is remembering this correctly.

That left us with 1:35ish for the last seven miles. Not terrible. We just had to average 13-14 minutes per mile on some relatively mild downhill trails, if I was remembering this section correctly. I've certainly run faster than that on the final descent of other races.

What I hadn't remembered from hiking this section many years ago, was that the first mile was more loose scree.

""Wow this section is pretty tough, Je-oof!"" I said as my feet slid out from under me.

I heard a yelp from behind me and saw Jess also sitting on the trail in a dust cloud. Folks, only the best pacers will time their falls to coincide with yours. It's called teamwork.

That first mile ended up being 19 minutes, which really ate into our cushion. As the terrain got better, Jess ran ahead and started pushing the pace, finding the best line through the rutted Jeep roads. I willed my quads to absorb each downhill step, audibly panting with each breath.

""Stay with me, Ryan. We can do 40 hours,"" she would call back every few minutes.  
""I'm fuckin' trying, brah."" is what I would have said if my lungs were still capable of speaking.

We picked up the pace: 14 minute mile, 13:12, 13:17. This was gonna be close. We hit a rolling section next to the Animas River and I forced myself to run every step through every creek crossing and every diabolical little uphill.

""Shitgoddamnitwhatthefuck?!"" Jess yelled as we reached yet another short steep climb and were forced to walk.

With a mile to go, Jess turned to me and said, ""We have seven minutes to do this. Do you want to go for it?""

And while yeah, it would have been cool to say that I closed out Hardrock with a 6:59 mile and finished under 40 hours, what I wanted more than that was to calmly pick up Emily and walk her through the finisher chute of the first ultramarathon that she ever saw Daddy run.

Also, I desperately had to poop and didn't like the idea of finishing with shit-filled shorts.

After I made a quick stop in the woods, we walked the final mile to the center of Silverton, making sure to break into a jog once we were within sight of the finish line crowd.

Then I gently picked up a very sleepy Emily who was wearing a very fuzzy bear suit.

And we kissed the rock.

Final time 40:14:42, 52nd place.

##**Closing Thoughts**

Finishing at 10pm and being dead tired for most of the race meant that I got a surprisingly good night of sleep. Alex nudged me awake around 6am to remind me that the Hardrock depletion mile was starting soon. I really wanted to get the full Hardrock experience so I trudged over to the Silverton track and did my best impression of a real runner. My legs felt surprisingly good, and I was on pace for a 6:40 mile through the first lap until my lungs reminded me that we were still at altitude. Whatever, it was fun.

The awards ceremony was held on the other end of town under gorgeous blue skies. They served an amazing breakfast and I got to spend some time sharing battle stories with Stephen, Jun, and our pacers. Then my crew spent the rest of the day soaking our feet in Animas River and sipping on local beer. It was a perfect way to end the weekend.

When I think back on this race months after the fact, the feeling that comes to mind is an overwhelming sense of gratitude. I can't adequately express how thankful I am for the opportunity to run this race and for the time and effort that my family and friends put into making it happen. Thank you to Alex and Emily for kisses, cheers, moral support, and allowing me to spend way too many hours on the weekends doing hill repeats at the Water Gap. Thanks to Jess and (Boy) Alex for pacing me through some of the toughest terrain I've ever seen and to Virginia for being on Emily duty so my Alex could focus on me at aid stations. And another huge thanks to Dale Garland and the Hardrock community for putting on such a world class event. This was a truly special experience. Congratulations to Stephen, Jun, and all the other new Hardrockers.

Oh and kudos to Emily's new BFF Courtney Dauwalter for breaking her own course record!

With the benefit of some time to reflect, I have accepted that I can have my dream race without running my dream time.

I still want to go back and break 40 hours though.",1,1729188323.0,trailrunning,0,1.0,False

Anything overrated / over hyped that would be better skipping?

""Economic Treason""

How exactly did it become normalized to give away 500 years of western manufacturing knowledge and know how to 3rd world countries that then turn their back on you?

When Bill Clinton signed Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, he gave away vast sectors of the US economy, plunged the USA into a technologically backwards consensus that has made us reliant on old technology like conventional fired turbine powerplants while China built 55 nuclear powerplants over the last 30 years.

Keep in mind these reactors were built with US reactor designs that were essentially given to China.

The designs that US companies would not give to China were then simply stolen so that the Chinese could get around paying US companies royalties for these technology transfers.

It cannot remain legal for US politicians to give away technology to other nations in this manner.

I would consider any policy that gives away technology in this manner to be an act of Treason.

These are the types of policies that are created by ""Hope"" and ""Feelings"" politicians that do not run on an agenda of stone cold policy.

***""For decades, unbalanced ‚Äúfree‚Äù trade was the preferred option for the most powerful in Washington, and millions of ordinary Americans paid the price. Instead of prioritizing healthy American communities, good jobs, higher wages, and a promising future for our workers, Washington too often cared more about corporate profits, cheap imports and the concerns of foreign governments, including the Chinese. In return, we got cheaper coffee makers and tee shirts, while thousands of factories closed, wages stagnated, communities deteriorated, economic inequality rose in our country, and we racked up trillions of dollars in trade deficits.""***

***""Trade disputes are usually understood as conflicts between countries with competing national interests, but as Matthew C. Klein and Michael Pettis show, they are often the unexpected result of domestic political choices to serve the interests of the rich at the expense of workers and ordinary retirees. Klein and Pettis trace the origins of today‚Äôs trade wars to decisions made by politicians and business leaders in China, Europe, and the United States over the past thirty years. Across the world, the rich have prospered while workers can no longer afford to buy what they produce, have lost their jobs, or have been forced into higher levels of debt. In this thought‚Äëprovoking challenge to mainstream views, the authors provide a cohesive narrative that shows how the class wars of rising inequality are a threat to the global economy and international peace‚Äîand what we can do about it.""***

this morning i got my free coffee and even though he wasn‚Äôt the one to give it to me, he literally came around the counter to talk to me and he told me where he‚Äôs from and that he recently moved to my town before i left for work. 

guys, he is SO CUTE. he always smiles at me when i come in and will make an effort to chat to me even if he‚Äôs doing something else and ask me questions about my job and stuff. i have a big fat crush on him (which is extremely rare for me to have crushes in the first place so im like completely consumed by this) and want to go to the coffee shop tomorrow even though im not even working just so i can see him, he gives me butterflies like crazy. 

i‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs actually flirting though or just being nice out of solidarity as we work close by each other? i don‚Äôt want to overthink because i tend to be controlled by my emotions and don‚Äôt want to be irrational but ive already tried to look him up on social media to see if he has a girlfriend or is gay so i don‚Äôt drive myself crazy for nothing, but ive literally found no evidence that he exists beyond me seeing him in the shop. my best friend says he‚Äôs definitely flirting but might have his hands tied because it‚Äôs his place of work and doesn‚Äôt want to ask out a customer when he‚Äôs working, which makes complete sense, but my mum says he should make the first move as he‚Äôs already says he knows where i work and therefore should come to my job at least once to say hi or ask me on a date. i don‚Äôt want to be the one to make the first move because im so scared about being rejected and then being so embarrassed i never get the really good coffee ever again. my best friend has suggested writing my number on a napkin or even the stamp card next time i go but im so scared of rejection i don‚Äôt know what to do.

I enjoy... 
Metallic scents (blood, rust), tobacco, smoke, black coffee, alcohol, leather, cement/marble(?)
Less sought but considered nonetheless are wood/forestry scents, dust/dirt, rain, charcoal, vanilla or floral tones... Floral is fine but I wouldn't want it to be the focal point of a fragrance.
Some extra descriptors for what I'm looking for... Something dark, strange, unsettling, gloomy, grungy, atmospheric. Something gothic, ""horror-esque,"" maybe? I'm not sure how else to describe it, other than I would like it to subtly throw people off. 

Indie scents are appreciated. I am considering Death & Floral (but was unable to post in the indie makeup/fragrances reddit due to my account's age.)

What stood out to me in Death & Floral's catalog were,

-Before you were dust
-Bones melting together
-Doom and gloom
-Doomsday
-Everything is more beautiful because we are doomed
-Honey Metal
-Inside a nightmare
-Monsters Still Under My Bed
-Morton salt girl
-Mountain cats will come to drag away your bones
-Plain Jane
-Queen of Moths
-Shadow monsters on wooden cabin walls
-The end is here
-The Killing Moon
-The people you love become ghosts inside you (really considering this one)

Any experiences with these scents and your take on them would be greatly appreciated. 

Please feel free to make recommendations as I am rather clueless in navigating this on my own. Thank you kindly and I hope this is an appropriate request to make here.

Traditionally I work half day Fridays.

The move back to the office means I am losing that so called ""work-life"" balance. I live maybe 10 minutes from the office by car which isn't a terribly long commute and I am super grateful for it but I am rubbed super wrong by all this and am feeling a bit of existential dread. There are days I don't work all 9 hours of the day, and there are days where I am fully engaged.

I am losing the ability to chuck a load of laundry in when I stretch my legs, make home coffee, pet and see my animals and also will lose the ability to see my Son off to school/daycare in the morning while I am opening emails and getting going for the day.

How am I supposed to feel about this all? My brain says I am whining because I have a stable job with decent pay in a Low Cost Of Living Area but I find myself completely unable to fathom my corporations decision on this matter. I hate living in a world where someone decided they need to ensure we are sitting in seats all day.

I have shared a bit with of my kitchen in comments (and a couple of other subs) and posted my living room transformation the other day. I know painting cabinets and altering ‚Äúthe triangle‚Äù are super controversial but I love how it turned out!

The appliances were so cramped together that we had a hard time cooking without bumping into one another. We made the decision to move the fridge to an empty corner opposite the island. It gave us much more room and we‚Äôre still able to pull items from the fridge/pantry to prep on the island just like before. 

We also moved the granite from the island to the new coffee bar which also houses the microwave. We replaced the island granite with butcher block that I stained/sealed. We installed an industrial hood vent that vents outside and built a maple surround. 

We added wood/crown to hide the vent ductwork and to take the cabinets up to the ceiling. It makes the ceilings feel so much taller. We also installed beadboard and built a fridge surround. New lighting, a thin brick backsplash, new trim and wall paint helped transform the space too! 

My favorite thing is that nothing went into a landfill. Everything was repurposed which saved us a lot of money. 

My furniture is secondhand/thrifted. Most of the decor is also thrifted or things that belonged to my grama. I don‚Äôt care about trends or whether or not something is in/out. ",7,1729187361.0,HomeDecorating,2,1.0,False

So, I like it very much. It is small foot print, quiet, no retention and produces nice medium to dark roast coffee for my taste. And it is my first grinder pared wit Lelit Bianca 
Recently I was hit with upgradeditis. 
And I am thinking about Mazzer Philos. It is 995 eur investment. All reviews are positive about this grinder, and I think 64mm burrs are good price/ratio for espresso coffee.
But I have one very important question. Will my espresso be upgraded 4 times a price difference with those grinders? Is it worth to spend 1k euro on new grinder? 
Can someone comment if this was your route?
Will be very appreciated!

1g5wsfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1g5wsfa/the_backroads_the_masked_lurker/,The Backroads: The Masked Lurker,"Thinking about things you shouldn‚Äôt is an established trait among humans, whether we developed that horrid trait through evolution or it just being a part of us that we always had I don‚Äôt know but I hate it. It sucks and it sucks more when you need just to let go of those certain events however on the road trapped in the Evernight it‚Äôs an impossibility. One does not simply erase horrors from the mind no matter how hard they try but luckily you can distract yourself, you can let your mind wander while driving for hours in the dark. My routine would consist of podcasts blasting music like a sane person, the one thing I‚Äôd recommend is to not fuel that burning desire to dwell on those bad thoughts or memories. Don‚Äôt be stupid and listen to horror videos or true crime podcasts. Don‚Äôt listen to that conspiracy theorist who has his radio station and has the southern voice that draws you in for it will only bring you to contemplate the strange happenings in your neck of the woods, along with the healthy dose distrust with the government staples of the country. Not that his points aren't entirely wrong but most people rather live in bliss. Don‚Äôt listen and think about the creepy shit on the radio, podcast, whatever just leave it as background noise believe me when I say the allure of horror should be kept to fiction as inviting into your life is never a clever idea. And for the love of God and all that is holy don‚Äôt fucking text and drive.

Now you might be wondering ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt I think about the creepy shit or bad memories in my life?‚Äô and my answer should be obvious, it‚Äôs creepy shit at night I don‚Äôt care about how brave or edgy you think you are. Out in the dark, that type of vibe can invite things to you, things that look human but well aren‚Äôt. This was made clear to me that my thoughts out at night can both influence and attract certain entities to someone‚Äôs location, some of these beings may be beneficial and can be extremely dangerous. You might ask how some can be beneficial to you. Well from what I‚Äôve heard there are helpful entities that grant people who might come across them with money, treasures, or a sense of peace. Others don‚Äôt do anything remotely close to beneficial but aren‚Äôt exactly out to cause chaos to unfold they just more or less linger in the limbo of the Evernight. The best description I can utilize for them is in the simplest terms, weird. Events that occur be it creepy or riding on the side of weird stupid shit, for instance, there are odd occurrences, like a clown car honking its horn three times, where one of the passengers grants you a sight of a full moon on a clouded night - a peculiar incident, to say the least.

You may think to yourself ‚ÄòOh I‚Äôm fine, it‚Äôs just creepy clowns at night.‚Äô Yeah, many people thought the same thing back in the late 2010s and that ended up with people dead so good luck with that mentality. See in the Evernight you should have at least two rules with you encounter horrifying shit. The first option is to run like hell, or rather drive like a bat out of hell. The second and the riskier is to grab your gat and hold it sideways and explain why this bitch done fucked up. That‚Äôs assuming you have a Glock lying about inside of your car and you can hit while holding sideways. If not plan three seems to work best for some of my fellow contracted coworkers from the various parts of the great United States. Shoot and drive.

I listed the options above as such because when it comes down to it you must either fight or run. And I always say when you choose to run there is no shame in that. You‚Äôre a regular person after all not the protagonist in a novel. When it comes down to decisions you need to value your life and not play stupid games. I also give out these options because you want to learn from others, or you can be like my coworker. He told me about his time driving in the Evernight while I was still under his tutelage, he spoke to me often of his crazy experiences, and although he was extremely inebriated along with smoking way more pot than a den dedicated to growing marijuana. I listened and took away lessons from him. And before you question why he was, I don‚Äôt know why he decided to info dump his hellish stories unto me but there were plenty of bat shit tales that he experienced which most likely led to his current state however being the kind person I am, I leant him my ear. Besides when driving for nearly 12 hours a night having someone ramble about their time working the job you are taking over helps immensely for the first weeks on the job. I‚Äôm more than positive he was a sober great individual, but that person was long gone and the man I had sitting next to me was nothing more than a shell who only functioned from strong booze and somehow managed to drive sober enough to get to his destination. It was enough to keep his employment but of course, it wasn‚Äôt for long.

I made mistakes of dwelling on the terrible memories I made throughout my trips, and I allowed myself to let the supernatural influence my mind while driving and it caused stress like no other. By this point in my life, I learned that the supernatural is very much real and you should at the bare minimum give it the respect it deserves. Don‚Äôt misinterpret what I say next. When you do night drives for as long as I have, no matter the main road, or the backroads you will have an experience that will be seared into your mind or several, and you should treat it with some kind of respect. Not saying you should give a supernatural entity polite speech or anything like that. What I mean is if you encounter a monster, you treat the situation with some actual brain power and deal with it accordingly. For example, if you see a creature that resembles a human stand up screeching in the road within your headlights. You shouldn‚Äôt pull your phone out and film it and hope the cameraman rule applies to you, life is not a movie, and it may not send a saving grace to protect you in the moment that does happen.

Oh yeah, I forgot my old coworker's story, this one isn't necessarily supernatural at least I don't think it is true, but you can consider it an example of what I told you above, you should not put bad thoughts into the world, because the world may respond equally.

I remember he told me a story, on one of his travels he spotted a woman running from the wilderness into the main road and he stopped for her. Her face was that of a gorgeous model and she wore a beautiful white dress. He thought ‚ÄúScore.‚Äù At first and rolled his window down asking where she needed to go. He was told she needed just to get to the next town as fast as possible so that her husband wouldn‚Äôt find her and to at least take her to the hospital.

He was asking what happened to her as she got into his vehicle, and she explained to him that she was beaten by him countless times and she finally mustered up the courage to leave him. She fled with a friend who she trusted and when her husband found her, he beat her and the friend up and shot his friend. She ran away and got a ride from an Uber, but the Uber wouldn‚Äôt take her that far after they were shot at, so she fled down the road and into the wilderness. Feeling horrible for her he sped off telling her she‚Äôd be fine and that she would be taken to the hospital and the police notified.

During this trip she was asking questions and began to get sexual with him, she was being overly flirtatious and despite his better judgment, he let his little brain get the better of him. While they started getting a little busy, he had undone her dress only to discover that she had bullet wounds and stab wounds in her stomach. When he saw this the woman grew angry, she began screeching while grasping at his throat. Screaming he tried getting her off and out of the vehicle only to wake up in the truck alone on the side of the road parked. The only thing he had was the scent of her lingering and the blood still all over his clothes, driving away he shuddered in fear.

That was the story I remembered on one of my trips it was a Friday night. I got my coffee and grabbed my keys to pack up the vehicle they provided me at this old military building that was repurposed for whatever the company uses it for now. I was told to take the supplies they had ready to another contractor in a city a few hours up and come back with some supplies they had in their vehicle. The job was simple, swap the goods and get back down. If anything, else was required they would inform me through text and send me. Simple enough, normal stuff everything that this company takes always goes back to this lab up in a big city and we are sent to collect the items or trade whatever essentially, we are mostly contract couriers. The job was as simple as they come and so I made my way to grab what I needed to form the hospital as directed.

I soon began my long drive into the endless blackness of the Evernight with nothing but the destination in mind. I drove on with music playing and thoughts of ‚Äòwhat horrors may come to play tonight‚Äô. That was the wrong thought because that was the day, I witnessed the first untimely deaths on the road. My mind was racing at the story my coworker told me before I was a free man doing these jobs on my own. It wasn't creepy but I wouldn't know what to do in that situation, not the horny woman in the car. But if someone was riding with me and suddenly attacked me or met someone on the side of the road who needed my help.

As for my story, I vividly remember that night‚Äîit was 2337 I was going about 87 miles an hour on the empty backroads. They were considered to be the new long toll roads however due to the pricing no one ever took them, eventually, they became free however still due to being so far out no one took them. There was a bend in the road with overgrown grass alongside a hill which was the reason I didn't see the hazard lights on the road and they weren't far at all, slamming on the brakes I came to a halt a little way from the vehicle, and my adrenaline spiked at the sudden action I had to take as I contemplated what could have happened had my reaction been a second slower. I would have collided with the vehicle and at best very injured or worse ‚Äì a direct collision with the car. Illuminating the area with my high beams, I discerned a lone white Toyota Camry obstructing the road. Inside, there were figures slumped in their seats, with red stains on the window.

My instincts took over as I unbuckled my seat belt, opened the passenger storage compartment for first aid, and quickly placed it in the center console. Picking up my head and turning for my door I looked out into the night through the window and there briefly illuminated by the hazard lights was a dark figure hidden slightly in the brush. I paused my movement and stared waiting for the lights to flicker on again. As they did, I saw the figure looking at me tilt its head slightly, curious if it was spotted. It was pure luck I noticed; the figure crouched in the grass divider tucked by some of that thick brush. But it was close enough to notice.

My mind raced with thoughts. ‚Äú*What should I do? Should I drive off? Open the door and scream at him to leave? No, I don‚Äôt know what he has. If I don‚Äôt do something now, he‚Äôs going to make the first move.‚Äù*

A few moments went by, and I decided to open the door, I steadied my breathing while cursing myself for doing something that could get me killed. The moment I opened the door and exited I pulled out my gun from its holster and turned my weapon light to expose the figure locking in with my red dot sight. During the few seconds I had opened my door and stepped out the figure had stood up but froze the moment, I turned that beam on and placed a hand up blocking the light in his other hand I took full notice of his still dripping red liquid-stained large knife. I held my position and demanded what he wanted from me.

No verbal response was given however his actions did give a response; he made a slicing motion on his neck as he took a step forward toward me. He must have thought I had a regular flashlight because he continued to step towards me as I yelled for him to stop. I shouted as loud as I could for him to stop moving. Even though he was a decent distance away from where I was a dead sprint from his distance is still dangerous because bullets don‚Äôt stop someone immediately. When he continued to move to me slowly, methodically this was something he was well versed in doing many, many times. I shouted for him to drop the knife and by his fourth step he stopped. I think he finally took notice that what was in my hand wasn't a normal light.

The moment he ceased all movement and that granted me precious seconds of planning. From the looks of it, I could shoot this hooded figure dead and be cleared of any wrongdoing, or I could get back into the vehicle and run away and never think about this again. Another part of me just screamed for me to shoot him and end his life. Whatever bravery the hooded figure showed earlier, he certainly lost it all as the gun was reason enough to not pick this would-be prey tonight and that was good enough for me. He took a few steps back and gave me a small wave as he casually walked away. After he got further into the grass, he gently removed the hood to show a blank mask, one of those party masks you get at a party store. The white mask had noticeable red stains scattered all over the left cheek and to contrast the messy left side was just one long bloody tear coming down from the right eye slit.

After fading into the darkness, I called the police and waited for them to get there, during that time I inspected the body that was in the car, staring up into the car was a handsome young man who was holding his neck, blood splayed across his shirt and fear painted on his face. The multiple stab wounds in his chest indicated the cause of death. In the passenger‚Äôs seat was a beautiful woman who was coughing up blood reaching for the door handle gurgling still and crying in pain, whimpering at the sight of me. I heard her cries as I ran to my car and grabbed a first aid bag. I ran to the side of the car put on the emergency gloves and pulled out gauze and other first aid equipment. I opened the door and assisted her out of the car hearing her cry holding onto me as her blood pooled onto me.

I pulled her to the light of the vehicle and began first aid. She was trying to tell me something however I didn‚Äôt understand her at all. She pointed to her stomach and told me, ‚ÄúIt hurts. Scared.‚Äù She said in gurgled breaths. I tried to do everything I could to prevent the bleeding from continuing however I didn‚Äôt know how long she may have. I cut her shirt with the emergency scissors and looked at her body, the source of her bleeding was the three stab wounds to her stomach, I grabbed some of the clotting gauze and began putting it onto the knife wounds and wrapping them around her stomach as her cries of pain echoed into the night. Minutes felt like hours, and I held her there in the night as she kept crying out for help. She was holding onto my blood stand jacket as I kept her other hand on her wound putting pressure on it.

Occasionally the sound of a crunch echoed in the grassy patches to which my response was a sweep with my pistol with the light on and ready to shoot. My fear grew not only for me but the woman I now held in my arms, I was scared, not just for her as horrible as it sounds. I didn‚Äôt want to get stabbed by the masked man because that would mean certain death for both of us. My attention was stretched thin from both the sounds of the grass on the other side of the road and the young girl's moans of pain. The bleeding wouldn't stop so I had to help her the best way I knew how. Pulling more of the first aid out applying more of the gauze on her wound and pushing her into the recovery position.

I did my best to tell her to keep talking, fight through the pain, and keep telling me random facts about anything. My goal was to keep her away from death for as long as I could. The growing fear that I would be the last person on this planet to see her before she died was becoming a reality the longer I waited for the police.

All the while I kept on the lookout for the police. Finally, after what felt like a lifetime both law enforcement came alongside an ambulance, the relief of seeing those red and blue lights was unlike any other. I put my gun quickly away as I exclaimed to the woman she would be okay. I saw one of the medical personnel get out of the vehicle one quickly walk over to her, while I moved aside for them I didn't take note of who it was but one of the people grabbed me and promptly shoved me into the Camry.

It then hit me as the cold steel of the handcuffs placed on me, my mind registered it was a police officer who was now reading me my rights. As he was shouting at me, I could only stare into the shocked expression of the young man who lifelessly sat in the car in front of me. I could only recall being shoved into the car twice over and the cop screaming at me demanding 'What happened to him!? Tell me damn it.'

Finally, after what felt like what would have been another bashing, the man‚Äôs motion abruptly stopped, and a female voice asked me to explain myself as I felt the strong grip of the man loosen and drop away from my arms.

Turning my head to her I looked at the man who cuffed and slammed my head into the car, the startling realization that he looked remarkably like the young boy in the car. With tears rolling down his cheek I understood his frustration. The female officer took me and guided me to her car where we spoke of my encounter. I told her what had happened mentioning how I just saw a hooded figure walk away from me waving goodbye. She shook her head in disbelief however even if my brief explanation didn‚Äôt give them much to work it did seem to clear me of any involvement other than being the unlucky individual who stumbled upon the scene.

She said to me, ‚ÄúYou know she might make it, and it's thanks to you. You‚Äôre a hero.‚Äù I looked at her almost disgusted by the word, I was not a hero that is for sure. A hero would have done more, I did not even shoot the man responsible for it.

She wrote down my information and said she would contact me if anything came up for whatever reason they would need me. But as far as they were concerned and needed. I was free to go after an hour. I thanked them and her turning I made my way to my vehicle. Driving off I looked back at the eerie sight of the red and blue flashing lights of the EMS swallowing the hazard lights which were losing their power and fading into small faint orange lights by now.

I felt regret hit me a sort of heaviness in my chest, the thing I noticed when I was there was how in the car I noticed their phones, purses, and even his backpack inside the car were not messed with just those two individuals who were murdered. They were just prey to a monster in human skin within the Evernight, it was not a robbery gone wrong, it was just murder for the sake of murder. That experience gave me a rush I didn‚Äôt want to feel, the cold feeling of adrenaline flowing through my body as I was thrust into a fight or flight response coincided with the painful guilt. The guilt of not pulling the trigger and ending his life. That unhealthy guilt of knowing I let a monster get away into the darkness of the Evernight.",1,1729187159.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I know.......... Shameless plugs...... We live in the digital age peeps, tis what I'tiss.

But heres a short story as well to make up for ‚¨ÜÔ∏è this jazz.

On the bus from Austin to Boston (really NYC but that doesn't rhyme so lol) there was an old black lady who was hunched over. I knew from experience that it was most likely osteoporosis, anyways the buses we were on both were late getting to ATL where we met and as a result we had to wait in the station for 9 hours. She was coming from Tennessee and me from Texas. I chose to sleep in a bush near the station and at first only noticed her when she got off her bus.

Fast forward to Baltimore where we had an hour and a half layover, I helped her grab her Walker from the Bottom of the bus before she got off so she didn't have to struggle with it, she went from a frown to a smile (something I live for) in the station she asked to me to sit and have a conversation but I needed some coffee so I went up the street to grab one.

I've learned to pay attention to things around me at all times and remembered in Raleigh when she ordered a coffee that she took 3 sugar and 2 cream, so I decided to buy her one and make it up the way she drinks it. When I got back to the station I say next to her and she noticed I had two coffees and mentioned that she was craving one. I told her I drink it black with no sugar but if she wanted one of mine I would give it to her. She thanked me as I handed it to her and you could see in her eyes that it wasn't what she wanted but it would do. Keep in mind she wasn't aware that I made it up the way she likes it. When she took the first sip she looked over at me with joy (again I love to see people smile). Then she asked what was up and I told her, she thanked me profusely.

Anyways fast forward to pulling into port authority and getting off the bus, I grabbed her Walker again and she told me she had lived in Brooklyn for 2 years but never took the subway from Port authority and didn't know where to go. I've been to NYC twice before but never took the subway but I decided I'd help her get to the train and send her in the right direction. She taught me how to sneak a ride and we entered the platform and she agreed if it's like to sleep on her couch. I felt awkward about it and declined but just as the train was pulling up she said she was so tired and had her luggage to carry so it would be hard to get to her front door.

I sleep outside so I can find a spot anywhere and decided to get her to her door. After we get off in Brooklyn she took me to get food and then we went to her place, at the door I decided I'd stay the night. The end, moral of the story is making friends isn't that hard, keeping them is, didn't be afraid to take risks but also know when it's appropriate to say no. Now when I'm in NYC I have a friend I can visit, and she's a really cool lady from the hoods of Jersey (wise).

1g5wqx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g5wqx9/aita_for_telling_a_mutual_friend_about_our_other/,AITA for telling a mutual friend about our other friend‚Äôs relationship because she lied about me?,"OK.. this is a long one. So me (20F) and my friend Sam (late 30‚Äôs F) had a fight a month or two ago. Sam has been on and off with this guy Joe. Joe isn‚Äôt looking for commitment but Sam is. I never really liked him because he‚Äôs been going to court for violent offenses, he doesn‚Äôt have a job, and he doesn‚Äôt have a home. He‚Äôs been mooching off Sam this whole time for money and sex. Sam has been super hot and cold on whether she likes him. Regardless, I was always there to listen to her talk about him. Well when she told me about the violent offenses I got really concerned because she has a history of abusive relationships. It ended with us kinda fighting and totally disagreeing. Not a big deal, friends fight. I end up telling her that we probably shouldn‚Äôt talk about Joe so much because we clearly don‚Äôt agree. Here‚Äôs where it went wrong.

She‚Äôs like.. ok no problem. I see her at work the next day and she‚Äôs acting a little weird but whatever. A few days later I notice she‚Äôs blocked me on Instagram‚Ä¶ weird. She hasn‚Äôt said anything to me. So when I see her again I say ‚ÄúHey what‚Äôs up? You blocked me.‚Äú She totally blows up on me. Calling me a bad friend, saying that I wasn‚Äôt there for her when she was vulnurable, and that I was ‚Äùputting our friendship in a box‚Äù. I‚Äôm totally shocked! I had no idea she felt that way so I say ‚Äúwoah that wasn‚Äôt my intention at all I just wanted to stop fighting about this. We can still talk about your emotions and stuff‚Äù. She goes totally ice cold. Says she doesn‚Äôt want to be friends anymore and she‚Äôs better off without me. I don‚Äôt even know what to say so I just tearfully tell her that I love her and I was trying to do what‚Äôs best. Doesn‚Äôt matter. I was devastated, she‚Äôs the closest friend I have (other than my boyfriend) since moving to the city I live in now for college. I couldn‚Äôt believe she would drop me just like that.

I‚Äôm depressed for a bit but I go to therapy so I worked through it and moved on. No biggie. Well my buddy Will (24M) ends up breaking up with his girlfriend. We‚Äôre mutual friends with Sam. I hit him up and say we should get some coffee so we can chat about it. I‚Äôm in school for Psychology so I try to help my friends out when I can. We hang out for a while and he‚Äôs talking about his ex when suddenly he‚Äôs like ‚Äúhey are you and Sam still beefing?‚Äù I‚Äôm surprised because I hadn‚Äôt told anyone about this situation, but I figure Sam told him. I‚Äôm like.. ‚Äúwell we‚Äôre not beefing really. She said she didn‚Äôt want to talk to me anymore so I don‚Äôt see any resolution in the future‚Äù He looks surprised so I ask him what she said. He said that she told him I ended the relationship because I got offended over a sarcastic comment she made. This did actually happen over SIX MONTHS AGO. I was venting about something and she said ‚Äùok are you done talking about yourself now?‚Äù As a joke and I got offended.

So I‚Äôm like nah what the fuck. I tell him what really happened and he‚Äôs super shocked because he didn‚Äôt know anything about Joe. This makes sense because Sam has been trying to hook up with Will for forever, so I‚Äôm sure she didn‚Äôt tell him about the guy she‚Äôs seeing for that reason. Apparently Sam and Will have been hanging out a ton lately and that‚Äôs why he asked me about her. I was fucking livid that she tried and turned the blame on ME when I did all I could to salvage the friendship. She made it seem like I ended it all over a little comment which is totally untrue.

Now here‚Äôs where I feel like the asshole- I really shouldn‚Äôt have told Will about her boyfriend. She clearly didn‚Äôt want him to know. But also a.) I didn‚Äôt tell Will that Sam is interested in him and b.) The only way to clear up the situation is tell the truth. So I don‚Äòt know. I‚Äôm back and forth on it. AITA?

TLDR; My friend Sam lied to our other friend Will about why me and Sam‚Äôs relationship ended. It ended because I didn‚Äôt agree with Sam‚Äôs boyfriend and she cut me off, but she told him I broke it up over a sarcastic comment. So I told Will what actually happened even though I knew Sam didn‚Äôt want him to know about her boyfriend because she‚Äôs trying to hook up with Will (Sam and her boyfriend are not monogamous and very off and on so it wasn‚Äôt cheating).

a grinder brand told me:

""Thank you for your inquiry. Regarding grinding frozen coffee beans in your coffee grinder, we generally do not recommend it due to the potential for moisture residue, which could lead to rusting.

While we understand that some individuals prefer to freeze their coffee beans to preserve freshness, the moisture that may be present in frozen beans could pose a risk to the internal components of your grinder. Rusting could occur over time if the moisture is not properly managed.

However, if you still wish to proceed with grinding frozen beans, we strongly advise you to clean your grinder frequently to minimize the risk of moisture build-up. Please be aware that there is still a possibility of internal components rusting, even with regular cleaning.""

1g5wn64,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1g5wn64/the_backroads_the_masked_lurker/,The Backroads: The Masked Lurker,"Thinking about things you shouldn‚Äôt is an established trait among humans, whether we developed that horrid trait through evolution or it just being a part of us that we always had I don‚Äôt know but I hate it. It sucks and it sucks more when you need just to let go of those certain events however on the road trapped in the Evernight it‚Äôs an impossibility. One does not simply erase horrors from the mind no matter how hard they try but luckily you can distract yourself, you can let your mind wander while driving for hours in the dark. My routine would consist of podcasts blasting music like a sane person, the one thing I‚Äôd recommend is to not fuel that burning desire to dwell on those bad thoughts or memories. Don‚Äôt be stupid and listen to horror videos or true crime podcasts. Don‚Äôt listen to that conspiracy theorist who has his radio station and has the southern voice that draws you in for it will only bring you to contemplate the strange happenings in your neck of the woods, along with the healthy dose distrust with the government staples of the country. Not that his points aren't entirely wrong but most people rather live in bliss. Don‚Äôt listen and think about the creepy shit on the radio, podcast, whatever just leave it as background noise believe me when I say the allure of horror should be kept to fiction as inviting into your life is never a clever idea. And for the love of God and all that is holy don‚Äôt fucking text and drive.

Now you might be wondering ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt I think about the creepy shit or bad memories in my life?‚Äô and my answer should be obvious, it‚Äôs creepy shit at night I don‚Äôt care about how brave or edgy you think you are. Out in the dark, that type of vibe can invite things to you, things that look human but well aren‚Äôt. This was made clear to me that my thoughts out at night can both influence and attract certain entities to someone‚Äôs location, some of these beings may be beneficial and can be extremely dangerous. You might ask how some can be beneficial to you. Well from what I‚Äôve heard there are helpful entities that grant people who might come across them with money, treasures, or a sense of peace. Others don‚Äôt do anything remotely close to beneficial but aren‚Äôt exactly out to cause chaos to unfold they just more or less linger in the limbo of the Evernight. The best description I can utilize for them is in the simplest terms, weird. Events that occur be it creepy or riding on the side of weird stupid shit, for instance, there are odd occurrences, like a clown car honking its horn three times, where one of the passengers grants you a sight of a full moon on a clouded night - a peculiar incident, to say the least.

You may think to yourself ‚ÄòOh I‚Äôm fine, it‚Äôs just creepy clowns at night.‚Äô Yeah, many people thought the same thing back in the late 2010s and that ended up with people dead so good luck with that mentality. See in the Evernight you should have at least two rules with you encounter horrifying shit. The first option is to run like hell, or rather drive like a bat out of hell. The second and the riskier is to grab your gat and hold it sideways and explain why this bitch done fucked up. That‚Äôs assuming you have a Glock lying about inside of your car and you can hit while holding sideways. If not plan three seems to work best for some of my fellow contracted coworkers from the various parts of the great United States. Shoot and drive.

I listed the options above as such because when it comes down to it you must either fight or run. And I always say when you choose to run there is no shame in that. You‚Äôre a regular person after all not the protagonist in a novel. When it comes down to decisions you need to value your life and not play stupid games. I also give out these options because you want to learn from others, or you can be like my coworker. He told me about his time driving in the Evernight while I was still under his tutelage, he spoke to me often of his crazy experiences, and although he was extremely inebriated along with smoking way more pot than a den dedicated to growing marijuana. I listened and took away lessons from him. And before you question why he was, I don‚Äôt know why he decided to info dump his hellish stories unto me but there were plenty of bat shit tales that he experienced which most likely led to his current state however being the kind person I am, I leant him my ear. Besides when driving for nearly 12 hours a night having someone ramble about their time working the job you are taking over helps immensely for the first weeks on the job. I‚Äôm more than positive he was a sober great individual, but that person was long gone and the man I had sitting next to me was nothing more than a shell who only functioned from strong booze and somehow managed to drive sober enough to get to his destination. It was enough to keep his employment but of course, it wasn‚Äôt for long.

I made mistakes of dwelling on the terrible memories I made throughout my trips, and I allowed myself to let the supernatural influence my mind while driving and it caused stress like no other. By this point in my life, I learned that the supernatural is very much real and you should at the bare minimum give it the respect it deserves. Don‚Äôt misinterpret what I say next. When you do night drives for as long as I have, no matter the main road, or the backroads you will have an experience that will be seared into your mind or several, and you should treat it with some kind of respect. Not saying you should give a supernatural entity polite speech or anything like that. What I mean is if you encounter a monster, you treat the situation with some actual brain power and deal with it accordingly. For example, if you see a creature that resembles a human stand up screeching in the road within your headlights. You shouldn‚Äôt pull your phone out and film it and hope the cameraman rule applies to you, life is not a movie, and it may not send a saving grace to protect you in the moment that does happen.

Oh yeah, I forgot my old coworker's story, this one isn't necessarily supernatural at least I don't think it is true, but you can consider it an example of what I told you above, you should not put bad thoughts into the world, because the world may respond equally.

I remember he told me a story, on one of his travels he spotted a woman running from the wilderness into the main road and he stopped for her. Her face was that of a gorgeous model and she wore a beautiful white dress. He thought ‚ÄúScore.‚Äù At first and rolled his window down asking where she needed to go. He was told she needed just to get to the next town as fast as possible so that her husband wouldn‚Äôt find her and to at least take her to the hospital.

He was asking what happened to her as she got into his vehicle, and she explained to him that she was beaten by him countless times and she finally mustered up the courage to leave him. She fled with a friend who she trusted and when her husband found her, he beat her and the friend up and shot his friend. She ran away and got a ride from an Uber, but the Uber wouldn‚Äôt take her that far after they were shot at, so she fled down the road and into the wilderness. Feeling horrible for her he sped off telling her she‚Äôd be fine and that she would be taken to the hospital and the police notified.

During this trip she was asking questions and began to get sexual with him, she was being overly flirtatious and despite his better judgment, he let his little brain get the better of him. While they started getting a little busy, he had undone her dress only to discover that she had bullet wounds and stab wounds in her stomach. When he saw this the woman grew angry, she began screeching while grasping at his throat. Screaming he tried getting her off and out of the vehicle only to wake up in the truck alone on the side of the road parked. The only thing he had was the scent of her lingering and the blood still all over his clothes, driving away he shuddered in fear.

That was the story I remembered on one of my trips it was a Friday night. I got my coffee and grabbed my keys to pack up the vehicle they provided me at this old military building that was repurposed for whatever the company uses it for now. I was told to take the supplies they had ready to another contractor in a city a few hours up and come back with some supplies they had in their vehicle. The job was simple, swap the goods and get back down. If anything, else was required they would inform me through text and send me. Simple enough, normal stuff everything that this company takes always goes back to this lab up in a big city and we are sent to collect the items or trade whatever essentially, we are mostly contract couriers. The job was as simple as they come and so I made my way to grab what I needed to form the hospital as directed.

I soon began my long drive into the endless blackness of the Evernight with nothing but the destination in mind. I drove on with music playing and thoughts of ‚Äòwhat horrors may come to play tonight‚Äô. That was the wrong thought because that was the day, I witnessed the first untimely deaths on the road. My mind was racing at the story my coworker told me before I was a free man doing these jobs on my own. It wasn't creepy but I wouldn't know what to do in that situation, not the horny woman in the car. But if someone was riding with me and suddenly attacked me or met someone on the side of the road who needed my help.

As for my story, I vividly remember that night‚Äîit was 2337 I was going about 87 miles an hour on the empty backroads. They were considered to be the new long toll roads however due to the pricing no one ever took them, eventually, they became free however still due to being so far out no one took them. There was a bend in the road with overgrown grass alongside a hill which was the reason I didn't see the hazard lights on the road and they weren't far at all, slamming on the brakes I came to a halt a little way from the vehicle, and my adrenaline spiked at the sudden action I had to take as I contemplated what could have happened had my reaction been a second slower. I would have collided with the vehicle and at best very injured or worse ‚Äì a direct collision with the car. Illuminating the area with my high beams, I discerned a lone white Toyota Camry obstructing the road. Inside, there were figures slumped in their seats, with red stains on the window.

My instincts took over as I unbuckled my seat belt, opened the passenger storage compartment for first aid, and quickly placed it in the center console. Picking up my head and turning for my door I looked out into the night through the window and there briefly illuminated by the hazard lights was a dark figure hidden slightly in the brush. I paused my movement and stared waiting for the lights to flicker on again. As they did, I saw the figure looking at me tilt its head slightly, curious if it was spotted. It was pure luck I noticed; the figure crouched in the grass divider tucked by some of that thick brush. But it was close enough to notice.

My mind raced with thoughts. ‚Äú*What should I do? Should I drive off? Open the door and scream at him to leave? No, I don‚Äôt know what he has. If I don‚Äôt do something now, he‚Äôs going to make the first move.‚Äù*

A few moments went by, and I decided to open the door, I steadied my breathing while cursing myself for doing something that could get me killed. The moment I opened the door and exited I pulled out my gun from its holster and turned my weapon light to expose the figure locking in with my red dot sight. During the few seconds I had opened my door and stepped out the figure had stood up but froze the moment, I turned that beam on and placed a hand up blocking the light in his other hand I took full notice of his still dripping red liquid-stained large knife. I held my position and demanded what he wanted from me.

No verbal response was given however his actions did give a response; he made a slicing motion on his neck as he took a step forward toward me. He must have thought I had a regular flashlight because he continued to step towards me as I yelled for him to stop. I shouted as loud as I could for him to stop moving. Even though he was a decent distance away from where I was a dead sprint from his distance is still dangerous because bullets don‚Äôt stop someone immediately. When he continued to move to me slowly, methodically this was something he was well versed in doing many, many times. I shouted for him to drop the knife and by his fourth step he stopped. I think he finally took notice that what was in my hand wasn't a normal light.

The moment he ceased all movement and that granted me precious seconds of planning. From the looks of it, I could shoot this hooded figure dead and be cleared of any wrongdoing, or I could get back into the vehicle and run away and never think about this again. Another part of me just screamed for me to shoot him and end his life. Whatever bravery the hooded figure showed earlier, he certainly lost it all as the gun was reason enough to not pick this would-be prey tonight and that was good enough for me. He took a few steps back and gave me a small wave as he casually walked away. After he got further into the grass, he gently removed the hood to show a blank mask, one of those party masks you get at a party store. The white mask had noticeable red stains scattered all over the left cheek and to contrast the messy left side was just one long bloody tear coming down from the right eye slit.

After fading into the darkness, I called the police and waited for them to get there, during that time I inspected the body that was in the car, staring up into the car was a handsome young man who was holding his neck, blood splayed across his shirt and fear painted on his face. The multiple stab wounds in his chest indicated the cause of death. In the passenger‚Äôs seat was a beautiful woman who was coughing up blood reaching for the door handle gurgling still and crying in pain, whimpering at the sight of me. I heard her cries as I ran to my car and grabbed a first aid bag. I ran to the side of the car put on the emergency gloves and pulled out gauze and other first aid equipment. I opened the door and assisted her out of the car hearing her cry holding onto me as her blood pooled onto me.

I pulled her to the light of the vehicle and began first aid. She was trying to tell me something however I didn‚Äôt understand her at all. She pointed to her stomach and told me, ‚ÄúIt hurts. Scared.‚Äù She said in gurgled breaths. I tried to do everything I could to prevent the bleeding from continuing however I didn‚Äôt know how long she may have. I cut her shirt with the emergency scissors and looked at her body, the source of her bleeding was the three stab wounds to her stomach, I grabbed some of the clotting gauze and began putting it onto the knife wounds and wrapping them around her stomach as her cries of pain echoed into the night. Minutes felt like hours, and I held her there in the night as she kept crying out for help. She was holding onto my blood stand jacket as I kept her other hand on her wound putting pressure on it.

Occasionally the sound of a crunch echoed in the grassy patches to which my response was a sweep with my pistol with the light on and ready to shoot. My fear grew not only for me but the woman I now held in my arms, I was scared, not just for her as horrible as it sounds. I didn‚Äôt want to get stabbed by the masked man because that would mean certain death for both of us. My attention was stretched thin from both the sounds of the grass on the other side of the road and the young girl's moans of pain. The bleeding wouldn't stop so I had to help her the best way I knew how. Pulling more of the first aid out applying more of the gauze on her wound and pushing her into the recovery position.

I did my best to tell her to keep talking, fight through the pain, and keep telling me random facts about anything. My goal was to keep her away from death for as long as I could. The growing fear that I would be the last person on this planet to see her before she died was becoming a reality the longer I waited for the police.

All the while I kept on the lookout for the police. Finally, after what felt like a lifetime both law enforcement came alongside an ambulance, the relief of seeing those red and blue lights was unlike any other. I put my gun quickly away as I exclaimed to the woman she would be okay. I saw one of the medical personnel get out of the vehicle one quickly walk over to her, while I moved aside for them I didn't take note of who it was but one of the people grabbed me and promptly shoved me into the Camry.

It then hit me as the cold steel of the handcuffs placed on me, my mind registered it was a police officer who was now reading me my rights. As he was shouting at me, I could only stare into the shocked expression of the young man who lifelessly sat in the car in front of me. I could only recall being shoved into the car twice over and the cop screaming at me demanding 'What happened to him!? Tell me damn it.'

Finally, after what felt like what would have been another bashing, the man‚Äôs motion abruptly stopped, and a female voice asked me to explain myself as I felt the strong grip of the man loosen and drop away from my arms.

Turning my head to her I looked at the man who cuffed and slammed my head into the car, the startling realization that he looked remarkably like the young boy in the car. With tears rolling down his cheek I understood his frustration. The female officer took me and guided me to her car where we spoke of my encounter. I told her what had happened mentioning how I just saw a hooded figure walk away from me waving goodbye. She shook her head in disbelief however even if my brief explanation didn‚Äôt give them much to work it did seem to clear me of any involvement other than being the unlucky individual who stumbled upon the scene.

She said to me, ‚ÄúYou know she might make it, and it's thanks to you. You‚Äôre a hero.‚Äù I looked at her almost disgusted by the word, I was not a hero that is for sure. A hero would have done more, I did not even shoot the man responsible for it.

She wrote down my information and said she would contact me if anything came up for whatever reason they would need me. But as far as they were concerned and needed. I was free to go after an hour. I thanked them and her turning I made my way to my vehicle. Driving off I looked back at the eerie sight of the red and blue flashing lights of the EMS swallowing the hazard lights which were losing their power and fading into small faint orange lights by now.

I felt regret hit me a sort of heaviness in my chest, the thing I noticed when I was there was how in the car I noticed their phones, purses, and even his backpack inside the car were not messed with just those two individuals who were murdered. They were just prey to a monster in human skin within the Evernight, it was not a robbery gone wrong, it was just murder for the sake of murder. That experience gave me a rush I didn‚Äôt want to feel, the cold feeling of adrenaline flowing through my body as I was thrust into a fight or flight response coincided with the painful guilt. The guilt of not pulling the trigger and ending his life. That unhealthy guilt of knowing I let a monster get away into the darkness of the Evernight.",1,1729186791.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

# Share First Impressions After Unboxing the Product

When you first unbox a product, your initial reaction is crucial. It sets the tone for the rest of your Amazon FBA review. This is the moment when you see the product in its raw, untouched form, and your instincts kick in.¬†

These first impressions are often what many potential buyers are looking for when reading Amazon FBA reviews, as they offer an unfiltered, genuine reaction to the product.

# Packaging and Presentation

Your first encounter with the product will likely be its packaging. Does it look professional? Is it sleek or too bulky? How easy was it to open? If you‚Äôre reviewing a tech gadget or something fragile, was it packed securely to prevent damage during transit?

For example, imagine you‚Äôre reviewing a pair of wireless earbuds. Upon unboxing, you notice the¬†[lifestyle images](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography)¬†on Amazon showed a premium-looking product, but the actual packaging feels cheap and flimsy.¬†

This contrast between expectation and reality is vital to mention in your review. If the packaging was sturdy and well-designed, you might feel more reassured about the quality of the product itself. If not, it could plant a seed of doubt.

**Read More:**¬†[**Mastering the Balance of Infographics and Lifestyle Images In 2024**](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-the-balance-of-infographics-and-lifestyle-images-in-2024/)

# Product Aesthetics and Build Quality

Once the product is in your hands, take note of how it feels. Is it sturdy or does it feel cheaply made? This is particularly important if you‚Äôre reviewing a physical item like a smartphone case or kitchen gadget.

For example, you might unbox a leather wallet that looks luxurious in the¬†[**listing images**](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography)¬†but feels plastic-like to the touch.¬†

Here, it‚Äôs important to describe that feeling honestly, as Amazon FBA sellers often use polished marketing images to show their products in the best light. Potential buyers need the truth about what they‚Äôre really getting.

# First Functionality Test

Now that the product is unboxed and in your hands, test its basic functionality. If it‚Äôs a tech gadget, does it power on smoothly? If it‚Äôs a kitchen tool, is it easy to handle? This immediate usability test is a huge factor in first impressions.

For instance, say you‚Äôre reviewing an electric blender. You take it out of the box and plug it in, but it fails to turn on.¬†

Even though the¬†listing images¬†showed a powerful, user-friendly device, this failure would be critical in your Amazon FBA review. Likewise, if the blender works perfectly on the first try, your confidence in the product will grow.

# Quality vs. Expectation

A lot of times, we judge products based on how they were advertised in the listing images on¬†**Amazon FBA**. Were the colors, materials, and sizes accurate? This comparison between what‚Äôs promised and what‚Äôs delivered is essential for any review.

For example, if you‚Äôre unboxing a pair of shoes, did they match the size and color displayed in the listing images? If the shoes felt comfortable right out of the box, that‚Äôs a plus. But if they were too tight or the color was off, that‚Äôs definitely something to mention.

# First Impressions Influence Final Review

The first few moments after unboxing can heavily influence your overall opinion of a product. While it‚Äôs important to thoroughly test and use the item before finalizing your review, your initial reaction can‚Äôt be ignored.¬†

Potential buyers reading your¬†[**Amazon FBA**](https://www.amzonestep.com/)¬†review are looking for those honest first thoughts to help guide their purchase decisions.

In the long run, your first impression can either set the product up for success or raise concerns. For example, a well-packaged product with thoughtful design and functionality will likely lead to a positive overall review. Conversely, if your first impression was poor, it might make you more critical during your full evaluation.

# Example: Reviewing a Fitness Tracker

You purchase a fitness tracker from Amazon FBA, and based on the listing images, you expect it to be lightweight, sleek, and user-friendly. Upon unboxing, you find that while it does look good, the band feels too stiff, and the display isn‚Äôt as bright as shown in the¬†listing images.

Your first impressions might be something like: ‚ÄúThe tracker looks stylish and modern, but the band is a bit uncomfortable, and the screen is duller than expected. I‚Äôm curious to see how it performs during workouts.‚Äù

# Discuss How the Product Solved a Specific Problem

Writing about a product to solve some problem should start by stating what problem you‚Äôre trying to handle and how you feel when you encounter that problem. For instance, if you had bought a laptop cooling pad because your gadget heats up and then slugs when you worked on it for more than four hours, state so.¬†

You should then state how the cooling pad solved the heating issue after use, thus enabling you to work longer with no disturbances. That makes it relatable by adding that personal touch to the product and showing the practical benefits likely to be derived from it in action.

**Example:**

‚ÄúMy laptop used to overheat within an hour of work, causing serious slowing down. I bought this laptop cooler from Amazon FBA, and the difference was immediate. It kept my gadget cool due to the fans, enabling me to work for hours without any hiccups in its performance.

¬†While the product‚Äôs[¬†main image](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-optimize-your-amazon-products-main-image/)¬†viewed at the Amazon listing was sleek, what mattered more was the efficiency with which it managed to resolve the problem of overheating. My work days seem much smoother now, with a high-performing laptop.‚Äù

This will give it more meaning to the buyer than images shown in a listing when one is able to show how a product solves an existing problem in life.

# Add Photos or Videos for Visual Feedback

# Show Product Usage in Action

This will give fantastic visual feedback, showing how the product works in real-time. Suppose you have been asked to review some kitchen appliances. You could just tell that it works great, but even better would be taking a video of your cooking lunch with it. Users will appreciate seeing for themselves just how intuitive and efficient the product is. This is also a good way, if you are managing your products via¬†[**Amazon FBA**](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-beginners-can-expect-from-amazon-fba/), to show the products you are selling and exactly how they meet customer‚Äôs needs.

# Comparing Products with Photos

You can use side-by-side comparison shots if you are reviewing a product and comparing it with another. This works great for¬†listing images, especially in competitive categories.¬†

For example, when reviewing a pair of running shoes, you might picture the new shoes next to any other pair you have previously used, showing the differences in build quality, design, or comfort.

# Use Before-and-After Photos for Effectiveness

* Before-and-after shots work fantastic for beauty or cleaning products that you sell on Amazon FBA. For instance, if you are reviewing some teeth-whitening kit, show what your teeth looked like before and what they looked like after using the product for a week. This adds a bit more credibility to your review, as it shows the timeline of the effectiveness of the product.

# Highlight Key Product Features in Images

You can do this by highlighting the key features of the product with the help of detailed photos. If you have bought a multi-functional backpack, then you may shoot individual shots of its different compartments and show how much it can hold.¬†

For FBA sellers, this is a great opportunity to clear off most of their customer doubts as buyers on Amazon get a clear view of the product.

# Make Short Video Tutorials

Short video tutorials go a long way in explaining products that may require some explanation. If the product requires assembling, then record yourself assembling it step by step. You do not need professional editing software; even a smartphone video can go a long way in helping future buyers.

The same technique helps¬†Amazon FBA¬†sellers show how easy their products are, or how intuitive.

# Capture Close-ups for Quality Assurance

This is especially true in cases of product review that require a closer inspection of the craftsmanship, such as watches or jewelry; close-up shots will guarantee the prospects about their quality. Shoot with a high-resolution camera or get these shots using your smartphone‚Äôs macro feature.

Close-up¬†listing images¬†in reviews can turn into a major differentiator, and more so for¬†Amazon FBA¬†sellers looking to push high-quality products.

# Show Real-World Application

* Take it out of the box, and use it in its natural environment. If it is a camping product, then go for a hike and take pictures of how well this or that performs. It gives more weight to your review to see how it works in real-life situations and provides confidence for potential customers in their purchase decisions.¬†[Amazon FBA sellers](https://www.amzonestep.com/)¬†can use this feedback in their listing to help convince potential buyers.

# Use Creative Angles

Sometimes, it is not the quantity of the photos but how creative you get with it. Take a product, say a furniture item, and shoot it from different angles to show how it would fit in a room.¬†

This is quite useful for Amazon FBA sellers in terms of showing what the product would look like in many other real-life settings when trying to entice a customer.

# Compare the Product with Alternatives You‚Äôve Tried

When it comes to purchasing decisions on Amazon, comparing the product with alternatives you‚Äôve tried is an effective way to provide meaningful reviews. Whether you‚Äôre reviewing gadgets, clothes, or household items, sharing your experiences with different products can guide potential buyers.¬†

Here‚Äôs how you can craft a detailed comparison, especially focusing on Amazon FBA products, listing images, and key features that stand out.

# Example 1: Fitness Tracker Comparison

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre reviewing a fitness tracker that you purchased through Amazon FBA. In your review, you can compare it with another tracker you‚Äôve used in the past.

**For instance:**

* ‚ÄúI‚Äôve used both the XYZ Fitness Tracker and the ABC Fitness Tracker. While the XYZ offers basic tracking features like steps and calories, I found that the ABC has a far superior battery life and more accurate heart rate monitoring. However, what made me lean toward the XYZ Fitness Tracker was its sleek design, which looked much better in¬†listing images¬†compared to the ABC tracker, and it arrived faster, thanks to Amazon FBA.‚Äù

This type of comparison allows you to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of both products, offering a balanced perspective for potential customers.

# Example 2: Comparing Kitchen Appliances

Another example could be a review of a coffee maker. Suppose you‚Äôve recently bought a coffee maker from¬†Amazon FBA¬†but have also used a similar product in the past.

**Here‚Äôs a sample review:**

‚ÄúThe DEF Coffee Maker, which I ordered through Amazon FBA, arrived within two days and was packaged well. In comparison to the GHI Coffee Maker I previously owned, the DEF model heats up much faster and has more intuitive controls. However, the GHI Coffee Maker produced slightly richer-tasting coffee. Additionally, the listing images for the DEF model didn‚Äôt fully capture its size, which was smaller than expected.‚Äù

Here, the customer would benefit from knowing the performance and visual differences between the two coffee makers, helping them make an informed decision.

# Comment on Value for Money and Overall Satisfaction

The majority of Amazon customers scrutinize a detailed review about a product‚Äôs value for money and its overall satisfaction.

¬†In this way, customers can identify whether the item will be worth their investment or not, especially when customers depend upon the listing images with descriptions to make their selection. Now, how will you go about breaking this important reviewing component?.

# Price to Quality Ratio Evaluation

One of the things you would want to know first is whether the product lives up to expectations for its price. Take, for instance, a high-end blender costing $100. For a high-end blender, is its performance unmatched compared with other blenders in the market?¬†

Did it arrive as advertised in pictures from the listing? You would compare your expectations with actual performance to decide whether or not you are getting value.

* For instance, take an¬†[Amazon seller](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesagencycouncil/2023/02/15/how-to-step-up-your-game-as-an-amazon-seller-in-2023/)¬†who is selling through Amazon FBA a gadget that sells for a higher price compared to other similar ones. If it is actually much stronger in build quality and works the way it should, you can show how much the price reflects that; however, if not, your review should note that it may not provide the best value as opposed to other choices.

# Comparing with Competitors

Other ways of offering value-for-money insights would be discussing how the item stacks up against other competitors. If you have tried similar items, you can pinpoint why this particular one stood out from the rest.¬†

* Example: ‚ÄúThe ones that I had purchased from other wireless headphones were less than half as good in terms of sound quality for the money. The clarity and battery life are just like it was advertised in the listing images, which for a solid $50, is actually a decent deal.

Let me put it this way: reviews like these can considerably help an¬†Amazon FBA¬†seller, much so when they can underline something that differentiates their product from its competition or makes it superior in functionality.

# Sharing Durability and Longevity Insights

Long-term satisfaction with a product will often relate to how well the product lasts. A durable item that holds up over time will add a great deal of value. If you have purchased a backpack that looks brand new after a year of extreme use, make sure to mention it.¬†

You can explain how the product‚Äôs longevity adds value to owning the product, especially if it is indicative of the quality shown in the¬†listing images**.**

With¬†Amazon FBA, many of the products might ship out fast and look great when they actually get here, but it is the durability that really shows if they are worth the price over a long period of time.

# Highlighting Versatility and Functionality

If it‚Äôs added value that the product can serve several functions, be sure to mention this in your review. Example: ‚ÄúI love how this blender works for smoothies, soups, and even grinding coffee beans. It‚Äôs truly a multipurpose gadget worth every penny of its $150 price tag.‚Äù

While¬†[**Amazon FBA**](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-use-amazon-sales-estimator-to-find-amazon-fba-potential/)¬†sellers might indicate such versatility with detailed listing images, your experience as a user adds a level of credibility and insight for potential buyers.

Lastly, comment on whether the product lived up to your expectations or even went above and beyond them. Was this product a convenience, a great thing to have, to bring you happiness or ease in your life?¬†

This overall satisfaction will affect if this was a good purchase. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy with this purchase! The product came exactly as shown in the images from the listing and performed even better than expected.‚Äù

**Example of Real-World Review**

Let us give you an example: You purchased a portable Bluetooth speaker from an Amazon seller who used¬†[Amazon FBA](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-premium-ebc-enhance-brand-content-improves-amazon-fba-strategy/). You can write in your review something like this:

* This Bluetooth speaker sounds crystal clear, hits hard bass notes, and looks just like the listing images, worth every dollar of that 75 bucks I spent. I have used it at parties, and outdoor gatherings; this thing has never let me down. It holds a charge for hours, and I have dropped it a few times while drunk with no issues. Overall, I feel that with this speaker, I get incredible value for my money, and wouldn‚Äôt hesitate once to buy from this Amazon FBA seller again.

# How to Keep Your Reviews Balanced and Honest on Amazon

# Encourage Genuine Feedback

To foster honest reviews, encourage customers to share their genuine experiences. After a purchase, follow up with a polite email requesting feedback. For example, you might say, ‚ÄúWe hope you‚Äôre enjoying your new product!¬†

We would appreciate it if you could take a moment to share your thoughts.‚Äù This approach shows you value their opinion and are open to constructive criticism.

# Use Incentives Wisely

* While incentivizing reviews can be effective, it is crucial to do it ethically. Offering discounts on future purchases or entry into a giveaway can encourage feedback without compromising honesty. For instance, you could say, ‚ÄúLeave an honest review for a chance to win a $50 gift card!‚Äù This method promotes balanced reviews without pressuring customers to leave only positive feedback.

# Highlight Specific Features

When requesting reviews, ask customers to comment on specific features of your product. For example, if you sell kitchen gadgets, prompt them to discuss ease of use, effectiveness, or design. This guidance helps ensure that reviews cover various aspects, contributing to a more balanced perspective.

# Address Negative Reviews Gracefully

Negative reviews can be an opportunity for growth. When you receive constructive criticism, respond professionally and thank the reviewer for their feedback.¬†

This not only shows potential customers that you care but also encourages more honest reviews in the future. For instance, a response like, ‚ÄúThank you for your feedback! We are continuously working to improve and appreciate your insights,‚Äù can foster trust.

# Leverage Listing Images to Set Expectations

Incorporate high-quality¬†[product images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-are-tips-for-amazon-fba-scroll-stopping-product-images/)¬†that accurately represent your product. Clear visuals help set realistic expectations, making it less likely that customers will leave¬†[negative feedback](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-remove-negative-feedback-on-amazon/)¬†due to misunderstanding.

For example, if a product has specific dimensions, show it alongside everyday items for scale. This helps customers visualize the product accurately.

# Share Your Story

Authenticity resonates with buyers. Share your journey as a seller and your passion for the product. When customers understand the effort behind the product, they may feel more inclined to leave balanced reviews.¬†

For instance, a brief story about why you started your business can foster a connection with potential buyers.

# Engage with Customers Post-Purchase

Engaging with customers after their purchase can encourage reviews. Send a personalized message thanking them for their purchase and inviting them to share their thoughts.

For example, ‚ÄúWe hope you are loving your new \[product name\]. Your feedback means the world to us!‚Äù This shows you value their opinion and promotes honest reviews.

# Monitor and Analyze Feedback

Regularly monitor reviews to identify trends or recurring issues. If multiple customers mention a specific flaw, address it in future product iterations. By demonstrating that you listen to feedback, you encourage more balanced reviews.¬†

For instance, if customers mention that your product could use clearer instructions, consider adding an instructional video to your¬†listing images**.**

# Utilize Amazon FBA to Enhance Customer Experience

Amazon FBA¬†can significantly enhance the customer experience by ensuring timely deliveries and hassle-free returns. A smooth shopping experience often translates into positive and balanced reviews. Ensure that your products are well-packaged and arrive in excellent condition, as this reflects on your brand‚Äôs commitment to quality.

# Celebrate Your Reviewers

Highlighting positive reviews can encourage others to leave feedback. Feature some of your best reviews in your marketing materials or on your social media platforms. For example, share a customer‚Äôs testimonial that praises your product‚Äôs quality and effectiveness.¬†

This recognition not only encourages others to leave reviews but also builds a sense of community around your brand.",1,1729186785.0,u_amzonestepusa,0,1.0,False

Does anyone know if these houses were constructed by reputable local builders or if they were just put up quickly without much attention to quality?

I'm also curious about the general atmosphere in the area. Is it safe for walking and running? Are there nearby parks or green spaces where people like to spend time outdoors? Additionally, I'd love to hear about the local coffee shops, dining options, and other amenities. Are there any standout places to grab a bite or relax with a coffee, or is it more of a quiet residential area?

The first time it was returned after replacing ""the power box"". Not surprisingly the coffee was still weak and pucks crumbly and thin. I returned it two weeks later stating the same issue and after not hearing back contacted Jura for an update on the repair status. I was told it was waiting on a back-ordered PCB. So I asked if they really thought electronics was the issue and not the grinder or brew group. When the representative (who said they had also worked in the service area for years) responded that is what the diagnostic program is telling them. Then came the turning point. I stated I am skeptical that this is the issue, unless it has to do with pressure, dosing, or something directly related to brewing the coffee, and asked if they run a few cups of coffee to make sure that was it correct? Then the bomb shell dropped.....No we NEVER make coffee when it is in for service. We rely on the sophisticated diagnostic software to ""Virtually"" run the machine and tell us what is wrong. Wait, what? So you never actually run the machine to make sure it is making decent coffee? No sir, that would take too much time and cleaning. I'm speechless.

1g5wkfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g5wkfw/the_backroads_the_masked_lurker/,The Backroads: The Masked Lurker,"Thinking about things you shouldn‚Äôt is an established trait among humans, whether we developed that horrid trait through evolution or it just being a part of us that we always had I don‚Äôt know but I hate it. It sucks and it sucks more when you need just to let go of those certain events however on the road trapped in the Evernight it‚Äôs an impossibility. One does not simply erase horrors from the mind no matter how hard they try but luckily you can distract yourself, you can let your mind wander while driving for hours in the dark. My routine would consist of podcasts blasting music like a sane person, the one thing I‚Äôd recommend is to not fuel that burning desire to dwell on those bad thoughts or memories. Don‚Äôt be stupid and listen to horror videos or true crime podcasts. Don‚Äôt listen to that conspiracy theorist who has his radio station and has the southern voice that draws you in for it will only bring you to contemplate the strange happenings in your neck of the woods, along with the healthy dose distrust with the government staples of the country. Not that his points aren't entirely wrong but most people rather live in bliss. Don‚Äôt listen and think about the creepy shit on the radio, podcast, whatever just leave it as background noise believe me when I say the allure of horror should be kept to fiction as inviting into your life is never a clever idea. And for the love of God and all that is holy don‚Äôt fucking text and drive.

Now you might be wondering ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt I think about the creepy shit or bad memories in my life?‚Äô and my answer should be obvious, it‚Äôs creepy shit at night I don‚Äôt care about how brave or edgy you think you are. Out in the dark, that type of vibe can invite things to you, things that look human but well aren‚Äôt. This was made clear to me that my thoughts out at night can both influence and attract certain entities to someone‚Äôs location, some of these beings may be beneficial and can be extremely dangerous. You might ask how some can be beneficial to you. Well from what I‚Äôve heard there are helpful entities that grant people who might come across them with money, treasures, or a sense of peace. Others don‚Äôt do anything remotely close to beneficial but aren‚Äôt exactly out to cause chaos to unfold they just more or less linger in the limbo of the Evernight. The best description I can utilize for them is in the simplest terms, weird. Events that occur be it creepy or riding on the side of weird stupid shit, for instance, there are odd occurrences, like a clown car honking its horn three times, where one of the passengers grants you a sight of a full moon on a clouded night - a peculiar incident, to say the least.

You may think to yourself ‚ÄòOh I‚Äôm fine, it‚Äôs just creepy clowns at night.‚Äô Yeah, many people thought the same thing back in the late 2010s and that ended up with people dead so good luck with that mentality. See in the Evernight you should have at least two rules with you encounter horrifying shit. The first option is to run like hell, or rather drive like a bat out of hell. The second and the riskier is to grab your gat and hold it sideways and explain why this bitch done fucked up. That‚Äôs assuming you have a Glock lying about inside of your car and you can hit while holding sideways. If not plan three seems to work best for some of my fellow contracted coworkers from the various parts of the great United States. Shoot and drive.

I listed the options above as such because when it comes down to it you must either fight or run. And I always say when you choose to run there is no shame in that. You‚Äôre a regular person after all not the protagonist in a novel. When it comes down to decisions you need to value your life and not play stupid games. I also give out these options because you want to learn from others, or you can be like my coworker. He told me about his time driving in the Evernight while I was still under his tutelage, he spoke to me often of his crazy experiences, and although he was extremely inebriated along with smoking way more pot than a den dedicated to growing marijuana. I listened and took away lessons from him. And before you question why he was, I don‚Äôt know why he decided to info dump his hellish stories unto me but there were plenty of bat shit tales that he experienced which most likely led to his current state however being the kind person I am, I leant him my ear. Besides when driving for nearly 12 hours a night having someone ramble about their time working the job you are taking over helps immensely for the first weeks on the job. I‚Äôm more than positive he was a sober great individual, but that person was long gone and the man I had sitting next to me was nothing more than a shell who only functioned from strong booze and somehow managed to drive sober enough to get to his destination. It was enough to keep his employment but of course, it wasn‚Äôt for long.

I made mistakes of dwelling on the terrible memories I made throughout my trips, and I allowed myself to let the supernatural influence my mind while driving and it caused stress like no other. By this point in my life, I learned that the supernatural is very much real and you should at the bare minimum give it the respect it deserves. Don‚Äôt misinterpret what I say next. When you do night drives for as long as I have, no matter the main road, or the backroads you will have an experience that will be seared into your mind or several, and you should treat it with some kind of respect. Not saying you should give a supernatural entity polite speech or anything like that. What I mean is if you encounter a monster, you treat the situation with some actual brain power and deal with it accordingly. For example, if you see a creature that resembles a human stand up screeching in the road within your headlights. You shouldn‚Äôt pull your phone out and film it and hope the cameraman rule applies to you, life is not a movie, and it may not send a saving grace to protect you in the moment that does happen.

Oh yeah, I forgot my old coworker's story, this one isn't necessarily supernatural at least I don't think it is true, but you can consider it an example of what I told you above, you should not put bad thoughts into the world, because the world may respond equally.

I remember he told me a story, on one of his travels he spotted a woman running from the wilderness into the main road and he stopped for her. Her face was that of a gorgeous model and she wore a beautiful white dress. He thought ‚ÄúScore.‚Äù At first and rolled his window down asking where she needed to go. He was told she needed just to get to the next town as fast as possible so that her husband wouldn‚Äôt find her and to at least take her to the hospital.

He was asking what happened to her as she got into his vehicle, and she explained to him that she was beaten by him countless times and she finally mustered up the courage to leave him. She fled with a friend who she trusted and when her husband found her, he beat her and the friend up and shot his friend. She ran away and got a ride from an Uber, but the Uber wouldn‚Äôt take her that far after they were shot at, so she fled down the road and into the wilderness. Feeling horrible for her he sped off telling her she‚Äôd be fine and that she would be taken to the hospital and the police notified.

During this trip she was asking questions and began to get sexual with him, she was being overly flirtatious and despite his better judgment, he let his little brain get the better of him. While they started getting a little busy, he had undone her dress only to discover that she had bullet wounds and stab wounds in her stomach. When he saw this the woman grew angry, she began screeching while grasping at his throat. Screaming he tried getting her off and out of the vehicle only to wake up in the truck alone on the side of the road parked. The only thing he had was the scent of her lingering and the blood still all over his clothes, driving away he shuddered in fear.

That was the story I remembered on one of my trips it was a Friday night. I got my coffee and grabbed my keys to pack up the vehicle they provided me at this old military building that was repurposed for whatever the company uses it for now. I was told to take the supplies they had ready to another contractor in a city a few hours up and come back with some supplies they had in their vehicle. The job was simple, swap the goods and get back down. If anything, else was required they would inform me through text and send me. Simple enough, normal stuff everything that this company takes always goes back to this lab up in a big city and we are sent to collect the items or trade whatever essentially, we are mostly contract couriers. The job was as simple as they come and so I made my way to grab what I needed to form the hospital as directed.

I soon began my long drive into the endless blackness of the Evernight with nothing but the destination in mind. I drove on with music playing and thoughts of ‚Äòwhat horrors may come to play tonight‚Äô. That was the wrong thought because that was the day, I witnessed the first untimely deaths on the road. My mind was racing at the story my coworker told me before I was a free man doing these jobs on my own. It wasn't creepy but I wouldn't know what to do in that situation, not the horny woman in the car. But if someone was riding with me and suddenly attacked me or met someone on the side of the road who needed my help.

As for my story, I vividly remember that night‚Äîit was 2337 I was going about 87 miles an hour on the empty backroads. They were considered to be the new long toll roads however due to the pricing no one ever took them, eventually, they became free however still due to being so far out no one took them. There was a bend in the road with overgrown grass alongside a hill which was the reason I didn't see the hazard lights on the road and they weren't far at all, slamming on the brakes I came to a halt a little way from the vehicle, and my adrenaline spiked at the sudden action I had to take as I contemplated what could have happened had my reaction been a second slower. I would have collided with the vehicle and at best very injured or worse ‚Äì a direct collision with the car. Illuminating the area with my high beams, I discerned a lone white Toyota Camry obstructing the road. Inside, there were figures slumped in their seats, with red stains on the window.

My instincts took over as I unbuckled my seat belt, opened the passenger storage compartment for first aid, and quickly placed it in the center console. Picking up my head and turning for my door I looked out into the night through the window and there briefly illuminated by the hazard lights was a dark figure hidden slightly in the brush. I paused my movement and stared waiting for the lights to flicker on again. As they did, I saw the figure looking at me tilt its head slightly, curious if it was spotted. It was pure luck I noticed; the figure crouched in the grass divider tucked by some of that thick brush. But it was close enough to notice.

My mind raced with thoughts. ‚Äú*What should I do? Should I drive off? Open the door and scream at him to leave? No, I don‚Äôt know what he has. If I don‚Äôt do something now, he‚Äôs going to make the first move.‚Äù*

A few moments went by, and I decided to open the door, I steadied my breathing while cursing myself for doing something that could get me killed. The moment I opened the door and exited I pulled out my gun from its holster and turned my weapon light to expose the figure locking in with my red dot sight. During the few seconds I had opened my door and stepped out the figure had stood up but froze the moment, I turned that beam on and placed a hand up blocking the light in his other hand I took full notice of his still dripping red liquid-stained large knife. I held my position and demanded what he wanted from me.

No verbal response was given however his actions did give a response; he made a slicing motion on his neck as he took a step forward toward me. He must have thought I had a regular flashlight because he continued to step towards me as I yelled for him to stop. I shouted as loud as I could for him to stop moving. Even though he was a decent distance away from where I was a dead sprint from his distance is still dangerous because bullets don‚Äôt stop someone immediately. When he continued to move to me slowly, methodically this was something he was well versed in doing many, many times. I shouted for him to drop the knife and by his fourth step he stopped. I think he finally took notice that what was in my hand wasn't a normal light.

The moment he ceased all movement and that granted me precious seconds of planning. From the looks of it, I could shoot this hooded figure dead and be cleared of any wrongdoing, or I could get back into the vehicle and run away and never think about this again. Another part of me just screamed for me to shoot him and end his life. Whatever bravery the hooded figure showed earlier, he certainly lost it all as the gun was reason enough to not pick this would-be prey tonight and that was good enough for me. He took a few steps back and gave me a small wave as he casually walked away. After he got further into the grass, he gently removed the hood to show a blank mask, one of those party masks you get at a party store. The white mask had noticeable red stains scattered all over the left cheek and to contrast the messy left side was just one long bloody tear coming down from the right eye slit.

After fading into the darkness, I called the police and waited for them to get there, during that time I inspected the body that was in the car, staring up into the car was a handsome young man who was holding his neck, blood splayed across his shirt and fear painted on his face. The multiple stab wounds in his chest indicated the cause of death. In the passenger‚Äôs seat was a beautiful woman who was coughing up blood reaching for the door handle gurgling still and crying in pain, whimpering at the sight of me. I heard her cries as I ran to my car and grabbed a first aid bag. I ran to the side of the car put on the emergency gloves and pulled out gauze and other first aid equipment. I opened the door and assisted her out of the car hearing her cry holding onto me as her blood pooled onto me.

I pulled her to the light of the vehicle and began first aid. She was trying to tell me something however I didn‚Äôt understand her at all. She pointed to her stomach and told me, ‚ÄúIt hurts. Scared.‚Äù She said in gurgled breaths. I tried to do everything I could to prevent the bleeding from continuing however I didn‚Äôt know how long she may have. I cut her shirt with the emergency scissors and looked at her body, the source of her bleeding was the three stab wounds to her stomach, I grabbed some of the clotting gauze and began putting it onto the knife wounds and wrapping them around her stomach as her cries of pain echoed into the night. Minutes felt like hours, and I held her there in the night as she kept crying out for help. She was holding onto my blood stand jacket as I kept her other hand on her wound putting pressure on it.

Occasionally the sound of a crunch echoed in the grassy patches to which my response was a sweep with my pistol with the light on and ready to shoot. My fear grew not only for me but the woman I now held in my arms, I was scared, not just for her as horrible as it sounds. I didn‚Äôt want to get stabbed by the masked man because that would mean certain death for both of us. My attention was stretched thin from both the sounds of the grass on the other side of the road and the young girl's moans of pain. The bleeding wouldn't stop so I had to help her the best way I knew how. Pulling more of the first aid out applying more of the gauze on her wound and pushing her into the recovery position.

I did my best to tell her to keep talking, fight through the pain, and keep telling me random facts about anything. My goal was to keep her away from death for as long as I could. The growing fear that I would be the last person on this planet to see her before she died was becoming a reality the longer I waited for the police.

All the while I kept on the lookout for the police. Finally, after what felt like a lifetime both law enforcement came alongside an ambulance, the relief of seeing those red and blue lights was unlike any other. I put my gun quickly away as I exclaimed to the woman she would be okay. I saw one of the medical personnel get out of the vehicle one quickly walk over to her, while I moved aside for them I didn't take note of who it was but one of the people grabbed me and promptly shoved me into the Camry.

It then hit me as the cold steel of the handcuffs placed on me, my mind registered it was a police officer who was now reading me my rights. As he was shouting at me, I could only stare into the shocked expression of the young man who lifelessly sat in the car in front of me. I could only recall being shoved into the car twice over and the cop screaming at me demanding 'What happened to him!? Tell me damn it.'

Finally, after what felt like what would have been another bashing, the man‚Äôs motion abruptly stopped, and a female voice asked me to explain myself as I felt the strong grip of the man loosen and drop away from my arms.

Turning my head to her I looked at the man who cuffed and slammed my head into the car, the startling realization that he looked remarkably like the young boy in the car. With tears rolling down his cheek I understood his frustration. The female officer took me and guided me to her car where we spoke of my encounter. I told her what had happened mentioning how I just saw a hooded figure walk away from me waving goodbye. She shook her head in disbelief however even if my brief explanation didn‚Äôt give them much to work it did seem to clear me of any involvement other than being the unlucky individual who stumbled upon the scene.

She said to me, ‚ÄúYou know she might make it, and it's thanks to you. You‚Äôre a hero.‚Äù I looked at her almost disgusted by the word, I was not a hero that is for sure. A hero would have done more, I did not even shoot the man responsible for it.

She wrote down my information and said she would contact me if anything came up for whatever reason they would need me. But as far as they were concerned and needed. I was free to go after an hour. I thanked them and her turning I made my way to my vehicle. Driving off I looked back at the eerie sight of the red and blue flashing lights of the EMS swallowing the hazard lights which were losing their power and fading into small faint orange lights by now.

I felt regret hit me a sort of heaviness in my chest, the thing I noticed when I was there was how in the car I noticed their phones, purses, and even his backpack inside the car were not messed with just those two individuals who were murdered. They were just prey to a monster in human skin within the Evernight, it was not a robbery gone wrong, it was just murder for the sake of murder. That experience gave me a rush I didn‚Äôt want to feel, the cold feeling of adrenaline flowing through my body as I was thrust into a fight or flight response coincided with the painful guilt. The guilt of not pulling the trigger and ending his life. That unhealthy guilt of knowing I let a monster get away into the darkness of the Evernight.",0,1729186593.0,nosleep,1,0.5,False
1g5wkbp,https://i.redd.it/tjqr9abircvd1.jpeg,Vancouver Island & Seattle Whiskey,"Visited my sister in law and her family on Vancouver Island and made sure to hit up plenty of distilleries along the way. 

The Strath Ale Wine & Liquor Merchants: a boutique liquor shop in Victoria that had way too many exciting things and I had too little time to explore. Spoke with a few employees for a while including the owner Adam and was able to try a few of their store picks including a cask strength Benromach (delicious) as well as the bottle I ended up taking home, Stillhead‚Äôs 100% BC rye finished in a PX cask ‚ÄòThe Iberian Cascadian‚Äô that just won ‚ÄúBest Single Cask Whiskey‚Äù and ‚ÄúBest Cask Strength Whiskey‚Äù at the Canadian Whiskey Awards 2024. Honestly wish I had like two more hours to hang here as they have a huge selection that also includes SMWS bottles. Highly recommend a visit here if ever in Victoria. Also left with a 50ml of Glenfarclas 15.

Devine Distillery: Unfortunately these guys are closing their operation at the end of the year, but we visited and took advantage of their 25% off everything sale. I picked up their Ancient Grains quarter cask which has a mashbill of barley, spelt, emmer, khorosan and einkorn. As a baker this really intrigued me and am looking forward to trying it. My brother in law took home their double oaked single malt which we drank together and it was really delicious. Sweet and oaky. Thanks for the recommendation Adam. Also, if you do get out there before the end of the year, the location is ridiculously beautiful and a stones throw from Bouchard Gardens.

Shelter Point Distillery: A beautifully situated farm distillery on the coast in Oyster River, BC that makes single malts and now rye. Enjoyed a tasting and left with their Cask Strength Single Malt. Other highlights were their Ripple Rock expression (aged in alligator charred new oak) and their Smoke Point (aged in ex peated islay barrels.)

Wayward Distillery: Small distillery in Courtenay, BC that specializes in spirits distilled from and/or infused with local honey. Tried everyything they make (complimentary tastings!) including their Raspberry Gin but left with bottles of Krupnik spiced honey liquor and their coffee and cocoa bean infused vodka called Depth Charge. Really unique spot - the Krupnik is going to be awesome for the holidays. 

Copperworks Distillery: Flying out of Seattle to head home I only had one day in town (and Westland was closed unfortunately) so I decided to check out Copperworks. They are founded by beer lovers and brewers and you can taste it in their product. They have a long fermentation and also cold lager their wash before distilling. I got a distinct craft beer taste in all their offerings that make them a unique pour. I left with their Farmsmith expression which features a single varietal of barley developed by WSU bread lab and grown all on one farm from one season in Washington. Nose was extremely butterscotch and sweet with the palate following suit but adding more complexity. 

Other Pickups: Was hoping to be able to visit Macaloney‚Äôs Distillery but timing didn‚Äôt work so I took home a tasting pack I found in a local store. Also found a 375 from Odd Society in Vancouver called Community that is distilled from a double ipa from Bomber Brewing.

This trip thoroughly disproved the rumor that Canadian Whiskey is subpar - you might just have to visit to find the good ones.",1,1729186584.0,whiskey,0,0.67,False
1g5wk7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g5wk7r/father_michael/,Father Michael,"I love being a teacher. Waking up every morning and seeing all my students is the highlight of my days. Each student is very different from one another, and I'm not going to lie, there are certain students I do favor over the others. I have one student with whom I bond the most. She always arrives to class on time and looks very put together. She doesn't wear baggy hoodies and pajamas like the other kids. Her hair always falls perfectly with her curls neatly tamed. She always says thank you and tells me to have a good day at the end of each class. Heather is just a role model student. Every teacher wishes for students like her.

Today I went to the teacher's lounge like every other day to eat lunch. I switched who I sat with very frequently because they all tend to get boring fast. Today I sat with Mrs. Crow, a young, newer teacher. She began talking to me about how she's engaged and showing me pictures of her fianc√©.¬†

""Are you seeing anyone,"" she asked

""No.‚Äù I responded not trying to entertain this conversation.

She leans towards me touching my shoulder. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I'm sure you'll meet someone soon. When you know, you know, or at least that's what happened with my boyfriend, I mean fiance.‚Äù she said, letting out an obnoxious laugh.

‚ÄúHave you been in any recent relationships? Sorry I'm just so nosey! Just excited to get to know my new co-workers.‚Äù she said while playfully punching my shoulder.

‚ÄúI was married, but things didn't end very well after she cheated on me.‚Äù I responded, unsure why I told her that.

‚ÄúOh my god. I'm so sorry!‚Äù she responds while covering her mouth with her hands.

After she let me get a few words in she continued talking about herself. I sat there pretending to listen while reminiscing about my past relationship while it's now on my mind. I started to feel myself getting angry, then I remembered some coping techniques I learned from my support group. I got up and walked away trying to contain myself from saying something I'll regret.¬†

After school a few students stayed to make up a quiz. I always bring snacks and drinks for the students, I find it helps them do better. After about 30 minutes, there was only one student left.

""Are you sure you don't want some soda? It's the last one left."" I asked while reaching for the sprite.

""I guess it won't hurt,"" she responded.

I cracked open the soda and slipped a pill in there while she was too focused to notice. I hand her the soda and she continues working.

""Already I'm all done.‚Äù

I grabbed her quiz while I asked ‚Äú You were absent Tuesday, right?‚Äù She nods her head yes.

I walk towards my desk pretending to look for the graded quizzes.

""It looks like I left them in my car. I could give it to you if you don't mind walking there with me?""

""Sure. I've got nowhere else to be."" She exclaimed.

We step out of the classroom and start heading towards the side door. I look down at her, and see the top of her head with her bunny hair clips, barely reaching my shoulders. She's so cute and small, I just wanna pick her up. We finally reach my car and I unlock the door. I open the door and ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù drop my keys.

""They're right on the seat If you want to start looking for your quiz,"" I stated while bending down to grab the keys.

As she reaches into the car I push her as hard as I can. Her backpack flips over her head forcing her into my car. Am I really doing this right now? At school? I slammed the door and drove away as quickly as possible. She started to yell and bange on the windows. Thank god for my investment into tinted windows. She started reaching up towards me and covering my eyes. I grabbed my coffee mug and hit her in the head. I didn't want to hurt her, but she left me no choice. After about 10 minutes of me fighting with her while trying to drive at the same time, she finally collapsed onto her side.

I pull into my garage and think about how to get her inside. I guess I could just carry her. She's small, right? I step inside to make sure there's no one home.

""Hello?"" I asked

""Hey, how was work?"" my sister responded.

""Really good,"" I responded, not trying to show my panic.

""I've just got a lot of work to do. I'll be downstairs.""

‚ÄúDo you have your group meeting tonight?‚Äù she asked

‚ÄúNo, tomorrow morning I think.‚Äù I responded while trying to sit Heather up.

I finally get a good grip on her and slowly carry her through the garage door and down the basement stairs. I‚Äôve done something similar to this before, but I still couldn't help stressing. My sister never comes down here because this is technically my part of the house. I pay for the basement, and she knows I don't like when people mess with my stuff. I always lock the door and she just never bothers me. It's kind of an unspoken agreement we have.

I gently place Heather on the floor. She's so pretty when she's sleeping. I go into my workshop and grab an old chain and lock I've had. I don't want to do this Heather, but I have to, at least until I can explain what she's done wrong. I sit on the couch and accidentally doze off.

I finally wake up after about what felt like 5 hours and look over to the floor, she's still lying there. I checked my phone and it's been almost an hour. When will she wake up? She's been passed out for over two hours now. I didn't think it‚Äôd last this long. My stress has been getting in the way of my excitement, but I'm eager now. I can't wait to see her journey. The basement of my house isn‚Äôt very nice, but I hope she won't mind. I have a special surprise for her. There's one other room down here and I've spent almost a whole year renovating. I didn't know I'd be getting it ready for her at first, but as time went on I realized how perfect she'd be to bring to Father Michael. I tore out the wooden panel walls and painted them pink. All girls like pink. I hope she likes it. I remember this one shirt that Heather would wear often. It was skin-tight with a little bunny on the right side. Sometimes when she‚Äôd stretch in class her shirt would roll up and I could see her belly piercing poking out. I bought her a bunny stuffed animal because of this shirt. I hope she likes that too. I lay on the couch impatiently, thinking about how excited she's gonna be for my surprise. As I'm laying there I hear a quiet sound.¬†

‚ÄúHello.‚Äù

This didn't sound like Heather. Heather had a loud strong voice. My heart started to beat uncontrollably fast. What should I say? Do I sit up? Do I go up to her? I started to panic. I have to respond soon. I got up and stood behind the couch. I wanted to go to her. Tell her everythings gonna be okay. Once she sees her surprise I know she's going to be thankful.¬†

‚ÄúHey Heather?‚Äù That's all that I could say. What am I doing? Why did I only say that? She responded very quickly asking where we were. I didn't know what to tell her. Her new home?¬†

She started freaking out and kicking her leg, realizing she's chained. Ugh. I hate this part. Last time I made the mistake of bringing someone a little younger, she wasn't as mature. When I brought her here she had whined and cried for hours, I hope Heather isn't like that.¬†

‚ÄúIt's okay. I've got a surprise for you!‚Äù I unchain her leg and guide her to her new bedroom.¬†

‚ÄúDo you like it?

She never responded.

‚ÄúYou don't like it.‚Äù I said, trying not to show my frustration.

‚ÄúNo I don't. I'm not staying here. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck is wrong with you and why you brought me here!‚Äù she yelled¬†

I don't like being yelled at. She should know that, no one does. Father Michael says that no woman should raise their voice at a man, and that they must be punished to learn.

I push her onto the bed and tie her arms and legs to the end of the bed posts.

‚ÄúLook Heather. I don't want to do this, but people need to be punished so they can learn to never do that again.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou understand that right? I would never want to intentionally hurt you if I didn't have to. It's Father Michaels rules. You'll understand when you meet him‚Äù.

She started to yell, which just made me more angry. I cover her mouth so she can't make any noise. I started thinking about how unloyal and sneaky she was, which made me act on my anger. I go into my bathroom and grab a pair of scissors. I slowly cut into her toe nail. I started pushing closer and closer to her skin, trying to take up the whole nail. She started moving her legs. She was resisting. The only good thing I could think about when having a younger girl is that she was smaller. Easier to tame.

After only successfully ripping off three toe nails I stopped. I put the, now chipped nail polish toenails into my pocket. I'm never going to really see her feet, so I don't mind damaging them.

‚ÄúNow, do you understand why you can't be rude? People have feelings, and you hurt mine.‚Äù¬†

She nodded in agreement.

I sat in the chair in front of her bed. I just wanted to watch her. I didn't like watching her struggle, but I liked seeing how much she was going to change tomorrow. I decided I'm going to take her to michaels tomorrow. Last time I brought the other girl, Beth, but he didn't like her. I hope he likes Heather as much as I do.

‚ÄúYou better get some sleep. Tommorrows a big day.‚Äù I told her. I watched her as she fell asleep. She looks so peaceful.

I wake up from the sun shining through the corner of my window. I look at Heather. She's awake. I check my phone and it's 9:30 am. I better start getting her ready. I opened the closet and grabbed the nicely hung outfit and placed it on the bed. A flowy white dress with a pair of red flats.

‚ÄúI'm gonna untie you now , but you must behave. You know how I feel about being disrespected.‚Äù I slowly untie the knots I made at the top of the head board. Once I'm done she sits up. She hasn't looked at me since last night.¬†

‚ÄúNow I'm going to turn around while you put this on, ok? I asked

She nods yes while staring at the floor.¬†

After about 5 minutes I heard a whisper. ‚ÄúIt's on.‚Äù¬†

I said out loud the only thing that had come to my mind. ‚ÄúWoah.‚Äù¬†

I grab Heather's wrist and start heading up the stairs, turning the corner to see if my sister's car is here, it's not.¬† Heather hasn‚Äôt said anything in awhile, I hope she's not sad. I lead her into the car and wrap rope around her and the seat just to be safe. I put tape over her mouth and got into the driver's seat. The drive to see Father Micheals group is around 25 minutes. On the way we pass through the desert and closer to the mountains. Heather remained calm. As we finally arrive I pull into Michaels driveway. I get out of the car and open Heather's door. Before I could even get her untied I turned around and saw Michael standing right behind me.¬†

‚ÄúYou startled me Father Michael.‚Äù

‚Äú How have you been John, I missed you!‚Äù He says to me.

‚ÄúGood, happy to be back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell look at that, she's gorgeous!‚Äù He says well, patting me on my back.

‚ÄúThe groups all inside, eager to start.‚Äù He exclaimed.

He reaches into the car and starts stroking her hair. I'm happy he likes her. We pick her up and bring her into the back room. The back room is a big open space that Father Michael has dedicated to our group meetings. Along the walls are pictures of our family, all 63 of us. It's kind of crazy to think that this started with just 12 of us, now our families grown. We place her in the middle of the room. The other members are all here and ready to begin.

‚ÄúNow if everyone could thank John for bringing this lovely lady,‚Äù Father Michael states while clapping. He's such a good guy. He makes me feel proud of myself, I can tell he really cares about us.¬†

Everyone is looking around on the edge of their seats antsy to begin. I look at Heather and I can tell she's starting to freak out. Her hands are fidgeting behind her back trying to release herself.

‚ÄúNow as you all know we've had 10 new members join this past month. This is their first times at a ceremony, so we're going to take things slowly.‚Äù Says father Michael.

Heather starts freaking out more and manages to roll over. This interrupts Father Michael and makes him angry. He walks towards her and stomps on her hand while telling her to be quiet. He picks her up and puts her back sitting up in the seat. He grabs her face and rips the tape off, allowing her to speak. She sits there quietly with tears running down her eyes.

‚ÄúNow Heather, why don't you tell everyone why you're here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI-I-I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù She stutters.

‚ÄúCome on now, That's not true. John told me about your friend Alex.‚Äù Father Michael states while walking in a circle around her.

‚ÄúMy boyfriend?‚Äù she asks.

‚ÄúAh so you do know why you're here?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúN-n‚Äìno-o.‚Äù She says while sobbing

‚ÄúWe know what you did. John, why don't you go and explain to the group how it happened this time.‚Äù

I never got to share a story before. Most of the other members work in very different environments so they tend to have more run-ins with situations like this.

I stood up and turned to the group, ‚Äú I caught Heather being unfaithful to her boyfriend.‚Äù I could see everyone's faces mixed with anger and excitement.

‚ÄúNow do you know how hurtful that is? How would you like it if someone cheated on you?!‚Äù Michael asked while his voice got increasingly louder.

Heather remained silent.

‚ÄúYou know I was cheated on after 5 years of marriage while having 2 kids.‚Äù¬†

I love when Michael tells this story.

‚ÄúDo you think that's fair?! DO YOU?!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, But I-.‚Äù Heather started to say with tears rolling down her face before being interrupted by Father Michael.

I hate to see Heather upset, but he's right. I was cheated on three years ago, and it was awful. Women really can't just be loyal can they? Not even for family? It's honestly disgusting.

‚ÄúNow although you‚Äôve made a mistake, we're giving you another chance.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou get to be our wife.‚Äù Michael said as all of us started clapping and cheering.¬†

I'm happy this is working out. Last time when I brought Beth there had been a mix up. I'm friends with her father and had walked in on them kissing. I knew that wasn't right because he was married. When I brought her here and explained it to Father Michael he got very angry with me. He told me that this time it wasn‚Äôt the girls fault. It was too late though. I felt bad, but how was I supposed to know? He made an exception and we had trained her to be the perfect wife. She was doing great at first, but then things took a turn‚Ä¶ We let her use the bathroom alone after 3 months of earning our trust and she had slit her wrists. We were all very sad because this was our second wife we had lost. We've been sharing one wife with all of us, but now that we have new members we decided we needed someone else.¬†

I reached my hand in my pocket and started playing with her toenails from the night before. ‚ÄúHeather dont worry. This isn't your fault that you were born this way, but we‚Äôre here to help you now.‚Äù

Father Michael grabs her chair and drags her into a connected room. We all form a line and get ready to take our turns. It's finally my turn and I walk up holding a surprise behind my back.¬†

‚ÄúI brought you a stuffed animal bunny. I remembered how you liked them.‚Äù

Long time listener, first time caller - please help me find this coffee mug! I have found similar versions but not any with the ""I KNOW JACK"" wording at the top. 

My husband has loved this coffee mug for many years, after purchasing it at the Jack Daniel's distillery on a trip with his dog, Lucy, sometime between 2010 and 2015. Lucy crossed the rainbow bridge this past March after a beautiful 14 years together. We miss her every day and unfortunately, our 6 year old broke this beloved coffee mug beyond repair. 

Would also accept ""I KNOW LUCY"" because allegedly that was an option at the store at the time, but I also cannot find that.

1g5wiw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BlackSheepGoneByeBye/comments/1g5wiw5/slight_update/,Slight update ,"Yesterday was a bad day for me. I wasn't feeling well at all and Sam hovered around me like a mother hen.   
I understand why but by the end of the day I was fairly annoyed with it but tried to conceal it. Not sure if I successfully managed that but if Sam took notice he didn't say anything.   
I did cough up blood in two of my coughing fits and Sam freaked out wanting to rush me to the ER right away.   
My doctor had already warned me it would likely happen with how far progressed my cancer is. He also told me that I didn't need to come in unless it was a lot of blood or it kept happening to a point where I was losing too much blood. (I didn't, it happened twice but both times was very little blood)   
For Sam's peace of mind I did call the 24/7 nurse line my doctor offers and with the call on speaker phone we were told the same as my doctor had explained before.   
If it was only a little blood there wasn't anything they could do except admit me and monitor me if I chose to come in which I again refused.   
Sam reluctantly agreed to leave it be but told me he would take me to the ER if I continue to cough up enough blood and compared it to getting a wound or something and you needed to go to the ER for blood loss.   
I'm not sure his comparison is all that valid and honestly I am a little amused over it, but I let him be with it. 

The temperature started dropping last night and today I've found myself to be freezing. Something that is new to me as well as I usually love the cold and skiing/snowboarding but I've bundled up with warm sweats, blankets and all kinds of hot drinks to try and stay warm and I'm still freezing my ass off. Especially my fingers. I had to go dig out the hand warmers I use when we go snowboarding. 

Other than that I'm mostly okay today. My head hurts a little bit but it's nothing compared to what it has been so I'm thanking my lucky stars for that. 

  
I did take a walk in the rain the day before yesterday, it was nice and I went home and took a warm shower and drank hot tea and coffee right after to avoid the cold. I don't think it was the walk in the rain that had me feeling awful yesterday.   
I also messaged my friend group and asked if we could do dinner at my house this week.   
They are coming over Saturday and Sam and I agreed to make an extra early friendsgiving since I more than likely won't make it to Thanksgiving.   
Today Sam and I drove to a local butcher a little out of town and asked if they had any fresh turkeys which thankfully they had some they were getting ready to freeze so we got a big one. We also went and got everything else we would need including stuff to make a pumpkin pie (we couldn't find a premade) so hopefully we wont screw up the pie as neither of us have ever made one before.

Sam is working right now so he can help with the cooking tomorrow and I'm slowly doing little things I can do today, like brine the turkey, peel potatoes for the mashed potatoes, pre-boil baby potatoes for the caramelized potatoes I always make. (always a big hit)   
I'll attempt to make the pumpkin pie later today or tomorrow, we will see how I feel. If I do it today and I fail epically we could probably talk Sam's mom into making one for us, and we'd have time to go buy the stuff she will need.    
We got boxed stuffing so I don't need to do anything with that today and most of the other stuff will be made tomorrow and Saturday as well. The easy stuff like corn (from a can) and gravy (from scratch)   
Our rolls are the Rhodes frozen rolls (best rolls ever) so they just need to rise 3 hours before baking so thats pretty easy as well. 

Tomorrow we are going to Sam's parents house for dinner.   
Sam and Andy has not told their parents what's going on yet so I will be telling them tomorrow while my friends will be told Saturday. It will be two very emotional days and I'm not sure how any of them will take it. ",7,1729186482.0,u_BlackSheepGoneByeBye,0,1.0,False

1g5wfmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1g5wfmo/can_eating_too_many_acidic_foods_constantly_and/,Can eating too many acidic foods constantly and stress cause gastritis?,"Last month was a rough month for me. I was under a ton of stress and I found myself eating a lot of acidic foods and drinking a lot of coffee. I wasn't paying much attention to my diet and I think I went overboard with it. Now I've heartburn that won't go away. It's gotten better after I've been taking Pepcid twice a day for about a week now, hesitant to go beyond that. It warns don't go beyond 14 days without a doctor's advice. 

I was on Prilosec before the Pepcid, did the 14 days of it, but when I went off of it and ate, the heartburn came back after I ate something I shouldn't have (spicy queso dip).

I went to go see the doctor, but they dismissed my problem and told me to just take Pepcid but didn't give me any real instructions. They were more concerned with me getting a colonoscopy because of bouts of diverticulitis I had 2 years ago which has nothing to do with my acid reflux. No upper endoscopy, no barium test, just ""Oh, yeah, you have heartburn, whatever, we really want you to get a colonoscopy"". 

Ugh, anyway, I wanted to know if why I had this gastritis flareup is because I had too much acidic foods and stress?",1,1729186244.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False
1g5wfal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g5wfal/husband_wont_speak_or_see_my_family/,Husband Won‚Äôt Speak or See My Family,"It's been 18 months since our wedding where a lot of things went wrong. I won't go into details unless requested as it is very long but essentially my husband is hurt following my parents actions and behaviour. *Edited to include details:
‚Ä¢ My parents hadn't shown much interest in the build up to our wedding day however a few days before asked about the top table seating arrangement. They were ""mortified"" they weren't sitting next to eachother but one parent sat next to me, the other next to my husband. My father called me the following day very angry and requesting that we change the seating arrangement so they can sit together. ""Sit us at the back by the fire exit if you have to"".  Whilst on the phone, my father took the opportunity to talk badly of my husband's father as that is who my mother would have also been sat next to. My husband overheard everything. The following day my dad apologised to me and my husband in person however my husband felt his apology was not sincere.  
‚Ä¢ My father panicked, contacted my husband's mother to request her support. The same day my father in law was receiving his first cycle of chemotherapy so really there were bigger things going on in the world. Came to an agreement that my parents would sit together down one end of the table away from me. 
‚Ä¢ My parents felt they were treated poorly at the wedding by my husband's family and ended up leaving the wedding early. 
‚Ä¢ My dad missed the cake cutting and first dance to go home and let the dogs out. 
‚Ä¢ My parents requested a photo at our wedding of just me and my parents (without my husband)
‚Ä¢ During our honeymoon, my mother blocked my husband and his family on Facebook which obviously caused drama and spoilt the honeymoon. My Husband's mother sent my dad a strongly worded text essentially saying he had ruined his daughter's wedding day and was a poor father. 
‚Ä¢ There have been snide comments from both my parents and husband in the last 18 months and it just breaks me everytime.  
‚Ä¢ Neither my husband or family have spoken until my Dad sent a text to my husband asking to meet up for a coffee to try and draw a line in the sand for my sake. My husband was furious and felt things simply couldn't be shut away in a box and replied quite rudely declining the offer. My dad suggested there was no benefit in going over things again as no one will agree on what happened. 


 As you can see I have also been hurt by my family but I am willing to not hold a grudge and to move on as they are my parents. I very much have the attitude of ""you never know what could happen"". Although my relationship with my parents is not the same as it used to be, I still see them. 

Since our wedding, my husband will not speak to them. He has told me he thinks they are narcissistic and does not want that in his life. My parents would invite my husband to things, continue to buy birthday and Christmas presents however my husband will not engage with them resulting in me often making excuses for as to why he hasn't joined me at family events. My parents have now stopped making an effort with him.  

I am not asking for him to go on family holidays with them or even go over for dinner. I simply want things to be civil and for them to be able to be in the same room if that was ever needed e.g. if we had kids in a few years time. 

I guess what I am most upset about is the lack of compromise. I understand he is hurt, but I have asked him to do this for me and our relationship however he is being particularly stubborn and says he ""can't let them back in"" his life for fear of further hurt and upset. 

I am at a loss as to what to do as he tells me I am his world and would do anything for me but this isn't translating into real life issues we are facing...

We‚Äôd lived here for nearly a year. After my wife passed, Violet needed a break from the chaos of the city, and I selfishly needed to retreat into my work.

Given our remoteness, I was shocked when I glanced up and saw him, looking over the cliff‚Äôs edge.

I dropped my mug and bolted outside. ‚ÄúHey, man!‚Äù I yelled. He looked back. In that moment I saw a flicker of recognition, but the anguish was unmistakable. Then, he jumped.

I stood frozen. The stranger had shattered the morning‚Äôs usual calm. When he jumped, the world snapped back to its stillness‚Äîbut nothing felt the same.

‚ÄúDaddy? You spilled your coffee.‚Äù

Violet stood in the doorway, hair wild, wearing her horsie pajamas. I forced a smile. ‚ÄúSorry, baby. Stay in the living room while I clean it up.‚Äù

I phoned the police in the kitchen. Mid-ring, I heard Violet talking, then another voice replied. I slammed down the phone.

A man stood in the foyer, smiling at my daughter.

‚ÄúGive us a minute, sweetie.‚Äù Violet returned to her coloring and I turned to the man. ‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here about the jumper.‚Äù His smile disappeared. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs imperative we talk.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúSure. You knew him?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn a way,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúI wish I could explain everything, but time is running out‚Ä¶ Your machine works.‚Äù

I froze. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

He smiled knowingly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a peregrine falcon.‚Äù

""What?""

‚ÄúDaddy, what‚Äôs the fastest animal in the world?‚Äù Violet shouted from the living room.

I stared. ‚ÄúPeregrine falcon,‚Äù I called back.

The man nodded. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve disturbed the fabric of time. Your machine could destroy everything‚Äî I‚Äôve seen this future, but we can fix it.‚Äù

My heart pounded. ‚ÄúHow do I stop it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt stop it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe can only contain it.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I can fix it,‚Äù I said, panic rising, as I ran to the lab. I yanked the wires. The machine flashed. A piercing noise emanated. For a moment‚Äîeverything froze.

*What have I done?*

¬†‚ÄúYou knew this would happen, didn‚Äôt you? Why didn‚Äôt you stop me?‚Äù I yelled.

The man now stood in the living room. With one hand he yanked my daughter‚Äôs head back by a fistful of hair, in the other, he held a knife to her throat. Violet‚Äôs eyes were filled with terror.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù I gasped.

‚ÄúThe loop must be maintained. When the time comes, you‚Äôll know what to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy should I do what you say?‚Äù My voice cracked.

‚ÄúTo see her again,‚Äù he whispered, before opening Violet‚Äôs throat.

My world collapsed. I ran to my daughter, cradling her limp form.

In a blind rage, I bolted outside. The man was gone.

Instead, I found myself at the cliff‚Äôs edge.

A crash echoed behind me.

Becuase of my dependence on caffeine and less-than-ideal study plns, I deal with constant migraines, though, I manage, except for today‚Äî you know those migraines that pulsate through your head and feel like you're having a fucking internal bleeding? It was one of those. My classroom is particularly loud and the between class breaks aren't any better, the nurse's office was't open, and even if it was, I knew I nedded a doctor's note to request medicine. 



I couldn't learn anything, and with a test coming up, so I messaged my mother (55F) that I wanted to go back home, get some sleep and then study at the afternoon, she vehemently refused and told me to 'chug down some coffee and stay'. Of course that didn't work, I spent 4 more hours in pain, crouched up in my desk and unable to do, well, anything, when I got home, took a nap, and confronted my mother about how insensitive that was of her, she began to tell me a migraine is 'nothing' and she'd only let me skip school if I fainted on my desk or something of the sort, said it was my responsability and she wouldn't raise a 'whiny, childish girl who can't stand some pain'and how she endured all that and ended up 'just fine'. 



I yelled at her, told her it was like she cared more about school than me. (It wasn't the first time I had to endure discofort or pain during school.) And how all she did was make it worse, she told me if I'm in such pain I should cut out talking to my friends or doing my hobbies for  a few days, and, in impulse, I said I despised her attitude towards me, she walked out on me, and now, if I were to try and sleep more to recover, I wouldn't be able to do my assignment for tonight + all the chores I have to do.



I feel really bad, guilty and childish, maybe she was right, and I'm being whiny, but now I'm on the verge of tears because I have an assignment due tonight and can't get a sentence through without my head feeling like it'll explode. Reddit, AITA?

**Mystery Product #1**

1. The botanical in question is in the ginger family, and contains similar bioactives, such as 6-shogaol. 

2. This botanical has a rich history of use in many different cultures, and its use even goes beyond humans. Lowland gorillas consume this botanical as a part of their natural diet, which seems to produce unique effects on their cardiovascular function. 

**Mystery Product #2**

1. This compound is created and released during exercise, and appears to be involved in a lot of the health benefits of exercise. 

2. The main use for this compound when supplemented, is to increase the conversion of white adipose tissue to brown adipose tissue. 

  
**Kanna Powder**

* Over the last year, many of you have become big fans of our quick dissolve kanna tablets. However, it‚Äôs quite a potent product and many people have expressed interest in a powder version so that they can tailor a perfect dose for themselves. This powder version uses the exact same kanna extract that is found in our tablets, the Full Spectrum Kanna 5% alkaloids, 3% mesembrine (FSK53) extract. This extract is also highly water soluble, making it a convenient option for making a beverage with the FSK53!

**Mushroom Magic Coffee Baller Edition & Coffee Latte Powder**

* A few months ago we came out with our first ‚ÄòBaller Edition‚Äô of Mushroom Magic Matcha which uses a much more premium mushroom blend and very high quality Japanese matcha. We really love the effects profile of the ‚ÄòBaller Edition‚Äô so we decided to also give the ‚ÄòBaller‚Äô treatment to our Mushroom Magic Coffee. This version has double the caffeine of the Mushroom Magic Matcha Baller Edition, making it a highly energizing mushroom beverage. Mushroom Magic Coffee Baller Edition has become a quick favorite in our beta-testing group amongst those who like a little stronger stimulation! 
* Mushroom Magic Coffee Baller Latte features the same great ingredients as our Mushroom Magic Coffee Baller but with the added convenience of coconut powder, creating a premade latte formula. This makes it easy to enjoy a creamy, delicious mushroom coffee latte with just water‚Äîno need for any added milk! It‚Äôs a simple way to elevate your coffee experience while still getting all the benefits of our baller blend.

Back in March, I had COVID and was hospitalized for two days. During that time, my heart rate stayed between 120-140 bpm, which was pretty scary. Fast forward to the summer, I got an Apple Watch and started noticing random episodes of tachycardia while at rest, with my heart rate going up to around 110 bpm (¬±5) for 10-20 minutes. These episodes happen anywhere from 3 to 18 times a day and are completely random.

I‚Äôve had some tests done ‚Äì EKG, echocardiogram ‚Äì both came back normal. I wore a Holter monitor, which picked up some things: premature atrial contractions, first-degree heart block, and atrial tachycardia.

Interestingly, right after the Holter test, I caught COVID again, but that time it was much milder.

I saw a cardiologist who basically brushed everything off and blamed caffeine and my ADHD meds. But here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôve been drinking coffee my whole life without issues (just 1-2 cups a day), and I wasn‚Äôt even on my ADHD meds during the summer when the palpitations started. Plus, whether I‚Äôm on or off the meds, it doesn‚Äôt seem to change how often the episodes happen.

The cardiologist offered me metoprolol as a ""quick fix,"" saying the palpitations likely aren‚Äôt harmful, but I‚Äôm hesitant to start a lifelong medication, especially since the palpitations aren‚Äôt super bothersome to me at this point. I‚Äôm more interested in finding out the root cause than just masking the symptoms.

I‚Äôve got another appointment with a different cardiologist for a second opinion, but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar. Any advice on how you handled it, or questions I should ask at my next appointment?

For additional context, I don‚Äôt experience any noticeable symptoms during these episodes, such as shortness of breath or dizziness. In fact, about 70% of the time, I don‚Äôt even realize the palpitations are happening ‚Äî it‚Äôs only my Apple Watch that alerts me to them. One of my concerns with starting metoprolol is the possibility of rebound effects, especially related to hypertension if I ever stop taking it. My cardiologist reassured me that rebound effects occur only if you‚Äôre using beta blockers for hypertension, but not for palpitations. I‚Äôm not entirely convinced, since beta blockers act on the same mechanisms in both situations, but I‚Äôm not a doctor, so I‚Äôm uncertain. Thoughts?

# What are the pros and cons of AI built websites?

We though it would be great idea to do some testing before we write a article about The Pros and Cons of Using an AI Website Builder although e already had our thoughts reserved .

# [A Real-World Comparison: AI Website Builder vs. Professional Developer](https://www.newperspectivestudio.co.za/The-Pros-and-Cons-of-Using-an-AI-Website-Builder-to-Build-Your-Website/)

To offer a fair comparison of the pros and cons of AI website builders and back up our points, we conducted a test by using an AI website builder to create a layout for¬†**Ledgerwood Financial Services**. Below is the prompt we used:

‚ÄúCreate a website for Ledgerwood Financial Services with a sophisticated corporate design, featuring navy blue and bronze colors. The homepage should open with a full-width image of businessmen, overlaid with the text ‚ÄúExpert Financial Solutions for Over 80 Years‚Äù and a ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù button. Include an ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù section that introduces Ledgerwood‚Äôs 80 years of expertise in providing personalized financial planning, investment management, tax advisory, retirement planning, and wealth creation strategies. The ‚ÄúServices‚Äù section should display images for each of these five core services with short descriptions underneath. At the bottom, include a client logo slider showcasing key partnerships, followed by a call to action encouraging users to ‚ÄúContact Us Today.‚Äù The website should exude a professional, high-end feel, consistent with Ledgerwood‚Äôs reputation.‚Äù

The result of our Prompt:

And here is the design by one of our developers.

https://preview.redd.it/zjeoictxlcvd1.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=285cf243cb3bf75afd0b4eea7ec2dec3f1b1f46a



# 1.¬†Layout and Structure

* **Developer Design :**¬†The layout is well-structured, with clear visual hierarchy and balance. The placement of content feels intuitive and user-friendly. The use of white space allows each section to breathe, making it easier for users to scan and understand the information. The¬†**full-width banner**¬†and the¬†**about section**¬†flow naturally into the service offerings, followed by a client logo slider and a strong call to action.
* **AI Design (Second Image):**¬†While the layout is clean, it lacks the same thoughtful structure. The spacing between elements, particularly the services and partner logos, feels uneven. There‚Äôs an overuse of white space, which creates a sense of disconnection between sections, making the page feel fragmented.

# Visual Appeal and Branding

* **Developer Design:**¬†The¬†[branding](https://www.newperspectivestudio.co.za/Marketing-Logo-and-brand-design-company-east-london.html)¬†is consistent and professional, with a cohesive color scheme of navy blue and bronze that aligns well with the corporate tone of¬†**Ledgerwood Financial Services**. The colors are used strategically to highlight important calls to action (CTAs) like ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù and ‚ÄúLearn More,‚Äù drawing attention without being overwhelming. The imagery, including professional business images, reinforces the brand‚Äôs credibility.
* **AI Design:**¬†The color scheme is less vibrant, and the overall design lacks the same attention to branding details. While it uses navy blue, the contrast between colors is not as refined. Additionally, the¬†**hero image**¬†is much less engaging, and there‚Äôs a mismatch between the overall tone of the site and the images selected. The banner image of the coffee cup, for example, feels somewhat out of place for a financial services company, reducing the professional impact.

# Typography

* **Developer Design:**¬†Typography is clear and professional, with proper font hierarchy and line spacing that enhances readability. The font sizes vary appropriately for headlines, subheadings, and body text, guiding users‚Äô attention to important areas of the website, such as the services section and CTA buttons.
* **AI Design:**¬†The fonts in the[¬†AI web design](https://www.newperspectivestudio.co.za/ai-website-design-and-development/)¬†are basic and lack the refinement found in the developer‚Äôs design. The headings and body text don‚Äôt contrast as effectively, making it harder for users to differentiate between sections. There‚Äôs also less visual emphasis on key information, such as service descriptions or CTAs.

# User Experience and Navigation

* **Developer Design:**¬†The user experience is well-thought-out, with clear navigation and sections that follow a logical flow. The inclusion of elements like the¬†**client logo slider**¬†and¬†**‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù CTA**¬†at the bottom adds trust and helps drive conversions. Users can easily understand what Ledgerwood offers and are encouraged to take action throughout the page.
* **AI Design:**¬†The navigation in the AI design is functional but lacks the same level of user engagement. For instance, while the¬†**CTA**¬†buttons exist, they don‚Äôt stand out as much as in the developer‚Äôs version. The¬†**partner logos**¬†are also grayed out, which diminishes the trust-building effect they‚Äôre supposed to create.

# Imagery and Media

* **Developer Design:**¬†The use of high-quality, professional images aligns with the financial services theme. The images used in the ‚ÄúOur Services‚Äù section effectively represent each service offered, giving users a visual context for the business.
* **AI Design:**¬†The hero image and service-related images are much less representative of the business. The lack of relevant imagery diminishes the professionalism and clarity of the services Ledgerwood provides.

# Call to Action

* **Developer Design:**¬†The CTAs in the developer design are prominent, clear, and well-placed. The ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù button in the hero section immediately engages the user, while the ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù button at the bottom provides a secondary opportunity for conversion. The buttons stand out due to their color contrast and strategic placement.
* **AI Design:**¬†The CTAs are present but feel less compelling. The ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù button blends too much into the background, and there‚Äôs less visual emphasis on the action you want users to take. This could lead to lower conversion rates.

This real-world test showcases one of the major¬†**cons of using AI for website design**: while AI can generate a website quickly, it often lacks the deep understanding of¬†**branding**,¬†**user experience**, and¬†**conversion optimization**¬†that a human designer brings.

With the recent influx of AI tools many are turning to¬†**AI website builders**¬†for fast and cost-effective solutions to creating an online presence. But is it the right choice for you? In this article, we explore the¬†**pros and cons of using an AI website builder to**¬†[**build your website**](https://www.newperspectivestudio.co.za/web-design-in-east-london.html)¬†and address key questions, such as ‚ÄúShould I use AI to build a website?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat are the benefits of AI in web design?‚Äù

# Should I Use AI to Build a Website?

Using an¬†**AI website builder**¬†can be an excellent solution for certain needs, but it‚Äôs important to weigh the¬†**pros and cons**¬†before deciding. AI tools offer speed, convenience, and cost savings, but they also come with limitations in¬†**design, customization, and SEO**.

# What Are the Pros and Cons of AI?

# Pros of Using an AI Website Builder

# Cost Efficiency

AI website builders are initially much more affordable than hiring a full development team. This makes them an appealing choice for startups, small businesses, and individuals with limited budgets. However, while the upfront costs are lower, it‚Äôs important to consider potential hidden costs (discussed later in the cons section) related to redesigning or refining the website after the AI‚Äôs limitations become apparent.

# Speed and Convenience

AI tools are known for their speed, allowing you to generate a functional website in a matter of minutes. This is particularly helpful when time is of the essence, such as for a product launch or a rebranding campaign. However, while¬†**AI is fast at creating something**, it‚Äôs often¬†**unplanned**, which may require costly revisions or redesigns down the road.

# Automation and Maintenance

AI-powered platforms often offer built-in automation features, such as automatic updates and performance suggestions. These tools help reduce the manual effort needed to¬†[maintain and optimize your website](https://www.newperspectivestudio.co.za/What-is-Website-Maintenance-and-Why-is-it-Necessary/), particularly for routine tasks like applying security patches or adjusting content based on user behavior.

# Scalability

Many AI website builders offer easy scalability. You can add new pages, blog posts, or products as your business grows, often with just a few clicks. This makes AI a suitable option for businesses that anticipate needing to expand their online presence over time.

# Cons of Using an AI Website Builder

# Lack of Human Design Intuition

AI-generated websites often lack the creative and strategic touch that a¬†**UX designer**¬†would bring. While AI can put together a website quickly, it often results in a rigid, template-based layout that lacks¬†**flexibility**¬†and doesn‚Äôt offer the kind of¬†**brand differentiation**¬†you may want.¬†**Human designers**¬†can intuitively create a user experience that is more engaging and tailored to your audience‚Äôs needs, which AI tools often struggle to achieve.

# Customization Limitations

AI builders are generally effective at creating simple websites but lack the ability to implement¬†**complex customizations**. For example, if you need to integrate a¬†**MySQL database**¬†or add custom back-end features, AI tools won‚Äôt be enough. You‚Äôll still need to hire a¬†**developer**¬†to handle these more sophisticated tasks, which can increase costs significantly.

# SEO Issues

AI-generated content often pulls from¬†**aggregated information**, resulting in¬†**non-unique content**¬†that may be too similar to other websites using the same tool. Search engines prioritize¬†**original content**, and using AI for content creation can harm your SEO rankings. Google is unlikely to index pages that don‚Äôt offer something unique or valuable, which can negatively affect your website‚Äôs visibility.

# Misleading Claims About No Technical Skills

AI website builders often claim that¬†**no technical skills**¬†are required, but that‚Äôs only true for basic websites. In reality, human expertise is still necessary for¬†**prompt engineering**,¬†**coding**, and¬†**marketing**¬†strategies to maximize the potential of these tools. While the interface may be user-friendly, creating a truly effective website still requires knowledge of¬†**SEO**,¬†**conversion optimization**, and¬†**custom development**¬†to get the best results.

# Copyright Concerns

Another potential drawback is the issue of¬†**copyright**. AI-generated content may not be eligible for copyright protection, leaving businesses vulnerable to legal risks. This can be particularly problematic for companies that rely on unique content to stand out in the market. You may need to invest additional time and resources to rewrite AI-generated content or design elements to ensure originality.

# Hidden Costs and Redesign Challenges

While AI tools can create a basic website quickly and cheaply, the¬†**lack of planning**¬†in the design process can lead to costly revisions later. The site may not convert as well as you hoped, and you might find that¬†**hiring a designer or developer**¬†to fix issues with layout, functionality, or SEO ends up costing more in the long run than simply working with a professional from the start. In short, AI is great for generating something quickly, but it often requires more¬†**time and money**¬†down the line to refine the results.

The use of¬†**AI in web design**¬†offers several benefits:

* **Quick Setup**: AI can generate websites rapidly, allowing you to focus on growing your business rather than spending months in development.
* **Cost Savings**: AI tools are generally more affordable than traditional web design services.
* **Built-in SEO Suggestions**: Some AI website builders offer built-in SEO tools that can help optimize your website, although they aren‚Äôt always as effective as human-driven SEO strategies.

# Is It Safe to Use AI Websites?

In most cases,¬†**AI websites**¬†are safe to use, but there are some considerations to keep in mind.¬†**Security patches**¬†are often automatically applied, and reputable AI website builders are typically compliant with industry standards. However, as with any website, it‚Äôs crucial to ensure your site is secure by implementing HTTPS, secure payment gateways, and up-to-date software.

# Using an AI Website Builder to Build Your Website

While¬†**AI website builders**¬†offer¬†[website cost](https://www.newperspectivestudio.co.za/wp/what-is-the-cost-of-creating-a-website-in-south-africa/)¬†savings and speed, they cannot replace the human touch required for high-quality design, customization, and marketing strategy.

For context, I am a 34/F, 5'7 and currently at 155lbs. Back in 2021 I was feeling sick, stressed and had bad headaches and around 161 lbs. Turns out that my lab numbers were all high, like my a1c -5.8 at the time. I decided to get a trainer and do better and cleaned up my diet a bit.. 6 months later my a1c went up 5.9!!! What the hell! My weight barely changed.

My doctor knew I was working hard and understands that my family history of high blood pressure, diabetes and cancer makes it harder to get the a1c under control (and to drop weight).  She suggested metformin and I immediately asked if I could get a little more time to make more changes.

It wasn't until I got into dancing (and I guess lost a tiny bit of weight like 5lbs) that my a1c went down to 5.3 in 2023 of August. Now in October 2024, I'm still dancing and lifting and active but I ran into some super stressful stuff like moving, cutting off bad relationships and needing to go to therapy and now my a1c is up to 5.7. I know my diet is not perfect but I'm definitely not demolishing cookies, drinking dunkin donut xl coffees and eating trash everyday.I did everything I could to not be on medication and now I'm considering metformin but I feel down about it and am tired of being stressed about this.
 
I feel like I'm a failure or my efforts to have a balanced lifestyle isnt enough and prediabetes is always around the corner.. I suffer from food noise but try so hard to not give in. Sometimes I look at people around me and I find life sometimes so unfair on how they can just cut out soda (I can't drink soda due to its nasty fizziness) and drop 10lbs in a couple of days. Some of my friends are way less active than me and have way more weight on them and yet no pre-diabetes? No high blood pressure? Man, fuck all this. 

Anyway thank you for reading, I'm just so fed up and although 5.7 is borderline, I am tired of all this back and forth and just want to be normal and not at risk anymore. I also am just so tired of caloric counting and tracking every damn thing. I know there's nothing wrong with medication, especially metformin but I just didn't want to be on something I might have to take the rest of my life. But I'm finding myself tired of this battle and just want to give in. ",2,1729184687.0,prediabetes,0,1.0,False

For heroin users it's preparing their shot, tying off, etc. People actually come to love these behaviors because the reward system in the brain pumps them full of meaning because they inevitably lead to the drug high. For a whisky user, it's paying large sums of money for their drug, admiring the nice bottle, swirling their scotch around in their snifter. Lmao, that's all it is. If donkey piss was your only source of alcohol, you'd be swirling donkey piss around in a glass pretending there was such a thing as good donkey piss. You're not refined; you're just a drug user.

The association between the peripheral elements of consumption and the addictive substance is still there. Addictive substances hack the reward system. They trick the brain into thinking something good or beneficial happened, so then your brain makes everything associated with that outcome seem more pleasurable, like the taste of burning plants.

A real cigar aficionado should appreciate the qualities of a wide variety of burning plant materials, not just tobacco. What about smoking dried radish greens, you don't appreciate that with your refined taste?

EDIT My BP does not allow for anti depressants. For every reason, they seem to drive mania, nearly immediately. I struggle with depression every day. I pay attention to every bit of food I eat and every bit of drink I drink. I'd like to add. I tried CBD orally and cannot take it with consistency. As it makes my mood inconsistent, I cannot take caffeine consistently which is a shame. I love coffee but 3 times a week. It's okay. Tea only and i find making ginger and turmeric, "" tea"" myself with no caffeine best for me. Chai or matcha when I can caffeine.

Edit 2 for whatever reason I can't make effective lists on reddit, cut me some slack I have bipolar and CPTSD with 20 concussions and 4x confirmed tbi.

Hello darlings! üíñ I just posted another installment of my Ineffable Prompt A Thon AU inspired by @ineffablyruined, following Mistaken Identity, Unraveled, Whisper, and Overheated!

Week 10‚Äôs prompt is Golden ‚ú® Aziraphale has some unpleasant realizations regarding his feelings for his free use slut, but he can keep them in check, he knows‚Äî so long as Crowley doesn‚Äôt feel the same way, this is doable.

Or so he tells himself.

This is an *angsty* one, my friends! Be sure to check all tags and notes before reading ‚ú® Hope you enjoy! 

Tags: Human AU, Coffee Shop AU, Dom Aziraphale, Sub Crowley, Jealous Aziraphale, Aziraphale has a Past, Traumatized Aziraphale, Feelings Realization, Feelings Denial, Angst, Bandstand Scene, Confrontation/verbal fight, break up, emotional hurt, and more. 

*Excerpt*:

When they‚Äôd begun the *casual-by-a professional-dominant‚Äôs-standards* free use contract which they‚Äôd literally started to refer to as The Arrangement after Crowley had phrased it as such (ah, the whimsy of an invented proper noun; Aziraphale is *hopelessly* fond of whimsy), he‚Äôd not been much concerned when it came to the emotional risks of the thing.

The two of them saw eye to eye on nearly‚Ä¶well, nearly *everything*, their limits matching almost suspiciously just like their interests and desires, and that even included a mutual dispassion towards the idea of *‚Äòmore‚Äô*. There was no reason whatsoever to suspect that might change on one or both of their ends, nothing except for a pesky little thing known as The Human Condition, something of which Aziraphale has a rather gifted talent of compartmentalizing to the point of disappearance at times.

But the golden, liquid amber resplendence that is Crowley has permeated every single setting and bezel of Aziraphale‚Äôs mind, and it did so with *remarkable* swiftness‚Äî within a week, it was all Aziraphale could do not to cancel all of his sessions for the foreseeable future so he‚Äôd could instead stay inside Crowley for days on end, reveling in that velvety warmth and inhaling his cedar clove sweat and listening to his beautiful begging and crying that tumbled from his lips the second Aziraphale started to touch him.
Aziraphale has been *slipping*, and that unequivocally is *not an option*, except that apparently, it is.

What‚Äôs been locked away has burst free from its confines with a nearly *ravenous* vengeance, and what Aziraphale has tirelessly and skillfully dismantled‚Äî the *want*, the ache for that harrowing concept of *‚Äòmore‚Äô*‚Äî it‚Äôs been reignited, and the blaze is close to out of control, unchecked by his feeble efforts to staunch it. The precise, shining planes of his life aren‚Äôt just cracking, they‚Äôre *melting* from that fire, they‚Äôre being replaced by the luminous angles of freckled pearl skin and Aziraphale is, in a word, *panicking*.¬†

1g5vki1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1g5vki1/i_found_a_peeping_tom_in_my_apartment_building/,I Found A Peeping Tom In My Apartment Building,"I remember the day I moved into the apartment. I was excited. I thought a fresh start in this big building, with its clean, sterile hallways and well-manicured lawns, would finally bring me peace. Maybe I‚Äôd meet new people‚Äîfinally make some friends. The space was quiet. It was comforting.

But I never did make friends. I kept to myself, spent most of my time at my desk, struggling to make ends meet with freelance gigs that barely paid enough for rent. The walls felt so thick at first, like I was insulated from everything outside. A cocoon. But now‚Ä¶ now it feels like the walls are alive.

At first, everything was fine. I relished the quiet, the solitude. I‚Äôd sit in my cramped little room, the desk shoved against the single window overlooking the alley, and write. The sounds of the city filtered in through the thin walls‚Äîthe hum of traffic, the distant blare of sirens, the occasional argument spilling out from the neighboring apartments. But in here, I felt safe.

***That‚Äôs when I found the hole.***

I discovered it by accident one night while rearranging the furniture. The fridge was old and heavy, and when I tried to push it against the wall, it scraped across the floor with a hideous screech. That‚Äôs when I saw it‚Äîa small, dark space, hidden behind where the fridge used to sit. It was odd. Just big enough for a person to squeeze through. A perfectly carved passage, almost too perfect. Like it had been waiting for me.

At first, I ignored it. I pushed the fridge back into place and told myself it didn‚Äôt matter. It was just an old building‚Äîquirky, filled with forgotten nooks and crannies. But that hole‚Ä¶ it lingered in my mind. Days passed, and I kept thinking about it. Every time I sat down to work, it was there, gnawing at the back of my brain. What was inside? Where did it lead?

*Curiosity got the better of me.*

One night, I pulled the fridge back, and there it was‚Äîdark, beckoning. I crawled inside, feeling the cool, stale air wrap around me as I squeezed my way through. It wasn‚Äôt long before the narrow passage opened into a hidden hallway.

The walls were damp, the smell of mildew thick in the air. Trash littered the floor‚Äîdiscarded clothes, candy wrappers, and God knows what else. I should have turned back right then. But something about that hallway‚Ä¶ it drew me in. *Like it was meant for me.*

The first time I crawled through the hole, I noticed how narrow the passageway was. The air inside was thick, humid, and I could barely breathe as I shimmied forward on my hands and knees. The walls brushed against my skin, wet and clammy, like some kind of... living organism. The space around me pulsed, like it was alive. My skin crawled, but I couldn‚Äôt stop. I kept moving, though, drawn forward by a strange compulsion, until I found myself staring into a peephole.

It was a young couple. They were laughing, sitting close together on the couch. So happy. So unaware of the world outside. I watched them for a long time, my breath shallow. They didn‚Äôt see me. They couldn‚Äôt see me. But something about the way they were... it reminded me of something I‚Äôd lost. I didn‚Äôt realize how much time had passed until the man looked directly at the wall where the peephole was. My heart stopped. I swear for a moment he saw me. His eyes locked onto mine, even though there was no way he could.

I scrambled back, my hands shaking. But I couldn‚Äôt stop. I moved forward, toward the next apartment.

Each apartment was worse than the last. In one room, a group of friends were playing video games, music blaring through the speakers. Their laughter echoed through the walls, loud and mocking. They were oblivious to everything around them, even as I pressed my face closer, hungry to be part of their world. But I wasn‚Äôt. I was nothing more than a shadow. A ghost in their space.

The next room... I wish I hadn‚Äôt looked. There was an old woman. She was hunched over, knitting something in the dim light, her bony fingers trembling as they worked the yarn. She looked just like my grandmother. But when she turned her head to the side, I saw her face‚Äîsunken eyes, skin hanging loose like she was already dead. I stepped back, gasping for air, but it was like the walls had grown tighter around me.

*Then came the room with the violent sound.*

I heard it before I saw it. The dull thud of something heavy hitting flesh. The sickening sound of bones breaking. My stomach churned as I looked through the peephole.

A man stood over a woman‚Äôs lifeless body, his chest heaving, his face twisted in rage. Blood stained the floor, the walls. The woman‚Äôs eyes stared blankly at the ceiling. I wanted to scream, to call the police, to do anything. But I couldn‚Äôt move. I was frozen, my hand trembling against the wall.

The man towered over her lifeless body, breathing heavily, and then‚Äîthen he looked up. *Right at the wall. Right at me* and *His lips curled into a smile.*

I stumbled back, my heart racing. What the hell was this place? Who had made this passage? Was I the only one who knew about it? My mind was a blur of questions, but before I could turn and run, I saw another door. This one was different. There was a light shining underneath it, spilling into the dark hallway. It beckoned me, just like the hole had.

I approached, my breath shallow, and pressed my eye to the peephole.

It was a room unlike any of the others. The walls were lined with mirrors, lights framing each one like a backstage dressing room. There were costumes scattered across the floor‚Äîfeather boas, sequined dresses, hats of all shapes and sizes. And in the center of the room was a single chair, facing a mirror.

Something inside me‚Ä¶ shifted. I opened the door and stepped inside. The air was different here. Warmer, somehow. Inviting.

There was a large, ornate mirror with lights around the edges, like something you‚Äôd see in a dressing room. There were clothes scattered everywhere‚Äîold costumes, hats, masks. It looked like a movie set. My breathing slowed. This place‚Äîit felt familiar.

I stepped inside, drawn to the mirror. My reflection stared back at me, but there was something wrong with it. My face looked... twisted. The longer I stared, the more my reflection began to move on its own. It smiled when I didn‚Äôt. It tilted its head, eyes narrowing like it knew.

I bolted back into my apartment, heart pounding against my ribcage. I practically jumped through the hole. The memory of that horrific smile haunted me‚Äî*the man who killed his wife.* I needed to escape, to block it all out. But how could I? The hole behind the fridge loomed in my mind like a sinister invitation.

I needed a moment to breathe, to gather my thoughts. What should I have done? Should I call the police? I walked to the kitchen, my hands shaking as I drank a glass of water. I stared out the window at the dimly lit parking lot below. Something felt off. *Maybe, I was just hallucinating‚Ä¶.*

As nightfall covered the skies, *I decided to sleep away the uncertain reality,* to wash away the horrors of the day. But as darkness wrapped around me, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I was not alone. The walls whispered secrets I couldn‚Äôt decipher, and shadows danced just beyond my field of vision.

Then came the sound‚Äîa soft rustling, like fabric brushing against skin. My heart raced as I sat up, squinting into the darkness. There, in the corner of my room, was a figure. Dark and menacing, it hovered just out of reach. I felt paralyzed, unable to scream or move.

When I finally mustered the courage to turn on the light, the figure morphed, contorting into the shapes of my room. The shadow stretched, expanding until it seemed to breathe. It lunged toward me, but before it could reach me, it vanished‚Äî*like smoke in the wind.*

I woke up the next morning, *it was all a dream‚Ä¶...?* The sunlight filtering through my blinds like a warning. I stumbled into the kitchen; the haunting memory of the dark figure still fresh in my mind. I needed caffeine, something to ground me. As the coffee brewed, I tried to shake off the creeping unease. That‚Äôs when my eyes met with the fridge or maybe behind it, *the hole was still there‚Ä¶the uncertain reality was real.* The hole became bigger than ever.

Maybe, there was a peeping tom in the building. I decided to talk to the landlord. I stepped outside, ready to confront him about the uncertainty in my apartment, but the hallway was empty. No one stirred, no voices echoed back. *It was dead silent‚Ä¶.* I knocked on a few doors, but nobody answered. It felt strange, but maybe most of the tenants were sleeping.

Just as I was about to head back inside, I spotted a man dressed entirely in black, carrying a heavy bag. His movements were erratic, as if he was in a hurry.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I called, trying to sound casual. ‚ÄúExcuse me, can you‚Äî‚Äù

But he ignored me and slipped into the elevator. As the doors began to close, I caught a glimpse of something red peeking from the bag. My heart raced as realization struck‚Äîa glimmer of *blood.* It was the man I‚Äôd seen earlier‚Äîthe one who‚Äôd killed his wife.

I stumbled back, horror gripping me like a vice. I bolted up the stairs, my legs feeling like jelly. I burst through my door, gasping for breath, and darted toward the fridge wall. I had to know.

I ripped the fridge away, my hands trembling. There it was, the hole‚Äîthe same gaping maw I had discovered before. Was it really there? Was any of this real? Panic surged through me. I fumbled for my phone to call the police, but the signal was dead. No bars.

A soft whisper slithered through the hole, chilling me to the bone. ‚Äú*Come in,*‚Äù it beckoned, *low and seductive*. I felt drawn to it, as if it were a siren‚Äôs call, promising solace.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I muttered to myself, backing away. I tried to block the hole with my hands, but every time I turned, it was still there, larger than before, beckoning me with its darkness. I could hear voices now, faint and melodious, urging me to return.

‚ÄúCome back,‚Äù they whispered, ‚Äú*we can make you whole again.*‚Äù

I crawled through the hole, the familiar sensation of panic washed over me as I entered the narrow corridor. The atmosphere felt different‚Äîthicker, more suffocating, as if the walls were closing in.

As I moved forward, the same scenes unfolded around me‚Äîcouples laughing, friends playing games‚Äîbut the warmth and laughter felt tainted. My skin prickled, the hair on my arms standing on end. I continued deeper into the darkness, knowing I had to confront whatever lay ahead.

*And that‚Äôs when I found him‚Ä¶.*

The same room as before, each item stood in its place perfectly still‚Ä¶. only a new member had moved into the building‚Ä¶. A body laid dead in the corner of the room, its skin pale, its fingernails elongated and dirty, as if he was the filth of the building. I touched him‚Ä¶. his body decomposed right before me‚Ä¶. black liquid oozed of its body‚Ä¶. like he had been dead for many a millennium‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

*I had found him‚Ä¶. I had found the peeping tom‚Ä¶.*

With each passing moment, I felt a change within me. My body began to feel strange‚Äîmy skin became pale and clammy, like I was living in a world without sunlight. My fingers elongated, stretching unnaturally as if reaching for something just out of grasp. I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, and my reflection was grotesque, twisted beyond recognition.

I touched my face, feeling the cool, clammy surface of my skin, the features melting and reforming in the warped glass. I could feel the walls of my apartment morphing around me, the texture becoming fleshy, almost breathing, as veins pulsed underneath the surface. Panic surged through me.

‚Äú*What is happening?*‚Äù

I gasped, scratching at the walls, desperate to escape this nightmare. My nails dug into the surface, but instead of breaking through, they sunk in like flesh, giving way beneath my fingertips. *But suddenly‚Ä¶*

I woke up in my bed again‚Ä¶. only this time‚Ä¶*it was all a dream???* No‚Ä¶It can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶I walked into the kitchen to brew myself coffee‚Ä¶ My eyes shifted themselves towards the hole‚Ä¶It had grown bigger‚Ä¶ The scent of coffee brewing filled the air, but it did little to soothe the rising anxiety clawing at my insides. My gaze shifted toward the fridge wall, where the hole waited like an insatiable maw.

*It had grown bigger.* The memory of the dark figure, the chaos, and the grotesque reflection of myself danced through my mind. I shivered, a chill creeping up my spine. I felt a magnetic pull toward it, an undeniable urge to go inside and *rewitness* the events, to make sense of the madness swirling in my head.

*Tonight, I would return.*

As night fell, I sat in my dimly lit apartment, anxiety mingling with anticipation. The coffee had long gone cold, and the shadows seemed to stretch longer, closing in around me. I took a deep breath, steeling myself for the journey ahead.

The moment I crawled through the hole, I felt the familiar sensation wash over me‚Äîa cold embrace that wrapped around my body like a shroud. The corridor yawned before me, beckoning me deeper into its twisted embrace. Each step echoed through the emptiness, and I could feel the anticipation thrumming in my veins.

The scenes returned‚Äîlaughter, love, sorrow, violence. They unfolded before me like memories, each moment drawing me closer to the dark truth lurking just beyond my reach. As I traversed the corridor, I caught glimpses of life happening all around me, the pulse of the building thrumming beneath my feet.

But today, I stumbled upon a room filled with clothes and costumes, the remnants of lives lived outside of mine. My gaze fell on a bowler hat resting on a chair. I reached for it, slipping it onto my head. As I stared into the mirror, I felt a strange shift‚Äîa weight lifting, a lightness in my chest. I wasn‚Äôt me anymore. I started to dance, laughing at my reflection as I spun in circles. The hat slipped down over my eyes, and for a moment, I forgot everything. Forgot the blood, the death, the darkness. It was just me and the mirror. *I felt less lonely‚Ä¶.*

But when I lifted the hat, my reflection wasn‚Äôt dancing. It was standing still, grinning at me with wide, unblinking eyes. And behind it‚Äîbehind me‚ÄîI saw something move. I began to move, swaying to some invisible rhythm, dancing in front of the mirror like a man possessed. It felt good. Freeing. Like I was shedding my old self, becoming someone new, someone more alive. The people in the building‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt know me. They didn‚Äôt see me. But I saw them. I was with them. Their lives, their secrets‚Äîthey were mine now.

I was the one who watched. I was the one who knew.

*Now I was the peeping Tom*

Now I wasn‚Äôt just some lonely writer anymore, barely scraping by in a tiny apartment. I had become more than that. I was the one who moved through the walls, the one who saw everything, the one who danced in the dark while they lived their ordinary, oblivious lives. *The hole had made me whole*

All along, it had been me. The one watching, the one lurking. Those people in their apartments‚Äîthey weren‚Äôt strangers anymore. They were my friends. My family. And the man who had killed that woman‚Ä¶ he was part of it too. He didn‚Äôt know I had seen him, but that didn‚Äôt matter. I had his secret now, and that made him mine.

I laughed and it felt good to laugh again. When was the last time I had laughed like that?

I stood up, adjusting the hat on my head, and walked back down the hallway. The doors, the rooms, the people‚Äîthey were all part of my world now. My hidden empire. And as I made my way back to the hole, back to my little apartment, I felt‚Ä¶ complete.

*Madness had consumed me and reality had become me*

The hole had been waiting for me. This place had been waiting for me. And now that I was here, I could see everything clearly.

As I sit here, typing away a story I wish no one can read‚Ä¶. just know‚Ä¶. *I am the Peeping Tom.*

And maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe‚Ä¶¬†*I‚Äôm watching you right now.*

As you read these words, as your eyes move over the blue screen as you sit there in your quiet little life, maybe I‚Äôm there. Just behind you. Just out of sight. Watching. Waiting. You aren‚Äôt alone, I am with you‚Ä¶*for you are my friend‚Ä¶*

If you wish to meet me, maybe crawl into a hole just like I did‚Ä¶. you might even find me there or *maybe become the next me*‚Ä¶.",4,1729184067.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

His pediatrician recommended we go to the ER. He had 1st and 2nd degree burns & thankfully it wasn‚Äôt very severe and will eventually heal with no permanent scars.

When we went to the ER and we have to wait for 4 hours for the ‚Äúburn doctor‚Äù to evaluate him. During this time no one touched him and they gave him Tylenol. The burn doctor came in said he will be fine and left and his assistant put Bacitracin and a bandage over it and sent us home. Keep in mind Bacitracin and bandages cost 5 dollars at CVS. 

Let me first tell you I have what in America is considered good insurance. I pay 215 every paycheck and have a deductible of $500 per person. However $150 for copay for an ER visit. 

The hospital billed us $2,000 for that visit. With my copay and deductible I have over $600 dollars for that visit. It makes me so sick. It makes me contemplate even going for help because I feel like I am going to be ripped off. It doesn‚Äôt add up to me. How is this allowed for the hospital to charge this much?!

1g5vj4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Foodfight/comments/1g5vj4r/foodfight_restocked_the_whole_package_warning/,Foodfight Restocked: The Whole Package (WARNING: SPOILERS),"Foodfight will star the famed Dex Dogtective and his pal Daredevil Dan with the basic concept of sunshine goes missing and brand x tries to take over and it's an all out foodfight

Stage 0: Tutorial

Dan's your man and in a little tutorial room, he will show you the basic moves, including the uppercut, dash, ground pound, mach run and mach turn. Then show you how to attack enemies with a giant prune (this giant prune cannot hurt you). Whether it'd be a jump on their head, swiping at them with your claws, the uppercut, or the mach run/mach turn. As you progress through the tutorial you'll collect 5 plane parts \[the body, the wheel, the propeller, the wing, and the tail\] Dan will tell you that if you collect all 5 parts you can play his minigame for lives and continues. However, since this is the tutorial, he'll just let you play the minigame straight off

Stage 0.5 Flight School

Essentially a practice run of the Daredevil Dan minigame, it will teach you how to fly the plane, and also to avoid enemies and collect chocolate bits, for every 100 chocolate pieces, you will get an extra life. You can only be hit 3 times before the plane will crash. Get a mega chocolate piece and you will blast through enemies for a short time in a chocolatey sugar rush. Make it to the finish line at the end and you will receive an extra continue. However, since this is a practice run, it will just be a short flyby and then 30 seconds to try it out for yourself

Stage 1: Mr. Rat Face

(An opening cutscene will show the carlson's market closing for the night and the store becoming a city. here we'll see some familiar faces, the chinese food section will become chinatown with wontom as it's mascot \[a reference to the chinese tom meme\] The italian food section being turned into venice with chef boyardee as the head honcho. Then the vlassic story will drop a mother's baby but it turns out to be a pickle \[a reference to the stork scene often used in cartoons\] it will then show dex on top of the balloon with the fat cat burglar \[who's name will be changed to, Mr. Rat Face because he's a rat after\]

Dex: Listen up Mr. Rat Face, I'm giving you one last chance to hand over the kittens before I snap the trap on ya.

Mr. Rat Face: Ha, when I'm through with you, the only dogs people will like will be hot dogs.

Dex: If I had a raisin for everytime I've heard that one.)

The first boss battle will be pretty easy. First you'll have to attack the hairless hamsters which like the plums won't attack you, but will hurt you if you touch them without doing any of the attacks Dan taught you in the tutorial. They only take one hit to be defeated though. Mr. Rat Face is slow and will try to charge into you. Just jump over him and hit him when he's stunned. After 2 hits of the slam move, he will try to ground pound you, get out of the way and hit him when he's stunned. For the final hit point, he will ground pound and then jump  to either his left or his right depending on where you're at, and then land and charge at you. Hit him and stun him

(cut to next cutscene:

Dex: Alright Rat Face, Looks like I'm gonna have to do things the hard way.

Dex takes out olive spear and pops the balloon. Mr. Rat Face falls first and then dex and then the kittens. Now he's got to save the kittens)

  
Stage 1.5 Kitten Quest

Dex will be free falling and must catch the basket of kittens in 10 seconds. You cannot fail in this level but if you catch the kittens you'll be rewarded with the Daredevil Dan minigame

  
Stage 2: To the Club

(a cutscene will show more of the story with sunshine goodness \[who will be more of an anthro like Dex so there's no bestiality undertones\] going missing, and dex giving up the sleuth business to run the copabanana. Meanwhile, Mr. Clipboard offers to bring Brand X Into the store. Leonard at first is skeptical as he got hurt last time he used Brand X. We then cut to a Brand X consumer offering Leonard some brand X coffee by the fire. Leonard accepts the coffee but then gets torched with a branding iron \[Ironically shaped like an X\]. After this Mr Clipboard promises that Brand X will grant the store with higher profits for upgrades and such. And so Leonard agrees. We cut to an X on one of the boxes for brand x and then it fades to the x on the word dex on dex's door, dex still saddened he lost the love of his life is cheered up by his friend Dan as it's a big night at the copabanana. With a brand new mascot moving in.) 

The level will mostly be like platforming, with speed as a good focus given the mach run, also got to find the plane parts of course. About halfway through the level, you'll see Cheasel. T. Weasel \[who will have a bit of a color change with less crap colored browns like with the actual movie\] At the end of the level you will see cheasel hit by a train, but not before he says his line, ""You despise me don't you""

Stage 3: Banana Split

(a cutscene will have Dan entering the copabanana and telling Dex that the new mascot has a sweet tooth for chocolate before he gets hit with the door and we see Lady X \[who will be an anthro rabbit with a more curvaeous figure unlike the slim jim we got. And yes, she's an anthro to avoid the bestiality undertone.\] Everyone is head over heels for her and it eventually turns into an all out fight for her. Dan has to make it to the stage where the California Raisins are to get everyone's attention to stop the brawl.)

Another platforming level ensues

(at the end of the level another cutscene will play. People flee the copabanana but as it turns out, some of the mascots are expired)

Stage 4: Xquisete

(Dex senses something familiar about Lady X but he can't put his finger on it, so he decides to head to the  Brand X Detergent Building to get some answers from Lady X)

Another platforming level starting off in the streets and then ending up in the Detergent Building. Where at the end of the level Dex frees Dan

Stage 5: 2012: A Daytime Oddyssey

(A cutscene will show Dex obtaining the elixir used in Brand X Products and makes his way to Dr Pepper. It turns out the elixir is laced with the essence of discontinued mascots, which is what makes customers squander over em. Meanwhile, Lady X is forming an Exobite Army, one of the kidnapped mascots screams that the mosquitos have returned before PeaBrain Paul \[Lietennant X's name cause he looks like a bunch of peas\], slaps and tells him to shut up. Brand X is too strong, however, the west side of the store has not been consumed yet and so Dex and Dan need to get to the other side of the store, but it's daytime and a specific chemical in the air of the real world is toxic to the ike's, and thus, they'd be killed instantly if they try to enter the real world. But, Dr Pepper has created a special helmet that would let them breathe in the real world.)

A hot foot it across store shelves, but unlike most stages where you can regain all health by collecting big raisins, here, if you get hit 5 times, the helmet will break and you'll lose a life, big raisins here will just grant additional raisins which act like the chocolate in Dan's minigame.

a boss battle will take part against General X \[Mr. Mash\]. His attacks consist of throwing globs of dirt at you which will hurt you but if they miss, they'll become potato monsters that will charge at you with a pitchfork. his second move will happen after a 2nd miss from him \[essentially a hit\], and will have him shoot a blast of milk at you that you have to duck. Final attack will be a gauntlet of these with 2 throws and then 1 blast repeated 3 times. He'll be stunned and then deliver the final blow, knocking his face off since he's a glob of mashed potatoes. 

Stage 6: Foodfight! (There, I Said It)

(It turns out Brand X had Sunshine recalled, with the main honcho being someone by the name of Priscilla \[AKA: Lady X\]. It's time for a foodfight and Dex and Dan gather all the mascots that aren't taken by Brand X into this battle and an all out foodfight ensues. Meanwhile, Dex has to make it to the Detergent building again to stop Lady X Once and for all)

Platforming, what else did you expect.

Upon entering the detergent building again, Sunshine is found and Lady X Instructs Lieutenant X to kill Dex. Leading to a boss battle. the first move will be him throwing his hat like a boomerang. His second move will be a buttery charge as he slides on a slab of butter. Unlike Mr. Rat Face, This PeaBrain is much faster and can even jump at a random point to throw you off. The 3rd move will happen after the next hit point and will have him shooting a bunch of peas into the sky, they become big and you have to dodge them, then one of the peas hit's the Lieutenant and stuns him, so you can land another hit. Then his last move is an all out gauntlet.

Stage 7: Special Delivery

(No minigame afterwards for obvious reasons)

(Sunshine and Dex are together again and the Brand X army has been destroyed with many of the brand x soldiers now killed off. Dan also flies in through the hole made during the boss battle, But it's not over yet as Mr. Clipboard is heard, overhearing that somebody ordered a recall. Dex tells Sunshine to go with Dan, as he's got a bone to pick with Mr. Clipboard. Dex stands face to face with Mr. Clipboard.)

Mr. Clipboard: It must be you they wanted recalled.

Dex: if you want to recall me, you have to catch me first!

1st Phase: A Chase begins with you having to dash through enemies and avoid hazards as well as the incoming feet of Mr. Clipboard, reaching the end of this phase will be signified by a long string. 

(a cutscene will follow with Mr. Clipboard falling and the legs decapitated from his body \[don't worry it's a human robot\]. Dex believes it's over, but it's only just begun with the menace taking a snap at Dex but narrowly missing. they're now on a rooftop as phase 2 begins)

2nd Phase: Reminiscent of Donkey Kong (1994), You have to avoid Mr. Clipboard's hand attacks. Each hand takes 3 hits to destroy and will be one of 3 moves, 1st one being a default slam, 2nd one being a crushing move, and 3rd one being a multiple slam across the platform with one hand. After breaking he hands, ground pound into his head and the torso will be detached and destroyed.

(another cutscene will play out the clipboard falling below. Dex believes it's now over, but suddenly the building crumbles beneath him and Mr. Clipboard's head bursts out of the building, sending Dex and some products flying, he grabs a soda and pops it open, using it like a rocket for the 3rd and final phase)

3rd Phase: Clipboard will try to attack you with a gauntlet of random moves, which consist of Charging straight at you, spitting out brand X products and a few exobites trying to smash into you. After a while, Dan will fly in and spawn a cola pop rocks bomb touch it to make it fall on Clipboard and make it explode. Do this 2 more times and Mr. Clipboard will begin to explode as he slowly falls off screen.

(another cutscene plays where Mr. Clipboard falls to the ground and explodes into a million pieces. And out pops Lady X, dazed and dizzy. the rest remains unchanged until the part where Lady X mentions that she still has the elixir and that she'll be back. When Dex hears this, he grabs her, and throws her around like a toy, then punches her in the face several times, before finally landing an uppercut sending her flying away never to be seen again and also allows him to get the elixir. Marketopolis is saved.

So Yeah, that's the basic concept of this video game.

1g5vhyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1g5vhyt/f26_is_this_the_end_of_my_9_year_relationship/,(F26) Is this the end of my 9 year relationship with boyfriend (M25)?,"I met my boyfriend 9 years ago online when I was 17 and he was 16. We long distance dated this way for a year until I chose to move over to his country at 18 for multiple reasons, not just him. I have been living with him since. 

Everything has been fine up until lately. I feel like there has been a glass break in my mind and I can‚Äôt shift the idea that I may be with him more for convenience and the comfort I have grown to feel with him. He was my first and only boyfriend and I can‚Äôt help but feel I am missing out on all different kinds of experiences by being with him.

We spend all of our free time together when neither of us is working. But this time we spend together about 90% of the time consists of us sitting silently together while he plays video games and I read or scroll through my phone. Sometimes we watch movies or shows together. We rarely go out of the house and we recently got a new puppy which just makes the whole sitting inside all the time thing ten times worse.

As I mentioned, I moved to this country for him so I have no other friends or family here apart from his friends and family. I feel isolated in a way because outside of him, I know nobody here. It feels like our relationship has become stale as we just sort of co-exist in the same house or room a lot of the time. We don‚Äôt have sex very often as it is usually me that doesn‚Äôt feel like I want to. 

He isn‚Äôt the type to plan any kind of date or day out either so we sit at home together majority of the time when we are off work and it feels boring that we don‚Äôt do anything fun or outside of the norm. 

He also doesn‚Äôt clean up after himself and I am sick and tired of mommy-ing him. He is autistic so I have given him plenty of time and leeway to learn but he throws clothes everywhere, gets me to make most of his meals, leaves plates and cups anywhere he wants and never just generally tidies up any room he‚Äôs in. I‚Äôm not crazy about cleaning either but I do like to come in from work to not see plates and cups piled up and clothes that he has took off strewn around everywhere. He also has this tendency to take things like books out of the bookshelf and then just leave them laying around or other random items he has just abandoned that never go back into their normal place. He also hates it when I tidy up because then he has no clue where that random item he left on the coffee table has gone and causes a small argument over it being moved. I also drive him to and from work every single time as he doesn‚Äôt drive so for me it‚Äôs just starting to feel like I am there to essentially run his life for him while he gets to sit back and allow me to do all the heavy lifting. When I‚Äôm home, I‚Äôm the one cooking, cleaning, washing dishes, taking the dog out early in the morning if he needs the toilet, driving us both too and from work‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm exhausted. I order his repeat medication and sort it out for him to take daily too. Anything that I don‚Äôt do (washing his clothes, ironing his work uniform etc) his mum does as we live with her. His dad died a couple years ago and he had a depressive spiral for years after and has only started to pick up in the last two years but I feel that his mother and I shouldn‚Äôt be doing everything for him because of this.

I can‚Äôt wait most of the time for him to go to work so I can sit and relax on my own and I feel a relationship shouldn‚Äôt be this way. We both work part time and I study towards a degree at the same time. He says he will eventually start studying to get his degree too but I feel we just have hugely different ideas of when we want the ‚Äúfuture‚Äù to begin.

My concern in splitting up would be I have absolutely nobody I can turn to in this country but my job is here and I wouldn‚Äôt like to go back to my home country. I also have a puppy and two cats with him and it breaks my heart the idea of having to leave them behind. 

Though, saying that, the idea of us breaking up does make me sad. I have spent nearly a decade with this man and the thought of not knowing him anymore hurts. ",2,1729183892.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

This is important as many people including myself bought Mueller Home product thinking they were supporting Aterian.

","My(20f) bf(23m) and I have been together for 10 months. Yesterday morning I went to use the bathroom while he was in the shower getting ready for work (this is normal for us). The door was locked, which he never does so I knew he had done the nasty. I knocked on the door and immediately knew what had happened. Now we briefly talked before he left for work, he said he was very guilty and ashamed for masterbaiting and locked the door because he didn‚Äôt want to get caught or hurt my feelings. I asked if he was watching porn and he said he had inspo. After his shower he went to the kitchen and made coffee. I texted him and said I didn‚Äôt want to judge him for his natural desires but was a bit hurt he didn‚Äôt turn to me to help him out. I said I assumed we were okay in this area of our relationship and maybe we need to talk? I even added a joke about how he had no problem waking me up for sex during our Valentine‚Äôs Day weekend. After the text I thought all was good. 

I came down to help him pack up for work and kiss him goodbye, while I was in his arms I felt a wash of anger and I pushed him off in that moment and said that he was watching other women. Yes I did feel a bit jealous he was looking at other women and maybe I wasn‚Äôt good enough. He came home from work and we made dinner etc. we ended up having sex that night and right before bed I had asked him why he watched porn instead of just waking me up. He said he didn‚Äôt want to wake me and that he was embarrassed. That‚Äôs when he said he didn‚Äôt watch porn‚Ä¶I was confused because what else would he do then? That‚Äôs when he told me he was looking at photos of other women on Reddit. I‚Äôm a bit new to Reddit so I didn‚Äôt think that was possible. He went on his Safari and showed me his saved and I scrolled to see tons of photos of naked women with huge boobs and butts. In the moment I just turned off his phone and flip over going to bed. I felt so crushed because none of those women look like me. I don‚Äôt have large boobs and I have an average butt. I feel like I‚Äôm at a loss emotionally. Yes we talked it through and he won‚Äôt masterbate in the bathroom anymore. Am I overthinking this? I just feel crushed he had to turn to random women online instead of his girlfriend‚Ä¶ what should I do? This morning we had sex but I just couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it and couldn‚Äôt get myself there, we both just stopped and he got ready for work. 

Also to add he didn‚Äôt message or communicate directly with any of the women, he just looked at the pictures. I didn‚Äôt click on them so I don‚Äôt know if he commented or not.

We began texting almost daily and there will be times I got annoyed with his reply times as I would be left on delivered for 1-2 days,he would complain and say his busy he can't give me all his attention especially at this 'stage'.

Moreover,the one time I didn't text him for 3 days (I did not leave him on delivered like he did),he made an issue out of it and said that when he does it I shouldnt complain.Even though its not at all the same.If his on the chat he will send one thing and am left on delivered for like hours l,I genuinely don‚Äôt understand how it takes you hours between each text to reply,there always some excuse though.Recently its a group project at uni that his making him really busy.

Furthermore his really poor at conversation on the phone, if he starts a conversation it‚Äôs a stupid meme or snap or one word and he can never keep a conversation going.

I could overlook the poor texting skills if we continued to see each other in person but apart from snaps i have never gotten to see him apart from that initial meetup,he always finds an excuse when i try to get him to go on casual linkups like coffee,drinks whatever.He explained when he met me he had a lot if of free time and that nowadays he has work,social life and uni,if you‚Äôve been reading along you know why thats a copout answer.

What confuses me he hasn‚Äôt asked to end it he‚Äôs given me the option twice but he himself hasn‚Äôt ended it.

1g5vgdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1g5vgdk/dismissal_from_employment_question/,Dismissal from employment question.,"My daughter and I live in the Asheville area and were affected by Helene.  She is 18 and works at a local grocery store chain, in a coffee kiosk.  Her income is an essential part of our households ability to keep our living situation.  

We both had GI issues, as our septic system was damaged and we were trapped in our home for several days.  It wasn‚Äôt the most sanitary situation, sadly. 

There were no cell or Wi-Fi signals at our place.  Any calls or messages we just didn‚Äôt receive.   

Once the store reopened, an employee with an AWD car showed up and told her she was scheduled for a shift.  He was angry she wasn‚Äôt ready.  We just had not received the call.   She told him she couldn‚Äôt work, anyway, because she was vomiting.  

No one needs to be serving $8 coffees in a disaster situation with no clean water, while vomiting, as well. 

She received a text from her boss telling her that they knew she wasn‚Äôt ill, that they were removing her from the schedule, and wishing her luck finding another job.   The kid called me crying and absolutely melting over being fired. 

I texted the supervisor to confirm that she was indeed sick, as was I, and to ask if she was actually firing her.

Supe responded that if we brought in a doctor‚Äôs note that day she still had a job.  The issue with that was that there were no doctors‚Äô offices, urgent cares or anything of the sort open.  The hospital or the Red Cross tent were options, but this was not an emergency and no one should be either of those places, interfering with the tragic injuries being treated. 

Basically, supe gave her an impossible requirement.   Supe also saw the error of her ways and backpedaled about a week later, asking daughter to reconsider, come in and discuss the situation.  We know that my daughter was the only trainer, the only person certified to close the kiosk at night, and carried a lot of the responsibilities.  Essentially, supe realized she cut her nose off despite her face AND shot herself in the foot.  My daughter did not go in to speak to them, as she does not wish to work there any longer (this is not the first time this exact situation has happened, with her returning to the job).  Supe is explosive and abusive and she takes her anger out on a bunch of high school kids. 

We did go to the doctor, as soon as we could and she was treated appropriately for her illness.  We do have proof that she was indeed ill. 

I know North Carolina is an at will state. Is there anything about the way they‚Äôve handled this that I should speak to an attorney about?  
My goal would be to bring the bosses abuse to light primarily, but also to make sure that there isn‚Äôt something that I‚Äôm missing that my daughter may be entitled to, other than unemployment.

She also claims they both had plenty of sex. Like what in Gods name? While I'm not saying there isn't a possibility (I guess), I still have a hard time believing Dylan would have gone on with the massacre if he did have sex.

Now Eric?? Hmmm, maybe a little more believable.

 Do you all think this was some fan girl account hoping to ruffle some feather or could be legit? Again, Eric, hmmm, maybe..but Dylan, I could not think he would pound a random chick and not tell Zach, Brooks, or Devon. Especially without a condom? Come on now. 

I am eager to see comments because I about spit my coffee out at the thought of someone possibly making this up (8 years ago). I mean, hey, we don't know. Maybe this is real, but what are the odds. If it is true, i hope that child is well cared for. I'm not one to bring up weird past stuff, but this one did it! I wasn't on reddit 8 years ago, so some things are new!

I will remind you of my work hours,"A few years ago now I worked as a nurse in Wales. There was a junior sister there who was an odd woman. She would openly bully a couple of staff members by telling them to do a faster hand over by entering the room several times during said hand over to tell them to be quicker, until she was told that they would be a lot quicker if they hadn‚Äôt been made to stop several times during their report. 

I didn‚Äôt drive at the time so had to take the bus, one early shift the bus was a bit late which made me 5 minutes late to the start of the shift. I was told by junior sister that I would need to take the 5 minutes off my 20 minute coffee break or work an additional 5 minutes at the end of my shift. When I started to voice my annoyance at being punished for something out of my control, I was told ‚Äòyour working hours are from 7-30 am to 3-00pm with one 20 minute break‚Äô. I chose to deduct the 5 minutes from my already short break as leaving 5 minutes late would leave me late for my bus home. 

A few shifts later I was getting on with my work and had a few care plans to rewrite, at the time all notes were hand written, as I had been a bit frosty with junior sister, just keeping any conversations strictly professional I sat down to start rewriting said care plans.  Junior sister asked if I wanted a hand to which I replied if you would like to, thank you, to which she picked a bunch up and went into her office. Cue malicious compliance, bang on 3 pm I packed up my things grabbed my coat and made a point of saying goodbye to junior sister, she looked up from her desk and asked me where I was going to which I responded home, she said she was still writing my care plans and would I write a couple so she can get them done quicker, yes, you guessed it, I replied with, ‚Äò my working hours are from half seven till three, I get no leeway when my bus is late so I will no longer be staying after my shift has finished, I will just hand over any outstanding jobs to the next shift‚Äô to which I walked off, I would like to say the look on her face was priceless, but I had already left the ward and didn‚Äôt see it, so worth loosing 5 minutes to not be able to finish my food on my break.

I write in 3rd person, past tense can easily put out a few paragraphs! I don't have a length requirement, as long as there's effort put in and the story gets moved forward. 

OC‚Äôs only & I prefer more realistic faceclaims / descriptions, but I'm not too picky. I prefer at least 2 'main characters' per person, with a reoccurring side character or two that can get more 'screen time' if we like them! I like plotting as we go to keep the story interesting! If you really only want to play one MC that's not a deal breaker, as long as you're still helping to carry the story! 

I am a queer nonbinary guy myself, and I lean towards masculine/nonbinary characters & queer pairings, but I genuinely care most about the chemistry between the characters! I also love exploring polyamorus dynamics, but I do not like any characters cheating. 

I'm also 33, so I'd prefer partners be 25+, but 21+ is a requirement! 

I do like including nsfw elements in the roleplay eventually - if the characters have chemistry & we have been writing together long enough to be comfortable with that. I do not want it to be instant or the focus of the rp! 

Now onto the fun stuff!! 

**Modern settings / plot ideas**:  main craving right now is centered around a horse ranch - I could also be convinced to do a post-apocalyptic setting on a ranch, but this would need a lot of collaborative plotting! We can also add some of the following elements or keep them separate:

Small town with the classic troupe of childhood friends / sweethearts where one moved away and one stayed. Can include the one who moved getting famous and falling from fame or moving back for PR reasons. 

Single parents / exs / coparents

Something centered around a coffee shop - could be paired with a local or new to town musician who starts performing there or just a new hire or regular. 

**Medieval fantasy plots**- my go to for this is usually some kind of arranged marriage - it's an overused troupe, but it's a good excuse to get the characters together and there's always tons of drama built in! My default fantasy system is d&d as a base but we can collaborate on lore! 

I currently have a specific idea with for an age gap between an older knight & a princess engaged to someone else. It's a classic rescue  story a the beginning and we can discuss plot points moving forward!

I also write over Discord - I'll send that out after we chat a little! Feel free to send me a message or chat request if you're interested! Let me know what plots / ideas you liked and please add your own!! Collaborating and plotting together are really important to keeping the story going!  ",1,1729183115.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

ETD around December 15th, so the itinerary could get modified by weather. I will have all the recommended cold weather emergency supplies in case we get truly stranded. But those considerations aside, my tentative plan is for a 6 day trip, staying in dog-friendly motels each night, which hopefully gets progressively easier towards the latter half:

1. Seattle to Missoula

2. Missoula to Gillette

3. Gillette to Sioux City

4. Sioux City to Chicago Suburbs (Tinley Park?)

5. Chicago Suburbs to Pittsburgh

6. Pittsburg to central Jersey

If all goes well weather-wise, that \*should\* keep all driving days at less than 8 hours each, and most of the stops will have solid places to grab dinner in the evening and coffee in the morning. But my questions for ya'll: 

- Any suggested alterations? An alternative I considered is trying to make it to Bozeman on Day 1, and then going --> Rapid City --> Des Moines --> Toledo --> Jersey in order to skip a Wyoming stop (I hear the weather can get Biblical out there). But the longer drive felt like a stretch at that time of year. I could also try to make it from Missoula --> Spearfish or something on Day 2 of the original itinerary, and then keep everything else the same. But that whole section of the country will be new to me so I don't have a good sense of what is feasible.

- Recommended Chicago suburb to stop in? I'm trying to avoid the worst of the city traffic, while also staying somewhere somewhat lively where I can go for a walk and get some food. 

- Anyone know some good dog parks at/near any of those stops? My dogs are gonna be bored af but nothing makes them happier than some off-leash time.

- Recommended app for weather alerts and pass closures? I know WA and MT have state-specific mountain pass alerts which I'll keep an eye on. But if there's a comprehensive app that collects all those and combines with other weather info along a route I'd happily pay for it. 

- Anything else I'm not considering?

We first noticed each other last year and we would see each other frequently during breaks. Every time we walked past one other, we used to stare at each other in a non-awkward flirty way. I really wanted to go talk to her but I lacked the courage. Time went by and I found myself one year older and still in the same situation, only this year the staring kept getting more and more intense. I decided I had nothing to lose and followed her on Instagram. She very quickly followed me back. But I had no plan after that. A week goes by, and after a day of high-school during which we saw each other multiple times I decided to shoot my shot and DM her on Instagram. I told her I noticed her in high-school and thought that she was cute and asked her if she would like to have a coffee after high-school. She responded and said ""I'm sorry, but I'm already texting someone"".
I felt heartbroken, knowing that if I texted her sooner, I was probably going to go out with her. This happened almost a week after first following her on Instagram. What should I do? I am fully aware that it's my fault for not making a move sooner, but I had no idea that she would eventually start talking to someone else in a matter of days. Do I still have a chance with her? How can I move on? I feel like I've lost a gem and I feel horrible.

Hello! Fellow Perfume Lovers,

So my husband was in Florida for a work trip and got back to India 3 days ago. I had a laundry list of perfumes I wanted, but at the last minute he got to know that his baggage allowance was limited to one unit at sub 55 pounds. Full bottles were clearly out of the question which bummed me out so! 

But then he visited T J Maxx once and video called me to show me these precious discovery sets from Miim.Miic. It was an astounding ""Yes! Please and Thank you"" response from me, because A) I hadn't tried nor heard of this brand of perfumes before (unavailable in India as far as I know), B) These discovery sets were lightweight enough for him to bring back without exceeding the baggage allowance, and C) I could try 8 different variants - BONUS!

So here's my opinion on each fragrance. My apologies for the awkward photos - hubby took them in haste at the store, then trashed the cardboard boxes and stuffed the vials in thick socks to protect them while packing for his return journey. Don't worry, the socks were laundered so the perfumes were fine (Phew! üòÖ LOL!!).

1) No. 31 Woody Cocoa Vanilla: Inspired by Billy Eilish Eilish. This smells like sweet vanilla, mild berries and cocoa butter. Ranking: 8/8.

2) No. 32 Warm Gourmand: Inspired by Sol de Janeiro Cheirosa 62. A warm sensual sweet and slightly powdery scent. Ranking: 5/8.

3) No. 49 Gourmand Floral: Inspired by Killian Love Don't be Shy. Sweet pillowy floral amber. Ranking: 3/8.

4) No. 52 Sweet Strawberry Milk: Inspired by Melanie Martinez Crybaby. Sweet cinnamon vanilla (could hardly detect any strawberry notes). Ranking: 7/8.

5) No. 57 Pistachio Tonka Woods: Inspired by Kayali Pistachio Yum Gelato. Creamy airy raw pistachio vanilla. Most comparable to the inspiration and to Paris Corner Khair Pistachio (also a dupe which I have). Ranking: 1/8.

6) No. 76 Spicy Amber Vanilla: Inspired by YSL Black Opium. Coffee citrus vanilla sweet. Also quite comparable to the inspiration. Ranking: 2/8.

7) No. 79 Cherry Vanilla Wood: Inspired by Tom Ford's Lost Cherry. Mild cherry rose musky slightly powdery. Ranking: 6/8.

8) No. 99 Amber Floral Wood: Inspired by MFK BR540. Dense floral saffron. Very similar to the inspiration and to Lattafa Ana Abiyedh Rouge (yet another dupe which I have). Ranking: 4/8.

Overall thoughts: 

Pros:
1) They have truly nailed it with ""mimicking"" the OG perfumes (I'm sorry but I just had to plug that in somewhere in this write-up, haha!). Even though I haven't tried many of the inspirations, the reviews online suggest high similarities.

2) A nice set to try for Gourmand newbies and lovers alike.

3) Will make for cute gifts.

4) Lasts longer on fabric. 

 Cons:
1) While I absolutely love each and every one of their fragrances, I feel Miim.Miic has bleak lasting power on skin. 

2) The vial packaging could be improved. 4 out of 8 of them had leaked slightly by the time they completed their long journey from the US to India, so I reckon they may not be practical to travel with. 

 Any hacks to make them last longer? I tried going ham with the application and that helped a bit but not enough to have a huge impact on the longevity, sillage and projection. 

 I would love to know from others who've tried this brand - What has your experience been? And are there more discovery sets aside from these two? Also, which other variants would you recommend? 

Thanks for reading. Cheers, and keep smelling amazing!

Absolutely love it aside from one major complaint... The glass carafe is a joke! I dont know how many times a week I end up spilling coffee just trying to pour from the thing.

1g5uzna,https://www.reddit.com/r/Necromanifesting/comments/1g5uzna/baking_bread_for_the_dead/,Baking Bread For The Dead,"It goes without saying you must be spiritually protected and mentally prepared to do this. You should also note that a lack of results or becoming anxious before they come (Which sabotages your manifestation) is the first sign of spiritual protection not being sufficient to accomplish your manifestation.



You need coffee, flour, salt and sugar for this. You can use other sweeteners but I recommend natural ones since modern chemical sweeteners can be unpredictable in rituals. This spell makes a ceremonial ghost bread so I have not considered nutrition and the sugar and caffeine content is sky high. It will also probably come out super hard and pale because I have no idea how to bake.



First, put flour into a bowl. You can add water but ghosts need caffeine to interact with the world so it‚Äôs recommended to use as much coffee as possible and as strongly brewed as possible. The next step is to add salt to purify the ghosts of any negative energy, so add a lot of salt into the mixture. Then add lots of sugar, honey, or maple syrup to sweeten the ghosts. Mix it with a spoon until it gets thick enough to bake, and then put it in the oven, preferably on top of an aluminum foil sheet.



Wait 30 minutes or so until it gets hard, then put it outside or on a shrine and then light incense next to it and call upon the spirits of the dead to come and eat. Joss incense works best but any works. You can also use the ghost bread for your own ancestors.

1g5uzd5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g5uzd5,"I tried 8 Miim.Miic Roll-on perfumes, and I'm in Gourmand heaven!","
Hello! Fellow Perfume Lovers,

So my husband was in Florida for a work trip and got back to India 3 days ago. I had a laundry list of perfumes I wanted, but at the last minute he got to know that his baggage allowance was limited to one unit at sub 55 pounds. Full bottles were clearly out of the question which bummed me out so! 

But then he visited T J Maxx once and video called me to show me these precious discovery sets from Miim.Miic. It was an astounding ""Yes! Please and Thank you"" response from me, because A) I hadn't tried nor heard of this brand of perfumes before (unavailable in India as far as I know), B) These discovery sets were lightweight enough for him to bring back without exceeding the baggage allowance, and C) I could try 8 different variants - BONUS!

So here's my opinion on each fragrance. My apologies for the awkward photos - hubby took them in haste at the store, then trashed the cardboard boxes and stuffed the vials in thick socks to protect them while packing for his return journey. Don't worry, the socks were laundered so the perfumes were fine (Phew! üòÖ LOL!!).

1) No. 31 Woody Cocoa Vanilla: Inspired by Billy Eilish Eilish. This smells like sweet vanilla, mild berries and cocoa butter. Ranking: 8/8.

2) No. 32 Warm Gourmand: Inspired by Sol de Janeiro Cheirosa 62. A warm sensual sweet and slightly powdery scent. Ranking: 5/8.

3) No. 49 Gourmand Floral: Inspired by Killian Love Don't be Shy. Sweet pillowy floral amber. Ranking: 3/8.

4) No. 52 Sweet Strawberry Milk: Inspired by Melanie Martinez Crybaby. Sweet cinnamon vanilla (could hardly detect any strawberry notes). Ranking: 7/8.

5) No. 57 Pistachio Tonka Woods: Inspired by Kayali Pistachio Yum Gelato. Creamy airy raw pistachio vanilla. Most comparable to the inspiration and to Paris Corner Khair Pistachio (also a dupe which I have). Ranking: 1/8.

6) No. 76 Spicy Amber Vanilla: Inspired by YSL Black Opium. Coffee citrus vanilla sweet. Also quite comparable to the inspiration. Ranking: 2/8.

7) No. 79 Cherry Vanilla Wood: Inspired by Tom Ford's Lost Cherry. Mild cherry rose musky slightly powdery. Ranking: 6/8.

8) No. 99 Amber Floral Wood: Inspired by MFK BR540. Dense floral saffron. Very similar to the inspiration and to Lattafa Ana Abiyedh Rouge (yet another dupe which I have). Ranking: 4/8.

Overall thoughts: 

Pros:
1) They have truly nailed it with ""mimicking"" the OG perfumes (I'm sorry but I just had to plug that in somewhere in this write-up, haha!). Even though I haven't tried many of the inspirations, the reviews online suggest high similarities.

2) A nice set to try for Gourmand newbies and lovers alike.

3) Will make for cute gifts.

4) Lasts longer on fabric. 

 Cons:
1) While I absolutely love each and every one of their fragrances, I feel Miim.Miic has bleak lasting power on skin. 

2) The vial packaging could be improved. 4 out of 8 of them had leaked slightly by the time they completed their long journey from the US to India, so I reckon they may not be practical to travel with. 

 Any hacks to make them last longer? I tried going ham with the application and that helped a bit but not enough to have a huge impact on the longevity, sillage and projection. 

 I would love to know from others who've tried this brand - What has your experience been? And are there more discovery sets aside from these two? Also, which other variants would you recommend? 

Thanks for reading. Cheers, and keep smelling amazing!

I know caffeine is an identified trigger for a lot of folks, myself included (makes me so amped, paranoid, panic attacks, etc.), I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has a huge sugar sensitivity?

Most people say that energy from sugar is a myth and it actually causes you to crash but for me sugar is a recipe for being super amped, jittery, anxious, paranoid in similar ways to caffeine though not as severe. I can still eat sugar unlike caffeine but in waves (assuming during episodes) sugar is a mess for me. I actually had a period of time recently where I couldn‚Äôt eat sugar without having a panic attack or jittery messy breakdown.

I‚Äôve finally cut out caffeine officially because it‚Äôs too much of a risk and I can only tolerate it when purely depressive (I tend to not get a ton of pure depressive episodes) and I tend to gravitate toward it more when manic anyway which is DISASTROUS.

I feel like I‚Äôm close to highly regulating my sugar intake as well because it‚Äôs just a mess now. This year has had a lot of UP and psychotic symptoms, I got on antipsychotics a few months ago, and I‚Äôm more aware of my triggers now (I guess technically not even close to the worst psychotic symptoms but my disorganized thoughts are turning more and more into voices). Sugar has been such a high trigger for me the past handful of months.

In some ways maybe this is good, diabetes runs in my family and sugar feels so off-putting now that it‚Äôs basically becoming the equivalent of coffee for me.

I enjoy alone time, and avoid interaction most of the time because its boring and causes me to feel anxious, the only emotion I feel during social interaction is anticipation and relief when it finally ends, it‚Äôs never happiness, so it makes sense I avoid it. After being inconsistent with my antidepressants, my social anxiety symptoms returned full swing. I work as a Barista at a coffee shop and a personal shopper at Walmart, these were jobs I was able to get because of my antidepressants, without them I would still be unemployed. Now I can‚Äôt quit, and it‚Äôs torture going in to work everyday. I just feel patronized and disrespected a lot of the time. I‚Äôve been working as a barista for half a year and I‚Äôve gotten everything down, but my coworkers assume I‚Äôm incompetent and slow because I don‚Äôt talk a lot. They always unload their tasks onto me because they know I wouldn‚Äôt say no. They constantly micromanage me and I cry in the bathroom a lot. I guess I tie my self worth to my achievements and a lot of the time, I like to feel like an overachiever and like to prove to others that I‚Äôm capable and competent, I hate feeling useless. People take advantage of this in my workplace. I hate how my hard work gets taken for granted, I hate not being able to say no, and now I work 2 jobs. I started working at Walmart a few weeks ago. I applied to Walmart because I wanted to quit my job as a barista, because I dislike my coworkers and wanted a more solitary job as a personal shopper. I survive off of 4 hours of sleep everyday trying to work both of these jobs. I‚Äôm terrified of putting my 2 weeks in at my job as a barista and I‚Äôm paying at consequences. I feel soulless. I‚Äôm yawning and struggling at stay awake typing this. I know my thinking and behavioral is irrational, i know people will look at my behavior and raise an eyebrow and say, why would you subject yourself to this. I‚Äôm trying to figure it out myself. This happens in all areas of my life, with my online friends, they make fun of me and I‚Äôm always the butt of the joke in my online friend group. It‚Äôs because I never stand up for myself. With dating, i don‚Äôt want to brag and I want to come off as humble but I‚Äôm aware that I‚Äôm pretty good looking, people have made that clear to me. I get approached by guys almost every time I go out. I get too afraid to say no, I‚Äôve been pressured into sex a few times. Because of my undesirable personality, guys only use me to make me horny then use me and leave. They start ghosting me. One guy even said I was boring. When I see guys that are quiet, shy, and seem kind, I wish I could go up and talk to them, but I‚Äôm too scared. I have no irl friends, I‚Äôm too scared to approach people. Then, in my family, my mom is authoritarian, she wants me to become a nurse even though I have no passion for nursing. So here I am, in January, I will be starting my prerequisites for a nursing program. I‚Äôm gonna end it here because I have 15 minutes before I have to go and clock in at Walmart this sucks I‚Äôm sorry. My life consists of people constantly violating my boundaries, constantly feeling anxiousness, relief, and anticipation. I never feel happiness.

there's not ""heavy"" ""real"" proof to go to the police anyways just that I know because I lived there 3 to 4 months to help mom in her recovery and be a companion for her... anyways I instantly felt something was off when I saw this aunt and the circel of family around   
They're all thieves, when mom arrived on the ambulance she was a little druggie from the meds and when she got to her bed she said ""were are those evil witches, I see them down there doing me something"" (sorry for any mistake I speak spanish) and guess whom where two floors down from us since we were at a family house with 3 floors

the tap water sometimes got BLACK out of nowhere the nurses at least 4 times told me they had to throw the water away because the water was black and I personally have a video on my cellphone of it, the food was poisoning me since I got HEAVY diarrhea

mom refused anyways to move from there like if under a spell and still is under recovery...

I had to go back to my own house to retake Job and not losing it and ever since my mom's stuff like TV's, Money, Ps4 (yes she had a ps4), Laptop, Wii, Coffee maker and MANY MANY MORE got suddenly lost and she continues to refuse me to put a police report on it 

I saw this method that uses a chicken breast and a picture of the ""victim"" to basically end this person's health and therefore life... 

no. I'm not doubting 

Yes, I'm pretty sure I want to do this, I've always believed in energy, magic, vibes and all that, personally i can share that sometimes I play with the wind and the trees on free time so I know this is real and looking for help on finding more about this Chicken breast method or any other method useful to have a reckoning as it has to be since this ""christians"" paint themselves as mere innocent sheeps but are evil incarnated and they think I'm not gonna do anything about it just because my mom asked me to not do a police report cause she says she'll be sad and feel guilty for setting up trouble between me and my aunt family. 

I really hope to get the help I'm looking for 

if I need to do protection spells for myself, husband, son, and mom in order to be safe but MAKE THIS PEOPLE PAY 

Imma do it no matter what, I've been struggling all my life to get what I had just like my mom so it's not fair at all for some dumb fuck to come and grab what they want like it's some kind of ""charity for the thieves""

Be it as it may, I think there's nothing more comforting than having someone be your person. Someone you may bicker with from time to time but your bond will only grow stronger after.

To have someone constantly reassure you that you're enough with their love for you. To have someone to watch movies with at home, go to places with to explore, or sit by at the table with to quietly enjoy your morning coffee with. Someone beside you, and with you. Someone who you cherish and will cherish you for your whole lives. Someone that heals you with their presence and you do the same for them. Someone that loves you unconditionally. Someone you look at and think that they are the only person you'd want to have until your last breath. Your bestfriend. A person you'd be willing to share your secrets and faults with. A person who you'd be happy to give your last piece of fry to. Someone you can annoy and will annoy you back but you'll both still want to sleep next to each other at the end of the night. Someone to go grocery shopping with as you fight about which pasta is better for dinner tonight. Someone you'd willingly take a bullet for, but better yet someone you'd want to live for. Someone you'd constantly strive to be worthy of.

To share love and intimacy with such a constant comfort of a presence. To be loved so healthily. To be cared for unconditionally. 

Parang ang saya 'no? 

I get emotional when I see people like these in love with each other. Not because I'm jealous, but to be so loved and known is something so special and it pulls on the heartstrings to see it from others.

This has to be more than avoidance (lying, stealing, gaslighting, etc), am I crazy..? She says I'm stalking her. ","EDIT: I am not asking for a diagnosis of her at all. I just need some support on if I handled this okay

Sorry, I know this is long. It all feels like important information. I would really love some help. 

Tldr; situationship of over a year that I thought was relatively mutual has apparently been calling me crazy behind my back, saying I'm stalking her and that she can't get rid of me, whereas I thought we were both poasibly doing some type of FA/FA push-pull dance. I blocked her on everything. 

I'm FA (used to be AP before 6 years of family trauma) and my ""partner"" (friend/situationship) was definitely some flavour of avoidant with past trauma.  Either way, I've never been able to tell if it was DA or FA. I'm 27f, she's 39f. We're servers.

We had a confusing situationship for a year and a half, initiated in the beginning by her. We were coworkers, she was ALL in very quickly (texting every day, 24h first date..that's more common than you think for gay women but prob still not super healthy lol) but anyways, there was a day where one night in the middle of the night I slept through some important texts of her being vulnerable and needing emotional support (she wanted me to come over because her sister and sisters BF were fighting badly, first and only time she was vulnerable like this) and started to distance herself after that night, and then ultimately rejected me a few days later but wanted to stay friends ""because she cares about me"". 

I won't go into detail, but the next year and a half has been a wild ride of being a ""barely situationship"" where I never understood where I truly stood with her. Incredibly weird mixed signals, etc. 

(Like, while rejecting me she was very unclear about what she was saying, when I asked for clarification she ignored me for a month, including at work, but later admitted she was hoping I'd notice, but in that period of ignoring me invited me to go camping with her best friend, said I could live with her....she also has inserted me into her life, like she imagined me teaching kids art in her homeschooling pod she dreamed of starting. She told me this during a period where she was blatantly ignoring me at work) 

Her words and actions would often not line up, she would deny things and I felt like I was being gaslit. Whenever I felt so frustrated that I decided the pain wasn't worth it and would try to distance myself (either without saying anything, or by letting her know) she would start to cling on (but not in an extreme way). When I would try to talk things out and tell her she was being confusing/hurtful she would be VERY defensive. 

Her whole thing was basically ""I'm better off alone, forever. I'm too selfish to be in a relationship"". But.. I would come and sleep over a lot, her family knew me and I had dinners with them sometimes etc. She didn't seem to ever be ""seeing"" or have anyone else over but me. In June I helped her family do their gardens, build a pool, etc. 

I was lonely, cared about her, and have a hard time walking away, so I've stayed all this time and just stayed confused. I have CPTSD and I can be naive also. 

This summer was the worst of it, with her now also getting involved with an ex boyfriend from almost 20 years ago (phantom ex?) who she says she's not even attracted to. I wasn't down for being around to see that. I care about her, but I did have feelings and I was hurt. 

She's also been consistently letting me down lately by forgetting plans and such (had 6 hour phone call with her recently, she made plans with me for the next week, and then forgot about them and acted like she didn't care, but then a while later told me she felt ""soooo bad"" about it) 

Anyways, a whole bunch of shit went down this week at work. Her and I have worked there two years. 

She got caught stealing money out of a kids birthday card.. I guess she served a 7 year old boys birthday party, and they accidentally left a card with $50 on it. She was clearing the table, found the money and pocketed it. The family came back less than 10 minutes later and she denied seeing the money or the card. They checked the cameras and basically said look you can either quit or we'll fire you, so she quit. 

I am shocked at this, because she used to work with kids as a camp counselor, absolutely loves and adores her nephew, wants to be a mom, and also calls herself a born again Christian. 

Anyways, me, a coworker who is her friend, and a coworker who is my friend (and who I'd been getting advice from about this situationship) all worked together Tuesday night. 

My situationship was texting us all that she ""found $50 on the ground and her inner child thought it was good luck, but ended up not being good luck"". We were all like, is she really lying about this right now when she was caught on camera? Restaurants talk! I work in the most unprofessional restaurant ever, everything spreads like wildfire. 

Not only that, but she was copying and pasting the same message to all of us (tho I suspect this is because she is dyslexic and didn't want to retype the whole paragraph she was sending). 

So everyone's mad - we're all her friends and feel kinda betrayed, but then I have her friend telling me that for months now she's been going on about how I'm stalking her and she can't get rid of me, and how I'm crazy (and also, that she is ""in love"" with this ex boyfriend, wants to have a baby with him and get married.. shes been seeing him less than a month and also once again, has held the position that she will never ever date, for like almost a decade now.)

The other coworker who is my friend (and who I trust a lot) confirmed and said she had been trying to ask her recently if I was crazy, and kinda gave up when she realized my friend wasn't gonna support that. My friend told her that I'm a passionate, caring person. She told me that my situationship wasn't necessarily saying it in a derogatory way, but more like ""she's crazy right...? She must be"". Like she was anxious about it. 

I was... So upset. I have been trying so hard to be respectful of boundaries and her feelings that I've been shoving myself down into a little box. It was her birthday last month, we were supposed to work together that day, and I had thrifted her a book I thought she would love and wrote a note letting her know her good qualities (she had told me previously she wasn't worth getting to know, maybe I should have listened but I thought she just had trauma and bad self esteem). She wasn't at work so I quickly dropped it by her porch, upon seeing a car parked out front and I assumed randomly it was her ex boyfriend's. I texted her telling her to check her porch, and also that I was sorry for intruding if that was his car (why am I apologizing...? Also it was not his car, in the end. Her family was apparently also asking where I was during her birthday which she did not invite me to. Everyone expected I'd be there) 

Apparently - that was stalker behaviour, and she told another coworker that I must be stalking her. Meanwhile I almost never start conversations with her and let her lead. She told me once I could show up to her house unannounced any time and I told her no way. You wouldn't like that! And she was like ""no I'm serious, I'm here for you always"". I can't imagine if I actually showed up once - she would use that as more proof to say I'm stalking her. 

Anyways, like I said, whenever I try to distance she clings. I told her recently if she really feels like she has no feelings for me anymore, that I didn't want to sleep over at her place anymore (we'd watch movies and then I'd sleep over). She was like ""no no, you can still sleep over, we could have coffee together in the morning...?"" Dude if you feel like you can't get rid of me, just let me leave..? 

And yet - she can't get rid of me?

So after this night, I had enough. I spent the night crafting a huge letter (ended up being two pages front and back if I printed it out) that was kind but firm, and told her how confused and hurt I was by all of this. I let a few very close friends read it, including the coworker that knows her, and they all said it was really good and long overdue, and that my feelings of anger and betrayal were justified, and if anything I have been too kind to her. So I sent it and blocked her on everything. 

And now... I feel bad. I sent it yesterday. I'm so worried that by sending such a long message (I sent it over text, so it looks miles long) that maybe.. I am crazy? 

The anxious side of my FA has been full blown with her, and what if the fact that I've been staying around even through weeks of no contact and hoping we had something, IS crazy?

It was like we would go through these cycles of taking turns pushing each other away, and reconnecting/pulling back in. I thought we were both FA's, maybe. Cause we both have trauma and can't seem to stay close but can't seem to let the other go. But now she's making it out like I've been very unwanted and I haven't been getting the hint.. 

I'm so confused. I don't necessarily regret my decision (she was bringing me so much anxiety and making me feel like I couldn't trust reality) but, still. Could I have done it in a better way? Asked her if she had really said that stuff? She's probably either extremely mad, or freaking out right now, or both. 

To be clear, I KNOW that a relationship with her would not work or be worthwhile now. But as a person I've cared for her for a long time and I'm feeling mixed feelings about how long my message was, especially because she's sensitive to criticism and probably carries a lot of shame.

We began texting almost daily and there will be times I got annoyed with his reply times as I would be left on delivered for 1-2 days,he would complain and say his busy he can't give me all his attention especially at this 'stage'.

Moreover,the one time I didn't text him for 3 days (I did not leave him on delivered like he did),he made an issue out of it and said that when he does it I shouldnt complain.Even though its not at all the same.

Furthermore his really poor at conversation on the phone, if he starts a conversation its a stupid meme or snap or one word and he can never keep a conversation going.

I could overlook the poor texting skills if we continued to see each other in person but apart from snaps i have never gotten to see him apart from that initial meetup,he always finds an excuse when i try to get him to go on casual linkups like coffee,drinks whatever.

Paint, flooring, rug, and sofa slipcovers are new. I was thinking of leaning into lots of bold jewel tones hence the seating but struggling with the vision. (Teal, mustard, sangria, plum, rust?) I'd love to bring in a complimentary pattern for throw pillows or window treatments but not sure what types of patterns to look for that will compliment the rug. (I could spend hours on Spoonflower.) Repainting or different rug/flooring is a no-go. Could entertain a different slipcover color for the sofas. 

Note: The table under the window is going away. TV will be either mounted to the wall or on top of/above the (non-functional) fireplace. I have a basic walnut coffee table that may end up down here as well. The sofa tables in the pic just don't have anywhere else to go right now. Adjoining room is a crafting/gaming space and a WIP. The lighting sucks, I know.
