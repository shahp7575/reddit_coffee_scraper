(Bloomberg) -- The US-China dispute over Beijing’s control of rare earth supplies has yet to be resolved, the head of a visiting US congressional delegation said after meeting Chinese officials, signaling a key irritant persists in bilateral relations.

Representative Adam Smith described continuing challenges on the matter in a press briefing on Tuesday in the Chinese capital, where he’s leading the [first](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-21/china-hosts-us-house-group-as-tiktok-trade-talks-gain-momentum) official visit by US House lawmakers since 2019 as relations steady before a [potential meeting](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-19/xi-asks-trump-to-avoid-taking-restrictive-trade-measures-in-call) between the countries’ presidents.

**“I don’t think we resolved the rare earth question,” Smith said, without specifying what the sticking points are. “I think that that still needs to be worked on.”**

China dominates the global supply and processing of the minerals, which are vital for everything from electric vehicles to advanced weaponry. Beijing has used its position as a [strategic lever](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/china-deploys-rare-earths-as-weapon-in-trade-war-with-trump) as trade tensions with the Trump administration escalated earlier this year.

The two governments reached a framework agreement in June that includes a [Chinese commitment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-27/china-says-it-confirms-trade-framework-details-with-us) to review applications for shipping rare earth magnets, although few details of the deal have been disclosed. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer last week said supplies to his country had “bounced back up significantly,” although European companies have complained about [shortages](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-18/china-rare-earth-product-exports-hit-highest-since-at-least-2012) that threaten to halt production.

Smith also struck a note of caution in response to a reporter’s question about whether Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. will have any role in maintaining the app’s algorithm in the US. Citing privacy and security concerns, he said the matter has “not been 100% resolved,” while adding that he wasn’t privy to the negotiations. 

The US and China are nearing an agreement to hive off the US operations of social media platform TikTok to a consortium that includes software giant Oracle Corp. Under the spin-off arrangement being discussed, TikTok will be majority-owned and controlled by Americans, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Many of the finer details of the agreement have yet to be made public.

Joined by US Ambassador to China David Perdue, the delegation’s visit may build more goodwill ahead of a possible sitdown between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping next month in South Korea. 

The world’s two largest economies are in the [final stages](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-23/us-china-talks-for-huge-boeing-aircraft-order-in-final-stages) of negotiations for a “huge” Boeing Co. aircraft order, Perdue said at the briefing. Such a deal, which has been years in the making, would be the centerpiece of a trade agreement between the two nations but has been contingent on an easing in tensions.

On the security front, Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, urged Beijing to engage in talks over its “rapidly growing nuclear arsenal” to prevent miscalculation. 

“When you’re getting up into the hundreds, close to 1,000 on nuclear weapons, it’s time to start having a conversation about it to make sure that we understand each other,” Smith said. He stressed the need for better military-to-military dialogue, a message he delivered in meetings with Chinese officials including Premier Li Qiang since the delegation arrived on Sunday. 

During the trip, the US delegation has also discussed the flow of fentanyl and called for fair [access](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-22/us-lawmakers-call-for-more-defense-talks-in-rare-china-visit) to China’s market for US firms.

The group is scheduled to meet with National People’s Congress Chairman Zhao Leji and Foreign Minister Wang Yi later on Tuesday, Vice Premier He Lifeng said Monday.

# SEPT. 23, 2025~Australian critical minerals firms flock to US opportunities

[Australian critical minerals firms flock to US opportunities | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/australian-critical-minerals-firms-flock-us-opportunities-2025-09-23/)

* **Australian rare earths, graphite firms eye US expansion**
* **Large, developed customer base is key attraction**
* **Investors show interest in critical minerals projects, execs say**

MELBOURNE, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Some of Australia's most advanced critical minerals producers are moving forward on plans to build processing facilities in the United States, despite Australia's strategic push to build up its own domestic industry. An Australian delegation of critical minerals companies visited Washington and New York last week to meet senior administration officials and investors. ASX-listed firms including Australian Strategic Materials [(ASM.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ASM.AX), Ionic Rare Earths [(IXR.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/IXR.AX), and International Graphite [(IG6.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/IG6.AX) are looking to expand in the U.S., company executives told Reuters.

The scale of the U.S. customer base is a major attraction, they said, given its rapidly developing electric vehicle, defence, and advanced manufacturing industries, as well as cheap energy and the hefty subsidies it is set to deploy. ""We've identified six states as ones that we're looking at seriously,"" said Chief Legal Officer Annaliese Eames of ASM, which is seeking to expand beyond its rare earths metallization plant in Korea. Of those states, ASM, an $85 million firm, is conducting detailed due diligence, including reviewing sites, in Oklahoma and South Carolina. What drew ASM to the U.S. was more than strong federal and state support and incentives. ""It's the commitment that they're making to grow the entire ecosystem,"" she said.

Some critical minerals firms that supply to customers in defense need to locate nearby for reasons of national security and the series of complex steps in turning raw materials into magnets used in everything from wind power to missiles. That is the case for Ionic Rare Earths, which is planning to replicate the magnet recycling technology it has developed in Belfast in several U.S. states, including Tennessee, where it is in advanced discussions, Managing Director Tim Harrison said. ""There are a number of other states that can provide very low cost of power... They also have a lower labor cost base and they have both federal and state governments that are willing to deploy immense funding,"" he told [Reuters.International](http://Reuters.International) Graphite, which is building an advanced processing plant in Western Australia, is also looking at options to build in the U.S. and Europe, to be more closely aligned to the specific requirements of its customers, CEO Andrew Worland said. China's restrictions on rare earths exports [in April](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/) galvanized the U.S. to supercharge its rare earths industry, and higher Western world prices that have emerged are attracting investors and greasing the wheels of project finance. Even so, acess to U.S. funding is expected to be highly competitive. Australia's Lynas Rare Earths [(LYC.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LYC.AX), the biggest supplier outside China, warned last month that its heavy rare-earths processing plant in Texas may not go ahead after the Trump administration provided multibillion dollar funding to its U.S. rival.

# POLICY CHALLENGES

The trend highlights critical policy challenges in Australia that are impeding the government's ambition to develop new export markets beyond its mainstay fossil fuels. That opportunity was worth A$170 billion ($112 billion) to its economy by 2040, according to a PwC report as recently as 2023.""Australia has been struggling to set up the critical minerals industry beyond primary extraction,"" PwC Australia chief economist Amy Lomas said. Australia's high power and labor costs, and a cumbersome approvals process, are dragging on growth and diminishing the country's international competitiveness, major miners regularly [complain](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/bhp-flags-organic-copper-growth-us-allure-silent-big-buyouts-2025-09-15/). Meanwhile, advanced manufacturing is still a small sector, its development clipped by the closure of Australia's car industry in the 2010s.""For an Australian company to look at building it in Australia, where do we sell our materials? Where is the metals, alloys, magnet capacity being built? It’s not being built in Australia because our cost base is too expensive and we have minimal advanced manufacturing industry,"" Ionic's Harrison said. Still, Australia passed a A$17 billion production tax credit in February that will provide a 10% offset for critical minerals processors from 2027. It is also building critical minerals partnerships with allies including Japan, India and Britain that could deepen its customer base, PwC's Lomas added. ""Then that starts to set the foundations for Australia to be able to run a lot harder typically for midstream processing, and then ideally downstream processing,"" she said.

**American Rare Earths (** [**(AU:ARR)**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:arr?utm_source=msn.com&utm_medium=referral) **) just unveiled an announcement.**

American Rare Earths has completed test mining and primary crushing of approximately 3,080 tonnes of rare earth ore at the Cowboy State Mine, part of the Halleck Creek deposit. The company is conducting comminution optimization tests on 13.7 tonnes of ore samples to improve rare earth magnet element recoveries and project economics. The remaining ore will be used as feedstock for a demonstration plant, which will validate processing methods and support future technical studies. These efforts are expected to enhance the company’s position in the domestic permanent magnet industry and increase stakeholder confidence.

# SEPT. 22nd, 2025~US buys scandium oxide from Rio Tinto

[US buys scandium oxide from Rio Tinto](https://www.financial-world.org/news/news/financial/28947/us-buys-scandium-oxide-from-rio-tinto/)

https://preview.redd.it/v2wsy6wlxvqf1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=f44f8a5f123757f6819aa59df812be17fbe3b19b

**The Logistics Agency of the US Ministry of Defense (DLA) plans to buy scandium oxide worth up to 40 million dollars from a branch of the mining company Rio Tinto in the next five years.** The goal is to replenish strategic stocks for military and technological needs. Scandium is one of the rare earth minerals, and its role in military devices and advanced technology is crucial. Currently, the largest producer is China, which has introduced strict export controls.

""Until recently, we sourced scandium primarily from China. In late 2024, China introduced scandium export controls that limited the supply chain and prompted us to purchase for National Defense supplies,"" according to a DLA document released last week. 

**The plan is to buy a total of 6.4 tons of scandium oxide in the next five years, which in the first year amounts to almost two tons or about five percent of last year's total global production. Last year, according to the data of the American Geological Survey, 40 tons of scandium oxide were produced, with a total capacity of 80 tons.**

**In order to encourage domestic production, the US in August granted $10 million to Elk Creek Resources, an arm of the mining company NioCorp Developments, which plans to produce scandium in Nebraska. Until then, America had to import metal from abroad, and Rio Tinto was the only seller capable of meeting the state's needs in the required quantities.**

The management of the British-Australian company refused to comment on business details, **but it was pointed out that it is ""actively working with the US government to explore opportunities and take advantage of government support for greater domestic production and stabilization of the supply chain"".** In 2020, Rio Tinto researchers developed a process to extract high-purity scandium oxide from the waste streams of titanium dioxide production.

The company in Quebec, Canada, has been producing scandium oxide for three years, and the current capacity is three tons per year. ""Rio Tinto is in a unique position and can help supply materials critical to America's future,"" management told Reuters.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

# 📌 DFARS, Defense Primes & Scandium: Why the Timing Matters

The Reuters scoop (Sept. 22) confirms the Defense Logistics Agency just opened a $40M, 5-year scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto to shore up the National Defense Stockpile. **But even more important — it explicitly cites the $10M U.S. award to Elk Creek Resources (NioCorp) in August to accelerate domestic scandium production.**

**Here’s why it matters: under DFARS (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), U.S. primes (Lockheed, RTX, Northrop, etc.) must prioritize secure, domestic, non-adversary sources for critical minerals. Rio Tinto can provide a stopgap, but it’s Canadian, limited in scale, and lacks downstream alloying. NioCorp is the only U.S. upstream solution with a mine-to-alloy roadmap, and Mark Smith already confirmed (Sept. 8 Wainwright event) that two ScAl alloy pathways + a defense partnership announcement are slated for November.**

# CMMC Final Rule: Key Takeaways for Defense Contractors

# [https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/advisor](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/advisories/2025/09/cmmc-final-rule-key-takeaways-for-defense-contractors)

# IMHO~The Bottom Line:

# The U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) just paid a contract price of $6,250/kg!— a strong benchmark for federal price support.*

**This pricing level is especially significant for NioCorp, which received a $10 million U.S. award in August to accelerate domestic scandium production. Unlike other suppliers, NioCorp plans to vertically integrate: producing scandium oxide, refining it into metal, and alloying it into Scandium-Aluminum (ScAl) alloys —** the form required by defense and aerospace primes under DFARS regulations. That integrated pathway allows NioCorp to potentially capture a similar material pricing (\~$6,250/kg) but also additional alloy-level premiums moving forward.

**In short, the DLA contract sets a price floor, confirms real demand, and validates the economics behind NioCorp’s business model. With federal buyers already valuing scandium this highly and policy driving secure domestic sourcing, NioCorp’s mine-to-alloy strategy is aligned perfectly to meet DFARS-compliant defense demand!**

# The Setup Before the Strike

Tomorrow kicks off NioCorp’s biggest showcase week in years: the **RedChip investor presentation at 4:15 PM EST (Sept. 24)** followed by **Mark Smith live with Maria Bartiromo at 7:30 AM EST (Sept. 25)**. That sequence is deliberate — first Retail, Wall Street and institutions get the technical roadmap, then the very next morning the retail base and national audience hear the story on Fox Business. It’s a one-two punch engineered to maximize visibility.

But the real kicker dropped this week: **Reuters confirmed that the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency just awarded Rio Tinto a $40M scandium oxide contract (6.4 tonnes over five years)**, paying the equivalent of **\~$6,250/kg Sc₂O₃** (≈$9,600/kg scandium metal-equivalent). **That sets a** ***price floor*** **for Scandium in defense supply chains —** and with NioCorp potentially funded to advance utilities and site prep, **and with Mark Smith openly teasing Scandium alloy partnerships and November announcements, the timing could not be sharper.** Elk Creek is positioned to be **the only U.S. upstream source of Scandium** at scale, meaning the DLA’s stopgap with Rio Tinto is just that — a bridge until domestic supply comes online.

Put together, the picture is clear: **Phase 1 drilling complete with assays due mid-October, Scandium alloy breakthroughs lined up for November, and a Q4 DFS that folds in all upside just as EXIM/DFC financing comes to a head.** Against a backdrop of new federal critical mineral funding and active Pentagon stockpiling, NioCorp isn’t just a niobium play anymore — it’s becoming the cornerstone of a **North American multi-metal critical minerals complex.** Translation: the table is set, the catalysts are stacked, and starting tomorrow, the ignition sequence begins.

🚀 **Bottom line:** **Elk Creek is no longer “just a mine.” It’s shaping into the U.S. Resource Independence Keystone — Scandium, Niobium, Titanium, and rare earths all under one roof.**

# — and it’s clear: NioCorp isn’t just about magnets. It’s part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Solution!

# — A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2029 and beyond.

# NioCorp = ""The Flagship U.S. source for multiple Critical Minerals!”

I know exactly what you mean about that chalky film. I used to see it every time I boiled water for tea in my old apartment. It looked like someone had dusted the inside of the kettle with powdered sugar, but it certainly didn't make the water taste any sweeter. I remember staring at it, wondering if it was the same stuff that sometimes left a weird film on top of my coffee.



It got me thinking about my grandma, who always swore by the taste of water from her well. She never had that problem, but our city water seemed to be full of minerals. I learned that the white residue is mostly just calcium and magnesium—basically, harmless hardness in the water. But even knowing it wasn't dangerous, the texture and the idea of it floating around in my drink just didn't sit right with me. It felt like my water wasn't as clean as it could be.



Then a friend mentioned she used a simple jug with a filter for her cooking water. I decided to try it, mostly out of curiosity. The first time I filled the kettle with water that had passed through it, I didn't notice much difference. But after a few boils, I peeked inside. The bottom was completely clear, no more white dusting in sight.



It was such a small thing, but it made my morning routine feel a little lighter. The water for my tea just tastes… cleaner now, without that slight mineral aftertaste. It’s nice to have one less little mystery floating in my cup.

It was a frustrating experience. Made me wonder if I should throw this damn table out instead of dealing with the people messaging me 

Price and dimensions were in the title and description. Pick up only. Also had photos with the measuring tape 

I make sure to give them an address (public meeting spot), photos of the place, and a video of the location. 

Here are some interactions I had through messages: 

* Someone showed up at 3AM and got upset when I wasn’t there for pickup. I thought they were no show since we agreed to meet at 2pm. I did not hear from them until 3AM. Did not meet with them
* Gave them the meeting location and they were upset with me because they went to the wrong place
* Asked me for my star sign. Said they did not want to meet with me because she could feel the evil energy coming from her screen. Said her bracelets will protect her from me 
* Got mad at me when I told them it was pick up only. Thought I would be the one to arrange and pay a taxi for them 
* Death threats, rape threats, telling me they would beat me up. The usual. 
* Told someone I could meet with them from 12-4pm. Had dinner plans after. They showed up several hours late and got upset that I wasn’t home 
* Looked at the table and decided they didn’t want it. Which is fine. But she asked me if I sold Korean makeup. I do not 
* Asked me to get them a different table when we met in person because they didn’t like it 
* Showed up on a day when I told them I wasn’t free that day. Lots of angry messages 
* One person messaged me several times  throughout the day. I was at work so I couldn’t answer. When I did they blew up at me. Death and rape threats. Blocked. 
* Someone asked me the dimensions and I told them it was in the listing and description. They were very upset I didn’t just tell them since they were right there 
* Wanted me to deliver it to them for free. They were located 1.5 hours away. Was upset when I said no
* Asked for photos. I took 10 photos. It’s in the listing. Upset I did not send them photos 
* Asked me how much it was. Again it is in the description 
* Asked me the color of the table. Is it green? No it’s a black table. Literally in the photos. What?? 
* Asked me what I was selling. It’s in the title and description. I have photos posted too 
* Was upset I didn’t accept their offer of $1
* Said they had cancer and that I should just give it to the ones who need it the most

Two women, maybe mid-40s or 50s, sat next to us. At first they looked so put-together. Effortless hair, cutting sandwiches with a knife and fork, casually saying “Vijay bhaiyyaaa please app unko receive karlo” like it was part of the menu. They were talking about art exhibitions near Kala Ghoda and how certain paintings bring out “true human emotions.” 

I leaned over to my friend and said, “That’s the life I want when I grow older.”

But then came the twist. Over their course-by-course meal, with dessert before coffee, the conversation went straight from art to gossip marathons. Andrew was apparently divorced and miserable, someone else was flirting too much, and their relatives were torn apart one by one.

The final straw was when they mentioned someone who had passed away. Instead of memories or grief, they were stressed about not having a good Hindi memorial song. “We had enough English ones but Hindi na…” and that broke me a little.

It was jarring. Here were women who could spend an hour talking about how art reflects humanity, but in the same breath laughed off mental health struggles and mocked divorces while eating white chocolate.

It was enough to make me want to just stick with my expensive cable.

But then I found a name that kept popping up from real people, not just fancy ads: [IPTVUNLOCK](https://IPTVUNLOCK.com). I decided to give their **IPTV service** a try, and honestly, it was a game-changer for me. This is my honest experience. I’m not getting paid to say this; I’m just a regular guy who found a good thing and wants to share it.

# What is IPTV, Anyway? (In Simple Words)

Before I talk about [IPTVUNLOCK](https://IPTVUNLOCK.com), let me explain what IPTV is, because I needed it explained to me. IPTV stands for Internet Protocol Television. That’s a mouthful, right? Forget that. Just think of it as TV channels and movies that come to you through the internet, instead of through a cable wire or a satellite dish.

You use an app on your phone, your TV, your Amazon Fire Stick, or your computer. That app connects to the **IPTV service provider’s** big list of channels, and you can watch whatever you want. It’s like having the whole world of television in one place. The right **IPTV service** can give you thousands of channels from all over the globe for a lot less money than cable. That’s the whole point.

# Why I Stuck with IPTVUNLOCK After Trying a Few

Like I said, I tried a couple of other **IPTV services** before this one. They were okay, but they had problems. The picture would freeze in the middle of a big game. The channel I wanted to watch would just be offline. Or, the whole thing was just too complicated to set up.

When I signed up for **IPTVUNLOCK**, the first thing I noticed was how easy it was. I went to their website, [**IPTVUNLOCK.**](https://IPTVUNLOCK.com). It’s clean and simple. I didn’t have to call anyone or talk to a salesperson. I just picked a plan for my **IPTV subscription**. They have different options, which is great. You can get a trial, a one-month plan, a three-month plan, or even longer. I started with a month to test it out.

The sign-up process for this **IPTV service provider** was quick. I got an email almost right away with my username, password, and a link to download their app. The app is called “IPTV Smarters Pro,” which is a very common app that works with many **IPTV providers**. Downloading it was easy from the app store on my Fire Stick.

# The Real Test: What It’s Like to Actually Use It

This is where **IPTVUNLOCK** really won me over. After I put my login details into the app, the channel list loaded. And wow, what a list. We’re talking about every channel you can imagine. All the local USA channels, sports channels from every country, news, movies, kids’ channels… everything. If you are looking for a **best IPTV subscription** with a huge selection, this is it.

Here’s what makes it a **best IPTV service** for me:

1. **It Actually Works:** This is the most important thing. The streams are reliable. When I click on a channel, it starts playing fast. I’ve watched entire football games without a single freeze. With other **IPTV services** I tried, buffering was a constant problem. With **IPTVUNLOCK**, it’s rare. For me, a reliable **IPTV service provider** is worth its weight in gold.
2. **The Picture is Clear:** The video quality is really good. Most channels are in high definition (HD). It looks just as good as my old cable TV, if not better. You don’t get that blurry, pixelated picture that makes you squint.
3. **It’s Easy to Use:** The guide is simple. You can look through channels by country or by category (like Sports, Entertainment, etc.). You can also set up a list of your favorite channels so you don’t have to scroll through thousands every time. For someone who isn’t tech-savvy, this was a huge relief. A good **IPTV provider** makes the experience easy, and they do.
4. **The Price is Unbeatable:** Let’s talk numbers. My old cable bill was over $150 a month. For what? A **IPTVUNLOCK** subscription costs a small fraction of that. For the price of a couple of cups of coffee a month, you get access to more TV than you could ever watch. When people search for **“best IPTV 2025”** they are often looking for a great value, and this is it.
5. **Great for Sports:** If you’re a sports fan, this is paradise. I can watch games that my cable package never offered. All the big league games, plus international sports I never knew existed. It’s incredible.

# What About the “IPTV Sub” and VOD?

You’ll see the term **“IPTV sub”** which is just a short way of saying **IPTV subscription**. Getting your **IPTV sub** from **IPTVUNLOCK** is straightforward. You pay, you get your login info, and you’re good to go. No hidden fees.

They also have a massive Video on Demand (VOD) library. This is like having Netflix, Hulu, and everything else built right in. Thousands of movies and full TV series are available to watch anytime you want. So it’s not just live channels; it’s a complete entertainment package.

# Is It Really the Best IPTV Provider?

I can’t speak for every service out there. But from my experience, and after wasting time and money on a few others, **IPTVUNLOCK** is definitely a top contender for the title of **the best iptv**. It does what it promises to do. It gives you a huge number of channels, it’s reliable, it’s easy to use, and it’s affordable.

When you look at **best IPTV providers**, you have to look at the whole package. It’s not just about who has the most channels. It’s about who gives you a service that works well every day. For me, that’s **IPTVUNLOCK**. They are a solid **IPTV service provider** that I feel I can trust.

If you’re looking for **iptv services** and you’re tired of the high cost and limited choices of cable, I highly recommend you check them out. They offer a trial, so you can see for yourself without a big commitment. That’s the best way to know if any **IPTV service** is right for you.

# My Final Word

Cutting the cord was one of the best decisions I made for my wallet. And finding **IPTVUNLOCK** made it a great decision for my TV watching too. I don’t feel like I’m missing out on anything. In fact, I have more options than ever before.

If you’re searching for **“best iptv service”** or **“iptv subscriptions”**, my advice is to stop getting overwhelmed by all the choices. Go to [**IPTVUNLOCK**](https://IPTVUNLOCK.com), take their trial, and see what you think. For the price and the performance, I think you’ll be as happy with it as I am. It’s a simple solution for anyone who just wants to watch good TV without a lot of fuss.",1,1758621860.0,HOUSFULL,0,1.0,False

1nod9v4,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1nod9v4/struggling_as_a_student/,Struggling as a student,"So I’m a student who recently started highschool and I’ve been struggling with insomnia pretty much my whole life but it got significantly worse around seventh grade (not stress related it just happened) so we went to the doctor and is tarted taking melatonin around a year ago- but only after my parents made me try every herbal remedy possible.

Firstly, and I know another post addresses this, but WHY DO NO DOCTORS TAKE ME SERIOUSLY? Granted, I am a child and my insomnia is chronic but fairly mild compared to what others seem to be going through. But melatonin was suggested after visits with three separate doctors INCLUDING A NEUROLOGIST BECAUSE MY EMT THOUGHT I HAD NARCOLEPSY. And melatonin is not a long term solution- I’ve already had to double my dose. Every doctor seems to assume that I just stay up late playing games or something, or that I should have better sleep hygiene, or exercise more (but where is the time or energy??!!)

So on to my main point- I’m struggling to get through my (insanely long) school day plus co curriculars plus revision etc. And I’m depending on caffeine to do it - one cup of matcha or coffee a day otherwise I WILL collapse (it’s happened before). At this age, I know that caffeine is really bad for me but if I’m struggling with the help of coffee, how am I expected to survive without it? I was hoping someone else might have gone through something similar.",1,1758621656.0,insomnia,2,0.99,False
1nod9gy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1nod9gy/we_stopped_for_gas_in_the_adirondeck_mountains/,We stopped for gas in the Adirondeck Mountains. What we saw was horrifying.,"The Adirondack Northway is a stretch of Interstate 87 in New York that runs from Albany all the way to the Canadian border in Champlain. Its most rural sections begin after passing through Lake George in Warren County. The road narrows, curves more often, and exits become increasingly sparse. Cell service is almost nonexistent, and driving there can make you feel like you’re slipping out of time.

I was 17 and had just finished my junior year of high school. Around the same time, I finally received my graduated driver’s license. In other words, no more curfew. To celebrate, a few buddies and I decided to take a road trip through the Adirondacks, driving north for maybe an hour or so and then turning around and heading back, just for the hell of it. We’d grown up in Albany, only about an hour from the gateway to the mountains, so it felt like the perfect mini adventure. There were only four of us: me, a rising seinor; Cody, another rising seinor; Tom, a rising junior; and Sammy, a rising freshman we befriended a few weeks before at our high school’s welcoming orientation. While Sammy was the youngest, Tom was the most impulsive of the group. 

We left later than expected, around 6:30 PM. We drove for a while, taking in the views and gradually watching the sun dip below the horizon. 

Driving these roads during the day is relatively safe as long as you don’t speed on the curvy sections. During the night, however, it’s a completely different world. The road isn’t lit at all, and your only source of light besides your high beams are the minimal number of cars driving around you. It feels quite eerie, almost surreal. 

We were laughing, sharing dark jokes with each other, talking about girls we liked, sharing our disdain for AP classes, etc. It was all typical teen behavior. Everything was fun and games until the orange “Please Refuel” warning sign abruptly appeared right in front of me on the small screen behind the steering wheel. We only had 30 miles left. Sammy checked our location, and realized that by our own carelessness, we had traveled over 250 miles away from home for nearly 3 hours. 

Tom played it off as inconsequential as a knot began to form in my chest, while Sammy frantically began searching google maps for the nearest exit. Just as he was about to make a suggestion, a sign appeared on the right, advertising amenities right off of an exit 39S in a town called New France. 

The road connecting the town to the interstate ramp was nearly deserted, but that didn’t surprise us in the slightest. After all, we had traveled far north, well beyond where traffic thins and silence settles in. We made a right turn and began scanning the roadside for the Mobil station we’d seen advertised on the blue sign just before exiting the Northway.

After roughly three miles, a small—though unmistakably present—gas station appeared on our right. It had just two pumps, but since we were the only ones there, it hardly mattered. Beside the pumps stood a modest Mobil Mart, equipped with a single bathroom and a few shelves lined with the usual assortment of unhealthy snacks you’d expect to find at an average off-the-highway rest stop.
We were only there to get gas, but Tom—despite having already eaten an absurd amount at dinner—insisted on grabbing a variety of snacks he’d spotted through the window. Without a second thought, he headed inside to use the bathroom and make his purchases. Meanwhile, we finished pumping in no time and were finally ready to hit the road again, bracing ourselves for the inevitable lecture from our parents the following day.

Pacing ourselves, we all got back in the car and waited for Tom to return. Five minutes passed. Then ten. Then fifteen. Then twenty. Eventually, Sammy called him, only to be greeted by the overly cheesy voicemail message everyone knew and (for some reason) loved.

“Stop messing around and get back here,” he shouted into the phone before hanging up, clearly annoyed.

We gave it another ten minutes. When there was still no sign of Tom, I finally decided to go in and drag him out myself. 

The inside of the store was fairly typical—fluorescent lights humming overhead, shelves lined with snacks and travel essentials, a faint smell of coffee that had been sitting too long. What was unsettling, though, was the complete absence of a cashier. Even at night, there’s usually at least one person behind the counter, half-watching a small TV or scrolling through their phone. But here, the place was silent. Empty. Unmanned. There wasn’t even any music playing. 

Before I could think of how to reciprocate, the lights illuminating both the store and the gas station all shut off at once, plunging the other boys and I all into complete darkness. My heart began pounding as I called Tom’s name, over and over again without any response. 

I went back to the car to find my friends hyperventilating, begging for us to leave. They claimed that right after I had entered the store, a shadowy figure had followed me inside right before the power went out. Just as I was about to self-righteously assert how it would be completely wrong for us to leave Tom alone here deserted, we then heard a low, deep, but audible growl coming behind the store. 

Without thinking, I floored the accelerator and drove back to where I believed the interstate ramp was located. However, after driving for 15 minutes straight, it was still nowhere to be seen. I decided to pull over on the shoulder and conduct some research on where exactly we were. 

Using the one bar of service I had left, I tried to do some quick research on where exactly we were. Strangely, there were almost no references to any place called “New France” this far north—but we brushed it off, assuming the town was just too remote, too peripheral to have much of an online footprint.

Eventually, I pulled up a travel guide for I-87 and scrolled straight to the exit list. That’s when my stomach dropped.

There was no Exit 39S.

There was a 39N. Even a 39E. But no mention—anywhere—of a 39S, or of any town called New France.

Suddenly, the air felt colder. The mountains stood too still. And the trees… they seemed to be curving, ever so slightly, toward the road.

Before I could react, I saw a figure walking along the road. He was still a fair distance from the car, but close enough to make out some details.

I raised my phone and zoomed in with the camera—and that’s when the horror set in.

The figure was wearing Tom’s face.

Not just looked like him—wore his face.

But it wasn’t Tom. The gait was all wrong—stiff, almost puppet-like—and the figure was too tall, his limbs moving just a bit too mechanically, like someone mimicking a human walk without fully understanding how it worked.

Before I could react, it began to smile.

Not a friendly smile—no. This was something else entirely. A twisted, sinister grin, the kind you’d expect from a cartoon villain—exaggerated, wrong, almost theatrical.

But this wasn’t a cartoon. This was real—something pulled straight from what internet weirdos like to call the uncanny valley: a being that looked almost human, but not quite. Just close enough to fool your brain at first glance… and wrong enough to make your skin crawl the moment you really saw it.

Then I heard it.

A deafening scream—inhuman, guttural, and impossibly loud—ripped through the air as the thing started sprinting toward the car.
I slammed my foot on the gas, and the car lurched forward, tires screeching as we sped down the road—running straight over the Tom-facade in the process. There was a sickening thump, but I didn’t dare look back.

Inside the car, everyone was crying. Sobbing, really. We just wanted Tom back. We just wanted to be home—safe, in our own beds, pretending none of this had ever happened.

I kept driving, trying to focus, trying not to fall apart—until another realization hit me like ice water.

When I filled the tank earlier, I had 340 miles of range. I was sure of it.
Now? I was down to 90.
And we’d only been driving for thirty minutes.

I also realized that I distinctly remember having left the gas station at 10:30. The clock in my car still read that exact same time. 

Now, I was more desperate than ever to escape whatever we’d fallen into—but it was no longer just about the town. It was the mountains themselves.
It didn’t feel like we were lost anymore.

It felt like we’d crossed a threshold—stepped over some invisible border and entered into someone else’s dominion. And whatever ruled here didn’t care who we were. It only cared that we’d entered.

And now, it wasn’t letting go.

I had stopped driving. The gas gage was gradually getting closer and closer to E. 

That’s when we heard footsteps. We turned, and Tom at the edge of the clearing. But it wasn’t Tom. Not really.

He was tall now—too tall—his limbs stretched just a little too far, his shoulders crooked, like they’d been broken and never set right. His skin looked almost like skin, but waxy and pulled tight, as if his body had forgotten how to hold itself together. His face… God. It was Tom’s face, but wrong. The smile was too wide. The eyes were glassy, unfocused. It was like staring at a mannequin’s approximation of someone we had once loved.

He took a step forward and then spoke. 

“I asked it to let you go,” he said. “And it said yes. But I have to stay.”

He paused, his voice shaking, not from fear—but from something deeper. Surrender.

“Don’t come looking for me. And once I’m gone… leave. Immediately. Or it’ll change its mind.”

He looked at each of us, his face flickering like a worn projection trying to hold still.

“This place was never ours to enter. And I… I’m the price for our disrespect.”

He reached into his coat and handed us a folded map—old, creased, and slightly damp, as if it had passed through many hands before his. He didn’t explain it. He didn’t need to. Somehow, we understood: this was our way out.

Then, without another word, Tom turned. His movement was slow, almost mechanical, as if his body didn’t quite remember how to walk the way it once did. He trotted into the woods, his frame swallowed by the trees—and we never saw him again.

We unfolded the map under the dome light of the car. It showed roads none of us had ever heard of—no Waze results, no pins on Google Maps, nothing recognizable to any GPS system. But it was clear. Intentional. Marked with a path we could follow.

And so we did.

We followed the paper map down winding, narrow mountain roads that didn’t seem like they should exist—unmarked intersections, faded trail signs, cracked asphalt buried in leaves. But we kept going, and just when it felt like we might vanish into the trees again…

We saw it.

A dark blue sign. White letters. 87.

I didn’t even think. I slammed my foot on the gas and tore up the ramp, tires spitting gravel behind us as we surged back onto the freeway.

Back into the real world.

We got home very early in the morning. Our parents scolded for staying out too late, but our car privileges thankfully still remained intact. Nothing unusual.

However, what disturbed us most wasn’t what happened in the woods. It was what came after.

No one questioned Tom’s disappearance. No police reports. No missing posters. No calls from worried parents.

In fact, nobody seemed to remember Tom at all. Not classmates. Not teachers. Not even his own parents. When we mentioned his name, they just blinked—confused, polite, and distant, like we’d brought up a stranger.

It was as if Tom had been erased, not just from the world, but from memory itself. Like the price he paid wasn’t just his life, but the right to have ever been.

Even the photos on our phones had changed—group shots where his face was once clear now had empty space, or the edge of a jacket with no body attached. Text threads with his name were gone. Playlists he made disappeared.

Only we remembered. And even now, I can feel those memories starting to fade. Not all at once—but like a slow leak. Quiet. Inevitable.

The last we ever heard from him—or whatever took him—came a few weeks after it was all over.

It arrived in the mail. No return address. No postage stamp. Just a single envelope, aged and weather-warped, as if it had taken a long, unnatural route to reach us.

Inside was one line, handwritten in uneven ink:

“Stay out of our territory.”

Charlie Harper, in his silk robe, pours coffee. Alan Harper enters, looking frazzled, carrying a backpack. Jake Harper, 10, sits at the table, munching on cereal that's mostly sugar.

ALAN:
Charlie, I need a favor. Judith is on my case about Jake's school project. It's this ""family heritage"" thing—build a model of your ancestors' homeland or something. I was thinking we could use some of your old liquor boxes for a diorama.

CHARLIE:
Alan, my liquor boxes are for liquor. Besides, our ancestors were probably drunks who built dioramas out of empty bottles. Why not just tell the teacher Jake's heritage is ""divorced and dysfunctional""?

JAKE:
(mouth full) Dad, can we make it out of pizza boxes? Our family loves pizza!

ALAN:
No, Jake. Pizza boxes smell like failure. We'll use recyclables. It's educational and free.

Charlie's phone buzzes. He checks it and smirks.

CHARLIE:
Speaking of free, I have a date tonight. Met her at the coffee shop. She's a yoga instructor—flexible, spiritual, the whole package.

ALAN:
Yoga? You? The only downward dog you know involves a bar stool.

CHARLIE:
Hey, I'm evolving. Her name's Lana. She's into ""mindful living."" No more one-night stands for me. This could be the start of something... bendy.
Jake burps loudly.

JAKE:
Can I come? I like yoga. It's like playing Twister without the spinner.

CHARLIE:
Kid, yoga with you would be like downward-facing disaster. Stay home and build your beanstalk or whatever.

ALAN:
It's a heritage project, not Jack and the Beanstalk.

JAKE:
Beans? We could plant beans! That's heritage—our family farts a lot.
Charlie and Alan exchange looks. Laughter track.

Alan and Jake are on the floor, surrounded by glue, paper, and what looks like a sad attempt at a model village made from toilet paper rolls.

ALAN:
See, Jake? This represents our Scottish roots. The rolls are bagpipes.

JAKE:
They look like poop tubes.

ALAN:
They're cultural. Now, hand me the glitter. No, not the edible kind—wait, why do we have edible glitter?
Berta enters, vacuuming loudly.

BERTA:
Because Charlie uses it on his dates. Makes 'em sparkle before he makes 'em disappear.

ALAN:
Berta, please. This is a father-son bonding moment.

BERTA:
Looks more like a craft store threw up. Kid, if you want real heritage, I'll tell you about my ex-husbands. One was Scottish—played the bagpipes till I hit him with 'em.

JAKE:
Cool! Did he fart music?

Berta laughs. Alan sighs.

ALAN:
Jake, focus. If this project isn't A-plus, Judith will blame me for your ""lack of creativity."" She's already threatening to cut my alimony if you flunk art.

JAKE:
But Dad, art's dumb. Why can't we just buy a model online?

ALAN:
Because that's cheating! And expensive. We're Harpers—we improvise.

Cut to Charlie entering, dressed up for his date.

CHARLIE:
How's the masterpiece coming? Looks like a homeless village for squirrels.

ALAN:
It's evolving. Like your love life.

CHARLIE:
Touché. Wish me luck—Lana's picking me up. No kids, no brothers, just zen and zen-some.

Doorbell rings. Charlie answers. Lana, a stunning yoga instructor in leggings, enters.

LANA:
Namaste, Charlie. Ready for some chakra alignment?

CHARLIE:
Absolutely. My chakras are wide open.
Jake wanders over, covered in glue.

JAKE:
Hi! Are you Uncle Charlie's bendy friend? Can you touch your toes to your head?

LANA:
(laughing) Adorable. And who's this little yogi?

CHARLIE:
My nephew, Jake. He's... sticky.

JAKE:
Wanna see my poop tubes?
Lana looks confused. Alan rushes in.

ALAN:
Jake! That's not—hi, I'm Alan. The brother. We're just... crafting.

LANA:
Family time! How mindful. Charlie didn't mention he had a nephew.

CHARLIE:
It's a recent development. Like a rash.

Laughter track.

[ACT TWO]
INT. CHARLIE'S BEACH HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

Charlie and Lana are at the table, trying to have a romantic dinner. Candles, wine. But Alan and Jake are in the background, arguing over the project.

ALAN:
(whisper-yelling) Jake, you can't glue beans to the model! It's not a beanstalk!

JAKE:
But you said improvise! And beans are Scottish, right? Haggis has beans?

ALAN:
No, haggis has sheep guts! Now the whole thing smells like a fart factory.
Lana overhears, giggling.

LANA:
Charlie, your family is so... authentic. It's refreshing after all the fake L.A. vibes.

CHARLIE:
Yeah, authentic like a bad tattoo. Alan, take the kid upstairs?
ALAN:
We need the kitchen light for drying the glue.

JAKE:
Uncle Charlie, does yoga make you fart less? 'Cause Dad says you need it.

CHARLIE:
Jake!
LANA:
(amused) Actually, yoga helps with digestion. Want me to show you a pose, little guy?

JAKE:
Yeah! The fart pose!
Lana demonstrates child's pose. Jake tries, but knocks over the model, beans flying everywhere. One hits Charlie in the eye.

CHARLIE:
Ow! Beanstalker!
Laughter track swells.

[CUT TO:]
EXT. CHARLIE'S BEACH HOUSE - DECK - NIGHT

Charlie and Lana step out for air. Alan cleans up inside with Jake.

LANA:
Your life's chaotic, but it's real. Most guys I date are all poses—no substance.

CHARLIE:
Substance? I've got that. And a piano. Wanna hear a jingle?

LANA:
I'd love to. But include your family next time. Chaos builds character.

CHARLIE:
Character? I've got enough for a sitcom.
They kiss. Inside, Jake watches through the window.

JAKE:
Dad, is that yoga?

ALAN:
No, son. That's regret waiting to happen.

INT. CHARLIE'S BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NEXT MORNING

Alan inspects the rebuilt model—now with beans proudly displayed.

ALAN:
It's... unique. Judith might even like it.

JAKE:
Thanks to the beans! Heritage farts forever!

Charlie enters, disheveled but happy.

CHARLIE:
Date was great. Lana's coming back—for yoga with the kid.

ALAN:
Seriously? You, domesticated?

CHARLIE:
Hey, even bachelors evolve. Or get beaned into it.

Evelyn bursts in unannounced.

EVELYN:
Boys! I heard about the project. Scottish heritage? Please, our family's more vodka than whisky.

JAKE:
Grandma! Wanna see my beanstalk?

EVELYN:
Darling, if it's anything like your father's, it'll be limp and disappointing.

Everyone groans. Laughter track.

The result? A **burnt, bitter taste** and a brew that’s lost most of its natural goodness.

We do things differently. Our Instant Coffee is **freeze-dried**, a much gentler process that locks in **flavour and all the natural goodness**. Here’s how it works:

1nod6t1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1nod6t1/wife_tested_me_i_am_contemplating_leaving_very/,Wife tested me. I am contemplating leaving. Very hard to detach yourself from 10yrs of love,"Throwaway, I can’t face the looks from people who know me. Sorry if this is messy; my hands are still shaking.

I (38M) have been together with my wife (37F) for ten years. We spent most of that time trying for a baby, fertility clinics, hormones, nights in the car crying before going in, the tiniest joys followed by big setbacks. When we finally got a positive test a few months ago I felt like I was breathing again. I tried to be present in a way that mattered. I made her breakfast every morning, rearranged client meetings so I could sit through ultrasounds, read everything I could about pregnancy nutrition, painted the nursery one Saturday and sewed tiny blankets into the late night because I wanted to hold something made by my hands for our child, told my boss I would take leave when needed. These were small, stubborn pledges after years of disappointment.

Little things shifted after that. She started insisting on going to appointments alone, would tell me vague follow ups after the fact, and sometimes slipped contradictory details into her explanations. Ultrasound photos arrived from her phone but felt different, one crisp clinic print, another blurry and cheap, one with a faint watermark. A support band package arrived and the receipt billed to a card I did not recognise. A photo print service charge appeared on a day she had said we were at the clinic. None of it screamed alarm, just a dozen tiny mismatches that grew heavy in my chest. I have at many times almost forced her to take me with her to the clinic cause I was worried about her travelling alone, but each time she made up one or other excuse or convience .

I did not confront her with accusations. I watched, kept notes on my phone, tried to be gentle because the last thing I wanted was to destroy the fragile hope we had found. But the doubt kept growing until I asked her to sit with me one Saturday over coffee. I told her I felt unsettled by inconsistencies and asked, calmly, for honesty. She broke. That quiet, jagged collapse you do not expect. Through sobs she told me she had been terrified, of losing the baby, of me leaving, of the videos and shorts she had binged about men abandoning pregnant partners. She said those clips had burrowed under her skin and convinced her she needed to test me. She admitted some of the scans were edited or printed from stock images, that she had bought a fake bump for days she felt okay but guilty, and that she had staged symptoms to see whether I would step up or walk away.

I sat there listening, my throat full. Part of me immediately wanted to fix it, counsel, medicine, help, do anything. Another part felt hollowed out, all the early mornings, the rescheduled work, the painted nursery, my hand sewing blankets while believing we were building a life together felt like it had been performed for a shadow. She said she had not meant to harm me, only to protect the pregnancy from a future she had seen on a screen. She begged me not to leave.

I do not know what to do. I can see how fear and anxiety twist into desperate acts. Pseudocyesis and trauma can make people behave in ways that hurt the people who love them most. But this was deception that stretched across weeks, not a single panic fueled lie but a sustained staging that made me rearrange my life. Trust, for me, is not a checklist you pass by performing, it is the quiet knowledge that we are telling the truth to one another.

She is gone to her sister’s. She is asking for counseling and psychiatric help; she wants me to come home in a month and see if things feel different. I am reading about mental illness and manipulation because I do not want to be naive, nor cruel. I am thinking of just sending her things back to her mother's house, change the locks and go somewhere else. I have blocked her on everywhere, fb, reddit, wapp, msg, call.

I wrote in this sub a while back about dizziness i was experiencing these last 2 months. I think the first episode triggered was from a coffee and cigarettes i was having in the morning and hasnt stopped ever since. I did some blood work tests and they all are fine, nothing there explains it so i went to the ENT and they suspect of Menieres or inner ear vestibular issues and prescribed me b-complex and betahistine 16 mg twice a day. I went to neurologist as well and she prescribed me cinarizine. I dont know if its good or bad I did this but i havent taken cinarizine because i made some research and I didnt like the side effects. The neurologist said that they didnt think it was sth to do with her. Now take into account that im in a country where public healthcare is not the best, and they dont really care that much. I did an audiogram and apparently my right ear had some problems, i can feel ringing and pressure on it sometimes. Since i ve taken betahistine its been 2 weeks ive been better, only had one bad flare up other days i just have vision problems with focusing, like sometimes i see fine and other times its hard to concentrate and it feels unfocused. Ive only drank one coffee during this time and it made me bad, based on some online reading caffeine intolerance is more linked to VM than MD. I noticed if i laugh too hard it flares up as well, also get dizzy with sudden head movement. For now i only get dizzy in the morning when im on my bed and try to close my eyes again or with sudden movements, and for the rest of the days is this unfocused vision problem some ear pressure as well.

I just want to start by saying I know this is 100% my fault. Pregnancy ruined my teeth. There wasn't much I could do about it but I had the mindset that it was worth it and I could just get them fixed after the baby was born. I used to post alot about this after it happened, I even made yahoo news, but my baby was stillborn. My husband left me at the hospital and when I was discharged I checked into a hotel with an empty carseat and a broken heart. I was told he needed his space to grieve. Not even a week later he grieved all the way into the arms of someone else. I was also told he had every right to leave me because he wanted babies. They are now married with a toddler and another on the way. 

  
My past pain pill addiction was something he used to blame me for not being able to give him a healthy baby. It didn't matter that it was over 10 years before we even met. After that I went into a very dark place and gave up. I stopped caring for myself and that accelerated my teeth issues. There was a part of me who thought if he saw how bad I was doing he would come back. I spent months hospitalized for my mental health. 

  
Every single tooth has chipped enamel or is broken. I can't eat anything now that will put pressure on my teeth. I have to tear everything I eat including bread. Eating is tedious and a chore. Every time I take a bite of something I have to check my mouth to see if any enamel chipped off because the sound and feeling of biting into a loose tooth is horrible. I use my tongue and the roof of my mouth to “chew” the solid food I do try. I keep a big bag of pork rinds next to me for when I don’t “chew” enough and need something to push the food down. 



I made the mistake of eating in front of someone like 2 years ago and she called me out “why are you eating so weird, just chew your food!”. And I've never eaten in front of anyone since.I miss crunchy veggies. I don't ever get hungry which is the weirdest thing, I don’t have cravings anymore. Life is very dull and I know I’m at fault. I don't have dental insurance but managed to get on the list for low income and it took over 2 years but a few weeks ago I had my first appointment. 



I was the first car in the parking lot despite having a 3pm appointment. I was shaking like a leaf and mortified that I was going to have to show someone how much I hated myself. But you know what? The pretty receptionist with the beautiful smile didn't look at me like I was “less than”. The dentist didn’t scold me and even though he wasn’t able to do anything except get me antibiotics for the infection I had, he told me he was proud of me for coming. I left on cloud 9. It was like the fog I was living under had cleared up, I still had hope, and I wasn’t a lost cause. 

  
I miss interacting with people. I can’t remember the last time I made eye contact with someone because I hate seeing your smile fall when I slip up and show mine. I say slip up because I’ve spent hours in the mirror practicing how far I can open my mouth before you see how bad my teeth are. 

  
I'm lucky I have a WFH job but recently I’ve been wanting to get a part time job to ease myself back into the real world because I was literally recluse. An entry level job isn't usually something to be excited about, a coffee shop sounds fun, but nobody wants anything from someone with bad teeth let alone a drink. 

  
My infection cleared up and I was supposed to have my appointment tomorrow but the money I had saved up I had to use to save my cat. Even with carecredit I won’t be able to pay so I’m going to have to cancel. I’ll go back on the list and hope I don’t have to wait years again. I don’t regret saving my cat though, he is the only one who has stuck with me. If you’ve made it this far, go brush your teeth. Floss. Get on a dental school list or a low income dentist list if you need it. Dental care isn’t cosmetic, you deserve a healthy smile too. 

  
TL:DR;  If you’ve never cried because you have to take care of yourself you won’t understand any of this. I cut my matted hair. I started showering like a normal person. I miss living. I’m not ever going to be able to be a mom but I think my life still has value. But everytime I look in the mirror I just see my teeth and realize nothing is going to change until I get them fixed.",4,1758621165.0,TwoXChromosomes,0,0.83,False

It happened to me just yesterday with my best friend Jess. We were at our favorige coffee spot, chatting away about random stuff. By the end of our conversation, I was using her Souuthern drawl, and I'm from the Midwest! 😂

So, why does this happen? It's all abuot a thing called 'mirroring'. It's a subtle social trick our brains do without us noticing, to bond with the person we're talking to. Basically, when we unconsciously mimic someone's words, tone, or gestures, it can make us seem more familiar and likable to them. It kinda stems from our natural humwn desire to conneft and fit in. Plus, when we're really engaged in what someone else is saying, we tend to mirror them more.

1nod3bi,https://i.redd.it/740p9rz2zvqf1.jpeg,[DISCUSSION] How to Select a Profitable Niche in 2025 — The Strategy No One Talks About,"So, I was deep-diving the internet 
(as one does when avoiding ""real"" work) 
and stumbled on a killer thread: 
“How to Select a Profitable Niche in 2025 The Strategy No One Talks About.” 
Most niche guides are the same boring soup, but this one actually made me pause my fourth cup of coffee.Here’s the real-talk cheat sheet you need if you hate being late to trends:

1. Marry Passion With Data (Don’t Just Wing It!)
Yeah yeah, “follow your passion”… but not if the niche is dead. 
Here’s my trick: list the stuff you’re obsessed with, then pop those ideas into Google Trends or keyword tools to make sure random strangers care too. 
If people are buying AND ranting/raving about it online, you’re in business (literally)

2. Go Super-Niche or Go Home
2025 is savage. If you just make a “weight loss” website, you’ll be lost in the digital ocean. Here’s what’s working: 
drill down until you’re almost uncomfortable  think “meal plans for vegan gamers” or “side hustles for single dads.” The more specific, the more likely you’ll get passionate superfans (and not just your mom reading your blog)

3. Spy Before You Buy (Into a Niche)
Before going all-in, do a bit of online detective work. Look at SERPs, Amazon reviews, forums where people complaining, wishing, or forking out cash? And seriously, check that it’s not overrun with mega-brands. If you see ads EVERYWHERE for a micro-topic, that’s a “cha-ching” moment: real companies burning ad cash = real opportunity for us regular folks
.Secret Sauce (‘Cause You’re Special!):
This is wild but it works 
[use SEMRush] 
(or any ad spy tool) to stalk what keywords those big spenders are pushing. They’re basically doing our homework for us! Follow the money, not just the hype.

Alright, now spill:
What’s the weirdest niche you’ve made money from?

1. **Remove the tiles** – I just don’t know how to do this easily, especially since they seem quite stuck on. What would be the best way to get them off without too many tools?
2. **Keep the mosaic** – maybe add grout/filling like in typical mosaic artwork to make it smoother and safer? But then I’d still need to deal with the uneven/sharp edges around the outside.

My constraints:

* I live in an apartment (so everything needs to be doable indoors).
* It’s winter, so no outdoor messy work.
* I don’t own many tools and don’t have prior DIY experience.
* Ideally I’d like a cheap but nice way to make this table usable again.

Stay at Jakes.
Will go to Pelican Bar for my birthday, and just lounge at the beach.

* 2 nights in Blue Mountain
Looking at The Nest for accomodation.
Long drive, so probably stop at Hellshire for lunch.
Enjoy coffee, do some hikes, splash in the waterfalls, BBQ some food and stare at the stars. 

* 1 night in Kingston
No hotel booked yet.
Bob Marley, Art Murals, Devon House

* 4 nights in Negril
Stay at Ocean Cliff Hotel
Seven Mile Beach, Appleton Distillery on the way (break up the drive), maybe a boat tour.
Fly home from Montego Bay.

Anyone got any suggestions, critique? I had fancied going to Boston Bay for jerk but feel it's a bit far. Obviously skipping the north coast but don't think it's got much for us.

1nocvqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mosaic/comments/1nocvqe/help_beginner_diyer_how_to_restoreupgrade_this/,[Help] Beginner DIYer – How to restore/upgrade this mosaic coffee table I found?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a total beginner at DIY and picked up this coffee table on the side of the road because I really loved the mosaic top and colors. The problem is, it feels a bit poorly done. There’s no cement/grout/filler between the tiles (sorry if my vocabulary is off – very new to this!) and many of the tiles stick out past the edges, leaving sharp bits all around the rim. That makes it not very practical as a coffee table right now.

I see two possible directions, but I’m not sure which is realistic for me:

1. **Remove the tiles** – I just don’t know how to do this easily, especially since they seem quite stuck on. What would be the best way to get them off without too many tools?
2. **Keep the mosaic** – maybe add grout/filling like in typical mosaic artwork to make it smoother and safer? But then I’d still need to deal with the uneven/sharp edges around the outside.

My constraints:

* I live in an apartment (so everything needs to be doable indoors).
* It’s winter, so no outdoor messy work.
* I don’t own many tools and don’t have prior DIY experience.
* Ideally I’d like a cheap but nice way to make this table usable again.

It just seemed like a shame to leave it on the street, but I’m not sure what the smartest approach is. Any advice for a total beginner on what to do (and what NOT to do) would be really appreciated!

1nocuzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nocuzl/after_7_years_i_quit_by_handing_my_resignation/,"After 7 years, I quit by handing my resignation mid-ambush. My boss and her cronies cried over samosas.","TL;DR: After 7 years at a company, a new manager, created a toxic hellscape where she'd cry if you didn't greet her, hold useless meetings during critical deadlines, and bully people into quitting. When she tried to ambush me with a disciplinary hearing, I reversed it by handing her my resignation on the spot.

Hey everyone, long-time lurker, first-time poster. I need to vent about my previous workplace. This all went down about 2/3 years ago, but I still think about how insane it was.

I (27F at the time) had worked for this IT/Food growing company for 8 years, moving up from sales to a role in creditors. Then, a restructuring brought in Camila (not her real name), who reported to the Director of Finance. She hired two managers, Sally and Cally, and together they formed the Toxic Trio.

M first red flag? Camila had these intense, crazy eyes (like from How I Met Your Mother). She proved me right by systematically targeting people to make their lives so unbearable they'd quit. Here are just a few highlights of the chaos.

The Daily Greeting Ritual

We worked in a huge open-plan office. Most of us would get in, grab coffee, say a quick ""good morning,"" put in our headphones, and get to work. Camila, however, was always late but expected a royal greeting. If you didn't stop what you were doing the second she arrived to acknowledge her, you'd get pulled into a ""meeting"" about respect.

Chaos 1: The Samosa Incident

One lunch break, I bought a bunch of samosas on special and gave a few to random coworkers near me—just a nice gesture. Camila and Cally called me into a meeting room for a verbal warning. They said I was ""excluding"" them and that their feelings were ""hurt."" They started crying. I was just sitting there, stunned, thinking, ""Are two grown women actually crying over fried dough and potatoes?""

Chaos 2: The Grilled Cheese Betrayal

I used to make secret grilled cheese sandwiches for our finance group. (Camila knew and even asked for some.) But after another one of her episodes, I'd had enough. I took all my snacks and kitchen utensils home, leaving only my stationery. Ten minutes after I left for the day, she was running around the office telling people I wasn't coming back. I know this because I was locked out of my laptop the next morning until IT fixed it.

Chaos 3: The ""Disrespectful"" Ambush

Camila came in one day clearly upset about something. I made the mistake of asking if I could help. She lost her shit on me, calling me ""disrespectful"" in front of the entire office. I calmly replied, ""You should treat others with the respect you want to be treated with first."" She immediately stormed off to HR.

Speaking of HR, Camila became best friends with them, along with other department managers. Any complaint against her was blocked, and anyone who tried would be bullied by Camila, Sally, and Cally until they quit.

Their favorite trick? Scheduling pointless, hours-long meetings during month-end, when every second counts. If we missed deadlines because of these meetings, we would get written up. They'd stack these write-ups and within two months have enough to call a disciplinary hearing to fire someone.

I was so overworked and stressed that if I made one tiny mistake (like forgetting to process one single invoice), it would trigger multiple ""improvement"" meetings. Meanwhile, people kept quitting, and I was expected to handle my workload plus everyone else's without any compensation.

The Final Straw

One night, I got a WhatsApp message: ""There is a meeting tomorrow very early. You should be there.""

I knew it was an ambush. They were building a case to fire me. I immediately started looking for new jobs and typed up my resignation letter.

I walked into that meeting. They slid a piece of paper across the table: a notice for a disciplinary hearing in two days.

I UNO-reversed that shit so fast.

I smiled, slid my resignation letter right back at them, and said, ""I quit. Effective immediately."" I took the disciplinary hearing notice with me.

I was crying tears of relief and anger as I walked out. Everyone could see something had happened, and I didn't hold back. I showed my close colleagues the disciplinary paper and said, ""I'm quitting because of them.""

Within 30 minutes, I was escorted from the building. They paid my 30-day notice period, but I was banned from returning. They literally watched me get into my Uber and drive away before they went back inside.

There's so much more crazy stuff, but I am so, so glad I left. I'm in a much better place now. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest.",3,1758620081.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I 20(M) was in a relationship with this beautiful girl. We were together almost 2 years. We met at summer camp. What drew me in wasn’t only her looks but her whole vibe — this soft, joyful energy. She was joyful,sweet, playful, present. She’d wear my hoodies, pick up my phrases, we did pinky promises, we watched the stars, we had this silly “yellow car = little slap” game, and late-night calls with stupid laughter that felt like home. She could be a bit jealous (in a real human way), but she always supported me — even during my big exams and my music . We also had normal couple stuff: dates, nature trips, I once bought her a phone, inside jokes. It wasn’t “all bad” at all.
At the very beginning (before we were solid), I messed up with another girl who was close to her. She found out a year in. That cracked trust. She stayed and tried, I got defensive.
I started confusing her bids for connection with “accusations.” She’d say “I just want you present,” I heard “you’re blaming me.”
I went hot-and-cold: some days affectionate, other days distant/quiet/cold. I raised my voice sometimes, argued over small things, stopped the small acts and said things I really regret. 
Routine hit and I didn’t fight it. Ego > presence.
told myself breaking up would “prevent us from ending up hating each other” although I wasn’t sure about my decision back then. Truth: I was scared, selfish, and blind to what mattered.
The breakup was gradual distance. Not a master plan it was more like death by a thousand missed moments. Then I ended it although she said she wanted to fight for us .At first I felt relieved, like a weight was gone. Weeks later it slammed me. I kept stalking, replaying memories, and when I left my city for  summer work it all crashed: paranoia, guilt, the “what did I do?” loop. I tried talking to her ( i begged ) but she said she was happy with herself and that it was better for both of us to keep it that way she wished me the best 
I know I’m not the victim
Now (3 months later):
My days are a loop: coffee, cigarettes, phone scrolling, sleep. I try to see friends but feel like a ghost. I wake up thinking of her and go to sleep the same. I went to uni counseling once; it didn’t click (I’ll try again). My mom struggles with psychosis, so home can be rough , father is dead and there are no other family members . Money’s tight. I know I’ve talked about her too much to friends. I’m scared I’m turning pain into an identity.
The thought that kills me is that “I’ll never find any girl like her” : I did nothing when it mattered and lost an exceptional girl who only wanted presence.I feel so alone man my friends got distant and she really felt like the home I never had 
I’m not trying to win her back or break her boundaries again. She asked for distance and I respect that.

feeling drained halfway through the day is something many of us experience, and it’s not always about lack of sleep. there are simple, natural ways to boost your energy and stay productive without relying on coffee or energy drinks. here are a few tips:  


1. **stay hydrated** – dehydration is a major cause of fatigue. drinking water regularly, especially in the morning, helps your body function better and keeps your energy up.
2. **eat balanced meals** – focus on foods that provide slow-release energy, like oats, nuts, eggs, fruits, and vegetables. avoid excessive sugar, which can give a quick boost but leads to crashes.
3. **move your body** – even short walks or stretching during the day can increase blood flow and oxygen to your muscles and brain, instantly improving alertness.
4. **prioritize sleep** – aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep. good sleep restores your body’s energy and improves focus.
5. **manage stress** – prolonged stress can drain energy. simple practices like meditation, deep breathing, or journaling can help reduce mental fatigue.
6. **sunlight exposure** – morning sunlight helps regulate your body clock and boosts mood and energy naturally.

these habits don’t just make you feel awake; they improve overall health and productivity in the long run. small changes consistently can lead to noticeable improvements in energy levels.

**tip for readers:** try integrating one habit at a time and observe how your energy changes. small steps often work better than a complete overhaul.",1,1758619781.0,u_PerspectiveFit6976,0,1.0,False

Procrastination isn’t laziness. It’s a cycle. One that offers short-term relief but creates long-term stress, guilt, and lost opportunities.

**Here’s how to break it:**

🔹 **Start small** – Big tasks overwhelm. Begin with the tiniest step: open the document, lace up your shoes, make that one call.

🔹 **Redefine progress** – Waiting for perfect is the enemy of progress. A draft or imperfect first step is always better than nothing.

🔹 **Leverage accountability** – Share your goal with someone who can check in, encourage, and remind you of what you set out to do.

Once you interrupt the cycle, you can replace it with habits that stick:

✨ Build habits around identity (“I am someone who values growth”).  
✨ Stack new habits onto old ones (journal after morning coffee).  
✨ Celebrate small wins — they fuel motivation and confidence.

The truth is, you don’t have to “feel ready” before you act. Action itself creates motivation.

Sit and have a coffee while they go over pricing and options, even though you know exactly what you want. Unnecessary and costly markups. Weasley double-speak so salesman can have plausible deniability. The lazy, misogyny stereotype by older coworkers whenever a woman goes in to buy a car or get service done to get a few extra dollars.

Anecdotally, I heard a salesman inked an authorization to run a persons credit with a customer when they backed out last minute. Turns out the other dealership in town gave them a more favorable rate. The salesman ran their credit anyway when the customer left out of spite. It’s dog eat dog sales, designed to break and shame the client. Many people end up purchasing a car they don’t need or can’t afford, because the salesman ultimately gets an extra $200+ in their paycheck.

Having worked service side at a dealership before, those institutions prey on people in need of a car immediately. Thankfully, I’m no longer in a strained position like I was nearly a decade ago, nor do I need another car for the time being. God forbid insurance totals my car again because of hail, or I get in a wreck, but when my current car hits 150k miles in a few years, I’ll email a broker and start looking for another car. 

I can’t help but think “what if” the USA wasn’t so car dependent. Maybe we wouldn’t have such a stressful institution that is current car dealerships.

Walking into a luxury kitchen showroom for the first time can feel like stepping into a modern design magazine. With sleek cabinetry, innovative appliances, and breathtaking layouts, these spaces showcase the pinnacle of culinary aesthetics and efficiency. In Scottsdale—a city known for its refined taste and stylish living—visiting a high-end kitchen showroom is not just about picking finishes; it’s about experiencing possibilities.

Whether you’re remodeling your home or building a new one, understanding what to expect during your visit can help you get the most out of your experience. From the moment you arrive, each detail is designed to engage your senses and guide you toward a more personalized vision for your kitchen.

## The Purpose of a Kitchen Showroom Visit

At its core, a kitchen showroom is a curated environment where design meets inspiration. You’ll find fully functional kitchen models that blend cutting-edge appliances, luxurious materials, and ergonomic layouts. These showrooms exist not only to display products but to help you visualize your future kitchen.

Seeing these spaces in person allows you to evaluate the texture of materials, test the comfort of drawer pulls, and imagine how a layout fits your lifestyle. It’s a far cry from browsing online catalogs—this is about immersion. It’s an opportunity to connect ideas with real-world possibilities.

## First Impressions: A Feast for the Eyes

Upon entering a high-end kitchen showroom in Scottsdale, your senses are immediately engaged. Warm lighting illuminates stunning countertops made of marble, quartz, and high-grade wood. Cabinets in matte finishes or high-gloss veneers open smoothly to reveal custom organizers.

Faucets glisten under spotlights, and every design choice speaks to an elevated sense of sophistication. The ambiance is both welcoming and aspirational—crafted to ignite your imagination and introduce you to a world where form meets function.

## Personalized Consultations and Expert Guidance

One of the most valuable aspects of a luxury showroom visit is access to experienced kitchen designers. These professionals are not just salespeople—they are consultants trained in interior design, space planning, and current trends. During your visit to a [kitchen showroom in Scottsdale](https://www.leichtscottsdale.com/), you’ll likely be paired with a designer who will ask about your cooking habits, storage needs, and aesthetic preferences.

Their goal is to help you create a personalized vision and turn your ideas into a tangible plan. They’ll walk you through material selections, suggest layout tweaks, and provide insight into what will truly elevate your kitchen to a luxury experience.

## Interactive Features That Enhance the Experience

High-end showrooms don’t just look impressive—they’re designed to be interactive. Many include smart kitchen technology demonstrations, allowing you to test features like voice-activated lighting, touch-sensitive faucets, or app-controlled ovens.

Sample drawers and cabinet systems are placed at different heights to help you assess ergonomic design. These interactive elements go beyond the visual; they let you experience how the kitchen will feel and function in your daily life. The ability to physically engage with components often sparks ideas that static images can’t.

## A Glimpse Into Luxury: Completed Project Displays

Another hallmark of a high-end kitchen showroom is the display of completed projects. These exhibits show how showroom concepts come to life in real homes. For example, the [luxury kitchen showroom](https://www.leichtscottsdale.com/projects) at LEICHT Scottsdale features portfolio pieces that demonstrate how designs are adapted to diverse architectural styles—from modern condos to classic desert estates.

These real-world examples help you understand scale, customization, and how design choices interact with lighting, space, and decor. They give context to your dreams and help visualize how your own space could evolve.

## Design Elements to Watch For

While browsing the showroom, you’ll begin to notice the thoughtful details that define high-end design. Hidden storage solutions, soft-close drawers, seamless cabinet fronts, and under-cabinet lighting all serve both form and function.

You may also encounter innovative layout styles such as double islands or chef’s stations with built-in sous-vide equipment. Keep an eye on material combinations—how wood pairs with metal, or how stone is accented with glass. These stylistic cues can inspire your own unique combinations at home.

## How to Prepare Before Your Visit

Maximizing your visit begins with a bit of preparation. Bring floor plans or dimensions of your existing kitchen, along with photos or a Pinterest board of styles you love. Knowing your budget range and timeline will also help the designer tailor suggestions that are realistic.

Consider making a list of features you want—like a coffee station, walk-in pantry, or wine fridge—so you don’t forget anything in the moment. Being well-prepared allows for a more efficient and personalized consultation that’s focused on your specific needs.

## Questions to Ask During Your Visit

Don’t be afraid to ask questions—it’s the best way to ensure your design is both beautiful and practical. Ask about lead times, installation services, and the durability of different materials. Inquire about customization options: Can cabinet heights be adjusted? Are finishes UV-resistant? What warranties are offered?

The more information you gather, the more confident you’ll feel when making final decisions. It also helps to ask about return visits, revisions to renderings, or opportunities to view materials in different lighting conditions.

## The Design Process After the Visit

Your journey doesn’t end when you leave the showroom. After your visit, the designer typically follows up with digital renderings, layout suggestions, and pricing estimates based on your preferences.

This collaborative phase allows you to refine your vision with professional input. Samples may be sent home for further review, and meetings can be scheduled to adjust plans as needed. It’s a process that blends creativity with precision, tailored to your home’s unique needs and lifestyle.

## Benefits of Choosing a High-End Showroom Experience

The benefits of visiting a luxury showroom extend far beyond aesthetics. You’re investing in quality craftsmanship, superior materials, and expert guidance. The result is a kitchen that’s not only beautiful but also enhances your daily life through intuitive design.

It’s a space where culinary creativity, family gatherings, and personal style harmonize. In short, it’s more than just a kitchen—it’s a central feature of your home’s character and functionality.

## Conclusion

Visiting a high-end kitchen showroom in Scottsdale is more than just a step in the renovation process—it’s an experience that elevates your vision. Surrounded by the best in design and technology, guided by knowledgeable professionals, you’ll walk away inspired, informed, and excited to begin creating the kitchen of your dreams.

Whether you’re renovating a historic home or building a sleek new space, the insights gained from your showroom visit will prove invaluable. You’ll find that this experience changes the way you think about space, style, and how you live. A luxury kitchen begins with a dream—and that dream starts taking shape the moment you step into a thoughtfully curated showroom. By knowing what to expect, preparing ahead of time, and engaging fully with the experience, you ensure that your next kitchen isn’t just functional, but extraordinary.",1,1758618931.0,GermanKitchenCabinet,0,1.0,False

We texted a lot for about a week before we went on a date, we had a lot in common and I really enjoyed talking to him. We got coffee together and then went back to his apartment to watch a movie. The movie was good, we laughed a lot and cuddled during the movie. Afterwards we talked a lot about life and it got kinda deep, then we started kissing, one thing led to another, and I spent the night at his place.
The date went great, we both really enjoyed it even though everything moved kind of fast. We talked about what we were looking for and neither of us were really sure, but we just knew that we didn't want it to be a meaningless hookup (the date definitely did not feel like a meaningless hookup either). I got worried because he wasnt texting a lot after that, and eventually he told me last week that even though he really likes me, with schoolwork ramping up he doesnt want to commit to a relationship with me that he wont have time to upkeep. He's graduating this year and he realized that he really wants to focus on his degree and his career, and that he might move to a different state after college to be closer to his family (both of us said that long distance was off the table) I totally respect his honesty about that, but I'd be lying if I said I wasnt in shambles about it.
I let myself get hopeful and excited about a future relationship with him and it didn't end up panning out. I feel silly being so upset about this, but I'm a very emotional person so this feels like a big deal to me. Does anyone have any advice for how I can move on? Please be kind :)

TLDR; hung out with a guy and it was great, later he very politely ended things with me, and I'm so upset about it which feels very silly. How do I get over it?",1,1758618686.0,relationship_advice,5,0.67,False

Day 1: we drove to Berlin, has some good kebab (we love), spent the night there at this amazing hotel. (pic 1,2,3)

Day 2 (the craziest): we had to save the time so we drove 16 hours straight to Milan. Took a few gas stops, had coffee in Munich… but around 9:30 pm when we were supposed to reach Switzerland, both our phones turned off the maps. Our ETA was around midnight. (pic 4,5,6)

It was dark, we lost service, we had to somehow get through the mountains safely. We started looking for an emergency stay at some hotel but it was quite late. We didn’t panic tho. The maps went on again. New ETA 3am. Through Austria. I just knew Google maps messed something up so I went to my saved routes. Unfortunately, I lost service again so we followed the new route (it was all we had). We were feeling fine so we decided to just head to our Aribnb in Milan.

What we had to drive through, I still have nightmares about dying there. I drove for 2,5 hours in complete darkness, surrounded by majestic mountains which we only could see the contours of. There was a snowstorm. At some point I saw a ‘2000 metres above the sea level’ sign. Hairpin turns, snowstorm and my summer tyres. I was literally praying the whole time that we do not get lost. Thank God my tank was full.

So, after driving basically on a mountain for 3 hours, we made it out. I saw some houses, city lights and I was the happiest person on earth.

For another 15 minutes I was looking for a parking spot!! Finally we found it and went to sleep.

Day3: Woke up around 10 ish. It was Lake Como and friends reunion day. It was beautiful, my boyfriend rented a self drive boat, bought us some gelato and we just enjoyed the weather and the views there.

We went Milan in the afternoon. Met my boyfriend’s friend in town, Duomo, Arancini, olives and gluten free cheesy pizza were delicious. We had some cocktails, just wandered around town, went to another restaurant and tried some Saffron Risotto and a Margarita. Lovely day, perfect after what we went through at night (pic 7,8,9,10,11,12)

Day 4: Seceda Day. We went to another Airbnb in the Dolomites and planned a hike on Seceda. It was mildly cold, when we were going up there it started raining and by the time we had 20 minutes left to the peak, we saw a snowstorm alert. No wonder all people we passed on the way were going back down hahaha But! We were still satisfied with amazing views, then drenched and extremely tired we ordered some kebab on the way, got pulled over by Carabinieri (just a routine control) 😭 we went to our airbnb and enjoyed the views, our favourite show and wonderful Mountain View from our balcony. (pic 13,14,15)

Day 5: Coming back day. We woke up early, packed our bags and headed back to Poland. Refilled the oil, took a stop in Innsbruck, had some amazing lamb chops with saffron rice (best rice I’ve ever had). And we continued. Every 3/4 hours I had to take a gas stop. We reached home around 4 am. (pic 16,17,17)

Summing up: I’m the best driver ever, we had the greatest time of our lives, on the way we sang, watched movies, listened to our favourite soundtracks. It was the loveliest time!

• Someone who’s single with no excess baggage from the past please lol

- Microplastics have been found in human blood, brain and testicles; health effects remain uncertain, especially for smaller particles below detection limits.
- Switching to glass or stainless‑steel containers and avoiding high‑temperature contact with plastic can reduce exposure.

Why it matters: The findings suggest everyday hot drinks may be a significant source of microplastic ingestion, highlighting the need for better packaging standards.

Long story short, I had this personal decision to make about whether to switch jobs. It's been so nerve-wracking, and I was feeling kinda overwelmed. But I took some deep breaths, grabed a coffee from my favorite cafe, and just sat with my thoughts for a bit.

Turns out, trusting my own judgment didn't implode my wrold. I realized I had been underestimating my instincts, and guess what? I feel so much more at peace with the decision I've made. It's not some massive achievement, but it feels huge to me.

1. **Find your natural session length:** Everyone has a sweet spot. For some it’s 20 minutes, for me it’s about 2 hours. I set a timer for that length, with one single 5–10 minute break anywhere inside.
2. **Always set subgoals:** No blind studying. I usually like just keeping it straightforward: ""Read 1 chapter, understand this concept, do 3 practice problems"" Nothing more, nothing less.
3. **If you use a timer, be strict about it:** I used to “just go and grab water” and don’t pause, but then the timer lies.

a month ago, I left the 9–5. Instead of “finding myself” in Bali (done that before, ahah), I locked myself in with too much coffee and built my first startup in a week. Launched it here on Reddit → it picked up 500+ users and even hit $200 MRR

so now… startup number two 🙏🏻 built landing with Lovable and curious about your thoughts - [Avelon.so](http://Avelon.so)

building an AI tool that finds hundreds of the right leads, enriches them with context, and drafts outreach emails that actually get replies instead of ignores

I built it to solve my own headache: finding high-quality leads that aren’t just scraped emails

how it works:  
– you describe the people you want to reach (e.g. “B2B SaaS heads of growth in NYC”).  
– [Avelon.so](http://Avelon.so) searches across the web and builds a list with depth.  
– each lead includes context that you want: what they do, what they’ve shared, what they care about.  
– you get custom email draft for each lead so outreach at scale doesn’t feel cold anymore, it feels like you actually did your homework.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Rangers vs. Twins Prediction: A Tale of Two Teams, One Disastrous Run Line**

The Texas Rangers (-136) and Minnesota Twins (+116) collide in a September showdown that’s less “World Series preview” and more “two tired boxers swapping left hooks in the 12th round.” Let’s break this down with the statistical rigor of a spreadsheet and the humor of a Twitter thread after a bad coffee.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why This Feels Like a Coin Flip Wearing a Suit

The Rangers enter as slight favorites, but their implied probability of winning (58.1%) feels like betting on a limping gazelle to outrun a sloth in a heatwave. They’ve won 62.8% of games when favored this season, which is solid, but their pitching staff looks like a Jenga tower after a toddler’s birthday party. Starter Patrick Corbin (4.33 ERA, 7-10 record) is the human equivalent of a “meh” emoji—competent but forgettable. The Twins’ starter, Zebby Matthews (5.97 ERA), is worse, like a baker who forgets to add flour to a cake and calls it “gluten-free avant-garde.”

Both teams average 4.2 runs per game, but the Rangers’ 3.46 ERA vs. the Twins’ 4.68 ERA gives Texas a clear edge in keeping the other team’s offense from morphing into a espresso-fueled squirrel. Yet, Minnesota’s 184 home runs (vs. Texas’ 170) mean Byron Buxton could single-handedly end the game with a moonshot, assuming he doesn’t trip over first base again.

---

### Injury Report: A Cast of Thousands (Minus the Stars)

The Rangers’ injury list reads like a who’s-who of “players we paid $30 million to never see again”: Corey Seager (out), Marcus Semien (out), Jon Gray (out). It’s a lineup so decimated, they’re basically playing “Tetris” with their bench—keeping the pieces stacked without a clue what the final picture should look like.

The Twins aren’t exactly hosting a medical convention, either. Th

1noc2m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1noc2m7/navigating_ex_joining_family_gym/,Navigating ex joining family gym,"I need some advice on a situation. I 26F dated a guy 27M for 4-5 years.

Some background (sorry it’s going to be a bit of an essay) - The relationship was great and he treated me extremely well for the most part. We went through a lot together, met in high school, reconnected in university and the relationship sustained even through me moving overseas for exchange for 6 months. We raised a dog together.

The only thing was, he was in the field of medicine. Which made things quite hard for us. He moved about 2 hrs away and had crazy hours. Although we tried to make time for each other, it was often difficult because when he did have downtime he was exhausted from work and would end up resting/sleeping for the most part. I had communicated multiple times that this was putting strain on me because I felt that even though I was in a relationship, I was alone.

In the last year of our relationship, he had to apply to be placed somewhere for the following year (community service year). He mentioned the application a few times casually. It was never a serious sit down conversation between us, but long story short he ended up applying for a placement at the further est possible location. He didn’t even apply for work in our home town/city and said it was a career based decision because there are no good work opportunities in our home town/city. But said that after the community service year he would come back to our home town/city for me. Which made no sense to me at the time because of his reasoning.

When work died down for me and reality sunk in when he was placed, I came to the realization that this hadn’t really been the serious conversation it needed to be. I was upset and hurt because I felt like I wasn’t really considered in the decision. He assumed I would be completely fine with long distance, even though the “medium distance” situation at the time was taking its toll. So in the end, I ended things with him - not only due to the distance but the lack of communication and consideration for our relationship.

When we ended things in December last year, it was amicable - I even gave him his Christmas gift early. I thanked him for all he did for me and for the way he treated me. But as the months went on I felt an anger at the complacency he demonstrated in the last few months of the relationship.

I didn’t hear from him for the most part. I started dating someone in June this year for about 2 months but it didn’t work out.

When I was dating this new person though, I heard my ex had joined my gym in my home town. Which was odd because he was not living there - he was across the country. Just fyi- this boxing gym is sponsored by my dad’s company, my family is there (sister, dad, aunt) and so are my friends. It’s right opposite my dad’s company offices. And there is a long standing association between my family and this gym. My ex never really went there unless it was a couple times together when we were dating. He actually preferred a different boxing gym. He struck up a conversation with my sister and mentioned he is taking leave from work 1 week of each month and spending it in our home town from now on.

When I found this out I was upset, and a bit angry. He reinserted himself months after the breakup into a place I felt was my safe space. I freaked out and stopped going to the gym for fear I’d run into him.

Flash forward to this week. I have started going back to the boxing gym. I love the sense of community - my family and friends. I bump into him. He is wearing my dad’s company (heavily branded) tshirt. We greet each other but I’m freaking out inside. At the end of the session, I approach him, am really friendly and make some small talk. I ask him if he is free after the session to grab a coffee. He winces and pauses and says he doesn’t know that’s a good idea out of respect for the person he is seeing. I quickly reassure him that’s not my intention and that I just want to clear the air since we are both going to the same gym. He agrees to go for a coffee opposite the gym. I’m waiting at the cafe for him to finish his session. I see him coming out and calling someone - I presume his new girl to ask her permission to talk to me ? We chat for a bit, small talk about family, career etc and just catching up. It was friendly. I ask him why he’s at the gym. He says he thinks it’s fine cause I’m not really there and also we “ended on really good terms”. Ps, I’m all over the gyms Instagram. But he says if it’s an issue he can go elsewhere. In the moment I say it’s fine and a place for everyone to train. We shows me my dog is still his screensaver…

I couldn’t help but feel sad. So I wanted to leave. I called it quickly and said I had to get going. We hugged and said bye.

Now all I feel is anger and sadness. He has this concern for his new gf but no concern or respect for me/ my space/ my family? I couldn’t be more confused on how to feel.

I also have this feeling his new girlfriend lives in our home town.

This happened a few days ago. It’s his birthday today. I don’t know how to go about this situation in general - do I ask him to train elsewhere? Do I continue as normal even though it hurts to see him? I don’t want him to think I’m bothered or jealous of his new gf. Truth is I don’t know how I’m feeling.

A couple of things I’ve tried:  
  
Soft lo-fi playlists while I tidy up (makes chores feel way less like “work”)  
  
Jazz or acoustic in the evenings with the lights dimmed — it instantly slows everything down  
  
Ambient “rain + piano” tracks on a Sunday morning while brewing coffee  
  
I usually just throw it on through my Lava, and it’s surprising how much of a difference it makes in the feel of the space.

Like, there I was, meeting this woman at a yoga class. We ended up chatting afetr class, and she seemed really nice, but I couldn’t shaie the feling that I was on some kind of platonic first date 🤷‍♀️. 

It’s funny because back in the day, making friends was just so easy, y’know? You sat next to spmeone in school, shared crayons, and boom – you were besties. Now, it's like you have to consciously decide to put yourself out there, and idk, that’s kiinda vullnerable. I found msyelf overthinking what to say or whether she'd think I'm weird for asking her to grab coffee sometjme.

But what I realized was that stating to reach out, even with all the awkwardness and vulnerability, kinda showed me a pattern: I’ve beocme way too comfortable with the friends I've had for years, and maybe it's been holding me back from meeting cool new people. It’s not easy breaking out of that comfort zone, but I'm trying to remind myself that being a lil' awkward is a part of the process, and hey, maybe she’s feeling the same way.

Anyone else feel this kinda pressure or have tips on maknig new adult friendships feel less like an awkward dance? 😊",10,1758616730.0,ComfortZoneChronicles,0,1.0,False

I've been taking Vyanse (Elvanse) for some years now. Recently (like since 6¡ months) I always have stomache issues in the morning when taking my meds. It's similar to what some people have with coffee (need to use the toilet immediately). 

My stomach health was always really good & I don't know what changed. It's worse when taking a higher dosage and generally isn't great throughout the day. I don't have issues when I forget to take them and eating something before taking them helps a bit. 

Does anyone have similar problems? Does anyone have experience with medication to protect your stomach?

1nobxcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1nobxcw/help_wanted_im_on_pto_and_not_going_back/,Help Wanted! I'm on PTO and not going back...,"It's been a hell of a week. Look I don't even know where to start or even what to say....it still feels...I mean...DAMN. Alright, alright let's just start from the beginning of my week.

Tuesday Night

The drive from my apartment to the store is usually just a blur of brake lights and radio static. But tonight, the streetlights seemed to hum with a low, menacing energy, and the city's concrete felt… heavier. I pulled into the vast, empty parking lot and sat for a moment, the car engine ticking as it cooled. The massive building stood before me, a familiar beacon of commerce, but tonight, it looked like a tomb under the harsh yellow glow of the security lights.

At 11 PM, I make my way inside the front door and stepped into the familiar, manufactured cold of the store. The air was sterile, almost clinical, but there was a subtle, unfamiliar undertone to it. A hint of something damp and metallic. I tried to shake it off as the usual ""closed store"" smell.

My team trickled in, and the atmosphere was its usual mix of tired grunts and quiet chatter. Jamal, a mountain of a man who worked produce, was already stretching his back out. Maria, a woman with a wry smile and a sharp tongue, was zipping her winter jacket all the way up, even though the store was warm. Liam, the youngest of the crew, looked like he'd just rolled out of bed, his eyes half-closed.

""Alright, people, listen up!"" I said, my voice echoing in the vast, silent space. ""We've got a heavy truck tonight, all hands on deck for dry goods. Frank's already back there, so let's hit it hard. We want to be wrapped up by 6am, so the morning crew can get in here and do their thing.""

A chorus of tired affirmatives followed, and the team dispersed. The sounds of pallet jacks, the clatter of carts, and the low murmur of conversation filled the store. It felt like normal. But I was wrong.

The first oddity was small. Insignificant. Around 1:30 AM, I was in the dairy cooler with Sarah, a quiet, meticulous stocker. We were checking dates on the milk when she shivered. ""Something wrong?"" I asked.

""Nah, just… I feel like I'm not alone in here,"" she said, her voice a low whisper.

I chuckled. ""Only me and about a hundred gallons of whole milk, Sarah. You're fine.""

Just as I said it, a glass milk bottle on the top shelf rattled violently, then slid forward, crashing onto the concrete floor. Sarah shrieked, jumping back. I stared at the puddle of milk, my heart pounding against my ribs. There was no vibration, no logical reason for it to have moved. ""Just a faulty stack,"" I said, but the words felt hollow in the cold, oppressive silence of the cooler.

Later, I was walking down a back aisle when I heard Brenda let out a frustrated grunt. ""Ugh, a doll blinked at me. I'm telling you, this job is going to drive me nuts,"" she mumbled to herself, not even looking up. I walked over, and her face was pale. She was holding a children's toy, its plastic eyes fixed and lifeless. She swore it had blinked. I picked it up. Its painted eyes were unblinking. It was just a toy. But the look in her eyes told me she was telling the truth.

The atmosphere in the store shifted from tired and productive to tense and on edge. The low chatter died down. People started working in pairs. At 3:00 AM, the lights in the main aisle began to flicker with a subtle, sickening rhythm. Chloe, an artist by day, was in the health and beauty section, and I saw them staring at the flickering lights, their face pale.

""It feels like a heartbeat, Ant,"" they said, their voice low and full of dread. ""Like the store is… alive.""

A cold dread began to set in. This wasn't just my imagination. Something was wrong.

At 4:00 AM, I was in the back receiving area when I heard a gut-wrenching, metallic crash. I called out for Frank on the walkie-talkie. Nothing but static. I ran back there, my heart pounding. Boxes were strewn everywhere, a pallet jack was on its side, and Frank was cowering in a corner, his face an ashen mask of pure terror.

""It just… it just threw it!"" he stammered, pointing a trembling finger at the pallet jack. ""That whole pallet… it just lifted off the ground and threw itself against the wall!""

I stared at the twisted metal of the pallet jack, then at a dislodged ceiling tile. There was no logical explanation.

That's when I heard it. A bloodcurdling scream from the front of the store. It was Maria. I barked into the walkie, ""Everyone to the front! Get to the doors now!""

We ran. When we got to her aisle, she was on the floor, convulsing, pointing a trembling finger at the darkness at the end of the aisle. ""It's… it's watching,"" she choked out. ""From the darkness…""

I felt a cold dread settle in my bones. I could feel a weight of unseen malice pressing down on me. The temperature dropped, and my breath plumed white. A tall, thin shadow glided between the shelves, and a single can of soup rocketed off a shelf, hitting the ground with a sickening clang near my feet.

The last hour was a living nightmare. The PA system crackled to life, filled with distorted whispers. The front doors, which were locked, began to slam open and shut on their own. We huddled together by the front doors, a cluster of terrified humanity, watching the store descend into chaos around us. Boxes flew, lights pulsed, disembodied voices snarled. I could see the other guys. Omar was on the floor, rocking back and forth, staring at something that wasn't there. Mikey and Jessica were holding each other, sobbing.

At 5:58 AM, a low, guttural growl came from all around us, and the temperature dropped to below freezing. We could see our breath, and a strange, metallic smell of rot filled the air. We were all staring at our watches, counting down the seconds. The store was going to kill us.

But then, at exactly 6:00 AM, the growl stopped. The lights stopped pulsing. The air cleared. The chaos had vanished. The store was spotless.

The front doors unlocked, and Mr. Henderson, the store director, walked in, a thermos of coffee in his hand. He took one look at our group huddled together by the front doors. ""Good morning, Anthony! Looks like you had a rough night. Ready for the tour?""

My heart sank. The morning tour. It was a weekly routine. The store manager and I would walk through the store together, him checking in on the state of the aisles, me giving him a rundown of the night. He was cheerful, oblivious.

""Yeah, Mr. Henderson, ready,"" I said, my voice hoarse.

We walked the aisles, him pointing out small things, me nodding, my mind reeling. ""Looks like you missed a spot on aisle five, Anthony. And the pet food aisle still looks a little rough.""

I looked at the perfectly stocked aisles. The dog food was neatly stacked. The cans were fronted. There was no mess. No chaos. Nothing. The store looked exactly the way we had left it at 6:00 AM, but my mind was screaming at me that this wasn't possible.

""Right,"" I said, my voice barely audible. ""We'll get it next time.""

He gave me a puzzled look but just smiled. ""Get home, Anthony. You look exhausted.""

I walked out of the store and into the cool Detroit morning. I looked at the building, at the pristine windows, at the empty parking lot. My mind was screaming. My body was shaking. He didn't see it. He didn't see the broken boxes, the flying carts, the blood-curdling screams. He didn't see the terror.

And I knew, with a horrifying certainty, that tonight, it would all begin again. And I didn't know if I could survive another night.

Wednesday Night

The drive to work tonight felt even heavier. The city was a ghost, its buildings dark and silent, and every streetlight seemed to be counting the seconds until I arrived. I sat in my car in the parking lot, the humid September air clinging to me, my hand shaking slightly as I turned the key. My mind was a whirlwind of memories from last night. The flying carts, the screams, the terrifying silence after it all stopped. And Mr. Henderson, with his cheerful, oblivious smile, standing in the middle of a store that was inexplicably pristine. It was a sick joke, a mind game that had my sanity hanging by a thread.

Inside the store, the tension was a physical presence. The hum of the lights, which had once been a comforting white noise, now sounded like a low, grinding vibration that set my teeth on edge. The team was different tonight. There was no easy chatter, no casual laughter. Maria and Jamal stood close together, talking in hushed tones, their eyes darting nervously towards the dark aisles. Liam had a perpetually tired look on his face, and he kept rubbing his eyes, as if trying to wake up from a nightmare.

""Alright, people, listen up,"" I said, my voice sounding strained even to my own ears. ""We're going to stick together tonight. We'll work in groups of three. No one goes anywhere alone.""

The team gave a collective, shaky nod. They knew. They'd seen it too. I just needed them to know that I was with them. We weren't crazy. We weren't alone in this.

The night started with an unnerving silence. For hours, nothing happened. The store was quiet, too quiet. The silence was more terrifying than the chaos from last night. It was a silence filled with anticipation, a silence that felt like a predator waiting for the right moment to strike. My phone was in my pocket, and I kept clenching my fist around it, my thumb hovering over the 9-1-1 button, even though I knew it was useless. Who would I call? ""Yeah, hi, I'm a night shift lead at a grocery store, and the store is haunted""?

Around 2:00 AM, the whispers started. Low, unintelligible whispers that seemed to follow us through the aisles. I was stocking canned goods with Maria and Jamal when I heard my name, whispered right behind me. I whirled around, but no one was there. My blood ran cold. The aisle was empty. I could hear Maria muttering a prayer under her breath.

The whispers began to target us, getting more personal, more malicious. I was walking with Derek down the main aisle when I heard a faint, high-pitched giggle from the snack aisle. It was the laugh of a child, but it was hollow and devoid of joy. Derek's face went white.

""Did you hear that?"" he asked, his voice barely a whisper.

I just nodded, my heart pounding against my ribs.

Then, from the darkness of a back aisle, I heard a new voice. It was Omar's. He was stocking cereal, and a faint whisper, clear as day, came from the end of the aisle. “You’re a failure, Omar. Your family is ashamed of you.” Omar froze, his eyes wide with a mix of fear and hurt. I ran to him, but the whisper had already done its damage. He looked at me, his eyes full of tears, and he said, ""How did it know?""

The rest of the night was a slow descent into madness. The whispers were everywhere, and they weren't just random sounds anymore. They were our deepest fears, our worst memories, coming to life. Chloe was in the health and beauty section when a whisper, in a mocking, sing-song voice, said, “Your art is worthless.” They dropped their stock gun, their face a mask of pain. Brenda was in the paper goods aisle when a whisper, in a cruel, high-pitched voice, said, “No one loves you, Brenda.” She started to cry, her shoulders shaking with silent sobs.

I was trying to comfort Brenda when I heard a distinct sound from the deli section. The sound of a meat slicer turning on. I ran over, my heart in my throat. The slicer was on, its blade spinning, and it was slicing thin, perfect sheets of… nothing. The machine was running on its own, a chilling sound in the quiet store. A voice, a low, guttural growl, came from the slicer itself. “We are… hungry… for… your… flesh.”

At 5:00 AM, the lights started to act up. They didn't just flicker. They pulsed with a new, frantic energy. The shadows in the aisles deepened and writhed, and I could swear I saw the shape of a person in the shadows, a fleeting glimpse that vanished when I blinked. I looked at my watch. An hour left. An hour until salvation.

The whispers coalesced into a single, malevolent voice from the store’s PA system, loud and clear. “WE ARE… INSIDE… YOUR… MINDS…” The words reverberated through the very foundation of the store.

I looked at my team, their faces etched with the lingering echoes of what they had just endured. They were huddled together by the front doors, a cluster of terrified humanity, waiting for the slaughter. I could see the despair in their eyes. They had been broken. We had all been broken.

Then, at exactly 6:00 AM, the PA system went silent. The lights stopped pulsing. The air cleared. The rotten smell was replaced by the clean, sterile scent of a grocery store. The front doors unlocked with a gentle whoosh.

Mr. Henderson walked in, with his usual thermos of coffee in hand. He took one look at our group. ""Woah, you look beat,"" he said, his voice cheerful and oblivious. ""Let's do the tour. How's the store looking?""

I just nodded, my teeth chattering from the lingering cold. We walked the aisles, him pointing out small things, me nodding, my mind reeling. ""Looks like you missed a tiny section on aisle three, Anthony. And the pet food aisle looks much better than yesterday.""

I stared at the perfectly stocked aisles. Everything was neatly stacked. Nothing out of place. But in my mind, I could still hear the whispers. I could still see the terrified faces of my team. I could still feel the terror.

""Right,"" I said, my voice barely audible. ""We'll get it next time.""

Again he gave me a puzzled look but just smiled. ""Go on home, Anthony. Get some rest.""

I walked out into the cool Detroit morning, my body shaking, my mind a mess. The whispers were gone, but their words still echoed in my mind. They knew me. They knew my team. They knew our deepest fears. And they had used them against us.

I looked back at the store. The morning sun hit the windows, and the building looked perfectly normal. But I knew better. I knew what was lurking in the dark heart of this store. And I knew, with a horrifying, gut-wrenching certainty, that tonight, it would all begin again. And I was terrified of what it would say to us.

Thursday Night

Tonight, the drive felt like a commute to an execution. My stomach was in knots, and the city lights seemed to mock me with their normalcy. The sight of the building, a fortress of glass and steel, filled me with a cold dread. I knew what waited inside. I knew what the store had done to us.

The team was different tonight. The whispers had broken us. No one was talking, not even in hushed tones. They all just stared at the floor, their faces pale and drawn. Omar was openly carrying a small wooden cross, his knuckles white as he clutched it. Liam had his headphones in, but I knew he wasn't listening to music. He was trying to drown out the whispers.

""Alright, everyone,"" I said, my voice barely a whisper. ""Let's stick together. We'll work in groups of four. No one separates. We'll get through this.""

The first few hours were unnervingly quiet, but it was a cold, tense quiet. The hum of the lights, the rumble of a distant truck, it all felt like the shallow breaths of a waiting predator. The silence was more terrifying than the chaos. It was a silence that was filled with anticipation, a silence that felt like a trap waiting to be sprung.

Just after midnight, the doors to the back stockroom slammed shut with a sickening clank. The deadbolt audibly slid into place. I ran back there, my heart pounding against my ribs. I tried the handle, but it wouldn't turn. The metal was unnaturally cold. The door was locked from the inside. We were trapped.

""The back door's locked!"" I yelled, my voice strained. ""We're locked in!""

A wave of dread rippled through the team. Derek rushed to the front entrance, frantically swiping his keycard, but the doors wouldn't budge. The green light blinked, but the doors wouldn't slide open. We were completely sealed inside. The store was a cage, and we were the rats.

That's when the new sounds started. The ghostly echoes of screams. Not from my team, but from somewhere inside the store. A faint cry from the canned goods section, a wail from the toy aisle. They sounded like a chorus of tormented souls. I saw a fleeting, transparent figure of a woman in a long, tattered dress gliding through the paper towel aisle. Her head was tilted, her long hair obscuring her face, and her hands were clasped over her ears, as if trying to block out the screams. She wasn't solid, just a shimmering, spectral thing. She turned her head, and for a second, I saw her face. Her eyes were hollowed-out black pits, and her mouth was a gaping, silent scream. She was one of them.

Around 4:00 AM, the lights went out. Not just flickered. They went out. Completely. The emergency lights in the store were dead. We were plunged into absolute darkness. My phone’s screen flickered, and the light went out. It was a new kind of terror. The fear of what was in the darkness, of what we couldn't see.

Then, a light came on. A faint, spectral glow coming from the frozen foods aisle. It was a face, a woman with long black hair, her eyes glowing with a malevolent light. She was floating, her feet not touching the ground, gliding silently down the aisle towards us. Her mouth was open in a silent scream.

I grabbed Liam and yelled, ""Get back!""

We scrambled away from the glowing figure. The rest of the team scattered, their phones and walkie-talkies dead, leaving us in a world of complete, terrifying darkness. I could hear whimpers and muffled prayers. Then, a new sound came. A deep, guttural growl that echoed from the furthest aisles, a sound that made my teeth chatter and my bones ache. It was no longer playing games. It was hunting.

I was huddled with Maria and Derek by the front doors, our backs to the glass, when I saw it. The reflection in the glass was not our own. It was a distorted, decaying version of us, our faces gaunt, our eyes hollowed-out black pits. We looked like the ghost of the woman I had just seen. We were becoming them. We were becoming a part of the store.

I looked at my watch, my mind in a haze of fear. 5:58 AM. Two minutes. Just two minutes until the store opened. I just had to survive for two more minutes.

A low, guttural growl came from all around us, and the temperature dropped to below freezing. We could see our breath, and a strange, metallic smell of rot filled the air. I felt a cold hand on my shoulder, its fingers like ice. A voice, a chilling, ancient rasp, filled my head. “Five-hundred-and-fifty-three-seconds… until… we… own… you.”

I closed my eyes, a single, helpless tear rolling down my cheek. I was ready. I was done fighting.

Then, at exactly 6:00 AM, the emergency exit light above the front door flickered green.

The cacophony of terror instantly ceased. The lights in the store flickered, then returned to their normal, even hum. The oppressive cold lifted. The metallic stench dissipated. The store was spotless. The back door was ajar.

Mr. Henderson walked in, a giant smile on his face. ""Morning, Anthony! Let's do the tour, so you can get on home.""

I looked at him, then at the store. My mind was screaming, but my body just nodded. We walked the aisles, him telling me about the truck size for the night, me nodding, my mind reeling. ""Looks like you missed a spot, no I'm just joking with ya, Anthony. Everything looks great!

I stared at the perfectly stocked aisles. mess. My mind still reeling, I could still hear the screams. I could still see the terrified faces of my team. I could still feel the terror.

""Right,"" I said, my voice barely audible. ""We'll see ya tomorrow boss.""

He gave me a confused look for a moment, then just smiled. ""Anthony go get some rest. Big night ahead.""

I walked out into the cool Detroit morning, my body shaking, my mind a mess. The screams were gone, but their words still echoed in my mind. They knew me. They knew my team. They knew our deepest fears. And they had used them against us. The store wasn't just a place. It was a living, breathing thing. And it was going to make sure that tonight, we wouldn't forget.

Friday Night

The drive to work tonight was a surreal experience. It felt like I was in a car that wasn't moving, trapped in a single, repeating frame of my life. Every street light, every building, every car seemed to mock me with its mundane reality. I pulled into the parking lot and sat there for a full five minutes, my hands shaking on the steering wheel. I could feel the store waiting for me, its massive, dark form a living, breathing thing. I was a rat, and it was a cage.

When I walked in, the air was a thick, oppressive blanket of heat and the sickly sweet smell of decay. It was the same smell I had smelled last night. The store was not just haunted. It was rotting.

My team was already there, huddled by the front doors. They weren't speaking. They were just staring at the floor, their faces a pale, pasty white. Liam had a rosary clutched in his hands, his lips moving silently in prayer. Brenda was crying, silent tears streaming down her face. Omar was on the floor, rocking back and forth, staring at the floor. He was gone. The whispers had broken him.

I walked up to them, my voice a hollow whisper. ""The back door is locked already. It won't budge.""

The lights in the store began to pulse slowly, a sickening, heartbeat rhythm. The hum was gone, replaced by a low, guttural vibration that seemed to come from the floor itself. It felt like the store was alive, its walls breathing, its aisles ready to swallow us whole.

I tried to give orders, but my voice trembled. ""Okay, let's… let's stick together. We'll work in groups. We won't separate, not for a second.""

I started walking towards the dairy section with Maria and Derek. We were just passing the cereal aisle when I heard the first sound. A soft, wet thump. We all froze. We looked up. The ceiling tile was dislodged, and a glistening black liquid was slowly dripping from the crack, smelling of tar and something else… something foul and metallic. It hit the floor with another thump, spreading into a small black puddle that seemed to move on its own, its edges twitching.

""What is that?"" Maria whispered, her voice a thin thread of fear.

The lights pulsed again, brighter this time, and I saw a movement in the darkness at the end of the aisle. A shape, low to the ground, with limbs that seemed to bend the wrong way. It scuttled towards us, a chittering sound coming from it. My flashlight beam found it—a creature of shadow and bone, its skin stretched thin over a skeletal frame. Its head was too large for its body, and its eyes were two glowing points of malevolent red.

""Run!"" I screamed.

We ran, scrambling away from the chittering horror. The rest of the team saw it and scattered, the plan of ""sticking together"" forgotten. It was a stampede of terror. The creature of shadow and bone was fast. It scuttled past the end of the aisle and a scream echoed from somewhere in the canned goods section. It was Omar.

""Omar!"" I yelled into the walkie-talkie. But there was no response, only a faint, gurgling sound followed by static.

My heart was a frantic drum. I ran with Maria and Derek towards the front of the store, our flashlights cutting through the oppressive darkness. Then, I heard a terrible, ripping sound from the produce section. We ran past and saw a horrifying sight. The spectral woman from the other night was there, but she wasn’t transparent anymore. She was solid, a ghostly white, and she was reaching out with her long, clawed fingers, literally tearing the skin from Jamal's face. The look of agony on his face was a portrait of pure, unadulterated terror. He didn't even scream. He couldn't.

""Jamal!"" Maria shrieked. But it was too late. He fell to the ground, his face a bloody, torn mess. We ran. There was nothing we could do.

We made it to the front of the store, where the rest of the team had gathered. Liam was sobbing, Derek was hyperventilating, and Brenda was clutching Patricia’s hand so tightly her knuckles were white.

A new sound began. A low, grinding, dragging sound, like something impossibly heavy being pulled across the floor. We watched in horror as a refrigerator in the dairy section slowly began to slide across the floor on its own, its metal grating against the concrete. The lights pulsed with a new, frantic energy.

Then, I saw it. The tall, faceless figure from the night before was standing at the end of the main aisle, its long, thin arms stretched out, casting monstrous, terrifying shadows that reached all the way to our feet. The shadows had a life of their own. They slithered up the walls and across the ceiling, seeming to watch us, waiting.

The thing began to move. It glided towards us, a slow, methodical advance, its gait utterly unnatural, its legs bending in impossible angles. It was hunting us.

""The doors!"" Derek screamed, running to the front entrance. He swiped his keycard again and again. The green light blinked, but the doors wouldn’t open. They were still locked.

I grabbed him. ""They're not opening, Derek! They never will!"" My voice was a raw, primal scream.

The lights suddenly flickered and went out completely. The entire store was plunged into total darkness. The only light was the eerie, pulsing red glow from the eyes of the chittering creature in the distance, and the terrifying, empty space where the tall thing's face should have been. A chorus of unearthly screams and wails, a symphony of torment, filled the store. I could hear things moving in the darkness, all around us.

""We have to do something!"" Maria screamed.

Suddenly, a flashlight beam cut through the darkness. It was Liam. He had his phone out, and he was frantically typing. ""The store's Wi-Fi! I'm trying to post to Reddit! Maybe someone will see it! The store, it's—""

His words were cut off by a wet, sickening crunch. His flashlight fell to the ground, its beam illuminating a pair of glowing red eyes and a shadowy figure hunched over a crumpled form. The chittering sound was now a gurgling, triumphant sound.

We were alone. We were the last ones. The thing was picking us off, one by one. I could feel its gaze on me. It was close. I could hear its wet, dragging footsteps. I could feel its cold, rotten breath on my neck.

Then, from the darkness, a voice, a single, clear, disembodied whisper, filled my head. “Five-hundred-and-fifty-three-seconds… until… we… own… you.”

I looked at my watch. It was 5:51 AM. The time was a countdown. Not until the store opened, but until it had us. I could hear the others screaming, running, but I couldn't move. My feet were rooted to the floor. The voice was in my head, a terrifying, silent countdown.

The shadow creature was in the darkness beside me. I felt a cold hand on my shoulder, a hand that was impossibly long and thin. The voice whispered again.

“Five-hundred-and-fifty-two…”

I closed my eyes, a single, helpless tear rolling down my cheek. This was it. There was no escape. We were going to be a part of this store forever.

“Fifty-one…”

I heard a scream from my right. Brenda's. I didn't open my eyes. I didn't want to see it. I didn't want to see what was happening to them. I just wanted it to be over.

“Fifty…”

I felt the presence of the tall, faceless thing. Its cold, rotten breath was right in front of me.

“Forty-nine…”

I heard the last screams of my team, the sound of tearing flesh, the gurgling of blood. And I knew it was coming for me next.

“Thirty-five… thirty… twenty-one… fifteen…”

The voice in my head was a mocking, sing-song sound. It was drawing out my death, savoring my terror.

“Ten… nine… eight… seven… six…”

I felt the freezing cold of a hand on my face, its fingers like ice. The smell of decay was overpowering.

“Five… four… three…”

Then, a sudden, blinding light filled the store.

“TWO…”

The hand on my face was gone. The cold was gone. The screams were gone. All the terrifying sounds had ceased.

The lights were on. The automatic doors were unlocking. The store was spotless. The back door was ajar. A cheerful voice boomed from the front.

""Good morning, Anthony! Looks like you had an early start today. The place is sparkling!"" Mr. Henderson beamed, walking in with that stupid thermos in his hand.

I looked at him, then at the empty front of the store. There was no one. Maria, Derek, Brenda, Frank… they were all gone. The only thing left was the chilling, nauseating memory of what had just happened.

""Where... where's my team?"" I asked, my voice a broken whisper.

Mr. Henderson's smile faltered. ""Anthony, what are you talking about? You're the overnight crew. We don't have anyone named  Maria, Derek, Brenda working nights... We have you, our star night lead. You've been working alone for weeks. You're our best closer...are you feeling alright?""

My heart stopped. Alone? I looked at my hands, my trembling hands, which felt cold and sticky. I looked at the perfectly clean, perfectly normal store. I felt the overwhelming, crushing weight of a memory that couldn't possibly be real, and yet I knew was.

I ran to the back, to the breakroom, and looked at the corkboard where we usually kept our schedules. It was blank. There were no names on it but mine. The other lockers were empty. There were no signs of a team anywhere.

I turned back to the store, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The aisles stretched out before me, long and pristine. A mocking, silent grin was plastered on my face. The store didn't want my soul. It had already taken it. It had been playing a game with me, making me relive the same terrifying nights over and over again, each time stripping away a piece of my sanity. The ghosts weren't just in the store. They were in my head.

The voice in my head, a whisper I could not ignore, spoke to me one last time. ""You're not alone, Anthony. They're here. They’re all here… and they're waiting for you.""

I looked at my reflection in the glass of the front door. Behind my own terrified face, I saw something else. A faint, shimmering reflection of the team that was no longer there. Maria, Derek, Brenda, Frank… all of them, their faces gaunt, their eyes hollowed out black pits. They were staring back at me, a silent chorus of tormented souls. They were here. And they were waiting for me. They had a new member of their team.

And I was the last one left. I was alone. Forever.",1,1758616354.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1nobv90,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1nobv90/navigating_ex_joining_family_gym/,Navigating ex joining family gym,"I need some advice on a situation. I 26F dated a guy 27M for 4-5 years.

Some background (sorry it’s going to be a bit of an essay) - The relationship was great and he treated me extremely well for the most part. We went through a lot together, met in high school, reconnected in university and the relationship sustained even through me moving overseas for exchange for 6 months. We raised a dog together.

The only thing was, he was in the field of medicine. Which made things quite hard for us. He moved about 2 hrs away and had crazy hours. Although we tried to make time for each other, it was often difficult because when he did have downtime he was exhausted from work and would end up resting/sleeping for the most part. I had communicated multiple times that this was putting strain on me because I felt that even though I was in a relationship, I was alone.

In the last year of our relationship, he had to apply to be placed somewhere for the following year (community service year). He mentioned the application a few times casually. It was never a serious sit down conversation between us, but long story short he ended up applying for a placement at the further est possible location. He didn’t even apply for work in our home town/city and said it was a career based decision because there are no good work opportunities in our home town/city. But said that after the community service year he would come back to our home town/city for me. Which made no sense to me at the time because of his reasoning.

When work died down for me and reality sunk in when he was placed, I came to the realization that this hadn’t really been the serious conversation it needed to be. I was upset and hurt because I felt like I wasn’t really considered in the decision. He assumed I would be completely fine with long distance, even though the “medium distance” situation at the time was taking its toll. So in the end, I ended things with him - not only due to the distance but the lack of communication and consideration for our relationship.

When we ended things in December last year, it was amicable - I even gave him his Christmas gift early. I thanked him for all he did for me and for the way he treated me. But as the months went on I felt an anger at the complacency he demonstrated in the last few months of the relationship.

I didn’t hear from him for the most part. I started dating someone in June this year for about 2 months but it didn’t work out.

When I was dating this new person though, I heard my ex had joined my gym in my home town. Which was odd because he was not living there - he was across the country. Just fyi- this boxing gym is sponsored by my dad’s company, my family is there (sister, dad, aunt) and so are my friends. It’s right opposite my dad’s company offices. And there is a long standing association between my family and this gym. My ex never really went there unless it was a couple times together when we were dating. He actually preferred a different boxing gym. He struck up a conversation with my sister and mentioned he is taking leave from work 1 week of each month and spending it in our home town from now on.

When I found this out I was upset, and a bit angry. He reinserted himself months after the breakup into a place I felt was my safe space. I freaked out and stopped going to the gym for fear I’d run into him.

Flash forward to this week. I have started going back to the boxing gym. I love the sense of community - my family and friends. I bump into him. He is wearing my dad’s company (heavily branded) tshirt. We greet each other but I’m freaking out inside. At the end of the session, I approach him, am really friendly and make some small talk. I ask him if he is free after the session to grab a coffee. He winces and pauses and says he doesn’t know that’s a good idea out of respect for the person he is seeing. I quickly reassure him that’s not my intention and that I just want to clear the air since we are both going to the same gym. He agrees to go for a coffee opposite the gym. I’m waiting at the cafe for him to finish his session. I see him coming out and calling someone - I presume his new girl to ask her permission to talk to me ? We chat for a bit, small talk about family, career etc and just catching up. It was friendly. I ask him why he’s at the gym. He says he thinks it’s fine cause I’m not really there and also we “ended on really good terms”. Ps, I’m all over the gyms Instagram. But he says if it’s an issue he can go elsewhere. In the moment I say it’s fine and a place for everyone to train. We shows me my dog is still his screensaver…

I couldn’t help but feel sad. So I wanted to leave. I called it quickly and said I had to get going. We hugged and said bye.

Now all I feel is anger and sadness. He has this concern for his new gf but no concern or respect for me/ my space/ my family? I couldn’t be more confused on how to feel.

I also have this feeling his new girlfriend lives in our home town.

This happened a few days ago. It’s his birthday today. I don’t know how to go about this situation in general - do I ask him to train elsewhere? Do I continue as normal even though it hurts to see him? I don’t want him to think I’m bothered or jealous of his new gf. Truth is I don’t know how I’m feeling. And I don’t know if I should wish him or not?? Help…",1,1758616112.0,datingadvice,2,1.0,False

Went for an informal chat via Zoom which I felt went fell. They said they’d be in touch by end of week about next steps. Come Friday, I hear nothing. I don’t have LinkedIn notifications on my phone, but when I got up on Sunday morning, I receive an email from LinkedIn about a new message from them. It was Sunday 9am. It was a rejection, which is ok, but why did they message me on Sunday morning? Do hiring managers treat LinkedIn in a more relaxed way than emails (our whole communication was very casual via LinkedIn chats)? I personally think it shows bad company culture, and also lack of respect. This could have waited until Monday morning, but instead it showed they worked on weekend, and obviously me reading the message on Sunday spoiled my whole day (which is meant to be a day off from thinking about work). I also asked my friends and they agree the fact they messaged me on Sunday morning is a red flag about the company culture. It’s important to mention that my industry is really relaxed and interviews are normally very informal (meet for a coffee type of thing) and the communication is too. Not sure if I’m not overthinking this, but I’m disappointed with the outcome and a bit annoyed about finding out on a Sunday. ",0,1758616075.0,UKJobs,13,0.5,False

I can chat with anyone, I have deep conversations with mums at the school gate, I know all my neighbours, and I often make random people laugh and smile (it took me 15minutes to buy a coffee last week as I had a heart to heart with the barista about her kids).

But I’m so fucking lonely. My colleagues all say I’m lovely and occasionally we go for lunch, my business mentor genuinely cares about me and my therapist is awesome. My kid adores me and my husband is kind (although away a lot). So why I am sobbing my eyes out in the office toilets, or breaking into tears when I watch girl squads on TikTok? 

Since having a kid my relationship with my family has tanked - some cut me off bc they had mental health issues triggered by me becoming pregnant, others drifted away bc mom-me wasn’t able to travel (and party), and my parents aren’t great with small kids (although they love them a lot). 

I have hardly any time to socialise but when I do, I go for coffee and try to build relationships with the awesome women I’ve met through parenting. I feel like I know everyone but no one is my actual friend. And when I look at my family I wonder if it’s a problem with me - Is this normal?

1nobt81,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nobt81/the_abyssal_idol/,The Abyssal Idol,"**Part I: Discovery**

The first time the anomaly appeared on sonar, no one thought much of it.

The Argo Deep was three weeks into its six-week survey of the Cascadia Abyssal Plain, and most of what they mapped was as monotonous as the desert — empty seafloor, gently undulating, with the occasional black smoker vent or jagged scar where tectonic plates had disagreed long before men learned to draw maps. The crew had grown used to staring at the same sets of blips and grids on the monitors. Sometimes they joked about it — how they were the most overeducated cartographers in the world, drawing the ocean’s bones one ping at a time.

But then the sonar technician, Alvarez, frowned.

It was a small thing. He had been half-asleep over the console, sipping his third cup of burnt coffee, when the sweep returned a cluster of reflections that didn’t belong.

“Dr. Keene,” he called over his shoulder. His voice carried easily in the quiet control room. “Can you take a look at this?”

Dr. Sarah Keene, chief oceanographer, leaned over. She had spent her career in deep-sea geology, her patience worn to diamond-hard tolerance by years of squinting at irregularities only to find out they were noise, or shadows, or boulders dropped from icebergs centuries ago. But Alvarez’s tone had a thread of unease in it, and she followed his gaze.

On the grid, a shape stood where nothing should. Rising from the flatness of the plain, almost vertical. Too smooth, too regular.

“Depth?” she asked.

“Just shy of seven thousand meters,” Alvarez said. His eyes flicked to her, the corners tight. “No trench nearby. No ridge.”

Keene studied the return. The object wasn’t massive by seafloor standards — maybe thirty meters high, if the readings weren’t distorted — but its angles bothered her. Not jagged like rock. Not amorphous like coral. Sharp. Deliberate.

“Probably an error,” she said at last, though even she didn’t believe it.

Still, she logged the coordinates.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

By morning, the anomaly had become the thing everyone whispered about.

The Argo Deep carried a mixed crew: scientists, engineers, submersible pilots, a skeleton staff of Navy observers whose funding had quietly greased the expedition. They’d seen enough oddities to know most mysteries shrank under scrutiny, but boredom was a powerful fuel for rumor.

At breakfast, the pilots speculated whether it might be a shipwreck. Alvarez swore it was too big. One of the Navy men suggested it could be Cold War debris; some long-forgotten satellite or weapons platform dumped into the black.

Keene said nothing. She only watched the numbers.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

That evening, the captain gave her the go-ahead.

“Send one of the drones,” he said, folding his arms as if bracing for disappointment. “Clear it up before the crew gets carried away.”

Keene agreed. She wanted answers too.

The ROV — Heron II — was lowered after dark, its lights slicing into the churning surface before it vanished into the endless descent. Everyone crowded the control room to watch the feed.

Five hundred meters down, blue still lingered. At a thousand, the light turned to murk. At three thousand, black swallowed everything but the drone’s beams.

The deeper it went, the quieter the room grew.

At six thousand meters, Keene felt her throat tighten. The drone’s altimeter ticked closer to the seafloor. She leaned forward, waiting.

“Contact in one hundred meters,” Alvarez said softly.

The cameras cut through the dark, showing swirls of silt, slow-drifting pelagic creatures, an occasional pale fish darting from the beams.

Then the ground appeared. Flat, rippling, empty — until something vast loomed in the distance.

Not a rock. Not a wreck.

It rose from the plain, impossible in its symmetry. A column at first glance, but as the drone approached, the truth sharpened into focus:

A face.

A face larger than the submersible itself, carved in cold stone. The eyes were hollow, gaping. The mouth hung open in a silent scream, its proportions wrong — too wide, too long, not meant for a human skull.

The crew stared in silence.

“My God,” whispered Alvarez.

Keene’s pulse thundered in her ears. The camera tilted, revealing shoulders buried in silt, a torso half-swallowed by the plain. It wasn’t just a face. It was a statue.

And no one could explain how it had come to rest nearly seven kilometers beneath the waves.

**Part II: Descent**

The debate lasted less than twelve hours.

Captain Morrow wanted nothing to do with it. He had signed on to ferry scientists, not to flirt with the abyss. The Navy observers were split — one cautious, one eager to claim whatever prize lay waiting on the seafloor. Keene herself pressed hardest.

“We can’t leave it unexplored,” she argued in the wardroom, standing with her palms flat against the chart table. “If this is man-made, it’s the most significant archaeological discovery of the century. No civilization on record had the technology to build at that depth. It rewrites—”

“It kills,” Morrow interrupted. His voice was flat, graveled with too many years at sea. “If something goes wrong, there’s no rescue. Not at seven thousand meters.”

Keene met his gaze. Her heart beat hard, but she didn’t look away. “That’s why we have the Scylla. She was built for this. Titanium hull, full redundancy. If we don’t dive, someone else will, and they won’t have our equipment. Or our care.”

The room fell quiet.

Finally, Lieutenant Hale — the younger Navy man, all square jaw and ambition — leaned forward. “One dive. Minimal crew. Document the site. If it’s nothing, we’re done.”

Morrow muttered something under his breath, but he didn’t argue further.

And so, it was decided.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The Scylla waited in her cradle, gleaming under floodlights, a steel sphere built for three. Her viewports were narrow, her arms delicate, her body designed to withstand pressure that would crush most submarines to powder.

Keene would go. Alvarez, despite his nerves, volunteered to pilot — he trusted machines more than men. The third seat was filled by Lieutenant Hale, who refused to let the civilians dive without military oversight.

They launched at dawn. The sea was calm, the kind of surface stillness that always made Keene uneasy — as if the ocean, for once, was pretending to sleep.

The descent began smoothly. Numbers scrolled across the consoles, depth ticking steadily downward.

A thousand meters. The light drained away. Keene pressed her face to the viewport, watching jellyfish pulse like lanterns, their bodies ghost-pale in the dark.

Three thousand. Fish with unblinking eyes drifted past, silent as thoughts. The water grew thicker, blacker, a weight pressing from all sides.

Five thousand. Hale had stopped speaking, his earlier bravado stripped away by the immensity outside. Only Alvarez muttered occasionally, coaxing the sub, whispering like a priest at a shrine.

Six thousand, six hundred.

Keene’s breath fogged the glass. She was trying to steady her heartbeat when the seafloor appeared — an endless gray plain, dusted with silt, lifeless. And then, rising from it, the idol.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Up close, it dwarfed them.

The statue’s head alone was at least twice the size of the Scylla. Its features were almost human, but stretched and distorted, as though sculpted by someone who had only heard of mankind, never seen it. The eyes were vast pits. The nose was flattened, the mouth open wide enough for the submersible to glide into, if they dared.

“Christ,” Hale whispered.

Keene could barely hear him. Her own thoughts clamored, disbelieving. The material looked like stone, but smoother, darker, as if time and pressure had polished it. Carvings ran along the visible torso — spirals, notches, grooves that made no sense to the eye, as though written in an alphabet meant for something else entirely.

Alvarez angled the floodlights higher. The beams struck the hollow eyes, and for a moment it seemed as though the idol stared back.

Keene shuddered. She told herself it was only imagination, but the sensation lingered — an awareness pressing against her skin, as though something vast and waiting had noticed them.

“Get closer,” she said, her voice steadier than she felt.

Alvarez maneuvered the sub forward. The arms extended, brushing silt from the carvings. The grooves were deep, purposeful. Even after centuries, they had not eroded.

“Take samples,” Hale ordered, his tone clipped, as if speaking too loudly might wake it.

The manipulator scraped a fragment loose. The sound — a screech of metal against stone — reverberated through the hull. Keene winced. The shard clattered into the sample bin, dull and heavy.

Alvarez swore softly. “This isn’t natural,” he said. “It’s not basalt, not any formation I’ve seen.”

Keene leaned closer to the viewport, eyes drawn inexorably to the idol’s mouth. Inside the dark hollow, patterns glistened faintly. For a moment, she thought she saw movement — a ripple, a shiver deeper within.

“Pull back,” she whispered.

But Alvarez’s hands hesitated on the controls. His eyes were wide, glassy. Hale noticed and snapped, “I said pull back!”

The sub lurched as Alvarez obeyed, backing away from the idol’s face. Keene tore her gaze from the mouth, her skin crawling.

They ascended in silence.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Back aboard the Argo Deep, the crew swarmed them with questions. What had they seen? What was it made of? How could it exist?

Keene answered what she could, though each word felt inadequate. She kept her eyes on the fragment Alvarez had retrieved, now sealed in a container on the lab bench. It was heavier than it should be, almost metallic, its surface etched with spirals too fine to have been cut by ancient tools.

When she touched the glass, her fingers tingled.

That night, when she finally collapsed into her bunk, sleep did not come easily. And when it did, it brought her dreams of hollow eyes staring from the dark, and a voice whispering through fathoms of water — words she did not understand, but which seemed to understand her.

**Part III: The Idol**

The fragment sat sealed in its container, but no one wanted to be near it.

By protocol, Keene logged it, labeled it, and placed it in the ship’s geology lab. But even through the thick plexiglass of the sample case, the shard drew attention. Crew passing through the lab would glance at it and then look away quickly, as if they’d stared too long at a body on the roadside.

It was darker than stone should be — almost black, yet it caught the light strangely, as though it swallowed it and reflected it back in patterns too complex for the eye to follow. Fine etchings ran across its surface, spirals within spirals, lines that seemed to shift when Keene wasn’t looking directly at them.

By the second day, she noticed people avoiding the lab altogether.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

That night, the dreams began.

Keene woke gasping, drenched in sweat, certain that water had been pouring into her cabin. She’d dreamed of corridors flooding, bulkheads groaning, the ship sinking with impossible speed. But what lingered most was the face. That vast, hollow-eyed face staring at her through the dream.

At breakfast, Alvarez looked haggard. “You too?” he asked quietly, when the others weren’t listening.

She nodded.

“I dreamt…” He trailed off, his hands tightening around his mug. “It was here. On the ship. Standing in the corridor. Too big to fit, but it was there. Watching.”

Before Keene could reply, Hale slid into the seat across from them. He hadn’t slept either — his uniform was rumpled, his eyes bloodshot.

“Whatever it is,” he muttered, “we should drop it back where it came from. Before it decides it wants more than dreams.”

Alvarez flinched. “You don’t think it’s—”

“I don’t know what it is,” Hale cut in sharply. “But I know I don’t want it here.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The lab equipment didn't disagree with him.

On the third day, Keene ran density tests on the fragment. The readings came back inconsistent — not impossible, but off enough that she reran them. The second set contradicted the first. So did the third. The numbers seemed to shift, as though the shard were changing under her instruments.

When she tried spectroscopy, the machine flickered, screens glitching before returning only static. Alvarez checked the circuits for her twice; nothing was wrong.

“Like it doesn’t want to be measured,” he said softly.

Keene didn’t reply, but she thought of the eyes. The way they had seemed to follow her, even in the crushing dark.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

By the end of the week, the ship felt different.

Conversations stopped when Keene entered a room. People spoke in low voices, as if afraid of being overheard. Meals were quicker, laughter gone. Even Captain Morrow walked with shoulders hunched, as if weighed down by invisible chains.

Every night, the dreams grew worse. Some woke to the sound of knocking at their doors. Others swore they heard whispers in the ventilation shafts, words garbled but urgent. Hale startled awake one morning with his bunkmate shaking him, after he’d begun speaking in a language no one recognized.

And through it all, the fragment remained in its case, untouched. Waiting.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

On the eighth day, Keene found Alvarez staring at the sample. He hadn’t noticed her enter. His face was pale, drawn, eyes fixed on the spirals that writhed faintly across the black surface.

“Alvarez,” she said carefully.

He blinked, as though surfacing from deep water. His lips parted. “It’s not carved.”

“What?”

He pointed. “The lines. They’re...not carved. They’re growing. Changing. Look—”

Keene leaned closer. Unease coiled in her chest. The grooves were not static; they shifted subtly, curling into new configurations, as though something alive inside the stone was pressing against the surface.

Revulsion tightened her throat. She backed away.

“Seal the lab,” she ordered.

But as she turned, she saw Hale standing in the doorway. He had heard everything.

And the look in his eyes told her what she feared most: he had already decided the only way to end this was to put the Scylla back in the water — and return the fragment to the idol’s waiting mouth.

**Part IV: Influence**

The Argo Deep had always been a quiet ship, but now the silence turned poisonous.

The crew avoided one another in the corridors. Meals were eaten quickly, in tense solitude, trays abandoned half-full. Even the hum of the engines seemed subdued, as if the ship itself had grown cautious, unwilling to draw attention.

Keene caught bits of conversations — whispers about the fragment, mutters about omens. One sailor crossed himself when she passed, muttering under his breath. Another asked outright if she had “brought it aboard on purpose.”

It was superstition, yes. But it was spreading.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The dreams worsened.

Keene woke one night to find water trickling down her bunk wall. She sat up, heart hammering, and touched it. Dry. When she looked again, the rivulets were gone.

Alvarez stopped sleeping altogether. His hands shook, and his eyes darted constantly, as if searching for something just beyond the edge of vision. He confessed to her in a whisper that he’d begun hearing voices on the comm systems — static resolving into words, speaking in the same alien spirals etched into the fragment.

“It wants us back,” he said hoarsely. “It’s calling us.”

Keene wanted to dismiss it. But she had heard whispers too. Sometimes in the pipes, sometimes in the sea itself — the faint, distorted sound of someone calling her name from miles away.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The first accident happened on the tenth day.

One of the junior engineers was found in the machine shop, standing stock-still with a length of steel gripped in both hands. When spoken to, he didn’t respond. His lips moved soundlessly, whispering patterns in the same cadence as Alvarez’s comms.

When Hale reached for him, the man swung the steel bar without hesitation. It took three others to restrain him. He clawed and screamed until they sedated him, shouting about “eyes in the dark” and “the mouth that waits.”

The crew quarantined him in the infirmary. After that, no one wanted to pass the lab, not even to fetch supplies. The fragment lay alone, but its influence seeped through bulkheads and rivets, filling the ship like ballast.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Two nights later, Keene woke to a faint sound in her cabin.

Knocking.

Three taps, slow and deliberate, on the inside of her porthole.

She froze, staring at the blackness outside the glass. No one, no...thing, should be able to reach it and yet — knock. Knock. Knock.

Her body moved before her mind did. She slammed the porthole cover shut and pressed her back against the wall, shaking until dawn.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Captain Morrow convened an emergency meeting. His voice was brittle, his face hollow.

“This ends now,” he said. “We’re jettisoning the sample. Seal it in a container and drop it overboard.”

Keene felt a flash of relief — until she saw Hale’s expression. The lieutenant’s jaw was tight, his knuckles white.

“You can’t just throw it away,” he snapped. “That thing is worth more than this entire ship. We don’t destroy discoveries. We study them.”

“It’s not your decision,” Morrow shot back. “I’m master of this vessel. And I won’t let it sink under us.”

The two men glared at each other, silence thick as oil. Finally, Hale rose.

“You’ll regret this,” he said. Then he left without saluting.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

That night, the lab alarms tripped.

Keene was first to arrive. The containment case stood open, its glass lid shattered. The fragment was gone.

For one dreadful moment she thought it had moved on its own. But the truth came quickly: the scatter of glass bore a path, leading out the lab door and into the hall.

Hale.

She found him in the hangar, already suited up, prepping the Scylla. The fragment was cradled against his chest in a heavy-duty sample pod. His face was pale, but his eyes burned.

“It belongs down there,” he told her, voice eerily calm. “You know it does. It’s not meant for the surface-and it isn't something the sea will let go of so easily.”

Keene tried to reason with him. She begged. But when Alvarez arrived, Hale only barked, “Either you’re with me, or you’ll get out of my way.”

Before they could stop him, the Scylla was in the water again.

Descending.

Carrying the fragment home.

**Part V: The Awakening** 

The Scylla sank into blackness, and Hale’s breath fogged the glass.

He should have been afraid. Seven thousand meters down was a death sentence if anything failed. But instead, he felt exhilarated — as though something vast and benevolent had turned its gaze upon him.

The pod lay strapped to the seat beside him. Through its tiny viewport, the fragment pulsed faintly, spirals writhing like living veins. Each twist of its surface whispered in his mind, guiding his hands on the controls.

He no longer thought of himself as a trespasser. He was a messenger. A servant.

Depth ticked down: 4,000… 5,000… 6,000 meters.

And then, through the forward viewport, the seafloor bloomed into view. Flat, endless. Silent.

Until the idol rose from it like a mountain.

The hollow eyes burned in his mind. The mouth yawned wide, waiting.

Hale smiled.

“I’ve brought it back,” he whispered. “I’ve brought it home.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

On the Argo Deep, the control room was packed. Every eye fixed on the monitors, where Hale’s descent streamed back in eerie clarity.

Keene’s nails dug into her palms. “Cut the feed. Recall him,” she ordered.

“We can’t,” Alvarez murmured, his face waxen. “He’s locked out the uplink. It’s one-way only.”

Static fuzzed across the speakers. Beneath it came Hale’s voice, soft but certain: ""It’s waiting for me. Can’t you hear it?""

Morrow cursed and slammed a fist against the console. “Idiot’s gonna kill himself.”

Keene shook her head slowly. “Not just himself.”

The sub drew closer to the idol. Its head filled the screen, stone mouth gaping like a cavern. The grooves along its surface shifted faintly under the floodlights, curling and uncurling in spirals. Nausea swept through her like a tide turning.

She forced herself to look away — but others didn’t. She saw Alvarez staring too long, lips moving as if mouthing the unseen script. A petty officer slumped to the floor, whispering nonsense syllables.

The influence was bleeding through the feed itself.

Keene lunged and snapped the monitors off.

Half the crew jolted awake, gasping like drowning men.

But the damage was done.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The idol’s face filled his viewport.

Closer now. Close enough that he could see details not visible before: the carvings were not grooves, but openings, thin slits from which the blackness seemed to breathe. Faint streams of silt poured outward, but against all logic they carried a rhythm, like exhalations.

The fragment pulsed harder in its pod, vibrations rattling the bolts. Hale unlatched it without hesitation. He cradled it in his hands, feeling its warmth seep through the gloves.

“Here,” he whispered. “Yours.”

The mouth loomed.

He guided the Scylla forward, toward the darkness inside.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Klaxons wailed across the ship.

“Pressure spike in the hangar!” someone shouted.

Keene ran, heart hammering. When she reached the bay, the water gauges screamed red. Tiny rivulets spilled from the seams.

Then the lights flickered, and she heard it — a hollow boom reverberating through the hull, like something vast and heavy shifting on the ocean floor.

The idol had moved.

It was not just stone.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Inside the mouth, the dark was not empty.

The walls glistened, slick as flesh, lined with spirals that throbbed like veins. His floodlights caught glimpses of movement — folds contracting, something vast inhaling.

The fragment in his arms dissolved like salt, sinking into the walls, absorbed.

The statue shuddered.

And then it opened its eyes.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The control room went dark.

Monitors filled with static, then a single image: two hollow eyes, burning through the feed as though looking straight into the Argo Deep.

All around her, crew collapsed screaming. Some clawed at their eyes. Others simply went still, whispering in voices not their own.

Keene clutched the console, forcing herself not to look, not to listen — but the sound seeped in anyway, a voice speaking in spirals, promising that the sea would take them all.

And beneath it came another sound, deeper, older:

The sound of something rising.

**Part VI: Reclaiming** 

The ship’s alarms screamed, metallic voices drowned beneath the roar of the sea. On the bridge, Keene clung to the console as the floor pitched under her boots. The sonar screens should have been a storm of lines and numbers, but instead they pulsed with eyes — hundreds, thousands, unblinking, layered one over another until the glass was nothing but white sclera and black pupils. They stared without depth, without mercy.

Alvarez swore and slammed a fist against the nearest panel, but it didn’t clear. He backed away until his shoulders hit the wall, his face bathed in the glow of the impossible screens.

“He’s inside it,” he whispered. His voice was child-thin. “Hale went inside.”

Keene shut her eyes, just for a second, but it didn’t help. The eyes were burned there, behind her lids.

The deck shuddered, not from waves but from something deeper — like the sea floor itself was shifting. Outside the bridge windows, black water bulged upward, glassy and wrong. Bubbles rose the size of houses. The ship listed, metal shrieking as if protesting.

“It’s coming up,” Keene said hoarsely. She pointed — and there it was.

The idol’s crown broke the surface first, jagged with barnacles. The carved eyes glowed faintly, the same unbearable light as on the screens. But the rest of it followed: shoulders broader than city blocks, arms half-buried in sediment. The sea poured off it in cataracts, thunder rolling as if a mountain had decided to rise.

The idol was not a statue.

Stone flexed. Runes ran like liquid, flowing in channels down its torso. The mouth yawned, the abyss behind Hale’s final descent gaping wide, and from within came a sound — not roar, not voice, but a rush of suction like the inhalation of a god.

The ship was dragged forward, pulled as if hooked. Consoles sparked. Men screamed on the decks below. Keene clutched the railing until her knuckles split.

The sea fractured around them, a funnel of water opening downward. Not to the trench they had mapped, but to something more ancient. A throat. An endless passage.

Alvarez broke first. He tore free of his frozen lean against the wall and bolted, his rasping cry vanishing into the corridor. Keene staggered after him, but stopped at the bridge’s threshold, staring down into the spiraling water.

“Do you see it?” She whispered, no one around to hear. “Christ, it’s not the bottom. It never had one.”

The idol bent lower. Its hand — carved but not rock, fingers thicker than the ship’s hull — reached out with impossible slowness. The ocean did not resist it. The sky dimmed as if sun and moon both were shamed into hiding.

The ship lurched. The idol’s hand closed.

For an instant Keene thought she saw Hale again, framed in the glow of the idol’s mouth, his silhouette waving like a shadow on a wall. Then the pressure crushed the bridge, glass shattered inward, and black water roared in.

She had no time to scream. Only the eyes filled her, one final time.

The sea swallowed the Argo Deep. When the waves stilled again, there was no sign it had ever existed.

The first time the anomaly appeared on sonar, no one thought much of it.



The Argo Deep was three weeks into its six-week survey of the Cascadia Abyssal Plain, and most of what they mapped was as monotonous as the desert — empty seafloor, gently undulating, with the occasional black smoker vent or jagged scar where tectonic plates had disagreed long before men learned to draw maps. The crew had grown used to staring at the same sets of blips and grids on the monitors. Sometimes they joked about it — how they were the most overeducated cartographers in the world, drawing the ocean’s bones one ping at a time.



But then the sonar technician, Alvarez, frowned.



It was a small thing. He had been half-asleep over the console, sipping his third cup of burnt coffee, when the sweep returned a cluster of reflections that didn’t belong.



“Dr. Keene,” he called over his shoulder. His voice carried easily in the quiet control room. “Can you take a look at this?”



Dr. Sarah Keene, chief oceanographer, leaned over. She had spent her career in deep-sea geology, her patience worn to diamond-hard tolerance by years of squinting at irregularities only to find out they were noise, or shadows, or boulders dropped from icebergs centuries ago. But Alvarez’s tone had a thread of unease in it, and she followed his gaze.



On the grid, a shape stood where nothing should. Rising from the flatness of the plain, almost vertical. Too smooth, too regular.



“Depth?” she asked.



“Just shy of seven thousand meters,” Alvarez said. His eyes flicked to her, the corners tight. “No trench nearby. No ridge.”



Keene studied the return. The object wasn’t massive by seafloor standards — maybe thirty meters high, if the readings weren’t distorted — but its angles bothered her. Not jagged like rock. Not amorphous like coral. Sharp. Deliberate.



“Probably an error,” she said at last, though even she didn’t believe it.



Still, she logged the coordinates.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



By morning, the anomaly had become the thing everyone whispered about.



The Argo Deep carried a mixed crew: scientists, engineers, submersible pilots, a skeleton staff of Navy observers whose funding had quietly greased the expedition. They’d seen enough oddities to know most mysteries shrank under scrutiny, but boredom was a powerful fuel for rumor.



At breakfast, the pilots speculated whether it might be a shipwreck. Alvarez swore it was too big. One of the Navy men suggested it could be Cold War debris; some long-forgotten satellite or weapons platform dumped into the black.



Keene said nothing. She only watched the numbers.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_





That evening, the captain gave her the go-ahead.



“Send one of the drones,” he said, folding his arms as if bracing for disappointment. “Clear it up before the crew gets carried away.”



Keene agreed. She wanted answers too.



The ROV — Heron II — was lowered after dark, its lights slicing into the churning surface before it vanished into the endless descent. Everyone crowded the control room to watch the feed.



Five hundred meters down, blue still lingered. At a thousand, the light turned to murk. At three thousand, black swallowed everything but the drone’s beams.



The deeper it went, the quieter the room grew.



At six thousand meters, Keene felt her throat tighten. The drone’s altimeter ticked closer to the seafloor. She leaned forward, waiting.



“Contact in one hundred meters,” Alvarez said softly.



The cameras cut through the dark, showing swirls of silt, slow-drifting pelagic creatures, an occasional pale fish darting from the beams.



Then the ground appeared. Flat, rippling, empty — until something vast loomed in the distance.



Not a rock. Not a wreck.



It rose from the plain, impossible in its symmetry. A column at first glance, but as the drone approached, the truth sharpened into focus:



A face.



A face larger than the submersible itself, carved in cold stone. The eyes were hollow, gaping. The mouth hung open in a silent scream, its proportions wrong — too wide, too long, not meant for a human skull.



The crew stared in silence.



“My God,” whispered Alvarez.



Keene’s pulse thundered in her ears. The camera tilted, revealing shoulders buried in silt, a torso half-swallowed by the plain. It wasn’t just a face. It was a statue.



And no one could explain how it had come to rest nearly seven kilometers beneath the waves.

  
  
  


**Part II: Descent**



The debate lasted less than twelve hours.



Captain Morrow wanted nothing to do with it. He had signed on to ferry scientists, not to flirt with the abyss. The Navy observers were split — one cautious, one eager to claim whatever prize lay waiting on the seafloor. Keene herself pressed hardest.



“We can’t leave it unexplored,” she argued in the wardroom, standing with her palms flat against the chart table. “If this is man-made, it’s the most significant archaeological discovery of the century. No civilization on record had the technology to build at that depth. It rewrites—”



“It kills,” Morrow interrupted. His voice was flat, graveled with too many years at sea. “If something goes wrong, there’s no rescue. Not at seven thousand meters.”



Keene met his gaze. Her heart beat hard, but she didn’t look away. “That’s why we have the Scylla. She was built for this. Titanium hull, full redundancy. If we don’t dive, someone else will, and they won’t have our equipment. Or our care.”



The room fell quiet.



Finally, Lieutenant Hale — the younger Navy man, all square jaw and ambition — leaned forward. “One dive. Minimal crew. Document the site. If it’s nothing, we’re done.”



Morrow muttered something under his breath, but he didn’t argue further.



And so, it was decided.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_





The Scylla waited in her cradle, gleaming under floodlights, a steel sphere built for three. Her viewports were narrow, her arms delicate, her body designed to withstand pressure that would crush most submarines to powder.



Keene would go. Alvarez, despite his nerves, volunteered to pilot — he trusted machines more than men. The third seat was filled by Lieutenant Hale, who refused to let the civilians dive without military oversight.



They launched at dawn. The sea was calm, the kind of surface stillness that always made Keene uneasy — as if the ocean, for once, was pretending to sleep.



The descent began smoothly. Numbers scrolled across the consoles, depth ticking steadily downward.



A thousand meters. The light drained away. Keene pressed her face to the viewport, watching jellyfish pulse like lanterns, their bodies ghost-pale in the dark.



Three thousand. Fish with unblinking eyes drifted past, silent as thoughts. The water grew thicker, blacker, a weight pressing from all sides.



Five thousand. Hale had stopped speaking, his earlier bravado stripped away by the immensity outside. Only Alvarez muttered occasionally, coaxing the sub, whispering like a priest at a shrine.



Six thousand, six hundred.



Keene’s breath fogged the glass. She was trying to steady her heartbeat when the seafloor appeared — an endless gray plain, dusted with silt, lifeless. And then, rising from it, the idol.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_





Up close, it dwarfed them.



The statue’s head alone was at least twice the size of the Scylla. Its features were almost human, but stretched and distorted, as though sculpted by someone who had only heard of mankind, never seen it. The eyes were vast pits. The nose was flattened, the mouth open wide enough for the submersible to glide into, if they dared.



“Christ,” Hale whispered.



Keene could barely hear him. Her own thoughts clamored, disbelieving. The material looked like stone, but smoother, darker, as if time and pressure had polished it. Carvings ran along the visible torso — spirals, notches, grooves that made no sense to the eye, as though written in an alphabet meant for something else entirely.



Alvarez angled the floodlights higher. The beams struck the hollow eyes, and for a moment it seemed as though the idol stared back.



Keene shuddered. She told herself it was only imagination, but the sensation lingered — an awareness pressing against her skin, as though something vast and waiting had noticed them.



“Get closer,” she said, her voice steadier than she felt.



Alvarez maneuvered the sub forward. The arms extended, brushing silt from the carvings. The grooves were deep, purposeful. Even after centuries, they had not eroded.



“Take samples,” Hale ordered, his tone clipped, as if speaking too loudly might wake it.



The manipulator scraped a fragment loose. The sound — a screech of metal against stone — reverberated through the hull. Keene winced. The shard clattered into the sample bin, dull and heavy.



Alvarez swore softly. “This isn’t natural,” he said. “It’s not basalt, not any formation I’ve seen.”



Keene leaned closer to the viewport, eyes drawn inexorably to the idol’s mouth. Inside the dark hollow, patterns glistened faintly. For a moment, she thought she saw movement — a ripple, a shiver deeper within.



“Pull back,” she whispered.



But Alvarez’s hands hesitated on the controls. His eyes were wide, glassy. Hale noticed and snapped, “I said pull back!”



The sub lurched as Alvarez obeyed, backing away from the idol’s face. Keene tore her gaze from the mouth, her skin crawling.



They ascended in silence.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_





Back aboard the Argo Deep, the crew swarmed them with questions. What had they seen? What was it made of? How could it exist?



Keene answered what she could, though each word felt inadequate. She kept her eyes on the fragment Alvarez had retrieved, now sealed in a container on the lab bench. It was heavier than it should be, almost metallic, its surface etched with spirals too fine to have been cut by ancient tools.



When she touched the glass, her fingers tingled.



That night, when she finally collapsed into her bunk, sleep did not come easily. And when it did, it brought her dreams of hollow eyes staring from the dark, and a voice whispering through fathoms of water — words she did not understand, but which seemed to understand her.

  
  
  


**Part III: The Idol**



The fragment sat sealed in its container, but no one wanted to be near it.



By protocol, Keene logged it, labeled it, and placed it in the ship’s geology lab. But even through the thick plexiglass of the sample case, the shard drew attention. Crew passing through the lab would glance at it and then look away quickly, as if they’d stared too long at a body on the roadside.



It was darker than stone should be — almost black, yet it caught the light strangely, as though it swallowed it and reflected it back in patterns too complex for the eye to follow. Fine etchings ran across its surface, spirals within spirals, lines that seemed to shift when Keene wasn’t looking directly at them.



By the second day, she noticed people avoiding the lab altogether.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_





That night, the dreams began.



Keene woke gasping, drenched in sweat, certain that water had been pouring into her cabin. She’d dreamed of corridors flooding, bulkheads groaning, the ship sinking with impossible speed. But what lingered most was the face. That vast, hollow-eyed face staring at her through the dream.



At breakfast, Alvarez looked haggard. “You too?” he asked quietly, when the others weren’t listening.



She nodded.



“I dreamt…” He trailed off, his hands tightening around his mug. “It was here. On the ship. Standing in the corridor. Too big to fit, but it was there. Watching.”



Before Keene could reply, Hale slid into the seat across from them. He hadn’t slept either — his uniform was rumpled, his eyes bloodshot.



“Whatever it is,” he muttered, “we should drop it back where it came from. Before it decides it wants more than dreams.”



Alvarez flinched. “You don’t think it’s—”



“I don’t know what it is,” Hale cut in sharply. “But I know I don’t want it here.”

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_





The lab equipment didn't disagree with him.



On the third day, Keene ran density tests on the fragment. The readings came back inconsistent — not impossible, but off enough that she reran them. The second set contradicted the first. So did the third. The numbers seemed to shift, as though the shard were changing under her instruments.



When she tried spectroscopy, the machine flickered, screens glitching before returning only static. Alvarez checked the circuits for her twice; nothing was wrong.



“Like it doesn’t want to be measured,” he said softly.



Keene didn’t reply, but she thought of the eyes. The way they had seemed to follow her, even in the crushing dark.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_





By the end of the week, the ship felt different.



Conversations stopped when Keene entered a room. People spoke in low voices, as if afraid of being overheard. Meals were quicker, laughter gone. Even Captain Morrow walked with shoulders hunched, as if weighed down by invisible chains.



Every night, the dreams grew worse. Some woke to the sound of knocking at their doors. Others swore they heard whispers in the ventilation shafts, words garbled but urgent. Hale startled awake one morning with his bunkmate shaking him, after he’d begun speaking in a language no one recognized.



And through it all, the fragment remained in its case, untouched. Waiting.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  


On the eighth day, Keene found Alvarez staring at the sample. He hadn’t noticed her enter. His face was pale, drawn, eyes fixed on the spirals that writhed faintly across the black surface.



“Alvarez,” she said carefully.



He blinked, as though surfacing from deep water. His lips parted. “It’s not carved.”



“What?”



He pointed. “The lines. They’re...not carved. They’re growing. Changing. Look—”



Keene leaned closer. Unease coiled in her chest. The grooves were not static; they shifted subtly, curling into new configurations, as though something alive inside the stone was pressing against the surface.



Revulsion tightened her throat. She backed away.



“Seal the lab,” she ordered.



But as she turned, she saw Hale standing in the doorway. He had heard everything.



And the look in his eyes told her what she feared most: he had already decided the only way to end this was to put the Scylla back in the water — and return the fragment to the idol’s waiting mouth.

  
  
  


**Part IV: Influence**



The Argo Deep had always been a quiet ship, but now the silence turned poisonous.



The crew avoided one another in the corridors. Meals were eaten quickly, in tense solitude, trays abandoned half-full. Even the hum of the engines seemed subdued, as if the ship itself had grown cautious, unwilling to draw attention.



Keene caught bits of conversations — whispers about the fragment, mutters about omens. One sailor crossed himself when she passed, muttering under his breath. Another asked outright if she had “brought it aboard on purpose.”



It was superstition, yes. But it was spreading.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



The dreams worsened.



Keene woke one night to find water trickling down her bunk wall. She sat up, heart hammering, and touched it. Dry. When she looked again, the rivulets were gone.



Alvarez stopped sleeping altogether. His hands shook, and his eyes darted constantly, as if searching for something just beyond the edge of vision. He confessed to her in a whisper that he’d begun hearing voices on the comm systems — static resolving into words, speaking in the same alien spirals etched into the fragment.



“It wants us back,” he said hoarsely. “It’s calling us.”



Keene wanted to dismiss it. But she had heard whispers too. Sometimes in the pipes, sometimes in the sea itself — the faint, distorted sound of someone calling her name from miles away.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



The first accident happened on the tenth day.



One of the junior engineers was found in the machine shop, standing stock-still with a length of steel gripped in both hands. When spoken to, he didn’t respond. His lips moved soundlessly, whispering patterns in the same cadence as Alvarez’s comms.



When Hale reached for him, the man swung the steel bar without hesitation. It took three others to restrain him. He clawed and screamed until they sedated him, shouting about “eyes in the dark” and “the mouth that waits.”



The crew quarantined him in the infirmary. After that, no one wanted to pass the lab, not even to fetch supplies. The fragment lay alone, but its influence seeped through bulkheads and rivets, filling the ship like ballast.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  


Two nights later, Keene woke to a faint sound in her cabin.



Knocking.



Three taps, slow and deliberate, on the inside of her porthole.



She froze, staring at the blackness outside the glass. No one, no...thing, should be able to reach it and yet — knock. Knock. Knock.



Her body moved before her mind did. She slammed the porthole cover shut and pressed her back against the wall, shaking until dawn.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



Captain Morrow convened an emergency meeting. His voice was brittle, his face hollow.



“This ends now,” he said. “We’re jettisoning the sample. Seal it in a container and drop it overboard.”



Keene felt a flash of relief — until she saw Hale’s expression. The lieutenant’s jaw was tight, his knuckles white.



“You can’t just throw it away,” he snapped. “That thing is worth more than this entire ship. We don’t destroy discoveries. We study them.”



“It’s not your decision,” Morrow shot back. “I’m master of this vessel. And I won’t let it sink under us.”



The two men glared at each other, silence thick as oil. Finally, Hale rose.



“You’ll regret this,” he said. Then he left without saluting.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



That night, the lab alarms tripped.



Keene was first to arrive. The containment case stood open, its glass lid shattered. The fragment was gone.



For one dreadful moment she thought it had moved on its own. But the truth came quickly: the scatter of glass bore a path, leading out the lab door and into the hall.



Hale.



She found him in the hangar, already suited up, prepping the Scylla. The fragment was cradled against his chest in a heavy-duty sample pod. His face was pale, but his eyes burned.



“It belongs down there,” he told her, voice eerily calm. “You know it does. It’s not meant for the surface-and it isn't something the sea will let go of so easily.”



Keene tried to reason with him. She begged. But when Alvarez arrived, Hale only barked, “Either you’re with me, or you’ll get out of my way.”



Before they could stop him, the Scylla was in the water again.



Descending.



Carrying the fragment home.

  
  


**Part V: The Awakening** 



The Scylla sank into blackness, and Hale’s breath fogged the glass.



He should have been afraid. Seven thousand meters down was a death sentence if anything failed. But instead, he felt exhilarated — as though something vast and benevolent had turned its gaze upon him.



The pod lay strapped to the seat beside him. Through its tiny viewport, the fragment pulsed faintly, spirals writhing like living veins. Each twist of its surface whispered in his mind, guiding his hands on the controls.



He no longer thought of himself as a trespasser. He was a messenger. A servant.



Depth ticked down: 4,000… 5,000… 6,000 meters.



And then, through the forward viewport, the seafloor bloomed into view. Flat, endless. Silent.



Until the idol rose from it like a mountain.



The hollow eyes burned in his mind. The mouth yawned wide, waiting.



Hale smiled.



“I’ve brought it back,” he whispered. “I’ve brought it home.”

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_





On the Argo Deep, the control room was packed. Every eye fixed on the monitors, where Hale’s descent streamed back in eerie clarity.



Keene’s nails dug into her palms. “Cut the feed. Recall him,” she ordered.



“We can’t,” Alvarez murmured, his face waxen. “He’s locked out the uplink. It’s one-way only.”



Static fuzzed across the speakers. Beneath it came Hale’s voice, soft but certain: ""It’s waiting for me. Can’t you hear it?""



Morrow cursed and slammed a fist against the console. “Idiot’s gonna kill himself.”



Keene shook her head slowly. “Not just himself.”



The sub drew closer to the idol. Its head filled the screen, stone mouth gaping like a cavern. The grooves along its surface shifted faintly under the floodlights, curling and uncurling in spirals. Nausea swept through her like a tide turning.

She forced herself to look away — but others didn’t. She saw Alvarez staring too long, lips moving as if mouthing the unseen script. A petty officer slumped to the floor, whispering nonsense syllables.



The influence was bleeding through the feed itself.



Keene lunged and snapped the monitors off.



Half the crew jolted awake, gasping like drowning men.



But the damage was done.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  


The idol’s face filled his viewport.



Closer now. Close enough that he could see details not visible before: the carvings were not grooves, but openings, thin slits from which the blackness seemed to breathe. Faint streams of silt poured outward, but against all logic they carried a rhythm, like exhalations.



The fragment pulsed harder in its pod, vibrations rattling the bolts. Hale unlatched it without hesitation. He cradled it in his hands, feeling its warmth seep through the gloves.



“Here,” he whispered. “Yours.”



The mouth loomed.



He guided the Scylla forward, toward the darkness inside.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_





Klaxons wailed across the ship.



“Pressure spike in the hangar!” someone shouted.



Keene ran, heart hammering. When she reached the bay, the water gauges screamed red. Tiny rivulets spilled from the seams.



Then the lights flickered, and she heard it — a hollow boom reverberating through the hull, like something vast and heavy shifting on the ocean floor.



The idol had moved.



It was not just stone.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_





Inside the mouth, the dark was not empty.



The walls glistened, slick as flesh, lined with spirals that throbbed like veins. His floodlights caught glimpses of movement — folds contracting, something vast inhaling.



The fragment in his arms dissolved like salt, sinking into the walls, absorbed.



The statue shuddered.



And then it opened its eyes.

  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_





The control room went dark.



Monitors filled with static, then a single image: two hollow eyes, burning through the feed as though looking straight into the Argo Deep.



All around her, crew collapsed screaming. Some clawed at their eyes. Others simply went still, whispering in voices not their own.



Keene clutched the console, forcing herself not to look, not to listen — but the sound seeped in anyway, a voice speaking in spirals, promising that the sea would take them all.



And beneath it came another sound, deeper, older:



The sound of something rising.

  
  
  


**Part VI: Reclaiming** 



The ship’s alarms screamed, metallic voices drowned beneath the roar of the sea. On the bridge, Keene clung to the console as the floor pitched under her boots. The sonar screens should have been a storm of lines and numbers, but instead they pulsed with eyes — hundreds, thousands, unblinking, layered one over another until the glass was nothing but white sclera and black pupils. They stared without depth, without mercy.



Alvarez swore and slammed a fist against the nearest panel, but it didn’t clear. He backed away until his shoulders hit the wall, his face bathed in the glow of the impossible screens.



“He’s inside it,” he whispered. His voice was child-thin. “Hale went inside.”



Keene shut her eyes, just for a second, but it didn’t help. The eyes were burned there, behind her lids.



The deck shuddered, not from waves but from something deeper — like the sea floor itself was shifting. Outside the bridge windows, black water bulged upward, glassy and wrong. Bubbles rose the size of houses. The ship listed, metal shrieking as if protesting.



“It’s coming up,” Keene said hoarsely. She pointed — and there it was.



The idol’s crown broke the surface first, jagged with barnacles. The carved eyes glowed faintly, the same unbearable light as on the screens. But the rest of it followed: shoulders broader than city blocks, arms half-buried in sediment. The sea poured off it in cataracts, thunder rolling as if a mountain had decided to rise.



The idol was not a statue.



Stone flexed. Runes ran like liquid, flowing in channels down its torso. The mouth yawned, the abyss behind Hale’s final descent gaping wide, and from within came a sound — not roar, not voice, but a rush of suction like the inhalation of a god.



The ship was dragged forward, pulled as if hooked. Consoles sparked. Men screamed on the decks below. Keene clutched the railing until her knuckles split.



The sea fractured around them, a funnel of water opening downward. Not to the trench they had mapped, but to something more ancient. A throat. An endless passage.



Alvarez broke first. He tore free of his frozen lean against the wall and bolted, his rasping cry vanishing into the corridor. Keene staggered after him, but stopped at the bridge’s threshold, staring down into the spiraling water.



“Do you see it?” She whispered, no one around to hear. “Christ, it’s not the bottom. It never had one.”



The idol bent lower. Its hand — carved but not rock, fingers thicker than the ship’s hull — reached out with impossible slowness. The ocean did not resist it. The sky dimmed as if sun and moon both were shamed into hiding.



The ship lurched. The idol’s hand closed.



For an instant Keene thought she saw Hale again, framed in the glow of the idol’s mouth, his silhouette waving like a shadow on a wall. Then the pressure crushed the bridge, glass shattered inward, and black water roared in.



She had no time to scream. Only the eyes filled her, one final time.



The sea swallowed the Argo Deep. When the waves stilled again, there was no sign it had ever existed. 



The abyss had reclaimed all.
