**Parse the Odds: A Statistical Car Wash for the Bears**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard numbers. The Detroit Lions enter this matchup as a 6-point favorite, with implied probabilities hovering around **55-57%** to win outright (based on decimal odds of 1.36-1.38). The Chicago Bears, meanwhile, are priced at **24-26%** to pull off an underdog miracle. The total points line sits at **46.5**, with nearly even money on Over/Under.

Here’s why the math matters:

* **Lions’ Offense vs. Bears’ Defense**: Detroit’s offense was a scoring machine last season (33.2 PPG), while Chicago’s defense was a sieve (354.2 YPG allowed). It’s like pitting a chainsaw against a stack of Jell-O.
* **Bears’ Offense vs. Lions’ Defense**: Chicago’s offense was the NFL’s worst (283.5 YPG), and Detroit’s defense was 7th (20.1 PPG allowed). This is a date for the Bears’ QB—expect a performance akin to a toddler trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube.

**Digest the News: Bears’ Updates Are as Exciting as a Tax Audit**  
Unfortunately, there’s no scandalous injury drama here. The Bears haven’t had a headline-worthy development since their QB’s pregame warmups (a 78% completion rate in 2024? Groundbreaking stuff). The Lions, however, are riding a wave of confidence after their explosive 2024 season. Their star running back, “Rocket” Rashaad (a man who once turned a 3rd-and-15 into a 78-yard touchdown), is fully healthy. Meanwhile, the Bears’ star receiver, “Slow Mo” Moore, averaged 6.2 yards per catch last year—roughly the speed of a sloth on a coffee break.

**Humorous Spin: Football as a Reality TV Show**  
The Bears’ offense is so anemic, they’d need a time machine to score against a high

Surely she has to be aware that I like her?,"Pretty much title. I've (27M) been packing my friend's (25F) lunch everyday for about a month now. We talked about dating once, but decided to focus on friendship as we both were in very hectic points of our life and really needed to repriotize (about 9 months ago). It's been a complicated time, and a lot has happened, but I really focused on just being friends. Then it seemed to me (and others) that she was flirting more with me and treating our friendship more in a relationship way (ie coming over when she wants, asking me to make coffee and matcha for her, making overtly sexual jokes to me, spending 20+ hours a week together). I'm not sure if either she is unaware of how she comes across and doesn't mean it, or if she is and does mean it. Either way, I have become reinvested in the idea of a relationship as I'm out of my hectic period of life and really enjoy the time I spend with her.

Recently, she has been going through a lot, so I offered to make her lunches for her. She was enthusiastic about it and pays me for ingredients and I give her her lunches for the week Sunday night (or sometimes I deliver them to her at work if our timing doesn't line up the best). I make her homemade meals that are delicious and healthy. I also try to make them look cute and even bought special tools to engage in a little kyaraben (Japanese practice of making lunches look cute).

This is all to say, surely she has to be aware that this is not just a normal friendship thing, and that I do this because I care about her a lot, right? And if she is aware and didn't want a relationship, she probably wouldn't be having me make her lunches, right? Ya the answer is just ""talk to her about this"", and I will, but she has an incredibly stressful deadline coming up soon, so I'd rather not add more stress onto it. I think it's much better to just continue to support her till she has finished the project she has.

I blindly bought perfumes from Blur India after reading glowing reviews. Originally a cosmetics brand, Blur has now ventured into perfumes with a refreshing approach. The playful and fun packaging instantly caught my eye—something often missing in the affordable, made-in-India perfume space. I picked three variants—Cookie Crumble, Vanilla Melts, and Cherry Tart—priced around ₹450 each.

Vanilla Melts is sweet with a musky base and lasts 6–7 hours. Inspired by Kayali Vanilla 28, it’s a lovely feminine fragrance.

Cookie Crumble opens with floral notes and settles into a soft vanilla accord, offering a unique and original scent perfect for daily wear.

Cherry Tart has a bold, seductive cherry scent with sweetness that makes it unforgettable.

These perfumes deliver excellent performance and value, making them a fantastic blind buy for affordable luxury!

**Blur India Perfume Review on Desi Fem Frag Subreddit**

I bought five perfumes from Blur India on a blind buy and was thoroughly impressed. The packaging, while affordable, looks charming and has a premium feel that sets it apart in this price range. The bottles are beautifully designed, and even the smallest details, like the decorative rings, add character and charm.

Cherry Tart offers a delightful cherry fragrance with just the right balance, making it both playful and elegant.

Vanilla Melts is a soft vanilla scent with subtle layers that evolve over time, adding depth and warmth.

Peach Sorbet presents a vibrant, fruity aroma that’s fresh and bright without being overpowering.

Coffee Cake and Cookie Crumble both offer comforting gourmand notes that are cozy and inviting.

With a performance that lingers gently and packaging that’s both cute and travel-friendly, this collection is a fantastic introduction to affordable Indian perfumes!

**Blur India Perfume Review on Brown Beauty Subreddit**

I recently picked up Blur India perfumes during a sale after reading positive reviews, and I’m glad I did! The packaging is adorable, and the perfumes are incredibly affordable. It’s exciting to see new Indian brands offering such well-crafted scents.

Cookie Crumble is a beautifully floral fragrance that settles into soft vanilla notes. It feels familiar yet unique and lasts well over six hours.

Vanilla Melts has quickly become my favorite vanilla fragrance. A brief period of maceration enhances its sweet opening and smooth musky finish. The fragrance matures beautifully and stays with me throughout the day.

Coffee Cake smells remarkably similar to Kamrah Qahwa, making it a perfect dupe for those seeking something familiar yet affordable.

These perfumes are a delightful find with travel-friendly bottles and a charming presentation—highly recommended for fragrance lovers!

**Blur India Perfume Review on Indian Beauty Yappers Subreddit**

Here’s my review of Blur India perfumes, and I couldn’t be happier! Since they’re very affordable, I chose scents that matched my vibe, knowing that they’d still be perfect even if I used them as room fresheners.

The bottles feel surprisingly heavy for the price, and the included charms add a playful touch. I tested Cookie Crumble and Vanilla Melts, and both exceeded my expectations.

Cookie Crumble is my favorite—it opens fresh with floral notes and blends seamlessly into a soft vanilla accord, lasting around seven hours without any sharpness.

Vanilla Melts is a subtle, less sweet vanilla inspired by Kayali Vanilla. It matures beautifully after a few weeks and gains depth with time, making it a sophisticated choice.

These perfumes are worth a blind buy for anyone searching for affordable yet elegant fragrances. Their customer service was impressive as well, quickly resolving a missing charm issue, which further boosted my experience!

**Blur India Perfume Review on Beauty Addiction Subreddit**

I recently did a blind buy of Blur India’s *Smells Like Breakfast In Bed* perfumes, and I’m thrilled with the results!

Vanilla Melts is a perfectly balanced gourmand fragrance—sweet but not overpowering—with woody and musky notes that enhance the vanilla. It lasts around 6–7 hours with a pleasant projection and eventually settles into a comforting hazelnut scent.

Cookie Crumble truly surprised me. It’s an original floral and vanilla blend that feels refreshing and unique, rather than duplicating other fragrances. It’s quickly become my favorite, offering elegance and warmth without being overly familiar.

These perfumes have a wonderful vibe, affordable pricing starting at ₹450, and a premium look and feel. I highly recommend blind buying *Cookie Crumble*—it’s a delightful addition to any fragrance collection and a standout in this price range!

Hoje trago uma recomendação (por enquanto) de chaleira elétrica ""pescoço de ganso"". Num geral, é um equipamento caro, e de longe é um componente do setup que não necessita tanto investimento.

Até alguns dias atrás, usava uma chaleira pescoço de ganso comum, aquela com o corpo ""nuvem"", mas sem termômetro na tampa. Entretanto, minha rotina começou a ficar meio apertada e tornou-se um incômodo usar termômetro pra verificar a temp. da água, além de certas inconsistencias. Com isso, conomizei uma grana e comecei a pesquisar.

Encontrei essa belezinha no [Mercado Livre](https://www.mercadolivre.com.br/chaleira-eletrica-pescoco-de-ganso-com-controle-temperatura-cafe-e-cha-derramados-controle-preciso-da-temperatura-temporizador-de-preparo-integrado-bofutsy/p/MLB53208673?pdp_filters=item_id:MLB5534921598).

Não encontrei review algum e acredito que a marca informada no anúncio é genérica. Então relutei um pouco e aguardei surgir ao menos uma avaliação no anúncio. Porteriormente, surgiram dois falando ser boa; resolvi arriscar.

# Primeiras impressões e construção

Para minha grata surpresa, a chaleira é muito bem construída e linda.

Corpo todo em aço inox. 304 (é o que diz no anúncio), com textura escovada por dentro. Cabo e base em plástico, até que bem acabados e de qualidade ok.

É possível remover o puxador com uma chave allen de 2,5 mm, caso facilite na limpeza ou até mesmo ajustar/apertar.

# Características gerais

Possui capacidade máxima de 800 ml, tensão nominal de 220 V, potência de 1500 W e o conector que vem é padrão EU. O pino é de 4,8 mm (ou grotescamente chamado de plugue de 20 A). Pensei em trocar o conector (cortar fora e substituir) ou até abrir a base, mas pela potência e continuidade de uso, peguei um bom adaptador (aqueles de plástico bem rígido). Acredito que a corrente a ser suportada e o perfil de uso (nada contínuo) garente certa segurança. Mas não é recomendado usar adaptadores para equipamentos que requerem correntes mais elevadas.

# Modos de operação e controles

Os controles disponíveis são bem legais: um chamado ""coffee"", que define a temperatura em 92°C, aquece e mantém aquecido nessa temperatura. O de ferver (que é autoexplicativo) também mantém a temperatura. Porém, um bom aviso é que, ao manter a temperatura de fervura, acontece de vazar água pela tampa por conta de borbulhamento. Cuidado extra para não ocorrer acidentes. Por fim, há os controles de aumentar e diminuir temperatura, com delta de 1°C. Todos os controles são touch.

https://preview.redd.it/d0264bgwslof1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eecabf7d7a49f8fc5c31a83ed53004d1c3901405

Ela também tem um modo standby e uma ""memória"". Ao ser desligada e ligada novamente, volta ao último estado definido. Então se a última coisa a ser feita foi ferver, irá ferver de novo.

# Desempenho

O tempo de ferver os 800 ml é de 5 minutos aproximadamente. O flow rate é entre 3 ml/s e 20 ml/s (aproximadamente, medi uma vez só rsrs), o que, pra mim, está bem legal.

# Preço

O valor atual (11/9/2025) é conforme a primeira imagem. Com alguns cupons do ML que aparecem, é possível pegar uns R$60,00 de desconto e chega em uns R$340,00. Eu tinha uns valores de cashback do Meli e acabei pagando R$320,00, o que achei bem competitivo. O valor das vendidas pela Terabyte estão por aí e, pelos vídeos e reviews disponíveis, achei essa ""Bofutsy"" bem melhor.

# Conclusão

Aqueles que procuram uma chaleira genérica para auxiliar ainda mais na rotina sem morrer um rim, acho bem válida. Claro, são poucos dias de uso, mas acredito que seja ótima mesmo. Se no futuro tiver problemas, postarei aqui.

I started on bupropion about 3 weeks ago. Almost immediately (a day) after I started, I got a mildly swollen throat, which I had checked out, and which cultured positive for strep. 

Of course, strep can linger and or hang out forever, so it's anyone's guess weather the swollen throat was really caused by strep.

The minor throat swelling has not stopped. Last week the doctor advised me to try riding it out, to see if the symptoms got better. Last few days I've been having some heart fluttering, went to the ER last night and confirmed no heart attack. 

Going back to see my GP on Monday. I suspect it's because I drink lots of coffee, and I've just been now reading that coffee can be enhanced by bupropion. 

That may also be affecting my blood pressure, as it has been elevated (155/80) for my last few readings at home.

In addition to that, there have been **other times when money was taken out in smaller amounts** — like **$100**, **$200**, or even **$800** — but right now I’m only counting the **$748 payments** to keep things simple and clear.

I want to say this: **I’ve felt this way for a while** — this isn’t just because I haven’t gotten a PC. That’s just one example. This is about feeling like I don’t have access to the things I need or want, even though there’s money that was specifically meant for me.

Sometimes I ask myself: **Do I think I’m entitled?** I don’t think so. I’m not asking for anything crazy — I just want to be treated fairly and feel like I matter. I don’t want to feel like my needs are ignored while others in the family get what they want more easily.

I’ve noticed my mom spends money on **gas, coffee, and clothes**, while I’ve been left waiting for basic things. My **older brother** seems to get what he asks for, and my **younger brother** gets new toys and clothes. Meanwhile, I’ve had to wait or be told no, even when it comes to things like a computer that could help with school or personal goals.

I want to make it clear that I **love both of my parents**, and I’m not trying to be ungrateful. I just want to have **some of the things I need or ask for**, and to feel like I’m being treated equally and with respect.

At this point, I’m wondering **who I can talk to about this** to make sure my inheritance and support money are being used the right way — maybe someone from **Social Services**, a **lawyer**, or a **guardian agency**.

Thank you for listening.

How about some of your favorite simple, practical well-being tips in life? Some of mine:

Mental related:

\- Reflection and meditation in the morning, releasing some possible emotional baggage, like worries/anxiety, and affirming to have an intentional life that day (in my case, in a spiritual way)

\- Mindful practice, to do one thing at a time, like mindful eating, e.g. not using a gadget at the same time. Just enjoying my meal, slowly chewing it (related to Se cognitive function?). Pardon me, even mindful ""pooping"", just sitting without using a gadget can become a place of reflection... It should be no problem for Ni users, no such thing as boredom in (kinda) doing nothing, if you know what I am talking about :)

\- Journaling, noting some of the day's insights, new ideas, and rough plans

\- Gratitude practice, to try to even notice small things to be grateful for (also Se related?). And try being grateful even in bad/unexpected times (spiritual principle related)

\- Related to my personal mental challenge, I sometimes nonsensically may get irritated. I frame it with the ""reversed"" golden rule: I don't want people to get irritated with what I do, so why should I get irritated with what others do?

Health-related:

\- Drink warm water in the morning around 1 hour before anything goes to the stomach, and before sleep

\- Drink a sugarless coffee at least one hour before/after a meal to avoid disturbing iron absorption. It's said that sugarless coffee has some good effects on health, not to mention refreshing brain focus. Drink it cold to avoid a sensitive stomach.

\- Brush teeth before sleep, in a unique way: using the left hand. It is stimulating our brain

I came home from the military to help take care of her since she ended up in a nursing home at 47 years old because she ended up having two strokes and ESRD. 

Earlier this year my mom kicked me out of the house after an argument. The issue was, she was using a Teflon pan that I bought and was using a metal fork to cook eggs that I bought in it. I told her she shouldn’t use metal on Teflon. She taught me this as a kid. As I’m talking, I hear scraping and I asked her why she keeps doing that and she repeatedly says “Because I’m hungry! Because I’m hungry”. I asked her why she couldn’t just listen and she said “I have to ask you 3 or 4 times to do something”. I told her “You only asked me once to take your clothes out the dryer” and she said “I thought you’d hear the notification”. I let her know because of how she constantly messages me random things, I have her muted and she told me that was messed up and that it was my time to go. So I left. I’m glad she kicked me out because I have no guilt about not coming back. She’s gross. She kept saying I didn’t want her to be there and blaming me for things I didn’t do like sitting her walker outside. Telling me she can’t even live in her own house because I put her wheelchair FLUSH against the foot of her bed and a mirror in her room.

Living with her was unbearable just like my childhood. Bringing random junk home. The closets, cabinets, and drawers are at full capacity and she brings more shit on top of that and I’m telling her to stop bringing things because I’m the one that organizes everything and idk how to fit things. It’s crazy she kicked me out when I paid bills, the coffee machine she used was mine, all the cleaning supplies were mine, and all the dishes were mine. I got tired of hearing my mom saying she takes care of herself and I do nothing. I cooked, cleaned, put her medicine together. It made me so mad when I cleaned the kitchen, she cooked, I cleaned so I could cook, then tells me to clean so she could cook. I told her I don’t like how I’m the only one cleaning. She said “so what, I clean up your mess”. My mom has been a hoarder my whole life and never cleaned unless a man was coming over. I hated when she would walk around naked too. 



After she kicked me out she clogged the toilet with toilet paper and over flooded it with shit water. I’m over smelling feces. I told her this would be the last time I help her because she knows better for sure. Prior to her kicking me out, she shit herself three times in bed knowing I bought a bunch of chux and disposable briefs and I asked her why she kept shitting herself. She got mad and said “I don’t know when it’s going to happen”. Meanwhile she took a laxative to help her constipation and the whole point of chux and briefs is for that reason… not knowing when it’s going to happen.

To sum it up… what made me start looking at my mom differently was when she said that I’m bad at communicating and I pulled up my texts to read off what she said to defend myself… she farted so bad. I didn’t hear it but I smelled it and it was so disgusting. I went off. I asked her why she didn’t do this to anyone else and if I deserve that disrespect and she said yes because I’m her daughter and it’s her house. I told her she had the nerve to part her lips and ask for anything. That shit was so potent and putrid I could taste it. I called her disgusting. She did this weird shit to me as a kid too. Farting something terrible and acting as if I’m supposed to just smell it. I’ve never experienced this with anyone else. Not even with my grandma.

She complained so much about my grandma being a bad mom because of her abandoning them and her drug problem. My mom never helped me with homework. She said the teacher spent all day teaching so why should she help but has the audacity to ask me for help multiple times. She never helped with homework but beat my ass when I failed. The school told her I may have ADHD and she never did anything about it. I was diagnosed as an adult.

My mom dragged me by my hair in front of all my classmates and one of their parents because I forgot to put my socks on in the car when I was in 1st grade. She beat me with a metal pole when I took my hair out of my bun in kindergarten when she told me not to. She beat me with a metal pole til it broke. Wire hangers til they broke. Extension cords. And a lot of her beatings were her punching me in my head repeatedly. I remember scooting lower and lower to escape the punches and she grabbed me by my hair and made me stand up because she didn’t wanna crouch lower to punch me in my head because my grades were bad. She’d threaten to kill me about my grades and say “a mother shouldn’t feel this way about her child”. Coming up to my school telling the staff she needs to watch me because my grades are bad. A classmate relayed this to me. 

Since two incidents happened at school, my mom punching me in the head repeatedly in front of the rest of my family over a disagreement about my shoes, and to this day antagonizing me trying to start shit with me in front of company made me realize my mom liked to embarrass me.

I’m too embarrassed to say everything. 

Yesterday she said something like “you’re annoyed with my smacking but not the sounds of the fans”. And I said “yes, plus there’s an odor in here”. She brought one when I was a kid she would smack her lips and I would look at her like she wasn’t supposed to.

That made me realize my whole life my mom was aware of how much smacking annoyed me and didn’t care. That makes it intentional, right? Because as a kid I told my dad that it bothered me. He told me to let her know respectfully and how i should say it and she got mad. And I told her this yesterday. She said “I’m sure I did get mad” “I’ve been smacking before you were born”. My mom would randomly smack near me. Not constantly but enough for me to notice and she wouldn’t be eating anything. She would do it in my ear while doing my hair. She was smacking in my ear while eating. One time I did tell her that smacking annoyed me because I was on the  phone with my cousin and she came in smacking on gum and so I hung up and sat quietly. She kept pestering me about what was wrong. I didn’t wanna say. She wouldn’t leave me alone and I said the smacking bothered me and she made me give her my phone. Another situation happened where she was eating soup and smacking and asking me what was wrong and I made up a lie and she was like “hmm that has you upset like that?”

I wanted to shave my legs because I got bullied for being hairy. She told me that I couldn’t but then I found out that she helped my cousin how to do hair removal and I’m like wow she never taught me that and when I confronted her, she’s all like oh well I didn’t do hair removal until I got grown. She volunteered at my school, but never helped me with my homework. She would tell me I wish I had a mother like me so I was so confused on why I hated my life as a child and I was contemplating suicide. She says she thought she was a good mom. I don’t see how when I wrote in my diary that I hated her, and she violated my privacy by reading it in front of me, but she never even questioned why I hated her. She’d complain that I stopped crying during my beatings and have my dad come over to discipline me like “I’d make you cry”. That’s the goal? ATP it’s not discipline, it’s torture. She beat me on a regular basis. That’s why I’m not crying bc I’m used to it?


This is a lot but this isn’t even all of it.


Am I trippin or this bitch been torturing me my whole life and letting me know that  only her comfort matters and I’m not allowed comfort? I couldn’t even pick my own career. I joined the military because she tried to force me into nursing school, and even then she picked the branch. I’m in my 20s and just now waking up. I wanna ghost her, but I don’t know.

So I was told in august that this staffing lead who had interviewed me for a previous role which I didn’t get wants to get coffee or lunch with me sometime in September. Then I get a call from the regional staffing manager that they want to get coffee or lunch to discuss contracts. 

I figure they’ll be discussing job terms since the staffing lead said earlier they want to bring me on.  

I get to the shop and we order coffee and then we walk around this market and this antique store like we’re sight seeing, and there’s no mention of a job offer or preferences or my skill set or experience- like what is even going on? 
Then we get lunch and still no discussion, they’re just talking to me about sports, my interests, the local area, pets etc. keep in mind I barely know these people other than for two teams interviews.

Over the lunch there’s still no discussion of anything related to a job except that they tell me they have a proposal they’re working on in one city and then it ends and they say we will keep in touch. So it was an hour and 15 minutes social outing for no reason. I presumed they would bring up a position they’re considering me for or where they’d want me in the company but no.

I am disappointed. I thought this would end in an offer after searching for seven months. This company has led me on since mid July. I just am tired of this job search and honestly done. ",1,1757626841.0,jobs,1,1.0,False
1nelf5r,https://i.redd.it/kp8v7s6dslof1.jpeg,This is the only time I'll save scum (SI needs to fix this feature),"Some context:

I have a Schalke save where, after years of building, we're finally in a position to win a league title and even a Europa League championship (Currently 1st in the Bundesliga going into March, and finished 2nd in the EL table on GD and are in the Ro16).

During the offseason, I bought this regen centerback named Jakub Holub, who has high potential. Midseason, he started whining about minutes. Unfortunately, these minutes have been limited because one of my centerbacks is straight up ***ELITE,*** and the other is a ball-playing defender, a role Holub isn't suited for. Therefore, it's been hard to get him significant minutes.

Anyway, he's been bitching for two months, which is cool. Now, I have team leaders coming up to me, talking about how he should either be playing or that I should just wave a magic wand to solve the issue. And, I'm sorry, but I call bullshit. We are not talking about an irreplaceable, world class defender. We're talking about a 19-year-old who is unproven and would either be replacing our best defender or playing a role in which he would fail. Especially when the player in question has only been at the club for a cup of coffee.

In real life, the leaders of a team wouldn't be bending space and time to accommodate this little shit, especially midway through what would be a monumental moment for the club. Yeah, they might say something along the lines of ""This lad is really fucking annoying, so maybe throw him a bone,"" but threatening a whole revolt is just... yeah, no.

I generally think FM is a quality game and one of the few sports titles I can get completely immersed and lost in. But the team atmosphere/dynamics functions are incredibly broken. And whenever these kinds of things pop up, I save scum the fuck out of them, because of how ridiculous they are.

Obviously, not every player/team interaction is bad. But these situations in particular just pull me right out of it.

I am going to therapy since I am 15 and he forbid me and my siblings to talk about it to anyone. I dont know what to do.

Mostly interested in a dye natural using less water for washing hair after application.

Seems like alot of water is being used after application of the dye - now am using henna, my hair is shoulder length.

Under cabinet led light - yellow)

Recessed down lights - red. I note that where we removed the wall that was in the kitchen their is a beam running across the room which is why I put a light in front of the cupboard next to the oven.

Track lights above sink - green (or could just put another recessed down light?)

Recessed light above coffee nook (purple, on a seperate switch)

Possibly a pendant light in the centre of the kitchen? May also see if I can get led strip lighing in the pantry cupboards as well.

Ever feel like you're playing life on 'hard mode' but forgot to grab the instruction manual? You're putting in the work, but the progress bars for happiness and success just aren't moving the way you want them to.

I've been deep in that feeling. But lately, I’ve started treating my daily life less like a grind and more like a game I can actually win. It's all about finding those little 'cheat codes' that give you an edge.

Here are a few that have genuinely stuck with me:

*   **The ""First & Last"" Hour Rule.** My phone used to be the first thing I saw in the morning and the last thing at night. Total recipe for anxiety. Now, the first hour of my day is for **me** (stretching, coffee, silence) and the last hour is for winding down (reading, journaling, talking with my partner). It's like putting up a firewall for your brain.

*   **The ""Energy Audit.""** Instead of a to-do list based on what's 'urgent,' I started organizing it by energy level. High-energy morning? That's when I tackle the big, creative problem. Post-lunch slump? Perfect for clearing out easy emails. You stop fighting your natural rhythm and start using it to your advantage.

*   **The ""Evidence Log.""** This one is huge for motivation. Keep a simple note on your phone or in a journal. Every time you do something—*anything*—that moves you toward a goal, write it down. Finished a workout? Log it. Read 10 pages? Log it. When you feel like you're getting nowhere, you have a literal log file of your own progress to prove yourself wrong.

Of course, sometimes the issue isn't the *routine*, but the emotional baggage we're carrying *into* the routine. All the life hacks in the world can feel like putting a band-aid on a deeper problem if you're struggling with burnout, self-doubt, or just feeling fundamentally stuck. When simple tweaks aren't enough, getting a structured plan to work through those emotional blocks can be the real level-up. For anyone feeling that, I found **this resource (affiliate link)** to be incredibly helpful for that kind of deeper, guided support.

Ultimately, it’s all about finding the small upgrades that work for your unique 'character build.' These tiny, consistent changes really do stack up.

So, what's one simple hack that's genuinely improved your day-to-day? Let's build a master list in the comments. 👇",1,1757626381.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1nel9mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1nel9mx/shift_your_identity_to_manifest_what_you_want/,SHIFT your IDENTITY to Manifest What You Want,"**EVERYTHING ABOUT MANIFESTATION CHANGED WHEN I DISCOVERED THIS!!!**  
  
Many of you will fall into a pattern of searching for success stories from others who have manifested what you want. Then you'll try to follow what they did to get it for yourself. You'll come across countless techniques such as visualizing, scripting, affirming, water method, 555 method, mirror work, SATS, etc. and feel overwhelmed. Then you'll ask, which one works? Which one is the best one? What did it feel like when you did it? How long did it take you to get your manifestation after doing it?

Then you will start doing these techniques, maybe you even get some results. But for some reason, it doesn't work consistently, or only works for ""small"" manifestations like a parking spot or free cup of coffee. (Otherwise, you wouldn't still be here searching and reading for solutions)

You get STUCK in a cycle, you look for the next technique, you'll find the next person who got their thing, and ask what they did, and try that. But you still don't get what you want, and you repeat this over and over and over again, sometimes for years. I know, I've been there, I used to be you.

The truth is, you're ALWAYS manifesting, your ENTIRE LIFE is a manifestation. It's just that most people are unconsciously manifesting.

So when we say manifestation, what we really mean is **CONSCIOUS MANIFESTATION**.

**It's not the technique, it's your IDENTITY or STATE OF BEING. Who you are being.** Because we are ALWAYS occupying a particular state of being, that's why we are ALWAYS manifesting.

**So how do you consciously manifest?** By embodying the state of already having your desires. **BECOME THE VERSION OF YOU** who is already living your life experiencing it.

**The KEY IS YOU and YOUR RELATIONSHIP to the ""MANIFESTATION"".**

**The focus is to be in that END STATE.** To get there, all you need to do is DECIDE that that's who you are now, but that's not enough for some people, especially those newer on this conscious manifestation journey. And THAT is where techniques can help. But as mentioned above, it isn't the technique itself, but your belief in the technique working, that gets you in the END STATE that powers the ""manifestation"".

We are all unique individuals, our brains don't operate the exact same way. So it makes sense why people get inconsistent results from following what other people did to achieve their success. Remember, it's not about DOING, it's about BEING. And you've got to find YOUR OWN WAY into it.

**What does this mean practically?**

Let me illustrate it for you using the following example: You want to manifest a car.  
  
Where do you put your focus? Hint: It's not the car itself.

The answer is... on yourself being a CAR OWNER.

Let's say you use ""imagination"" as a technique to manifest, and you visualize all the bells and whistles of your fancy car, the make the model, the color, the features, etc. That's all fine and good. But WHO ARE YOU BEING in relation to the car?

YOU BEING the CAR OWNER. Most people miss this point, they focus so much on the object of their desire so much, that they forget about their IDENTITY in relation to that object.

How would you THINK about yourself or FEEL, what would you ASSUME, how would you PERCEIVE the world through the lens of you BEING THE CAR OWNER of this fancy car you desire? **THIS is the STATE to embody. If you choose to use techniques such as imagination, or scripting to get you into this state, go for it, but YOURSELF is where your awareness has to go.**

No matter what technique you use, the focus is on your IDENTITY. Your secret power? Consciousness. Awareness. I AM. The ability to CHOOSE whichever identity you desire to embody.

Apply this principle to any and all of your manifestations, and watch it unfold, seemingly miraculously, but in absolute perfection before your eyes.

Happy Manifesting!!!

I’m wondering if there are any other **mature or returning students** out there, people who’ve come back to school later in life, are switching careers, navigating big life transitions, or just don’t quite vibe with the usual undergrad crowd. 

It seems like there aren’t many (or any?) groups on campus that cater to this specific student experience (+40), and it can feel a bit isolating at times. Also, it would be kind of awkward hanging out with my kids' friends at campus parties. I’d love to put together a **casual coffee meetup on campus,** something super low-pressure, to connect, share stories, and maybe build a bit of a network or community with people in a similar stage of life.

- Ongoing risks from commodity prices, pension funding, and customer concentration warrant monitoring.
- Restructuring and optimization measures may eventually yield results, but near-term profitability remains challenged.

Some background: I am a university student doing online classes, so I will need access to the internet. I am from Michigan and fluent in English and Korean, and I will start to learn Japanese if I finalize my decision to stay there.

If I am to stay in Japan, I will fly to South Korea to visit my family for a few weeks. I am unsure of when this will be.

Some things I’m looking for:
- Ideally somewhere warm, but this is not important if many of my other preferences can be met as long as it’s not brutally cold. I want to escape Michigan winter!
- Access to nature. This is a non-negotiable for me. Mountains, beaches, trails, etc. I love cities and I would be perfectly fine in say, Tokyo, if it would be easy/cheap to go on hikes on the weekends.
- Relatively cheap. I am financially independent and have no support from my parents. I am willing to spend money to explore the world, but am doing so on a budget.
- Good coffee scene. Third-wave/specialty coffee is very important to me and I like trying new cafes.
- Good public transport, walkable.
- Good food/gastronomy and access to local, fresh produce!
- Nightlife is not too important to me but I would like to perhaps make friends around my age (undergrad) and it would be fun to live the life of a student in a city

Specific questions:
1. When is the best time to go? My semester is from mid-January to the end of April. I am thinking of staying in February and March, and spending the last two weeks of March in Korea. I am definitely open to alternative suggestions from people who know what it’s like to live in Japan!
2. Where to stay?? This is the most important question. Even after lots of research, I am unsure because there are so so many options. Kobe, Gifu, Okinawa, or Tokyo are some areas I am looking at.

 I really would appreciate any sort of advice at all, as it would be my first time living in a foreign country with no family or friends. Thank you!!",0,1757625742.0,digitalnomad,3,0.5,False

Anyway I have tried every tactic under the sun to lose weight. Nothing budges.

Recently I began progesterone only birth control and cut out cream in my coffee (I drink a lot of coffee so I was probably having 200-300 calories cream a day). I went to the doctor today and I'm down to 154 in two months. That's great for me given I was gaining weight even while dieting before. 

I just wanted to share because at 42 I had begun to think my body was broken. Still higher than I'd like but thinking its a combo of better hormone balance and the elimination of half and half.  ",26,1757625681.0,Perimenopause,3,0.93,False

We're considering the LA area (Malibu, Brentwood, WeHo maybe??), Santa Barbara/Montecito area & Newport/Laguna area. Our housing budget is around $2M.

Palm Beach is essentially an 8 mile bubble with walks, beaches, coffee shops, resorts, private golf + social clubs, restaurants and great shopping for such a small area. It feels like a tropical Upper East Side of NYC.

Our daily routine in FL is some mix up of:

Going out to coffee - every morning, non-negotiable

Horseback riding in Wellington (we do the jumpers if anyone has farm recommendations)

Golfing & playing tennis at our club

Going out to eat on weekends

We eat super clean and also hit up the occasional pilates or yoga class. We're generally in bed by 10pm and don't value any party scene/going out out. We don't have kids yet but would like to within the next 4 years or so. It would be great to be in an area with young families where it is easy to meet people. Walkability is nice but not a must. We're fine driving 5-10 minutes into town for our coffee and errands. Safety is a big priority. Not to sound like a dick but we haven't seen a homeless person in like 3 years it...doesn't exist on Palm Beach Island and being around unpredictable drugged out people puts us on edge.

I feel embarrassed posting this because I'm aware of our \~privilege\~ but since we're originally East Coast people we know literally nobody on the West Coast and have nobody in real life to ask.

So, I started cleaning up my life. I threw away about 80% of my possessions. Got all the paperwork in order. Wrote notes. Got all of my remaining personal stuff put into boxes for whoever of my family would care. I was ready.

Today was the day. There is a reason for today, but I don't want acknowledgement of that. I had her ashes with me overnight and talked to her this morning in bed. I felt that I wasn't sure what to do and that if I wasn't completely sure I should just wait. But the longer I laid there the more it just made sense to go today.

I got up. Put her ashes with her brothers and sisters ashes in a box. I went for a walk. Took a shower and put on clean clothes for the first time in weeks. I put their pictures on the coffee table. I recorded a goodbye video and put the phone away for the authorities. And then I just sat and talked to my 6 dogs. Not having them with me is horrible. They were all that ever made my life better. But in talking to them for a while I got hungry. Being close to lunch I decided I'd better do that before ending it. But then just kept having small reasons after small reasons to go another few minutes or another hour.

Now it's almost dinner time and I'm still fucking here. I still don't want to be here and I feel like a failure and a further disappointment for still being here. I texted a friend to get coffee tomorrow. I guess I'll take it day by day. But I still have so much pain. Not just losing my dog(s) but life. And life is getting worse for most people, me included.

# ⚡ 3 fast example prompts you can use today

**1) Landing page rewrite (marketing)**

* **Role/Tone:** Senior conversion copywriter; clear, punchy, benefit-led.
* **Task:** Rewrite my SaaS hero section for clarity + conversions.
* **Background:** Product = “Workverse.AI” (replaces expensive SaaS with AI agents at 90% lower cost). Audience = SMB owners.
* **Rules:** Must include social proof placeholder, 1 CTA, ≤60 words above the fold. No jargon.
* **Immediate request:** Give 2 variants + a 3-bullet rationale each.
* **Format:** Markdown with H1, subhead, 3 bullets, CTA button label.

**2) Research summary (decision support)**

* **Role/Tone:** Analyst; neutral, source-first.
* **Task:** Summarize the 3 attached articles into a single brief my team can act on.
* **Rules:** Cite article names; call out contradictions; end with “What we should do next (3 bullets).”
* **Process:** Outline → merge → contradictions → actions.
* **Format:** Table (Key claim | Source | Confidence | Implication).

**3) Bug triage (ops)**

* **Role/Tone:** Staff engineer; crisp and pragmatic.
* **Task:** Categorize these 15 bug reports.
* **Rules:** Severity mapping P0–P3; ownership by component; SLA notes.
* **Immediate request:** Return a CSV block we can paste into Jira.
* **Format:** `id, title, component, severity, owner, first_fix_step`.

# ✅ Pro tips that matter

* **Paste the raw source** (briefs, transcripts, data). Models do best with concrete context.
* **Write “Must/May/Must-Not”** rules to force tradeoffs.
* **Set a quality bar** (“good/great/outstanding criteria”)—the model will aim higher.
* **Ask for a** ***brief*** **rationale + assumptions**, not a long “show your work.” Saves tokens, keeps focus.
* **Timebox and length-cap** everything. Vague scope = vague output.

# ❌ Common mistakes (and fixes)

* “Be creative and help” → **What outcome? For whom? By when?**
* Format drift → **Specify schema/table and fields.**
* Hallucinated facts → **Provide sources + say ‘If unsure, ask a clarifying question first.’**
* Endless loops → **Process section with 1 pass + self-check, then stop.**

Hi everyone, sorry for the mistakes, english is not my native language. I find myself in a very difficult situation, i’m heartbroken and i need to understand some things about my break up in order to move on.

I was in a relationship for 6 months with a guy named S. S was my third serious relationship. He’s a bit older than me. We’ve met in a public speaking contest (i don’t know how to say it in english), i was part of the staff team the year he won. The last twi summers , he sent me a dm asking for a coffee : first summer i was taken, second one was good, i was single, and i accepted. It was one of the best date i’ve ever went of my life.
Since that date, we’ve never stopped talking. But he was fresh out of a complicated relationship of 8 months with his ex, and didn’t want to commit.

We were on a 6 months situationship, both seing other peoples, but i was sure my time with him was coming soon. And i was right : after 6 months of waiting, the night i won the same exact public speaking contest he won 4 years ago, he asked me to be his gf. 

During our situationship, he moved to another city. So, it means bieng now in a long distance realationship. 
It was the best 6 months of my life. Truly out of a movie. S was caring, loving, surprising me with flowers, very sweet, always sharing some parts of his day when we were long distance, always paying for dates… he even bought me a piano for my birthday?? 

And i was with him, the best gf in the world : making him fried eggs in the morning, writting him letters, complimenting him every day, and making sure he was having fun with me every time. I didn’t want to be boring, and i’m sure i wasn’t : he seemed so happy with me, almost like a child. (Sex was also so fucking great, we were each other top 1)

I was aware of his avoidant attachment style. I was avoidant by the past, but very secure with him, very understanding of his fears and desires of freedom. I’ve always said to him that i was happy to be with someone that wasn’t dependant of me. 
But i was pushing him to give the best of him : he wanted to return to uni to get his diploma and become a lawyer. I helped him (i wanna say « I did absolutely everything for his admission») enter the best law school in our country, i was doing his cleaning task in his appartment when he was working hard every night to get money to return to uni….

Never argued, always discussed our disagreements. 

Last week. He sat me down at a restaurant. Said that he wanted to leave me. That it was over beetween us bc he couldn’t commit to me. That loneliness was calling him since the beginin. That he didn’t want to leave me but was obligated. Didn’t want to be happy in order to evoluate and find himself.
When i asked him if he loves me (we haven’t said ily yet) he said : « i don’t think so. I don’t think i’ve ever been in love in my life. Even if I said ily to my exes, it was bc i was young and it’s easier to say it back than to say it first ». He also said that he had strong feelings for me, even stronger than for his ex, but it wasn’t enough to shut the voices calling him back to being alone. So he wasn’t sure it was Love, bc he always wanted to be alone. He always said he wanted to see other women, not bc i wasn’t enough for him, but bc it was the symptom of his loneliness desire calling him.

Couples of days later, we’ve seen each other to discuss. He seemed so sad, heartbroken, but said he was less sad than me and even a bit relived to left me. We spent my last night in his city together, we’ve slept together. He said that he knows he wouldn’t find better than me, and that he felt a great loss letting me go. He also said he wanted to see a therapist bc he knows he’s leaving me also bc of his trauma and avoidance cycle

Before leaving, i sprayed my perfume everywhere. I left him a couple of bunny-drawing i’ve made, and hidden them in his flat (he absolutely loves Bunny) I also wrote him a fucking 200 pages book about our relationship (very well written, and i know it’s a power move bc he always admired my writting skills) that i left him on his bed. We didn’t end on good terms tho , bc i’ve learned he kissed a girl in a bar 2 days after breaking up with me.

Since my departure, he unfollowed me on insta but kept me on tiktok and still liking reposts. We’re now in no contact. And it hurts.

I know i need to forget him and move on, don’t need anybody saying me this, i’m very aware. 
I want to know. If he’s gonna regret. If he was in love with me, but the only one who didn’t know it. If he’s gonna come back one day. I don’t want to be forgettable, the perfect girl he wasn’t in love with, just a couple of great great qualities…

I’d be up for hanging out anywhere from Niagara to even Toronto since I’m traveling there as well. 

I’d be up for going out to eat, grabbing bbt or coffee/tea, outdoor activities like parks (especially since it’ll be so nice out), going to a museum or even more touristy stuff like around Clifton Hill. If we vibe well together then it won’t really matter what we do, we’ll have a good time. 

A little about me, I’m pretty easy-going and not too judgmental. I enjoy listening to music, playing guitar, piano, ice hockey, videogames, going for hikes and having deep discussions on a variety of topics ranging from astronomy, philosophy, or just current events and pop culture. Surprisingly, I’m fairly sane and I always joke that I am a solid reddit 8/10.

1nekp7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wafflehouse/comments/1nekp7t/district_manager_support/,District manager support?,"I’m a new unit manager (not new to running restaurants). Been in my store about 2 months. 

I inherited a store with major staffing issues (I’m aware that’s true with everyone). The “three weeks of schedules” I arrived to was an absolute fabrication filled with names of employees who had quit or were on vacation, so from day one I’ve been scrambling to find coverage. Right away had to fire a third shift GO for violence, one GO walked out during Labor Day weekend, another GO quit without notice and came back (I wasn’t allowed to fire him) and then quit again without notice a month later. I have had FOUR employees go out on several week absences due to major medical issues/hospitalizations. I had another SP quit when her second shift theft operation got foiled by ticket controls. 

 The whole staff was mostly unmanaged for months and had gotten used to the idea that schedules were mere suggestions and could be disregarded without consequence. I had a third shift employee who requested off nine days in a month to coincide with a child’s sport schedule and refused to commit to showing up on the remaining days I scheduled her (called out 4 times refusing to work because of ball games—and I wasn’t allowed to fire her.)

 It’s been a nightmare.

During this whole time I’ve been hiring and training (trained 3 GO and 3 SPs and have hired 3 more starting next week) and managing coverage issues almost entirely without support. My District has done literally zero to help (in fact I have been the one to help HER with coverage multiple times). If someone calls out on my days off she just takes the violation and makes no effort to get coverage, and ignores calls from my employees (who then call me for help). 

Now all of the sudden the big bosses have noticed my store has a ton of overtime each week. I’m getting chewed out and being asked to explain myself and I’m like…my district has been fully aware. She knows I’ve been over here by myself spending hours and hours and hours a week rearranging and rearranging schedules, begging my people to pick up shifts, working doubles myself, posting coverage requests in the division chat group (rarely any response), interviewing everyone who comes in the door to apply, etc. I’m doing everything I possibly can, and I’m getting nothing but criticism because I inherited a staffing clusterbuck.

yesterday I got a text from her telling me to “revise schedules to remove all OT.” And I….kind of want to murder her, because every time
Someone quits or goes in the hospital she also texts me saying, “why are there holes in your schedule? You can’t leave holes in your schedule.” So I ask for help, and none comes, and I fill the holes in with my own people. The briefest look at my schedule and employee roster—even the most cursory glance—would fully satisfy any question as to why there is overtime.

 The Division has stepped in and started offering to send me help, but at the cost of first me having to get chewed out for what I guess is my perceived “mismanagement.” I guess they think I’m just….intentionally being an idiot in scheduling all this overtime? 

I really want to know: is ny District supposed to be helping me with this stuff? Or at least communicating upline what’s going on? When I’m trying to train 3 grill operators at once (so exhausting),  is it a reasonable request that maybe them be trained by HER or sent to another store to train? 
Because I thought it was reasonable ask and was told “we’ll figure it out” and …nothing happened. 

I’m just pretty salty about working 80 hour weeks (my District is home every day by 3) and getting nothing but yelled at for what feels like Herculean efforts to get my store turned around (we’ve been increasing sales and rising in the comparison each week).

There are a number of issues with my District (my safe is ALWAYS short when she’s been in it. My commissary is ALWAYS over or under when she’s been in it. She fails to communicate upline directives until the very last minute. She never knows the answers to any question I ask, but just makes up stuff, which then I get chewed out for later when it was wrong. She advises me to fudge the numbers to cover commissary errors—usually caused by her.  She makes payroll errors any time she covers my Monday and closes payroll—in 2 OPs I’ve done 6 payroll corrections because of her —no, she doesn’t offer to correct her errors, that’s all on me.). She couldn’t  even be bothered to help me find bacon, cheese, or coffee when she failed to order it in my truck while I was on vacation. 

Seriously, yall. I came back from vacation with no bacon, cheese, or coffee—aand she didn’t lift a finger to help.

Is this normal for a district manager role? Because this is just…not sustainable for me.

I love running restaurants and I love Waffle House. But I’m getting too old to run my body like this, annd I have too much respect for my skills anms intelligence to be treated like I’m an idiot when I’m just trying to manage an impossible situation. 

So far what’s keeping me here is the fantasy of getting things under control enough so that I can be free of any need of support from my District.

1neko8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1neko8h/33_m4f_online_confidence_boosting_friends/,33 [m4f] - #Online Confidence Boosting Friends,"Hey all, 

Trying to figure out relationships in this season of life. Growing up, my social circle was wide but not deep, and now I’ve found myself with basically zero close friends. I’d love to change that.

What I’m looking for is pretty simple: an emotionally available real human being to talk to. Ideally 28-48 but if you feel you really gel with what I am saying I encourage you to reach out anyway!



Details come in the DMs, but I am emotionally.. frustrated. What I need most is a pocket confidence booster. But not for nothing! I want to be available to someone and their issues too. By the friends and family I have I am told my greatest quality is my wisdom - let me help you think and talk about that tough thing you are going through!

I know I need the relief of a place to be me, fully. Maybe you do to?



Interests-wise, I’m into music (especially metal/punk/hardcore) concerts, reading (huge Brandon Sanderson fan, also love Tolkien and Pierce Brown). I used to be more into gaming, I still follow the culture but I don’t have a lot of time for it currently.

I am non-judgmental and very open-minded, everybody has their why, what’s yours?



Honestly, starting up a new hobby with someone would be awesome too! Great starting point there, whats a hobby you’d like to pick up? If you don’t have one, what is your favorite current one?



I’m open to anonymous online friendships where we can keep things light or deep depending on the day. I may also be open to real-life connections if you’re in Michigan and want to grab coffee, hang out, or catch a concert, after we've gotten to know each other really well and feel safe, I’d be into that.

1neknsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoHangoutFriends/comments/1neknsw/looking_for_a_few_more_friends_in_roughly_2535/,"Looking for a few more friends in roughly 25-35 range, who genuinely just.. like people","I found a lot of great friends here so I'll give another shot and will keep it thorough!

**Who I’m looking for**

* Roughly in the 25–35 (give or take) age range
* My friends and I mostly hang out in North York or downtown, although some of my friends live pretty far, they usually drive to the GTA
* Emotionally intelligent, kind, and respectful of people’s time
* Interested in showing up regularly enough to actually build friendships (not just a “once in 6 months” type of thing)
* Enjoys low-key hangs: light board games, food adventures, both silly and deep conversations
* Curious about the world and about people, and good with personal boundaries
* Comfortable in group settings without needing to dominate or withdraw completely in conversations (maturity, please!)
* Steady and considerate energy. We’re not a match if you’re often flaky, overly competitive, or looking for heavy party vibes
* Not here to just find a dating partner or stir up gossip or drama

**Reason why a lot of us joined initially / are currently sticking around**

* Most of our friends have moved away physically, settled down, had kids, and we wanted to give a shot and find new people to share time with
* We are the type of people who don’t mind a group mix of introverts and extroverts (we lean more introverted overall)
* Some of us were new to Toronto and open to joining an already established group of friends (we’ve had multiple new people who clicked right away)
* We’re not a party animal, but you value having company, making memories together, and creating inside jokes
* We don’t have heavy responsibilities like kids that make it hard for us to show up. We are the people who have time to actually hang out and grow friendships now

**What my friends and I are about**

* We’re not a heavy drinking or late-night party crowd, we drink bubble tea and coffee far more than alcohol. We’re more the type to try new restaurants, go for tea & coffee, play casual games, go on the occasional hike, sit by a fire pit, watch a movie, grab some gelato, and chat about life.
* The best friendships we’ve made in this group came from people who showed up consistently, about 2-3 times a month, not just once in a blue moon.
* I’m looking to expand this circle just a little by taking a chance to see if a few more people out there also value both fun and depth, and believe that learning from each other’s differences and showing up for one another is what makes community and friendship stronger.

**A personal note from me (the organizer)**

I’m someone who’s genuinely curious about people. I find it fascinating how different our lives are, what we went through, and how different personalities interact, create new chemistry, and sometimes spark long-lasting friendships.

These days it feels like a lot of social life revolves around quick gratification, social media, ulterior motives and endless scrolling. What I want is to bring it back to something more timeless: building a small community where people actually show up for each other.

To me, that looks like grabbing coffee or tea together, doing simple low-key activities, sharing moments of celebration and grief, learning from each other, and offering a hand when we can. That’s the direction I’m going with my friends, and I’d love to welcome a few more people who feel the same way.

We’re not a group of “perfect angels”, just regular, low-key people who I personally find precious. That’s why I try my best to maintain what we’ve built and keep it close-knit. Sometimes that means making the hard call if things aren’t a good fit. And of course, this goes both ways: if you don’t find us fun, you’ll move on too, and that’s completely fine.

**So if you’re interested...**  
Please send me a personal message here with a quick or thorough intro! I’ll do my best to answer any questions you have, introduce myself and, you know, have a conversation with you, like a person first! So please don’t be flaky, cause a lot of people wasted my time and effort in the past. Just a heads-up: I won’t respond to vague one-word messages or people who clearly didn’t read what’s above.",6,1757624860.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,2,1.0,False

So let me get this straight:

* Hiding your penny in the same place as a host is a super bad thing, but only if your name is Wade. It's a fantastic idea if your name is Mark.
* The host's penny is conveniently always in the same place as someone else's, every single round.
* You're trapped in your coffins and can't leave them, except also the coffins don't lock and you could leave them at any time, Wade.
* You don't have access to tools with which to modify your penny but Mark can have a piece of string to tie it to a dragonfly.
* Mark's penny is out in the open where Wade should've instalty noticed it at the start, isn't it so stupid that Wade didn't see the penny that was right in front of him in this *game* where it's the host's job to *describe what the players see?*
* Wade can't see the penny tied to a dragonfly but Mark can suddenly see through coffee which is definitely an opaque liquid. Okay, sure.
* Mark can apparently now just ""find"" his own penny thus preventing Wade from ever finding it and getting a point.",2,1757624563.0,worldwadesupremacy,0,1.0,False

I'm a recovering codependent. This week, when I've talked with my Q I haven't given her advice. The moment I started wanting to offer commentary, I dropped it. I focused more on sharing, and let her share -- a bit like how people speak in the meetings. One thing I sense initially emerging is letting my Q be herself. She can say anything she wants. So today, when I called, as I hope regular contact will give her some connection in her somewhat isolated life, she just shared random things. No complaining. She even said the coffee hour at her child's school was complaining about the school buses, when there's nothing you can do about the city's traffic. She was flipping the script in a positive direction. That was a relief to hear, and near the end I told her I was really happy to hear her just talking, and not complaining. I hope that wasn't an 'evaluation' -- but if I can let my Q be herself, I have hope that it might not control or cure her, but at least let her be herself for once around me. I also feel more at peace, though a bit drained. ",7,1757624545.0,AlAnon,2,1.0,False

1neki5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/HardwareHit/comments/1neki5y/should_you_trust_the_sonicwall_tz370_firewall_for/,Should You Trust the SonicWall TZ370 Firewall for Network Security?,"The SonicWall TZ370, a compact network security powerhouse, is something I've been testing daily in my home office setup. It's marketed as a next-generation firewall with features like zero-touch deployment, multi-gigabit capabilities, and robust security options. What intrigued me was its promise to simplify network management while providing advanced protection. Having used it extensively for a few weeks now, I can confidently share both its strengths and the areas where it stumbles a bit.

**Performance and Speed**

One of the stand-out aspects of this device is its performance. Equipped with 8x1GbE ports, this firewall doesn’t hesitate when it comes to handling high-speed connections. I’ve put it through its paces, streaming HD content on one end, hosting a work video call on another, and even running a network-intensive game server simultaneously. Not once did it falter or show signs of struggling. Compared to some other larger routers I’ve tried, this one holds its ground impressively well. The inclusion of SonicOS 7.0 is a significant plus, as it allows for a streamlined and intuitive management experience.

**Ease of Setup and Deployment**

I was pleasantly surprised by how simple the setup process was, thanks to its zero-touch deployment feature. Using the SonicExpress app, I had it up and running in less time than it takes to brew a pot of coffee. No IT expertise is truly required here. For someone like me, who’s not exactly a network wizard, being able to follow clear, step-by-step instructions made a big difference. Additionally, managing the device through a single pane of glass is immensely convenient, sparing the need to juggle between different configurations or interfaces.

**Security and Features**

During testing, I utilized its VPN connectivity to securely connect different devices in my network to a friend's server. The process was seamless, and the hub-and-spoke configuration for communication between multiple locations works like a charm. I also appreciated its support for up to 16 access points, particularly useful for larger setups like an office or warehouse.

**Merits**

- The 8x1GbE ports ensure a fast and stable connection, even under heavy usage.
- Zero-touch deployment significantly reduces the time and effort needed for setup.
- Intuitive management via SonicExpress and a single pane of glass.
- VPN connectivity provides secure data transport for businesses with distributed locations.
- Compact yet powerful—perfect for home offices or small business environments.

**Shortcomings**

- SonicOS 7.0, while intuitive, has a bit of a learning curve for those unfamiliar with advanced networking settings.
- The compact design, while aesthetically pleasing, can lead to heat buildup during long hours of operation.
- It lacks Wi-Fi capability, which might make it less appealing for smaller setups that rely heavily on wireless connectivity.
- Limited out-of-the-box instructions might confuse absolute beginners.

**Design and Portability**

The device’s sleek and compact form factor impressed me at first glance. Measuring just 5.31 x 7.48 x 1.38 inches and weighing a mere 1.8 pounds, this appliance is easy to integrate into any setup without occupying much space. However, its small design sometimes led to modest heat generation during prolonged use. I'd recommend keeping it in a ventilated area to ensure optimal performance. Port-wise, the availability of 2 USB 3.0 ports and a console interface makes it highly versatile. I even tested the USB ports to connect additional storage devices, and they worked flawlessly.

**Product Rivals**

While the SonicWall TZ370 shines in most areas, it's not the only player in the field. Comparing it with products like the Cisco Meraki MX64, I noticed the SonicWall offers greater flexibility for those who don’t require a subscription-based model for full use of its features. On the other hand, the Meraki MX64 comes with its own strengths, like better-integrated cloud management. Another alternative, the Fortinet FortiGate 40F, provides competitive performance but lags when it comes to ease of deployment. The TZ370 balances advanced security options with user-friendly controls better than many competitors in its price range.

**Quality for Price**

For its feature set, this product offers solid value, especially for small to medium-sized businesses. While it lacks Wi-Fi, the multi-gigabit options, VPN capabilities, and high number of supported VLAN interfaces more than makeup for that if wired connections are your main focus. Investing in something like this ensures you'll spend less time troubleshooting your network and more time focusing on productivity or entertainment. Sure, the upfront cost might seem intimidating for personal users, but for anyone needing a secure and scalable network, it provides a compelling price-to-quality ratio.

1neki28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1neki28/i_need_help_understanding_something/,I need help understanding something.,"I am not new to manifestation, but I need help understanding what exactly it is that makes something manifest in the 3D reality. 

The reason I am asking this is because I have had two instant manifestations before that have surprised me.

The first time I ever had an instant manifestation was years ago when I was into law of attraction, way before I even knew about the law of assumption. I was intentionally trying to manifest a text. I put on a 15-minute subliminal and started visualizing a short scene of me receiving the text over and over again while chanting ""It's done."" I also remember feeling the emotions I would feel if I were to receive it. After the subliminal was done, I received the text. I didn't intend or believe it was going to manifest that quick. Till this day I'm still confused on how or why it manifested that instantly. 

The second manifestation was recently, a few weeks ago. I was casually imagining telling my cousins about the law of assumption. It was just a dumb visualization because I don't actually plan on telling them. In the visualization I explained to them that some people test the law by manifesting something unimportant like a cup of coffee or a specific car color. I remember mentioning a LIME GREEN car. Fast forward to a few hours after I had imagined that me and my dad were on our way to a birthday party and guess what I saw? A bright lime green van. And I have never seen that color before at all here. This one confuses me and most definitely surprised me because I wasn't trying to manifest that...it was just a part of an explanation in my visualization scene. I didn't believe or feel any emotions. But the amount of time in between the imaginal act and the actual physical manifestation was so quick.

Obviously throughout my whole entire manifestation journey, I have tried these exact methods with other desires which have not yet manifested. But it just confuses me because why did those manifest SO quick? If I have used the same exact methods for other things, why have those not manifested yet? I try to think about what exactly I am doing different when I imagined the things above versus when I imagine something I currently desire but I can't come to a conclusion. If it's not belief or emotions...then what is it? What specifically causes something to manifest in 3D reality, especially when sometimes it’s instant and other times it’s not, even if the same methods are used?",2,1757624482.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

i also find it hard to learn in class when i CAN stay awake in the way where i feel like i can't process the concepts fast enough, so i mainly learn by reviewing the slides or taking the time to listen to lecture recordings afterwards. i just study really hard and i don't procrastinate- this has been fine so far like it's time consuming but i get things done. have always thought it was just my study style but now i’m not sure. however, i recently started grad school and my lecture schedule is low-key insane so i feel like it's not feasible for me to keep this up bc then i’m in school for so long and then i’m behind and have to relearn everything and also i just feel bad for sleeping when the profs are taking the time to lecture for so long 😭


does anyone have advice on what they think is going on and if i should see a doctor to get this checked out for real? i just don't want this to be made a big deal if it's nothing and go on my record or smt. and if it is adhd is there any way to avoid medication as treatment? i would just be scared of being dependent on it and then not being able to properly function if i go off it (also idt my parents believe in adhd or anything similar so that would be a fun conversation 🤡). thank you!

extra info: this paragraph is prob irrelevant information but i’m just putting anything i can think of rn in case it helps. i've noticed since maybe 5 years ago that my core strength is super weak- just lifting up one leg off the ground has me shaking uncontrollably originating from my core. i'm not big into working out (smt i need to improve on) but even with periods of time where i exercised with the goal of strengthening my core it didn't really help. i've also been having a rash flare up on the back of the neck that started around last month? and this happened last year but the doctor didn't really have an answer and just gave me cream to help soothe it. the heat makes it burn and then there's some discoloration/brown scaly appearance in the areas that i have scratched (im going to see a np about this next week).",1,1757624223.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1nek9ft,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nek9ft,"Ex-OpenAI CTO's new startup just solved the ""impossible"" AI bug that's been costing companies millions - and they open-sourced the fix.","  
**TL;DR**: That annoying randomness in AI responses? It wasn't unfixable computer magic. It was a batch processing bug that's been hiding in plain sight for a decade. Ex-OpenAI CTO's new $2B startup fixed it in their first public paper and gave the solution away for free.  
  
You know that frustrating thing where you ask ChatGPT the same question twice and get different answers? Even with temperature set to 0 (supposedly deterministic mode)?

Well, it turns out this isn't just annoying - it's been a **$100M+ problem** for AI companies who can't reproduce their own research results.

# The Problem: The ""Starbucks Effect""

Imagine ordering the same coffee but it tastes different depending on how many people are in line. That's EXACTLY what's happening with AI:

* **Solo request**: Your prompt gets processed alone → Result A
* **Busy server**: Your prompt gets batched with others → Result B, C, or D

Even though your prompt hasn't changed. Even though your settings haven't changed. The mere presence of OTHER people's requests changes YOUR answer.

# Why Everyone Got It Wrong

For a DECADE, engineers blamed this on:

* Floating-point arithmetic errors
* Hardware inconsistencies
* Cosmic rays (seriously)
* ""Just how computers work"" 🤷‍♂️

They were all wrong. It was **batch processing** all along.

The Players

**Mira Murati** (ex-CTO of OpenAI who left in Sept 2024) quietly raised $2B for her new startup ""Thinking Machines Lab"" without even having a product. Their first public move? Solving this ""impossible"" problem.

**Horace He** (the PyTorch wizard from Meta who created torch.compile - that one-liner that makes AI 2-4x faster) joined her team and led this breakthrough.

# The Real-World Impact

This bug has been secretly causing:

1. **Research papers that can't be reproduced** \- Imagine spending $500K on an experiment you can't repeat
2. **Business AI giving different recommendations** for the same data
3. **Legal/medical AI systems** producing inconsistent outputs (yikes)
4. **Training costs exploding** because you need 3-5x more runs to verify results

One AI startup told me they literally had to run every important experiment 10 times and take the median because they couldn't trust single runs.

# The Solution: ""Batch-Invariant Kernels""

Without getting too technical: They redesigned how AI models process grouped requests so that your specific request always gets computed the exact same way, regardless of its ""neighbors"" in the batch.

Think of it like giving each coffee order its own dedicated barista, even during rush hour.

# The Plot Twist

**They open-sourced everything.**

While OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are in an arms race of closed models, Murati's team just gave away a solution worth potentially hundreds of millions.

GitHub: \[Link to repo\] Paper: [https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/defeating-nondeterminism-in-llm-inference/](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/defeating-nondeterminism-in-llm-inference/)

# What This Means

1. **For Researchers**: Finally, reproducible experiments. No more ""it worked on my machine"" at scale.
2. **For Businesses**: AI decisions you can audit. Same input = same output, every time.
3. **For the Industry**: If this is their opening move without even having a product, what's next?

# The Bigger Picture

Thinking Machines is apparently working on something called ""RL for businesses"" - custom AI models that optimize for YOUR specific business metrics, not generic benchmarks.

But the fact they started by fixing a fundamental infrastructure problem that everyone else ignored? That's the real power move.

1nek8w8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1nek8w8/newly_diagnosed/,Newly diagnosed,"Hi everyone,

For a few days I've had what feels like starving hunger pains and feeling sick despite having only eaten a couple of hours previously. It's been waking me up in the night too. I can keep the pain at bay by eating.

Saw the GP who's said I have gastritis and has prescribed Lansoprazole.

From what I've read I am surprised I've got this as I don't eat spicy foods, very rarely drink alcohol, don't take strong/daily NSAIDS, don't smoke, no coffee/tea, not overweight etc. 

The GP said it's probably from taking Citalopram but I've been taking this for nearly a year now and have taken it for extended periods in the past with no issues.

However, online said it can have auto-immune causes and I struggle greatly with eczema. I know eczema isn't officially an autoimmune condition but it does involve the immune system and is an inflammation condition. So I was wondering if the gastritis could be a kind of continuation of my body attacking itself? I had a bad flare up about a fortnight ago and whilst my eczema is now better than it has been in over a year, I've now got this stomach issue.

This is all just hypothetical and me trying to make sense of things but does anyone have any insight as to what could have triggered this?",2,1757623885.0,Gastritis,3,1.0,False

I am trying to choose between Peru/Colombia or Japan/Korea to live sometime  between January-April. I am looking for more insight to narrow down my choices to make an informed decision. Please tell me why I should come to Japan and if so, where I should stay!!

Some background: I am a university student doing online classes, so I will need access to the internet. I am from Michigan and fluent in English and Korean, and I will start to learn Japanese if I finalize my decision to stay there.

If I am to stay in Japan, I will fly to South Korea to visit my family for a few weeks. I am unsure of when this will be.

Some things I’m looking for:
- Ideally somewhere warm, but this is not important if many of my other preferences can be met as long as it’s not brutally cold. I want to escape Michigan winter!
- Access to nature. This is a non-negotiable for me. Mountains, beaches, trails, etc. I love cities and I would be perfectly fine in say, Tokyo, if it would be easy/cheap to go on hikes on the weekends.
- Relatively cheap. I am financially independent and have no support from my parents. I am willing to spend money to explore the world, but am doing so on a budget.
- Good coffee scene. Third-wave/specialty coffee is very important to me and I like trying new cafes.
- Good public transport, walkable.
- Good food/gastronomy and access to local, fresh produce!
- Nightlife is not too important to me but I would like to perhaps make friends around my age (undergrad) and it would be fun to live the life of a student in a city

Specific questions:
1. When is the best time to go? My semester is from mid-January to the end of April. I am thinking of staying in February and March, and spending the last two weeks of March in Korea. I am definitely open to alternative suggestions from people who know what it’s like to live in Japan!
2. Where to stay?? This is the most important question. Even after lots of research, I am unsure because there are so so many options. Kobe, Gifu, Okinawa, or Tokyo are some areas I am looking at.

 I really would appreciate any sort of advice at all, as it would be my first time living in a foreign country with no family or friends. Thank you!!",0,1757623753.0,travel,1,0.5,False

Chapter 1
The night before the wedding, my fiancé, Gideon Farric, destroyed the wedding dress I'd spent a year working on.
I trembled as I asked him why.
He lit a cigarette, his tone careless. ""Oh, Melanie thought the dress was too plain. She wanted to add a little color for fun.
""If you don't like it, just buy another one.""
Melanie Urwell. Gideon's distant cousin, who'd been staying at my house and acting like Gideon belonged to her.
I didn't say a word.
So, the most important moment of my life could be turned into a joke by someone else.
I didn't buy another dress. I simply canceled the wedding and boarded a flight to Colorado.
Gideon called nonstop.
""Where are you? All the guests are here, and you're just going to disappear?""
""Yeah.""
***
When I saw the wedding dress, splattered with paint, I thought I was hallucinating.
I'd asked Gideon to hang it up for me, to keep it safe in its dust cover.
That dress was the symbol of our eight-year relationship, which was about to have a happy ending.
I called Gideon and asked him what had happened.
He was silent at first, then let out a soft laugh. ""Oh, I forgot to tell you. Last night, Melanie saw the dress in my study and said it was way too boring for you. So she'd tweak the design a bit, as a surprise. Just a little joke.
""The wedding's today, so there's no time to fix it. I already told my assistant to buy a new one. Don't worry about it.""
Gideon's explanation was light and dismissive, as if it were nothing at all.
I stared at the glaring red stain on the carpet, refusing to give up. ""So, you think this is just a joke?""
""What else? Are you going to throw a fit again?""
Gideon's voice took on a hint of impatience. ""Is it really necessary? Emmie Caelen, it's just a dress. If you want, I'll buy you a more expensive one. It was just a joke—why can't you take it?""
I gripped my phone, then let go, my voice turning hoarse.
""If I hadn't come back early to check, was I just supposed to walk down the aisle in that joke of a dress? Gideon, this isn't a joke—Melanie did this on purpose, and it's vicious.""
Gideon's voice went cold. He snapped, ""Emmie, you're becoming more and more unreasonable!
""It was just a joke. Why are you making such a big deal out of it? Can't you drop this weird hostility toward Melanie?""
He grew icier with every word. ""How many times have I explained? Her parents died young, and she's all alone back home. My aunt asked me to look after her before she passed. She's young. She thinks of me as the only family she has—that's why she acts without thinking.
""So what if I indulge her this once? If you're so upset, maybe we shouldn't get married at all!""
Gideon ended the call.
I couldn't hold myself up anymore. I slid down the wall, collapsing onto the carpet, completely drained.
Gideon and I had been together for eight years.
I still remember when I was eighteen, burning with fever, and he carried me through pouring rain from my apartment to the hospital.
I remember at twenty-three, after my first business failed, hiding in a basement, too ashamed to face anyone, and he found me. He didn't say a word, just held me tight and whispered, ""Don't be afraid. We'll earn back what we lost together.""
Eight years. I'd gotten used to having him in my life. Everyone said if we broke up, they'd stop believing in love altogether.
So, in all my plans for the future, he was always there.
But now, just before our wedding, the ruined dress showed that Melanie stood in the middle between us.
I could have called the assistant to buy a new dress. With Gideon's money, he could've bought me one encrusted with diamonds easily.
But for some reason, the strength that had carried me through the last eight years was gone, and I couldn't pull it together anymore.
Chapter 2
I was lost in thought when a gentle knock sounded at the door.
Looking up, I saw Melanie standing in the doorway, wearing the pink bridesmaid dress I'd picked out for her, a cup of warm milk in her hands.
Her makeup was flawless, and she blinked at me with those wide, innocent eyes, feigning shyness.
""Emmie, I just heard you arguing with Gideon. Are you two okay?""
Her voice was soft and syrupy, with just a hint of provocation and smugness.
For the past six months, ever since she moved into my house, Melanie had always approached me this way—pretending to be naïve, fragile, and wronged—all while secretly relishing her little victories.
And now, standing in front of me, she wore the same mask.
I stared at her coldly, genuinely unable to understand why Gideon would treasure someone so transparently manipulative.
The truth is, Gideon hadn't always trusted her. In the beginning, he kept his distance, polite but aloof, sensing the games she played.
But everything changed during a company retreat. We'd gone hiking together, and on the way down the mountain, I twisted my ankle.
Just as Gideon bent down to help me, Melanie—who had been quietly trailing behind—suddenly let out a piercing scream and tumbled down a not-so-steep slope. She passed out right there.
In that instant, the way Gideon looked at me changed completely.
He didn't say a word—just scooped up Melanie's unconscious body into his arms and rushed down the mountain like a madman, leaving me and our stunned coworkers frozen in place.
Later, he explained that he'd acted out of a sense of responsibility, afraid something might happen to such a young, helpless girl.
But after that day, he never turned Melanie away again.
Eventually, Melanie moved into the new house we'd bought for our wedding, claiming she needed to recover and was too scared to live alone.
Everyone at the company knew that Gideon now had a frail cousin who needed his constant care and attention.
Meanwhile, I—the official fiancée, the woman of the house—ended up feeling like an outsider. People even gave me a nickname—Mrs. First Wife.
The first time Gideon heard it, he just gave a helpless laugh, then wrapped an arm around my waist and whispered in my ear.
""Don't listen to their nonsense. You'll always be the only Mrs. Farric.""
Chapter 3
I thought, ""Can I still become Mrs. Farric now?""
A bitter smile tugged at my lips as my gaze drifted back to Melanie's face.
She seemed uneasy under my stare and timidly asked again, ""Emmie, is Gideon really that upset? If you mind... maybe I should just move out now, and never bother you two again.""
No sooner had the words left her mouth than Gideon showed up behind her.
He was already dressed in a custom-tailored black suit—the very one he was supposed to wear as the groom tomorrow. But his brow was furrowed, and his voice was sharp and unfriendly. ""Melanie, didn't I tell you to stay in your room and rest? What are you doing out here?""
""Uh... I... I was afraid Emmie would be mad at you, so I wanted to talk to her, tell her not to take it to heart.""
Melanie immediately ducked her head, looking lost and on the verge of tears.
The anger in Gideon's eyes vanished in an instant. He walked over, gently ruffled her hair, and his tone softened. ""Silly girl, this isn't your fault. She's just being petty and overthinking things.""
""But..."" Melanie bit her lip, eyes lowered in secret delight, still playing the helpless damsel for all she was worth.
Gideon turned and shot me a cold look. ""Look at Melanie—so thoughtful, always trying to help you. And you? Emmie, you can't even take a joke. Pathetic.""
To him, Melanie ruining my one-of-a-kind wedding dress was nothing but a prank.
If I got angry, I was making a scene. I was unreasonable. I was cruel.
But why should I accept that?
I pointed at Melanie and snapped, ""Thoughtful? Do you have any idea how much trouble she's caused in the past six months?""
""She wears my pajamas, uses my mug, stays up half the night knocking on your door saying she had nightmares and wants you to keep her company—shameless!
""She acts like a damsel in distress every single day. If it's not dizziness, it's chest pain. If it's not allergies, it's low blood sugar. Anyone who didn't know better would think the Farric family had adopted some ancient relic to worship around the clock!
""To my face, she calls out my name so politely, but behind my back, I bet she wishes I'd get hit by a car the moment I step outside. I can't even stand to look at that fake innocent face anymore—I feel sick!""
With every word, Melanie's face grew paler.
Finally, she couldn't keep up the innocent act any longer. Her body went limp, and she nearly collapsed.
Gideon caught her just in time, wrapping her in his arms. Then he looked up at me, his expression stormy and dark. ""Are you done yet? Emmie, when did you become so bitter and vicious?
""Or is it that you never wanted this wedding in the first place, and now you're just looking for an excuse to cancel it?""
Chapter 4
A violent shudder ran through me, as if an invisible hand had clenched my heart so tightly I could barely breathe.
So this was it—Gideon could threaten me with canceling the wedding, too.
The message was clear. If I dared to make a scene again, there would be no wedding.
If we went through with the wedding, I'd become the envy of everyone—Mrs. Farric.
If not, I'd be the pathetic joke, the woman left at the altar for the whole world to laugh at.
I lifted my head and locked eyes with Gideon, refusing to look away. I stared at him for a long, long time.
It felt like I was looking back through eight tangled years of our lives.
For a moment, Gideon met my gaze, his eyes flickering as the tension in his face softened—just a little.
I knew him too well.
After eight years together, we could read each other's thoughts with a single glance, a single shift in expression.
For eight years, I stood by him as he went from a broke college student to the CEO of a thriving public company.
I was the one who handed him cup after cup of hot coffee as he pulled all-nighters, coding for his projects.
I was the one who learned how to make chicken soup for him, burning my hands in the process.
And after every success, he'd hold me in his office, gaze quietly at the city lights, and whisper, ""Emmie, thank you.""
We never imagined there would come a day when we'd part ways.
We never had the heart to say truly harsh words to each other.
But this time, Gideon was different.
His face had softened, but he still held Melanie tightly. ""Melanie's health is fragile—she has a heart condition. She can't handle you yelling at her like that. Apologize to her now, and we'll put this behind us. The wedding will go on as planned, and I'll let it go.""
In that instant, eight years of love crumbled in the face of his casual ""let it go.""
I couldn't look at him anymore. Suddenly, I laughed. ""No.""
The last hint of warmth drained from Gideon's face, replaced by a cold, stormy anger. ""Emmie, don't test my patience!""
When did it come to this—when Gideon needed patience just to deal with me?
Oh, right. He'd always been patient.
All his patience had gone into tolerating my little quirks and whims.
But it seemed he'd run out of patience for me. Now, every last bit was reserved for Melanie in his arms.
Suddenly, it all felt pointless.
I stood up, brushing imaginary dust from my skirt. ""Do whatever you want.""
Gideon's fists clenched. Still holding Melanie, he turned and walked away without looking back.
Chapter 5
I returned to my bedroom without even glancing at the ruined wedding dress.
Lying on my bed, I stared up at the ceiling, awake until dawn broke.
Today was supposed to be my wedding day.
At seven in the morning, the top-tier makeup artist and photography team I'd booked arrived right on schedule.
My best friend, Jolene Brickham, showed up as my maid of honor, bursting into the room in her gorgeous dress, radiant with excitement.
""Emmie! My queen! Get up! Today, you're the most beautiful bride in the world!""
But the moment she dashed into the walk-in closet to help me bring out the wedding gown, her smile froze in place.
She stormed out holding what was left of the dress—now nothing more than a piece of avant-garde destruction—her face a mask of shock and rage. ""What the hell happened here? Who did this?""
I calmly told her everything that had happened.
Jolene shook with fury. Right then and there, she tore off her bridesmaid dress. ""That bitch Melanie! Is Gideon blind or just brain-dead? This isn't a joke—it's sabotage! A full-on attack! Emmie, tell me—what are you going to do now?""
I sat up in bed, my eyes blank as I gazed at the morning sun outside the window.
What could I do?
Show up at the venue in some meaningless, last-minute dress my assistant managed to buy, stand before a man whose heart already belonged to someone else, and smile, recite vows, and say ""I do"" in front of hundreds of guests?
Just picturing it made me sick.
I couldn't do it.
My phone buzzed—a WhatsApp message from Gideon. ""I'm waiting for you at the venue.""
I knew this was his final ultimatum.
If I went, we'd still be husband and wife. To the world, we'd remain that perfect couple everyone envied.
If I didn't, eight years would end in a single day, and I'd become the laughingstock of the entire city.
Jolene was frantic, pacing in circles around the room. ""Emmie, say something! You're not seriously going to swallow this, are you? I'm telling you, if you let this go now, you'll be letting it go for the rest of your life! Melanie will walk all over you from now on!""
I smiled and texted her an address.
""Take the blue suitcase in the closet to this address for me. The lock code is my birthday.""
Then I turned off my phone, removed the SIM card, and flushed it down the toilet.
I stepped into the bathroom, took a long, hot shower, and changed into my favorite workout clothes. I slung my already-packed hiking backpack over my shoulders.

A gnawning/hunger after eating a meal. The bigger the meal, the hungrier I become. It’s not a normal hunger, its a completely empty feeling as if i haven’t eaten all day, when I literally just ate a meal. The last 6months this empty gnawning sensation appeared. So now its not just an empty feeling after eating, it feels like my stomach is irritated and inflamed after I eat. Somtimes my throat and tongue kinda starts to irritate as well. It’s after any kind of food but mostly with high fodmap foods and just big meals. I have been trying so many things because the doctors do not know what it is and just say I have ibs but I feel like my stomach lining is inflamed. I had an endoscopy and done blood test but everything seemed normal. There was some bile in my stomach but they said it was nothing to worry about. I stopped drinking coffee bc i thought it was causing silent reflux or gastritis but since quitting coffee it almost seems more inflamed. The healthier i eat the worse it gets (fruits, veggies, raw sauerkraut etc). I started taking 40mg pantoprazol to see if it would help but it works for two days and than it goes back to the empty stomach feeling. I am just hungry all day and not normal hungry just that hallow feeling in my stomach. I am 26f, lean muscular build, i eat healthy, high protein and clean. I am active and track my food, i eat more than enough. I just feel inflamed :( . Does anyone have the same problem? Or might know whats going on? I never have acid reflux, or stomach pain.

I was having issues it just not drinking water due to root rot, so a few months ago I decided to repot into terra cotta and thought it would be a good idea to trim the roots a little and shake the old soil out. It seems obvious now, but I think shaking the soil out was a dumb move because when I repotted I noticed the root mass is now just a lot of empty space and compressed roots without any soil in there. I think this is making it difficult for it drink water for this whole new reason now and not sure what to do about it.

I have a few ideas though and would appreciate input:  

1. Start watering by submerging the whole pot. This would certainly force water into all the nooks and crannies but I'm not sure if it will actually help it to drink.  

2. Air layer it from the trunk to get a new root mass going then chop the old one of. I like this idea because it also shortens it a bit and keeps it more bush like than tree. I'm sorry though that the new root mass might not be able to support the whole plant though and it could die before the roots catch up. 

3. Unpot the thing, hang it upside down, and fashin some sort of funnel around the root ball and try to shake and pack some fresh soil back into there. I think this could work, but also my soil-less root ball might not even be the issue since it's always had issues.  

4. Do nothing and hope that it grows new roots into the surrounding soil. Maybe watering exclusively around the edge of the pot so the water attracts the roots outward?",3,1757623001.0,houseplants,5,1.0,False
1nejv7y,https://i.redd.it/k7wv3qs6jlof1.png,I struggled with negative self-talk for years. So I built an app that catches it in real-time,"For the longest time, I knew I had a problem with how I talked to myself. Classic stuff - calling myself ""stupid"" for small mistakes, saying I ""always mess things up,"" catastrophizing every setback. I tried traditional journaling, but writing felt forced and I'd just abandon it after a few days.

One day I realized: *what if I could catch these patterns as I'm actually speaking them?* That's when the idea for **iOS** App [Archie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/archie-1-ai-voice-journal/id6747934094) was born - a voice journal that identifies negative language patterns and suggests gentler alternatives in real-time.

This is my first solo project, built over months of late nights and way too much coffee. For the past month I've been using it daily and it's genuinely shifted how I process difficult moments. Instead of spiraling into ""I'm terrible at this,"" I'm catching myself and reframing it as ""this is challenging right now.""

**How Archie works:**

* You speak your thoughts naturally (no writing required)
* AI analyzes your language patterns as you talk
* It gently highlights negative self-talk and suggests alternatives
* You can create custom word-pairs to target your specific patterns
* Everything stays private on your device

The weirdest part? It doesn't feel preachy or robotic. It's more like having a supportive friend who notices when you're being too hard on yourself.

What started as personal therapy became something I think could help others who struggle with their inner critic. The voice interface removes that ""blank page"" barrier that killed my journaling habit, and catching patterns in real-time feels way more effective than analyzing them later.

I'll keep improving it based on user feedback. Has anyone else found voice journaling more natural than writing? What features would make something like this more helpful for you?",3,1757622989.0,IMadeThis,0,1.0,False

Let’s break it down.

# What is mouth taping, and why do people do it?

Mouth taping is the simple act of placing a piece of tape over your lips while you sleep. Sounds strange, but it’s done for a very good reason: to promote nasal breathing.

Your nose is your body’s natural filtration system. When you breathe through it, especially at night, you improve sleep quality, reduce snoring, support oral health, and avoid dry mouth.

# What benefits do people actually see?

Here’s what most mouth tape users report after a few nights:

* **Deeper sleep** – nasal breathing keeps your nervous system calm
* **Less snoring** – mouth tape helps keep your airway open
* **Better mornings** – no more waking up with dry mouth or sore throat
* **Improved oral health** – less bad breath, fewer cavities
* **Increased energy** – from better oxygen intake during the night

# Is there real science behind it?

Yes. Studies have shown that mouth breathing disrupts sleep cycles, decreases oxygen efficiency, and increases the risk of oral health problems. Nasal breathing, on the other hand, is linked to better sleep, hormone regulation, and even improved athletic recovery.

One study even found that mouth taping significantly reduced snoring in people with mild sleep apnea.

# Are all mouth tapes the same?

No, and this is where most people get frustrated.

**Cheap mouth tape** (like what you might find on Amazon or in a first-aid kit) often:

* Falls off mid-sleep
* Irritates the skin
* Doesn’t create a full seal
* Leaves you frustrated, thinking mouth taping “doesn’t work”

If you’re going to try mouth taping, it’s worth doing it right, with a product designed specifically for sleep, like [Hostage Tape](https://hostagetape.com/).

# What makes Hostage Tape different?

Unlike generic tape, [Hostage Tape](https://hostagetape.com/) is built to:

* Stay on all night, even if you toss and turn
* Stick securely without damaging your skin
* Be breathable and comfortable
* Work for men with facial hair

Thousands of people have switched to Hostage Tape and noticed deeper sleep, less snoring, and better mornings after struggling with cheap alternatives.

# Who is mouth tape best for?

Mouth taping can benefit almost anyone, but it’s especially worth trying if you:

* Snore (or your partner says you do)
* Wake up tired even after a full night’s sleep
* Suffer from dry mouth, bad breath, or morning headaches
* Have nighttime anxiety or trouble falling asleep
* Are already using a CPAP and want to prevent mouth leaks

# Is it worth the price?

Let’s be real: Hostage Tape isn’t the cheapest option on the market. But that’s because it actually works.

When you factor in better sleep, improved health, and a snoring-free bedroom, the cost is more than worth it. It’s less than what most people spend on coffee in a week.

# Bottom Line: Is Mouth Tape Worth It?

Yes, if you use the right product. Mouth tape can absolutely transform your sleep. But most of the cheap stuff just doesn’t work. If you want real results, don’t cut corners.",1,1757622816.0,u_hostagetape,0,1.0,False

I have decided to extend back out into the reddit channels in hopes for a new partner or two. Not replacing anyone. I am specifically looking for an apocalyptic setting, starting at the beginning of said outbreak/virus, etc (details can be discussed in DMs)
**About me:** I am F/25+ and I am located in PST. 
I have been writing for about 15 years now, I usually match my partner and prefer the usual quality over quantity. I tend to write anywhere’s from 3 paragraphs to 5+ 
I play both male and female characters and tend to include side characters, also. 
I also like ooc chatter. I like to make new friends. 
A few extra points...

My literacy often reflects my partner’s. However, I consider myself adv.literate/novella. I adore lengthy posts. Quality over quantity.

I write both males and females, but only MxF pairings. I double, triple and use side characters. 

I prefer my partners to be 21+, but 18+ is also acceptable. I do write NSFW themes that don’t revolve around smut. 

That being said, I also love romance. Love/hate, forbidden, slow burn, all the cliches. 

If you need a day or two (or three!) to get out a response, then I’m fine with that. Sometimes I may take a day or two to think of a response. Other times, it comes naturally and only takes me 20 minutes. 

If I’m not interested, I will let you know. I expect the same. 

My only writing mediums currently are Discord and gdocs. 

I don’t care if you have faceclaims or not. I don’t care if they’re real life or not. I have a few claims for my characters, but I usually give descriptors in my writing. 

I like drama, angst, dark themes, anything and everything that can go wrong. I love torturing my characters for little reward. Let’s get into trouble.

Still here? Great! 
Below is something I've put together to set the tone. Details can be tweaked or changed, this only provides an idea of what I'm looking for.


~•~

Squinting at the bright screen that read ‘Eddy’, Lyla swiped right.

“...Hello?”

“Lyla, we need you at the office. Now.”

She took a moment to pull the phone away from her ear and tapped the screen to register the time.

“At four?” She questioned, “In the morning?”
“I can explain more when you get here. See you in ten minutes.”

“It takes ten minutes-” click.

-to get ready died on her lips and she sighed. So, no shower.


Setting the phone back on her bedside table, she glanced over at the figure next to her that had turned over, still asleep.

Whoever needed a lawyer at four in the morning was going to get an earful.


Lyla put on the first outfit she saw and managed to brush her teeth while trying to save her hair with some mousse.

She gave her husband a quick kiss on the cheek, who remained fast asleep.

Some coffee to go, and Lyla was on her way.


She was five minutes late in getting to the office, but Eddy didn’t seem to notice as he started talking a mile a minute the moment she stepped into the building.

“Woah, stop. I haven’t had my coffee and it’s early. Really. Early. Eddy.”

“There’s going to be a bulletin airing at eight this morning. I need you to pull everything we have on Actoflexiria. There’s been an outbreak. A big one. And we need to have our facts straight, plus the development process that was passed before we get hit with numerous lawsuits.”

Ah, so that’s why she was called in the early hours. She had to cover their ass.

“How do we know this is linked to Flex?”

“The sick ones are patients on Flex. Turn the news on at eight.”

Then I suppose I’ll be in my office. And Eddy, I expect breakfast.”


As Lyla went through her files, she wasn’t sure why this would be CDC business. The FDA approved of the drug; the CDC just made it.

It was quickly evident that her desk wasn’t sufficient enough to withstand all the files she had to pull and she was sitting in the middle of her office, surrounded by paper, when there was a knock on her door.

Lyla took the pen she held from between her teeth to answer, “Not now.” She answered, her brow furrowed.

The door opened anyways, admitting Daniel. He looked like he was going to say something and changed his mind, “So, you’ve heard.”

“No shit. Eddy thinks it’s Flex related. Except everything looks… fine. Even the clinical patients reported more pro side effects than the cons. No one minds a little nausea when they feel fit enough to run a marathon. And stress tests not only confirmed the newfound energy, they were able to follow through. So why are people getting sick?”

“I’m not sure.”
Lyla narrowed her eyes in annoyance, then softened her features, “At least Eddy will be pleased. I guess. Oh, it’s nearly eight.”
Four hours already? Damn.


Lyla extracted herself from her office floor and grabbed the remote to the television sitting in the corner of her office. Hitting the power button, the bulletin cut right in.

“Authorities have reported a significant rise in the death toll amid ongoing unrest, now reaching 300 confirmed fatalities. In response, local officials have implemented a strict curfew from 6:00pm to 6:00am in an effort to restore order and ensure public safety.

The curfew will take effect immediately and is expected to remain in place until further notice. Residents are urged to stay indoors during these hours, and law enforcement will be patrolling neighborhoods to enforce compliance. Authorities stress the importance of adhering to the curfew to allow emergency services to operate effectively and ensure the safety of all citizens. Updates will be provided as more information becomes available.”

“Death toll?” She questioned almost immediately, “Eddy said of an outbreak. I was confused enough about an outbreak through Flex, but… what?”

She clearly didn’t have all the facts, and data records weren’t going to help.


“Lyla-” Daniel tried, but she was already out the door.

The original goal of locating Eddy was short lived as the news seemed to cause a stir everywhere. If people weren’t going to demand answers from the hospitals, the CDC would be next on the list.


Nothing was normal about the day. Lyla had returned to her office, but work was the furthest from her mind. She scowled at the papers on her floor, figuring her early morning effort had proved worthless.

She stared out the window of her office, leaning her head against her arm. It took her a few minutes to realize that it wasn’t the usual ongoings in the street below. There was a heavier enforcement presence, but it was the people that caused her to lift her head in realization. Some looked fearful, others angry or upset. There was the odd person who kept to themselves. Anything but casual. Sirens had been heard wailing all day long.


Lyla stood straight, rubbing her eyes in a tired manner. It was nearing the newly placed curfew, though she was one of the few exempt. CDC perks, but her position didn’t seem like it would help too much at the moment. No one was currently thinking about suing the CDC, they were all too busy trying to wrap their head around what was happening. Lyla didn’t blame them, she was trying to do the same thing.


It was not knowing the exact circumstance. She had started pacing her office without realizing, running her hand through her hair multiple times.

Finally, she decided that Daniel might have some answers. He had the science knowledge that she lacked.

The building seemed relatively empty. Most had adhered to the curfew, probably thinking that it would be a temporary thing. Lyla hoped for the same, but she couldn’t decide on what she believed.

She scrubbed the back of her head as she waited for the elevator, figuring a good night’s sleep would do her some good after she spoke to Daniel. It had been a long day, to say the least.


She hit the button for Sector Seven, not prepared for what the elevator opened up to.

She was slow to step out of the elevator. Most of the glass lined lab cubicles had been smashed out and the entire sector seemed void of people.

“Daniel?” She called out tentatively. There was no answer, but an odd, wet sound greeted her instead.


Glass crunched under her shoes as she rounded a corner and could only react by clasping a hand over her mouth. Her eyes wide, she stared at an unimaginable scene. There was a lab rat, but it was the size of an average cat. Perhaps a bit bigger. But what she focused on was that the rat was intestine deep in a body. It had pieces in its’ large rodent hands, gnawing on it.

A sound escaped her and she had obtained the focus of the rat. It looked at her with a bloody face and she ran.


Lyla pressed the elevator button as fast as she could, hearing the animal behind her, but not daring to look. The doors opened and she slammed the lobby button, and repeatedly hit the button to close the doors. As the doors closed, the rat slammed into them, causing Lyla to jump back and she sank to the floor as the elevator started to move.

Her hands shook as she drew her knees up, putting her hands over her face. She only looked up when she reached the lobby and the doors opened.

Before she could move, something fell through the doors and it took a solid moment to register it was another body. She kicked it out of the way of the elevator sensors and hit whatever floor button she could reach and the close doors button once again. This time, when the elevator started to move, she hit the emergency stop button.


Still trembling, she slid her phone out of her pocket and dialed Daniel.

“Lyla?”
“Daniel! Are you okay? Where are you?”

“At home, where are you?”

“Stuck in the elevator at work. Daniel, what’s happening?” She could hear her voice crack.

“Stuck-? Nevermind. Look, you need to get home. I’m just not sure-”

“I’ll be there,” She promised, “Daniel, I love you.”

“I love you, too.”


Lyla hung up before anymore could be said and she took a shaky breath, wiping her cheeks. She dialed the only other number she could think of.

“9-1-1, what’s your emergency? Please note that we are assisting callers with needs that are directly affected by the situation currently going on.”
“I’m at the CDC, stuck in the elevator. There’s bodies and-” Lyla stopped herself, wondering if giant rats would make her sound crazy.

“Are you hurt?”
“No.”

“Alright, hang tight. We’ll send someone over. Are there any hostiles?”

“I- I don’t know.”

“Just a precaution. We have no estimated times, but we will get you out.”


She hung up and dropped her phone beside her, placing her face back in her hands, resting her arms on her legs. She took in a sharp breath, letting her body react, which included uncontrollable tears while she waited for someone, anyone to show up.


After the panic and adrenaline seemed to subside, Lyla removed her face from her hands. She couldn’t help but to replay what she saw down in Sector Seven. Every time she recalled the scene, she had to take several deep breaths so she wouldn’t physically react.

Her phone vibrated beside her and she took the distraction to look at it. An emergency notification had come out, reminding the people of the curfew. There was a mention of a danger to the ones who didn’t abide, but no specifics were given.

“Do giant, man-eating rats count?” She spoke to herself quite bitterly.


Lyla took a chance to look at the Nevada Appeal website for any articles that might shed some light on what was actually happening.

Rage takes control

Police struggle to keep up with calls

Conspirators claim The Purge is here.

A sound resounded from underneath her and she dropped her phone with a start. Her immediate thought was a gunshot. A voice followed, but it wasn’t clear. Was it help, or *something else*?


The elevator moved with a jerk and Lyla scrambled up, shoving her phone back in her pocket. Perhaps it was help, but she didn’t want to take any chances in case she had to run, again. Her brief research didn’t ease her fear.

The elevator doors opened and Lyla stared in turn at the four people standing before her. She felt compelled to mention the rat again, but instead, “I’m authorized to be out.., past curfew.”

She half fumbled for her clipped badge that was handed out earlier in the day that exempted her from curfew.

Whether they cared or not, she wasn’t sure. They all looked tired, more tired than herself. She probably didn’t look too great with disheveled hair and possible red, swollen eyes.

Lyla looked past the four, not seeing the body she had previously kicked out of the elevator.

“Does… Does anyone know what’s going on?”

The question sounded stupid in her own ears, but between what she saw in Sector Seven, the now-missing body and the news headlines, Lyla couldn’t connect anything. Enforcement had to know something.

I’m planning a 3-day trip to Indianapolis this fall and would love some local insights. I’ve got the big names like the **Indianapolis Motor Speedway** and **Monument Circle** on my list, but I’m more interested in things that *locals* love.

A few questions:

* Any underrated neighborhoods or walkable areas with cool vibes?
* Food spots that are iconic to Indy but not tourist traps?
* Any breweries or local coffee shops worth checking out?
* Best way to spend an evening that isn’t just a bar crawl?

Also, how walkable is the downtown area? I’m flying in and won’t have a car.

Thanks in advance—super excited to explore the city!

People who are down for a coffee, a beer, or just swapping funny stories. No agenda, no weird vibes — just some spontaneous human connection before I head back to maple land.

If this feels like a fun glitch in the simulation, slide into my DMs. Worst case, we awkwardly sip coffee. Best case, we have a great conversation and a story for later.

1nejju2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianMasculinity/comments/1nejju2/my_girl_passed_away_this_june_and_i_dont_know/,My girl passed away this June and I don't know what to do. I'm just so tired man.,"Growing up as an Asian kid  in Portland was really rough. Kids called me “chink,” “nerd,” threw my backpack in the trash, mocked my mom’s food. I was this scrawny kid who just wanted to vanish. By senior year, I was eating alone in the library, sketching to block it all out. Then I met Sam in 2021, senior year, both of us were 17 at the time. She went to Grant High School, a couple miles away. We met at this lame art fair our schools did together in October. I had some drawings up, feeling stupid, when she walked over. Sam was this white girl with short brown hair, freckles, and these blue eyes that hit me like a punch. She pointed at my sketch of a mountain and said, “Dude, this is legit. You’re an artist.” I thought she was messing with me, why would she wanna talk to a nobody like me but she just kept talking, smiling like I wasn’t invisible. Turns out she was very much into art and kpop however I still didn't know for a long time that whether she was legit into me or was she just pranking/bullying the nerdy looking Asian kid like everyone had done before her. Well we continued to talk after that day. We used to meet everyday after school and discuss everything that happened. She used to listen to me which at first felt odd because no one had ever listened to me. All they did was make fun of me. She saw more than the fact that I was yellow. She saw more in me than anyone ever had. Slowly minutes turned into hours and both ofhus were obsessed with each other. 

Those blue eyes of her I could stare into them for hours. We’d sprawl out on her bedroom floor, alphaville playing in the background and I’d just get lost in them. They were like the sky on a clear day bright when she laughed soft when she was serious. She’d catch me staring and  say “You good, weirdo?” with this grin that made my chest hurt. I told her about the bullying how kids used to shove me, called me names and she’d just look at me eyes steady saying, “They don’t know you. You’re better than all of them.” She made me feel like I wasn’t trash. Like I was enough.

So eventually Sam beccame the only thing that mattered to me, and I got this instinct to protect her. She was tough, but I saw her as my world, and I couldn’t let anything hurt her. I started practicing MMA , signing up at this local gym. I got into wrestling too for the same reason. I wanted to be the guy who could stand between her and anything bad(quite naive). I was garbage at first, eating punches, getting pinned, but Sam would come watch sometimes, her eyes lighting up when I landed a hit. It wasn’t about being a tough guy it was about keeping her safe.

We dated through high school and after. Sam had become my everything. We’d talk about getting married moving to Seattle me selling my art, her opening a coffee shop. She loved baking. Her chocolate chip cookies were always a little crispy but I loved them. We’d sit by the Willamette River her head on my shoulder, those blue eyes staring at the water, planning our future. I gave her a cheap promise ring last year said I’d get her a real one someday. She just kissed me eyes shining and said, “I just want us.” I’d stare into her eyes feeling like I’d WON.

Then this year's June happened. We were just scraping by but were happy cuz we had each other. Sam was driving home from her shift at this diner on Burnside when a drunk driver blew a red light. Her family told that she didn’t feel a thing, gone on impact. My whole world collapsed. The girl who lit up my life, who I learned to fight for was gone. I keep seeing those eyes in my head but they’re fading and it’s killing me. I don't talk to any one anymore, I literally have no friends and I keep seeing her again and again and again. Everytime I close my eyes all I can see is her face. My life has become so irrelevant that I just wanna end it all. 

These past 3-4 months, I’ve cut everyone off. No friends, no family, just me and this pain. I try to draw but it’s just her eyes and I can’t finish. I walk by that art fair spot hoping I’ll feel her but it’s nothing and stupid. I feel stupid even writing this rn. I wanted to marry her build a life With her . Now I’m back in the dark, and I keep thinking about ending it, but I know she’d want me to keep going. I just don’t know how. I just don't know what to do. I'm so tired. I just don't wanna see her no more when I close my eyes. It's like she's calling me. I'm so done guys. I don't wanna do this without her. I just keep seeing her.

1nejd5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBudgetBrides/comments/1nejd5p/timeline_dilemma_cake_cutting_fireworks_and/,"Timeline dilemma: Cake cutting, fireworks, and smooth transition to opening dance floor","Hi everyone! I am getting married outdoors in Italy and have a difference of opinion from my planner re timeline. From what I understand weddings in Italy focus more on the sit down portion for dinner and dessert. From wedding that I’ve been to in America, sit down dinners are not overly long as guests get tired of sitting. My planner believes that guest are going to want a longer time sitting down while I believe they’ll grow tired of sitting and will want to get up and dance sooner (especially because our wedding is already longer than most American weddings). 

Most of the weddings that I’ve attended in America open the dance floor immediately after the cake cutting. Guests can choose to eat cake whenever they’d like but the dance floor is already open. Currently, our timeline is such and the part with *** is what I’m most worried about: 

7:20-7:30pm: Bride and groom entrance + first dance + grooms welcome toast 

7:30-9:30pm: 2 hour dinner service (plated 3 course meal) with 4 speeches in between courses. Planner doesn’t want us to do the speeches while people are actively eating. 

9:30pm-9:50pm: Dinner ends, bride leaves to change to second look and dance floor opens for guest to slow dance while I change (we’re doing this because we want the older guests to have the opportunity to dance to slower music but don’t want to interrupt the high party energy once the dance floor officially opens later) 

9:50pm: Cake cut + fireworks

****10pm-10:15pm: Guest sit back down to eat 
cake and drink coffee. This is what my planner wants but I’d like to skip this part and immediately move to opening the dance floor with cake and coffee on the side for guests to get whenever they’d like. 

10:15pm: Dance floor opens

12am: Wedding ends 

We were hoping to use the cake cutting and surprise fireworks as a transition to open up the dance floor as we hope the fireworks get everyone pumped up to party. We feel that having guest sit back down to eat the cake will cause guest to lose momentum and we’ll have to find another way to open the dance floor. Our planner is adamant on sitting people back down to eat and drink coffee. But I think we should do cake cutting + fireworks then immediately open the dance floor with cake and coffee on the side for guests to get whenever they’d like. I think the people who want to eat the cake immediately will do so but the dance floor should already be open so that the people who don’t want to eat the cake right away can dance. 

What are your thoughts? If you agree with my planner then how would you open the dance floor besides just announcing that the dance floor is open? ",1,1757621830.0,BigBudgetBrides,5,1.0,False

I wish it was dramatic but it’s not. 

Long story short I lied and she took it personally, I wasn’t honest about how I lost money. I was in a lot of debt and was so ashamed of myself I lied about how I lost money, but this between me and her son (my partner) but because he needs to tell her every single fucking thing about me she got involved. 

Anyway after some space and a very fucking petty profile change, it sort of became fine until we met up for coffee and she basically said I make my boyfriend’s condition worse and etc. I don’t she just thinks her son is perfect and fragile when he’s not. 

I changed the Disney+ password because I don’t like being kicked when I’m down and then gave the password back, I wanted to give her the password because I was feeling generous and I’m not good with tone or sarcasm especially over text and said here’s the password, don’t change the avatars leave it alone and she responds annoyed saying I’m not a child etc which tbf I would too but the thing is she knows that 1. I haven’t grasped sarcasm 2. She treated me like a fucking child!
I know I’m in the wrong but she kicked me whilst I was down, made a whole situation worse than it actually was and made me seem like an awful person. 

I will apologise I know I could have worded it differently. She thinks she the only person to be abused and lied too when she’s not, she kicked me out when she knew how difficult it is for me in my house and basically isolated me. 
The profile picture was Pinocchio and she has been in my exact situation before so she was kinda being a fucking bitch. ",2,1757621807.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False
1nejcj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_zazusjourney/comments/1nejcj5/saturns_disregard/,Saturn's Disregard,"Saturn woke up the morning after his ceremony with mixed feelings. He looked marvelous, however felt guilty about denouncing his daughter's soul. She was peacefully sleeping in the other room of his family's treehouse and had yet to be informed of her fate. Saturn has always struggled to uphold promises and integrity.  

Saturn's wife, Storm, loves him to pieces, while he periodically messes around with other lemurs. She has known for years, but refuses to do anything due to deeply held beliefs on the sacred nature of marriage. His daughter, named Elsa, works hard in school and has a loving heart. So, what’s Saturn's role in his family trio?  He “works hard” to bring home the bacon by selling coffee beans to merchants from the city. 

A lovely aroma of French roast filled the air of the kitchen as Elsa woke up. She walked into the room to find Saturn sitting down and reading the Banana Bulletin. Politely, she interrupted him and asked for a cup of coffee. Saturn obliged. 

Sitting together, they waited for Storm to return with breakfast from the local bistro. Following a long pause, Saturn had to tell Elsa what he’d done. He explained that she means the world to him, but he felt pulled by his intense obsession with his own appearance. He then told Elsa how this caused him to spend his savings on acquiring special scrolls to achieve his agenda. Finally, as Elsa began to doze off, Saturn laid out the fate her soul faced. To his surprise, she was furious! 

Slamming her fists on the counters in a bout of rage, she ran into the kitchen and grabbed a large wooden bat. Next, she started to charge towards Saturn! He felt immediately uneasy and even had to dodge Elsa's blow and grab the knife from her hands.

Saturn raised his hands in surrender, his chest rising and falling as Elsa swung the bat wildly..

“Elsa!” he shouted, his voice breaking. “Please stop. I know I’ve failed you, but you have to believe me, I never meant to hurt you.”

His words cut through her rage. Elsa’s grip trembled on the handle of the bat, her breath ragged, her eyes brimming with tears. Saturn gently reached forward, inch by inch, until he placed his hand over hers. Slowly, she lowered the weapon.

The air was heavy with silence when the door creaked open. Storm stepped inside, carrying a woven basket of fresh pastries, Elsa’s warm smile faded the instant she felt the tension in the air. She set the basket down, her eyes scanning between Saturn and Elsa.

“What happened here?” Storm asked, her voice sharp but quivering beneath the surface.

No one spoke. Saturn glanced down at the wooden floor, while Elsa’s tears spilled freely. Storm’s gaze hardened as the truth unraveled from her daughter’s trembling lips.

“He… he gave up my soul, Mama.”

Storm almost had a heart attack. For years, she had endured Saturn’s vanity, his affairs, his broken promises.

Without a word, she turned and stormed out of the treehouse. Elsa quickly ran after her, calling through sobs, “Wait!”

And then Saturn was alone.

He slumped into his chair, staring at the half-empty cup of coffee growing cold on the table. The silence pressed down on him, heavy and suffocating. His mind drifted back to his childhood, to the nights his mother trudged home from the factory, her fur covered in soot and her voice weary. She would look at him with disappointment, shaking her head.

“You’re turning into a horrible lemur, Saturn,” she would say, her words laced with a bitterness that never softened.

Back then, he had thought that if he became beautiful enough—radiant enough—he could prove her wrong. He had spent his life chasing that illusion, sacrificing everything, even his family.

A rich aroma of French roast lingered in the background. Saturn buried his face in his paws, his reflection in the polished knife blade staring back at him, more hollow than handsome.

For the first time in years, Saturn felt the full weight of his choices & the love he had lost. Namaste

What I came to find out later that morning what happened ruined my week. 

In our environment, we utilize Privileged Identity Management to grant us the Global Administrator role on a need basis. Now going back in time a couple months in June, we shifted all of our Microsoft 365 licenses from E5's to Business Premium and Business Basic. I stressed to senior management it needed to happen - being it was a huge waste of money since we didn't utilize all of the features. Inevitably, those licenses expired as they should of. This ended breaking PIM because I didn't take into realization that we needed additional Entra ID P2 licenses for PIM to work. Boom, PIM is broke. No big deal, right? I'll just login to our break-glass global admin account and temporarily assign us the global admin role while we work on fixing PIM. Little did I know that our global admin account was in a disabled state and we didn't have the password on file.... Thus - unable to do anything in our 365 tenant.

There was a hard lesson learned here today.... To all of you 365 admins out there, **ensure you have a break-glass account, and you are able to log in.**

Thanks to my stupid mistake for not checking on this, I am now waiting on Microsoft 365 Data Protection services to unlock and reset the password - and we all know how Microsoft support can be sometimes. 

Once we can get logged back in, I am making sure that this never happens again and it's going to be apart of our DR testing every quarter, making sure we have the password, and we can get logged in.

You looked so beautiful today. You didn’t see me, but I saw you. You were laughing with that tall guy outside the coffee shop — the one with the stupid blue jacket.

I noticed you left your apartment at 8:12 this morning. You turned your key twice, not three times like you usually do. I could’ve walked right in.

You’d be happier without distractions like him. I’ll make sure of it.

Emily,

I took care of your problem in the blue jacket. He won’t bother you anymore. I learned so much watching him — the shortcut he takes behind the laundromat, the way he keeps his wallet in his left pocket, the fact he never checks behind him.

When he hit the ground, the sound was dull, almost soft. You’d be surprised how quiet it is when a person leaves the world.

You seemed sad today. I hope it’s not because you miss him.

Always yours,

Your best friend Anna talks too much. She told you to “stay away” from me once, didn’t she? She didn’t know I was close enough to hear, hiding behind the shelves in the craft store.

Anna screamed for a long time. I had to put my hand over her mouth, but she bit me. That’s okay — I’ll keep the scar. It’s a reminder of what I did for us.

Now there’s more room for me in your life.

Do you know he tried to fight me with his keys? Keys are funny things, Emily — you can use them to open doors, or you can use them to make someone bleed.

Fellow Trivandrum Business Owners & Marketers! Let's talk Local SEO. I've compiled a massive, detailed guide on the Top 7 Strategies that will work in 2025. Sharing everything I've learned.","Hey everyone,

I've been a part of this sub for a while and I always see questions popping up about how to get a business noticed online in TVM. It's a struggle I know well. I run a small [digital marketing ](https://mohamednafeez.com/)operation here, and I've spent years testing what actually works for our local market—from cafes in Kowdiar to tech shops in Karamana.

The game is changing in 2025. It's less about tricks and more about genuine local presence. I wanted to give back to this community by writing up a super detailed, no-fluff guide. This is long because I wanted it to be actually useful, not just a list. Grab a coffee.

**The Core Problem:** If someone searches for exactly what you offer + ""in Trivandrum"" or ""near me,"" and they don't find you, you're essentially invisible. Local SEO fixes that.

**The Top 7 Local SEO Strategies for Trivandrum (The Deep Dive):**

**1. Google Business Profile: Your Digital Front Door. Nail This First.**  
This is the absolute #1 priority. It's free and it's what puts you on the map—literally.

* **Go Beyond Basics:** Everyone fills out the name and address. The winners do more.
* **Posts:** USE THIS FEATURE. It's like a mini-social media platform. Post your weekend specials, your Onam feast menu, a pic of your new inventory. Google rewards active profiles. I tell my clients to post 2-3 times a week. A simple ""Freshly baked cookies are out of the oven!"" post from a bakery in Sasthamangalam at 4 PM can drive evening footfall.
* **Photos:** Upload new photos constantly. Not just of your products, but of your team, your interior, your location. A shot that shows a familiar landmark (like the PMG junction or the Lulu Mall nearby) builds instant recognition and trust.
* **Reviews:** This is huge. You MUST respond to every single review. Thank the good ones. For the bad ones, don't get defensive. Apologize and offer to take it offline. People reading reviews look at how you handle criticism. It shows you care.
* **Q&A:** Monitor and pre-populate the Q&A section. Add common questions and answers yourself. ""What are your opening hours on Onam?"" ""Do you have parking?""

**2. Keywords: Think Like Your Customer, Not Like a Robot.**  
Forget ""web design."" You need to target ""web design company in Technopark Trivandrum.""

* **""Near Me"" is Gold:** ""Bakery near me,"" ""AC service near me."" Google knows the user's location.
* **Use Local Landmarks:** ""Restaurant near Kowdiar Junction,"" ""Electronics shop near Pattom.""
* **How to Find These Terms:** Just start typing your service into Google and see what autocomplete suggests. These are real searches. Also, look at the ""People Also Ask"" section.

**3. Get Your Listings consistent. Everywhere.**  
This is the boring, unsexy work that separates the pros from the amateurs. Your business Name, Address, and Phone number (NAP) must be **EXACTLY** the same on every single directory online.

* **Where to List:** JustDial, Sulekha, IndiaMart, AskLaila, Facebook, Yellow Pages, etc.
* **The Audit:** You might have listings you don't even know about. Inconsistencies (e.g., ""Flat No. 5"" vs. ""F-5"") confuse Google and hurt your ranking. There are tools to help find these (BrightLocal is a good one), but you can also do it manually by searching for your business name and phone number.

**4. Become a Local Authority with Content.**  
Write about things people in Trivandrum care about. This is how you attract links and show Google you're an expert.

* **Example Ideas:**
   * A real estate agent: ""A Complete Comparison of Buying a Home in Sreekaryam vs. Vattiyoorkavu in 2025.""
   * A restaurant: ""The History of Sadya and Where to Find the Most Authentic Version in Trivandrum.""
   * A tech repair shop: ""Common Laptop Issues Caused by Trivandrum's Humidity and How to Prevent Them.""
* This content ranks for long-tail keywords and gets shared locally.

**5. Speed Matters. Especially on Mobile.**  
If your website takes more than 3 seconds to load on a phone, you're losing customers. Most searches are on mobile. Use Google's PageSpeed Insights tool. Compress your images. A slow site is a death sentence for SEO.

**6. Build Real Local Connections (Links).**  
A link from a respected local website is like a vote of confidence.

* How? Sponsor a local school event in TVM. Get featured in a local news publication like The New Indian Express. Partner with a local influencer for a collaboration. Write a guest post for a popular Trivandrum blog.

**7. Track Your damn Data!**  
Don't fly blind.

* **Google Business Profile Insights:** It's free! It shows you how many people called you, asked for directions, and visited your website from your listing. See what search queries they used to find you.
* **Google Search Console:** Another free tool. Shows you your website's performance in search results.

**Final Thoughts:**  
This is a long-term game. You won't see results overnight. Start with your Google Business Profile. Get that to 100% perfection. Then move on to cleaning up your citations. Then start creating some local content.

I'm happy to answer any specific questions in the comments. I'm also curious—what's been your biggest struggle with getting your Trivandrum business seen online? Let's help each other out.",1,1757621628.0,u_Inevitable-Snow-4211,0,1.0,False
1nej9j6,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1nej9j6/why_frigidaire_fppwfu02_water_filter_review/,"Why Frigidaire FPPWFU02 Water Filter Review Matters for Cleaner, Safer Water","The Frigidaire FPPWFU02 PurePour Connect Water & Ice Refrigerator Filter has been a recent addition to my kitchen, and I've had plenty of time to integrate it into my daily routine. Designed with the ambition of keeping your water pure and tasting great, this filter doesn’t just stop at functionality—it aims to be smarter, safer, and more user-friendly.

**Ease of Installation and Design Aesthetics**  
I’m not a particularly handy person, but installing this water filter was straightforward and hassle-free. It fits snugly into my compatible Frigidaire refrigerator, thanks to its tailored size dimensions (2.2""D x 2.2""W x 9.3""H). The sleek and minimalistic design meant it didn’t call attention to itself, blending seamlessly into the fridge. Its lightweight build (0.5 pounds) made it easy to handle, and the durability of the plastic material reassured me it wasn’t cheaply constructed despite its weight.

**Impressive Filtration Capabilities**  
What truly sets this refrigerator filter apart is its certification to reduce up to 99% of contaminants. Since switching to this filter, I’ve noticed a significant improvement in the water quality—not just in taste but also in its clarity. Contaminants like chlorine odor and taste, lead, mercury, BPA, asbestos—even certain pharmaceuticals—are filtered out. This has made a tangible difference, especially when making coffee or tea, where clean water is so crucial.  

**Peace of Mind Through Smart Features**  
Here’s where this product takes a leap—from ordinary to exceptional. The PurePour Connect technology brings a level of innovation I didn’t expect. The fridge's control panel alerts me if an incorrect or counterfeit filter is installed, which saves any accidental frustration. Plus, it connects with the fridge's monitoring system to notify me when it’s time to replace the filter. This smart feature came in handy with my busy lifestyle; I didn’t have to keep guessing if it had been six months or track it manually.  

[Grab Frigidaire FPPWFU02 at the best price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b09mwqxhzf/)

**Key Benefits**  
- Excellent water filtration—removes most impurities.  
- Smart tracking technology avoids the guesswork of replacement.  
- Ensures only genuine filters are installed for added safety.  

**Water Flow and Efficiency**  
While testing the product, the water flow remained steady, and I didn’t experience any interruptions. Previous filters I’ve used tended to lose efficiency over time, but this one held its own across weeks of consistent use. You get up to 125 gallons of clean water or approximately six months of use, whichever comes first—plenty for a standard household.  

**Real-Life Anecdote**  
My coworker recently pointed out how often we buy bottled water unnecessarily. After a month of using this filter, I realized I’d significantly cut down on plastic waste. It’s saving me money while being a more sustainable choice. Even my little niece said the water from this filter tasted ""less like the pool,"" which speaks volumes coming from a seven-year-old.  

**Potential Pitfalls**  
Despite its strengths, no product is without its flaws.  
- The smart tech only works with compatible Frigidaire refrigerator models.   
- The price may deter some buyers, especially when compared to generic filters.  
- Frequent replacements every six months can feel like a short usage cycle for some households.  

**Competing Products**  
In comparison to other popular brands like Whirlpool EveryDrop and Samsung Aqua-Pure, the PurePour Connect holds its ground. While the EveryDrop offers similar levels of filtration, it lacks the smart tracking feature. Samsung Aqua-Pure filters, though effective, come at an even steeper price with no added benefits like counterfeit detection. The Frigidaire edges out through its balance of innovative features and effective filtration.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
While the cost of this product might initially seem steep, the high-quality filtration, longevity, and peace of mind it offers justify the expense. Other brands might cut costs at the expense of either efficiency or additional features, but this water filter manages to maintain a good balance. If you’re conscious about long-term savings and reducing environmental waste, it absolutely hits the mark.

I've never talked to these guys in class at all only through texts so this surprises and scares because it's so out of the blue and it happened a few days short of each other.",1,1757621575.0,AskIndianWomen,3,1.0,False

I’m trying to buy a closed coffee shop and open an ice cream shop and cafe. I’m struggling with time limits as the landlord is under pressure to sell asap. I fully created everything needed for my campaign and submitted last Wednesday. It’s a small campaign, only $30,000, and I’m starting to panic because I have no updates for my landlord, or the bank I’m working with for my loan. 

I sent them a support request on the 3rd business day (Monday) and just submitted another one. Is this normal or has this happened to anyone else? 

Edit: it has said “Please allow 1-3 business days for a response” since last Wednesday, I’ve gotten no emails and nothing on my account has changed",0,1757621520.0,kickstarter,19,0.5,False
