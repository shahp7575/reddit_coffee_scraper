One such way to do so is by optimizing your website for voice search. With the rapid growth of smart speakers and voice assistants, more and more consumers are turning to voice search to find what they need quickly and conveniently. Voice search is no longer just a trend‚Äîit‚Äôs a fundamental shift in how people interact with the web. If your website isn‚Äôt voice search-optimized, you may be missing out on a valuable opportunity to boost your business.

**Why Voice Search Optimization is a Game-Changer for Your Business**

Voice search has revolutionized the way consumers search for information. Whether it‚Äôs through devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple‚Äôs Siri, people are increasingly using voice commands to get answers on the go. This shift offers a massive opportunity for businesses to be discovered by a wider audience, but only if they are prepared for it.

* **Growing Popularity**: More than 55% of households in the U.S. are expected to own a smart speaker by 2022. This rapid adoption of voice-activated devices is transforming the way consumers make purchasing decisions.
* **Speed and Convenience**: Consumers today value speed and convenience. Voice search allows them to find what they need quickly, without the need to type in keywords. This increases the likelihood that they will land on your site.
* **Increased Mobile Usage**: Voice search is particularly popular among mobile users. With voice-activated searches accounting for nearly 30% of all mobile searches, it‚Äôs clear that voice search optimization is essential for any business looking to capture the mobile market.

**How Voice Search Optimization Can Boost Your Website Traffic**

Optimizing your website for voice search goes beyond just adding keywords. It's about adjusting your content and website structure to ensure that you provide the answers users are seeking‚Äîinstantly, naturally, and efficiently.

* **Natural Language Queries**: Voice search is more conversational. Users typically speak in complete sentences, often asking questions like ‚ÄúWhere is the nearest coffee shop?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best way to lose weight?‚Äù By optimizing your content to match these types of queries, you increase the chances of your site appearing in voice search results.
* **Long-Tail Keywords**: Voice search tends to involve longer, more specific search phrases. Incorporating long-tail keywords that mirror spoken language can help ensure your website is more discoverable in voice search results.
* **Featured Snippets and Position Zero**: Voice search often pulls answers from Google‚Äôs featured snippets (Position Zero). To increase the chances of your site being featured, ensure your content is optimized for featured snippets by answering questions directly and concisely on your website.
* **Local Search Optimization**: Many voice searches are local in nature. Users commonly search for nearby businesses or services using voice commands. Ensuring your website‚Äôs local SEO is strong (with accurate NAP details‚ÄîName, Address, and Phone number) will help your business appear in voice searches for local queries.

**Key Benefits of Voice Search Optimization**

1. **Increased Visibility**: By optimizing for voice search, your website has a higher chance of being featured in the voice search results, leading to more visibility for your business.
2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Voice search optimization ensures that users can find what they‚Äôre looking for faster, improving their overall experience on your site. This could lead to higher engagement and increased conversions.
3. **Competitive Advantage**: Many businesses still haven‚Äôt embraced voice search optimization. By getting ahead of the curve, your business can differentiate itself from competitors and capture a growing segment of voice-search users.
4. **More Traffic**: With more users turning to voice search for their queries, optimizing your website for voice search can increase the likelihood of your site being found, which in turn drives more organic traffic.

**Actionable Tips for Optimizing Your Website for Voice Search**

* **Focus on FAQ Pages**: Voice searches often involve questions, so creating an FAQ page or structuring your content in a Q&A format is a great way to optimize for voice search.
* **Use Structured Data**: Implementing schema markup helps search engines understand the context of your content and improves the chances of being featured in voice search results.
* **Optimize for Mobile**: Since voice searches are predominantly done on mobile devices, ensuring your website is mobile-friendly is crucial for capturing voice search traffic.
* **Improve Website Speed**: Voice search users expect quick responses. Make sure your website is fast and responsive to meet these expectations.

**Conclusion: Why Voice Search Optimization Matters**

The rise of voice search is an inevitable shift in consumer behavior, and businesses that adapt early will have a significant edge. Optimizing your website for voice search will increase visibility, enhance user experience, and ultimately drive more traffic to your site. As voice search continues to grow in popularity, it‚Äôs more important than ever to ensure your business is ready to capture this growing audience. Voice search optimization is no longer just a nice-to-have‚Äîit‚Äôs a must-have strategy for any business that wants to stay competitive in the modern digital landscape.

Start optimizing today and ensure that your business is ready for the voice-driven future!",1,1741112061.0,MarketingThougts,0,1.0,False
1j3hc3f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j3hc3f,"discovery sets, decants, and eBay! oh my!","CHANCEUX DISCOVERY SET FOR HER:

velvina: a warm and sweet cognac scent. it reminds me of kilians angels share. they are quite similar. i enjoyed wearing it, but for me personally, its a bit redundant as i already have a few angels share samples.

mango passion: a tropical, juicy mango scent. i appreciate the addition of passion fruit, and i could see myself reaching for this in the warmer months.

marshmallow island: ok, this reminds me of how i live on an island, but if somebody asked me where i‚Äôm from, i‚Äôd give the city name. if i opened with the island‚Äôs name, people would probably be like, ‚Äúwhere?!‚Äù but when i say the city‚Äôs name it‚Äôs way more recognizable. for this scent, we might be on marshmallow island, but we‚Äôre in citrus, raspberry, pear city. the fragrance is nice, but if anything, it‚Äôs like those vaguely ‚Äúfrooty‚Äù colored marshmallows. 

midnight cherry: this is everything i wanted kayali‚Äôs cherry to be! dark, sweet, a lil spicy. nothing is burning and there‚Äôs no incense to be found. i love it. buuuuuut‚Ä¶. i already own burning cherry, so‚Ä¶. jokes. on. me.

muffin man: do you want to smell like a muffin?! specifically, a homemade blueberry muffin where the berries are fresh, summertime ripe and juicy, you‚Äôve added lemon zest and a touch of cinnamon to the batter, and sprinkled the tops with that chunky crystallized sugar?!?! because this is that. it‚Äôs a muffin. if wanting to smell like a muffin is a crime, lock me up and throw away the key. this is who i am now ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü´ê

peach paradise: this is trolli peachy o‚Äôs. it‚Äôs candy peach, and it‚Äôs *okay* but it‚Äôs no peach‚Äôs revenge. i don‚Äôt hate it, but i don‚Äôt love it either.

vanilla matrimony: i basically bought this set *for* this scent. i was so excited to try it. first impression: this isn‚Äôt vanilla cake, it‚Äôs vanilla dough. it‚Äôs not wowing me. and out of all the fragrances, the longevity just wasn‚Äôt there. i tried wearing it multiple times, willing myself to see something, anything, i may have missed. but it‚Äôs just a basic vanilla and i don‚Äôt love it. i‚Äôm sorry! i wanted to make this work so bad üò≠

f*n candy: green apple candies, cotton candy, some watermelon‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs cute, it‚Äôs sweet, it‚Äôs definitely candy. but idk if i want to smell like candy?! i feel like jerry in his pirate shirt declaring that i don‚Äôt want to *be* a pirate. 
 
overall thoughts and prayers: this discovery set was a bit of a let down. with the exception of muffin man (which i already own and love) there‚Äôs nothing that hasn‚Äôt been done before and maybe done better. i hate saying that because i really love his more non gourmand fragrances like nefertiti and cleo. maybe it‚Äôs because i already have a lot of gourmands, but i‚Äôm not vibing with these. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è i‚Äôm sorry. you do get a 20$ off a full bottle with purchase which is nice, and he does switch out what‚Äôs in the set, so chances are you wouldn‚Äôt get exactly what‚Äôs in this set anyways. longevity is great w/ everything i‚Äôve tried except the vanilla matrimony. sillage, idk. i‚Äôm not one to be out or about, so i feel like i‚Äôm never the right person to ask on that front. 

BTSO EXTRAIT EXTREME DISCOVERY SET:

black guava: nyquil. its giving‚Ä¶. nyquil. with my last btso discovery set i dutifully sprayed each tester strip and sniffed them politely, pinky up and everything. with this set, i didnt even bother giving them an air spritz before i was spraying them on with reckless abandon. that was a choice i sorely regretted with black guava. it was a medicinal mess. i‚Äôm not a scrubber tho. i suffer for my addictions, and fragrance is no different! i wore it all day waiting for the beautiful butterfly to emerge. she didn‚Äôt. tread carefully with this one. üò¨

black mango: photo realistic mango lassi, but make it‚Ä¶.. leather daddy?! listen, i have no firsthand experience w/ the leather daddy community, but hand them a refreshing yogurt mango bevy and in my heart if hearts i believe you‚Äôll get this fragrance. 

oud candy: was expecting to hate this, but i‚Ä¶. LOVE IT?! what is oud? listen idfk, i‚Äôm donny and i‚Äôm outta my element here. i always assumed i didn‚Äôt like oud, the idea of oud, the concept of oud. i was wrong. please oud lovers accept my sincerest apologies. 

purple stain: listen i went into this expecting it to smell like the devils lettuce because apparently i went to zoolander‚Äôs school for kids who can‚Äôt read good and thought it was *purple strain* ü§£ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it‚Äôs not lol. no wacky tabbacky here folks! idk what this smells like. the description was written by somebody who‚Äôs doing more with their English degree than i ever will. good for them. spilled wine on an old journal??? okay, sure. i do like it tho. whatever it is.

my thoughts and prayers: i enjoy btso. this house might not be for everybody, but i think they‚Äôre fun, and weird, and i like them. for this set the real winners for me were oud candy and purple stain. naturally, the ones i gave the worst descriptions for. sorry about that. these fragrances are expensive, more so than their usual offerings probably given the extremeness of the extraitness. i could see my irresponsible ass springing for oud candy tho. (but not on shomer shabbos! i don‚Äôt f*cking roll on shomer shabbos!!!!!!)

SCENT SPLIT DECANTS:

donna sentenza (hilde soliani): it‚Äôs the dessert my mom makes with banana pudding, cool whip, nilla wafers, and sliced bananas. i love it. this is the banana of my dreams. longevity is great, lasted all day on my skin. 

fairest of them all (elysian): ‚Äúmirror mirror on the wall, who‚Äôs the most middle aged mom of all?!‚Äù doesn‚Äôt quite have the same ring to it does it?! i‚Äôm living my princess fantasy, having a midlife crisis. your typical tuesday. üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è this is a sweet apple and violet delight and i‚Äôm here for it. you can never have too many fruity florals. 

fragola (aziri paris): strawberry syrup. i‚Äôm not getting almond or biscuit, and the delicate red fruits are actually just strawberry syrup. this is my least favorite out of my order. but strawberry is having her moment, so i‚Äôll be layering this with the approximately 500 strawberry fragrances i already own. (i‚Äôm exaggerating, don‚Äôt come for me curating community!)

granita (aziri paris): love it. much better than her syrupy sister. i don‚Äôt have a good melon besides l‚Äôimperatrice, so i‚Äôll be wearing this a lot this summer. 10/10

venice rococo (arquiste): sarah w.‚Äôs review is 100% why i bought this. no regrets. floral, powdery, a dash animalic. i love it. sarah w. is the real mvp. 

panettone (milano fragranze): is it bread? is it cake? who cares because it‚Äôs delicious! i love a good panettone moment, and this is that. candied citrus, a lil rum, a bit bready. i *like* smelling like food. it‚Äôs a lifestyle choice.

thoughts and prayers: first things first‚Ä¶. why did i buy the biggest size decants?! because i‚Äôm american. i like my portions big and my coffee strong. i can‚Äôt help it. anyways‚Ä¶.. scent split is my fave site for decants. great selection, always a discount code to be found, and everything is always packed and shipped with care. 10/10

EBAY:

literally the weird baby holding above mentioned decants. do you love him?! because i love him. i want to fill my whole house with weird, sad, rubber faced babies. cue new collection threatening to take over my life and finances. this is fine. 

thank you for coming to my ted talk. i appreciate your time ‚ù§Ô∏è ",2,1741111967.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False

- Alex: Welcome to Bravo's Hot Mic, I'm Alex Baskin, and I'm here with Jax Taylor, and this is the third time that you've been on this podcast, and each of them has been very different. You were just on a few months ago, and you wanted to come on today because there's something that you wanted to talk about.
- Jax: I've been waiting for a long time to do this, and nervous, and I felt like, you know, this was the time to do it. We have season two of The Valley coming out shortly, and I feel like sometimes, because there's so many cast members, that the whole story of each person is not told, you know, fully, and I kind of wanted to come out and kind of talk about the struggles that I've been going through for a very, very long time, and I kind of wanted everyone to know, you know, this is what happened.
- Jax: I'm kind of coming, this is tough to say, so I am coming out that I'm an addict. I have substance issues, primarily with cocaine. Ooh, that's hard to say out loud.
- Jax: Yeah, I've been dealing with this for, I think, the last, on and off since I was 23, so I'm 45, so give or take. I've been, hmm, I've been, you know, there was times where I would stop doing it, but then there was times where I would go heavy on it. I think a lot of people who've watched Vanderpump Rules over the years could kind of tell that I was on something.
- Jax: You know, obviously production and people, they didn't know what I was doing. Everything I was doing is on my own. But I was just, you know, on that train and I couldn't get off.
- Jax: And people ask, you know, do you have an alcohol problem too? I don't necessarily think I have an alcohol problem, but the two go hand in hand.
- Jax: So I can't do cocaine without drinking. So I just gave up both. And I'm proud to say I'm 82, 83 days sober right now, which is the longest I've ever gone in my life without either.
- Jax: So, well, not my life without either, I'm sorry. This is the longest I've gone since I was 21 without, or just going this long without anything. And it's, I gotta say, it feels really, really good.
- Jax: But again, I just want to let people know like, this is a really, really tough disease, and it's a really tough sickness. And it's, I've been doing it for so long. And you can say hiding it, not necessarily hiding it, lying about it forever.
- Jax: And I just had enough's enough. I mean, this year was probably the hardest year of my life. I would say my father's death was the hardest year until this year.
- Jax: I'm going through a divorce right now, which is extremely difficult. And that's when Brittany and I separated, that's when the addiction got worse. Now I've always been doing it for a long time, but the addiction got worse during my divorce, during my separation.
- Jax: I literally lost control, you know. I kind of, I think at a point hit rock bottom, and you know, I had to go to rehab. That's kind of where we're at right now. And then I got out, obviously, here we are. But yeah, that's, yeah.
- Jax: I've never said this in my life. So to come out and say that I have an addiction, that I have a sickness, that I have to work on the rest of my life is a really big deal for me. Obviously, I think people have known that there's something out, but for me to say it out, come out of my mouth is, it's like, it's a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. Huge.

And I know that you've wanted to be able to say this, but I know that you've also struggled saying it out loud. (timestamp: 3:54)
- Jax: Yeah, because I thought I would just say it and then I wouldn't really work on it. I think I've worked really, really hard on my sobriety. You know, it didn't happen the first time. It, you know, happened the second time. What I mean by that is I had to go to rehab twice and we'll get into that later. But yeah, it's just a sickness. It's a disease and it's something that I have to work on for the rest of my life, unfortunately.

What prompted you to get help the second time? (Timestamp: 4:40)
- Jax: You know, I got a lot out of it the first time. And then when I was out, I was like, okay, I can get this. There was an incident. Brittany and I were actually on the way to a doctor's appointment for our son. And her phone was connected to my car. And a man's name came up and it just triggered me.
- Jax: I did slip after the first incident and I was, I did take substance the night before. And the next day is always the worst when you're after this. The next day is the worst. I lost it. I went crazy in the car, you know, yelling. And the worst part about all of this, and this is why I checked myself in, is that my son was in the back seat.
- Jax: And that's when I knew, I'm like, shit, I have a problem. It's still there. It's still there. Like I was very aware, I was yelling, and then I turned my head, and I see my son back there. I'm just like, this was just utter disgust, utter disgust. And Brittany was like, you need to go back.
- Jax: And I didn't even put up a fight. The first time I kind of put up a little bit of a fight, this one, I was like, you're right. You're right. I didn't put up a fight. I'm like, I gotta go back.
- Alex: And then Brittany reached out to a few people, including Lori, your publicist, Ryan, your manager, and me. We talked about the incident. You agreed to go, and this was over the holidays, right? So it was a very dark time for you.
- Jax: Yeah, it was, man, it was a very, very dark time. I mean, again, worst year of my life. I can't even tell you. I got out. I didn't stay the full time. I ended up staying 17 days. I felt like for me, that was enough.
- Jax: I was like, you know what? Another 14 is not going to do anything. I know that I'm good. I'm okay. I just needed to get back and be like, okay, for a second. I just needed to like, okay, remember why you were here the first time? You're back here for a second, regroup, and then get back out there. 
- Jax: And I felt when I hit the 17th day, I'm like, you know what? I'm here. I'm done. I won't do it again. You won't touch. You know, I'm done. I made a mistake. And I felt like it was the right decision for me at the time to leave right then. I was there on my own. I wasn't forced to be there. But I felt myself that I was ready to go.

I want to touch on a few things there. So first is when you got the diagnosis. So when you were told at the facility, look, this is, this is, like did you know going in that you were going in for addiction? Did you think you were going in for behavior? (Timestamp: 6:46)
- Jax: All of it. I was going to get to the bottom of it. Now, when myself and my manager and Lori, we all kind of came together and researched where I was going to go. I have such a great, great team.
- Jax: And we say, hey, listen, this is the best place for you because it kind of talks about everything, mental health, substance abuse, drug addiction, all that stuff. You're going to get everything out of this. And that's kind of what I needed because I personally don't think that drugs and alcohol are the problem for anybody.
- Jax: There's issues there that people use. There's issues with their lives. And then people use to kind of mask the issues that they're going through. I'm a firm believer in drugs and alcohol are never the problem. People just don't fix their problems. So they're too lazy.
- Jax: And then they use drugs and alcohol to mask their issues instead of fixing things. And that was the problem. So I was in therapy the first time, 30 days, seven hours of therapy a day for six days a week.
- Jax: I mean, it's intense. It's intense. And then you see doctors, and then you go to therapy, and then you go to personal therapy, then you go to group therapy, then you break for lunch, then you go for a walk, and then they allow you to go to the gym once a day.
- Jax: And there's a nurse that follows you to the gym. This was just utterly embarrassing for me because I'm going to Crunch Gym, which is a very big gym and people know who I am. And they're kind of looking at me, but they also see this nurse walking next to me.
- Jax: So it was like, it was tough. It was very, very, it broke me down. I got a lot out of it. Yes, I did slip when I got out the first time, but I learned so much the first time. It was my fault.
- Alex: Well, you weren't sober the first time, right?
- Jax: The first time I went through, I stayed sober for, I think, like a week after, a week or two after. And then I started slowly going back into the game again. And I thought, okay, I can handle this. I can handle it now. I got a grip on it.
- Alex: Because you were really, at the time, grappling with the bipolar diagnosis.
- Jax talked about how he was diagnosed by his regular doctor with depression and was taking Lexapro, but when he was in rehab, he got diagnosed with bi polar disorder and OCD and is on the right medication now. He now feels like this medication is helping with his anger

Drugs affecting Jax‚Äôs anger too (Timestamp: 12:03)
- Jax: Now, mind you, the drugs were affecting me too at the same time. And that people don't know cocaine, the next day is the worst. You feel like absolute shit. Like you feel at the bottom of the barrel. You have zero serotonin.
- Jax: You are just angry and depressed. Everybody, anybody who's done cocaine will tell you that. The next day is brutal. It's weird why we do it for two hours of fun and the next 48 hours is misery, but we do it. 
- Jax: And unfortunately, and the only time that Brittany and I really have ever gotten angry is the next day after a bender for me. That's the only time I've ever had a shouting match. I've never done a sober shouting match with Brittany ever. But fortunately, I was doing drugs so much that it was a lot.
- Alex: Right, and that your natural irritability would turn into outright anger.
- Jax: So I already have anger issues without the cocaine. Then you throw cocaine on there, then you throw alcohol on there, then you throw Lexapro on there. This was a fucking recipe for disaster. Like all these things, you know what I'm saying? So I don't know what was going on, taking all that shit, it was not doing well.

This will be on the show this season, you were repeatedly saying when you were asked about what your takeaway was from being there, I'm not an addict. My drug of choice is anger. (Timestamp: 14:33)
- Jax: I didn't think at that time that I was an addict. Now it's one of those things like if you hear any addict, right? I'm not the problem you are. I'm not the problem you are. I blame everybody else but myself. That's a token addict move.
- Jax: So when I got out, I'm like, I got a hold of this. I'm strong, man. I'm, you know, I'm, okay, good, I'll stop. And then a week went by and then I'm like, oh, okay, one drink's not gonna do anything, right? And like the drinking wasn't the problem. I have two drinks and I'm good.
- Jax: But after that two drinks, I'm looking for a bag of cocaine. So that's why people say, well, if drinking's not the problem, then why? But both go hand in hand, so I had to stop.
- Jax: But so to get back to the stay, why I took the second stay a little bit differently is because Lori and Ryan came to me like, okay, now we're gonna do it my way. We did it your way the first time, clearly that didn't fucking work. We're gonna do it our way this time.
- Jax: We're gonna talk to the therapist every day. You're gonna have our phone numbers. You're not gonna be on your phone. You're gonna be doing this. You're gonna do it our way. So I think the second time, they were kind of like, okay, it's our turn now to tell you how this is gonna go.

What have you done since you left to maintain your sobriety? Because obviously, as the cliche goes, for a reason, one day at a time. (Timestamp: 17:13)
- Jax: It is extremely one day at a time. It is, it's, you know, the big thing here is, is my son. I, he is my drive. He's my number one driver for this. I just, like I said, I can't do it anymore. It's, I'm 45 years old. Like, there's gotta be a point where you're like, dude, enough's enough. You had your fun. You know, you had a good time.
- Jax: You didn't, you're still alive. It's time to get out while you're ahead, basically. And I said, listen, obviously I'm not the type of person who can have one drink and be okay. It's just not in my cards. I had to stop. I was gonna lose, you know, custody, you know, I'm embarrassing my, I guess you can call my ex-wife.
- Jax: I'm embarrassing myself. Nobody's looking at me seriously. They're like, I'll just hear he goes again. So, and I want to do it for myself. I can kick this. I can do it. Is it hard sometimes? Yes. But I think how I look at it is the next day.
- Jax: How am I gonna feel the next day? How am I gonna feel the next day? For instance, you know, there was an event at my bar last night, and people were always like, we don't want to drink around you. I'm like, don't, please drink around me. I don't want people to walk on eggshells around me and be like, oh, we don't want to drink, because I used to make fun of the guys that were like me. 
- Jax: And now I want people to enjoy it. Have fun. I have to get used to that. And if people just walk around on eggshells, no one's going to want to hang out with me. It's like, oh, we don't want to bring the sober guy. He kind of is a Debbie Downer. And I'm not.
- Jax: I still have fun. I just switch over to Celsius now, and that's about it. Or I have a cup of coffee. But yeah, I don't mind people drinking in front of me. It hasn't bothered me. And I'm still doing events, and I still do appearances and like that.
- Jax: I'm very regimented now. I go do my appearances, and I'll take some pictures with people after, and I go right to my hotel. As before, I would wander around, end up meeting fans at a bar, drinking 25 shots, doing shots with every table.That's no more.

Tell me about what coming out with this means in terms of accountability, because obviously, there's no hiding. There's going to be a lot of scrutiny when you do go to bars going forward, which you do regularly because you own one, you have the business, and also you make a lot of appearances. All eyes will be on you. What does that mean to you? (timestamp: 19:27)
- Jax: I kind of turned this appearance thing around about not only part of the show, we like to answer questions about the show and all that, but I've kind of turned it into mental health and sobriety. You know, I talk about it now a lot. Instead of talking about, okay, you know, tea and everything going on, I kind of turn around and be like, I was struggling during this time.
- Jax: I've been on substance and this is how I got around it. So I'm using now these appearances is almost like I'm doing a lecture, you know, I'm turning it around instead of gossiping about Scheana, Lala, or Kristen or whatever. I'm kind of be like, hey, I'm turning it like, this is what I was going through.
- Jax: I was struggling. I'm using this as therapy for me. I feel like this is what I was meant to do. And I love talking about it. I love kind of being vulnerable about it. But I've never in my life until right now, till today, have been completely honest with my sobriety, or with my addiction.
- Jax: Never, never, never. I've always leave things out, like, oh, I never gave you the full story. This is the full story, and I'm really happy about it. I'm really excited about it. But it's still a very, very, I'm very new in the sobriety thing. I'm what, 82, 83 days sober right now, something like that. And it's gonna take a lot of work. It's gonna take a lot of work.

What work are you doing to ensure your continued sobriety? (Timestamp: 20:58)
- Jax: Right now, I'm going to therapy. I go to therapy once a week. Probably should be going a little bit more. I'm gonna be getting ready to do, I think I'm gonna start trying to do a little bit of outpatient. I'm okay right now, but I need to maybe double up a little bit and do a little bit of outpatient. I check in with a therapist once a week.
- Jax: I go to therapy on Mondays. I'm drug tested every week, and that's something that I chose to do. I'm the one that chose to do that. And I'm also, you know, I want the results, which is a big HIPAA on certain these kind of things. But I said, you know what? I need to be held accountable.‚Äù
- Jax: I want to be drug tested every Monday. I want you to text my ex-wife every Monday with the results. I want you to text my team every Monday with the results. And they're like, are you sure you want to do this? Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. I will be here at every nine o'clock every Monday morning, and I'll be testing.
- Jax: Because it makes me feel better. It makes me feel like if I have this idea to slip, I'll be like, I'm going to be testing on Monday. I'm going to lose my job.
- Alex: It's accountability.
- Jax: It's accountability.

***Alex asked how him and Brittany were doing and Jax said they had a ‚Äúlittle bit of a blow up last night.‚Äù And it changes daily as far as how they are doing 

I mean, Brittany has been through a lot with you. (Timestamp: 25:00)
- Jax: Well, I think it's safe to say we kind of been through a lot with each other. Yes, I've got a lot of problem, a lot of issues, but we haven't been getting along for a very, very long time. And it takes two to argue.
- Jax: Can't argue by yourself. You know, I think we just have been unhappy with our marriage for a long time. And I think we were just kind of sweeping it under the rug and not talking about why we're unhappy.
- Jax: We were just kind of going through the motions. And I think it really came to a head last season on the show. I think without even saying it is when we did the hotel stay and she brought up having another baby.
- Jax: And I was kind of like I was more about interested in talking about maybe we should even stay together. You're talking about having another child? Like I didn't say it with that, but I said it with my eyes more or less.
- Jax: I was just like, you're kidding me, right? Like and I was just, I look back at it now like, gosh, what if we would have had another kid? I'm like, god, like, thank god, you know?
- Jax: So yeah, our relationship has been struggling for a very, very long time. And I am the type of person that this is, I'm a self-sabotager and instead of being a man and going and saying, listen, you know, Brittany, I don't think this relationship is going where it needs to go. We need to end or whatever.
- Jax: Instead, I'm too much of a pussy in my head and I'll just get angry and fight and make her leave me. So I don't have to do it. And that's what I did.
- Jax: I would get constantly go out. I would constantly go on benders. I would constantly come home hung over or drunk or the next day and start a war, hoping that she would leave me because I'm too much of an idiot. 
- Alex: Then you wouldn't be the bad guy.
- Jax: Then I wouldn't be the bad guy. But then again, I'm the bad guy. So anyway, regardless. But I've been like that with pretty much every girlfriend that I've had. I'll do something stupid so they break up with me. And that was the same situation.

***Jax says not only is he working on staying sober but he also is addressing that he is a ‚Äúvery insecure human being.‚Äù

Seeking approval (Timestamp: 30:06)
- Jax: I'm constantly looking for approval from females. Yeah, to be honest, like it's disgusting. It's really disgusting when you think about it, you're like, why do you need to call all these people? And like, I was so hurt and angry.
- Jax: It got really bad when I found out that Brittany was hooking up with my friend Julian, okay? Two weeks after we separated, two weeks. So I knew in my head that she's been definitely texting him prior because nobody hooks up with somebody that fast, especially a friend of mine.
- Jax. So when I heard that, obviously, and that's what was at my low, that's when I was doing all the drugs and drinking. Now I amped it up even more. So I was doing a little bit, I was probably doing it maybe a couple of times a week.
- Jax: Now I upped it up to three to four times a week, right? And now I'm even more in my head. So I'm like, I'm going to call every fucking girl I know
- Jax: I'm going to hurt her to the T. I'm going to literally sleep with whoever I can find. I didn't even think in my head. You know what didn't come to my head? It's scary. I'm a fucking father. I'm a father. Why couldn't I just think, Jax, stop for a second. You're a dad. You can't do this. Like you're a father. What is your son going to think?
- Jax: I didn't care. I was so into the drugs and the alcohol. And I was so into, I was so upset that she hooked up with my friend, which is ironic because what have I done over the years? I hooked up with my friends, girlfriends too.
- Alex: You have a storied history.
- Jax: I have a storied history. I can't be that angry about it, but it happened to me, so I'm fucking hurt. 
- Alex: And then you wanted her to feel the way that you did.
- Jax: I wanted her to feel the way I did. Like, I, and I was like, okay, who can I call? Again, going through the list of girls, I'm just going to do whatever I want, whenever I want with whoever I want.‚Äù
- Jax: Careless, reckless, didn't care. I didn't care because like I said, between the drugs, the alcohol, the anger, not being healthy, the lack of sleep, it was bad. It was like a, it's like one of those movies that you see where like the rock star is just off his, off, you know.
- Jax: I just didn't have a care in the world. I was so defeated, you know. Even though I wanted Brittany to leave me, like that was the whole goal. And then it happened. You're like, shit. This is not what I thought it was going to be like, you know. I'm not as happy as I thought I was going to be.

Well, and I think there's a difference between wanting her to leave you so that you didn't end the marriage and then also being hurt that she was moving on, especially when it was with your friend. (Timestamp: 32:44)
- Alex: There are two different things to me.
- Jax: There are two different things. I didn't necessarily think they were gonna date or anything like that. It just, you know, it hurt me because we were talking, we were talking a couple months after we separated, we would still hang out, and she said she wasn't dating anybody.
- Jax: And I found out by looking at her phone, I saw that she was texting this guy, Julian. And then I found out from Brittany's friends that it was been going on for months. And that's when I was just like, I didn't even see it. Like I got played at my own game. I was like tasting my own medicine for the first time.
- Alex: You got Jaxed?
- Jax: I got Jaxed. That's the best way to put it right there. I got Jaxed. I've never been, that's never happened to me before. I've never been on the other end of that. So I didn't know how to handle it. So what do you do? Jump back into drugs and alcohol.
- Alex: Well, you were in a bad state of mind. That is what immediately led to your first stent in the facility.
- Jax: Yeah, one night I saw that message in her phone from another guy. Thank god, my son was upstairs in his room. Thank fucking god. But I went crazy and I was just like, how could this happen? And I, now in retrospect, I look back and be like, why were you so mad at this? You deserved it.
- Jax: But I was saw red. I mind you, I was doing drugs, drinking in those days at that time. I didn't care. I was angry. I mean, show me any guy that wouldn't be pissed off that his wife is hooking up with his friend. You know, this guy I brought into my circle, who I took care of, who I brought, got a manager, who I introduced him to my friends.
- Jax: I took him under my wing. I took him to games and all this other stuff. Coming to my bar, he was hooking up with her and still coming to my bar at the same time. I had no idea. And so a guy like me with the ego, as big as this room, that happening to me as a recipe for disaster. You just poke the bear.
- Jax: Kristen used to say this to me all the time. Don't poke the bear. Doute always says that. And she was right. You don't poke me and I lost it.

Jax thinking he was keeping his substance use under the radar (timestamp: 37:16)
- Jax: I think for the most part now I look back. I wasn't, but I thought for the most part, I was keeping a lot of it under the radar. But clearly I wasn't when I watched back. I'm like, jesus, how big are my fucking pupils? Like, I'm sweating. There's no reason to be sweating in this scene. Why am I sweating?
- Alex: There were some signs.
- Jax: Yeah, there were some different signs. And like they did pull me aside a couple of times and say, listen, calm down on, you know, they didn't know. But they were like, if you're, they thought I was drinking too much, like relax on the drinking, relax.
- Alex: Yeah. I mean, that's the hard thing on sort of on behalf of production is you know what you see.
- Jax: Yeah, but they weren't like, they weren't supplying us. I would go off on my own. Like we would film a scene and like Jax, you have 30 minutes downtime, right? So most people go rest. I would go to a bar, get lit or go next door from SUR. There was a Mexican restaurant. That's where we all went because we weren't allowed to drink during scenes.
- Alex: Tortilla Republic.
- Jax: Tortilla Republic. During the filming days, they all frowned like no drinking, no drinking during this, during this. Like certain times we go to parties, sure. But we're doing important scenes. They were like, stay away from that.
- Jax: But we'd all sneak in the back alley or we would all go to Tortilla Republic. Kristin would have a flask, Stassi would have a flask. We would be in there, get ripped before a scene was going.
- Jax: Nobody knew where we were. There's ways around it, you know? We're not trying to make things better, but before we were filming, we would do this anyway.
- Jax: So now you are basically telling us, okay, we can't drink as much as you guys have been drinking. You guys need to pipe down. We're like, no, we're used to drinking all day, so we need to find a way to do it.
- Jax: That's how we cope with working at SUR and loving our job, and it's fun. It's like, this is why it's fun. If we can't drink, then this sucks. Makes working at a restaurant boring, especially SUR. So we found ways to do it. 

***Jax said he is California sober because he does smoke weed. He said all the girls are very team Brittany but he is going to hit up Lala when he is 100 days sober to see if he can talk to her about sobriety

1j3ha78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/1j3ha78/charlotte_metro_record_stores/,Charlotte Metro record stores!,"I've recently fallen deeply into record collecting so ive been going to a lot of record stores in the area.

I wanted to share my list of the ones I've been to and comments on each. Plus I'd love to hear if there are others I've skipped. 

Nobody asked for this but whatever I'm doing it 



Lunchbox records: the biggest and most popular record store in Charlotte for a reason! Huge selection of new and used modern and vintage. I really appreciate how they have all the recent new popular items front and center but also have good bargain bins to dig though bellow the shelves and in the further back rows.


Repo records: A bit smaller and more focused on vintage records than modern but it's definitely the most 'Hi-fi' store with a great selection of turntables, amps, speakers ect. In addition it's the only one I know of that consistently has turntable cartridges in stock. 

Hardy Boy records: nestled in the heart of camp north end it's at a beautiful location and surrounded by other great shops and restaurants making this the best place for a record store and coffee date (if that's your thing). In my personal opinion they are a bit smaller and it's the store I usually leave empty handed most often but it's also because it's the one I visit most often. Also, very subjective, but I feel they have the best music playing in the store. 


Nobel records: a bit outside of Charlotte in Matthews but a record collectors dream. You can really tell that they care deeply about records, particularly used records, and the 'art of the find'. Their YouTube channel is a gold mine of information about the entire world of record collecting. In addition they seem to be the only shop in town (that I know of) that ultrasonically cleans many of their used records before they sell them. For anyone who has bought a used record only for them to go home and find it all scuffed up and dirty, sounding like crap, this is huge! Definitely worth a visit! 

Sleepy poet: a bit out of my way so I don't go as often and don't have many comments but for being an antique store first it has a solid collection. 

Premium sound: this place shares a space with gold tone so it is first and foremost a guitar and guitar amp repair store so it does have the smaller collection of records from the other shops listed. That said I've had great luck finds both new and used records that I want and the staff there I find to be particularly friendly. 

Brass grasshopper: also in Matthews NC not too far from noble records. This is also a record store inside an antique shop so the focus is definitely on antiques so it has the smallest collection but there are still some good finds. It's also part of Hardy boy records. If you are in the area I would say first go to noble records and if you haven't found what you are looking for and/or haven't blown your entire budget it'll be worth swinging by

Ones I know of but haven't been: Mad Jack records and comics. 

Overall all these shops are great and are worth a trip if you are into these kinds of things!

1j3h6km,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1j3h6km/most_bizarre_internet_dating_situation_ever_long/,Most Bizarre Internet Dating Situation Ever - LONG READ,"Okay, so this is kind of a long story but I've had to retell it already what feels like 100 times to all of my friends/family. I am 21F, I am very successful for my age but not rich, and I have a lot of advanced career/academic achievements for my age that make dating within my age group very difficult, so normally I don't. I'm also 5'11 and want a man who is ideally significantly taller than me (6'3-6'5 range), which makes things hard. I've also lost over 120lbs in the last few years, which also just changed so much about my perception of the world and the world's perception of me, and a few other things that I would say make me a very unique individual and therefore makes dating extremely difficult. So again, I normally don't do it. I wasn't planning on actively seeking out dating until I had either achieved my dream body, gone to law school, or was 25 and my brain was fully developed, or all 3. I always said though that if prince charming happens to knock on my door, I most definitely wouldn't say no just because of these guidelines I set for myself.

Anyways, this entire story takes place within about a week. A guy adds me on Instagram and I accept his follow request, he has about 60 followers, but is following nearly 500 random women from our mutual university, which I didn't like and was pretty suspicious, but after we exchange a couple of messages and I made a joke about it, he confirmed that it was just him trying to get his following up. I didn't think that was the best approach to do that, but whatever, men are stupid, so again, didn't think much of it. His account was only a few months old (which I didn't think anything of, because mine is the same and I also don't even have 100 followers) and actually found it rather endearing for this man to not have a social media presence. His first message to me was very sweet and normal, just mentioning that I'm stunning and saying that if I was single he'd love to take me out, but if not that he'd respectfully back off. I responded to the message, because I am a very spiritual person and I don't want to decline any gifts from the universe before at least giving it a chance.

I agreed to go out with him for coffee or something similar, and I also stated to him that I didn't want to text much before we meet up to not waste either of our times. However, that did not go as planned. We majorly hit it off over text, and the more I learned about him the more I liked him. I had also had dating on my radar a little bit more than usual the last few months over a small recurring work crush, and had actually been talking about dating with my friends and family more, and what I would be looking for, etc. In a lot of the conversations I had about dating with my friends and family, I was essentially saying that statistically speaking, the kind of man I am looking for simply does not exist, and if he does, is more than likely already taken. The more I talked to this guy, the more I liked him and he checked every single box I had. Normally in the past when chatting with guys online, I find myself lowering my standard with every message they send just to make it somewhat work in my head, but with this guy, he hit all my standards and to an insane degree. Some may (and have said) that it is too good to be true, but so many things in my life are too good to be true, and I am an anomaly when it comes to a lot of aspects of my life, so why couldn't this be true as well? Also, I wasn't particularly looking to date, so it came when I wasn't expecting it, as they also say happens.

The more we chat, he starts to express the same kind of thing I was feeling for him but towards me, that I am what he has been looking for, dream woman, etc. This quickly turned into HEAVY love bombing, before we had even had a chance to meet. I figured that this really was the universe sending me someone, so for once in my life, I really threw practicality out of the window and fully leaned into this and just trusted that it would work out... boy was I wrong.

We had started talking on a Thursday, and the next day he was going out for a friend's birthday party and we had spontaneously agreed that he would come meet with me after. We're both in college, I didn't have plans so it might sound suspicious but in my head it was a cute little exciting spontaneous idea. He ended up drinking too much at his friend's party to come and get me (after I had already gotten ready...) and ended up cancelling. I was disappointed, but he texted me the entire time very apologetically so I wasn't really upset at all. Our main date we had planned was for Sunday.

We continue to talk until Sunday, and the love bombing gets heavier and heavier, and I really wanted to talk to him over the phone before we met in person, just so I could see if we even had any conversational chemistry or anything (wasn't even worried that this dude wasn't real or anything like that for some reason, I would call it intuition but my intuition is often comically off when it comes to dating). We never ended up talking on the phone for one reason or another, and Sunday comes around, and he texted me the night before and the morning of, that he was getting ready, when he was on his way, etc. After the ""on my way"" text, I hear nothing. He never shows up. My parents saw me get stood up by this guy who I was already convinced was the love of my life, and I promise you I do not say this easily, and it was so humiliating and heart breaking. I spent all day absolutely devastated, had to tell all of my friends what happened after I told them I was so convinced this man was the one for me, even when they expressed any doubt about him. My best friend however did not have any doubts about him based on the messages I showed her, and when I showed her the texts that he sent before he stood me up, she was convinced that something had to have happened to him and that he sounded way too genuine in his texts for him to actually have been lying and then stand me up. I wanted to believe that too, just for the sake of my own feelings and this relationship idea that I had already fell in love with in my head, but as hours go by, I lose more and more hope and figured that if something had happened, he would've been able to text me by now.

A few hours later, around 7 or 8pm on the same day (the plan was for him to pick me up at 10am), I get a text/call on Instagram from him stating that he had gotten into a car accident on his way to me and that he woke up in the hospital and his mom had to fly in from another state to come since she was his emergency contact. He also sent me a photo of a crashed red car, and he had previously said he had a red Mazda, so that added up to me. His story didn't make perfect sense, but I figured he was just frazzled because of what happened and he apparently had a concussion, so I didn't think much of it. However, I wanted to talk to him over the phone before I continued speaking with him at all because I really didn't have much to stand on in regards to believing him at this point. He even gave me his phone number in the paragraph of him explaining what had happened, but the number was disconnected or not working, which he seemed confused about and said that his SIM must've broken in the crash or something, and that he would be getting a new phone. Anytime we tried to call over Instagram, his audio wouldn't work for whatever reason. Looking back, there are so many red flags that would point to him lying, but still to this day I am just so unbelievably confused as to what the point was. He didn't ask me for money, we didn't hook up, he literally gained nothing from this unless he was just engaging in some weird emotional affair for his own entertainment.

Despite not talking to him on the phone, I still continued to text with him until we had planned our next day to take place on Wednesday. I end up getting him to send me a photo of his birth certificate, just to prove he exists, which he was very unhappy about my outward doubt to his existence in the first place (which I now see why, because he actually *was* lying). He happened to be born in a different country, which matched everything he had told me previously, but I could not find ANYTHING on the internet with his name, mother's name, or dad's name. I just didn't think much of it again since they were foreigners. He sent me a ton of photos and videos of him, ones that, if he was catfishing, could've only been obtained through him catfishing another guy, or literally hacking into someone's camera roll. At this point, I really believed him. As the days go by, the love bombing was more intense than ever, and all of Wednesday he texts me how excited he is, and time comes around for him to come pick me up, he texts me that he's on his way, stopping to grab some stuff (flowers, etc.), and to not worry. I was anxiously texting him at this point because I was just worried I would get stood up for nearly a 3rd time. His last text to me again, was that he was at the light and almost there, and then again, he stops texting. Every minute that goes by my heart sinks more and more and I literally feel like I'm going to throw up. I couldn't believe I had let myself get emotionally invested with this man over text despite my (now even more validated) reasoning to not text much before we met. After I get stood up for the 3rd time, I'm obviously done with this man. Absolutely devastated and broken, but done. I blocked him on Instagram, because I figured there was no way he would even attempt to explain this one. After like a day or so of intense grieving, I decide to unblock him just because I'm curious what kind of insane lie he'd come up with this time, or if he'd even have the balls to add me back again. And sure enough, he adds me back. I accepted his follow request and I immediately messaged him because I was upset, asking if he was playing some sick game to try and see how many time she can stand me up, and also called him a sick pathological liar, etc. He had also let me know how humbly wealthy he is (again, when he explained it to me it made sense, it wasn't like ""I'm an Arabian prince so I have a lot of money"" way, so I told him if he wants to talk to me he can send me 3k on Venmo, but that he probably can't because I was sure he lied about that too. He responds back like 40 minutes later just saying ""I didn't lie (my name)"". I didn't respond because I said if he wants to talk to me he can send me money lol. Later that night, I posted on my story for my friends birthday and then he called me on Instagram. In my head I was like, you know what, if this dude is actually going to speak to me over the phone and explain himself, then I'll hear him out.

Of course, the audio didn't work for one reason or another, so we didn't end up talking on the phone. He then proceeds to explain to me the most insane elaborate lie, sounding like a mafia fan fiction written by a middle schooler, that he received a call on his way to come get me about some evil guy murdering someone in his family, with a whole bunch of colorful language to make the entire thing as LEAST believable as possible. I was actually in awe at this point, as it really didn't even feel like I was texting with the same person when he was telling me all this, but a few of his texting habits were included so it most likely was him. I told him I didn't even want to hear him out unless it was over the phone, but he ended up sending me the messages explaining anyways. He ignored me asking to explain any specific details, and the ones that he did respond to also didn't make sense. He ends up suggesting, within his entire mafia fan fiction bs, that he can ""have our entire history wiped"", so that no one from where he is can access my information. At this point, I'm completely checked out of this conversation and just wanted to go to sleep. I just told him that I was done, and he reassured me that he never lied, etc. Then when I woke up the next morning, his account was deactivated and I have not heard anything from him since. That was Friday night and today is Tuesday.

There are so many more details but this post is already unbelievably long, but I am just so confused as to what the hell this was. If he was catfishing me, what did he gain from this? He also mentioned some things that would ascertain that he lives in the same area as our university, but could also have been known by someone who was trying to lie. He never asked me for money, he had my address and I was ready to get in the guy's car, so he could've murdered/trafficked me if he wanted to, so I'm just so confused as to what this dude's deal was.

This one has really thrown me for an emotional loop, and it happened to be that the one guy who I felt like was good enough for me either didn't exist or is an insane liar for whatever reason.",0,1741111591.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False
1j3h6ca,https://www.reddit.com/r/Club_Med/comments/1j3h6ca/club_med_miches_full_review/,Club Med Miches - Full Review,"Hey all, I went to Miches in early February and I keep meaning to come in here and do a thorough review but I keep forgetting. So here goes! Background is I used to go to Club Med with my family growing up (many locations, some that no longer exist!) and then re-ignited my Club Med love at Punta Cana last year. We are a family of 3 with a 4 year old daughter, and my dad tagged along as well.

  
Rooms: I found the rooms MUCH nicer at Miches than Punta Cana. I don't got to Club Med for the rooms generally and have the philosophy that I'm only going to sleep there so who cares, but I was AMAZED by the rooms at Miches. Much bigger with a separate kids' bedroom AND an extra bathroom. The beds were also much more comfortable.

Beach: Beautiful beach and so close to the rest of the resort, so easy to get on/off the beach and the swimming area was pristine. Lots of chairs and easy to find a seat. In PC I remember it being VERY hard to get a beach chair if you didn't get to the beach before 9am. Miches the beach felt very serene. We never even went to the Zen beach because we kept saying ""the whole beach is Zen""

Pool: Much smaller main pool than PC but still big enough since it's a much smaller resort. Again, MUCH easier to get a seat than it was at PC. And AquaGym is always my Club Med highlight and that was great.

Zen Oasis: LOVED the Zen Oasis at Miches. The one at PC feels more ""chic"" and the one at Miches was very natural/relaxing. The bar at the Zen Oasis has fresh juice and my husband loved that. They also made the best iced coffee at the resort AND they had a swim up bar. At PC there is a hot tub at the Zen Oasis, so I did miss that, but still loved going there when my daughter was at Mini Club.

Food: Here is where PC wins for me. I liked that there is only 1 buffet restaurant at Miches (I hated having to choose for every meal at PC!) and I liked that they were smaller, but the general quality seemed slightly lower than at PC. I still loved it and found something good to have every meal, but there were definitely items that I didn't love.

Kids Programing: My daughter did Mini Club. She didn't like Petit Club at PC and honestly was not too thrilled on Mini Club at Miches... the GOs were very nice/lots of great activities but I guess my daughter is just not a fan. We only sent her for half days (got her after lunch each day) and I think she liked Miches because it was smaller/more intimate and she's not very outgoing, so at least she got to know the kids better (she still talks about her friends). The main thing that was better at PC was the kids shows each night... the ones at Miches were very low production value which is honestly fine, not a huge draw for us, but my daughter did LOVE the complicated shows at PC when we went last year.

Overall, I found Miches much more relaxing than PC, though people who want more programming may prefer PC. I loved how intimate and small it was... at PC I felt like I spent so much time just walking back and forth to my room, whereas at Miches it was very easy to get back to the room to reapply sunscreen, etc. I think we'll go back to Miches.

my girlfriend (25F) has been throwing up brown, coffee ground like fluid for the last three days. i (22F) noticed the brown color of her vomit (because she literally puked on our bed when i was in it) and chalked it up to something she ate. it‚Äôs also very common for her to vomit from anxiety, and she‚Äôs been very anxious lately, so i really didn‚Äôt think much of it. until two days ago when she revealed to me she hasn‚Äôt eaten anything in two days, she‚Äôs only been drinking water, and she also started to notice blood in her vomit.

now this immediately concerned me because i know this is NOT normal. i‚Äôve struggled with an eating disorder that involves purging for about 5-6 years and not once i have ever thrown up blood nor has my puke been the color of something i didn‚Äôt eat.

i told her she needs to go to the doctor or the ER and she began refusing. i texted my mom who went to nursing school to make sure i wasn‚Äôt overreacting and my mom told me i needed to take her to the ER. in addition i also texted my ICU nurse friend and she said the same thing.

so i told my girlfriend i was either going to call 911 or i would drive her there myself, those were her two options. she wouldn‚Äôt let me take her, so i called the paramedics.

when they got to our house, she refused to go and the paramedics told me there was nothing they could do.

now, my girlfriend has trauma from hospitals due to her mother having been in the ICU for months. i totally understand trauma, i‚Äôm not trying to downplay her experience or anything, its just as an adult i‚Äôm very aware that sometimes you have to do things you don‚Äôt want to do for the sake of yourself or your loved ones. especially if your life could be at risk.

i bawled my eyes out for at least an hour after the paramedics left and she just kinda watched me and asked ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù and i was genuinely dumbfounded. i‚Äôve been in therapy long enough to know somebody doesn‚Äôt know how you feel unless you expressly tell them, and yet at the same time, i also felt like it was kinda obvious why i was crying. i mean i did just call an ambulance and she refused, putting her life at risk. i expressed myself and she had nothing to say.

i called my friend later and explained the situation to her, she basically told me that i have to remember that i can‚Äôt control people‚Äôs behavior, and i need to take care of myself in this moment, but maybe try to express myself one last time.

so i told my girlfriend, you can either go to the hospital or i want you to sleep on the couch tonight because i genuinely just need space if you‚Äôre not going to take care of yourself. she chose the couch.

the next day (yesterday), i felt eerily calm. i had begun to process that my needs in this relationship were not currently being met, and i couldn‚Äôt be with somebody who wasn‚Äôt going to take care of themselves due to the toll this was taking on my mental health. i can‚Äôt be the one who cares more about somebody‚Äôs wellbeing than they do.

so i told her this, and basically said you can either go to the doctor today or we‚Äôre done. now i wasn‚Äôt saying this to be manipulative or get my way, i simply had to set some boundaries for my own mental health. i had fully accepted by this point that the relationship might end, and i had to be okay with that, because for the first time in my life, i have begun to respect myself and become aware of what i can and cannot handle in relationships, and this is one of those things i cannot handle.

she agreed to go to the doctor (finally), so i drove her to urgent care immediately. 

when she came back to the car she told me she had to go to the ER because the doctor thinks she has pancreatitis, so i took her to the ER. 

we waited for 5 hours before she finally got a room, but i could tell she was definitely irritated with me the whole time. 

today she texted me and said she has gallstones. i asked if i could visit her today and she said no, which is fine, whatever, but i‚Äôm just basically wondering, am i the asshole in this situation?",1,1741110559.0,AITAH,8,0.67,False

---------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to finding the perfect living solution for modern families, a metal building with living quarters offers a unique combination of benefits. These structures are becoming increasingly popular due to their durability, affordability, and versatility. Let's explore why a metal building with living quarters can be a smart choice.

### Durability and Longevity

Metal buildings are built to last. Unlike traditional wooden structures, metal can withstand harsh weather conditions such as heavy rain, strong winds, and extreme temperatures. This resilience is crucial for families living in areas prone to natural disasters. Metal buildings are also resistant to pests, rot, and fire, ensuring your home remains secure over the years.

### Cost-Effective Living

Building a home can be expensive, but metal buildings provide a cost-effective alternative. Here are some financial advantages:

- **Lower Initial Cost:** Metal structures often have a lower upfront cost compared to conventional homes.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Many metal buildings can be designed with insulation that reduces heating and cooling costs.
- **Reduced Maintenance:** Metal requires less upkeep than wood, meaning you'll save more over time.

### Customizable Spaces

One of the biggest benefits of a metal building with living quarters is its adaptability. You can easily customize the layout to fit the needs of your family. Whether you need multiple bedrooms or open living spaces, metal buildings allow for flexible design options. This flexibility is great for growing families or those needing specialized areas, like home offices or playrooms.

### Quick Construction

Time is often a significant factor when building a new home. Metal structures can be constructed quickly due to their pre-fabricated components. The assembly process is generally faster than traditional wood framing, allowing families to move into their new living quarters sooner. This speed is particularly valuable for families who want to minimize the disruption of moving.

### Environmentally Friendly Option

For eco-conscious families, a metal building with living quarters presents an environmentally friendly choice. Metal is recyclable, and many buildings are designed with sustainable materials. Additionally, energy-efficient designs can significantly reduce your carbon footprint. You can feel good knowing that your home supports a greener planet.

### Minimalist Lifestyle

In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, many families are seeking simplicity. Living in a metal building encourages a minimalist lifestyle. The open spaces that come with these structures foster a sense of tranquility and reduce clutter. As a result, you can focus more on family time rather than worrying about maintaining a larger, more complicated home.

### Potential for Additional Spaces

A metal building provides options beyond just living quarters. Many families choose to incorporate additional spaces such as:

- **Workshops:** Perfect for hobbies or DIY projects.
- **Storage Areas:** Essential for organizing bikes, tools, and seasonal decorations.
- **Garages:** Great for protecting vehicles from the elements.

### Safety Considerations

Safety is a top priority for families. Metal is inherently stronger than wood, providing greater protection against break-ins and other security concerns. The fire-resistant properties of metal also add peace of mind for homeowners, allowing families to feel safe and secure in their living spaces.

### Community and Location Flexibility

Metal buildings can be situated in a variety of environments. Whether you prefer an urban setting, a rural area, or something in between, these structures can fit seamlessly into your desired landscape. Furthermore, their adaptability makes them a great choice in developing communities where zoning may have specific regulations.

Choosing a metal building with living quarters can be an excellent decision for modern families. Not only do they offer practicality and affordability, but they also provide a range of options that cater to different lifestyles. Embracing this innovative housing solution can lead to enhanced living experiences for you and your loved ones.

Design Tips to Optimize Space in Metal Buildings with Living Quarters
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Metal buildings with living quarters offer a unique and flexible solution for housing needs. These structures are often practical, durable, and can be customized to meet specific living requirements. However, maximizing space within these buildings is crucial to create comfortable living environments. Below are some tips to help you design your metal building for optimal space usage.

### Plan Your Layout Wisely

When designing a metal building with living quarters, start with a well-thought-out floor plan. Consider the following aspects:

- **Functional Zones:** Divide the space into zones for sleeping, cooking, and social interaction. Each area should be clearly defined to enhance workflow and make the space feel larger.
- **Open-Concept Design:** An open layout can create a sense of airiness. Combining living and dining spaces can make the area feel more spacious and allow for flexibility.
- **Positive Flow:** Ensure that movement throughout the building is intuitive. This strategy keeps the space organized and makes the flow more natural.

### Utilize Vertical Space

Metal buildings typically provide taller ceilings compared to traditional homes. Take advantage of this height by:

- **High Shelving:** Install shelves that reach the ceiling to maximize storage. Use bins and labeled boxes to keep items organized.
- **Lofted Areas:** If your design allows for it, consider adding lofted sleeping areas or workspaces. This method frees up ground space for other activities.
- **Hanging Storage:** Use hooks and racks to hang items like bicycles and tools, making them easily accessible while saving floor space.

### Smart Furniture Choices

Your choice of furniture can significantly impact your space. Here are some ideas:

- **Multi-Functional Furniture:** Look for pieces that serve more than one purpose, like a sofa bed or a coffee table with storage. This reduces the number of items you need, thus saving space.
- **Built-In Furniture:** Custom-built furniture can fit snugly within designated areas, avoiding wasted space. Built-in benches or tables can enhance functionality without taking too much room.
- **Foldable Options:** Choose foldable or extendable tables and chairs that can be stowed away when not in use, allowing for more open space.

### Effective Use of Color and Light

The colors and lighting in your metal building can create an illusion of space. Consider these tips:

- **Light Colors:** Stick to light or neutral color palettes for walls and furnishings. Lighter colors reflect natural light, making the space appear bigger and brighter.
- **Mirrors:** Strategically placing mirrors can reflect light and create depth, enhancing the feeling of spaciousness in your living quarters.
- **Natural Light:** Large windows are great for bringing in sunlight. Skylights can also enhance natural lighting while making your space feel more open.

### Creating Outdoor Connections

Don‚Äôt forget about the outdoor areas. Connecting your living quarters with exterior space can enhance the overall feel of your home:

- **Patios and Decks:** If possible, incorporate outdoor living areas. These extensions of your home offer additional space for relaxation and entertainment.
- **Accessibility from Inside:** Ensure that doors leading to outdoor areas are easily accessible to create a seamless transition between indoor and outdoor living.

When optimizing space in metal buildings with living quarters, every detail counts. By carefully planning your layout, utilizing vertical space, selecting smart furniture choices, and enhancing your design with color and light, you can create a functional and appealing living environment. Embrace the unique aspects this type of building has to offer, and tailor it to fit your lifestyle seamlessly. With these tips, you can enjoy a spacious, comfortable living area that meets your needs.

### Conclusion

Choosing a metal building with living quarters is a smart and forward-thinking option for modern families. The benefits speak volumes‚Äîfrom durability and energy efficiency to the versatility of space. With rising construction costs and a growing need for sustainable living solutions, metal buildings offer a practical alternative that doesn't compromise on comfort.

Designing these spaces presents an exciting opportunity to get creative.

## Choosing the Right material: Halulite vs. Stainless Steel vs. Titanium

1j3giav,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1j3giav/overcorrection/,Over-correction?,"I left Cata and came to retail. While there was a huge learning curve for all the systems (crafting, gearing, questing, etc) it was super refreshing to see the difficulty curve that was present; in order to get the best gear (mythic track) you needed to do the hardest content which also required a decent amount of skill and coordination. It felt that you actually had to work for some of the items and meant AOTC and CE had some value. Now with everyone complaining about the difficulty I think they went too hard on the correction to please the masses. S2 brings easier means to get gear by not only decreasing the difficulty of mythic+ but shifting the rewards a level too so while before you‚Äôd run a +7 for heroic end of run, you now run a +6 which in difficulty scales to a S1 +4/5 (closer to a 4 when you consider affixes). What does everyone plan on doing once you get full 6/6 mythic gear in PVE? At least in S1 if you‚Äôre an average player (me) there‚Äôs something to continue looking forward to and aiming for but it‚Äôll be barely 2 months before everyone is complaining that the season is dead and there‚Äôs nothing to do because they already got their mains and alts to 6/6 mythic. I don‚Äôt see where people lose track of the fact that blizzard has 3 major options to make the content last; time-gating rewards (X crests max a week), make the means of gearing scale with difficulty, or ‚Äúforce‚Äù (encourage) you to play content you don‚Äôt want to (think S1 difficulty but you get extra PvE caches by participating in PvP, pet battles, etc). 

I totally get some mechanics felt far more RNG than others in mythic+ but I think how they changed delves is far more inline to what should‚Äôve happened to mythic+ where sure some of it is going to be easier but you‚Äôre loosely gated on coffee keys (which you can farm for more than your quick 4) and the crests could be a smaller amount.

I totally get this is n=1 opinion and view but for real what content other than pushing keys is available for the folks who are good at the game? I think it‚Äôs going to feel so much more like classic where you can get bis real quick and then far more people leave sooner for the season. ",0,1741109990.0,wow,3,0.1,False
1j3gi9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1j3gi9l/eons/,Eons,"I never killed, I never had to.

As a child, I felt it ; violence, not as impulse but as inevitability. I watched a bully shove a boy into the mud, a teacher humiliate a student, a stranger sneer at a beggar. Each time, a quiet hatred filled me, but I did nothing. I simply whispered their names in my mind, sealing them away for another time, another life.

I was twelve when I understood what I was. My neighbor, Mr. Collins, delighted in cruelty. *You‚Äôre a worthless dreamer, he‚Äôd sneer*. I‚Äôd clench my fists but never retaliate. Instead, I thought, **Not today. But someday.**

Years passed, Mr. Collins aged, grew weak. And one winter morning, I read his obituary ; dead at 72.

**25 years later**, I sat in a coffee shop, watching a young man ; dark hair, sharp eyes, an arrogant smirk. **The moment our gazes met, a flood of memories crashed into me.**

Mr. Collins, on his porch, sneering. His voice, thick with disdain. The sting of every insult, every cruel word. My fingers dug into the table. My mind was certain,  The universe had returned him.

*A week later, he was dead.*

**That was when I understood. The universe cycled souls, and I had become their executioner.**

I never chose how or when, only that it would happen. A cruel professor,  deceitful lover, A politician who promised hope but devoured the weak. Each time, it was the same. The moment I saw them, **I remembered.** Every lie, every sin. And then, one way or another, they died. Some slipped on sidewalks. Some vanished in sleep. Some met violent, poetic ends ; each perfectly timed, as if the universe itself obeyed my silent will.

Decades passed, I marked names in my mind with no urgency. I had all the time in the world, but I always knew my power came at a cost. Killing sinners, no matter how justified, was still killing. And in the universe‚Äôs eyes, that made me one of them.

So, I planned for the inevitable.

*One last name, final judgment.*

The man ; a fraudster who built empires on the backs of the desperate ; died in his sleep.

And then, I turned to the mirror.

I met my own eyes. My name whispered through my mind, sealing itself away as all the others had before. But this time, there would be no waiting, no delay. If death was inevitable, then I would choose when.

No unseen force would take my power ; I would pass it to myself.

I exhaled, smiled, and let go.

**In a distant village, I was born again.**

My mother held me close, her tears silent as my grandmother loomed over her, voice sharp with cruelty.

I didn‚Äôt cry, only watched. Because I never forgot.

Even in death, I remembered. Every face. Every sin. Every name whispered across lifetimes.

In my mind, one more name sealed itself away.

And I smiled, **Not today. But someday.**",12,1741109988.0,shortscarystories,1,0.93,False

people hated the World handler so much for silly or plain misinformed reasons (cant coom to her, our palico hugs her in one cutscene only which means she STOLE them, shes reckless and loud, she says ""we"" did it but i didnt see her hunting the monster!! she just did a bunch of boring dumb useless research and preparation offscreen, which doesnt exist to me) and that her chatter is annoying just like every other NPC, but hers stands out only because she is with you the entire game. all of which has been amplified over the years by a community of people who circlejerk over these reasons but have never so much as gone back to watch World's cutscenes and would rather repeat unfunny shibboleths to each other for seven years

and now because of all the poop in the community's diaper, capcom gave us the most demure, unassuming, unassertive, bland handler in Alma to make sure that nobody can have a strong opinion about her that doesnt have to do with her looks. 

seriously, she looks like a barista at a coffee shop that sells merch. you could drop her into Seattle right now and no one would bat an eye. its like they aggregated traits that are attractive to your average shut-in gamer to make absolutely sure she is visually appealing to the point where she looks uncannily normal in a series often associated with its larger than life supporting characters

who is alma exactly? what does she bring to the table as a character outside of her role in the expedition? she wants to help Nata find his village (so does everyone else) and she wants to help the hunter and be useful to her team (so does everyone else, they just dont ride your dick as often about it because they arent attached at your hip). does alma do anything when shes not on the job? what does she even want now that Nata is reunited with the keepers? to continue doing research and uncover the mysteries of the forbidden lands? so does everyone else!!

oh but she nerds out about research, shes such a quirky dork! World handler did that too, but she's ugly so it wasnt endearing. AND shes stupid and reckless and cries and god i want her to fucking die, i guess. how dare she doesnt live solely to serve the MC like alma

now im not gonna defend the dialogue or writing choices in World at all. World was capcom's first real foray into writing a proper campaign/story for monster hunter and they made a LOT of mistakes, especially with the characters. i don't care for her, but at least the handler there was memorable AT ALL

but where it seems like they improved at writing other character archetypes they are so so SO scared of people hating the handler again that they decided to play it as safe as humanly possible. it really seems like capcom focus grouped her so much that she was boiled down into an unassertive waifu who wants nothing more except to be useful to the MC instead of being an actual character whose presence affects the world. 

tl;dr Alma is a bland non-character and it's the community's fault for overreacting to World's handler causing capcom to design a character that couldnt rustle any feathers if her life depended on it

1j3gd9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1j3gd9u/what_i_learned_after_tracking_expenses_for_2_years/,What I learned after tracking expenses for 2+ years,"Hey everyone! I've been tracking my expenses for the past 2 years, increased my savings 8 times, and I wanted to share some unexpected insights that might help others.

**1. Inflation is way more personal than headlines suggest**

I always read about inflation rates, but never noticed it in ‚Äúreal life‚Äù. After about a year of tracking expenses, I discovered this. It‚Äôs hard to track based on weeks or even months, and I really faced that after \~1 year. With the same expenses, the same quality of life level without any significant changes, I can‚Äôt fit my budget anymore. This realization was pretty disappointing. I was even thinking about stopping any budgeting and tracking activities. But that‚Äôs not the way, after a few days I returned to my normal state and decided to focus on increasing my income instead of abandoning my tracking habits.  
(my old tracking sheet after budget adjusting:¬†[https://imgur.com/oweKCyc](https://imgur.com/oweKCyc))

**2. ""Normal months"" are rare - and that's normal**

One of my biggest revelations was that there's no such thing as a ""typical month."" Looking at my data:

* Some months were 30% over budget due to unexpected car repairs
* Other months were surprisingly under budget.
* Holidays and birthdays always threw things off.
* Medical expenses came out of nowhere.

The key learning: Build a buffer for these ""surprise"" months. They're actually not surprises - they're part of life. ‚ÄúEmergency fund‚Äù is a must-have, but it‚Äôs not a magic pill, don‚Äôt rely on it too much.  
(my February nightmare, s\*\*t happens, just keep going:¬†[https://imgur.com/WXyb5ix](https://imgur.com/WXyb5ix))

**3. Impulse buying becomes harder when you track**

This was unexpected, but knowing I'd have to log purchases made me think twice about random buys. I simply don‚Äôt want to see those red numbers in my green budget life. Of course, it doesn‚Äôt save you millions (actually depends on your income/expenses, but not my case). It is more about preventing spending more.

**4. Finally understand where my money ACTUALLY goes**

Before tracking, I had this vague idea about my spending. Now I know:

* My ""cheap"" coffee habit was actually $180/month. (Dropped it to \~50 after a year)
* Subscriptions were eating $85/month (that‚Äôs a hard thing to deal with, but at least it doesn‚Äôt grow for now)
* I was spending way more on food delivery than I thought.
* Weekend activities were 2x more expensive than I estimated. I do not have children, it is just me, my partner, and a dog. I can not imagine the children‚Äôs impact on that.

**5. Adjust**

Adjust, adjust everything, and find your comfort zone. Do not set hard limits without knowing your actual spending. First several months¬†**must be**¬†‚Äútesting‚Äù months. You should get to know your habits, your money, your expenses. Do not set unrealistic limits. You will be disappointed when you go over that number. Instead, be curious about your spending, investigate them. Just live an everyday life. But set in advance the duration of the period. 2-3 months worked well for me, I think that period is crucial not to drop all that expense-budgeting things.

**6. Peace of mind?**

I do not think you can achieve real peace of mind with all that. However, you can gain control over your finances. I have never considered the connection between my psychological state and budgeting. Those two years were tough for me, and my expense-tracking habit was a small part of my stability. But it depends on your personality.

**Conclusion**

Tracking expenses is truly impactful, and it has really changed my life. Those 2 years were not my first try. I have tried several times before, but all of them have been unsuccessful. Maybe I was too young (I‚Äôm 27 now), or there were other reasons for that. I‚Äôve been working full time since I was 20, and for the first 5 years, I had less than 8k in savings. Now, after 2 years it is 8 times more. I can't attribute everything to budgeting and tracking expenses, but it helped 100%. Most of my money is in stocks and ETFs, so I do not have any short-term plans for them.

**Tips for anyone starting:**

* Start simple - just track everything for a month.
* Don't judge yourself in the beginning.
* Focus on patterns, not individual purchases.
* Be consistent with categories.
* Do not automatically import transactions from the bank, enter them manually.
* Use tools that don't feel like work.

**What's next?**

I will continue to track my spending. And I have a few more ideas about budget optimization and hacks to save money. I will test them this year and hopefully I will be able to increase my savings even more without any downgrades.

1j3gd42,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j3gd42/aitah_for_cutting_off_my_parents/,AITAH for cutting off my parents?,"I feel like I need this off my chest and someone telling me I‚Äôm not crazy. I‚Äôm sorry but you might want to grab a coffee/tea or any other drink, this is gonna be long. I‚Äôll be recounting what happened in my family recently‚Ä¶

Okay so let‚Äôs start with a trip my parents had to India to visit my cousin and celebrate his wedding, on their way back they would bring my gran back to us (this will be important later). Originally I was invited too. However I declined because I had an exam the day after the trip ended. I was told I could come with them anyway and just study there. I pointed out how the environment wouldn‚Äôt give me exactly what I wanted and I didn‚Äôt want to miss out on my last lectures that included help regarding certain topics. This was then made to look like I was being unreasonable for missing out on my cousins big day. 

During the duration of their trip I was then asked to look after the family dog. I agreed on the condition that it wouldn‚Äôt infringe on my contract with my flat near my Uni. I‚Äôve looked it up and talked to a janitor only to learn that all kinds of animals are forbidden and only quiet ones may be held after a permit has been issued. I gave my parents every piece of that info too, only to get told that I ‚Äúshould look for a new flat because you might need to look after our dog more often‚Äù. One thing lead to another and I just said ‚Äúf*ck it, I‚Äôll stay at home with the dog and ask my friends from Uni to give me materials‚Äù. As apparently I was creating another problem. 

But at home I was left the house too. So my chores were housekeeping, the dog, the plants, making sure the food is not spoiling and some other odd jobs. For example cleaning the restaurant counter (our downstairs is a family restaurant). 
I told them I potentially couldn‚Äôt do every job, and apparently that was understood and well received. But after a day they returned I got told off left and right for leaving food to spoil, plants to rot and didn‚Äôt clean the counter. I then told my parents that it was so much food that I couldn‚Äôt dream of eating it all, I could barely manage taking care of myself and the dog and forgot about the plants. 

An example with the food: my mum made a salad with homemade dressing on the morning of the day they flew abroad for a little over a week (they left at lunch and flew in the evening). And I could barely finish the salad in four days just before it spoiled as it was made for 5 people. Ultimately a lot of food spoiled and I got the blame for it.

I was also asked to cook certain kinds of meats and foods for the dog. Such as chicken hearts, chicken liver/kidneys, a pork fillet and some other pieces. I told them how I didn‚Äôt have a lot of money at the time and I would need some funds to pay for that. I didn‚Äôt receive any funds and they didn‚Äôt ask to pay me back for any money I spent on the dog. 

When I asked my mum about an allowance for the time I‚Äôd be at home, she made it look like I was greedy for asking for money again, while being in front of her best friend, which made me feel embarrassed. The thing is that two days prior I received the money she owed me to pay for my Christmas present as I bought it first and she would pay me back later. 

About a week before my parents would go for their trip, I told my mum that I wouldn‚Äôt like my gran in my room, as the bed at Uni is very hard and uncomfortable, while my bed at home is a queen sized bed with a foam mattress (very comfortable!). And it‚Äôs one of my few pleasures at home. 

After I returned home and was finished with my exams at Uni, barely a week after my parents returned, they were preparing to move soon. They had been thinking of selling the house for a long time and someone took interest in it. It was then that it was in its final stages. And I found out that my gran was using my room and sleeping in it. I looked for a quiet moment to speak to my mum, and asked her why my gran was sleeping in my room. 

My mum doesn‚Äôt like being ‚Äúconfronted‚Äù like that, as she has some trauma linked to that. I tried to be as calm and soothing as possible to make sure she knows I wasn‚Äôt trying to harm her. I told her how I felt about my gran using my room, and that it felt like she went behind my back to do this. But as someone might have noticed, I have some troubles phrasing things, and apparently came off as rude to her. 

I asked her what alternative accommodation she had prepared for me, as my room was now unavailable, to which she pointed at my brothers room, which was littered, and the bed was half covered by two jackets and a painting (she would point this out numerous times after this got ‚Äúresolved‚Äù and get back to me about my phrasing). 
I called it a ‚Äúdumpster‚Äù and said it wasn‚Äôt an option or at least nothing she had actually prepared. The point I was trying to make was that I didn‚Äôt feel welcome and it felt like they had forgotten about me. 
She asked for my understanding in a way that made it look like I was being selfish and unreasonable for her to tell her how I was feeling and I said it‚Äôs totally normal that if she gives my room away, she at least prepares something as an alternative. The only other free bed was in a room, my parents have been using as an actual dumpster for a long while now. Hence that room was ruled out immediately. 

My mum got furious and stormed off. After what seemed a few seconds, she came back and I had another question for her that had been on my mind. She had opened a package addressed to my name without asking for my consent (in my country that‚Äôs illegal) and I wanted to know why, to which she snappily replied ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt talk to this boy‚Äù and stormed off to my dad. 

After that conversation with my mum I went to the ‚Äúdumpster room‚Äù and readied up the bed. I freed up the bed itself, the room in front of it and brought new sheets in, when my dad walked over to me and told me to shut my trap and go into my room. I then try to tell my dad about how I‚Äôve been trying to be calm about telling my mum, but then he suddenly interrupts me over and over with the same message as before only to shout in my face to go into my room and be quiet. 

I say something in the heat of the moment and leave the house, while walking into the direction of a train station. Because we live in a rural area and it was an evening, I would need to walk three hours and couldn‚Äôt catch a bus to reach a train station. In that moment I thought of leaving only because I didn‚Äôt want my gran to be kicked out of my room, because I knew in that moment that this would be inevitable if I had stayed. I thought it wasn‚Äôt fair on my gran and tried to leave for good. I tried going to my flat at my Uni. 


They both said on phone ‚Äúif the door closes behind you, it won‚Äôt open again. Think carefully about what you‚Äôre doing there‚Äù. And they would bring up past events of how I wronged them, when from my perspective it wasn‚Äôt like how it was said. My mum argued with me over phone and while I tried being reasonable and respectful, she insulted me a few times. I‚Äôve known her to be like that for a long, long time. I‚Äôve tried being calm and collected, but that ‚Äúattitude‚Äù got me nowhere.

After my dad brought me home without slapping me like he said he would, I tried to leave asap. However my dad made the fair point of saying that I should at least help moving my own stuff. I agreed with that point and started helping them. I helped moving my brothers, my parents, my dad‚Äôs cooking stuff (he‚Äôs a cook) and his work tools from his workshop basically. And lastly I took care of my own stuff too. And my parents wanted to postpone me leaving them as long as possible. I strongly believe that‚Äôs because they wanted me there to help them.

My mum said as I brought that topic up a day before I managed to leave ‚Äúif you‚Äôre gonna go and leave us, who is gonna help us move then?‚Äù. I just left it uncommented.

While I was at my parents and helped moving, I did try leaving them permanently two times. During both times my mum tried physically stopping me. I left her free reign and let her do what she was doing as I didn‚Äôt want to entertain her nor did I want to accidentally hurt her. I just didn‚Äôt want them to have fuel against me. During both times she held on to me, tried destroying the bin bags I was having my stuff in (all over 20 suitcases were unavailable all of a sudden) or just blocked my way. After that she hid my bag twice and she snatched my mag-safe wallet. 

I genuinely tried leaving multiple times, I just didn‚Äôt have the strength to. Each time I genuinely considered it I would cry like a toddler. My girlfriend suggested making a list of what they did, what I felt was wrong during the time I was there and helping. Here‚Äôs the list of what happened during three days: 

- Dad shouting at me 
- Mum shouting at me 
- Mum insulting me 
- Dad said he‚Äôd punch me 
- Dad said he didn‚Äôt do anything wrong 
- Mum dragged me shopping despite me not wanting to go
- Mum asked me to put my phone away 
- Mum shouted at me for not getting her a glass right away to drink something
- Dad shouts at me for always having my phone in my hand, when I literally had my hands full and couldn‚Äôt do what he wanted of me 
- I was left to empty the full trailer alone 
- Woke me loudly despite me being exhausted from tiring work (as shown above)
- After being logged out tried logging into my planner app to check my mails again instead of deleting the app like she said she would
- Mum insisted on me to pick up my brother even though it‚Äôs valentines and there was no need for me to come along. I had asked her to be able to speak to my girlfriend and she made it look like I was asking for the world

Eventually I got all my ‚Äúconfiscated‚Äù stuff back and tried leaving for a third time. At that third time, I was done letting her have free reign. I tried getting my backpack back without hurting her and being as peaceful as possible. She ultimately said some very very mean and unforgivable things to me. I too, then dished out similar words as I was genuinely hurt and mad. However I didn‚Äôt try to physically hurt her at any point. She would get injured by losing her balance or she would hold onto my bag I was trying to pull out of her hands and that would leave her hands with marks. 

A few days after that, I got to the new house (the ones my parents freshly bought) to pick up the remainder of my stuff. My dad didn‚Äôt greet me back when I greeted him. I also greeted my mum, and she just stared at me and said nothing. After I picked up everything, and I was about to walk another mile with a bin bag that had my stuff in it as apparently there was no suitcase I could have borrowed, despite being promised one again and again. 

Then my mum saw me saying goodbye to my gran. I hugged my gran and apologized. Now I don‚Äôt speak my grans language nor does she speak my language(s), but we somehow can make do. My mum looked at me and asked me where I left my manners for not hugging her or my dad. And apparently my mother told my brother and dad that I hit her. Despite clearing it up beforehand (we had a 1.5 hour long call in which she admitted she was wrong going about it this way) and telling me she wouldn‚Äôt lie about this, she told my dad something else.

I‚Äôm not sure if she ever cleared it up to my dad and brother, however she told me she did, after I told my brother what actually had happened. 

After that, I think a few days later, I went back one last time. I went back to get my bike, a Suzuki GSF 650 Bandit from 2005. I wanted to get my bike to my Uni city as it would give me more freedom and mobility and make me less dependent. I was asked to arrive at 4pm, and my mum played it so, I would need to stay over the night and potentially for a day or two. However I insisted and rode my bike back in the evening. It felt like it was another ploy of hers.

I‚Äôve also been kicked out of the family Netflix account. And this too feels like something my mum did because she can be very petty.
I tried to talk to my brother about my parents and all, and he said about the shouting ‚Äúwhat else did you expect?‚Äù. I also pointed out to my mum that she can‚Äôt handle criticism that well, to which she screamed at me that she can‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm sorry this got very long, but I just felt like writing every single detail off my chest now. I had to rewrite this a few times too. 

AITAH for leaving? Did I really ruin my family relationships or is this just my own guilt? I feel crazy thinking about all of it and I can‚Äôt seem to calm down from it all.

EDIT: 
Here‚Äôs a TLDR.
TL;DR: The author recounts a difficult relationship with their parents, involving disagreements over responsibilities, boundaries, and communication. After feeling overwhelmed and unappreciated while caring for the family dog and managing household tasks, tensions escalated when the author discovered their grandmother was using their room without prior notice. Attempts to express feelings led to conflicts, including shouting and accusations. The author ultimately decided to leave the family home, feeling guilty and questioning their actions and the impact on family relationships.",4,1741109640.0,AITAH,3,0.75,False

1j3gcas,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/1j3gcas/what_i_learned_after_tracking_expenses_for_2_years/,What I learned after tracking expenses for 2+ years,"Hey everyone! I've been tracking my expenses for the past 2 years, increased my savings 8 times, and I wanted to share some unexpected insights that might help others.

**1. Inflation is way more personal than headlines suggest**

I always read about inflation rates, but never noticed it in ‚Äúreal life‚Äù. After about a year of tracking expenses, I discovered this. It‚Äôs hard to track based on weeks or even months, and I really faced that after \~1 year. With the same expenses, the same quality of life level without any significant changes, I can‚Äôt fit my budget anymore. This realization was pretty disappointing. I was even thinking about stopping any budgeting and tracking activities. But that‚Äôs not the way, after a few days I returned to my normal state and decided to focus on increasing my income instead of abandoning my tracking habits.  
(my old tracking sheet after budget adjusting: https://imgur.com/oweKCyc)

**2. ""Normal months"" are rare - and that's normal**

One of my biggest revelations was that there's no such thing as a ""typical month."" Looking at my data:

* Some months were 30% over budget due to unexpected car repairs
* Other months were surprisingly under budget.
* Holidays and birthdays always threw things off.
* Medical expenses came out of nowhere.

The key learning: Build a buffer for these ""surprise"" months. They're actually not surprises - they're part of life. ‚ÄúEmergency fund‚Äù is a must-have, but it‚Äôs not a magic pill, don‚Äôt rely on it too much.  
(my February nightmare, s\*\*t happens, just keep going: https://imgur.com/WXyb5ix)

**3. Impulse buying becomes harder when you track**

This was unexpected, but knowing I'd have to log purchases made me think twice about random buys. I simply don‚Äôt want to see those red numbers in my green budget life. Of course, it doesn‚Äôt save you millions (actually depends on your income/expenses, but not my case). It is more about preventing spending more.

**4. Finally understand where my money ACTUALLY goes**

Before tracking, I had this vague idea about my spending. Now I know:

* My ""cheap"" coffee habit was actually $180/month. (Dropped it to \~50 after a year)
* Subscriptions were eating $85/month (that‚Äôs a hard thing to deal with, but at least it doesn‚Äôt grow for now)
* I was spending way more on food delivery than I thought.
* Weekend activities were 2x more expensive than I estimated. I do not have children, it is just me, my partner, and a dog. I can not imagine the children‚Äôs impact on that.

**5. Adjust**

Adjust, adjust everything, and find your comfort zone. Do not set hard limits without knowing your actual spending. First several months **must be** ‚Äútesting‚Äù months. You should get to know your habits, your money, your expenses. Do not set unrealistic limits. You will be disappointed when you go over that number. Instead, be curious about your spending, investigate them. Just live an everyday life. But set in advance the duration of the period. 2-3 months worked well for me, I think that period is crucial not to drop all that expense-budgeting things.

**6. Peace of mind?**

I do not think you can achieve real peace of mind with all that. However, you can gain control over your finances. I have never considered the connection between my psychological state and budgeting. Those two years were tough for me, and my expense-tracking habit was a small part of my stability. But it depends on your personality.

**Conclusion**

Tracking expenses is truly impactful, and it has really changed my life. Those 2 years were not my first try. I have tried several times before, but all of them have been unsuccessful. Maybe I was too young (I‚Äôm 27 now), or there were other reasons for that. I‚Äôve been working full time since I was 20, and for the first 5 years, I had less than 8k in savings. Now, after 2 years it is 8 times more. I can't attribute everything to budgeting and tracking expenses, but it helped 100%. Most of my money is in stocks and ETFs, so I do not have any short-term plans for them.

**Tips for anyone starting:**

* Start simple - just track everything for a month.
* Don't judge yourself in the beginning.
* Focus on patterns, not individual purchases.
* Be consistent with categories.
* Do not automatically import transactions from the bank, enter them manually.
* Use tools that don't feel like work.

**What's next?**

I will continue to track my spending. And I have a few more ideas about budget optimization and hacks to save money. I will test them this year and hopefully I will be able to increase my savings even more without any downgrades.

People were scared, but most had the same thought as me. 

What the fuck am I suppose to do about it? 

Unless you were in the military or government, nothing really changed at first. You still went to work everyday, and then went home, but there wasn‚Äôt really any sense of urgency or fear, even in the nightly updates. 

Over the next few weeks, more and more countries went dark. One after a another, and yet, still no one really cared. 

The remaining governments were in chaos, but day to day, were still functioning. They put walls and security measures in place, but everyone could see that nothing they did was going to stop these things. 

Now, there are only a few pockets of people left. These things just kill, so infrastructures were pretty much left alone, and are still basically working for the most part. We can all see where this going, and I find myself asking the same question every day now.

1j3fxpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1j3fxpj/caffeine_addiction_is_very_normalized_here/,Caffeine addiction is very normalized here,"We as a nation are completely addicted to coffee. There are coffee shops everywhere in Tunisia and it is the normal place to meet. Most people I know cannot start their day before having a coffee and they will curse you if you speak to them before it. I will have no issue with this but for me it really becomes apparent how much of an addiction it is when people get depraved from it. 

Well now we are in Romdhane and most people fast which means they don't get their caffeine dose and only then the effects of this widely accepted addiction becomes apparent. Everyone in the street is on edge and groggy. People complain of headaches and lack of focus. Most people just jokingly say hchichet romdhan but I really think it is people just not realizing how much addicting caffeine is. 

Ok so all this to say is, I think caffeine is an actual addiction and it shouldn't be that encouraged and maybe it makes sense to consider it a bit like cigarettes. like OK it is not as harmful but maybe don't glamorize it. Maybe don't put it in coca cola and give it to kids. Maybe it should be respected as a mind altering substance. thoughts welcome. Do you also think that caffeine is abused in our society and there should be more warnings around its use.",6,1741108618.0,Tunisia,6,0.8,False

I looked through the window, watching a guy working inside, and my attention was suddenly caught by an albino lizard on the roof (if I can recall correctly, it was a bearded dragon but bigger). I kept telling the worker excitedly about it, and I guess at some moment I entered the coffee shop to get a better look at it. It changed from a lizard to a snake, but remained with the albino coloring, and when it slithered down to where I was another animal attacked it (I think a cat?). There was a commotion of people when it happened and the snake bit the cat back to free itself, but was quickly attacked by now a possum. The cat didn't die and only walked off with a limp, the possum chased the snake off and then I woke up. 

Something about this dream is nagging me... apparently dreaming about white snakes is a good thing, but I feel like in context the meaning can get pretty muddy (and even more confusing how it was originally a lizard before changing into a snake.) I'd appreciate some outsider insight to analyze it further.",1,1741108511.0,Dreams,3,1.0,False

I've been working for my father going on two years now. Prior to working for him I was a general manager at a well known Auto Body Repair Facility. I've worked my way up in the Automotive industry since 2020. Managed a coffee chain in 2018-2019, started working when I was 14.  When I started working for him it was VERY toxic because my older sister (39) could not deal with me giving her direction (I have more experience in this field) she tried to basically get me fired on numerous occasions. She would gaslight our dad and despite us having cameras and me giving him proof time and time again he never corrected her, or resolved the situation. I was going to quit but she ended up quitting before me so I stuck around.

My dad and I have always had somewhat of a strained relationship. My mother and him divorced when I was around 4 and I've only had somewhat of a relationship with him since 2019. (More than 10 years no contact after they divorced) He's not a great father to put it bluntly. He is narcissistic and blames everyone but himself for the majority of his problems. He can be very disrespectful at times and instead of communicating and trying to resolve issues with his kids (I am 1 of 4) he tries to give us money or shower us with material items. - This has never worked on me.

Point is, I've been ""managing"" his shops for a little over a year and it's an absolute nightmare. Anywhere I've ever worked or managed the higher ups NEVER get involved with a managers employees because it breaches chain of command. Anyone that's ever worked in this industry knows chain of command and communication is everything and it will mess up production if it is broken.  Nonetheless he continually gets involved or if I give an employee a task he will override it. This has affected everything to where my employees no longer see me as their boss but a facilitator or equal. I feel like I'm back at square one. Another issue is he has a serious woman problem. I KNOW ITS NOT MY BUSINESS! But I find it so disrespectful to have three, four, five women coming in the office every other day to ""see"" him. It's a bad look and especially a bad example for my little sister (she's 8) There have been times where these women would come in the office disgruntled threating me to tell them where his is!! I feel like no respectable man especially ""FATHER"" would behave this way.

Anyways I've talked to him about all these issues and spoke my concerns and he said he will change but it only gets worse or he stays the same. Needless to stay I'm struggling with the idea of sticking around with the ""hope"" that I may someday own the company or leaving to start my own business. These are my prime years and I feel like if I stay here I'll kill my potential. I've lost all my motivation to stay here and I talked to him about this and he keeps saying he's going to get a lawyer to do the paperwork but it never happens. I've put my own money into this company dedicated hours on hours to where I have no time for myself or my fianc√©, just to come to work and be belittled, disrespected and ignored. What would you do? PS thank you for reading my rant if you've made it this far. (PS part 2 - The pay is pretty good I make about 6 figures but I really don't care about the money, its about morals and taking care of myself mentally.) ",2,1741108334.0,careeradvice,6,1.0,False

Shonen characters when burn down the forest you take walks through? Comic characters ever total your car? Video Game Characters ever annihilate the planet you live on? Well, that's why I'm here! We price all the collateral us weak non-combatants have to go through. And today, we have an awesome season with a weird experiment, SEASON 8!

**RULES:**

1. Human lives cannot be measured in value. If you kill someone, you‚Äôre charged with time, not money. Therefore we will only be pricing inanimate objects and nature.
2. We‚Äôll only be counting onscreen damage caused by a combatant.¬†
3. This is for COLLATERAL DAMAGE, meaning it measures things which DON‚ÄôT BELONG to the combatants. Any weapons, armour or allies will not be charged unless they are not the property of the combatants.¬†
4. Combatants will only be charged for the collateral they cause. We‚Äôll charge both if it was vague on who did it or if it was a collective effort (If they chose to destroy a thrown object when they could have dodged).
5. Fixed damages will not be charged, even if it‚Äôs not explained how it was fixed.¬†
6. Unless otherwise specified, I‚Äôll assume every forest is protected land. Pricing things like trees and rocks is pretty hard so I‚Äôll be fining the character what I think are appropriate or average fines instead.
7. For continental destruction, because an entire country has never blown up in a single blast before, I‚Äôll say it would take five times their GDP when the episode came out to rebuild.
8. Cosmic destruction is subjective. You can‚Äôt really buy celestial objects. People have tried to calculate the value of Earth, so I‚Äôll use that number for all planets, multiplying when necessary.
9. Everything is subjective and there are different ways to measure things. I‚Äôll be rounding up and down numbers so take them with a grain of salt. Also, I‚Äôm Canadian, so there will be some conversions which might screw things up.¬†
10. If you have a better estimation for any of these or if I missed something, let me know and I‚Äôll be happy to redo them.

**THE FOLLOWING WILL NOT BE CHARGED FOR THESE REASONS:**

YODA VS MICKEY - I know nothing of Kingdom Hearts lore but from what I heard, this area should belong to Mickey. Like it‚Äôs literally part of his soul I think.¬†

AKUMA VS SHAO KAHN - Once again, Shao Kahn‚Äôs property.¬†

# AND NOW, IT'S TIME FOR A DEBT BATTLE!

**SHADOW VS RYUKO**

Starting off, Ryuko destroys some parts of the road. Hard to get an exact amount but I think a decent 50 feet squared will get us in the ballpark. Shadow also cracks some road (\~24.7). That amount also applies to Ryuko for her failed hit. She‚Äôll also get twice Shadow‚Äôs height in concrete (34.21). They both collective destroy a shit ton of road. Shadow‚Äôs long-awaited Chaos Blast will get him $50,000 in fines.

The average length of an intersection like this is 102 feet long. Altogether, that‚Äôs 10404 feet squared.¬†

Road 1 - ($20 x 50) = $1000 (RY)

Road 2 - ($20 x 24.7) = $494 (S)

Road 3 - ($20 x 24.7) =¬† $494 (RY)

Side Of Building - ($15 x 34.21) = $513.5 (RY)

Intersection - ($20 x 10404) = $208080 (S+RY)

Chaos Blast - $50,000 (S)

TOTAL:¬†**$260,581.5**. $106,047.5 from Ryuko and $154,534 from Shadow to the city.

**LEX VS DOOM**

Most of the fight doesn‚Äôt count as it takes place on Lex Corp property. That is until Lex takes it out of there to ruin some more road (\~67.23). And Doom outplays him with hand lasers hitting the ground. Assuming there‚Äôs 50 feet between them and Doom‚Äôs lasers extended about 3 feet across to start, that‚Äôs 150 feet squared of repaved roads.

Lex‚Äôs Impact ($20 x 67.23) = $1344.6

Doom‚Äôs Impact ($20 x 150) = $3000

TOTAL:¬†**$4344.6**¬†to Metropolis roads.¬†

LEX LUTHOR‚ÄôS TOTAL DEATH BATTLE BILL:¬†**$64,248,859,192.1**. Most of his bank account but he‚Äôll still be a billionaire.¬†

**HEIHACHI VS GEESE**

We‚Äôll start with the rock. Both cracked it, one more so than the other, but I‚Äôm willing to bill both $500 for it. It‚Äôs really hard to measure what Geese does next, but that shouldn‚Äôt matter, because the mountain starts to ERUPT! It‚Äôs unclear which attack specifically did this as it only happens when both really start to lock in, so it‚Äôll go to both. That makes them completely even‚Ä¶until Heihachi destroys a drone.

I‚Äôve priced mountains for being blown up or slashed, but never an eruption kickstarting. So, I‚Äôm going to price it at half what I usually price mountains, then half it again and give that to both combatants. Meanwhile, I found a drone online for $800.¬†

Rock - $1000 (G+H)

Mountain Eruption - $495,000,000 (G+H)

Drone - $800 (H)

TOTAL:¬†**$495,001,800.**¬†$24,751,300 from Heihachi and $24,750,500 from Geese to this mountain pass and Ringmaster.¬†

**BLAKE VS MIKASA**

Blake smashes Mikasa through two brick walls (\~25 x 2). Mikasa causes an explosion but there‚Äôs no impact. So just some bricks. I‚Äôll stick with the lower end for these.¬†

Brick Walls - ($10 x 50) = $500 (B)

TOTAL:¬†**$500**¬†from Blake to this random guy.¬†

**PO VS IRON FIST**

First off, both break off two bamboo sticks. Second off, the spirit realm.

Spirit Realm damages are ambiguous. It's hard to see impact so I'll assume it's mostly damages no one would mind.

That means it's just the bamboo sticks, which I found online for...12...dollars.

Bamboo ($12 x 2) = 24 (P1, I1)

TOTAL:¬†**$24**, $12 from each to Shifu‚Ä¶Proud to announce we have new record holders.¬†

**STEVEN VS STAR**

Sand is hard to price seeing as it isn‚Äôt really being destroyed, just repositioned. And destroying sand castles is rude but not something deemed lawsuit-worthy. That being said, Steven‚Äôs blast as Pink Steven does cause an actual fire in the sand, likely crystalizing it. I‚Äôll call that a $10,000 fine. Star will also get this for the killing blow.

Beach Fines - ($10,000 x 2) = $20,000 (S1, S1)

TOTAL:¬†**$20,000.**¬†$10,000 from each to this beach.

**LINK VS CLOUD**

POT TIME! Link destroys three pots. And the church explosion. I‚Äôm going to place that explosion all on both. Link for supercharging Cloud and for the damages he‚Äôll do later as Fierce Diety, and Cloud for actually causing the explosion.¬†

Clay vases like these seem to fluctuate between $40 and $150, so to get an average, I‚Äôll say each pot costs $100. Meanwhile, I found out that a church made of this much concrete would cost about 3 million to build on average.

Pots - ($100 x 3) = $300 (L)

Church - $3,000,000 (L+C)

TOTAL:¬†**$3,000,300**. $1,500,300 from Link and $1,500,000 from Cloud to this church.¬†

**BATMAN VS IRON MAN**

In most continuities and from how it‚Äôs presented, Wayne Enterprises funds the Watchtower. Why else would Tony ask him directly? So that‚Äôs not going to be charged.¬†

Anyways, once this fight leaves space, Bruce drops Tony‚Äôs robotic suit onto that fucking car again. Whoever owns it has to be a millionaire from all these lawsuits by now. He also destroys a shit ton of the road and at least one building. Eyeballing it, I‚Äôll say the impact is about twice the size of the Shadow VS Ryuko intersection, so 41616 feet squared. He also busts the Godbuster through its height in brick walls (\~30). And that awesome fucking bat shot, assuming each is also Tony‚Äôs height, going to be about 80 feet squared each, and times four.¬†

Of course, Tony‚Äôs not losing any monetary competition to Bruce. The Dyson Sphere incinerates seven cars, at least one regular house, six smaller buildings, six larger buildings and I‚Äôm going to estimate twice the amount Bruce did with his impact just from eyeballing it.

Because this is a more modern city, I‚Äôm pumping bricks to about $20 per square foot, the maxium. I‚Äôm going to assume every smaller building here is 1/4 the price of where I usually put skyscrapers, and your average modern house costs $419,200.¬†

Cars - ($35,000 x 8) = $280,000 (B1, T7)

Bruce‚Äôs Impact - ($20 x 41616) = $832,320 (B)

Walls - (($20 x 30) x 4) = $2400 (B)

Smaller Buildings - ($125,000,000 x 7) = $875,000,000 (B1, T6)

Larger Buildings - ($5,000,000,000 x 6) = $30,00,000,000 (T)

House - $419,200 (T)

Tony‚Äôs Impact ($20 x 83232) = $1,664,640 (T)

TOTAL:¬†**$3,878,198,560.**¬†$125,869,520 from Batman and $3,752,328,840 from Iron Man to this city. Still less expensive than the Batmobile.

BATMAN‚ÄôS TOTAL DEATH BATTLE BILL:¬†**$125,917,640.**¬†Not with his cosmic teammates but it‚Äôs still something.¬†

IRON MAN‚ÄôS TOTAL DEATH BATTLE BILL:¬†**$69,468,236,687.5.**¬†Most of it‚Äôs to his wife though.¬†

**MACHO-MAN VS KOOL-AID MAN**

Both are hard to see, but Kool-Aid Man breaks through a wall as an entrance, meanwhile Macho Man breaks him through three trees. Pretty simple.¬†

It‚Äôs impossible to see the full size of this brick wall, so I‚Äôm going to stick to the price I use when a full brick wall is smashed through instead of when it‚Äôs cracked or it‚Äôs just a small impact. That‚Äôs $5000. Meanwhile, I‚Äôll assume each tree is a $1000 fine.¬†

Wall - $5000 (K)

Trees - ($1000 x 3) = $3000 (M)

TOTAL:¬†**$8000**. Obvious who‚Äôs who.

**DIO VS ALUCARD**¬†

Alucard starts off the battle by totalling whatever poor sap Dio chose to drive him. Dio breaks several glass panes in stopped time. And the ROAD ROLLER, taking size into account, cracks around 850 square feet of cobblestone, though that‚Äôs both estimated and rounded up.¬†

Alucard‚Äôs blood flood is a hard one. It likely caused some damage but we can‚Äôt tell how far it extended and what it actually might‚Äôve hurt, so I‚Äôm not going to go into specifics for that. Same goes for the clock tower explosion. Both of them ruin the tower‚Äôs handles though. I‚Äôll bill Dio a final 10 square feet of cobblestone.¬†

I‚Äôm not a car expert and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be corrected on this but that seems to be similar to a Ford Model 48, the average price for sale online for them is around $40,000 and seeing as the Road Roller is there, this battle should take place around the 80s so I‚Äôm sticking to its modern price. Also, the Road Roller that large should cost $120,000 or higher, but it isn‚Äôt completely totalled so I‚Äôll put it there.¬†

For the windows, I counted four small ones, four medium ones, and three longer ones.¬†

Finally, the clock hands. I can‚Äôt really tell how much it would cost to build those, I have no point of reference. But they aren‚Äôt completely broken, they just need to be placed back on the clock, which would mean the bill would come from labour, but I have no point of reference for how many people it would take, their rate or how long it would take. So‚Ä¶Forgive me, I‚Äôll just bill both $50,000. If you know anything about clock towers, feel free to give me a better price.¬†

Car - $40,000 (A)

Small Glass - ($260 x 4) = $1040 (D)

Medium Glass - ($550 x 4) = $2200 (D)

Long Glass - ($300 x 3) = $900 (D)

Road Roller - $120,000 (D)

Cobblestone 1 - ($25 x 850) = $21,250 (D)

Hour hand - $50,000 (D)

Minute hand - $50,000 (A)

Cobblestone 2 - ($25 x 10) = $250 (D)

TOTAL:¬†**$285,640.**¬†$195,640 from Dio and $90,000 from Alucard to this town.¬†

**KORRA VS STORM**

I‚Äôm not gonna bill any of the ice or glaciers. I doubt anyone actually owns this island or any law would get upset with you if you broke it. I am going to bill those cars though, and assume they‚Äôre similar in price to the ones I just did. And for the two giant rocks in the spirit realm, it's vague how much this would actually be charged for because again, afterlife. So I'll bill $10,000 each. Also, Cabbage Guy gets to sue someone again, this time Storm.

Cars - ($40,000 x 2) = $80,000 (K)

Rocks - ($10,000 x 2) = $20,000 (K)

Cabbage Cart ($500 + $26.46) = $526.46 (S)

TOTAL:¬†**$60,526.46**. $60,000 from Korra and $526.46 from Storm to some alive guys and dead guys.

**MADARA VS AIZEN**

The first thing broken by these two combatants that isn‚Äôt one of their own attacks is the giant meteor Madara summons and Aizen destroys. Measuring it is impossible, so, based on vibes, I‚Äôll assume it‚Äôs a similar size to what Thor destroyed against Wonder Woman. Around 3.14 km2. The smaller ones are actually easier to price, being closer to the size of the Perfect Susanoo. Assuming his height is their diameter, the meteors should be about 0.18 Km2. It‚Äôs bigger than it sounds and will be a lot run through my shakey cosmic destruction formula and rounded up.¬†¬†

Big Meteor - ($9,808,917 x 3.14) = $30,800,000 (A)

Small Meteors - (($9,808,917 x 0.18) x 2) = $3,540,000 (M1, A1)

TOTAL:¬†**$34,340,000**. $1,770,000 for Madara and $32,570,000 to Aizen to‚Ä¶meteor owners, I guess.¬†

**SAITAMA VS POPEYE**

The hardest part of this is not the cosmic destruction, it's the goddamn grocery store. I really don‚Äôt want to go frame-by-frame for this and count literally every. Plus, not all of this is broken. Some of it just needs to be restocked. I‚Äôm going to put a pin in this, I‚Äôm kinda interested.¬†

And while he did fix the likely concrete wall, there‚Äôs still a Saitama-shaped hole in it. (\~42). Ending our street-level portion of the fight is a‚Ä¶street. The shopping district to be exact and I can‚Äôt really calculate this part because a lot of the destruction is vague and it‚Äôs hard to see where it ends. So we‚Äôll assume they both just got sued for around $200,000 each.¬†

The chunk of earth Saitama punches Popeye through seems to be as long in diameter as Japan, which is about 3000 km. That means it‚Äôs around 21,205,800 km2 following hemisphere formulas and will be judged like it‚Äôs a meteor.

Following that formula as well will be Mars, broken by Popeye, and Pluto, broken by Saitama. Both The Sun and The Universe are exempt from this as they appear to both be repaired once the battle ends. Maybe next time.¬†

This won‚Äôt dent the pricing of this battle but let‚Äôs talk about the grocery store. The average amount a clerk makes in Japan is 8.03 an hour. Assuming it took four people an entire workday (8 hours each) to clean Popeye‚Äôs mess, that‚Äôs $257, plus they lost a day of business, which is an average of $3,300 in daily revenue.¬†

Also a grocery store fridge costs bout $2,800.¬†

Grocery Store Lawsuit - $3,557 (P)

Fridge - $2,800 (P)

Saitama hole - ($15 x 42) = $630 (P)

Shopping District Lawsuit - $400,000 (S+P)

Chunk Of Earth - ($9,808,917 x 21,205,800) = $208,005,930,000,000 (S)

Mars - ($9,808,917 x 144,400,000) = $1,416,407,600,000,000 (P)

Pluto - ($9,808,917 x 17,744,430) = $174,053,640,000,000 (S)

TOTAL:¬†**$1,798,467,200,400,000.**¬†$382,059,570,200,000 from Saitama and $1,416,407,600,206,987 from Popeye to some store owners and gods.¬†

*AND NOW, THE MOST EXPENSIVE EPISODE OF SEASON 8 IS‚Ä¶*

**GOKU BLACK VS REVERSE-FLASH**

Let‚Äôs break this down. The coffee mug Eobard broke was Goku Black‚Äôs property, so no charging. But the windows belonged to the city, so yes charging. I‚Äôll assume they were five man-sized windows. And Zamasu isn‚Äôt getting a detailed breakdown.

‚ÄúBut Alexander, didn‚Äôt Goku Black Who Is Not Black ruin some of the street, a building and part of the moon!‚Äù

Well, yes, but here‚Äôs the thing. To start with the moon, there‚Äôs no impact, so I can‚Äôt get a frame of reference for how much he actually destroyed. But yes, he did break a building‚Ä¶every single building, and street and car and thing and person in the city. And despite the time travel, that shit stuck. So, assuming it‚Äôs as expensive as repairing New York‚Äôs been estimated to be, that‚Äôs Ten Trillion Dollars!

And immediately it‚Äôs overshadowed by the sun blowing up. Another $1e37 to comic book heralds.¬†

Windows - ($2,678 x 5) = $13,390 (RF)

City - $10,000,000,000,000 (GB)

Sun - $1e37 (RF)

TOTAL:¬†**$10,000,000,013,410 (+1e37.)**¬†Obvious who‚Äôs who.¬†

This post contains spoilers for [A Manga About High School Boys Who Woke Up As Girls One Morning](https://mahoushoujobu.com/read/manga/Boys-WUGOM/). Up until and including the end of chapter 6, to be exact. 

Now, as you can guess from the title, this is one of those mangas that explores the idea of switching genders without explicitly mentioning transgender people. Stories like this run the risk of only satisfying the short-term needs of people who don't know they are transgender yet without actually helping them in the long-term, in extreme cases even giving them misleading ideas about what their feelings might actually mean. 

The story begins with the god of Mt. Gachiyuri turning the three highschool boys Satou, Suzuki, and Takahashi into girls because he is a [quasilesbian](https://lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Harmful_Terminology) man-hater. However, this ""ONLY AFFECTS THOSE WHO WANT TO BE A GIRL"", and, indeed, all three immediately start dressing feminine. Suzuki had already been enjoying secretly wearing women's clothes on a regular basis and Takahashi wanted to be a girl since he was little so they both quickly accept their new genders. Satou has always looked kinda feminine but he's trying to change back despite enjoying wearing her younger sister's clothes in front of the mirror but then uses an excuse to wear them anyway. So far, this all seems like a transgender allegory, similar to [Tensei Pandemic](https://mangadex.org/title/d4c2d0ec-03ce-4f18-81a7-93cffb7e74f5/tensei-pandemic). Plenty of mangas like this feature people trying to change back until they eventually [embrace their new genders](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondLawOfGenderBending). Not this manga though. Turns out ""THOSE WHO WANT TO BE A GIRL"" was meant literally: Any reason why a guy would want to be a girl counts. 

After failing to turn back into guys, the three MtFs find out that their school's principal and vice principal were also turned into girls and agree to arrange the three students new identities. However, they weren't just turned into their own genderswapped selves: The principal became a little girl because his 5-year-old granddaughter didn't wanna play with him and the vice principal became a tanned gyaru because he ""WANTED TO CARE ABOUT FELLOW STUDENTS WHILE ALSO BEING A STUDENT"". To switch back, you have to ""THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO ONCE YOU TURN BACK INTO A MAN AGAIN AND WISH TO BE A MAN AGAIN FROM THE BOTTOM OF YOUR HEART"". And then Itou, another student from the same class, also turns into a girl because he was bullied by his classmates and the teachers for liking cute things. 

Meanwhile, Satou starts warming up to being treated as [""AMAZINGLY CUTE""](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractiveBentGender) by everyone, including her own family. And the coach is so ""LENIENT WITH GIRLS"" that he not only lets her play soccer with the boys but even allows her to foul everyone! But then he thinks that Iokibe, his childhood friend, loves him and this makes him love her back so he confesses his love to her but she rejects him. With tears in his eyes, she then says: ""I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. YOU GUYS WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG. THERE'S NOTHING GOOD ABOUT BECOMING MEN AGAIN. **IF IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE THIS, I'D RATHER ENJOY A LIFE SHOWERED WITH PEOPLE'S ATTENTION AS A PRETTY GIRL! AHAHAHA! I'M NEVER GOING BACK TO BEING A MAN! GODDAMMIT!!**"" 

This quote speaks right from my soul. I've also wanted to be a girl since I was little and I also can't think of a single reason for switching back, especially now that my family accepts me and my name has been changed everywhere. Physical strength? No, I don't wanna go back to accidentally hurting those I care about. Safety in dark alleys? I've always been the weakest pupil in my mixed-gender class and I've always gotten beat up a lot. Safety from transphobia? I've always been bullied for my feminine behavior. Independence from medications? I also take antidepressants and vitamin supplements. Male privilege? I used to feel guilty for having it. Emotional stability? My mom used to call me robotic and I don't really wanna go back to this. Not freezing anymore? I've always gotten sick all the time. Coffee tolerance? I don't drink coffee. Alcohol tolerance? I don't drink alcohol either. Ever since I've come out, I've felt happier and more comfortable in my body and less guilty, everyone has been nicer to me and complimenting me on my looks, there are fewer misunderstandings, and life's overall just been easier for me. And I still believe life would've been better for me had I been born cis. Even when I die, I want a female name on my tombstone because I want to be seen and remembered as female. I will never ever ""WISH TO BE A MAN AGAIN FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. 

But this manga depicts those desires as having underlying reasons. That AMABs would stop wanting to be girls once those reasons no longer apply. The vice president has already switched back. The president will most likely switch back if he plays with his granddaughter. And Itou has been hinted to also have another underlying reason that hasn't been fulfilled yet. Even Satou's situation is clearly a misunderstanding that will probably get resolved eventually. But Satou doesn't know that. Noone has ever fallen in love with me as a guy so, from her perspective, her and my situation are pretty much the same, yet her decision to stay female is depicted as sad and unhealthy, like the audience is supposed to disagree with him, especially that laughter. I fear that every MtF in the story is gonna turn back in the end. I want at least one of them to stay female forever. Like Takahashi, for example. She wanted to be a girl since she was little, has a lot of experience with makeup and feminine clothes, and the seal of the god might also have some meaning to it. 

..........Sorry for the vent. This is a transgender subreddit so I already know that you'll all say that I made the right decision. Noone has ever told me to detransition and I already know that you won't either. So I have absolutely no reason to regret my transition, let alone detransition. But this manga...well...it makes my transition look like a sad ending, as opposed to a happy ending. Like I never really got closure, you know? Like I wanted to get AWAY from my AGAB more than I wanted to get TOWARDS my target gender. I dress and behave stereotypically feminine but I feel like I do that mostly because I still fear being seen as male again, especially by people who know that I'm trans. I still remember my pre-transition past: 

* the times when the boys beat me up for behaving feminine 

* the times when the girls mockingly dangled all the things in front of my face they knew I wanted but couldn't have because of my gender 

* the times I was excluded from Girls' Day 

* the times I was forced into the boys' bathroom that was always broken and extremely dirty and always lacked toilet paper 

* the guilt of being born into a gender known for systematically oppressing another one 

* the TV shows reinforcing stereotypes against both men and women while also making transphobic jokes 

* the physical changes of puberty I never wanted but felt like I had to accept 

* the times I was forced to sleep with the boys 

* the times I was forced to undress in front of the boys 

* the times I was forced to go swimming bare-chested in front of everyone

* the times my barber kept systematically mutilating a perfectly healthy part of me to make sure it never grows back and I had to thank him and pay him for it 

* the time I won the last prize of my school's BINGO tournament but had to give it away because it was a product for girls 

* the time my mom made me dispose of my collection of fake fingernails in all colors that I was planning to wear in secret 

* the times I was enjoying something I like, only to later find out that I would have to hide it because it's for girls 

* the horrifying fear of having to join the military one day, as punishment for the unforgivable crime of having been born male 

* the feeling of being inside a cruel joke after hearing that women live longer than men 

* the times when guys used ""girl"" as an insult and I felt like I couldn't speak out against it and the girls were either absent or okay with it 

* the guilt over desiring to look and dress feminine because I thought those desires make me a pervert 

* the time when someone pressed a vibrating phone against my head and I screamed because I thought it was a razor and then everyone laughed 

* the debilitating fear of being seen with the color pink, despite being such a beautiful color 

* the times seeing supermodels and stewardesses and pornstars and strippers and poledancers and whatnot, thinking those career paths would always be closed to me because I'm male 

It all still feels so present. And noone ever apologized to me for any of this because there were supposedly no signs. I don't feel happy because it's all over, I feel sad because it all happened. I don't feel content in being female, I still feel like I never wanna go back to being male. I still feel like I haven't recovered from all of this. I still get nightmares from my time at school. I still cry when I look through my old documents documenting these incidents. I'm so traumatized that I can't tell how I would've felt growing up in a postgenderist society, let alone a society where gender roles are reversed, because I'm simply unable to imagine myself unaffected by gender after being hit on the head with it for literally as far as I can remember. I just wish...it never happened! The social construct of the female gender doesn't bring me happiness, it brings me...relief. It calms me down. And, before you ask, no, I am definitely not non-binary. I checked. 

*""What doesn't kill you...leaves you traumatized and needing lifelong therapy."" --me* 

Do you know what I mean? Can you relate to my feelings? Will I ever get over it? Will I ever come to peace? Will I ever feel secure in my femininity? Will I ever be...[content](https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/transincidental/content/viewer?title_no=605328&episode_no=66)?",6,1741107690.0,asktransgender,2,0.88,False

1j3fhzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/1j3fhzz/just_did_1021_miles_in_one_long_day_tampa_fl_to/,"Just did 1,021 miles in one long day [Tampa, FL to central PA] = Tips and tricks for long hauls + AMA","Had to go to FL for a work event and that pretty much necessitated I boomerang down and back.  The trip down was a 14hr day with me logging just over 800 miles.  After the event I went deeper into FL which made my return trip just over 1,000 miles which equated to 18 hours.

**Tip #1: Leave early; stop early** - My usually preference is to leave as early as I can (*usually before the sun is up*) and do the bulk of my driving during the day.  This does a couple of things.  First, you can usually leave early enough to miss morning commuter traffic as well as morning buses.  Secondly, you're driving in the day when you're fresh and awake and then when it starts getting dark you're close to stopping for the day.

**Tip #2: Stop often** - Roadtrips are usually destination focused and as drivers were just trying to get there *ASAP.* The downside can be when you push yourself too hard too long and make things worse.  It's a marathon, not a sprint.  Also, stopping frequently means you can stretch and walk around a lot which mitigates blood clots from forming in your feet/legs.  Also, breaks up the mental fatigue of focusing on the road for too long -- especially dawn/dusk/night with headlights.  I'll get bad eye strain if I drive too much at night (*getting old sucks*).

**Tip #3: Audio Books/Podcasts** - I have found, over the years, that when I do longer trips the best thing for me to listen to on the highway is an audio book.  This year I had two 16+ hour unabridged books and they helped so much.  It not only makes the time feel like it passes faster, but it also mitigates my road rage.  Hit bad traffic?  Oh, darn, I can hear my book better.  FWIW I do switch to music on surface streets so I can better focus on directions and don't feel like I'm missing out on the book.  But for that long 210 mile stretch before my next pit stop? = Book time

**Tip #4: WATER** - All the caffeinated drinks in the world are not enough to keep you awake and alert.  You need water.  You body needs water. Your brain needs water.  You stomach needs water.  If all you do is hook up an IV drip of coffee or soda and skip water you will crash -- metaphorically and literally.  I cannot stress how important it is to balance water intake in parallel to caffeine drinks.  I usually have one large yeti mug with tea or Mountain Dew and a second one of just water.  Once once is empty I switch to the other.  It has helped so much over just mindlessly pounding caffeinated drinks.  Also, along these lines, avoid ""energy drinks.""  Since you're just sitting still driving you don't need all the extra crap in the energy drink.  As such if you sit there and pound monsters/redbulls/pre-workouts/etc you're just going to make yourself into an anxious asshole behind the wheel.  This is a prefect instance of when ""less is more."" Less caffeine + more water = longer drive time

**Tip #5: Hit the gym** - Driving is a physical activity.  It's also a mental one.  Hitting the gym and doing both upper and lower body workouts, as well as some stamina building cardio is only going to help with long drives.  I have a trainer I do upper and lower body work with and I swim 2-3 times a week which also hits my upper body.  1,000 miles in one day is no small feat and there is no way I could do it if I wasn't working out on a weekly basis.

**Tip #6: Spreadsheets** - If you're trying to do a long drive it doesn't hurt to map your route out and pre-mark things like fuel stops.  I have a spreadsheet set up so when I do a long-distance drive I know when, where, and from whom I am getting fuel.  Most all major brands have searchable maps with their locations.  My go-to for on-highway trips is Love's.  Their bathrooms are usually clean, they always have fuel, and they usually have some soft of fast food chain in them.  You can also use the ""search along route"" feature in something like Google or Apple Maps to find gas stations.  You can also use something like the GasBuddy website to estimate costs ahead of times looking at state/regional gas prices.  Now, all this said, do not feel beholden to your spreadsheet.  Mine often end up as a rough guideline for estimating costs and they always end up changing some.  I still track actual costs along with my estimates for a feel of how much

**Tip #7: Stop and smell the roses** - I know I said ""stop often"" already, but this last one takes that a little deeper.  As I mention road-trips tend to be very destination oriented.  What happens is we end up passing so many cool places along the way.  Cannot stress how fun it is to budget an hour or so each day to stop and enjoy a site along the way.  Could be a scenic overlook.  Could be a museum.  Could just be a cool local store or tourist trap (*Bucee's, South of the Border, etc*).  Stops like this go a long way in giving your mind and body time to rest and reset before jumping back on the road.

At any rate, I routinely drive long drives like this.  I also drive professionally part-time.  This year alone I will be as far south as FL and as far west as AZ with dozens of trips in-between.  Feel free to **AMA** about roadtripping in the USA.",9,1741107580.0,roadtrip,1,0.85,False

I‚Äôm worried my [F28] husband [M29] might become Mormon.,"It stated four months ago when my husband mentioned that he saw on Tik Tok that Mormons believe Garden Of Eden was actually in Missouri. We laughed about it, and he went on a bit of a rabbit hole with Mormonism. Everyday he would find some new Mormon fact and laugh about it.
Soon he started watching Mormon bloggers, including ex-Mormons. 

Somehow watching ex- Mormon content made him more pro Mormon, something about them being ungrateful and over dramatic about minor negative experiences being worse than they actually were.

Now he keeps wanting to go visit Utah and been bringing up eventually moving to Utah. Keeps joking that we should convert to Mormonism. I can‚Äôt even tell if he is joking anymore. He says he doesn‚Äôt believe in the tenants of Mormonism, but Mormons seem like such nice people to live around and he loves the culture.

He keeps trying to get me to go to the Mormon temple with him, we haven‚Äôt gone since closest one is two hours away. I‚Äôm afraid of what might happen if we actually go.

Another silly minor thing is he hates coffee and drinks a lot of soda and is obsessed with how they have soda cafes in UTAH. And it‚Äôs another sign for him that Mormonism is great. 

I am afraid if this keeps going on and on he will end up actually trying to convert and become a Mormonism. This is something I‚Äôm NOT interested in.

How should I approach this sensitively. 
Whenever i bring up that I‚Äôm worried about him becoming Mormon he says I have nothing to worry about because Mormonism is great‚Ä¶

Process so far has been recoding in zoom, taking the audio file and editing in audacity or audition. 

I also occasionaly film coffee chats/panel discussions which are essentially 4 person zoom calls where the video has been edited to look more presentable in frames etc. So it would be good to have good video recording capabilities, but this is a secondary priority

On initial inspection of replacement platforms with better audio quality Zencaster and Riverside fm seem to be the leaders, but also seem to come with their own editing softwares.  
  
My questions are:   
1: Which platform would you reccomend switching to for best quality, reliability and ease of use?

2: Are the in-platform editing softwares worth it? And are they simple to use? (wouldn't take much to be a step up from audacity i know) 

3: Are their cheaper versions that just offer the improved recording capabilities and reliability, without the in-platform editing. ",1,1741107528.0,podcasting,2,1.0,False

When I freeze things like stock, leftover coffee, etc. I'll often use them because I already have them rather than going out and buying ice cube trays. But that means some of the stuff in my freezer is in 'odd' shapes, puzzle pieces, hearts, candy bars, skulls, whatever I happened to grab. 

Had a friend over last night and when she went to get something out of the freezer, she noticed the containers of shaped frozen stuff and made a comment like 'what, are you an ice influencer now?' She was joking but we started talking about them and man, I did not know the depths of this! I'd seen a video or two of people making fancy ice but I'd *never* seen some of the stuff she showed me. Whole freezers just for ice. People with dozens of different molds for every holiday and season and theme. People with freezers full of ice *plus* 2 or 3 counter top ice makers on top of it. Adding glitter and flowers and food coloring and god knows what else to ice just to then put it in their Stanley cups where you can't see it anyway. And of course every mold and container and scoop and cup they use is linked in their Amazon storefront so you don't have to worry about your ice being off-trend.

And on top of all that, apparently when tiktok was going to be banned a bunch of these influencers came out and said they never used the ice! They'd make the videos then dump it all so they could put their actual food back in the freezer.

The tires crunched over snow as we rounded the final bend, the cabin coming into view just as the sun dipped behind the mountains. It looked exactly like the pictures‚Äîquaint, tucked into the trees that picturesquely hid a roof that needed replacing. The kind of place someone more optimistic might describe as ‚Äúcharming.‚Äù I wanted it to feel charming. I wanted Claire to see it that way too.

‚ÄúHere we are,‚Äù I said, forcing a little enthusiasm into my voice as I pulled into the narrow driveway.

Claire didn‚Äôt respond. She was staring at her phone, thumb scrolling slowly, her face bathed in the faint blue glow.

‚ÄúLooks nice, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù I tried again, louder this time.

She glanced up, eyes flicking to the cabin, then back to her screen. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù she murmured.

I killed the engine and sat for a moment, gripping the steering wheel. Fine. Of course it was fine. That‚Äôs how everything was with us these days. Just fine.

The wind picked up as I stepped out of the car, sharp and bitter against my face. The sky hung low and heavy, the snow swirling in lazy drifts that would soon grow into something heavier. 

I turned, taking in my surroundings. The cabin sat perched on the mountainside, the winding road we'd taken visible below, snaking through the trees like a thin, fragile thread. The road had split and veered back toward town a quarter mile before, leaving only a slick, cobbled driveway behind. For the first time in months, there was no sound of traffic-no hum of engines or distant voices. Just the wind, growing louder by the second, and the soft, eerie hush of falling snow. The kind of quiet that presses in on you, suffocating, until you're not sure whether it's the world holding its breath or you.

I looked back at Claire, still sitting in the passenger seat. She‚Äôd finally looked up from her phone and seemed to really be taking in the cabin. For a second I was hopeful that she was excited to be here, but I quickly realized her face was washed with a vague disdain for the building.

‚ÄúCan you grab your bags?‚Äù I asked, leaning back in the door.

She sighed‚Äîa little too loudly‚Äîand climbed out, shivering as she zipped her coat and put her phone in her pocket. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs freezing.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs December in Colorado,‚Äù I said, trying for humor. ‚ÄúWhat did you expect?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt laugh.

The cabin door resisted when I pushed it open, the wood swollen and warped from years of wear and weather. Inside, the cabin smelled faintly of pine and something musty, the dull damp scent reminding me of our little apartment back home. The floors groaned underfoot as I stepped in, the sound muffled by faded rugs and soft wood. A stone fireplace dominated the far wall, and a small kitchen sat off to the left, its appliances outdated but at least appearing functional. To our right, a narrow hallway with two doors and a pull-down attic string seemed to be the way to our bathroom and bedroom. Generic framed paintings and kitschy souvenirs adorned the hall, gathering dust. Telltale signs of a home that had been long delegated to live out its days as a holiday rental.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cozy,‚Äù I said, setting our bags down by the door.

Claire brushed past me without a word, heading straight for the couch. She dropped onto it, pulling her phone out again and scrolling as if it were the only thing keeping her tethered to the world. At least she looked comfortable to finally be out of the car. 

I sighed, my breath puffing out in the chilly air as I set our bags down. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get the fire going.‚Äù

The fireplace was old, caked in soot, and looked like it probably hadn‚Äôt passed an inspection in decades, but there was a neat stack of logs and kindling waiting beside it. I knelt down, striking a few damp matches until one finally lit, and coaxed a flame to life. Warmth crept into the room as the fire caught, long shadows dancing across the wooden walls.

‚ÄúBetter?‚Äù I asked, glancing at Claire.

She looked up, and flashed me a curt smile and nod before burying herself again in her phone. I found myself soured at the realization that her signal here must somehow be decent enough to keep endlessly scrolling.

I busied myself unpacking, the silence between us growing heavier with each passing minute. The snow had started falling harder now, the wind rattling the windows. The cabin groaned softly, the sound deep and patient, like a long-held sigh. I paused, listening, but it was just the home shifting under the slowly increasing burden of the snow on the roof.

‚ÄúAt least this place has some character,‚Äù I said, trying to break the silence.

Claire didn‚Äôt respond.

I sat down next to her, rubbing my hands together as I tried to ignore the vague dampness of the couch. ‚ÄúLook, Claire, I know this trip isn‚Äôt exactly your idea of relaxing, but I thought‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired,‚Äù she cut in, standing abruptly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúClaire‚Ä¶‚Äù

She was already walking down the hall, her footsteps sharp against the creaky floorboards. A door shut, and I was left alone with the fire and the sound of the growing storm outside. 

I leaned back, staring at the dancing flames. I pulled a blanket out of one of my bags, and was relieved to find that the couch reclined. 

‚ÄúMaybe it would be best if you slept on the couch tonight.‚Äù

Claire‚Äôs words from days prior rattled through my head. It hadn‚Äôt just been that night- we hadn‚Äôt slept in the same room since. I had hoped that would change tonight, but I resigned myself to fall asleep by the crackling fire.

 The cabin let out another low groan, the sound making the hairs on the back of my neck prickle.
I looked out the window once more, and realized that the growing storm had become a blizzard. Cold air blew in through the crack under the front door, and I could tell my car wasn‚Äôt moving anytime soon. 

It was going to be a long night.

-

Morning crept in slowly, the storm outside reduced to a dull whisper of snow against the windows. The fire had died overnight, leaving the cabin bitterly cold. I dragged myself off the couch and pulled on a sweatshirt, shivering as I walked into the kitchen.

Claire was already up, sitting at the small table by the window, her coffee mug sitting in front of her on the table, untouched. She wasn‚Äôt looking at her phone, which felt like progress, but her eyes were fixed on the snow-covered trees outside. Her head was tilted towards the hallway, as though she were listening for me coming.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù I said, grabbing the remaining chipped mug from the counter.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù she replied quietly, not turning to look at me.

I poured myself some coffee, the pot nearly cold since she‚Äôd made it. She must‚Äôve been up for hours. 

‚ÄúThe storm looks like it‚Äôs easing up,‚Äù I said, leaning against the counter. ‚ÄúMaybe we could take a walk later? Get some fresh air.‚Äù

She made a vague noise of hesitant agreement, but her body language was closed off‚Äîlegs tucked under her, shoulders hunched. It wasn‚Äôt outright hostility, but it wasn‚Äôt exactly welcoming either.

I watched her for a moment, my coffee growing colder in my hands. I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from thinking about the things she‚Äôd said to me during our last fight, words that had settled into me like splinters. 

‚ÄúIf you want to book that stupid anniversary trip, go right ahead. You just bulldoze ahead like what you want is the only thing that matters.‚Äù

I took a deep breath and turned away, sipping my coffee.

That‚Äôs when I heard it‚Äîa faint sound, just on the edge of my perception.

I froze, tilting my head toward the hallway. It was so faint that I couldn‚Äôt be sure I wasn‚Äôt imagining it, like the hum of an appliance or a distant murmur muffled through walls.

‚ÄúYou hear that?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúHear what?‚Äù Claire‚Äôs voice sounded annoyed, but she glanced over her shoulder towards the hallway as well.

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, a noise. It sounds like‚Ä¶ talking? Singing, maybe?‚Äù

She frowned. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably the wind.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I muttered. 

We finished up our coffee, and put our mugs in the sink. We‚Äôd long fallen out of our habit of washing dishes together, and there wasn‚Äôt a dishwasher in sight. 

As I began to slip on my boots, Claire slowly shambled to the bedroom, with no indication that she‚Äôd be getting dressed for our walk. 

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to join me, honey? The storm‚Äôs clearing up, it‚Äôll be nice to get out of here for a bit.‚Äù

There was a moment of silence and I thought she would ignore me once more, but after a moment, her voice mumbled through the cracked bedroom door.

‚ÄúThis trip will be a lot easier for the both of us if we don‚Äôt have to pretend. Go on your walk, I‚Äôll be here on my phone.‚Äù

My anger finally burst forth, having been restrained in an attempt to salvage this trip.

‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm the one making this harder than it has to be? You‚Äôre impossible to talk to, Claire.‚Äù I shouted towards the door. 

I heard her stand, feet shuffling towards the bedroom door, and it slammed shut. The house groaned in response, then settled, and once more the silence was swallowed up by the faint murmuring noise coming from the hallway.

-

The noise didn‚Äôt go away. As the day went on, it remained at the edge of my awareness, faint but persistent. I tried to ignore it, chalking it up to maybe wind blowing through a hole in the roof, or perhaps even a small animal seeking shelter from the cold. It made me uneasy. There was a familiarity to the noise that I couldn‚Äôt place.

We ate dinner in near silence, the tension between us heavy enough to fill the small kitchen. Claire pushed her canned pasta around her plate, barely eating.

‚ÄúIs it bothering you?‚Äù I asked finally.

She looked up, startled that I‚Äôd broken the quiet.

‚ÄúIs what bothering me?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe noise. I thought maybe‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hear anything,‚Äù she said quickly, cutting me off.

I opened my mouth to argue, but stopped myself. I‚Äôd learned by now not to tell her when I thought she was wrong about something. Instead, I finished my meal in silence, the faint static prickling at the edge of my hearing.

It wasn‚Äôt until we were piling our dishes in the sink when the cold wind stopped entirely for the first time since our arrival, and the sound was louder than it had ever been. 

Claire turned her head towards the hallway, and I grinned.

‚ÄúSo you do hear it!‚Äù I‚Äôll admit I was a little smug when she rolled her eyes at me. 

‚ÄúFine I hear it. But it‚Äôs nothing, just this stupid old cabin falling apart.‚Äù

Claire turned to walk towards the hallway, and I began to walk towards my makeshift bed on the couch when she turned towards me, sighed, and gestured for me to join her in the bedroom.

I happily took my blanket from the couch, and finally went to bed with a little warmth.

-

As I fell asleep, I dreamt of our wedding day. It‚Äôs ironic, on a trip that was intended to celebrate our fifth anniversary, it was the first time my wedding had even crossed my mind.

I dreamt I was at the altar, holding hands with my wife. Her palms felt cold and clammy in my own, and she looked upset. I looked at her, trying to imagine a future in which we could be happy, but her scowl burnt holes through my hope. 

As the minister began to conclude the ceremony and asked if anyone in the crowd held objections, a voice rang from the audience. I turned towards the crowd, and was shocked to see Claire- or yet, another Claire. She was dressed comfortably, in the sweater she‚Äôd worn on our first date. She looked radiant, smiling like how she used to, and was eagerly trying to get my attention. 

‚ÄúJason! Jason I love you! Come here, come to me please! Don‚Äôt do this!‚Äù She cried, as though it were of utmost urgency. 

I turned back to my bride to be, and was taken aback to find her withering before me. Her skin sallowed and stretched tight over her bones, her rosy cheeks deflating and her eyes growing darker. I couldn‚Äôt look away as she guided my hand to her side, wet with blood. 

I awoke in a cold sweat to the noise from above. 

It was louder now, unmistakable. Not static exactly, but something uneven and distorted, like voices filtering through a bad connection. 

I sat up in bed, heart thudding in my chest. Claire stirred beside me, groaning softly.

‚ÄúJason?‚Äù she mumbled.

‚ÄúDo you hear that?‚Äù I asked, my voice low.

She didn‚Äôt answer right away, but her face tensed as she strained to listen. The sound wasn‚Äôt just faint anymore‚Äîit was distinct, tangible. I could finally make out the noise- it was voices. Rushed, muted speech, garbled by a grumbling static, the words muddy and indiscernible.

‚ÄúIs that a radio?‚Äù she asked, sitting up.

‚ÄúI think so,‚Äù I said, already climbing out of bed.

We followed the sound into the hallway, our footsteps loud on the creaky floor. The noise grew stronger as we neared the end of the hall, where a pull-down attic door sat flush with the ceiling.

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù Claire muttered, staring at it.

I reached up, tugging the ladder rope down with a loud groan of wood and metal- it didn‚Äôt budge. Claire fished her phone out of her pajama pocket, and shone her flashlight up towards the attic door. There was a small four-digit padlock holding the door shut. The owners clearly didn‚Äôt want any guests entering the attic.

The noise was much clearer now, a steady static interspersed with faint bursts of garbled speech.

‚ÄúYou think the owners left a radio on up there?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù she said, though her tone was uncertain. ‚ÄúWe should call them.‚Äù

I nodded, pulling out my phone. The number that was left on the AirBnB listing went straight to voicemail. I left a message, trying to sound calm but insistent. 

‚ÄúGuess we‚Äôll just have to deal with it for now,‚Äù I said, uneasy at the thought of leaving it playing all through the night. 

Claire‚Äôs expression hardened. ‚ÄúDeal with it? How are we supposed to sleep with that going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, okay?‚Äù I snapped, my annoyance bubbling over and giving way to anger. ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do, break in?‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt start.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not starting anything,‚Äù I shot back.

She stormed off without another word, the bedroom door slamming behind her.

I stood alone in the hallway, staring up at the attic door. The static buzzed in my ears, louder now, almost rhythmic.

It felt like it was waiting for something.

-

The next morning, I found Claire in the kitchen again, standing by the counter with her arms crossed and a mug of untouched coffee sitting beside her. She wasn‚Äôt scrolling through her phone this time‚Äîjust staring out the window as the storm‚Äôs remnants swirled in slow, aimless patterns.

The radio hadn‚Äôt stopped. It had finally grown quieter in the early hours of the morning, but now it was back, faint but persistent, distorted speech pouring through the ceiling, filling the air with tension.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt sleep, did you?‚Äù I asked, trying to keep my voice neutral.

She turned her head slightly, just enough to glance at me from the corner of her eye. ‚ÄúHard to sleep when there‚Äôs a radio running all night.‚Äù

I sighed and leaned against the doorway. ‚ÄúI already tried calling the owner again when I woke up. What do you want me to do? Smash the lock and risk paying for damages?‚Äù

Her shoulders tensed, and I could feel the argument building before she even opened her mouth. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just the noise, Jason,‚Äù she said, turning to face me fully now. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the voices.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre faint,‚Äù I replied, brushing her concern aside. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably just some talk show or something‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know that,‚Äù she snapped, her voice rising. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs creepy. It‚Äôs weird. And you‚Äôre acting like it‚Äôs normal!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs normal,‚Äù I said, my patience wearing thin. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not going to lose my mind over a busted radio in an old house, either.‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed, and she stepped closer, her voice low and sharp. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always like this. You act like I‚Äôm crazy for being upset, like everything‚Äôs my fault because I can‚Äôt just ‚Äòrelax‚Äô like you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not fair, Claire,‚Äù I said, my jaw tightening. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting like I put the damn radio there just to piss you off.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe you didn‚Äôt, but you sure as hell aren‚Äôt doing anything about it.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to fire back when something stopped me.

A voice crackled through the static, clearer and louder than anything we‚Äôd heard so far.

‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm the one making this harder than it has to be? You‚Äôre impossible to talk to, Claire.‚Äù

I froze.

Claire‚Äôs eyes widened as she stared at me, her face pale. ‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù

I hesitated, trying to process what I‚Äôd just heard. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs nothing. Probably just‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù she said, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me that wasn‚Äôt you.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me,‚Äù I insisted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúJason, that was exactly what you said to me yesterday‚Äù

The static broke again, like a scratched record, and the voice resumed, now faint but unmistakable: ‚ÄúStop putting this all on me, Claire. You‚Äôre just imagining things, I didn‚Äôt go anywhere tonight.‚Äù

I took a step back, my stomach twisting. It wasn‚Äôt just the words‚Äîit was the cadence, the exact rhythm of my voice.

Claire‚Äôs hands trembled as she pressed them to her forehead. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you, you‚Äôre doing this,‚Äù she said, her voice sharp and brittle. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying to mess with me, with my emotions. Do you think it‚Äôs funny‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? No!‚Äù I said, my own voice rising now. ‚ÄúClaire, how could I even‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been trying to fix this trip from the beginning, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù she spat. She began to hyperventilate. ‚ÄúLike we could just patch everything up if- if somehow you controlled the situation!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not controlling anything!‚Äù

The static surged, loud enough to make my ears ring, and through it came another burst of words, this time in Claire‚Äôs voice: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so damn selfish, Jason. You only care about fixing things on your terms.‚Äù

Her face crumpled as the words registered, and she looked at me like she‚Äôd been slapped.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs from‚Ä¶ last summer,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúWhen we fought about my job offer. That‚Äôs me.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to deny it, to tell her she was wrong, but then I heard it again‚Äîher voice, warped but unmistakable, repeating the exact words I‚Äôd heard her yell during that fight.

‚ÄúYou want to fix everything, Jason? Why don‚Äôt you fix yourself first.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt just random.

It was us.

I backed up against the counter, my pulse pounding in my ears. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?‚Äù

Claire shook her head, her face pale and her hands still trembling. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want to hear it anymore.‚Äù

She turned and stormed out of the kitchen, slamming the bedroom door behind her.

I stood there, staring at the ceiling where the faint sound of static hummed steadily through the boards. A chill ran down my spine as the sound shifted, and for a moment, I thought I could hear the creak of footsteps from above.

It was faint, almost imperceptible, but it was enough to keep me rooted in place, staring up at the locked attic door, as Claire‚Äôs garbled voice echoed through the attic again.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I ever married you.‚Äù

-

Time blurred into itself, the storm outside returning to bury the cabin in deeper drifts of snow and the sound upstairs filling our world with a ceaseless, mocking static. At times, it would go quiet, just long enough for Claire and me to let our guards down, consider talking about something‚Äîanything‚Äîbeyond our own misery. But right when I thought we might have a chance at conversation, the radio would crackle back to life, louder and more intrusive than before.

It was a few days in when I realized that it wasn‚Äôt just replaying our worst arguments anymore- it was anything we‚Äôd spoken to or about each other. I heard my own voice from months ago telling a friend how ‚ÄúClaire doesn‚Äôt see me,‚Äù how ‚Äúshe makes everything a battle.‚Äù 

A while later it shifted to Claire‚Äôs voice, raw and sobbing, confiding in her sister that she didn‚Äôt know how much longer she could endure me. I recognized every word, every breath, because I remembered her phone call that night‚Äîshe‚Äôd locked herself in the bathroom, and I‚Äôd pressed my ear against the door. I had never regretting being nosy as much as that night. Here it was, echoing through the attic, laid bare.

Every time the voice became clearer, I‚Äôd see Claire‚Äôs face tighten, a tortured mix of guilt and fury. We couldn‚Äôt escape each other‚Äôs taunts, or the house‚Äôs apparent need to throw them at us like daggers.

We hardly said a word to each other, circling each other in the small cabin, surviving on canned soup and stale crackers. I tried calling the owner again and again, leaving voicemails that grew more frantic with each attempt. My calls went unreturned, my hope dwindling with each missed connection.  

Claire‚Äôs phone signal was the next to go. She‚Äôd tried to scroll through social media, text her friends, anything to distract herself, but no matter where she stood or where she tried, her phone could barely muster one bar. She sank onto the couch, eyes full of tears that she refused to let fall in front of me.

‚ÄúWe have to leave,‚Äù she whispered on our fifth day in the cabin, her voice trembling as she stared at the swirling white chaos through the window. ‚ÄúJason, I can‚Äôt stay here anymore.‚Äù

We had discussed leaving the day before, but the weather had barely permitted us to open the front door. It hadn‚Äôt let up much since then, but the desperation in her voice shook me. Without another word, we bundled up‚Äîthick coats, gloves, scarves. I helped tie her boots. There was something almost tender in the gesture, and for a moment I wondered if we could reconcile, to pull ourselves out of this nightmare by sheer force of will.

But stepping outside was like entering a frozen void. The wind whipped icy needles of snow at our faces, and the driveway was half-buried in drifts. I dug at the car door, yanking the icy handle open only to find the interior of the car felt as cold and lifeless as the air around us. The engine refused to turn over, coughing twice before going silent.

I glanced at Claire. Her eyes darted to the steep, unpaved road that snaked down the mountain. Even if the car started, we‚Äôd be risking our lives trying to maneuver those icy curves. We looked at each other, and I knew she felt as defeated as I did. 

We trudged back to the cabin, fighting each step through the wind. My fingers had gone numb in spite of my gloves. Claire was shivering violently, a silent terror in her eyes. When I finally managed to force the swollen cabin door open, that now-familiar static rushed out to greet us. 

And then I heard it. Claire‚Äôs voice upstairs, as usual, speaking words I wished I‚Äôd never have to hear. She sounded almost gentle, but her words were damning.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave him soon,‚Äù she said, her tone calm and intimate. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt have a clue.‚Äù

My heart lurched.  Real or not, it felt like a blade twisting in my gut. I glanced at her. Her eyes were wide, tears threatening to spill, the betrayal fresh even though those words were her own. She looked at me, shook her head, and without speaking, retreated to the bedroom, shutting the door quietly behind her.

I stood there, snow melting on my boots, face stinging from the cold, and listened to the static pick up again. The cabin creaked in the wind, sounding almost like a soft, mocking laugh. I could only stare at the dying embers in the fireplace, wondering if anything in our lives would survive this place.

-

As the relentless static from the attic wore on, it seemed to scrape away at the edges of my sanity. The voices unearthed every bitter line, every whispered complaint we thought safely hidden. The cabin felt like a cage, trapping us with an auditory barrage that knew no bounds. Each new revelation, whether a conversation once held secret or a venomous whisper shared in confidence, added weight to an already unbearable tension.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just too much, Jason. Always fixing, never listening.‚Äù

Exhausted and desperate, I found myself fixated on the attic. The padlock‚Äîan old, rusted relic‚Äîmocked me from the ceiling hatch, a barrier to whatever twisted machine perpetuated our torment. I needed to get it open, needed to find out what was happening, but every traditional method had failed. No amount of pleading with the unresponsive owner or searching for a misplaced key had yielded any results. It was just Claire and me, growing more estranged with each passing hour.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to stay this distant forever, Claire, you might as well just leave.‚Äù

Determined, I approached the hatch again, armed with nothing but a sense of determination. I grabbed a chair from the kitchen, positioning it under the attic‚Äôs pull-down string. The padlock dangled just out of reach, an enigmatic sentinel guarding our tormentor. Did I even want to find out what was up there? The need to stop the voices overpowered any hesitation.

I fetched a small toolbox from under the kitchen sink‚Äîthe one that barely saw use‚Äîand rummaged through it for anything that might help. I came up with a couple of old screwdrivers and a tarnished set of Allen keys. Not ideal, but it was all I had.

‚ÄúWhy bother, Jason? It‚Äôs over, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

I ignored the jibes, focusing on the padlock. I tried each tool systematically, twisting and prodding in a futile attempt to force the mechanism. I eventually gave up on trying to break open the lock, and in my desperation, resorted to trying any and every combination I could think of. My hands, raw from the metal and the cold that seeped into the cabin, worked mechanically. Time lost meaning as I moved from one combination to the next, fueled by a mix of fury and a desperate need for silence.

Hours must have passed, the light outside dimming to the early twilight that predicted another long night. The numbers blurred before my eyes, each click a mockery as our voices cried from above.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to leave, you know. Can‚Äôt you tell?‚Äù  My brother‚Äôs voice seemed to boom down at me from above. I winced as I anticipated my next words.
‚ÄúLet her. I don‚Äôt need this hassle any longer.‚Äù

The frustration and shame built within me like a physical force, a crescendo that demanded release. As I furiously put in every four digit combination I could think of, the realization hit me like a brick. I stopped on a new combination; 1-2-3-1. Today‚Äôs date, but more importantly, our wedding anniversary. A detail that had slipped from my conscious mind but lay buried, a remnant of happier times.

With all of the remaining effort my frigid, tired hand could muster, I pulled. The lock clicked open.

Relief washed over me, quickly chased by apprehension. What would I find up there? Claire had arisen from the couch and watched, her face a mask of mingled fear and curiosity. Her silence was a gulf between us, but this act‚Äîopening the attic‚Äîfelt like the first truly shared moment in days.

I pulled the string, and the ladder creaked down, dust dancing in the air disturbed by its descent. We both flinched at the sharp, echoing sound of the radio, clear as day, coming from above. 

I hesitated, my hand on the ladder. The air felt charged, thick with the anticipation of what was yet to come. The static above us quieted for a moment, as if the attic itself held its breath.

‚ÄúWhat are you afraid of, Jason? You‚Äôre a coward! Just run away from it all, isn‚Äôt that what you always do?‚Äù

With a deep breath, I started to climb. The ladder groaned under my weight, each step a creak of old wood. Claire stayed below, her face upturned, watching me ascend into the darkness above.

As I approached the top, the chill of the attic wrapped around me, a cold whisper against my skin. I paused, flashlight in hand, ready to sweep away the shadows and uncover the source of our torment. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to turn it on, to see what was up here. At least not alone. Instead, I turned it down towards my wife, and extended my hand down to help her up.

As Claire and I reached the final step of the attic ladder, a chilling silence enveloped us, broken only by the echo of our hesitant footsteps on the floor. It didn‚Äôt feel like the rest of the cabin- it felt cheap, and warm. Linoleum?

The beam from my flashlight cut through the darkness, revealing a sight that made my heart skip a beat. The sight before us wasn‚Äôt just impossible, it was chilling. We were back home, in our crappy little apartment. Or, at least, a perfect replica of it. 

Every detail was meticulously reproduced: the arrangement of books on the shelves, the crease on the sofa cushion, even the small, almost imperceptible stain on the carpet near the TV stand. It was our home, duplicated with an unsettling precision, as if someone had taken a snapshot of our lives and recreated it here in the dusty confines of the attic. 

The air was unnervingly still, thick with a tension that seemed almost palpable. It felt as if the room was holding its breath, waiting for us to shatter the quiet. The musty smell that I‚Äôd noticed when first entering the cabin was amplified to the extreme, and was permeated with an iron, metallic scent that sent my stomach churning. 

My eyes swept the room, searching for the source of the voices that had tormented us. We didn‚Äôt own any radio, nor a record player or any speakers for that matter. Instead, my gaze landed on something far more familiar‚Äîmy laptop, open on the coffee table, its screen aglow.

I ran over to the battered device, tripping over its power cord as I went. The laptop sat neatly on the table, as the mouse plugged into it moved of its own accord, clicking the screen every few seconds. My eyes darted to the smudged screen, and discovered that it was opened to our security app. I‚Äôd installed cheap cameras around the apartment soon after we moved in. I‚Äôd told Claire that they were for our own safety, but in truth, they were for me- to revisit our arguments, to replay every fight we had, searching for vindication in the details.

The computer was clicking from clip to clip, playing a highlight reel of every terrible thing we‚Äôd ever said to or about each other. 

Claire joined me, her steps slow, almost reluctant. Her eyes widened in horror as she watched the screen. I looked back down at the laptop, only to realize that it had changed once again. I immediately recognized the fight- it was the most recent one before we‚Äôd left home.

‚ÄúClaire, would you listen to me? It‚Äôs two weeks, you‚Äôll live. It‚Äôll be nice and quiet.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho says I even want nice and quiet? I want to get back to real life, Jason. I haven‚Äôt worked in months, and you planning these ‚Äòsurprise trips‚Äô to try to patch things isn‚Äôt helping me find a job‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what? I cancel the booking? I already paid the deposit Claire, we can‚Äôt get that money back. Or did you forget I‚Äôm also working a dead-end job?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you want to book that stupid anniversary trip, go right ahead. You just bulldoze ahead like what you want is the only thing that matters.‚Äù

I watched myself furrow my brow and then put my head in my hand.

‚ÄúClaire, I‚Äôm trying here. I really am. But I can never get through to you, can I? First it was you passing on the job offer when we needed that money, then it was that thing with your ex-‚Äú

‚ÄúI TOLD you, nothing happened Jason. He just‚Ä¶ he just stopped by for coffee, is all.‚Äù

‚ÄúClaire, I‚Äôm not stupid! You turned off the cameras but the audio was still recording, you idiot.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare call me an idiot, after all I‚Äôve done for you.‚Äù

I watched as Claire had stormed towards me, and our fight was about to escalate. She pounced at me, but I threw her off of me towards the kitchen. I watched her crack her head on the edge of the table and fall through it.

I walked up to the table slowly. I observed her breathing grow shallow, as she lay spasming on the floor. I watched her breathing stop as blood slowly pooled around her. I watched myself stand up calmly, then walk into our bedroom. A minute later, I left, quietly wheeling our luggage towards the front door and leaving as my wife lay motionless.

Then, as if sensing its audience had seen enough, the laptop‚Äôs battery icon flashed once‚Äîcritical‚Äîand the screen went black. The sudden death of the device plunged me back into silence and darkness, a quiet so deep it was almost suffocating. The absence of the voices, which had been such a constant and invasive presence, now left a shallow emptiness that was somehow worse than the noise.

I sat for a moment, unable to process what I‚Äôd just seen. I turned my flashlight up towards Claire, only to see that I was now alone in the room, the dull smell of iron growing ever stronger from the kitchen. 

I shakily turned my flashlight again, this time towards the kitchen table, shrouded in a cloak of darkness that I hadn‚Äôt dared breach since I ascended the attic ladder.

There, lying crumpled in a heap of splintered wood, lay my wife. Dried blood had pooled around her head, and I winced at noticing that her neck was bent at an unnatural angle. She had begun to bloat and stiffen, and the closer I stepped, the more the iron scent of blood was replaced with a musky, rotted smell. 

She was almost entirely a corpse, save for her eyes. Fresh and watery, they were locked onto me, silently accusing me.

‚Äú‚Ä¶.Claire?‚Äù I whispered, praying with every fiber that somehow, she was still in there. 

But she didn‚Äôt respond, didn‚Äôt move. She lay frozen, staring intently, eyes following me as I nervously swayed. The air around us grew colder, denser, as if the room itself was closing in, feeding off the rising panic.

Then, almost imperceptibly, Claire began to whisper. The words were soft, disjointed murmurs at first, guttural sounds forcing their way out of a broken, bloated throat. As I drew closer, the whispers grew clearer, sharper. They were not the comforting words I yearned for but a continuation of the cascade of cruel, cutting phrases I‚Äôd grown accustomed to.

‚ÄúYou never really cared, did you, Jason? It was always about you, your needs.‚Äù Her voice was a ghost, devoid even of its usual disdain, hollow and haunting.

I stood, frozen, as her whispers intensified, layering upon each other in a relentless, cold assault. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so selfish. You think you‚Äôre the victim, always playing the martyr.‚Äù 

Each word sliced through the already frigid air. The whispers swelled into a torrent of accusations.

‚ÄúYou suffocate me, Jason. I can‚Äôt breathe with you, can‚Äôt grow. You‚Äôre a dead weight, dragging me down into your misery.‚Äù

I stumbled backward, hands clamped over my ears, but it was futile.

‚ÄúS- stop it Claire. Please get up, this isn‚Äôt okay. Please get up!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should have known I was too good for you. I wasted the best years of my life on a fantasy that you‚Äôd change.‚Äù

Her face, so familiar and yet so warped, contorted as her dead lips struggled to keep up with the verbal onslaught. The storm outside seemed to echo her fury, the wind howling against the walls as if in sympathy with her rage.

Overwhelmed and unable to bear it, I dropped to my knees, the cold of the floor seeping into my bones. Claire‚Äôs figure, crumpled across from mine, began to crunch as her frame contorted itself so she could continue to lock eyes with me. Her expression was blank, but her eyes piecing as she continued her litany of grievances. 

I crawled, sobbing, searching in the dark for the attic door that led me here, but it had long vanished. The floor was solid.

As the roar of the frozen world outside began to muffle, snow piling against our artificial windows, her voice was the only sound, a relentless echo in the ghostly replica of our apartment. Her words didn‚Äôt stop for hours, and by the time she began to quiet, she had managed to stand up and loom over me, cold and pale, whispering accusations and curses at me in the dark.

It has been weeks since the door to the outside vanished, leaving me trapped in my own home with the whispering thing that was once my wife. Claire, or the thing that used to be her, grows more gaunt by the day, her features sharpening, her eyes sinking deeper into her skull. She‚Äôs starting to smell, but she keeps whispering. She isn‚Äôt going to harm me‚Äînot physically. She can‚Äôt. Her body, crumbling and decaying, only has the energy to torment me with its gaze and with its words.

I‚Äôve tried the front door, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any more than decoration in this mockery of my home. It doesn‚Äôt lead outside, it doesn‚Äôt even open. It‚Äôs just part of the wall. The storm outside has not abated; I can hear it sometimes, through the thick snow that covers my windows. If the snow ever subsides, the windows may be my only chance at escape.

I‚Äôm typing this now as both a record and a plea. If you‚Äôre reading this, if this somehow finds its way to someone, anyone, do you know when the blizzard near Denver will let up? Is there any forecast about when the snow will start to melt? It‚Äôs cold in here, and I don‚Äôt think I can listen to her for much longer.

1j3fel9,https://www.reddit.com/r/fanStands/comments/1j3fel9/coffee_scotch_mermaid/,„ÄåCOFFEE SCOTCH MERMAID„Äç,"Localization: Coffee Shop Mermaid

Namesake: [m.c.A„ÉªT song of the same name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EssKXXovMlg)

Appearance: Coffee Scotch Mermaid is a suit stand with a scale-like, glittery hide, with large fins around its body. Its helmet is stylized after a sea monster, and it has clawed gloves and boots.

Ability: Along with bestowing its wearer with enhanced physical and combat abilities, CSM has an ability which activates whenever its wearer is inside of an enclosed space with multiple sections. This includes cars with trunks, dresser shelves, and luggage with multiple compartments, but is most often used with buildings and houses.

CSM's wearer can walk into the walls of an enclosed space and reappear through another wall in that same space, or in another ""section"" of it, like another room in the same building, instantaneously. Additionally, multiple instances of CSM and its wearer may exist within the enclosed space, by entering one wall and exiting through multiple different walls at once, in different ""rooms"". The wearer can bring objects and people through walls with them, but doing so doesn't create a new copy of them.

CSM's wearer cannot exit the enclosed space while their ability is active, i.e. while one or more copies of themselves are wearing the stand. No copy of the user wearing the stand ends the effect, dissolving every copy. Each instance of the user is a separate entity with the same goals, aspirations, and personality. While each copy acts in accordance with the original's interests, they have no direct control over what any copy of themselves does. Objects the original had on their person while activating the ability, such as clothes, electronics, and other personal effects, are also copied and disappear when the effect ends. Each copy doesn't share damage.

This ability can't be used to ""exit"" the larger enclosed space. For example, if the user is locked in the trunk of a car, they can move through the trunk's walls to get inside the vehicle, but not directly outside of it. Whenever two or more instances of CSM's wearer occupies the same section/room/compartment, they automatically rejoin into one entity, giving the singular entity all of its copy's memories.

1j3fcli,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1j3fcli/i_grew_up_witnessing_violence_traumatic_events/,"I grew up witnessing violence, traumatic events, used heroin from 13-15 years old, didn't get sober until last year. Substance use Counselor now and living a somewhat normal life. AMA","I am the youngest of 3 older brothers, parents still married (somehow). Our family has strong bonds but problems out the ass. One of my first memories was around 4-5 years old was my Dad headbutting my brother and splitting his nose open, blood everywhere, yelling/crying. 

I feel like this set the pace for things in my life as I grew up very anxious as yelling, fighting, screaming was a very common thing in my household. I had a very close (probably unhealthy) bond with my oldest brother (we are 10 years apart) throughout my life. All of my brothers and I are close but my oldest we had a different bond. He went to prison when i was around 7-8 years old if i recall correctly? This destroyed me at a young age. I remember crying every birthday, missing my brother, talking to him on the phone and hearing the ""This call is from an inmate at (insert name of prison)"" 

I remember always pretending to be sick so I didn't have to go school and made my younger anxious self even worse. Despite this, there was good in my life, played sports, had friends, but very much struggled in my mind. My brother also had a girlfriend who I became extremely attached to and she lived with us when we moved to Arizona shortly after my brother going to prison. I looked at her as my sister and absolutely idolized her. 

I remember having a strange experience with her, we were watching some Disney movie and ended up sleeping in the same bed and slept in a spooning position. I think this was my first introduction to romantic feelings and even at that age it felt odd. My mom was absolutely livid that morning, and I got yelled at. Could have only been 10-11 years old and feeling very confused as why I was getting reamed for this. The thing that sucked is that I longed for that feeling again and wasn't able to.

There were some other foggy memories of weird romantic/inappropriate at a younger age that are muddled and I honestly can't tell if they were real or not, a memory of being in the shower with a family member and seeing their genitals and them touching me, a cousin kissing/touching me but I honestly can't tell if those things were real, maybe my brain blocking out trauma I still really don't know to this day. 

Living in Arizona, we would travel back to Ohio to visit family, I was in 7th grade visiting one summer and decided to smoke Marijuana with some childhood friends. The experience wasn't unique, we laughed, ate a bunch of food and passed out. This started my journey with substance use. Coming back that Summer i was a very enthralled with Weed and my closest friend was already smoking and it made that easier to do. 

We would by spice (K2) a lot because we could get more of it than Marijuana at the time. The insane, terrifying experiences I had while under the influence of that drug at the age of 12-13 years old, absolutely gave me brain damage. I remember smoking this before walking to the bus stop with my friend and absolutely started hallucinating. I heard a women singing a song, I'll explain this to the best of my ability lol. It went something like  ""Dow dow doo heechy hich, WOO WOO."" this woman just kept singing and repeating this as I am losing it on the bus ride to school. 

My friend and I continued to experiment with substances and at the ripe age of 13 we got our hands on some psilocybin mushrooms, around this age I was heavily influenced by males in my life and didn't really have a direction of my own and my friend was into Terrance Mckenna, thus, I followed suit. He gave me a little over 2 grams of these and it was a sunny Arizona day

I think using Psychedelic drugs at this age was one of the worst decisions I've made in my life as i have had long lasting effects from this experience (even now as an adult.) We ate them, waited about 40 minutes and began walking down the wash (Wash is a trail in AZ.) I remember seeing this big purple outline of an angel in the sky, having the heavy legs, almost a drunk kind of feeling. As we kept walking, my 13 year old mind started opening up to thoughts that overencumbered me, what is life? Why am i a person, does anything have any meaning? This instantly sent me into panic and I would go from enjoying the trip to being in terrifying thought loops. 

I began to come down and went home, I felt the trip was over. All of my 3 older brother, 2 of their girlfriends, and my parents were home. I was a little anxious coming home but the trip was over no worries right? As soon as I walked in my front door it was like the trip restarted from ingestion. Everything looked gargantuan and panic set in. I was sitting next to my mom on the couch and she had this Baraka (guy from Mortal Kombat) smile stretched across her face. 

I felt the need to keep explaining this, but I don't want to glorify substance use, even though my description of this experience is not my intention. Ultimately the use of this substance at a young age has given me long term depersonilization as an adult and this is a regret I live with.

This is the part of the story now relating to the title. As i mentioned earlier my brother and I had a very close relationship and when we got out of prison in Ohio, he moved to Arizona to live with us. My brother and his girlfriend ended up getting an apartment together, I would proceed to spend many weekends and summers with them. At this time, I was an avid Marijuana smoker (still around 13-14 years old) and figured I would ask my brother to smoke with me. I remember at first he was pissed and questioned why i did this, but eventually he let go and we smoked together. This opened the door for a different type of relationship to begin with us as it became more adult. 

My brother was in the shower one day and I heard a loud thud and went to check on him. When I opened the bathroom door he was sitting on the toilet with a piece of foil and straw in his hand and I asked what he was doing. He told me it was a candle and that he was tired from work. I'm a kid and idolized my brother so I took his word for it. Eventually curiosity got to me and I looked more into this and realized he was smoking whatever this stuff was.

It was a nice warm Arizona Summer evening, around sunset, and I asked my brother what that stuff on the foil was. I told him I knew it wasn't a candle and he told me it was Hash. With enough prying and asking for him to let me try it, he gave in. I remember this experience very vividly to this day, blue straw, crinkling of the foil, and the noise it made as it burned along the tray. The taste was like if you burn something on a charcoal grill, burnt coffee taste is the best way I can explain it. I had never felt so at peace, a drowsy calm that washed over me as we drove around in my brothers little white truck. 

This ensued for the next 2 years and I witnessed the degradation of human life. My brother began selling heroin (the drug was not hash that we smoked on the foil) and when you are essentially living with a drug dealer and hanging out with heroin addicts all day, your juvenile age doesn't come into play. Watching people half alive, covered in scabs, crying at the door for a front, watching people get bludgeoned over owing money. I could go on and on about the stories and events that took place in that apartment but maybe that's a different for a separate story on its own.

My brother and his girlfriend ended up losing the apartment, their son (my nephew who is named after me) and were homeless out in AZ. During this time my father lost his job at a power plant and moved back to Ohio to work construction. He left my mom and I in Arizona while our world crumbled apart. I try not to hold resentment towards him but there is always a small bit of me that does. I watched my Mom lose her mind over that summer as she had to take custody of my nephew and dealing with my brother. All this time, nobody other than my brother and his girlfriend knew what I was doing with them.

We move back to Ohio and my world flips on its head, I was a Sophmore in high school and hated school and being back in Ohio. I think due to the traumatic events in my life up to this point i was in full fledged psychosis (probably also not using heroin anymore) I was convinced that I had died, nothing was real, life didn't make sense. I quit using all drugs but found that alcohol was the cure to my problems and alcohol became a constant in my life. 

My brothers girlfriend ended up passing away, rocked my world, started abusing anything I could get my hands on, cough medicine, weed, alcohol, bendaryl (Please don't ever abuse this substance.) I continued on this path after high school, being in shitty relationships, negative friends, wasting time. I went to AA for a long time and I could never maintain more than like 3 months without. I worked in corrections, treatment, I'd be the best best employee at time and then the worst once i picked back up. 

My lovely, beautiful girlfriend (still with her, plan on getting married soon.) We have been together 5 years and she has seen the worst of me, but pushed me to get it together and my last drink/use January 3rd 2024, I was at her apartment, sneaking my alcohol and she caught me. She told me to leave and that she was calling my family to tell them i had relapsed. I acted like a damn fool, threatening, yelling, but she stood firm. That next morning I quit my job, I was working as a SUD counselor at an outreach center, a lot of guilt about this as i was in active use/drinking the whole time working there. I went to treatment and made a promise to myself I was done living like this, got on some mental health medications and really started working on myself.

I work at a PHP treatment center now and I really thrive in my job and push myself to try and be better everyday. One of my brothers (not mentioned in this story yet) died from an overdose this year in January and my family and I watched him pass. I'm still processing this but I am using my coping skills and tools to move forward in a healthy manner.

\[Scene 1\]



\[car door opening\]



\[car door closing\]



\[stepping towards the door\]



Thank you, for dropping me off.



\[Talking while unlocking door with key\]



Y-you sure you don‚Äôt, umm, want to come inside?



Well, you‚Äôve dropped me off this late at night so, you know, I thought maybe, you know.



I mean, I could offer you a cup of coffee at least. You seem very tired already. I wouldn‚Äôt want you to feel sleepy while driving. It just wouldn‚Äôt feel safe, you know?



\[Smiles\] Okay, great! Let‚Äôs go.



\[Door opening\]



Come in! You can leave your shoes over there.



\[door closing\]



So\~, you want your coffee \*with\* sugar or without?



Huh, wouldn‚Äôt it feel too bitter without sugar?



Hmm, I guess you‚Äôre right. The bitterness \*would\* help you feel less sleepy.



\[puts coffee mug on table\] Here, your hot cup of coffee, made by yours truly \[smiles\]



\[listener drinks coffee\]



So, how is it?



\[chuckles\] Yeah, I put some sugar in there for you. I just couldn‚Äôt help it, okay! How can give such a sweet guy like you something so bitter?



\[Chuckles\] Mhm, you \*are\* very sweet. Especially after what you did today. Treating me so well in the party, not letting your eyes off of me for a second. Even insisting on driving me home because it‚Äôs so late. I was really feeling like a princess today because of you.



Mhm\~



\[sigh\] So‚Ä¶ Do you, \*really\* need to go back?



I-I mean,¬† it‚Äôs already so late, and, you know. If you go home right now, by the time you‚Äôre there, you‚Äôre gonna be even more tired. And¬† like, you \*could\* drive all the way there, or you could just stay here with me.



\[talking in a panicked voice\]



I-I could even make you breakfast in the morning! And then you can just take your time, and leave whenever you feel like. Or, you know, you could take a shower maybe, or you know you could even stay over for lunch or, or-



R-really!?



\[excited\] Yay! I-I mean, I'm glad, that you want to stay over.



\[deep breath\] Okay!, okay. First of all, \*You\* are gonna need a bath, and a fresh change of clothes. I‚Äôll be right back. \[smiling to herself\]

  


\[scene 2\]



\[walking sounds\]



Oh, you finished your coffee. Here, your clothes. I left the water running just in case you wanted to take a bath.



A-are these my clothes? \[chuckle\] w-what, of course not! I bought them just for you! Here, let me show you.



See?



\[chuckles\] Yeah,¬† these are a little- well, a \*lot\* bigger than what you usually wear but, I didn‚Äôt really know your measurements¬† so I just played it safe and bought these instead.¬†



Well, I couldn‚Äôt just ask your measurements all of a sudden. Plus, you would start asking questions about \*why\* I‚Äôm asking for it, and then- it‚Äôs just a bit embarrassing okay.



It is! Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs weird¬† that I secretly bought these incase you ever stay over? It kinda makes it seem like I was hoping for it to happen- which I \*was\*, but- \[sigh\] I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs just a bit awkward for me.



\[smiles\] You like it?



Why is it pink? Well, I \*kinda\* wanted both of us to wear matching outfits‚Ä¶.



\[Embarrassed chuckles\] Stop looking at me like that, it‚Äôs just, something I find cute okay. Now go take a bath. I‚Äôll wait for you in my room.



\[scene 3\]



\[door opening\]



\[Smiles\]¬† Oh\~, someone is looking cute\~.



\[laughs\] You are! Look at you! I knew I made the right call buying these. These baggy clothes make you look so adorable.



Oh, give me that. I‚Äôll take care of the wet towel for you.



Oh, wait, your hair is still so wet, you want me to get the hair dryer?



No? Okay, let me at least wipe it with a dry towel, you‚Äôll catch a cold with so much water in your hair.



\[Hair wiping sounds\]



\[chuckles\] you smell so nice, did you use my shampoo?



No no, I‚Äôm not mad. Infect, I‚Äôm glad that you're making yourself comfortable, plus, you smell amazing right now. \*But\* , I doubt that‚Äôs just the shampoo doing the work though. I guess you just naturally have a very pleasing cent.



Yeah\~, I‚Äôve noticed it quite often throughout our dates actually. But, this being the first time I‚Äôve been so close to you, it‚Äôs just that much¬† more enchanting.



\[Hair wiping sounds end\]



There, all nice and dry. \[smiles\]



You want something to eat? Or, you just want to go to bed?



\[Smiles\] Yeah, I thought so. Here, let me know which pillow you feel like is the best for you. As you can see, I clearly have¬† more than I should \[chuckles\].



Hmm? Well, of course we will sleep on the bed, how can I ask you to sleepover and let you sleep on the couch? Unless, you are not comfortable with us sharing the bed- in which case I can always-



Oh, you‚Äôre okay with sharing a bed. Okay then, I‚Äôll just get freshened up and join you in a bit. F-feel free to fall asleep in the meanwhile, don‚Äôt feel like you have to wait for me or anything.



Okay, I‚Äôll be right back!



\[scene 4\]



\[slowly opening the door\]



\[slowly closing the door\]



\[whispering\] Hey, you awake?



\[talking in normal voice\]



O-oh, you are \[chuckles\] I hope I didn‚Äôt wake you up or anything. I swear these doors make the loudest noise exactly when you want to be quiet.



Oh, you were waiting for me. Well, you didn‚Äôt need to, but, I do appreciate that \[smiles\].



So uh, let me get rid of these extra pillows over here.



\[bedsheet sounds\]



There we go. You feel comfortable by the way? Let me know if you want me to scoot over.



No no, I mean it. I just want to make sure you‚Äôre feeling as comfortable as you can. I know it can be a bit difficult to fall asleep in a bed you‚Äôre not used to. So just let me know if you need anything.



Y-yeah, good night.



\[some time passes\]



\[bedsheet sounds\]



\[talking in a lower voice from now on\]



Hmm, O-oh, I‚Äôm sorry, did I wake you up?

Oh,¬† you never fell asleep. Is it because I‚Äôm moving around too much? I‚Äôm sorry if that‚Äôs the case.



You're Just having a hard time falling asleep?



I-is it because of the coffee? I guess if I was gonna ask for you to stay over, I should‚Äôve just held off on the coffee shouldn't I.



Oh, it‚Äôs not that either.



\[chuckles\] yeah, I guess it might be the change of scenery, I guess it \*is\* your first time sleeping over‚Ä¶¬†



Well, to be honest, I \*kinda\* feel the same way \[chuckles\]



Well, No, I don't feel awkward, it's just..¬† different I guess. Just, having you here, so close to me. \[chuckles\] Kinda feels like a dream to be honest.



A good dream or a bad dream? Well, it‚Äôs certainly a \*very\* very good one. \[smiles\]



Mhm, I know I‚Äôve been trying to act all cool and stuff, as if it's just another night for me. Even though I've been nothing but a bumbling mess this whole time \[giggling\]. But no, it‚Äôs not \*just\* another night. It‚Äôs a lot more special than that. Because I have you right beside me. And even though my heart is pounding out of my chest right now, I know this is right. I know this is \*exactly\* where I want to be. Right beside you.



\[chuckles\] Yeah, my heart is beating \*so\* hard right now.



\[giggles\] Yours too?



Well, w-would you‚Ä¶¬† like to feel it? My heartbeat I mean.



Here, give me your hand.



\[placing hand on your chest\]



\[optional heartbeat¬† sound\]



Here, can you feel it? Yeah, I think having your heart over it made it beat even faster \[giggles\].



Huh? O-oh, yeah, I‚Äôd like to feel yours too.



\[places hand on his heart\]



Whoa, it's beating so fast¬† \[giggles\]. We really need to calm down¬† don't we? \[chuckles\].



You know, since we are feeling each other's heartbeat like this anyway, C-could we, maybe try to cuddle? I-I mean only if you‚Äôre okay with it of course.



W-we can!? O-okay, yeah! Let‚Äôs- let‚Äôs do it.



\[bedsheet sounds\]

So like, you want to spoon, or like want me to cuddle up on you?



Okay, yeah, we can try that. Here, I‚Äôll let you lay in the middle, I‚Äôll rest my head on your chest.



Are you comfortable this way?



Okay, that‚Äôs, that's good.



Yeah, I‚Äôm alright, I‚Äôm¬† comfortable this way, yeah.



\[deep breath\] This feels, nice. \[smiles\]



Mhm, it does.



Oh-oh, you're stroking my head.



N-no no! It feels really nice actually. \[chuckles\]



Yeah, it feels really good. I might actually fall asleep this way \[chuckles\].



Hmm? Did I dream about cuddling you like this? Well, not \*exactly\* like this, but, we will do those soon enough.



Yep, Now that we‚Äôve cuddled like this, we are gonna try a \*lot\* of different things together.



\[laughs\] Yeah, just give it some time, and I‚Äôll show you \*exactly\* the things I dream of.



No\~, it‚Äôs not a threat. It‚Äôs just a warning \[giggles\].



I am so glad, by the way. That you chose to stay. I know we‚Äôve been dating for a while now, but we‚Äôve never really been this‚Ä¶ intimate before. And now that we have, I am \*so\* glad that we have. Feeling my head on your chest. feeling it go up and down with each breath you take. Feeling your gentle breath brushing against my hair. Listening to your heartbeat, gently slowing down, but then raising with each movement I make. \[smiles\]. Feeling your sweet scent, and your soft hands, petting my head, ever so gently. It‚Äôs the best feeling I‚Äôve ever felt.



Mhm, it is.



\[yawns\] \[chuckles\] Yeah, I guess I am finally starting to feel sleepy.



\[smiles\] Yeah, let‚Äôs fall asleep, just like this.



Mhm. I want to know what it feels¬† like to wake up in your arms.



\[giggles\] Or I will just roll off the bed and wake up on the floor tomorrow.



\[giggles\] Oh\~, you won‚Äôt let me\~. Well, I guess we will find out tomorrow morning won't we?

\[Scene 1\]



\[car door opening\]



\[car door closing\]



\[stepping towards the door\]



Thank you, for dropping me off.



\[Talking while unlocking door with key\]



Y-you sure you don‚Äôt, umm, want to come inside?



Well, you‚Äôve dropped me off this late at night so, you know, I thought maybe, you know.



I mean, I could offer you a cup of coffee at least. You seem very tired already. I wouldn‚Äôt want you to feel sleepy while driving. It just wouldn‚Äôt feel safe, you know?



\[Smiles\] Okay, great! Let‚Äôs go.



\[Door opening\]



Come in! You can leave your shoes over there.



\[door closing\]



So\~, you want your coffee \*with\* sugar or without?



Huh, wouldn‚Äôt it feel too bitter without sugar?



Hmm, I guess you‚Äôre right. The bitterness \*would\* help you feel less sleepy.



\[puts coffee mug on table\] Here, your hot cup of coffee, made by yours truly \[smiles\]



\[listener drinks coffee\]



So, how is it?



\[chuckles\] Yeah, I put some sugar in there for you. I just couldn‚Äôt help it, okay! How can give such a sweet guy like you something so bitter?



\[Chuckles\] Mhm, you \*are\* very sweet. Especially after what you did today. Treating me so well in the party, not letting your eyes off of me for a second. Even insisting on driving me home because it‚Äôs so late. I was really feeling like a princess today because of you.



Mhm\~



\[sigh\] So‚Ä¶ Do you, \*really\* need to go back?



I-I mean,¬† it‚Äôs already so late, and, you know. If you go home right now, by the time you‚Äôre there, you‚Äôre gonna be even more tired. And¬† like, you \*could\* drive all the way there, or you could just stay here with me.



\[talking in a panicked voice\]



I-I could even make you breakfast in the morning! And then you can just take your time, and leave whenever you feel like. Or, you know, you could take a shower maybe, or you know you could even stay over for lunch or, or-



R-really!?



\[excited\] Yay! I-I mean, I'm glad, that you want to stay over.



\[deep breath\] Okay!, okay. First of all, \*You\* are gonna need a bath, and a fresh change of clothes. I‚Äôll be right back. \[smiling to herself\]



\[scene 2\]



\[walking sounds\]



Oh, you finished your coffee. Here, your clothes. I left the water running just in case you wanted to take a bath.



A-are these my clothes? \[chuckle\] w-what, of course not! I bought them just for you! Here, let me show you.



See?



\[chuckles\] Yeah,¬† these are a little- well, a \*lot\* bigger than what you usually wear but, I didn‚Äôt really know your measurements¬† so I just played it safe and bought these instead.¬†



Well, I couldn‚Äôt just ask your measurements all of a sudden. Plus, you would start asking questions about \*why\* I‚Äôm asking for it, and then- it‚Äôs just a bit embarrassing okay.



It is! Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs weird¬† that I secretly bought these incase you ever stay over? It kinda makes it seem like I was hoping for it to happen- which I \*was\*, but- \[sigh\] I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs just a bit awkward for me.



\[smiles\] You like it?



Why is it pink? Well, I \*kinda\* wanted both of us to wear matching outfits‚Ä¶.



\[Embarrassed chuckles\] Stop looking at me like that, it‚Äôs just, something I find cute okay. Now go take a bath. I‚Äôll wait for you in my room.



\[scene 3\]



\[door opening\]



\[Smiles\]¬† Oh\~, someone is looking cute\~.



\[laughs\] You are! Look at you! I knew I made the right call buying these. These baggy clothes make you look so adorable.



Oh, give me that. I‚Äôll take care of the wet towel for you.



Oh, wait, your hair is still so wet, you want me to get the hair dryer?



No? Okay, let me at least wipe it with a dry towel, you‚Äôll catch a cold with so much water in your hair.



\[Hair wiping sounds\]



\[chuckles\] you smell so nice, did you use my shampoo?



No no, I‚Äôm not mad. Infect, I‚Äôm glad that you're making yourself comfortable, plus, you smell amazing right now. \*But\* , I doubt that‚Äôs just the shampoo doing the work though. I guess you just naturally have a very pleasing cent.



Yeah\~, I‚Äôve noticed it quite often throughout our dates actually. But, this being the first time I‚Äôve been so close to you, it‚Äôs just that much¬† more enchanting.



\[Hair wiping sounds end\]



There, all nice and dry. \[smiles\]



You want something to eat? Or, you just want to go to bed?



\[Smiles\] Yeah, I thought so. Here, let me know which pillow you feel like is the best for you. As you can see, I clearly have¬† more than I should \[chuckles\].



Hmm? Well, of course we will sleep on the bed, how can I ask you to sleepover and let you sleep on the couch? Unless, you are not comfortable with us sharing the bed- in which case I can always-



Oh, you‚Äôre okay with sharing a bed. Okay then, I‚Äôll just get freshened up and join you in a bit. F-feel free to fall asleep in the meanwhile, don‚Äôt feel like you have to wait for me or anything.



Okay, I‚Äôll be right back!



\[scene 4\]



\[slowly opening the door\]



\[slowly closing the door\]



\[whispering\] Hey, you awake?



\[talking in normal voice\]



O-oh, you are \[chuckles\] I hope I didn‚Äôt wake you up or anything. I swear these doors make the loudest noise exactly when you want to be quiet.



Oh, you were waiting for me. Well, you didn‚Äôt need to, but, I do appreciate that \[smiles\].



So uh, let me get rid of these extra pillows over here.



\[bedsheet sounds\]



There we go. You feel comfortable by the way? Let me know if you want me to scoot over.



No no, I mean it. I just want to make sure you‚Äôre feeling as comfortable as you can. I know it can be a bit difficult to fall asleep in a bed you‚Äôre not used to. So just let me know if you need anything.



Y-yeah, good night.



\[some time passes\]



\[bedsheet sounds\]



\[talking in a lower voice from now on\]



Hmm, O-oh, I‚Äôm sorry, did I wake you up?

Oh,¬† you never fell asleep. Is it because I‚Äôm moving around too much? I‚Äôm sorry if that‚Äôs the case.



You're Just having a hard time falling asleep?



I-is it because of the coffee? I guess if I was gonna ask for you to stay over, I should‚Äôve just held off on the coffee shouldn't I.



Oh, it‚Äôs not that either.



\[chuckles\] yeah, I guess it might be the change of scenery, I guess it \*is\* your first time sleeping over‚Ä¶¬†



Well, to be honest, I \*kinda\* feel the same way \[chuckles\]



Well, No, I don't feel awkward, it's just..¬† different I guess. Just, having you here, so close to me. \[chuckles\] Kinda feels like a dream to be honest.



A good dream or a bad dream? Well, it‚Äôs certainly a \*very\* very good one. \[smiles\]



Mhm, I know I‚Äôve been trying to act all cool and stuff, as if it's just another night for me. Even though I've been nothing but a bumbling mess this whole time \[giggling\]. But no, it‚Äôs not \*just\* another night. It‚Äôs a lot more special than that. Because I have you right beside me. And even though my heart is pounding out of my chest right now, I know this is right. I know this is \*exactly\* where I want to be. Right beside you.



\[chuckles\] Yeah, my heart is beating \*so\* hard right now.



\[giggles\] Yours too?



Well, w-would you‚Ä¶¬† like to feel it? My heartbeat I mean.



Here, give me your hand.



\[placing hand on your chest\]



\[optional heartbeat¬† sound\]



Here, can you feel it? Yeah, I think having your heart over it made it beat even faster \[giggles\].



Huh? O-oh, yeah, I‚Äôd like to feel yours too.



\[places hand on his heart\]



Whoa, it's beating so fast¬† \[giggles\]. We really need to calm down¬† don't we? \[chuckles\].



You know, since we are feeling each other's heartbeat like this anyway, C-could we, maybe try to cuddle? I-I mean only if you‚Äôre okay with it of course.



W-we can!? O-okay, yeah! Let‚Äôs- let‚Äôs do it.



\[bedsheet sounds\]

So like, you want to spoon, or like want me to cuddle up on you?



Okay, yeah, we can try that. Here, I‚Äôll let you lay in the middle, I‚Äôll rest my head on your chest.



Are you comfortable this way?



Okay, that‚Äôs, that's good.



Yeah, I‚Äôm alright, I‚Äôm¬† comfortable this way, yeah.



\[deep breath\] This feels, nice. \[smiles\]



Mhm, it does.



Oh-oh, you're stroking my head.



N-no no! It feels really nice actually. \[chuckles\]



Yeah, it feels really good. I might actually fall asleep this way \[chuckles\].



Hmm? Did I dream about cuddling you like this? Well, not \*exactly\* like this, but, we will do those soon enough.



Yep, Now that we‚Äôve cuddled like this, we are gonna try a \*lot\* of different things together.



\[laughs\] Yeah, just give it some time, and I‚Äôll show you \*exactly\* the things I dream of.



No\~, it‚Äôs not a threat. It‚Äôs just a warning \[giggles\].



I am so glad, by the way. That you chose to stay. I know we‚Äôve been dating for a while now, but we‚Äôve never really been this‚Ä¶ intimate before. And now that we have, I am \*so\* glad that we have. Feeling my head on your chest. feeling it go up and down with each breath you take. Feeling your gentle breath brushing against my hair. Listening to your heartbeat, gently slowing down, but then raising with each movement I make. \[smiles\]. Feeling your sweet scent, and your soft hands, petting my head, ever so gently. It‚Äôs the best feeling I‚Äôve ever felt.



Mhm, it is.



\[yawns\] \[chuckles\] Yeah, I guess I am finally starting to feel sleepy.



\[smiles\] Yeah, let‚Äôs fall asleep, just like this.



Mhm. I want to know what it feels¬† like to wake up in your arms.



\[giggles\] Or I will just roll off the bed and wake up on the floor tomorrow.



\[giggles\] Oh\~, you won‚Äôt let me\~. Well, I guess we will find out tomorrow morning won't we?



\[smiles\] \[whispers\]¬† Good night.

Exhausted from a long day, I sat down on the cold metal floor and turned my head up. Looking up upon the starry sky, made me thankful for another day of being Super Earth's citizen and a child of liberty and freedom. The sound of fireworks going off in the distance and lighting up the sky in a bright and vibrant color. Accompanied by the roaring of the crowds surrounding me. The trail of fire that rained down to the ground warms my heart with such a beautiful sight. A sight that I have a privilege to see before I closed my eyes.

CHAPTER 1

I woke up in my government issued apartment, on my comfortable bed. My automated alarm clock went off, a jarring beep jolted insistently through my room, prompting me to get up. My shutters automatically opened letting the bright and warm sunlight inside. I stretched myself before I got up and turned off my alarm then walk towards my bathroom, washing myself of oil and dirt. Yesterday was rough, we have to double our production and put in mandatory overtime to meet the demanding quota. I don't mind working extra, it gives me more credits so I can work toward getting my request for a pet goldfish approved. Frankly speaking, I enjoyed doing overtime, for serving Super Earth is its own reward.

I put on my standard issue Super Earth blue jumpsuit, drank my stale coffee that I made yesterday. Another hefty stretch before I walked towards the door and opened it. The whirling sound of the motor hummed quietly before the door opened with a distinct \*hiss\* sound. A sound that I've heard a thousand times since I've been sent to this colony. I can see other loyal citizens of Super Earth getting out of the door. For each one I walked past, I greeted them with a smile and they return them, accompanied by all the overheard morning conversations and laughter filling the hallway.

Just a few strides before I was out from the apartment, a dazzling and bright golden ray from the sun shined onto my face. ""Another day of liberty and Freedom!"" I thought to myself before I walked toward the weapon factory.  
  
As I strolled down the well-maintained, smooth asphalt sidewalk lined by a row of neat and compact shrubs, I took time to admire my surroundings. The quiet residential area to my left with strong and sturdy single story terrace houses surrounded by impenetrable walls were shaded with evergreen trees. At the end of the fork in the road, I slowed my pacing in front of the public park. The lush greenery of the open and green space accompanied by meticulously paved walkways and a chorus of playful shouts from children of freedom always brings a slight grin to my face.

""I am proud of being a part of Super Earth!"" This thought ran through my head daily. Not a moment before I was greeted with a heroic statue of Super Earth's finest, the Helldiver, standing tall in front of the factory, shadowing over me, protecting me, protecting us.

I pulled out my identity card placing it onto the panel by the door to scan it before the sliding bypass door opened, letting me inside. Today, we have to start the shift in a rush because of the double production quota. Super Earth needs a surplus of weaponry to fill the ranks of her newly trained SEAF troopers, which we gladly provided.  
  
The whole factory was filled with a cacophony of machinery, working tirelessly to cut, weld and assemble carbon steel together to make battle-ready rifles. My job is to inspect any rifles that were passed onto the conveyor belt by the assembly machine looking for defected ones.¬† Thanks to our mandatory youth camp weapon training program, I can inspect them with quickness and precision. Especially when our supervisor is keeping his keen eyes on us.

""Hey, have you heard about the attack on the nearby system?"" My co-worker strike a conversation with another beside him.

""Yes, I heard it was a Terminid farm outbreak. But I think the Helldivers already took care of them, 'else we'd hear it from the news!"" The other co-worker replied.

""Heh, yeah. They'd never let us down, they always get the job done even before we know it."" I tell them with a smile on my face. ""They're the true patriots of Super Earth"" before I saluted with my right hand.

""Hey keep working!"" Our manager yelled down from the overhead balcony. We had to keep our head down and our hands busy with the gun but a brisk moment of eye contact that was made between us made time stopped for a second, only for it to resumed by our shit-eating grin and giggles.  
.

.

.  
  
Long and grueling hours have passed, multiple boxes sealed and packed meticulously that lined the cargo bay of the transport aircraft, were ready to be sent to the SEAF armory. Although it was late into the night, our work was not done yet as we still have to meet our quota before the night passes. But not before we take a mandatory 30 minutes break. I'll take that time for the opportunity to contact my family on the other side of the galaxy. I scanned my Super Credit code onto the long-distance communication device in the canteen.  
  
I dialed in the number of my family's communication device code and the screen lighted up ""Attempting to connect..."" a long pause...

""Bzzz hissss bzzzz....."" followed by constant static crackle ""Sorry, we encounter a communication problem, please try again later. Your super credit will be deducted for the attempt"" the screen goes dark, reflecting my image like a mirror.

""Damn it, the communication tower has to be down again! Last time it was down for a whole week, those guys can't even do their job properly even after the replacement."" I let my thoughts out.  
  
So I decided to grab calamari for dinner tonight, luckily it only costed a few requisitions and I have 20 minutes left on my break.

For just a moment before I'd almost finished with my meal, the bell rung, signaling for us to return to work.

.

The shift continued as usual, it was the same routine that I did a hundred of times today. As I inspected a faulty rifle I could hear a static chatter from the security guard's short-wave radio. I glanced over and covertly eavesdropped on the conversation out of curiosity.

""Come again, over."" He answered, pause and repeat ""Command, come again, over"" a persistent hissing sound that occasionally popped with faint chatter could be heard from his radio. He turned pale, sweat pooling up on his forehead, his hand shaken and he once again pushed the radio button and asked ""Confirmed? Over."" The voice from the radio answered ""Confirmed. Over."" He looked up, making eye contact with me before he unholstered his P-2 Peacemaker pistol.  
  
""Alright people, time to wrap this up. We got a situation here!"" He bellowed out, getting all the attention from the workers through all the machinery noises.

A distant rumbling noise can be heard from the outside, shaking the factory.  
  
""Shut them down, we have to go!"" He shouted ""Get your essential items and follow m-"" His sentence got cut short from the sudden blackout. The room went silent. An uncanny stillness hung in the air to the point that I could hear the sound of my own sweat-drops.  
  
The bombardment of rumbling continued, stirring the ground beneath us.

The emergency light turned on and filled the room with a glaring red light. The siren announced themselves blaring ear-splitting noises. Our attention was then all drawn to the sound of strained grunts that quickly ended into a dissonance of screaming. The security guard had his pistol drawn and took aim at the entrance. I could see that he is visibly shaking, I was shaken up too.  
  
This moment seemed like an eternity until a galloping-like heavy thumping sound can be heard from the outside, before something suddenly burst through the thick concrete wall, leaving a trail of dust and debris behind, prowling through all of our equipment and assembly line. Sounds of gun shots rang out. The muzzle flash lighted up the room like a spark for a mere moment, a mere moment too short to make anything out. I duck and dive to the left, narrowly avoiding the huge incoming silhouette, the security guard wasn't so lucky as I saw him got launched into the air like nothing. In a panic, I crawled my way under a conveyor belt hoping to find a hiding spot, luckily, I found one. I opened the maintenance hatch on the floor and crawled inside, praying and hoping to survive.  
  
The sounds of blood curdling screaming, crying, roaring, growling, slashing and smashing can be heard from the outside, erratic thuds of footsteps raced each other towards the exit combined with skittering of a hundred if not a thousand legs echoing through the factory. I curled up and listen to their screams ringing through my skull. I cried, not because I'm scared but because I'm a coward, I can't help them. I am not a Helldiver.

1j3f8oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/demisexuality/comments/1j3f8oy/dating_demi_on_apps/,Dating Demi on apps,"Heyo, so i‚Äôve made some comments about how my dating experience has been particularly in regards to apps, and wanted to share something interesting and am wondering if others feel the same way.

I‚Äôve shared in places about how dating apps stress me out and don‚Äôt make sense to me etc. etc.But recently, I‚Äôve matched with a couple of other ppl who are demi.

The first one put on her profile she was looking for new friends. Fine by me! I reached out, we chatted, met for coffee. It was probably my favorite date I had been on ever tbh. It was the first time I felt no pressure on a date. We talked a bit about dating and she shared some personal reasons why she was on the app. It was so freeing. 

I felt like, for the first time, I could just be myself. I didn‚Äôt have to pretend to be obsessed with her, didn‚Äôt have to impress her by being funny or make some move I wasn‚Äôt ready for. We went with the flow and had a nice chat and went for a walk and we texted a bit after. While we haven‚Äôt kept up with each other after a bit, which I totally expected due to the nature of our meet up, it all felt so right, like this is how it should be.

Fast forward to the other day and I match with another demi. We start messaging. Again, as soon as I learn they‚Äôre demi I feel a weight lifted off my shoulders. I no longer have the pressure to be some dude that needs to earn the girls love by being some sexy mysterious funny perfect being. I don‚Äôt have to be smitten or make some sparks fly from the first moment we meet. She‚Äôs just like me, and we‚Äôll chat, have common interests, maybe hang out, and see where things go. It feels so safe, so natural.

Idk if I‚Äôll find my person, or find enough demi people to make a connection with one. But it feels soooo much easier and freeing whenever I match with one of you. I wish I could just set my profile to only other demi‚Äôs but I know it‚Äôs not feasible. It just makes it all feel so much more real and not like I‚Äôm getting looked at under a microscope as we try and actually build a connection instead - constructive rather than scrutinizing

She was diabetic and had been taking insulin for the past 4 years.
It all started when my mother had severe menorrhagia. The scan revealed that there are several fibroids in uterus and the doctor advised to undergo hysterectomy. Her haemoglobin levels were low and the surgery couldn't be immediately performed. 3 weeks later, when the haemoglobin levels were near normal, she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy. Bilateral DJ stenting was also done as there were renal calculi. She was stable and discharged from the hospital a week later. The doctor informed us to visit after 2 weeks, however he didn't mention about DJ stenting ( I later came to know that after 3 weeks after reading discharge summary). 1 week post discharge, my mother had severe constipation, loss of appetite and severe vomitting. My mother was afraid to go the hospital again, as she thought the medications prescribed were too strong, that her stomach pain was unbearable. She also had chills and fever in the night. We consulted general physicians, they suggested blood and urine tests. The serum creatinine levels were high, it increased to 2.7mg/dL.  Wbc counts were also high.I didn't knew this, as after surgery I went to my work location. My father was taking care, this whole time. The creatinine levels were increasing at a rate of 1 mg/dL / week. When I knew this, the creatinine was 4 mg/dL. I insisted to visit the doctor who performed the surgery. He said that the stenting was temporary and need to be removed after two weeks, and that might be causing the infection. She was again admitted in the hospital. Stenting was removed. My mother said that there were heavy fluid and pus discharge. Her wbc levels settled in 2 days. But the overall condition didn't improve. Creatinine was still high, and sodium dropped to 113. After treating for a week, the doctor advised to shift her to higher medical centre. We shifted her to the nearest multi speciality hospital. The treating doctor said that scan revealed ascites build up and  nephritis is causing toxins to build up in the blood. There were also white snowy particles in the urine. He said that it might be fungal infection and prescribed anti fungals.He performed long dura stenting and said that she will be fine in a week. 3 days later, the condition didn't improve and during this whole time she had fluid build up in her legs and hand, Edema. The doctor said that the fluid will be removed, as the kidney recovers. She couldn't eat, pass stools this whole time. The vomitting also didn't stop. The vomit was like black grounded coffee. When they did endoscopy, they found the walls of oesophagus was inflamed, suggesting oesophagitis. Hence to ease the recovery,, ryles tube was inserted, to give semi liquid food. My mother hesitated but, the doctor also said that to avoid aspirated pneumonitis, ryles tube is necessary. On the same day, after 3 hours after ryles tube was inserted, my mother had difficulty breathing. Her spo2 levels dropped to 85. Oxygen mask was put. The doctor said that she somehow aspirated, and there has been Edema in her lungs. They did dialysis that night and shifted her to IMCU. The next day, my mother was feeling good. I spoke to her and I was so confident that she will be discharged in a week. Because for the first time, since a month, I heard her voice so loud, her eyes was clear and she as well sounded confident. Two days after she passed in IMCU. I still couldn't believe it. It's been 3 months, and I am the same. Could someone help me on this, what could have happened. I can share additional details or reports, if needed.
My doubts are,
1. She never had a renal disease in the past. 6 months back she underwent eye operation. Creatinine at that time was 1.2.

Like this morning. All I ask is that they key me into the med room because I don‚Äôt have access, and they treat it like I‚Äôm asking them to saw their own legs off. They won‚Äôt say hi to me, they won‚Äôt give me any sort of decent human curtesy like a smile or wave, they just speak to their co workers like I‚Äôm not there, refuse to look at me, and fail to acknowledge when I say thanks or ‚Äúneed anything else?‚Äù 

Like fine girl. If you don‚Äôt want your supply rooms stocked, don‚Äôt come crying over the phone to me when you run out of something. 

And it‚Äôs not all nurses, but the lack of patience or niceness to people who aren‚Äôt like in their little circle of work friends happens alot more than it should. 


And By the way, our ICU, ER and MedSurge is completely empty this morning. It‚Äôs not like I was disturbing her from something important. She was drinking coffee and chatting with her friends before the morning staff switch. I never take it personally when it‚Äôs really busy and they‚Äôre all scrambling around trying to tend to 20+ people. But completely empty hospital 30 minutes before your shift ends? Come on now.

I was back home with my basket üß∫ after a walk of shame.(other elder here  warned me about) I was informed that a list will be given to me.  My beautiful decorated (Oya) basket was left on the floor and I was instructed to take it back. I feel that being the 1st time I presented a basket,1st time this  elder received one plus the elder told me to start one with out instruction, should have be treated another way as a teaching moment and not as a sour experience.

I asked to set a tempting kariocha date since I have the funds and the Ita said I'm ready to go, Elder said no, maybe next yr since is too much work for her( is a 3 ppl small ile). I asked if we can start working this year toward my possible kariocha next year, the answer was silence.

I decided to stay in the class but the rest of the night I was ostracized by my G siblings, I'm an introvert person in a house full of extroverts. I'm quiet, observant but courteous.  I prefer to listen my elders and learn instead talking about me. when is time to share , I do share.

Everyone , was given a time to talk about their spiritual beginning I was skipped and later accused of not being open to share with others after they were vulnerable sharing. I was accused of being uninterested in the class since I was not participating in the vaping and dark jokes  were saying that I did not find funny. example. ""poisoning your coworkers coffee"" ""put coworkers in the prenda pot"" . Everyone, shared phone numbers and social media I was not asked, we were sitting in the same couch. 

A God sibling started mentioning in my presence how  he disliked/hate immigrant women from my country.  I'm the only woman that born in that country in the ile,I couldn't take it anymore, I respected the ile and the orishas altars and did not said anything , I  excused myself and left. 

 Unfortunately, I have to make some decisions in where my spiritual path will go in the near future. I'm beyond heart broken sad/crying since this is my 2nd ile, my 1st ile my padrino passed and his ile (3ppl) disintegrated. I missed him so much , He really loved me and never had those ideas about my persona, he was justo man. I'm sad he didn't have the time to crowned me :(",0,1741106639.0,Santeria,3,0.5,False
1j3f3s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/vipassana/comments/1j3f3s0/my_experience_at_southeast_vipassana_center/,My Experience at Southeast Vipassana Center (Dhamma PatƒÅpa) ‚Äì Women‚Äôs Side,"I recently completed my first 10-day Vipassana course at the Southeast Vipassana Center (Dhamma PatƒÅpa) in Jesup, Georgia. Before going, I searched Reddit for details about the center, especially from the women‚Äôs side, and found very little, so I wanted to share my experience.

# Accommodations

All female students had private rooms with private bathrooms, each equipped with plenty of shelf space, a personal AC/heater, and a digital alarm clock. There was more than enough room for storage‚ÄîI brought a large rolling duffle bag and could have fit double the amount of stuff. Two large suitcases could easily slide under the bed.

Each residence had a supply room stocked with extra paper products, towels, sheets, clothing, shoes, and toiletries (toothpaste, tampons, combs, etc.), which was great in case you forgot something. The center wasn‚Äôt kidding about the smoke detectors‚Äîthey *will* go off if you don‚Äôt close the bathroom door and turn on the vent while showering. Read all the signs‚Äîthey‚Äôre actually helpful!

On the men‚Äôs side, I was told that four people have private rooms but share a bathroom. All the other male students have private rooms and bathrooms. They have capacity for 35 female and 35 male students. 

# Food

If you‚Äôre used to a low-carb diet like I am, be prepared for a lot of carbs at breakfast: oatmeal, stewed prunes, cold cereal, toast, English muffins, apples, oranges, and bananas. I brought MCT oil and just drank tea with that in the morning, then had lunch at 11 AM. There was Folgers instant coffee available, but I stuck to tea.

Lunch was filling and tasty. I skipped the 5 PM fruit for the same reason‚Äîcarbs. Over 11 days, I lost 8 pounds (BMI \~22), but I felt the calorie deficit actually enhanced my mental clarity and focus.

**Hot water access:** The only place to get hot water for tea or coffee was in the dining hall during meal times. Someone on this sub recommended bringing an insulated cup, which was a pro tip! I could make tea and sip it while walking the grounds. There was also filtered water in the dining hall and each residence.

# What I Brought & Found Useful

* **Travel yoga mat** ‚Äì While yoga isn‚Äôt allowed, light stretching in my room after long sits was a lifesaver.
* **Thick, cozy socks** ‚Äì February was chilly, and these were great for the meditation hall.
* **Slip-on shoes (Crocs, etc.)** ‚Äì Essential for frequent trips between buildings.
* **My own cushion** ‚Äì I love my Moonleap cushion, but the center provided base cushions, extra pillows, blankets, and even backrests upon request. By the end of the course, about 80% of the women were using a backrest or sitting in a chair. Fewer men seemed to use back support.
* **Digital watch** ‚Äì Many women had them. I was envious at times, dying to know how long we‚Äôd been sitting, but maybe it‚Äôs better not to know. Still torn on that one.
* **Nail clippers & file** ‚Äì The one thing I *didn‚Äôt* bring but really wished I had.

# The Grounds & Facilities

There‚Äôs a small pond on the women‚Äôs side, though in winter, the landscape was pretty brown and drab. There were walking paths on both sides, but the ones on the women‚Äôs side were short. However, walking around the center during the afternoon break was a nice way to stretch.

Since the only bathrooms are in your private room, expect a lot of walking between buildings. It rained for about four days, so I was glad I brought a small travel umbrella (though the center had extras).

# Final Thoughts

The center truly wants you to succeed. Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask the assistant teacher or course manager if you need something. My experience was overwhelmingly positive, and I‚Äôm deeply grateful for this opportunity and the kindness of the volunteers who made it possible.

If you‚Äôre considering taking a course at Dhamma PatƒÅpa, I highly recommend it. Hope this helps future students!",12,1741106623.0,vipassana,1,1.0,False

Recently, she invited me to meet for a coffee and talk, but later withdrew, so we didn‚Äôt see each other. Throughout this time, I told her that I‚Äôd like to meet up and reconnect, but she said she still has certain fears she hasn‚Äôt worked through yet (most likely related to my mistakes).

I was going to get one last bottle of wine that day but fought the urge and decided I've already had 1000 ""last drinks"" and one of those would suffice.

  
I hit six months over the weekend. Surrounded by friends doing the stuff I'd normally be getting shitfaced doing, except sober now. Having more ACTUAL fun instead of tricking my brain into thinking it's having fun, and waking up feeling refreshed the next morning instead of wasting half of my weekend recovering in bed.

  
There was something different this time, maybe it was how far I fell beforehand I'm not exactly sure. But now it isn't ""I'm not drinking right now"" or ""I'm taking a break"". It's a firm ""I don't drink"". Those cravings still hit and they're sneaky little bitches, but I feel like I understand the lie now. I can't moderate and that's okay. I can feel a little sorry for myself that these are my genetics and then move on and focus on dealing with the hand I'm dealt and enjoying the real shit.

  
I get to wake up and do my little morning ritual again. Coffee and Crosswords to ease into the day. I hadnt done that in months and I get to have it back, how great is that? Sure as hell beats rolling around in my bed waiting for the nausea to subside. NA Beer and Kombucha have been a great replacement for the wine I'd typically reach for when cooking/cleaning. My amazing partner doesn't have to see me in a drunken stupor anymore.

  
Huge thank you to everyone here. I mostly just lurk but doing so when those damn cravings hit has been tremendously helpful. We can all do this! Your successes and slip-ups have inspired me and I hope mine inspire you. I'll share the wisdom I read here that helped me the most when I first started my sober journey:

My partner - Jack, M25

My brother - Nick, M30

My sister - Nina, F28

His partner - Josh, M29

  
Nick and Josh live in another city, but in mid-February Jack and I decided to visit them. The first day went well, but when I woke up the second day Josh was running around the house and swearing a lot. 

Nick was sitting in the kitchen, drinking coffee and doing something on his laptop. I asked him what was going on.  He said that Josh didn't do his chores yesterday, so now he's late for work. I asked what chores. Nick started listing: not doing the dishes, not making food for work, and not cleaning the shoes he wanted to wear to work.    He also said that Josh forgot to charge his phone before going to bed.



I asked Nick why he wasn't doing anything about it. His partner was clearly stressed and needed help and he was just sitting there? That seemed odd to me but Nick said he ""reminded him 3 times the day before so now it's Josh problem, not his + technically he (Nick)  is at work now"".  I didn't like that answer, so I suggested that maybe I could help. Like, make a sandwich for him or something.  Nick told me to sit down and do nothing.



Later, after Josh back from work, Nick and Jack went shopping. I took advantage of this and  ask Josh if everything was okay, how his day was, etc. I didn't want to be pushy, but I really didn't like how  Nick was treating him. I wanted to make sure everything was okay now. 

  
But in evening Nick came to me and said that Josh had talked to him and that ""I shouldn't care that much about their relationship."".  He told me that Josh is not a little kid and  not need help.  I told him I didn't see Josh as a little kid. I was just worried + I couldn't imagine behaving that way towards my partner. But Nick became very defensive and started saying things like ""well, good thing Josh is not your partner."". Jack doesn't think I did anything wrong, but when I told Nina what happened, she said I really shouldn't interfere and I should keep my thoughts to myself sometimes.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

* Good technical chops
* Super lightweight and very comfortable
* Good build quality and flexible materials
* One set of spare pads included
* In-line microphone is the icing on the cake
* Affordable price

# Cons

# Introduction

Snowsky, as many of you probably already know about, is a new FiiO sub-brand that‚Äôs focusing on old-school looking portable gear. Together with the Snowsky Echo Mini and Retro Nano, the Snowsky on-ear headphones were released targeting those who like vintage-looking headphones like the ones that used to be shipped with older walkman players. In this review, I‚Äôll be sharing my own opinion on the Snowsky Wind and I will try to compare it with some of its peers.

>*Disclaimer: the Snowsky Wind were sent to me by FiiO so that I could write an honest review. This review represents my personal opinion on the set, it isn't promotional or paid content and I don‚Äôt get any revenue from the sales of this product.*  
*At the time of the review, the Snowsky were sold for $19.99 at FiiO‚Äôs Official Aliexpress Store.*

# Technical Specifications

* Driver Configuration ‚Üí 1 x 40mm Dynamic Driver (Japan Imported PET Composite Diaphgram)
* Impedance ‚Üí 32 Œ©
* Spec-sheet Frequency Response ‚Üí 20Hz-20kHz¬†
* Sensitivity ‚Üí 116 dB/Vrms@1kHz
* Cable ‚Üí 1.25m braided fixed cable
* Plug Type ‚Üí 3.5mm

# Packaging

The packaging of the Snowsky Wind is very colored yet pretty basic inside. In fact, it only contains:

* The Snowsky Wind
* A pair of spare/replacement pads
* User manual

I want to add that some brands include very few tips or no accessories, yet Fiio still included one pair of spare pads for such a cheap price (and this is a big plus).

# Design, Build Quality, Comfort and Isolation

The combination between the plastic ear cups and the metal headband makes up for a good looking, lightweight and sturdy set for your everyday usage. The design kind-of reminds me the old Sony MDR-3, a vintage pair of headphones that were sold together with their TPS-L2 cassette player (curiosity: this is the cassette player from which Moondrop has designed the case of their Golden Ages 1979 TWS set).The pads can swivel a bit, the clamping force is not a problem at all, the comfort is amazing and they don‚Äôt become uncomfortable on the head even after very long sessions.

Isolation is not a thing, just like with any other on-ear headphone.

If anything, despite the very light pressure applied on the ears can seem like an overly positive thing, having a bit more clamping force would help keeping the headphones in a more stable fit while running or doing some activity that involves moving.Since I use this set mostly when I am sitting at my desk, this doesn‚Äôt bother me and instead I‚Äôm super happy that they gently stay on my ears without bothering me even after very long sessions.

# Cable

The cable is fixed, it‚Äôs very flexible and lightweight and my only complaint is that there isn‚Äôt any strain relief near the earcups. I am very careful with every set that I get my hands on, but those who aren‚Äôt should be careful while carrying these in a backpack without any sort of case/cover (and, well, I am not going to complain for the absence of a case, especially considering the price of the Wind).There is a remote mic on the cable and I will try to include a test in the sound section so that everyone can have an idea on its recording performance (don‚Äôt expect studio-grade recording capabilities, so keep your expectations on the lower side).

# Sound

**GEAR USED FOR THE TEST**

* DAC: Topping E30¬†
* AMP: Topping L30, FiiO A3
* Mobile phones: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Xiaomi Mi A3, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra
* Moondrop May‚Äôs DSP cable with PEQ=0
* Wired Dongles: Apple Type-C dongle, Fosi DS2, RZ200M dongle
* Bluetooth DACs: Snowsky Retro Nano
* Portable DAPs: Snowsky Echo Mini, Benjie S8/AGPTEK M30B
* Bluetooth Adapters: KBEAR S1, KZ AZ10¬†
* Other sources: Presonus AudioBox iONE, Elgato Wave XLR

**Amplifier needed?**

No, it‚Äôs not strictly needed, even though using a good source is always a good idea.

**Let‚Äôs speak about the sound.**

The Snowsky Wind are V-shaped with some emphasis on the bass and treble regions.  
Since these are on-ear headphones, the sub-bass isn‚Äôt as visceral as it is on some closed-back cans or IEMs, but it‚Äôs there and you can hear it even though you don't really ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the rumble. The bass, instead, is punchy and adds some proper dynamism to the overall sound. It‚Äôs not the fastest or most textured bass around, but it sounds fun.  
The midrange is slightly scooped in but this doesn‚Äôt really cause any coherency issue whatsoever; the main issue is that the vocals are pushed backwards so if you‚Äôre searching for a pair of on-ear cans to listen to your favourite singer‚Äôs voice, then these are not for you (or, better said, these could be for you if you‚Äôre able to accept this compromise).  
The treble is spicy and this adds some air and sparkle to the overall sound, but I think these could and should have been smoother. The detail retrieval is pretty good too, but this comes at the expense of a slightly more fatiguing treble. The main point isn‚Äôt about these being brighter, the point is having some mid-range recession and then some treble peaks, which cause some spiciness that doesn‚Äôt translate in a constantly bright sound (which would be somewhat ‚Äúsmoother‚Äù).  
I honestly like them anyway as treble peaks don‚Äôt really bother me if the sound is still fun and far from being like a sewing needle in my ears, but I get that some may not like the treble tuning here.

The **soundstage** rendering is pretty wide yet with very limited depth and height, and the **imaging** is fairly precise as well, especially considering the price range and the type of product.

**Is ‚ÄúGrado Pads mod even a thing here?‚Äù**

No, it isn‚Äôt. The Wind become very sibilant, super bright and the bass decreases so much that they become unusable, at least in my opinion.

**Are they something I would use considering my taste and preferences?**

Yes. The fun-oriented tuning and the exceptional comfort make up for a great day-to-day set, especially when you don‚Äôt need outstanding performance or when you need to have a soft music background while doing other things. Low volume daily companion, this is what I consider them.

# Sound

**Snowsky Wind vs ROSESELSA Distant Mountain**

>The Wind play in a league on their own when it comes to comfort, since the Distant Mountain have a lot of clamping force and become uncomfortable after about 15 minutes of listening. Sure, you can always stretch them over books for some time, but if we speak about the out-of-the-box experience, the Wind are much more comfortable. If we speak about pure technical performance, the Distant Mountain take the lead: better low-end punch and textures, faster bass, superior resolution, and even better imaging. The Wind, instead, have a wider soundstage and they are slightly less weird when it comes to vocals, even though they still have a pretty spicy treble that treble-sensitive folks aren‚Äôt gonna like. If you like EQing, the Distant Mountain are very good since the driver quality is superior, but if you want a ready-to-play set, then the Wind are very good for the price (the Distant mountain costs about 3.5x times the price of the Wind, so‚Ä¶). The build quality of the Distant Mountain is a lot better than the Wind, but we‚Äôre talking about a much higher price as well.The Distant Mountain come with better packaging and accessories and a better cable, which is also detachable (the Wind, instead, have a fixed cable).

**Snowsky Wind vs Koss KSC75**

>Everyone wants to know if the Wind can beat the budget on-ear king aka Koss KSC75, and the short answer is ‚Äúnope‚Äù. The Wind provide for a more traditional wearing experience thanks to the flexible metal headband, but if you don‚Äôt dislike clip-on earphones the true advantages of the Wind end here. The Wind are more V-shaped, with a more recessed midrange and a spicier treble. The KSC75, on the other hand, still have some low-end, but the fact is that the midrange isn‚Äôt as recessed as on the Wind so they end up having less ‚Äúbody‚Äù in the low-end. The KSC75 still dominate when it comes to the midrange and treble, with more forward and more lively vocals, better resolution and slightly superior detail retrieval, along with a more coherent response that is constantly on the brighter side without true peaks, so they end up being smoother and more natural overall. The Wind seem to play in a more open sound field because the midrange recession helps in this regard, and the low-end is a tad punchier, but the KSC75 win on every other aspect in my opinion. The build quality is better on the Wind, that also look and feel more flexible for the day-to-day usage. Comfort is great on both, depending on what you prefer. The cable of the KSC75 is worse and doesn‚Äôt even have an in-line microphone (which is a missed opportunity). The Wind come with a better packaging and a pair of spare pads, whereas the KSC75 come with nothing else in the box.

**Snowsky Wind vs Koss KPH30i**

>The KHP30i are warmer, they have better note weight and slightly superior textures, and this mostly because the more polite treble makes up for a warmer, more mature and slightly fuller sound. The midrange is less recessed on the KPH30i, with slightly leaner vocals and a more mature yet less detailed treble response. The Wind, on their side, play in a wider soundstage and can extract a few more bits of information, but this comes at the expense of a more fatiguing sound overall, especially if you listen at medium to high volumes. The imaging is mostly on par with a slight advantage for the Wind, mostly because of the more emphasized treble and the wider soundstage. When it comes to comfort, the Wind are easier to like because they have very little clamping force, whereas the KHP30i have some clamping (even though it‚Äôs not dramatic), but I like the fact that the KPH30i clamp a bit more because this gives the bass more weight (the driver pushes a bit more on the ears) and the headphones are a bit more stable on my head while I am walking or doing something at home. Isolation is not a thing on both, maybe the KPH30i insulate a tad more because of the slightly stronger clamp. The build quality is so-so on the KPH30i and the Wind look and feel more flexible and less delicate for daily usage.Packaging and accessories are better on the Wind, since they also come with a set of spare pads, whereas the KPH30i‚Äôs in-line microphone is better. You can do the Grado Pads mod on the KPH30i, you can‚Äôt with the Wind. The KPH30i cost almost twice as much as the Wind, at least here in Europe, but I would honestly spend what I‚Äôve spent for the KPH30i again, again and again.

**Snowsky Wind vs Shini S520**

>It‚Äôs surprising to see the Shini S520 compared with pricier on-ear sets, especially because it costs as much as a coffee-break. Even though you can‚Äôt expect the same level of performance of the Wind, I‚Äôd say that the S520 are a great starting point, with a very respectable tuning for such a low price. I am not even going to discuss about the technical aspects since the Wind completely delete the S520 when it comes to soundstage, imaging and detail retrieval, but if I have to give the edge to the S520 on something in particular, then it‚Äôs the midrange, which is more forward and more natural than on the Wind. The Wind sound a bit more ‚Äúold-school‚Äù, more V-shaped, more technical yet less neutral. The S520 come in a plastic bag, so packaging isn‚Äôt even a thing. Comfort goes to the Wind hands down, isolation is non-existent on both sets.

# Final Thoughts

If we consider that the Wind are the first on-ear headphone from Snowsky, I can only say that they‚Äôve done a good job: this vintage-looking set sounds fun, it‚Äôs super lightweight, the technical performance is pretty good for the price and the price itself is very attractive. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a perfect set because of the spicy treble and the recessed midrange that cause some timbrical inconsistencies, especially at higher volumes, but everything else makes up for an affordable set that is correctly priced and that sounds fun enough to be worth picking up.

In my opinion, the KSC75 and KPH30i still dominate in their respective price tags, but the Wind is a breath of fresh air and I really hope to see Snowsky releasing an upgraded/improved version of the Wind, trying to face and beat Koss‚Äô products that are still the undisputed kings of the affordable on-ear market.",2,1741105650.0,headphones,5,1.0,False

I have my pre-infusion set to 3 seconds at lower pressure (around 2-3 bar), but I‚Äôve noticed that during this short pre-infusion phase, I see coffee drops forming in my cup.

From what I understand, pre-infusion should mainly saturate the puck before actual flow begins. So, is it normal to see coffee drops that early? Could this indicate an issue with my grind size, puck preparation, or pre-infusion pressure? The coffee is,  nonetheless, great.

I first walked into the store wanting to look at the SBGX261 after having seen so many videos on it and the incredible state of the art quartz movement inside. After having tried on the 261, the associate asked if I was interested in trying on the champagne dial. 

At first I was hesitant because I didn‚Äôt want my decision to be swayed by anything else, but I figured why not just give it a look.

Honestly, initially, I was fairly underwhelmed with the 263 and didn‚Äôt think much of it. But as I kept trying it on in the boutique, something about the dial continued to attract me over the dial of the 261.

I went for some coffee to contemplate which watch I‚Äôd go with but I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how beautiful the champagne dial was on the 263. It had the same movement that I was in awe of in the 261. And most importantly, I could see myself in the 263. I could see it being a daily driver, traveling with it, wearing it in both formal and informal settings. This is something I couldn‚Äôt picture as well with the 261.

3 days into owning the watch and I‚Äôm continuing to fall in love with it more each day. The simplicity of the design matched with the complexity of craftsmanship continues to wow me every time I look at it. Amazing price point to get into GS and I have zero regrets.

1j3el0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j3el0r/aita_for_being_hurt_that_my_friend_talked_about/,AITA for being hurt that my friend talked about her problems to me less than 24 hours after the loss of my dog?,"So there‚Äôs a long complicated back story to our friendship, but for the sake of this particular situation I‚Äôll give only necessary details. My best friend has had a lot happen to her in the past 5 years including the loss of her dog and her father. There have been good things like her marriage, birth of her daughter, and getting her dream job. All for which I was there for.. the bad and the good. She‚Äôs been there for me too, but our friendship mostly revolved/revolves around her life and her problems as my problems aren‚Äôt bad enough to care if I get much space to talk about them to her and I don‚Äôt have a partner or children so my life is less complicated. That being said, I did have a dog who was 12 year old and he started getting sick a few weeks ago and I was really struggling because I knew we were nearing the end, but I was keeping him comfy and keeping an eye on him knowing at any point I‚Äôd have to make a decision on his quality of life (something she‚Äôs actually been through). She was being so negative about it all when I tried to lean on her that I had to tell her to stop being so negative about it because it was causing me a lot of added anxiety. She agreed to, but we just stopped talking about him and I sort of bounced back as he seemed to be bouncing back.

A week and a half goes by and one day he‚Äôs not okay and I end up having to go to the emergency vet and put him down. It was 2 Thursdays ago. I told her via text and she sent very loving apolgoies and came over the next afternoon and brought coffee and something to nibble on. I thought it was super sweet and she let me cry and talk about it for a little bit, but then turned the conversation to her issues that we had been talking about for months now on a nearly daily basis. She ended up crying about her problems and I hugged her and she left. She came over again that Sunday and proceeded to do the same thing. Giving me little time to talk about my grief. 

I feel guilty for being incredibly hurt that she couldn‚Äôt give me just one day of focusing on my grief, especially less than 24 hours after my actual best friend of 12 years had passed instead of adding more to my plate by complaining about her issues. I specifically feel guilty because she was sweet enough to come over and bring me things both times. I feel like I‚Äôm being ungrateful because she was nice enough to bring me things and I know other people have problems too and I‚Äôm not trying to downplay those. Something just seems off balance in our friendship and it just seems unfair. Am I the asshole for being incredibly hurt? So much so that it‚Äôs making me re-evaluate our friendship.",1,1741105357.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Our first date was pretty good, we went for coffee and just walked around a bit and talked. We got along well and afterwards I sent her a standard ‚Äúit was nice hanging out with you‚Äù and she responded positively saying that it was ‚Äúvery lovely‚Äù and ‚Äúsweet‚Äù, she also asked which days i was free on the weekend.

When I asked if she wanted to hang out again it took her more than a day to respond. Now, she‚Äôs told me that she‚Äôs a very bad texter so I didn‚Äôt mind this too much (even though it did bum me out a bit cause she‚Äôs done this before ). When she did respond she said yes and invited me to a thing with her friends on the weekend (the day that I said I was free).

Now, given the fact that she takes a long time to respond + inviting me to hang with her friends - idk if this is her way of softly rejecting me and offering for us to be just friends instead?

I will most likely say no since I feel a bit uncomfortable meeting her friends so soon since I also barely know her and I also definitely don‚Äôt want to intrude if this is her way of saying ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no romantic connection here‚Äù.

I just want to know if it‚Äôs normal to invite people from dating apps to hang out with you and your friends on a second date? What is going on?",1,1741105347.0,LesbianActually,2,1.0,False
